" Ressurgence is visually spetacular, but this sequence continues the fight between humans and aliens in a lazy way, without inspiration or great moments
",2021-04-10 00:00:00,5,"Roland Emmerich's newest film carries with it countless influences from the catharsis and exaggeration of the cinema of the 1990s. Without fear of being tacky, Roland Emmerich's film detaches itself from any didacticism and entrusts the spectator with the task of entertaining himself with the absurd. The alien invasion has the air of a frantic game nowadays, full of top quality effects that are only concerned with enchanting and entertaining during the almost two hours of duration.Emmerich has no interest in debating or even raising political issues. In fact, everything appears free of charge, creating a fragile basis for a new confrontation between humans and aliens. Therefore, the formula found is to mix heroes from the previous battle with a new generation, endowed with the necessary vigor for yet another conflict. Only, if the old ones sound like a mere repetition of the original, the newbies do not demonstrate the charisma necessary to take the reins as protagonists. In other words, the film fails at the two ends that should serve as a foundation.Hiller is the son of Will Smith's character in the first film. In the story, he passed away in the first test of a spaceship that mixes human technology with alien and is treated like an idol by the population. Dylan is not the only one who continues with his father's legacy. Maika Monroe plays Patricia Whitmore, daughter of ex-President Whitmore, Bill Pullman's character who returns with a lot of importance in the plot. The same goes for David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), Julius Levinson (Judd Hirsch) and Dr. Okun (Brent Spiner) - the old guard of the first feature. And all of them, new and old, intersect in the second wave of attacks by the aliens shown in The Resurgence. Bringing back the characters in the first film, works for nostalgia, but all the roles played by them are laughable; with only Goldblum being really essential. Seeing Pullman embodying a crazy version of former President Thomas Whitmore elicits significant laughter, once becoming too stupid. And even if we are talking about aliens and galactic invasions, the solution to bring Dr. Okun back is simply unfortunate. Finally, I think we can all agree that seeing Hirsch played in a subplot with random children on a school bus is completely expendable.History and script should definitely not be a concern here. The absurdly bloated script of names like Nicolas Wright, James A. Woods, Dean Devlin, James Vanderbilt and Roland Emmerich himself is an endless mess, with pierced plans and a thematic repetition that borders on the absurd at different times. The entire plan of the Terrans to defeat the aliens revolves around yet another stolen device, again, and now we have a mysterious symbol that acts as the main MacGuffin of the first act, only to later discover that it is something very sudden. And it is laughable to see that the aliens establish a kind of mental connection with some of the characters.The script seeks to infantile the adventure at all times, whether through rough dialogues or caricatures involving minorities. There is also a repetition of situations from the original film, such as the insistence around President Whitmore's famous speech and the attempt to replicate it, without success (although it has a great reference to ""Contact"" involving the original speech) and a handful of questions without logical answers about the direction of the battle, involving a virtual being who has an essential participation in the conflict. Apart from the various emotional triggers with children and dogs, which appear here and there in order to bring a supposed drama to the battle at the moment.And this excess of writers highlight one of the main problems of this continuation, which is its absolute lack of identity coupled with a montage without any structure, which makes the film seem much longer than it really is, with jokes that don't work, and cores without any importance. The first film tastefully embodied the spirit of the 1960s B-movies fueled by a first-rate budget, as well as having a Will Smith at the height of his comic timing and improvisational skills (basically the entire anthological scene of Smith carrying a alien through the desert was improvised). This ""Independence Day - The Resurgence"", on the other hand, does not know exactly what it wants to be. His greatest success is to show how much 2016 of his narrative differs from the one in which we live and to show - even in an inconstant way - how the daily life of that world changed due to the 1996 war. At the same time, the film ""reference"" (aham) shamelessly productions like ""Aliens - The Rescue"", ""Godzilla"", ""Macross"" and ""Star Patrol"", never finding a voice of their own, looking more like a Frankenstein monster from sci-fi franchises - even the soundtrack, in a few moments, it seems taken from ""Star Wars"".In addition to the alien invasion, Emmerich, Devlin and company clog the projection with ill-fitting plots, such as the poorly established rivalry between pilots Jake (Liam Hemsworth) and Dylan (Jessie T. Usher), the latter son of Will Smith's character, who passed away between the two films. In addition, we have the ""madness"" of two characters from the original, former US President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) and scientist Dr. Okun (Brent Spiner), the romance between Jake and Patty Whitmore (Maika Monroe), the disastrous decisions by the current president (Sela Ward), the research by David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) and his colleague Catherine (Charlotte Gainsbourg), the appearance of an African military chief (Deobia Oparei) and several Chinese characters, the meaningless appearances some from Vivica A. Fox and Judd Hirsch in the course of the projection.Visual exaggerations and Emmerich's sense of space and camera movement are the greatest asset of The Resurgence. As in the first film, when the German managed to give the exact scale of the disasters, he did not forget to transmit the grandeur of the destruction on screen. Humans are always placed alongside alien spaceships and the sights serve as a reference for the size of the impact. The good news of this sequence is the ability to work on spatial effects in completely different and unprecedented situations, when compared to Emmerich's previous works. The Star Wars of the second act and the final battle are examples of how a good edition manages to place the spectator well in a fight that takes place, at least, in two places at the same time. And in both situations, Independence Day diversifies the tone of the action. In one he brings a spatial shooting full of colors and agility in the camera, while in the other he shows a monstrous and slow fight, without losing the impact that the climax of a blockbuster like this needs to have.However, what really surprises is the low relevance of the action scenes, their usual specialty. The mystery surrounding the ships in the original film has been completely abandoned, and the attack itself is nothing more than a handful of buildings and objects flying aimlessly in order to cause as much destruction as possible. No emblematic scenes, like the destruction of the White House from the previous film. Interestingly, the most interesting action scene is set in an inhospitable desert, where the main alien antagonist wins a battle at the height; with a clear inspiration in the life cycle of the creatures of 'Aliens, The Rescue'. In the final scenes it is funny to think that a giant alien responsible for the extermination of populations on other planets ends up being distracted by a yellow bus full of children. In addition, the ease with which the antagonist is defeated is super uncomfortable.At the end of the projection, it is not difficult to guess why the film did not do well at the box office and stoned by critics. While the first film featured a tightly knit plot filled with clever plot twists (like the way humans took to destroy the mother ship's shield), the sequence abuses the improbable and the impossible. The truncated plot brings about twenty different central characters, and tries to highlight each of them, failing miserably. After a promising first act, the film is lost in several parallel and unnecessary plots, giving the impression that the script written in five hands was a collection of short stories sewn by an amateur screenwriter. The jokes don't work as they should, and the dramatic scenes elicit involuntary laughter from the audience. The aliens, who in the first film were hidden and shadowy figures, here take physical form and set out to fight, totally destroying the grace and suspense surrounding intergalactic beings.The Resurgence does not hide, at any time, that it just wants to be an escape, a moment of fun that includes a dispute between aliens and humans. Their characters and attitudes remain silly and a good part of the dialogues (or speeches) are as cheesy as the first film - and none of that bothers to the point of disturbing the experience, as there is no suggestion of discussion or depth in the story here. This sequence continues the fight between humans and aliens in a lazy way, without inspiration or great moments. If Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman reappear as echoes of their importance in the past, the rookie trio formed by Liam Hemsworth, Jessie Usher and Maika Monroe sounds like a mere caricature, without any emotional depth. In addition to the banal action scenes and the clumsy script, the result is a legitimate B movie, in the worst sense of the term."
" Still love it
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,9,"Maybe it's because I absolutely love the first movie and this one is just coming under the first one's steam, but I thought it was very entertaining, if a bit repetitive. That's why 9 stars instead of 10. But the average of 5 stars is ridiculous. Probably because it underperformed for some people's expectations - vindictive rating. It's definitely above 7... objectively."
" Why all the negativity?
",2021-04-06 00:00:00,8,"OK, so this film is not as good as the first, but then not many sequels actually are, but I did really enjoy this.It's cheesy as hell, predictable, full of cliché's, one liners (from the original film) and leans very heavy on the legacy of the original... But why not, it's the sequel!I wish people will stop taking films so seriously. If you want something serious and real, go watch David Attenborough Blue Planet or something. You want to lose yourself in some fantasy Sci-Fi that pushes the elements of reality to the boundaries and often beyond... Then watch Hollywood!The baseline of the film is good, the story line works, the acting isn't the best, but still works. In my opinion, grab a soft drink and bag of Popcorn, sit back and enjoy. It's meant to be entertainment and I thought this film was exactly that. If you enjoy an entertaining Sci-Fi action film, then is will be enjoyable for you. Fast paced, lots going... and there is an opening for a Third!!! Fingers crossed!"
" Should have paid Will!
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,1,Maybe if they paid Will Smith it would have been better? Recasting Patricia Whitmore was also a big mistake I feel. Then the story line itself just was poorly done. Could have been such a great movie!! Such a shame!
" Avoid - Absolute rubbish
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,2,"I can't believe how bad this film is, forget B movie, this is a C movie.So much going on that you can't keep up with story. When I caught up I was wishing I hadn't.Acting is atrocious and story is beyond belief.The story and acting are actually embarrassing.I wish I had spent the time watching grass grow."
" Terrible writing. Hardly feels related to 1st film.
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,1,"This film kept reminding me of all the recent SCI-FI/ Alien films. It seems regurgitated, cliche, hollywood trash. Pick any sci-fi movie from last 10 years prior to this (2016).
Prometheus, Pacific Ring, Alien Covenant...etc...
The characters seem cliche. The writers: Devlin, Emmerich, James A. Woods, Vanderbilt...they all share blame! The visual effects/ concept artists also share blame for the cliche look/vibe. The opening credits were right out of Pacific Ring, I was thinking thered be a voice over talking about a portal deep withing the earth..."
" Liam Hemsworth
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,3,Could one person tell me what he brings to cinema?is t acting ability? Is it good looks? is it a vision? is it a command of the English language? I see none of that so someone explain to me.
" The one thing I liked
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,3,"This features the robots from Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy. Totally.
Wait for it!"
" Some actors do okey
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,3,"This, as a A- action movie is maybe okey. It is obviously an American movie where the ""humans"" still don't learn a thing. And (referring to other alien movies, maybe like Avengers Ultron) the human race lack creativity in making new tech/weapons/armor/intelligence etc. Aircraft scenes are like anyone ""o o o please pull up"". Inside enemy's ""aircraft"" they suddenly have a ""Vietnam war/fighting in water and high grass"". The one monster inside after prox 1 hour and 18 minute with 3 heads obviously looks like a hydra, other aliens obviously looks like old alien movies. So... storyline is pretty slim, quite predictable, sound is just high sound, but..: as an easygoing entertainment, some cute actors (male/female), and a couple old actors (the best(that nobody listen to/even if they saved the world last time) but the old ones is good character same as a couple new promising new actors) it is okey. As an WOW earth is going under movie it is just okey."
" Nice...nice
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,7,I for one actually liked it and thought it was a great teaser for a potential 3rd installment. I also think will smith is a horrible actor and didnt miss his absence.
" Almost as fun as the first.
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,7,"Lots of characters from the original, lots of throw backs, big action sequences, rousing speeches, people making heroic sacrifices. It doesn't have so many punchy one liners, and Hemsworth and Usher were no replacement for Will Smith, but it was still a great ride. Wish I'd watched it sooner."
" Waste Of Space!
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,2,"If you have come across any of my other reviews regarding sequels or reboots you will know my number one concern is that if they are going to do it, don't ruin the legacy.
IDR unfortunately does just that. This is a horrible piece of crap that should have never been made. CONGRATULATIONS TO THE MAKERS OF ET FOR NEVER HAVING MADE A SEQUEL!!!!!I simply consider this film to not exist.Another good rule for a sequel, if you can't get the band back together then don't do it!"
" A disgrace to the original
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,1,"Terrible acting, weak characters, and a VERY weak plot.As a huge fan of the original, I feel personally offended by this movie. Save your time and watch something else."
" Made in China
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,2,"Obvious infusion of Chinese capital, with Chinese quality in return: when you initially think it was cheap, but you later realize you got crap back..."
" 90 million dollars MORE than the first great film??
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,1,"Good thing Will Smith backed away from this awful project. Not worth the money, the time, the effort. I tried to watch it for maybe 15 or 20 minutes, on TV and was
very relieved that I didn't waste money on a movie ticket (as I continue to kick myself for not getting to the theater for BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY) but I digress. The only thing that got me here to write this pitiful review, is that the first INDEPENDENCE DAY, just happens to be on SHOWTIME. I do however, have more than one copy of the first film, on DVD, BLU RAY, etc. Best line ever from the very much underrated actress, Margaret Colin, ""And don't touch anything!""
And I swear, the whole cast has chemistry in that one movie, should have stood alone! As they interact, cross paths, get involved, to finally put their heads together and save the world from aliens, from ""outer space"". Too bad that has to be strongly verified these days. The 1996, now classic INDEPENDENCE DAY feels like the good old days, before it was added to the long list of films that we couldn't watch for awhile, after the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks changed our lives forever.
Now in the year 2021, as we battle a world wide pandemic, all the frightening movies are suddenly coming true.
This film should never have been made. Even the unfortunate Randy Quaid, who pretty much found the final answer to save the world with the loss of his own life, suffers with staying sane these days.
To paraphrase Bill Pullman as the president, ""A lot of people died today. (In our reality, the last year.) How many didn't have to?""
A lot of money was put into this sequel. What else could it have been used for??
relieved"
" Go woke...
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,2,"Perfect movie for this generation, every diversity you didn't know you need.
African-american hero check. Let's make him best-friend with a male alpha just like every buddy movie in the 90s, don't mind with the ""no chemistry between these so-call friends at all"" problem.
Homosexual hero check. Let's make him find his old lover back and even die in his arms, don't mind with the ""how come he walks fine immediately after all these years in a coma"" problem.
Asian woman hero check. Let's make her a pilot of super-advanced spaceshift, don't mind with the ""but she looks 20!"" problem, all Asians are gifted anyway.
African hero check. Let's make him fight aliens with machetes, don't mind with the above mentioned super gifted Asian woman, he's a man, nobody cares.
Jewish hero check. Let's have Jeff Goldblum and his dad come back, don't mind with the ""he saves children by driving them in a bus and is not crushed nor lasered by a gigantic alien"" problem.
Other old hero from the 1st movie check. Let's have the President, everybody liked him, let's have the stripper who thanks to being the wife of a hero got medical classes, etc etc.
Let's mix all this with an indecent amount of CGI & SFX, and surely you'll have an amazing movie that'll have the same combo of patriotism and silliness and effectiveness than 20 years ago right?
Well, no."
" Awesome.
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,10,I'm really hiped after watching this.I really loved watch it and wanna another film :)
" Not a good sequel
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,2,"I was looking forward to seeing the movie but it was slow boring and uninspiring, the original was way better, it took them 20 years and this is the best they could up with, so disappointed"
" Aawful!
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,1,The first was stupid but this is awful. What could of been worse. Trump willing the election?
" Full of ridiculous things
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,2,"Especially Jake honoring/avenging his parents by showing a middle finger to aliens and then pissing on the floor of their planet size ship. While holding both hands behind his head.
And that is just the beginning or rather the end of it.
Numerous and disguisting pandering to the Chinese, crazy doctor running around like a headless and pantless chochickenjust after 25 years in a coma and so o.n."
" Just Awful
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,2,Absolute trash. The only reason I give it two stars is I found myself laughing throughout (at how bad it was)!
" Worst film ever?
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,1,Did anyone in this film manage to have a career after it? So bad I cringed on behalf of the actors.
" Dissapointment Day
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,3,There are so many things about this film that i hate. Samples:Great graphics in the first movie and here too but they alone do not entertain without believable content.An entire city is destroyed and the planet is threatened yet the so called heroes showed no signs of grieve whatsoever.That talking white ball is too convenient.
" Total Garbage
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,3,This is all haurplugs and green screen with voiceover. Terrible pablum.
" Main Character Arc Missing
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,5,"Aliens from previous Independence Day attack Earth again; original cast is there plus adult children who've joined in the fight. Most characters have the same screen time, which means we don't have a single character arc that's more developed than the rest. This makes the story seem flat."
" I tried really hard to like this movie
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,1,I tried really hard to like this movie. I couldn't find anything worth getting excited about. Even the special effects weren't that great in my opinion. The effects and models from 20 years ago were far superior.
" Painfully bad
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,2,Cliche after cliche after cliche. I don't think I've ever seen such a expensive excuse for a movie.
" We seriously waited 20 years for THIS?!
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,3,"For 20 years, people have been demanding to get a film that would be as big as Independence Day that would be just as fun as the predecessor. Somehow, though, the sequel found a way to COMPLETELY mess it up.Independence Day: Resurgence is a disgrace to both its franchise, Roland Emmerich's career, and the ENTIRE sci-fi genre. While it may benefit from decent visual effects, that CANNOT save itself from the obvious lack of direction and horrible writing that delivers a bland and unoriginal story, a despicable tone, generic characters, and stale action scenes that don't fix anything. But thanks to a twist about a bigger universe that actually makes its problems much worse, this ends up DESTROYING what's left of the picture. If I gotta be honest, just don't bother with this one. Watch the fireworks instead or just stick with the original. But this film is not just soulless and corproate, but also a shining sign of how not EVERYTHING deserves a sequel."
" Just a payday for Jeff and Bill
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,1,An awful sequel which lacked any sense of originality or imagination. Essentially a rehash of the original with even bigger badder aliens. All the key characters have been resurrected with drab dialogue that often references the first script. Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum must have needed the work. Will Smith was smart enough to stay away from this one. So should you.
" Nothing wrong with Chinese actors
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,6,"It's not as good as the first one, but it's still a fast 2 hours to pass by. Nothing wrong with using Chinese actors(actually Chin is from singapore and Baby is from hong kong with a German grandpa), it's the story that was wrong written, dont blame everything on China like Donald Trump."
" A profanation of the original
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,2,"The first Independence Day is a classic to me. It was the perfect sci-fi action movie of the 90s: heroism (even if obviously it was the typical ""America is the best"" product), funny touches and a well built story. Independence Day 2 crushed all my expectations.... it's got nothing to make it interesting, none of the first ones wit or charm and the characters are void and plain. Nothing happens really.... aliens come back, they are bad, we kill them. No wonder it was a disaster and the 3rd one never happened."
" Why is this allowed ?
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,1,"90% of characters are useless
the scenario is even further than the moonI lost my time.
I think the worst are the pathetic references to the first film of '96 when we see different peoples around the globe gathering around the radio to listen to the American discourse.Anyway, it started very badly when the American president decided to shoot allied aliens when out of 12 members of the staff 2 were for an attack and 2 against. Who cares about the others? ....
This movie is clearly crap in a can"
" Movie is both solid and bad
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,7,"The movie action scene are good, the dogfight is so cool, the ufo ship is very good in detail, but the movie lack will smith which is bad and sad, this movie should have will smith in it
Sadly will stepped down but atleast the sequel is good, but other bad thing is that actor acting performance is not good enough, but i think this movie deserve better review and be given another chances"
" 2 stars for the visual effects
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,2,"There is nothing remarkable about this film. Don't waste your time. The only interesting part is the CGI, which in my opinion is mostly fine.The acting was bad, there plot is predictable and poorly put together, and the soundtracks were forgettable."
" If Only It Was Supposed to be a Comedy
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,3,"If only, it would have got a so much higher score for me. It would a least have been a spoof of the original. As it is the story is so close to the first that you can't think any more than it was a sucker movie to make money. They sucker people to pay and then laugh all the way to the bank. The writer certainly had the cliche handbook when composing this comedy opus.
I really can't wait for the next one in the series where the corpses of the original actors are re-animated for the spectacle.
My advise is get drunk with a load of mates and laugh your faces right off.
Lines like ""Command we have a visual"". They are 10 miles from a craft 3000 miles across. Legally blind people could have seen it sooner. This movie is basically fraud. They conned people out of money. The people behind it are criminals."
" The Advantage Chinese Women Have Over American Women...
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,4,"Is that they are thinner, have better longer hair and are not tattooed trash.
But when a sequel is this bad and boring and no women show skin and evoke any type of manly feeling in men then one has to ask 'what is the point?'
The story is nonsense."
" So bad...
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,3,"I really love the original, and was so looking forward to this one. Now I wish I could un-watch it. It's poorly paced, poorly acted, and just uninteresting. The only good thing is that, since it's been a while since I watched it, the memory is starting to fade."
" Hosed up
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,2,"Sequels are rarely as good as the original and this movie is definitely no exception. I blame the script writers for this disaster, because the actors were only doing their jobs. If they decide to make another sequel, then I can only hope they do not hose it up even worse."
" Waste of time
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,1,"After hesitation I watched it .
Waste of time and bad acting , pointless sequel."
" Visuality ""cgi"" as a starting point so get something out of this.
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,6,"The original is awesome. Let's start with that. Visually visible and the story is quite cliché with drama, but this film should be viewed from a visual point of view, then maybe it will work. I actually watched the 2k HDR version. Impressive looking, but the drama's effectiveness didn't work. And while visuals are at the center, the big boots weren't filled.Nice entertainment as long as the popcorn is ready and the brain in the cloakroom."
" I can't tell
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,3,"If this film had more Chinese junk products placed in it or Wal-mart.It is hard to tell.Anyway, maybe this film is better than Wal-Mart. it had a couple of thin women in it."
" How do you say 'buzz off' in Chinese?
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,2,Bad movieIndie Day was a joke. Director needs to decide whether it is a comedy or action movie. At least let a couple of the women show skin and flaunt their feminine form.
" Child's play
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,1,Just took me back to 1996 where as a kid I would have enjoyed this movie but nothing of today. Instead would add that the 1996 prequal was way better. This one is not good with its grapic quality either looks low budget.
" That was quite crappy
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,2,"I give more than 1 star because the dog made it through the movie. What an insult to the first part. ""jasmine, neighbours are movin' out"". No wonder will didn't sign up for this crap."
" Independence Day Divergent
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,3,"Just a heads up, I've never watched Divergent, so don't take this as a crapping on Divergent. Based on what I've seen from trailers though this has a similar bland futuristic aesthetic and is similarly a YA (young adult) Sci-Fi.Anthony Mackie lamented at a press briefing that we now make movies for ""16 year olds and China"". Exhibit A for the Court: Independence Day: Resurgence.Independence Day (1996) is by no means a smart film. In fact it's very dumb. As dumb as it's sequel is, it's honestly not much dumber, maybe even a bit smarter in parts, but it has something this lacks: adults. The actors, to be clear are adults. I'm sure Liam Hemsworth and Jessie Usher are not much younger than Will Smith in 1996, but there are many key differences. Will Smith's character has a partner and children. He has a home, and he's worried about his image in the community. Jeff Goldblum has already divorced, and taken a middle class job. Bill Pullman's President was one of the main characters.In this? It follows mainly children. We have a President is Sela Ward, but instead of her rallying the troops it's the baby faced Jessie Usher. This has become a sad trend in movies as of late. There are no more adults to ground things. The relationships, like the one between Hemsworth and Maika Monroe feels more comfortable in an episode of Saved By the Bell than something serious adults would engage in.The script is omniscient. In the first film the aliens' objective is a mystery, and here, everyone knows everything. The Aliens are OP, but the stakes feel lower. The simplicity of the dialogue to make it easy to translate and export is excruciating. While the original is dumb, the confusion we share with the film's protagonists of the what's, how's and why's, make it seem like Shakespearean brilliance compared to this boring mess.True, this film introduces many interesting concepts such as a ship so large it has its own gravitational pull, the fact that a alien invasion actually resulted in a pan-global utopia, and hints that they have been doing this to other planets, but none of this is explored and thrust aside for the second act remake of the first.The destruction in this is very intriguing however it's far to brief. The original took its time and dwelled on it, even showing them moving on to other cities. It showed the diaspora on refugees fleeing the wreckage of our major cities. In this you feel nothing. It happens - Washington gets destroyed AGAIN - except the White House this time - but it's over in a flash.The film is a textbook example of how bad cinema is now. The adults in this film are all callback characters. The grandpas of the adult. The young actors all play arrested development kids. Like Anthony said, 16 year olds and China."
" Made with same spirit as the first.
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,7,"If you liked the first movie, then I think this would entertain you as well. Made with with the same corny 90s style as the first one. And with the same humour. Happy to see Brent Spiners character getting some more time on screen in this sequel."

" High Mark's for cgi and great 3d only!!
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,8,"Jeff goldblum is always amazing even with a crap script like this Liam's Hemsworth is just ok hes no chris and the rest of the cast is just ok. Will Smith was missed should have paid him his 25 million that he asked for and your studio said 2much!! He really made the 1st one this one gets high Mark's from me for the great cgi ,special effects and a great 3d bluray I actually like ete candy, wish it would have had a decent script could have killed it. Oh well I'll watch the special effects and 3d and ignore the story."
" A lazy, brazen cash-cow with no effort to produce a decent moviegoing experience
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,2,"It seemed like a stretch of credulity that 20 years later Independence Day: Resurgence could live up to the success of its original. There's been so many imitators and huge evolutions in SFX technology since their brand of alien made a flambé of our planet's cities, that nostalgia was not going to suffice. But Emmerich could have at least tried. I've never seen such a lazy, half-assed brazen cash-cow of a sequel in a long time. The script literally made no sense, even for Sci-fi, but no one seems to care. The cast of pretty accomplished actors couldn't give too hoots about convincing performances (perhaps more concerned with how to spend their pay checks). This is all about the money, for the movie makers, for the marketers, for the studio. No care is given to the moviegoer. Hollywood as its most audaciously awful."
" Great special effects, but disappointing story, a commercial movie just to attract people over nostalgia
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,4,"The title of my review say it all: there is nothing wrong in creating such commercial movies, but at least try to do something decent. You have big budgets to create amazing special effects, but not to write a decent story with interesting characters? I was not expecting a masterpiece considering the genre, but not even this garbage: nonsensical story lines, that are there just to hit the 2 hours marker, people every time that fire scream, which is very annoying, characters that can survive for a miracle. Let's put in the mix a little bit of romance, the classic American patriotism and actors of every possible race, even if they are useless and they basically do nothing, just to be politically correct. I am happy that Hollywood became open minded, but please don't put an asian or an afro-american actor just for the sake of it. Instead try to give him/her an interesting role.Very disappointed overall, as Independence Day is part of my teenage years and I was really expecting a lot from it. I suppose that they will make a sequel, considering what happened in the end. Let's just hope that they will make something interesting."
" The prequel and sequel to this sound more interesting
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,3,"Yep, this was boring, like reaaaaallly boring. The most interesting part for me was the story about how the African triodes hunted them. That sounded like a movie I want to watch.
And the sequel they set up should sound familiar to any anime fans, it's pretty much the set up for Robotech 2!
On the plus side, I gave this movie an extra star for having Jeff Goldblum"
" Not as bad as most people say. It depends on how high your expectations are.
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,7,"This sequel to the 1996 alien invasion film is admittedly full of problems, but I actually enjoyed it. Keep in mind the original ID4 was far from original itself, being essentially a big budget modern remake of War of the Worlds, full of cheesy one-liners, big boisterous special effects, and cringe-worthy acting, but it was fun nevertheless. This time around, the fight is decidedly less one sided, as humanity has reverse engineered the alien technology to use as defense. Also, the special effects didn't quite knock my socks off as much as the original, as I saw the first film when it first came out when I was in high school. But it was still entertaining. The film is definitely watchable, even without Will Smith. Plus, it set it up for a 3rd film, which will feature us going to attack them, with the help of other races. That might be neat to see. Overall, not must see by any means, but ok."

",2020-07-17 00:00:00,3,"Resurgence does have mostly good effects, some okay performances (Liam Hemsworth, Bill Pullman, and Jeff goldblum), and some action that's okay. But it's ruined by other acting that ranges from meh (Brent spiner and William fichtner) to terrible (Jesse t. Usher and Travis rope), a boring and predictable story, an awful sequel bate ending, characters that you don't really care about, some dumb plot holes, and Confusing jokes. Just a boring, bland watch."

" Not worth watching
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,5,First movie is fun and entertaining. This one is just boring and not engaging at all.
" Purile Tripe
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,1,"Earth is being invaded (again). The action cuts every few seconds between different locations so fast you don't know where you are half the time, they include Area 51, somewhere in Africa, Salt Lake, Washington, down a bunker, some big city that's being destroyed, the Moon, the control room of a ship somewhere, a prison for aliens, in a jungle inside the alien spaceship - usually with some kind of disaster going on.Seems the last invasion has united Earth into One World, albeit adopting American culture complete with politically correct operatics and speeches to brass-band music.The characters create zero empathy with the viewer. Everyone except Goldblum is over-acting like crazy. The pilots fly their space fighter craft with cowboy whoopees, and Brent Spiner, trying to act a nutty professor, comes over like Coco the Clown without the make-up. There is a feud between two of the pilots (I didn't catch why) and they are still yapping about it over the radio in the middle of dogfights with the aliens. There are some side-plot love stories that interrupt the height of the action but fail to create interest. The stupidity of some of the characters' actions is beyond belief.Towards the end, two idiot characters drive a school bus load of kids into the middle of the area set out for the showdown battle. Instead getting out as fast, they drive up to the feet of the gigantic Alien monster, apparently out of curiosity, and turn off the engine. The monster, which until then had been aiming to conquer the Universe, is now diverted into trying to squish a bus. It's ridiculous, but the kids on the bus are a clue about what age group this trash might appeal to.The only thing to do with this film is to ignore the plot and try to appreciate the technicalities of the CGI, which is almost non-stop - to the point of boredom."
" A very dumb and inferior sequel
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,2,"I enjoyed ""Independence Day (1996)"" even if the movie itself was dumb and silly because, in the end, it was incredibly fun. I was honestly surprised to hear the movie get a sequel 20 years later but the trailers never really pulled me in and all the bad reviews deterred me from giving it a watch myself. Plus Will Smith was not returning due to scheduling conflict with Suicide Squad and they decided to have his character killed off-screen which is annoying. Still, Roland Emmerich who directed the first one was returning for the sequel so it had potential to be good. Anyway since it is independence day I've decided to give the movie a chance and see for myself if the movie was as bad as people say it was.The premise of the movie is that 20 years after the alien invasion, nations across the world started to use recovered extraterrestrial technology to develop an immense defence program. When the alien invaders return and attack with unprecedented force, the U.S. president, teams of scientists and brave fighter pilots spring into action to save the planet from a seemingly invincible enemy.Firstly, I want to praise the concept and idea of this movie. The humans using alien technology and preparing for the next alien invasion is an interesting idea. Shame they don't do much with it but oh well. The destruction in the first act of the movie is cool though and the CGI, in general, is visually impressive.Secondly, I've got to praise the returning actors' Jeff Goldblum, Brent Spiner and Bill Pullman who return as their respective characters from the first movie. Both Jeff, Brent and Bill still give great, charismatic performances despite the really poor script. Experience and veteran actors like Sela Ward as the new president and William Fichtner as space commander are also really good in the film. Liam Hemsworth as ""Jake Morrison"" is one of the few genuinely good new and young actors and is also able to give a somewhat good performance with the bad script.That is all the praise I can give this movie because it is bad and not a good sequel. On the topic of new actors, Jessie Usher as ""Dylan Hiller"" stepson of ""Steven Hiller"", Will Smith's character from the first movie, is terrible. Jessie has no charm or any of the emotional range of Steven Hiller. He never gives any quips like Steven and the moments that are meant to be emotional are not there because Jessie fails to deliver a good performance. It may not necessarily be his fault as the script is atrocious but his character doesn't live up to his father. There is also this Chinese actress Angela Yeung Wing as ""Rain Lao"" who is quite bad as well as she gives a boring performance but then again her character is just written to be a good looking person in the battle. Another reason why this script is really poor. The other new actors do a somewhat decent job but none of them really stand out.I've already mentioned a dozen times but the script is just dumb. A fair amount of lines spouted out by the actors just feel like it was written by a 10-year-old and are not even amusing or funny. A lot of dialogue feel utterly meaningless and add nothing to the movie. One of the charms about the original movie was the quips of Will Smith which even though it was cheesy, it was able to give me a small chuckle. In this movie, it feels like they are trying really hard to get us to laugh with over the top cartooney performance and dumb written dialogue. Unfortunately, it doesn't work and it makes this movie almost a pain to get through.The story in the first movie was dumb and despite the interesting idea in this movie, it is still pretty dumb. Just like the first movie, you are going to have to shut your logic brain because a lot of moments in this movie require you to just believe that can happen. However, the third act in this movie is even more unconvincing and more stupid than the first movie and makes me genuinely believe the aliens are stupid. It also retreads a lot of similar ground to the first movie with destruction first act then attempted but failed mission second act and unconvincing plan but successful third act. It's just the same plot and concept of the first movie but given a new coat of paint and that is lazy.Additionally, the action scenes in this movie are just not as entertaining as the first one. There is a dogfight similar to the first movie but in this case, it is just a cluster of grey CGI spaceships shooting laser beams all over the place with no idea who the good guys and bad guys are. It's just boring and uninspiring. The final fight is also just not that epic and had a lot of incredibly stupid moments.This is a very unsatisfying sequel and is inferior to the first movie in everywhere. Independence day 1996 was dumb but unique and was a really fun experience. However, Independence Day Resurgence is just dumb in general. The movie also has the nerve and audacity to tease a sequel at the end and honestly with its poor box office performance, I am glad that it will never happen. The first movie made an alien invasion exciting, Resurgence makes it forgettable and boring."
" Absolutely appalling on every level.
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,1,"The original movie, let's be honest, was far from great, but it was well done, built intrigue and suspense in it's first hour as the aliens arrived on earth and was a visually groundbreaking film that had some iconic imagery in it, and was ultimately fun and entertaining for what it was.This steaming pile has absolutely NONE of those qualities.This really has to be one of the very worst films I've ever seen, characters are introduced with zero back story or development and immediately begin running around shouting atrocious, cringe inducing dialogue. Scenes are just thrown at the camera with people yelling through an absolute onslaught of computer graphics with little to no coherence, stakes or anything remotely resembling entertainment. Actors from the first movie return and even most of these stink the place out, even the likes of Jeff goldblum and Brent spiner - and it hurts to write that.The only passable scene in this 165 million dollar turd is where the main alien ship lands on earth and destroys half the Eastern seaboard but even this was laughably dumb and largely ripped off one Emmerich's earlier films, 2012.This film makes even the worst transformers films look good it really is THAT bad. I was genuinely shocked at how poor it is. Avoid."
" Would pass for a Netflix Original
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,4,"I waited for this movie for 20 years. The original Independence Day is my all time favourite movie.
When I left the cinema after viewing this I was so disappointed I tweeted Emmerich to simply ask why this movie was made.
So disapointed, not even the brilliant Goldblum could save this.To make things worse, Brexit happened the day I saw this movie.Wish the war of 96 went the way of the invaders nowPS. Don't shoot that green s*** at me, or waste time on this movie. Just watch the first one, twice!"

",2020-06-26 00:00:00,10,"I loved the movie and all the cast! Great acting! I was disappointed that they didn't bring Constance Spano character back and was said because of her age, and l thought that was crap since based on her picture which was up to date that for her age she looked great and Jeff was older than her. A little double standards to me. I had nothing against the actress that played the new woman in his life. Just they didn't have to say her age if they were just wanting to use a different story line. I hate. They killed off Dillions mom. I have to say over all l enjoyed it and have watched it alot of times. I always buy the DVD/ Blue Ray of l really enjoyed the movie, just don't understand why other people have low score on a great movie."

" Not as bad as the several negative ratings
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,10,"It's entertaining and has better CGI than the part one. The acting is not so bad. I believe they could've thrown in an extra 15 to 30mins to build on the characters and story. This movie deserves more credit compared to all the negative reviews. And, its better than the Disney star wars trilogy and still intune with its original story. I do not know why people have to always compare movies with star wars. But I'm forced to due to one of the reviews."
" About the same as the original, merely OK
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,6,"After finally sitting down and watching Independence Day: Resurgence for myself I'm a bit befuddled why it was so reviled. I'll admit that the new young actors are no match for the charisma of Will Smith, and this film could have used a big presence like that in order to liven it up a bit. I also can see that the landmarks that are destroyed in this film are a bit less iconic, considering one of the big selling points of the original was images of the Empire State Building, the White House, and other legendary buildings exploding. However, I think there is a large contingent of people who have fond memories of Independence Day from when they were younger, that have elevated that movie into some kind of legendary status, so this sequel couldn't live up to that standard. What they failed to realize is that the original isn't that good, and this sequel is on par with it in terms of quality. Both of the ID movies are big, loud monster movies with a cast of ridiculous characters trying to work together to survive and save the Earth.Resurgence is an utterly ludicrous movie that takes some of the insanity of the first film and cranks it up to the extreme. I found it kind of funny that, in many ways, they just went bigger with everything so that the aliens would still be a threat even though the humans had some alien weaponry this time. Some of the characters are fun to watch. In particular, it's always enjoyable to see Jeff Goldblum running around. There are some lesser characters that no one cares about, just like in the first film. In this case, Judd Hirsch is almost unwatchable and should have been cut from the story. The CGI is solid, and I think they did a good job making some fully animated aliens so we could see them walking around unlike the first film where they tried to go primarily practical and at times they looked like Muppets. There were some fun moments, and also parts where the movie slowed down and bored me. I didn't love Independence Day: Resurgence, but I thought it was a worthy successor to the equally mediocre original."
" Love this Sequel
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,10,Great sequel for ID4 Hope the Part 2 soon! Great action and technology update!
" Doesn't have as much as fun as the original
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,6,"The original Independence Day (1996) was a whole lot of fun, especially Will Smith. This did not live up to the original. This time the actors and characters were rather generic, and nobody had the charm that Will Smith brought to the original. The storyline was a bit interesting in how it expanded the fictional world, but it left a lot of this for future sequels that we probably won't see."
" As idiotic as the original
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,1,"No wait, it's actually much worse because this is 2016 and the ""guilty pleasure"" excuse doesn't work anymore, not for such piece of garbage. It's clear within 5 mins where this is headed. Nowhere. Every single scene is annoying. The script a catastrophe. The acting... Don't get me started. Do yourself a favor and skip this rubbish."
" Honestly Hollywood, you should've done this sequel better or just don't do it at all.....
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,2,"Instead of making tons of reasons why this movie had it's ups and down in my personal opinion, ill make a pro and con list with short sentences:-Pros
*Jeff Goldblum
*CGI was absolutely fantastic
*Some characters were likeable (like Judd Hirsch playing Goldblums dad)Cons:
*No Will Smith
*Storyline was too mediocre like it felt too much of Star Wars than Independence Day
* 20 years too late for Hollywood to be butchering a well received classic. They don't know when to leave originals alone like f them totally if they are going make a mockery of forgetting about a original years later...."
" A good thriller from start to finish.
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,8,"If you don't mind the good ole US coming again to the rescue of the planet, there's room for a third one, now with humanity; Chinese, Arabs and Africans on tow, leading the way to an intergalactic extermination of the ""Harvester Hives""; with all the rest of inlelligent species coming along for the ride. Might make a good small screen series for lovers of not too scientific SciFi. Likable cast and decent direction.Leaves a lot of material for some good episodes. Looking for one to include Bill Fitchner, Brent Spinner, Joey King, and why not, Jeff Goldblum.Must be the quarantine boredom but I found it a solid 8 in the genre."

" Writing this review as I'm watching it
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,3,"Unfortunately as hyped as I was for this movie, it's a plate of hot garbage. It's so bad, I decided to write this review while I'm in the process of watching it.

I'm using President Whitmore's word....this movie must face ""Annihilation."""
" Independence Day : Resurgence (2016) - If you loved the first... This one quite tries to come out okay.

It's Independence Day sequel for me and I kinda waited for it for a long time.I know they had two decades for this but still loved it though.Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman and Judd Hirsch playing their roles was an amazing experience.The stunning action sequences are typical Roland Emmerich and his love of destructing global landmarks is amazing. (White House Down (2013), 2012 (2009), The day after tomorrow(2004) and Godzilla (1998))A personal favourite.Overall - 3.5/5"
" GREAT FILM
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,8,"I remember Independence Day (1996) with great nostalgia when my father played it for the first time in the VHS. It truly let a great impression in my young mind (I was 6 years old then), and even today (23 years later), I am still captivated by such experience.Roland Emmerich and his talented team made a blockbuster success, not only in terms of moral and cultural enrichment, but in the fields of innovation. These ingenious technical solutions (practical effects, pyrotechnics, scale models, specific landscapes...) played an important role when applied to solve the many unexpected drawbacks to make this particular story a reality. Especially the organic alien designs by Patrick Tatopoulos, and the massive scale of the global situations. The final result is a contemporary Epic depicting cataclysmic events, the clash of two worlds, where our Heroes (hard working people from the society) defend their right to live at the face of the reckoning day. Legendary!Since then, the idea for a sequel regarding this franchise never came to fruition in my mind. The original felt like a standalone film! Nevertheless, when I heard 20 years later about the factual project, I got excited. Even more when the first trailer was released, and once again we hear in the background that memorable speech from Mister President Thomas Whitmore calling a new generation to serve in honor and duty.Unfortunately, ID4-R did not top the shadow of its predecessor. Basically, the main problem was the formula. The new addition to the franchise should have focus completely on tragedy. A theme opposed to The War of 1996, where there was hope and human victory at the end. Independence Day - Resurgence (2016) could have been a unique piece, unforgettable while reaching new grounds. This would have been accomplished by following the Super Bowl TV Commercial trailer spirit. If the aliens were going to make a second coming to mother Earth, the creators should have had the task of presenting them surrounded by heavy feelings of inescapable damnation (existential threat for the human civilization), while implementing an apocalyptical ending (and yet, behind the fumes of ashes: we could have found a little flower of hope); this with the purpose of engaging the audience for the third installment (which till date is not going to happen due to its box office failure).Therefore, finding myself as a huge hardcore fanatic, I decided to fix the sequel into something closer to my vision. By taking out all the ridiculous paraphernalia, I gave a more grounded essence to my fan edition. Finally, I found peace and plenitude in my quest. I only hope everyone enjoy it as much as I do because I did it for love!

" We haven´t learned a bit, the aliens haven´t either
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,1,"For years I was hopeful that the original Independence day would get a sequel. Now, for years I am regretting that it ever did.Overall, it is a dumb movie, made for dumb people. While this sounds like an insult, it is not. The sheer fact that this film tanked at the box office and earned way less than the original means, that humanity has evolved and requires so much more from movies than what was given to us in this film.The reasons why this film has not lived to its expectation are many. Bad actors, performing poorly is for sure one. But even the best actors would most likely not be able to save the poor script based on which this movie was filmed.One of the things which kill it, is that the sequel does not move a bit further from its original and builds on the same basics. Earth is unaware that a ship the size of the moon is approaching until it is in your backyard. It lands on earth, with the terran defenses unable to make a dent into it, so they try the same stupid tactics of sending squadrons of fighters which are one by one shot down by the alien fighters. Bomber pilots are unable to destroy the mothership, as the nuclear bombs can not be detonated by them but must be triggered from earth. In the middle of all of this a mom with a newborn baby is rescued from a skyscraper while the mom of one of the fighter pilots falls to certain death. (we knew this would happen the moment the camera cut to the scene).Earth is yet again at the brink of total destruction, as aliens dig a hole to the earths core. The only hope left is a heroic pilot and a mad scientist. Yes, yet again.In a unexpected twist (blink blink) the scientist with the help of a friendly alien intelligence comes up with a plan, while the pilot flies around in a stolen alien craft at his will. Obviously, the alien queen, instead of sending her massive armies to destroy the alien intelligence or continuing to drill for the core, leaves the safety of the mother ship and goes on a personal vendetta mission, only to attack a school bus full of kids. With a queen this stupid, its only a matter of time until the heroic pilot kills her after some physics and logic defying moves.Earth is saved, and so is the rest of the brain cells of the viewers. With a bit of luck, this horrible movie will end the Independence day series, or at least postpones the next sequel until a time, where script writers catch up with the intelligence of the audience."

" Jeff Goldblum good Will Smith bad 👍😁
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,7,"Ya i didnt think the movie was as good as the first but it was alright. The first one was a new idea 20 yrs ago and yes many more movies have followed same idea. But lets get 1 thing straight, will smith wouldnt have made any fifference in this movie and the only reasin he didnt was money. He thinks he is worth way more than he is. I liked will smith until his kids came out and many other stars have had kids that are no where near as arrogant or entitled.Anytime you go into anything with preconceived ideas it could be trouble. The movie was good in its own right. Just have some popcorn and enjoy."

So I quite understand people in theaters. But from the first Alien's attack movie gets better and better with each second. Not as epic as the first movie, but not as bad as critics yell. Acting? Get out of here! There is no time for this! Science flaws? Who knows? Anything is possible in the Future. Don't try to bring your primitive modern day science to undiscovered country of tomorrow. I liked the ride. Strong 6 out of 10 here, but I give 10, beause I'm that type of guy."

When you break this one down, the action and special effects, were better than the original.
I agree WS should have come back to play, but hey, there are some good young actors that can take the original cast to the final battle.
Hopefully someone from the studios actually reads these thoughts.

",2020-02-01 00:00:00,6,It needs to build up to a great franchise not make it worse the special effects were good even the casting too but the plot is weak even the script is cheesy the movie had some flaws to begin with even it try to be a franchise after the cliffhanger ending it try to be like Star Wars it perspective things about but the main thing is fix it right
" Garbage
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,5,I think they spent 20 minutes writing this script. You think with a 20 year gap they could have came up with a more realistic plot. Evening the acting was bad.
" Not bad, good special effects.
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,6,"I had avoided watching this because of all the bad reviews. Turns out it wasn't that bad. I loved the original movie and while this one didn't have the same magic, it was OK. The special effects were very good and it was fun to see some of the original characters, especially Brent Spinner playing the crazy scientist. The acting by the new characters ranged from OK to ""are you really an actor?"" Resurgence is a good movie for a lazy afternoon."
" Moderately amusing, at best.
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,5,"The original over the top 1990s sci-fi / action blockbuster got itself this routinely (and ineptly) written sequel that purports to show us how the human race finally learned to get along after uniting against an extraterrestrial menace. Moreover, we've benefited from learning about their weapons and technology. The catch, of course, is that they've also had 20 years to prepare for another attack on us. A number of holdovers from the first movie - or their offspring - band together to launch a major offensive. They also get some help from an unexpected source.The bottom line is that if you HATED the first film, you'd probably loathe this follow-up even more. It has the same dumb, sappy character writing and laughably bad introductory sequences. Some of the scenes are just cringe-inducing, for example the ones with a resurrected Dr. Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner) as he fumbles about with a laser he invented and otherwise acts like a goofball. The Will Smith hero is replaced with his now grown-up son, Dylan (Jessie T. Usher), but other protagonists like ex-President Whitmore (Bill Pullman) make encore appearances.The sense of scale and the visual effects are pretty darn impressive - at least, as far as CGI goes, and director Roland Emmerich and company offer plenty of action. It's just hard to care all that much about whether this bunch of heroes save the world this time. To make matters worse, the five credited writers crib ideas from a certain other Fox franchise, since they obviously couldn't come up with good enough concepts of their own.The actors can't have been too happy about their sub-standard material, but likely the paychecks helped to make up for that to some degree. Some of the roles are pure cliches, such as the Liam Hemsworth character, a macho, risk-taking pilot, and his buddy Charlie (Travis Tope), a nerdy, hungry-for-love type. It's too bad Emmerich & his cohorts couldn't be bothered to really care about their characters. And if they couldn't, then why should we? Co-writers Nicolas Wright and James A. Woods also have roles in the movie, with Wright giving an embarrassing performance as the fumbling Rosenberg.Sadly, this marked one of the final film appearances for veteran actor Robert Loggia (VERY briefly reprising his original role, without dialogue); the movie is dedicated to him.Let's hope Emmerich and friends don't subject us to any more of these movies another 20 years from now.Five out of 10."
" Garbage on an unbelievable scale
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,1,"Hahahahahee hee hee whew! I started laughing in 2016 its now 2020, ok this movie is unbelievable, the fact that it cost $165 million dollars is whats unbelievable, how the hell is that even possible?.
Now I've read quite a few reviews on here & it's reassuring that there are a great number of Reviewers giving this 3 stars & less, that alone reassures me there are still sane people around but its very unnerving to see many giving this 8s 9s & even10 stars, now I won't name the reviewer but I'd like to just share a small snippet from their review;Rule number one this kind of movies: forget about logic in the script, it is about sensation, action and special effects. You want a good story, watch drama, not this.
This person gave an 8/10, this now clears up the mystery of all these OTT scores on god awful trash movies, these reviewers are clearly devoid of not only basic common sense but also a simple understanding of logic & science fiction, heres a clue, the only thing that's not factual is the fiction, its fictional stories involving science, science is the part that's supposed to be based in fact.
This movie is without doubt the biggest waste of money in a long time.
I love action sci fi, comedy sci fi, drama sci fi but what is unforgivable is so called intelligent people completely disregarding even the most simple basic science facts, a suspension of belief to a certain degree is always expected but a total suspension of belief? Ludicrous, it also makes it impossible to find even the smallest part of excrement like this enjoyable.
While so many intelligently challenged audiences give good reviews for god awful garbage then more & more god awful garbage will be churned out.
Modern day cgi, no matter how expensive or how sensational can make up for a garbage story line or plot, Avatar is a perfect example of that & this movie is no different."

" If you liked INDEPENDENCE DAY, you may think twice before watching INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,4,"While the original INDIPENDENCE DAY wasn't a masterpiece, it was well made and entertaining in its own way. Almost all of the actors looked like they were having a good time and Roland Emmerich's direction was slick and stylish. Unfortunately, its sequel, INDIPENDENCE DAY RESURGENCE, hasn't got the same magic or entertainingness of its predecessor.For 20 years Earth hasn't been threatened by alien creatures. Suddenly new alien species are discovered and most of the humans (some characters from the predecessor and some new ones) battle the new menace with all their resources. This is basically the plot.The cast is uninspired to say the least. Liam Hemsworth gives a really bad performance, as he is wooden and looks uninspired throughout the whole movie. Jessie Usher as Stephen Hiller's son is very broad for most of the time. All the cast members of the predecessor (Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Bill Pullman, Vivica A. Fox and even Robert Loggia in one of his final movie roles) try the best with the material they are given and I have to admit it, if it wasn't for them, the movie would have been very unwatchable. Unlike its predecessor, this time the movie is more special effects and loudness that plot (although recently Roland Emmerich has improved himself with MIDWAY). Only the special effects are good but they are too many and too much for most of the movie.Overall, I wouldn't put it among the worst sequels ever made but it's close despite this time it's saved by the cast members of the predecessor. In substance, it had potential but thanks to hackneyed direction, special effects galore and bad acting, it's a mess when compared to the first one."
" MADE FOR KIDS
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,4,"OK after the cast reunites and you get to see actors from 20 years ago you loved back then (but were abandoned by Hollywood for age reasons or what ever it is they do to these disappearing actors--I think there's a penal facility inside the Hollywood mountain) you might as well turn it off. Yes again we have the pathetic, predictable ending, and it becomes quite clearly that this is a KIDS MOVIE. After bombing domestically at around $100 million with a budget of $165 million and reuniting the original writers I thought this was a shoe-in, but even with 5 writers you can build a nice pile of crap. The special effects were cool back then with landmarks blowing up and they didn't get weird with the ship designs, but the best part of this movie was the first half where you find out about the aftermath of the first and see a Earth that has integrated the alien technology, yet strangely looks exactly like ours I guess. If you want to enjoy this movie turn it off before the end because the IMPLAUSIBLE ending where they are circling around the queen not defending her (why would she go out anyway in a beehive she is protected and never leaves) as she gets blown to pieces. Though when people get mugged or assaulted humans take pictures, stand by and watch and do nothing. Anyway--avoid."
" IQ BELOW ZERO
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,1,"I started to watch this movie by setting my IQ to 60. However in about 30min I needed to adjust this to 35 and by half the movie again to below 20 and stop watching all together.
The only positive to say about this movie are the visuals and even here there is not much new , but that is not a shame . The acting is however below zero , the plot is below zero , the directing is below zero . Stereo-type after stereo-type are presented time and time again that it hurts . I understand the remarks from some REAL directors that these kind of movies are rubbish. Their remarks hit the spot. Not that we don't need any popcorn movies anymore , but please , have some respect with the intelligence of people instead of thinkin' with your pockets full of money. My advise : don't watch this ."
" TERRIBLE
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,2,"The plot line mistakes in this movie would take 10 pages to type, which is probably longer than the script itself. For starters, the aliens have an enemy that has ALL the keys to defeating them ...... but wait, they were defeating an annihilated by those aliens. Then, the aliens are so powerful that when they send a weapon to protect earthlings, it is shot down and destroyed by said humans. Then, the ONLY thing that survives the crash is the ultimate weapon and Jeff Goldblum's character just happens to realize that it is the ONE piece of wreckage that they have to have. The aliens send down ships that blow up Cheyenne Mountain in a matter of seconds - the most secure place in the United States - but instead of sending those same ships to destroy Area 51, the alien queen decides to personally attack Area 51, instead of staying in her perfectly safe master ship. The alien queen sits a ""trap"" for the humans in the master ship, but instead of it killing the humans, almost all of them survive. We do not know how they survived because their ships were blown up, but they somehow lived! She is able to control all the ships, but the ones the humans are in! Then, the humans in the aliens ships hit their ""warp drives"", but somehow avoid crashing even though they are in the middle of literally thousands of alien ships. Then, instead of protecting the queen which is what they were there to do, they let the two humans in to destroy her. The list goes on and on and on. Do not waste your time of this movie."
" Sorry film
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,1,"No Smith equals no success. Sorry acting, actors, and script. Snore."
" This films are made only for one reason!
",2019-11-30 00:00:00,1,"This two films are trying to impose us this thought: 'There can be an alien attack and all nations should come together and fight together.' The first film was better, because it was the first film that is made that gives this message. And this second film is just a bigger version imposing us the same thought.
This 'Let's unite' thought sounds good but actually it is not. With this thought that USA gives, they want all the powers of the nations want to be controlled in on hand, and they want to control it. We humans should be their workers and the rulers will control us all.
Now, how the world is, the conflict between nations and different religions, makes it hard to control. So they try everything for the world to be ruled from one center and this outer earth alien attack is a good idea. I persionally think that it is the only idea they have. So with all their big movies, they are imposing this on us.
If you don't believe me, look all the sci-fi or superhero movies that they made since 20-30 years. Almost all these movies give us the same idea: Aliens might attack, aliens might attack, we should unite, we should spend all our money to army, to technology, to space investment. We people should only work for this.
So they are not making movies anymore like E.T. or friendly aliens. (Maybe there is few exceptions that I don't know, but they are not big movies for sure)Go do your own research. This movies are just brain-washing and their only intent is to put some thoughts in our minds.
This uniting nations and peace idea is fake. You can see this in their movies, Americans always saving the Earth and they just put few other characters from other Nations to show that, all nations should work with USA...
Wake up guys!"
" Ugh
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,1,"I loved Independence Day so much!
When I saw a sequel was in production, I could not wait to see it!Then when I saw it, I could not wait for it to be over.
15 hours of my life I'll never get back.
(Or at least that's how long it seemed)."
" A very very long trailer
",2019-11-20 00:00:00,1,"To be fair it has been a long time since I saw the film, but luckily my reaction at the end was potentially the most rememberable thing about. Shortly after I finished watching it on T.V. I looked up on to see how long it was, and I couldn't believe it. If I remember correctly, the run time of the film was exactly the same as the run time of what I saw on T.V. After watching it I had expected that at least half of the film had been cut for time or something. I don't think I can call Independence Day: Resurgence a bad movie, because I don't think I can call it a movie. Watching it feels like watching a long trailer where bits and pieces of the film are shown. As a film this deserves no stars, but as a trailer it is actually pretty good. After watching it I wanted to see a real movie that was a sequel to Independence Day. Not enough to see it in theaters though, as the movie does look like it contains a ton of cliches with nothing new added to the genre. Perhaps I'd like to wait for it to come on T.V."
" CGI fest with garbage scriptwriting, unbelievable characters
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,1,"Just 2 hours of wasting your time with explosions and flashing lights. No coherent plot to be found anywhere.Truly a disgrace to the original.Also, the movie falls victim to the destructive trend of shoving female characters in roles which aren't really appropriate for them, only in the hopes that it appeals to the feminist audience.Movie doesn't deserve more than 1 star."
" Vivica A. Fox
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,1,"It wasn't believable that Vivica A. Fox's character would have the job she has in the sequel. After all, she was a stripper in the first one."
" It's the same as the first movie, but way worse than ever.
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,2,"The only things that i liked in the movie was the sound and a scene where the character of Liam Hemsworth is taking a piss in front of aliens and while doing that he starts showing a middle finger to them and uses this for a distraction. Aside from that - ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is a piece of garbage and proves that some movies work way better as a standalone and don't need a sequel at all.Basically: Roland Emmerich takes the things from the first movie that were executed so well and makes they worse. The story, characters, dialogue, acting, cinematography, music and visual effects - all of those aspects were made way worse, than everyone could have imagine. It will go down in history as not only one of the worst sequels out there, but also one of the worst movies of 2016."
" It's fairly poor - but would probably make a good XBox game - maybe, possibly
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,2,"It starts at a juvenile pace (as in, the pace a juvenile would tolerate - before they go to the fridge to graze. The music & sound FX are tired - like someone is throwing cups at the keyboard. Pimlot phones in his performance, Hemsworth does a fair job as the lantern-jawed fighter and then there's Goldlum.... In this movie he is truly replaceable by a lump of steamed ham - you wouldn't notice any difference. As usual Goldblum is also creepy... and a bit greasy. The film goes nowhere, but it goes there noisily and with zero charm or excitement"
" Nowhere as bad as most reviewers here are claiming-- indeed, good for the genre
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,8,"Come on! No one sitting down to INDEPENDENCE DAY: RESURGENCE could be expecting CITIZEN KANE, THE GODFATHER, or 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, or even FORBIDDEN PLANET or CURSE OF THE DEMON. One should expect-- more of the same. And that is essentially what one gets, though overall I think it a better film than the original. The original had, besides killer special effects, the great suspense of the buildup to the alien attack. Sadly, much of the character-driven scenes ranged from the forgettable to the lamentable; but then, to expect more from such a film is like drinking a glass of ginger ale and expecting Dom Perignon. This film does have a few annoying aspects, such as the reverberation of the squirm-inducing speech of the President in the original, and Judd Hirsch's ""Julius Levenson"" character is as irritating as ever (although that may indeed be because he's MEANT to be irritating). But, apart from some such long scenes near the beginning, mostly to establish the new or newly-grownup characters, such scenes here seem less intrusive. And while it lacks the asset of the long, tense buildup to the attack that the original has, well, after the alien attacks the rest of the original seemed long and anticlimactic. This film is structured better, and actually climaxes near the end. And though the ""disaster porn"" sequences of destruction could have been longer, they were inventive and very well done. Also I must mention how much I liked their making Doctors. Okun (Brent Spiner) and Isaacs (John Storey), who in the original seemed to be only friends and coworkers, lovers (or more properly, life-partners) -- and so sweetly, too. That Dr Isaacs visited and talked to a comatose Dr Okun every day for two decades was a devotion few but the most devoted couples, straight or gay, would ever evince; it was only on second viewing I noticed that, just before the attack on the isolation chamber which would kill Dr Isaacs, almost instinctively and without even looking, they hold hands-- a tender gesture amid the violence and confusion. (Unlike so many gay relationships shown in film today, theirs seemed gentle and natural and not centered on wantonness.) Anyway, I found this film was, overall, more enjoyable than the original. It's hardly a classic, of course... but for its genre, it's quite good enough, and certainly not the disaster some reviewers are dismissing it as."
" Surprise

" A poor follow up to the greatest alien movie ever
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,4,"This movie sucks compared to the original, which in my opinion is the greatest alien movie ever. Stand alone it is ok. The story has enormous plot holes, poor character arcs, and cheesy dialogue. Some plot holes include: why are they drilling to our core to destroy the planet? If they wanted our planet for resources it defeats the purpose. If the space ball was so smart and had the secret to defeating the aliens, why did they get wiped out? Why did the Queen have thousands of ships around her but they did nothing when we fired on her?? There are plenty more.Second, the Chinese propaganda is almost nauseating. Hollywood, in all their wokeness, forgot that they are praising what is basically an authoritarian regime. To be fair, reverse engineering is what the Chinese do best...There is no real plot or character development. The aliens come but there is no real calculated escalation like the first one, there is just plain mayhem. The characters make no sense to me either. Why did I need to know Professor Okin was gay? His boyfriend had no purpose to the movie at all. Even Okins character jumped all over with little real reason. Also what happened to Goldblums ex wife from the first one? She was never even mentioned.The redeeming qualities are that the action is really fun. We get to see some ground action vs just areal battles in the first one. The air battles are cool as well. They also did a good job throwing back to some nostalgic characters from the original."
" Actual score is 7

",2019-08-17 00:00:00,3,"Twenty years on from the original movie, which I thought was very over rated, Earth once again comes under attack from aliens.
Special effects play a BIG part in Resurgence, it is pretty much non-stop. Some are good whilst others look cheap. Either way, this film is silly, cheesy and boring. I can only assume that it was meant to be comical, though I didn't find it's cheap humour very funny. Granted, watching this on the big screen would have been better but I certainly would have felt cheated paying to watch this. At least watching movies like this at home means there's the ability to pause now and then, to get up and have a walk around, thereby breaking up the tedium.
Poor. It looks like a Sci Fi Channel movie, only with a much bigger budget."
" Interested then frustrated beyond belief
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,4,I was deeply interested in watching this. From the first one. Watching it was a different story. Frustrating how the lack of urgency in characters is abundant. You would think it's not the end of the world. Plus the effort for humor was just cringeworthy. What made me watch this was just the visual effects and the displays of technological development!
" If you value the ID4, don't listen to the whiners here
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,10,"This film, though not the same as the first nor is it supposed to be, is entertaining to say the least. The new story I thought was brilliant. The Queen's size is massive, and the look of the aliens NOW is way more disturbing yet extremely reminiscent of ID4's aliens, as they are the same race as in '96. More advanced. More terrifying. The action in this film is outstanding. The special effects in this film are outstanding. I saw ID4 in theaters a total of 13 times, I couldn't get enough. ID4 helped me get through a really bad time in my life so it will always be treasured to me. Resurgence brought back some beautiful memories for me so I value this sequel as well. Anyone who trashes this film clearly has zero taste in film and should never bother to watch movies ever again due to ignorance. Again, this sequel is NOT ID4 so don't expect it to be. It's story is brilliant none the less."
" An excellent sequel, worthy of attention
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,8,"Set in 2016, it is twenty years after the aliens attacked earth in 1996. After the first attack, the world leaders came together and created a One World Government. In Independence Day: Resurgence, humanity has salvaged alien technology from the fallen flying saucers and technology is far advanced.
The now ex-president of the United States, Whitmore (Bill Pullman) appears in the start of the film, receiving a vision of the aliens travelling through space, with wrecked planets in their wake. And Earth is their next destination.
Also, Dr. Brackish Okun, who has been in a coma ever since the alien attacked him, wakes up. David Levinson has been made director of the Earth Space Defense (ESD). He travels to Africa and meets with warlord Dikembe Umbutu and Dr. Catherine Marceaux in the African state Republique Nationale d'Umbutu. They travel to an intact alien city destroyer and discover that alien survivors sent a distress call to their home world before their defeat. While there, Umbutu (DeObia Oparei) tells Marceaux and Levinson that when the destroyed saucer mysteriously turned back on (the same one that they are visiting in Africa), he received a vision of a spherical ship that he described as 'fear', same as other patients of Marceaux who are telepathically linked to the aliens.
During the 4th of July celebrations, a mysterious spherical ship emerges near the Moon Base from a wormhole. The World Council want to shoot it down, fearing another alien attack, but Levinson protests, stating that they don't know who they are and they could unintentionally start a war. The Council doesn't listen, and has the Moon Base shoot it down. Levinson wants to go up to the Moon to inspect the wreck to discover who the aliens are, but is instructed to stay for July 4th. So, two Americans on the Moon Base - Jake Morrison (Liam Hemsworth) and Charlie Miller (Travis Tope) - steal a space tug and take Levinson, Umbutu, Marceaux, and U.S. federal controller Floyd Rosenberg (Nicolas Wright) up to the Moon. They go to the wreck and find that inside part of the ship's wreck is a large container with a giant white sphere. While going to retrieve it, an alien mothership suddenly appears, responding to the signal sent out from the saucer in Africa. It destroys the Moon Base and destroys a lot of the earth's planetary defenses. It then lands over the North Atlantic Ocean.
Also, it also has it's own gravity and lifts up city buildings, cars, and people, which then all drop down.
This is where some of the characters from the first movie are killed - Jasmine Hiller (Vivica A. Fox), (Steven Hiller is mentioned to have died before the sequel). But, this time, Emmerich does not destroy the White House. The space tug with Morrison, Miller, Levinson, Umbutu, Floyd and Marceaux also travels back down to earth with the mothership. They travel to Area 51. After the mothership lands over the ocean, it begins drilling down to the earth's core.
In Area 51, Whitmore interrogates one of the aliens in captivity, but his mind is telepathically invaded by the alien, much like Dr. Okun's experience, and learn that the aliens exist in eusociality and that one of their colossal Queens is commanding the invasion. But, when Marceaux shows him a drawing of the spherical ship, it reacts in fear. They kill the alien, freeing Whitmore, who is placed in a coma from the experience. Levinson hypothesizes that, if they kill the supervising Queen, her forces will cease drilling and retreat. An ESD aerial fleet, led by Captain Dylan Hiller, stages a counterattack, but they are caught in a trap within the mothership, leaving only a few survivors, including Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and fellow ESD lieutenant and Chinese pilot Rain Lao.
Okun opens the container and takes the sphere out, which they discover used to be part of another alien race that changed to a virtual existence. The sphere tells them that the aliens are going from planet to planet, harvesting the natural resources to preserve their existence. The sphere also says that she takes the survivors to a secret refuge planet and is going to unite them in an attack against the Harvesters' home base. Meanwhile, In the mothership, all surviving ESD pilots manage to escape by hijacking enemy craft; Dylan, Jake, Charlie, and Rain navigate two Harvester fighters to pursue the Queen's personal ship, which is heading to Area 51 to extract information from the sphere about the refugee planet. The Harvester Queen becomes aware of the sphere's existence and location and heads towards Area 51. In Area 51, they recreate the sphere's signal and lead the ship towards a trap. Some of the Queen's ships begin attacking Area 51.
Whitmore enters the ship and blows it up, sacrificing himself. At first, they all think that the Queen's dead, but her ships still attack them. Then the Queen emerges from the wreck. She heads for the part of the Area 51 base where the sphere is hidden. Her ships swarm around her, protecting her. The Queen grabs the sphere. Morrison, Miller, Dylan, and Rain - who are in two of the Queen's ships - break free from the swarm and kill the Queen.
The ship drilling in the Ocean towards the earth's core stops just two minutes from breaching the core and the ships retreat, called back by the other Harvester Queens.
At the end of the film, Okun tells everyone that the sphere wants to give them advanced technology to travel to the Harvesters' planet and fight them to get rid of them once and for all.
I LOVE this movie! An excellent sequel, magnificent special effects, great storyline. Oh, I forgot to mention why the Harvesters were drilling towards the earth's core - to drain the resources, which would destroy earth's magnetic field or something, killing all life on earth. It has more action, and excitement than the first one and has a much bigger threat to humanity than the first one. But, I think the first one is actually the best.
It's a pity that it was not popular like the first movie, as then Emmerich would have done a third film about them travelling to the Harvesters' planet and engaging them in a fight to destroy the Harvesters. It would have made an excellent end to the story and would have made a great movie. I also love how they include the telepathic link between some of the humans and the aliens as it creates an interesting element. In fact, my favourite line in the whole movie is when Whitmore wakes up from his coma and says: ""You've got to warn them! She knows that they are coming."" In conclusion, I would recommend watching this. It is enjoyable, fun, tense, and exciting."

The Brexit vote was counted during the screening and when everyone exited the movie the press were sticking mics in the faces of celebs asking them for their opinion on Britain leaving the EU - a fitting occurrence considering the title of the movie.Sadly, the film bombed, raking in just $100,000,000 during it's run, a fraction of the original's box office takings. It was too little too late. A 20-year gap between movies was just too long and the politics and culture of the US is now drastically different. Independence Day came out in a time when spirits were high, the '96 Olympics had everyone pumped up, the summer season was full of exciting blockbusters, and painful, boring superhero movies were virtually non-existent. Fever Pitch was the feeling all summer long and a jingoistic, heroic movie was exactly what audience wanted at the time. ID:4 delivered all that and more. In 2016 the culture war had already started and self-hatred in America was beginning to rip the country apart. Independence Day 2 really should have come out in 2000, when there was still optimism, but Roland Emmerich was too busy making The Patriot during that time, plus he and Dean Devlin had no idea how to tackle the gargantuan scope a sequel would inevitably have.It's a shame, because this is actually much more thoughtful film than the first and I really dug the psychic storyline. But everything else in the film is pedestrian and lazy, even for Emmerich these cliches and tropes are tired and dull. Remember David Arnold's rousing, exciting score from the first movie? Of course you do! It's not here. Instead, excruciatingly untalented ""composer"" Harald Kloser (also serving as producer) cranks out worthless noise that a high-schooler could beat. There are musicians with real talent out there, chomping at the bit to get a start in movies and yet this man constantly gets work (only with Emmerich). It boggles my mind.With Will Smith asking for a stupendously arrogant $50,000,000 paycheck they wisely wrote his character out. How dare this man ask for that money! His star power has been on the decline for years now (thanks largely to fast-tracking his untalented children into movie stardom) and he should have embraced this movie as a comeback. Margaret Colin is also written-out with no explanation within the movie (in the prequel novel she died in a car wreck). Mae Whitman has been replaced with Maika Monroe because she didn't grow up to be pretty enough, apparently. At least Brent Spiner came back (his character's fate was left unexplained in the first one, be he was never written to die, it just seemed that way) and Jeff Goldblum is front and centre, whether he likes it or not, but he's got the charisma to carry it. He's certainly far, far more appealing than the lesser Hemsworth and Jessie Usher, who are given virtually nothing to do and really shouldn't have been in the movie when their screen time could have been used for building suspense instead.The scenes of destruction in the first movie were breathtaking at the time, and still have impressive effect all this time later thanks mainly to the extensive model work used (ID:4 holds the record for the most model work ever used in a movie, which will likely never be broken thanks to the advent of excessive CGI) but we're so used to scenes of cities being destroyed at this point that none of the effects, no matter how elaborate, really fill us with awe.The model work and real locations in the first movie gave it a tangible realness and placed it in a world you could identify. Here literally EV-ER-Y-THING is done against a green screen, giving far too many shots a flat, static look where the lighting on the actors doesn't match the light on the CGI background. It's horrible, and gives the film the look and feel of a cheap TV movie. This is Emmerich at his laziest. There's no passion behind this.First time around we had a double climax and two reasons to cheer (and, believe me, audiences did). No such luck with the sequel. The ending is completely disappointing and any excitement you might feel will completely fizzle out before the credits roll. They strongly hint at a third movie, but there's no way that will ever happen now. The energy in this franchise drained out a long time ago and the culture in the US is too self-hating to embrace it.I really wanted to like this movie, and it has some really good ideas, but it squanders all of its potential and sleepwalks through poorly-directed familiar territory. Such a huge shame."

" not a bad movie
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,8,I actually prefer this on to the 1996 one that felt way to (team america) i know it's called independence day and is american made but at least this one actually acknowledges the rest of the world exists hence it has a richer history and fuller story all round i remember seeing the one in 96 and thinking never gonna watch that again the only part i remember thinking was funny was will smith punching an alien hardly worth 2 hours
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,1,"HORRIBLE. the new actors were terrible, the returning ones were shells of their old selves. the dialogue was horrendous. the story could be considered not horrible if you don't pay attention to it at all. but you can probably expect some of that with these summer blockbuster popcorn flick types of movies. what is unforgivable is that it wasn't entertaining. it wasn't fun. and the action was terrible. in the action scenes, I had no idea what was happening. things seemed to just happen just so they could happen, with no reason why. (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
my favorite line was when the camera zoomed on Liam Hemsworth and he says ""Nice."" Also, the very end of the movie had a set up for a sequel that was so painfully obvious that my jaw dropped. i seriously couldn't believe it. and the reasoning was horrible. something along the lines of ""we now have their technology so we need to bring the fight to them, we're gonna to go into outer space and kick their ass. YEA!"""
" Totally bad and disastrous, a sad sequel.
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,3,"While many people consider the original Independence Day movie an entertaining one, a fantastic special effects milestone with an excellent diverse cast that delivers a great UFO action movie. Resurgence is just the opposite.No soul, no passion, no spirit; a failed attempt to follow the genius of the first that plummets down more and more. The cast is disastrous, the actors don't even seem to enjoy what they do, something surprising from Jeff Goldblum (although well, he acts as he pleases and that's his brand). With a miserable direction and lack of intense scenes, it seems more like a movie made by fans with no cinema experience, just trying to satisfy their fan-service needs.It's a completely forgettable movie, maybe the only thing that can be rescued are the special effects, which are better in other movies. After that, I really can't think of anything really exciting about this movie, it's not even that entertaining, it's a dirty and stupid movie that really only works for those moments when we turn off our neurons and decide to lie down on the bed or the sofa. Bad, that simple."

",2019-05-27 00:00:00,2,"I'm just watching it now because I'm trying to give it a chance but it's horrific with horrific acting.
Liam Hemsworth is terrible and I'm afraid is not a good actor at all and that idiot Travis Tope is one of the worst actors I've ever seen and he ruined every scene he was in.
The only reason I've given it a 2 instead of 1 is because it has Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum and William Fitchner in it.
Why do some American writers insist on having stupid comic scenes in these so called blockbusters? In the first tilm Randy Quaid was terrible.
This film should never have been made."

",2019-05-11 00:00:00,6,Indipendence day is a quite good film but the plot is too simply
" They had 20 years to come up with a sequel, and this is what we get.
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,2,"""Independence Day: Resurgence"" (2016), or should it be known as ""Independence Day: Regurgence"". This ""movie"" has taken a spot in my top 10 most disappointing movies list. Why? Because it's extremely boring, cringeworthy and very obnoxious! Seriously, I can't believe how badly this ""movie"" was made, it's such a crying shame. I love the first ""Independence Day"" film, it's probably the best disaster film in history! So of course I had high hopes for a sequel if they ever produced one. When I first heard they were going to make a sequel, I was a little skeptical at first. Then, I thought: ""well, they had 20 years to come up with a good story. This movie should be a masterpiece if they fully utilized their 20 years coming up with it!"" Then, I found out Will Smith wasn't going to be in it, he was one of the biggest highlights of the original movie. Finding out that he wasn't going to be in the sequel, that made me lose hope for this ""movie"". But, I gave it a fair chance and thought: ""it may be good, even if Will Smith isn't in the movie. They had 20 years to produce it!"" Wow, was I wrong about it. This ""movie"" has a very boring and cliched story, overused sets/locations, the acting is all over the place, and the soundtrack is over produced and generic. The only good element in this ""movie"" are it's special effects, which is a given in modern movies and shows. It's not an especially long ""movie"", but when I watched it, I felt like I was watching it for days! Absolutely terrible, I could've wrote a better script! The plot for this ""movie"" should've been what they had in store for the third one. Where they use the spaceship and go over to the alien planet, fight the aliens, and finally wipe them all out for good. That would've been the smart thing to do for the story, and it would've contrasted with the first one as far as story goes. Don't get me wrong, sequels should have some references to the original film, but it should still be it's own distinct movie. What a horrible excuse for a ""movie"" this is. ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" sucks! I give it only 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. On a final note, there is one thing about this ""film"" that really adds salt to the wound. The tagline on the poster! ""WE HAD TWENTY YEARS TO PREPARE-SO DID THEY"". That's a pretty bold statement to put on the poster. If you're going to include a tagline with such a message as powerful as that, then it had better be a great movie! Which of course this ""movie"" was not the slightest bit good whatsoever. Stay away from this ""movie"", just go and watch the first ""Independence Day"" (1996) movie instead. You'll thank me later!"
" Umm, it wasnt that bad
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,8,"I noticed this movie on my TV channel and decided to watch it. Honestly it was quite enjoyable, plenty of action with some humor. Also the CGI was mostly done quite well. For average movie watcher who enjoys SciFi, its definitely something worth to watch."
" Good movie!
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,10,"I don´t understand why anyone would give that movie a bad rating. It´s at least a 6,5 out of 10, if not better. It definitely stands up to the first movie."
" Sorry for Jeff
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,2,"This was honestly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I only sat through it, because my kids seemed to enjoy the special effects. I felt sorry for Jeff Goldblum, who I love as an actor."
" Just an alumni meeting.

" Could have been better IF they only hadnt made it. But they did make this disaster of a movie. The only good thing are the Jeff Goldblum oneliner jokes.
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,4,"The only good thing about it: the Jeff Goldblum jokes. Those Goldblum jokes are badly needed to be able to bear this incredibly dumb movie.Independence Day Resurgence is testing my outmost ability to handle frustration, stupidity and excruciating boredom.The thing is that this movie starts out rather promising and the action aint bad either. Millions of dollars are spent on the action, so it does look good, but somewhere in the middle this movie just loses punch and focus and becomes a swamp of blockbuster mediocrity."
" Bad but not as bad as many say

I absolutely don't understand why people rate this movie with only 1 Star. Of course it's a bad movie but and i rate this movie with 5 Stars but 1 🙈🤔?!"
" The first movie to make me look at my phone in the theater
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,2,This movie's bad. Even the effects and returning cast members can't save it. This's the first time I ever went to a movie theater and had to turn on my phone because I was so bored. The acting's stiff and the story drags on as the movie progresses. Honestly this movie didn't need to be made. Instead of improving the story and characters it gives us the same thing basically. Jessie Usher though and Liam Hemsworth are fine and the action and effects are cool which's why I gave it 2 stars but that's about it. Aside from that skip this movie it's not worth it.
" A real masterpiece of ""totally illogic"".
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,2,"The ""good guys"" survive any disaster, no matter how big, kids drive through debris without any obstacles in their way after a major disaster/attack...Anyone into absolutely bullsh... stories will still like this film (after all, it is packed with nice CG effects and spaceships) but those you prefer to watch non-stupid films with at least a bit of intelligence and common logic in it, will surely turn it off after 35 minutes the latest.All the nice special effects cannot make up for the stupid story, the illogical script, and all the pretty poor acting. Lots of money wasted for a bad movie."
" Flat Soda
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,1,"ID4 Resurgence seeks to cash grab on the continuation of its successful predecessor by infusing an international presence, hyping up the action with a futuristic sci-fi plot, wasting Jeff Goldblum, adding to the alien mayhem, and setting it up for a disastrous third act movie. It doesn't sit well with you when you realize how halphhazard this whole thing really was."
" Great movie

" An unnecessary film that merely highlights a Hollywood who is trying too hard to cash in on 1990's nostalgia.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,5,"Can we just be real for a second? Is the nostalgia factor so strong in Hollywood these days that anything coming upon its 20th anniversary is re-made, rebooted, and sequeled to death? Certainly, this is a pretty good marketing strategy, since last year's Jurassic World (2015) was such a huge financial success, even though it was essentially the exact same plot as the original Jurassic Park (1993). Clearly, the millennials who grew up with these films want to see them on the big screen again, 20+ years later with newer and flashier special effects. After all, Moore's Law implicates the visual style should be more than 1,000 times better than its predecessor.Here's the problem I have with this re-quel that seems to be going around: it doesn't give us anything new. Take Independence Day (1996) for example. This film was a great action film filled with plenty of interesting sci-fi, memorable characters, and brief moments of tension-lifting comedy. Now, fast forward 20 years and now we have Independence Day: Resurgence (2016). While the same elements were there, it just didn't have the same spark as the original. Sure, it had some of the exact same characters, aged 20 years, and it even had new characters to replace the ones who didn't appear in this sequel. But for some reason, I just didn't care about them. These characters were in a future different from this current time, which merely added to the disconnect.Sure, the film takes the logical next steps after the conclusion of its 1996 original, but everything just felt so . . . forced. What made the original great was its focus on the United States standing up and leading the charge against alien invaders. With the world in the film now united, ""Independence Day"" just doesn't have as much of an impact to the audience as it did when Bill Pullman gave his famous, presidential speech. Sure, they tried it again with another speech, and another plot that almost exactly mirrors the originals, but that's not why I wanted to see this film. I wanted to see what new things could be thought up, but instead I got 20-year-old leftovers. I'm not going to even mention my complete and utter ire at the clear call out for a sequel to this film. This does not need to be a trilogy, but now it has completely and fully fallen into the Trilogy Conundrum.An unnecessary film that merely highlights a Hollywood who is trying too hard to cash in on 1990's nostalgia, I give Independence Day: Resurgence 2.5 stars out of 5."
" Misallocated resources....
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,4,"A film which looks like a glorified video game with a bit of Top Gun thrown in for good measure at times. A huge amount spent on special effects but a classic case of scriptwriting by committee - there are five on the screenplay credits but not enough was spent on it - rather pedestrian at times, cliche ridden and full of improbable logical holes. Avoid unless it costs you nothing to watch it and can afford to waste a couple of hours."
" ID4 & ALIENS
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,2,"This is basically a rehash of ID4 with a bit of the ending of Aliens mixed in where Ripley fights the queen. They even had Bill Pullman repeating the role that Randy Quaid had in the 1996 version - flying a sole plane up the hole in the spacecraft. So much ""yeah they did that last time"" in this movie and then they go and copy & steal The Alien Queen scenes from ""Alien"" couple that with a main plot line of trying to extract the Earth's core (which was stolen from the 1966 film ""Dalek Invasion Earth 2150 AD"" and you see what a brain dead useless bunch of idiots the people behind this movie really were. Totally devoid of inspiration and creativity."
" Don't just accept the critics. Worth a 6.5 at least.
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,6,"Found a lot of the IMDb reviews quite harsh. I found this film moderately entertaining. Some good moments from Pullman, goldblum and a few others. Liam hemsworth and the 'son of will smith' lacked charisma but was still better than a few 'higher rated' recent blockbusters"
" What a pile of toss
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,2,"Technologically superior aliens succumb to a bunch of dick heads with guns. Heroic Amurica saves the world again with a load of patriotic nonesense. This film was the worst kind of unfulfilling dumb scifi with a really shallow storyline. I like scifi, but please don't waste budgets on this kind of smelly poop. I wouldn't waste my money on it."

" Great 😄
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,7,When I watched this movie I enjoyed it. You don't really need to see the first one to understand it. Yes it will help but I have only seen bits and pieces of the first one and I understood it. Anyone who likes sci-fi will like this movie.
" Stick it out. It's second half is better.
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,7,"I was never really a fan of the original ""Independence Day"". I wasn't a basher. I thought it was pretty good but I didn't understand why it was such a huge movie. I only saw it the one time (that's pretty unusual for me). So when I watched ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" I spent to much time trying to remember who was in the original movie and who was missing. I should have been paying more attention to what was going on now, not then. Once I got over that hump, the movie really picked up steam. The last half hour so is really quite good. I will watch this one a second time. (I wish I saw this in 3D.)"

" Dr. Okums Underwear
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,2,"One has to wonder ""am I getting too old to appreciate films"", or is it that these directors just have no good sense of film making anymore.To bring us up to speed on the ID4 franchise, we decided to watch the first one. 20 years later, it's still a solid movie. It's an American Film about American's leading the charge, pulling themselves up by the bootstraps against impossible odds, and leading the world to victory. A bit campy, yes, but It's coming from an era where Hulk Hogan was a great American Hero, and nationalism and patriotism weren't four letter words.And you could hack Alien Technology with an Apple Powerbook...It was epic, it was explosive, it was a good story and the good guys won. I still got a chill over the Bill Pullman speech.This however was just... boring....The biggest flaw was that it was simply too big to be believable. After the Mothership enveloped 1/3 of the planet, drops an EMP and started mining, in my mind the insurmountable odds really became insurmountable. It's like ""how do you really expect to beat that"" unless you deus ex machina the bejezus out of the story, and that simply is what happens.In the original, you had time to care about the actors. This was more characters doing more things, and then things happen, and then there are things. You are expected to care about the characters not because they are important or interesting, but because you are told that in order to enjoy the film, you need to care about these characters.The replaying of tropes from the original also got annoying and tiresome. We get it, one liner here, echo back to something there... That's just lazy script writing. And of course, you have the dorky side character for the quasi comedy relief. I can't think of a movie I have seen lately where there wasn't a dorky male character being a dork.Nowadays it's fair to say that Chinese Production companies are ruling Hollywood and it shows. China has become the big market to appease for films, and so a lot of movies that have come out in the past 10 / 15 years are more catered to Chinese Markets rather than Western Markets. So you have an action, a commedy, and a drama all wrapped up into one. I wont say I don't mind a bit of humor in action films, but not to the point where characters become charicatures of themselves as in the case of Dr. Okum. In the original he was a serious, albeit eccentric doctor. In this, he was more like the eccentric mad scientists who was kept around for comedic purposes.Not surprised it didn't do well, and even less surprised that there wont be a third one. Could have been interesting, but just moves from topic to topic like one rambling run on sentence. Typical post-modern story telling where God forbid you have some dramatic pause, or silence in between scenes.Nowadays I rate movies on whether or not they are worth downloading, and the answer to this film is ""save your bandwidth""."
" A disappointingly bad sequel
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,4,"Independence Day: Resurgence is unfortunately a disappointingly bad sequel. It's cg is impressive, Jeff Goldblum is great and the action is enjoyable but the humour is bad, the plot boring and predictable and the new characters are one dimensional. Will Smith is undoubtedly missed and most of the plot points are derivative, having been done in better movies. It also sets up a sequel that I never want to see."
" Fails at even being a big, brainless blockbuster
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,4,"Nothing wrong with a big, brainless sci-fi (see its predecessor) but it's got to have at least some dramatic weight, be decently acted, have a character to care about as well as some good one-liners. This film fails on almost all counts: The exposition and pep talks are beyond cheesy, the performances often bad, the characters too numerous and forgettable (save for Drs. Okun and Isaac's cute couple) and the one-liners in one ear out the other, save for one: ""They like to get the landmarks""."
" Panders to the lowest common denominator
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,2,The creators of Independence Day: Resurgence must have thought their target audience was stupid. This movie panders to the lowest common denominator and spells out plot points to a ridiculous degree. It's a hollow shell of a sequel that takes itself way too seriously. Do yourself a favor and watch the original movie instead of this one.
" Made for americans only
",2018-12-12 00:00:00,3,"American president in charge for a international space station? Never.
On a spacestation ancestory means more than skills? I don't see that happening.

" Don't bother
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,1,"The original wasn't a great movie, but it was 1000 times better than this sequel. Don't waste your time. Don't bother."
" Not bad, worth view at home
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,7,"From the start, it's very similar plot to the original ID. The concept is....what if they came back? There are many scenes where former/key characters are referenced to and receive premonitions or warning signs the aliens are coming back. I can definitely attest to plot holes and a lot of deus ex machina explanations. However, plot is easy and (if you take the movie for wat it is) ending is fulfilling-ish."
" Not Horrible but Not Great
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,5,"So, it's not as horrible as people are making it out to be. There are some good elements, but there are also some terrible elements.First off, script writers are making the horrible mistake today of trying to force too much cheesy humor into movies that should be serious, and it ruin it. There were way too many attempts at humor in this movie that were just out of place.Dr. Okun returning? Not so much. Didn't really need him. I liked President Whitmore but not so much the role his daughter played. She shouldn't have been a primary. Just a lot of extra people not needed. Didn't need David's dad. The whole thing between the Warlord and the guy with the glasses - again, very cheesy. I mean, when aliens attack the Earth, it's a serious and tragic deal - not something with a Disney feel.I liked the idea of a pissed off Queen returning to retaliate. The whole sphere containing weapon plans, etc. - it was eh, okay. I almost feel like it would've worked better at the ending. They can't figure out the symbol but they figure out how to beat the Queen and then the sphere comes to life at the end and requests aid for the intergalactic war.Again, parts were good. But there was way too much unnecessary humor and too much going on plot wise. If the plot were more simple and serious, with fewer actors, would've been better."
" Bigger and badder
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,8,"Independence Day: Resurgence isn't as good as the original Independence Day, but it's bigger, badder, and a hell of a lot of fun! It's also more intense, and less suitable for children, than the first.Resurgence is set 20 years after the first film. Earth's technology has greatly advanced - mainly be reverse-engineering the alien technology from the first film. A system of defences has been set up to prevent a future alien attack.On the 4th of July, the defence base on one of Jupiter's moons disappears as what appears to be a wormhole appears next to it. Shortly afterwards, a similar wormhole appears next to the moon defence base, and a giant spherical craft emerges. The world leaders shoot it down - despite David Levinson's warnings that it wasn't the race that attacked them (referred to as the Harvesters). Jake Morrison, a soldier on the moon base & friend of Levinsons, steals a small ship, picks up Levinson and some others from earth, and heads to the down alien craft. Just as they retrieve it, a 3000 mile wide spaceship materialises and proceeds to wipe out all of Earth's defences with total impunity. It then proceeds to land over the Atlantic, destroying numerous cities. It then proceeds to drill towards the Earth's core - and if successful, and they successfully siphon it out, first our magnetic field will disappear, followed by the atmosphere, and earth will become a dead planet inhospitable for life.You can guess the plot of the rest of the movie. Humanity - what remains of it - scrambles to try and repel the alien invasion before it's too late, while at the same time Dr Okun tries to work out the sphere that arrived in the spherical ship. (THAT's an interesting subplot - although I won't spoil how.)I love the movie. I love the plot, the action, the special effects, and the broader universe and story arc created. The only things I didn't like were the globalism and the gay couple. The rest - awesome!"
" Forget the critics and jaded fans
",2018-10-23 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed the hell out of this. It was fascinating thinking about the difference in sheer scope and technical brilliance compared with the first.Is there tacky dialog and quips galore? Sure, same with the original. I mean this is Roland Emmerich we're talking about.The film looks absolutely gorgeous with the cool neon blue everywhere. Thought the queen battle scene at the end in the desert was sweet.Look forward to diving into the commentary and docs on the Blu-ray."
" Seriously awful
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,2,"I've only written a couple reviews here over the years. Finally had to log in to say... this movie sucks! The first one was good, stupid fun. This one is just embarrassing for everyone involved. How did they get some of the respected actors to participate in this mess?A huge hodgepodge of everything they could toss in, with little of it that makes sense. Watch it as you would watch Plan 9 or The Room. Awful, awful, awful."
" It was a decent sequel
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,7,"It doesnt reach the quality of the first movie, but it is NOT a bad movie!"
" Good but not great
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,7,"I think that the mediocre ratings for Independence Day 2 are a bit unjustified. It surely isn't a great film, but it is highly entertaining and the special effects are atonishing. In my opinion, that's all that counts when you watch a popcorn movie. 
I watched this film with the lowest expectations and was actually surprised how cool this film is. It has some funny scenes and lots of action-packed scenes - perfect for a night to just relax and don't ponder too much. ;-)"
" My word. You got to be kidding.
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,3,This wasn't a sequel of Independence Day. It's the sequel to Plan 9.
" A Pathetic Cash Grabber
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,1,"This film regurgitated what was on the first Independence Day film but with older actors that did things different to some little extent and tried to make that look epic in an unfortunately edgy way. What the people who made this film did was make something banal completely for this film. The stupid part was that the door should have been closed to block the young characters who were portrayed by Liam Hemsworth, Angelababy, Jessie T. Usher, and Maika Monroe from being able to escape since the aliens were not supposed to be primitive like the humans and have everything planned out to make them, the humans, even more unable to get away from their fate. I am not surprised all of this happened in Indepdence Day: Resurgence seeing this is an American film made by an industry interested in ordinary money."
" Good actors, acting and action!

" Good fun really interesting
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,8,"The internet zombies are upon us but really as nasty reviewers who want to offload their hatred upon honest fun movies.This is a very nice movie to watch. Most criticism comes from haters who don't actually get what's behind this movie. Too many video-games when they were a child with mum and dad busy doing their thing. May you unclutter your mind and cleanse it off of the dark miasmas and parasites that entered it via the games and TV Programming (that's why they're called Programs).One huge thing people don't get, which is rather obvious for those familiarized with real alien life, is the Queen + Hive Mind i.e. a centralized intelligence that controls all elements of their community. The 👽Grey ET have it. But so do bees and ants and the sorts. Even humans have it, that's why so many sacrifice for the greater good in such occasions, like male bees they offer their lives for the collective. It's what's the Hero and Martyr Programs are all about. Plenty of that in this movie, too. All in all, this movie is actually good in presenting a series of concepts of real ET life. That's the intention of the movie, it's educational and preparing the human collective mind to the reality out there.Another great ol movie of the kind is Starship Troopers, it also talks about a central Mother bug that controls the minds and actions of the rest of their society.This movie should really get people thinking about how all this applies to human beings. How we all have a bit of Reptilian, of Insectoid, of Snake, of Plant, etc DNA.Really interesting and educational movie and GOOD FUN! Thank you Roland Emmerich!"
" The worst
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,1,"There should be a negative number to rate this movie. 
I would give it -10 out 10."
" Decent sci-fi action in reunion party
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,6,"Twenty years ago aliens attacked and nearly devastated the Earth. Now they are back with a vengeance. Not only to destroy Earth, but to enure their galactic supremacy. Now we humans (and by we I of course mean the american air force) must save Earth and the entire galaxy.The first part of this duo of movies was an action-packed sci-fi spectacular with an ridiculous amount of patriotic flag waving (the American flag that is). So when they return twenty years later with basically the same premise, little new is expected. And, sure enough, it is a good paced action even if it don't really get to the level the original did. It is a copy, with almost no new ideas incorporated. Although the flag waving is toned down a bit, you cannot wonder how this supposedly now united earth and their army) almost exclusively consists of americans (and a few token other nationalities). Anyhow, it is entertaining, just don't expect too much. The only thing that actually surprised me was how much of the original cast that returned for this move. Usually, when movies get sequels or remakes after two decades they are replaced or given only minor token roles. Not this time. Of couse they are supported by some new talents, but it is basically the same team fighting again (except Will Smith). That was a nice touch, and an extra plus for that."
" The countless lives that we lost in the war of '96 did not perish in vain. They inspired us to rise from the ashes as one people of one world.
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,3,"Independence Day: Resurgence is a poor sequel, with weak characters and a poor script.Making a sequel without Will Smith seems pointless, Jeff Goldblum's character's the only quality character and that's mostly due to what we know about him from the previous film. The rest of them were bloody terrible, besides maybe the President and his daughter and David's old man. I remember someone saying in a comment section, that in this one instead of uploading a virus they give the aliens Windows 10 auto update. That's hilarious, it's a shame they didn't employ this person, because there weren't many laughs to be had. Positively, I thought the queen alien was good and swung the direction of the film around somewhat, but you still have the annoying characters present to diminish its quality. Some reviewers are saying the start was good, I don't recall the start being good."
" Conversion
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,7,"Am I the only one who thinks this francise (bothe the 2 released movies and the planned ones, which might not happen any more, btw) could be converted into a really good TV series?"
" What did I just watch?
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,4,I only have two questions-why is Roland Emmerich still making movies and why did I watch this in the first place?
" If your a big fan of the first one you'll enjoy it! Don't listen to the negative reviews!
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,8,"Yes it's not as good as the first movie, probably should of just left it alone. But I actually enjoyed this movie a lot, probably because ID4 is one of my favorite movies so anything I would of enjoyed. The action scenes are sweet, Jeff goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd, only people missing is will smith and randy Q. Give it a watch it's definitely worth watching least one just for the action scenes."
" Insulting
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,1,This work of trash is an absolute insult to science fiction.
" This is truly terrible
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,4,"I turned it off after 15 minutes. Whoever wrote the dialogue should be... well you know what.Gordon Bennett, the exposition is torturous, stupid beyond bearing. I love good fun action, but this is beyond dumb - it is utterly, irredeemably cretinous"
" I'm so disappointed with this sequel to my childhood favourite!
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,2,"It feels like this is not a sequel but a terrible, far-fetched, remake of the original! It had the same plot twists at the same points in the film and even the same one liners by way of punctuation, only this time much less funny. I absolutely love Liam Hemsworth but other than casting him, what were they thinking???? I must have watched the first one a hundred times, it was funny, unique, vaguely believable and intriging. This one was cringeworthy. Sorry. Op"
" Not so good
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,1,"Bored, slow, overforced, a bunch of patriotic clichés."
" Looks good, but still bad.
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,3,"Independence Day, one of the biggest blockbusters of the 90s, is one of those ""love it or hate it"" kind of movies. There are those that defend it and those that despite it. Somehow, I don't think there are very many people defending this one. It brings in the big-budget CGI and destruction scenes like the first one does. Here, however, there is more effort put toward the world built after the events of the first movie, which is pointless given that it all gets destroyed here. The destruction scene in this movie, what the first is most famous for, is really short, and extremely ridiculous. It does, however, look spectacular. Even if the visuals can't make the movie good, you gotta appreciate the effort that went into making the movie look as good as it does. The characters are bland and forgettable. I don't even remember them. I know one of the guys is named Jake, but I don't remember which one. I also remember that there's a girl named Rey, but only because of Star Wars. They're action movie characters. This is the type of movie you go to just to watch aliens blow stuff up, and nothing else. Therefore, there's one thing this movie shouldn't be: boring. But it is. When there's no fighting or blowing up, it's just dull. Fun to look at, yes, but not at all interesting. It doesn't even have comic relief or anything like that. Worst of all, the ending was just a massive slap in the face. Without giving too much away, it's supposed to set up Independence Day 3, something I'm not really looking forward to at all."
" Slightly better the second time around
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,3,"I decided I'd watch both movies in the franchise back to back. Big mistake. ID4 is one of Emmerich's best films and is why I respect him so much. The cast, chemistry, action sequences, and dialogue are amazing. The cgi and special effects were great for their time. Pullman's uplifting speech ties the whole movie together.... then there's the mess that THIS movie made. Resurgence was not good. Period. When I first saw this in theatres, I pretty much hated everything about this movie. The dialogue is bad, the plot was there but incredibly shallow, and there were so many parallels and recurring scenes that were in the original that it was an insult. That being said, if you choose to forget that ID4 existed, the movie wasn't completely horrible. Emmerich let me down. Incredibly disappointed with this movie."
" Awful sequel.
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,2,"Way too many characters, most of whom are idiots. The suspense of the first film is gone and this film is completely and utterly unconvincing. Even Jeff Goldblum, who is usually very good, seemed to have a tough time being convincing. This was just bad on every level. Yuck!"
" The whole movie is awkard to look at.
",2018-06-30 00:00:00,1,"I don't mind the lows and ups of the plot (that's what i watch it for actually, i just want to know how the story plays out.)But the cutting, camera moves (it's just alot of cutting) are so awekard that my eye got more tired watching the conversation scene than the 3D action sequences.
Acting is weird, dialog is weird, you just feel pissed off watching them talk. Plus the eye soring cutting. Geez.But what i hate the most? The chinese girl that the camera just cut to her facial expression with her two big eyes that she doesn't even look chinese."
" Nostalgia can't save this one
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,4,"I had no expectations for this movie. I have to be honest, my friend turned it on and for the first like 20 minutes I thought we were watching pacific rim. It was very hard to stay focused because none of the characters felt likeable, interesting or even remotely memorable. Some movies don't need a sequel. On the plus side though, Jeff Goldblum."
" It's like a 2 year old wrote the plot
",2018-06-16 00:00:00,5,"It's an entertaining film but my god what bad acting and writing. It's like watching a Saturday morning cartoon with real people. So many childish lines by the actors, but again if you like just having something on in the background while having sex it's ok."
" Spectacular FLOP
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,1,"Oh, man! Hollywood and its hunger for money! If a could rate it in negative numbers it would be a -10. The screenplay is stupid and chicle. I think that's Will Smith rejected it (besides the money), everything is forced justified. And the cast is lame. Even Jeff Goldblum looks like a extra with lines."
" Great sequel despite some hiccups.
",2018-05-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie was really good despite some hiccups.No Will Smith was one and another was Goldblum's character remained childless (I thought he got back together with his ex wife?) was annoying but all in all it makes it easier to concentrate on the new characters and older characters that have since the first movie grown up.Chris Hemsworth's baby brother got a role was okay but not much hero material.Really liked how Bill Pullman's character does a Tassadar in the end.I see some people didn't like it but hey at least it was better than the Disney Star Wars movies we've been having (Small feat).Totally deserves a third installment.I couldn't care less what the so called ""critics"" think of it."
" I Give it 3/10 only for the Cgi
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,3,"This movie is total and Complete Garbage And it's sad because the First movie was So good. Cliche Dailogue, Cheesy and Ridiculous. Seriously Stop make this Crap Sequels"
" More fun with aliens in the desert
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,"20 years after getting their collective alien asses handed to them, the Independence Day aliens are back, and boy are they annoyed!It's not entirely a surprise when the ID4 aliens come back. Despite the fact that Earth has used their alien technology from last time to create new weapons and fighting craft, the aliens have some new tricks up their sleeves (if they have sleeves) which enable them to generate vast quantities of destruction porn and start drilling for the Earth's core. Once more, Jeff Goldblum leads the fight against an enemy which outclasses the human race. Last time, Earth's resistance was led by Goldbum (brains), Will Smith (muscle), Brent Spiner (quirky scientist), Bill Pullman (President) and Randy Quaid (nutjob thanks to alien rectal probes,). This time the same people are around except for Quaid (who made the ultimate sacrifice last time) and Smith (whose character died in the interim and is here replaced by a charisma-free son).I'm pleased to report that this film is missing a number of the elements which so annoyed me about the original, such as the only bloke who knows what's happening being the estranged husband of the President's personal assistant rather than a checkout girl from Tesco - the stupidity factor is noticeably lower, as is the glutinous gung-ho US flag-waving, which our American friends so loved. Which is not to say that there isn't some nonsense here: a busload of schoolkids, for instance, whose sole purpose appears to be to shoehorn in Judd Hirsch as Goldblum's Dad again, and provide some jeopardy for a giant alien rampage. But the thing looks great. The destruction is wonderfully presented - director Roland Emmerich's greatest strength - and, for the most part, the aliens and the combat are well done. There are some places where it's a bit difficult to keep track of who is doing what to whom and where they are doing it, but I was happy to overlook that.Don't expect your brain to be stretched very much but, if you enjoyed the first one, you'll probably enjoy this one too.Oh, and it didn't escape my notice that I watched this Independence Day movie on the day the UK voted to leave the EU: I suspect that this is no more than coincidence!"
" Terribly bad
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,1,Incredible garbage. What a shame that the epic movie of 1996 has such a desastrous 2nd part - simply don't waste your time on watching it...
" A Disgrace to the Independance Day legacy !
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,1,Worst movie eve ever seen; the original is one of my favourite movies of all time and this one is a disgrace !
" A so-so follow-up to the original!
",2018-03-27 00:00:00,6,"Loved the original ""Independence Day"", bit the follow up. 20 years later, is a weak copy. Not least is Will Smith missing. something I never thought I would be writing, but his 'son' (played by Jessie T. Usher) is so much a weaker actor.
Liam Helmsworth is so much better, in every way, than Usher, who is more like a shadow, sadly.The story is OK, not brilliant, but OK, while the original also crams out a better story, better action from Judd Hirsh, and Jeff Goldblum (why isn't Will Smith part of the cast - too costly?).As I wrote, why isn't Will apart of the story?!Without, it is a lame update."
" The first one was dumb, what did you expect
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,8,"It was so much fun. My son, 10 at the time of viewing this spectacle, ate up this movie and it's first film. His eyes watching it reminded me of being his age enjoying Star Wars. He gets this movie, Star Wars I can not convert him. I know perhaps I'm a failure there.However, this is a sci-fi fun. There's no real darkness. It's light and fun. I'm a fan man, way to old to be a fan boy. It's space ships, aliens and ridiculous action fun. Will you walk out of this film and cure cancer? No. Will you have fun? Yes."
" Yikes!
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,2,Don't waste your time. Even if you think you have to see it because you enjoyed the first one. It is the definition of cheesy but without the charm the original had. This movie is a perfect example of a studio making a garbage movie in an attempt to make a quick buck off of past successes. I would request a refund if I could.
" The world must come together again to survive an alien attack.
",2018-01-19 00:00:00,5,"It has been twenty years since the initial invasion of Earth by advanced extraterrestrials. The same foes are transported by a mothership twice the size as before. The world's armies seems to have been sitting on their collective hands because the only real defensive firepower is the same surviving armaments and alien technology left behind from the original attack. This time the attacking force is doubled, but hopefully still more primitive. Sequences of sci-fi destruction along with the same drama, storyline and director of the 2012 movie. Chances are that big action, special effects and loudness will sustain you. Needless to say, there is a very large cast that features: Liam Hemsworth, Bill Pullman, Jeff Goldblum, Maika Monroe, Jessie T. Usher, Sela Ward, Vivica A. Fox and Judd Hirsch."
" This was awful, just awful
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,5,The first Independence Day did no deserve this follow up. It only took about 20 minutes before I realized this was going to be a cheesy action-comedy. The graphics are pretty good so up'd my rating from 3 to a 5.
" It's like a Ferrari with a Prius engine
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,1,"I watched this movie at home and I feel really, really blessed for doing it instead of spending a single cent watching it at the theatres. Besides the CGI (that I think it's where they spent 90% of the estimated 165M budget) everything is completely nonsense. I was expecting something like the original, it had it's flaws but it managed to have a decent script with a guideline, some content and characters that we could enjoy. This one is just bad in every aspect except the CGI. It has no content at all and for a sci-fi movie it lacks the minimal common sense. Through almost all the movie I felt like a donkey looking to a wall asking myself countless times ""How?!"". I would rather watch Sharnado's or something similar, at least I know what to expect and would get."
" Don't expect too much and it'll be decent
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,5,"I'd heard so many bad things about this movie only after I watched in theaters. I don't claim it's better or as good as the original but it had some fun moments. The biggest problem was that Will Smith was out of the picture. It was good to see Bill Pullman and Jeff Goldblum back in their respective roles and some new faces to boot. I rented the blu ray and watched the deleted scenes, which added more meat to the movie's bones. The special effects were good too, and if they do make a third Independence Day movie, maybe that will be better. Hey, it worked with Men in Black, so why not here?"
" Impressive in its massive scope, but little else.
",2017-12-22 00:00:00,6,"I personally found that the destruction scenes when the massive ship appears very terrifying, just like the destruction and hopelessness in 2012. Nobody would agree vs. the cartoon nature of this, but that was my takeaway.Although amusing characters mostly propped up by very good actors, I generally didn't care about or was emotionally invested in the people. Maybe that was a way to disengage in the vast death that the story suggested but didn't want you to dwell upon. Thus, allowed more room for comic relief and resolute melodrama instead of being a giant bummer. And with such a large cast, there is really wasn't any time for character development.Very stupid at the beginning as the moon shot down the good guy with no provocation and then they decided to not bother investigating such until the ""celebration"" was over? Pathetic. The world did not have such resources to do BOTH?Flash forward a bit and then we're at the vague but way-too-fast dogfights. These are space ship battles that invariably come up in many big movies and started with the speeder chase in Return of the Jedi. That was the first instance where they sped up the action for the effect but was way beyond human reflexes. (And laserblasts. With all the advancements in special effects, they still look as dumb as they did in the '70s.)There were a few good moments in detail in the action with the school bus chase and the jet crash, but a vast majority of it was very large and very vague.I'm still lost on why exactly that white ball was so important vs. just obtaining the Earth's core, but I have no interest in watching it again to find out. I'll take their word for it this once.So, not really worth the time. (But maybe there's room for a bunch of tiny movies about the aftermath.)"
" Childish...
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,4,"This movie is so childish and choppy, it is literally an insult to the original...there is no character building at all, the dialog is straight out of an Anime movie, and the CGI is so clunky it looks like they threw a bunch of images into a dicer and hit the chop button...I had to stop watching just less than an hour into it, because it really did make me sick to continue...it isn't just that resurgence was done poorly, it actually looks like it was intentionally poorly done..."
" You have the heart of a warrior
",2017-10-31 00:00:00,6,"It is 19 years later. The aliens return bigger and better, but the Earth is rebuilt using alien technology.Will Smith is not in this film, so they killed him off as a test pilot and his son Dylan (Jessie T. Usher) has no sense of humor. Mom (Vivica A. Fox) is back for what amounts to a cameo and is no longer a pole dancer. They did resurrect Dr. Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner) who apparently wasn't killed by the alien behind the glass. Bill Pullman returns as the retired President who initially comes off as senile. His daughter (Maika Monroe) is also a pilot.The hot shot maverick pilot is Liam Hemsworth pretending to be Tom Cruise, but coming off more like Val Kilmer.The story feels superficial. It was not iconic like the first one which built great characters we all loved and slowly went into the action. In this episode, the idea to harvest the earth's life and elements has changed to taking its core, something they could be doing to uninhabited planets. Pac-man is on our side and this leads to a sequel...if they decide to make it. Maybe they can find a way to knock off Liam Hemsworth and resurrect Will Smith. Liam Hemsworth was a bad casting choice, not Jesse Eisenberg- Lex Luthor bad, but a bad one nonetheless.Guide: Hot Asian chick- no personality either. Bad casting choices, bland dialogue"
" It's Just Bad
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,2,"Roland Emmerich has never been one of my favorite filmmakers. Mainly that his films have always lacked nuance, intelligence, or anything worth saying. Usually at the very least Emmerich can make an entertaining film. The original Independence Day was and still is a good popcorn flick thanks to a nice pace, good action, and decent if not completely 2-dimensional ensemble cast.However, this movie is a giant mess. One of the bigger problems is that the cast is too big. Most of the cast from the first movie (with one of the notable exceptions being Will Smith) return in one way or another, but added on to that are a bunch of new characters (a lot I couldn't even remember until I looked at the cast and crew description) that aren't given enough time to develop. Apart from not caring about or knowing half the people in this movie, the other main problem is that the whole plot makes no sense. Why is there a moon base? How did everything get rebuilt so fast? How did they build a moon base so fast? Alien technology only goes so far when major cities get wiped out (which if I remember from the first movie was a lot of them).Thanks to this combination of boring, undeveloped characters and a convoluted, unintelligible plot, I can't even remember what happened in this movie. To be fair, I saw this movie quite a while back, but I don't think I could have described it with much detail then either. Apparently there will be an Independence Day 3 coming out. I will be staying far away."

" Disappointing Sequel
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,5,"The trailer had me absolutely fooled. The excitement level for this movie was pretty high. They had talked about doing one for years and years and they finally got it off the ground. After watching it you are left wondering the real reason why Will Smith backed out. Now I can believed that he simply didn't like the way the story was going. Most of us understand that this film was to be completely out of reality but the first movie was in reason. This movie took a few extra steps than it needed to. What was cool about the first one was the mystery behind the alien nation that was attacking our world. This time around we learned more than we wanted to. I had myself going ""oh come on, really?"" at the screen at certain moments, and I would feel I wasn't the only one that had this kind of reaction. The other thing that was troubling was the pace of everything. The time-line progressed so quickly it was difficult to let everything that was going on settle in. They didn't dwell on the severity of everything and were just in the thick of it so quickly. I really hope there is not another sequel because the way it was left off, the war will no longer be on Earth, and will just make it another space war movie, which we already have enough of."
" Awful...Just Awful!!
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,1,"Everything about this film was terrible. The acting, the story line (or lack there of), the overuse of CGI. It honestly felt like someone had unused CGI clips so just built a film around them so they didn't go to waste. They had the advantage of being a sequel to a blockbuster classic and just ruined it. And why for the love of God, in 2016, were they still using the terrible, ignorant stereotype of the grunting African war lord, in a grass hut in the desert, as the portrayal of ""African people""?! Aren't filmmakers themselves getting bored of doing this now? The portrayal of African people in the 20 year old predecessor was more progressive!!!!Don't waste your time watching this film."

",2017-09-17 00:00:00,6,"This movie has an amazing cast. Boy did I miss seeing Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Sela Ward, and so on! It begun okay. The script could have been better Kinda lost some interest towards the end. If you like the genre, like myself, it is worth watching. It has its classical lines, funny moments, the excitement (not the best but there). Just don't expect a masterpiece."
" Epic Tour De Force Action!
",2017-08-30 00:00:00,6,"Great Riveting Plot, Oscar and Supporting Oscar winning breathtaking performances by cast! Jeff Goldbloom useless character turns in stunning bus driving performance. Judd Hirsch rhetoric throughout movie was unforgettable. Liam shallow performance will make you totally forget about his brother's Thor movies! Epic Must See Cinema!"
" Atrocious
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,1,"Hollywood is at its lowest. 165 Millions to produce this ??? They have the money, the actors, the cgi effects but absolutely zero ideas. Would you be surprised if they still make money out of this horrible movie ? A 3rd one is on the way. So glad I did not have to pay anything to watch it, if anything you should be paid to watch it. It is so unfortunate that they ruined it. Why is it so difficult to make a good movie ?"
" Stupifyingly awful.
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,1,"Some films just test your endurance.Yes, the original was preposterous,but it possessed a certain amount of goofy comic book charm to be reasonably watchable,if only to see just how ridiculous it could finally get...but this thing...I can't bother with specifics, just know everything in this disaster has been done a thousand times,and better."
" They should have called this ' the cheese returns'
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,4,"Entertaining, yes, worth mention, not really. The digital effects are simply terrible! IF you could see what was going on, then maybe it would be worth seeing, but jeez!It's like the graphics people were trying to see how many gigabytes they could put into a scene at one time!Wow! Another thing: don't mix generation Sissy with generation Bill Fichtner! This is like trying to make the prequels to Star Wars with Hayden Christiansen."
" This sequel is only a remake but with larger ""everything""
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,2,"The first ""Independence Day"" was no work of art, but it was a good entertainment blockbuster with its charm. This sequel is only a remake but with larger weapons, larger ships, larger ET's and CGI everywhere all too obvious like a video game from a decade ago and, of course, much worse performances. The story is basically the same: ET's invade the Earth causing massive destruction, humans infiltrate the mother ship to destroy it from the inside and here appears the only difference - the ET queen was not destroyed because she had an energy shield around her that eventually is destroyed by lesser weapons so that she may be physically injured until her death. A boring movie with unattractive characters with zero charisma played by bad actors full of plot holes that I will not go to the trouble of detailing otherwise I would have to write a book instead of a review. I only give it 2/10 because of the effects, albeit bad. Final Note: The symbol of the African resistance with the five- pointed star and an alien muzzle inside the star is very similar to the symbol of Baphomet that the Illuminati venerate (who puts the face of the enemy in its symbol or flag?) and the whole movie seems to implement the idea of the New World Order agenda."
" Dull and Confusing
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,4,"I thought the first film was cornball, but it had some great lines from the likes of Jeff Goldblum, Randy Quaiid, and Will Smith. It also was a simple bad alien versus the Red, White, and Blue. First of all, this is about as dull as any big film I've seen. Nothing much happens in the first half of the film. We are given little human interest stories and romantic encounters. Some of the original cast have come back. For some reason, Judd Hirsch hasn't changed in 20 years. Then there are the hot shots who are going to save the world. Tiresome stereotypes. Finally, how they subdue these guys never makes any sense because what their vulnerabilities are are never made clear. What a waste of two hours."
" Awful
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,1,"Just to be clear: I loved the 1996 movie: what a technical accomplishment at that time, I was in complete awe.What has this ""20 years later"" piece of s**t movie brought us apart from the exact same screenplay and soundtrack? Perhaps by adding less American flags this time? Or maybe by broadcasting a shorter global message of hope with a similar tacky speech? Surely better special effectsthen what else?... a total disappointment.Glad to see Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch and Brent Spiner for their active contributions to the movie. I can't believe Vivica A. Fox participated to it too, even if for a few scenes, how great seeing her character having become a nurse instead of still being an exotic dancer! Some of the new cast additions are also believable, like Jessie T. Usher who didn't over-act like his predecessor Will Smith and Charlotte Gainsbourg for her lovely French/British accent and full of life acting.Yet let's not forget the bad casting choices: Maika Monroe (neither facial emotion nor charisma, how did she end up in this movie?!!), Sela Ward (a talentless impersonated US female president) and Angelababy (her character was dumb). I was already bored by minute 42."
" Now that Hollywood sells to China and every studio is part owned or outright sold to China ...
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,2,"every movie must have a useless Chinese actor/actress and loads of Chinese product placement. How lame. Chollywood is so lame. I watched this until the 240-minute mark and I honestly couldn't handle anymore. I love science fiction, but this movie is even worse than the Disney Star Wars crap... such a piece of crap. The tacky Chinese chick... how do they pick them? Just plain popularity so it sells in China or do they do cheap low quality Chinese casting couch? She was such a bad pick for this. I don't even care whether or not she slept with someone because I am a man...I just care that she failed to capture the role she's playing and actually she has no role. I don't recommend anyone watches the film. Who knew China has Independence Day?"
" The sequel nobody wanted or needed
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,1,I swear if I had a dollar for everything we got force sequels I would be a millionaire.Independence Day: Resurgence is one of those forced sequels as the studio's excuse to make another franchise. This movie should have never even seen the light of day.It's one thing to want to have a fan story but this movie story is so bad that it makes you want to got to sleep and honestly I was started to fall asleep during this movie so much that I had to get up and do other things.Why make a sequel to a 20 year old motion picture? I mean there was no need whatsoever to make this movie not even to make a extra dollar because clearly this movie didn't get a return on the investment that the studio made this movie.The effects in the movie are simply awful and it goes to show how low a movie can go I have seen video games with better effects than this. The acting in the movie isn't worth talking about because the cast was there just to get a paycheck it is clear to see and it has good actors too but clearly a bad attempt to make the movie work.Honestly don't bother watching this movie it just don't offer you anything new just a bad attempt to make more money off a old film.I give Independence Day: Resurgence an 1 out of 10
" one of the worst sequels ever
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,2,"What to say - this was so bad we couldn't even get through the whole movie - we turned it off about 1 1/2 hours in (it's only a 2 hour movie so we didn't care about the ending). The story line was so convoluted you didn't really know what, or who, was in the film. The introduction of new characters was quick and lacking in any information. There didn't seem to be much back story as to what happened to some of the other characters from the first movie - Will Smith's character Steven Hillard, and Margaret Colin's character Constance Spano, Miguel and other kiddo's of Russell's to name a few. Then they killed off another main character from the 1st movie without so much as a hello - didn't know why they even bothered to bring them back. The dialogue was bad, the story line had so many plot holes it was very hard to follow. Most of all, the movie was really lacking humor - something the first movie really excelled at. It took itself way too seriously."
" Incorrect Mass Opinion
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,8,"This is the greatest sequel you could ever hope for made in 2016, twenty years after the release of the original groundbreaking Independence Day. Like many unfortunate films made in a post internet era, this release was subject to a negative energy right from the start, while it delivered everything it possibly could to fans of the original. While the film doesn't have the exact same spark and ""lightening in a bottle"" effect of its predecessor, Resurgence delivers in tone, absurdity, and incredibly well produced high concepts rarely seen in blockbuster cinema. To all those who saw it, liked it, and were ashamed to admit your feelings to your outspoken social media zombified friends, have no fear. There are others who know it's great, and we're growing in numbers. Resurgence is awesome, and I'm not afraid to admit it."
" the worst movie ever?
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen ... stupid characters, taking stupid decisions, lousy interpretations, total nonsense ...the script and dialogues are the ultimate expression of America's psychopathy and narcissism ... it is American exceptionalism at its best...sorry for my English, is not my best skill, but I feel I have to warn about this movie..."
" A little cheesy but A good watch
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,9,Is it as great as the first one. No. But that is a high standard. I thought this was a good watch. If you compare it with a lot of scifi movies that make now a days this was really good. But I feel most are comparing it to the first Independence Day. And that was one of the great movie. I actually thought it was a good sequel. It was fun. It kept you watching. I kept you on the edge of your seat. The queen was terrifying. Just watch it.
" Had to turn it off
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a disaster. It felt like watching one of those comic movies. I couldn't understand anything of what they are talking about so this movie is not explained very well. I watched for 45 min...that was too much. Terrible acting, editing with a not-so-great plot. I was so disappointed as there are some big name actors in this movie. What a tragedy!"
" Big, Long, Mehhhhh...
",2017-06-15 00:00:00,3,"Saw that it was on Netflix, told myself I had to see how it was compared to the original.Ugh.Bill Pullman chews less scenery here than he did in the first one, but still includes too much ham in what is actually a meaningful, moving character... possibly the best part in the movie.The aliens' ship is big. BIGbigbig big. So big that the laws of physics are altered and, while it tries hard, the science makes no sense. If you squint, look sideways, and put your disbelief in a jar under your seat, *maybe* it makes sense, but otherwise, no.I think the biggest fail is just that everyone is taking their parts so damned seriously, and yet everyone is just a one-dimensional trope filling a slot. Too many good actors (and yes, I count William Fichtner, whatever you may say!) phoned it in on this one. I want to give it 4, but 3 is all I've got."
" Surprised at the bad reviews
",2017-06-15 00:00:00,8,"I am surprised at how violently negatives are the reviews of this movie. Grant it, I don't think it's nearly as good as the first. But recall that the first movie got just 2-1/2 stars when it opened. I can understand if you plunked down $10 to see this in the movies you would expect something amazing, but I watched ID2 several times on DVD, and cannot agree with some of negative comments. On its own, it is entertaining. I didn't find it boring or overly long. It is what a movie should be--entertainment--and no one should have expected something more. Of course, it's all a matter of personal taste. The 2014 Godzilla, for example, won praise yet I found that boring and far less entertaining than the 1998 version, which was highly criticized. I guess folks fashion themselves as professional movie critics and feel their purpose in life is to find fault."
" Just absolutely awful.
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,3,"It's kind of like watching yourself slowly being gutted. It's long, painful, and you leave feeling that you've left a bit of yourself behind in the room you just came out of. Never under any circumstance watch this revolting excuse for a movie this a smear on the underside of Hollywood's belly."
" Dreadful
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,2,"I have a note in the first ID film reminding me to never watch it again as it's so awful. However, I had to give IDR a chance. Started off well, and the graphics are excellent (hence 2, not 1 rating), but the plot stretches credibility off the 'gowithit-ometer'. Second note to self ""never watch this again""."
" This is a great movie the 2nd one is better then the 1st one.
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,10,This is a great movie. It is very scary. The first movie of Independence day is scary. This is scarier. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. 5.3 is a good ratting. But this is such a great film that 5.3 is underrating it. This is a 10. This is this movie. It is one of the best science fiction movies of all time. It is scarier then The Exorcist. And that is not easy to do. This is scarier the A Nightmare on elm street and that is not easy to do. This is scarier then Friday the 13th and that is not easy to do. This is scarier then Halloween and that is not easy to do. See this movie. It is a great movie.
" Just Bad...
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,1,"Yea, there's some things you kind of expect when your going to watch a ""Hollywood Blockbuster"" your going to expect lots of explosions, lots of special effects, ridiculously beautiful leads with perfect bodies etc, and Resurgence delivers on that frontthe one thing however that you should never ever expect is to be intellectually challenged or mentally stimulated and with Resurgence the Hollywood machine has really doubled down on that principal, what an incoherent mess? a plot with more logic holes in it than a Wheel of fine Swiss cheese, and talking about cheese there's more of that in this film than Cheese fondue day at the International Cheese Festival, i mean really? what would we all do without the Americans? USA! USA! USA!, its so bad its comical, the unconventionally ruggedly handsome hero who plays it by his own rules and never gets flustered, the Earth may be mere minutes away from utter destruction but with Fonz like coolness he can crack a joke as he takes out two Aliens while also taking a leak, what a guy!, the sidekick buffoon who cant get laid but in the end walks away with the hot Asian Chick, the ex American President orator extraordinaire, fighter pilot ace & self sacrificing hero, who also has a super hot daughter who can double as either a Presidential Aide or Star ship Alien A#$ kicking pilot, just depends on her mood, and please excuse the pun but could Goldblum's Dad ham up the Jewish thing anymore? is that even possible? i mean how do these Hollywood types come up with this Horse manure? The Alien ball thing that shows up after giving all those people headaches for 20 years and will teach us primitive Humans to fight and defeat the other bad Alien's even though we must disconnect our logic circuits and put to one side the fact that they quite openly admit that they did in fact loose the thousand year war against them and had their planet destroyed? and lets not forget how easily they were taken out by the Human's Moon base laser thing that funnily enough had absolutely no effect on the Alien ship that bally is alleging she can teach us to defeat, yea i'm not sure we should be buying what their selling?,The Alien Queen thing that bears quite the resemblance to some other well know Alien Queens methinks? and seems more interested in getting down and dirty with school buses than delegating such things to maybe one or two of the billion Alien minions she must have on her 3000 mile diameter Space ship?so yes as the African guys says, you have to taken them from behind, and that's what Hollywood did with this one, took us all from behind, roughly,"
" Some movies shouldn't have sequels
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,2,"When the original ID4 came out in 1996, I was 15 and not at all interested in seeing it. My friends decided to drag me kicking and screaming to see this action packed alien film...and I'm glad they did! It has become one of my all time favorite movies! That being said, I was excited and concerned that the filmmakers decided 20 yrs later to make a sequel. I figured I would hold off on the theaters and wait until it came out on TV. I am so glad I saved the $10+ dollars. From the very beginning, I noticed very futuristic scenery and literally missions on the moon. Something was not sitting right with this. The plot was all over the place. It should've been named ""Independence Day: This time it's personal"", because that's what it felt like. It was nice to see some of the original actors, but no Will Smith. It was nice that they brought back the children characters, but they didn't even bother to bring in the original actors. It was very, very odd to have Dr Okin because I thought his fate was sealed in the first one, and they turned him into a cartoon character. Speaking of cartoon character, the whole story with the queen...I just don't get it. The original was just that...original. It explained everything and left nothing open. It wrapped everything up into a nice little package and sent it out. It's almost like they were trying to ruin a perfectly fine movie with an unnecessary sequel. Some parts were a carbon copy (the former President's speech, the school bus in the desert, Levinson afraid of flying, etc). I heard there was a 3rd one in the making. Please don't. Please learn from this mistake. Independence Day should have been left alone."
" A Sequel That Never Should Have Been Made
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,2,"I remember ""Independence Day."" Intriguingly enough I don't seem to have ever reviewed it, but I do remember watching it. Almost 20 years ago. That in and of itself says something about ""Independence Day: Resurgence."" I remember watching the original, but aside from the basic plot line of an alien invasion I can't remember anything about it except that Will Smith was the star. Clearly it didn't make too much of an impact on me. So why bother - 20 years later, when many of those who saw the original will have moved on from the experience - making a sequel? And if the original viewers have moved on why stack the movie with a bunch of veteran actors (Jeff Goldblum, Judd Hirsch, Bill Pullman, Brent Spiner - but no Will Smith, because he must have known better and had better options) who aren't really going to inspire younger viewers to flock to this? Some movies demand sequels. ""Rocky"" demanded ""Rocky II""; ""The Wrath Of Khan"" demanded ""The Search For Spock."" ""Independence Day"" did not demand ""Independence Day: Resurgence."" ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" was a mistake. A big one.It's just a bad movie. The cast isn't especially appealing, the performances aren't especially good, the characters are bland, the dialogue is juvenile, the attempts at humour are forced and not very funny. And, not surprisingly after all that, the story - the aliens apparently want to mine the earth's molten core - is bad. I fought to pay attention to this. I really did. But it was hard. It wasn't a complete disaster. Some of the special effects were pretty good. I appreciated the poke that was given to conspiracy theorists - they're ""putzes"" in the words of Julian Levinson (Judd Hirsch). (For the most part I agree.) But a couple of good things can't save a movie that's bad at its core.Some movies demand a sequel, but for the most part sequels are extremely hit and miss things - and ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is a definite miss. Even more frighteningly - a sequel that should never have been made has apparently spawned a sequel of its own, because it seems that ""Independence Day 3"" is already planned, and it was clearly set up by the last scene of this one. Oh joy. (2/10)"
" Suspending disbelief doesn't help this movie
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,3,"Whenever a sci-fi movie about aliens coming from other planets is made, the audience is expected to suspend a certain amount of believability for storytelling sake. The film makers know this as well, but there's a finite amount of realism the audience is willing to part with in order to be entertained.The makers of this movie ask the audience to suspend too much and are unapologetic about it. First, 20 years ago a technologically superior alien race was defeated by a computer virus uploaded by a PowerBook. Okay, sure. There's always a back door / secret entrance somewhere that the heroes find and exploit. I get it. But here we are 20 years later and it doesn't appear that this technologically advanced alien race apparently has done anything to upgrade their technology. Why? Who knows. We don't speak their language so we just have to go with it.Second, President Lone Star... excuse me, President Whitmore has been haunted by flashbacks and telepathic interference for the last 20 years... but instead of trying to learn from his experiences and episodes, he's been kept medicated / isolated for most of the time?Third, there's the whole Dr. Okun getting out of bed after a 20 year coma as if he just took a 20 minute nap? And can someone explain WHY they felt the need to make him gay? Talk about pandering. It had nothing to do with the story or plot. I could go on about the whole pretty-boy / cute-girl ""the world will stop around us so we can spew ridiculously unimportant banter just so everyone can see how good looking we are"" interruptions, but most movies these days that are filled with pyro-porn and loud explosions have to break the monotony somehow.Oh yeah, the plot. There is one? Well, if you consider rehashing the ""kill the queen and the soldiers will quit"" mantra a plot, then... Also, since Randy Quaid had to die heroically in the first one, then you had to know someone was going to try it again in this one. I won't say who, but I'll only say it is tried again.There was ONE part of this movie that I though showed potential. When Jeff Goldblum's team visits the downed craft wreckage in Africa, they could have really taken that part in a creative direction. But instead, it was abandoned. Well, they were chased out. But all movies like this one eventually become a ""we're being chased"" movie, so...Finally, the ending of the movie screamed ""SEQUEL."" As for me, I screamed ""I want my money back!"" Don't waste your time with this movie. The effects were good, but special effects do not a good Saturday afternoon popcorn movie make."
" Not as bad as many say but yea set your sights low!
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,5,Not as bad as many say but yea set your sights low! I loved the original. This one was missing some of the great acting but I still liked the action and Sci Fi. Goldblum is hard to dislike in any movie. He helps save this from a total bomb. I bought a cheap copy on Ebay and will keep it avail for a double feature come 4th each year.
" Best sci-fi movie ever
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,10,"I like the movie because the alien ""boss"" gets killed by the daughter of the president in 1996. How the aliens die is so cool they make gross noises and puke green sludge everywhere. The scene of the dude with his katanas slide under the alien and stab it n the back is the best scene in the movie (my preferation). Conclusion: BEST MOVIE EVER MADE"
" Better than the first Movie.
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,5,"First things first, the Score composed by Harold Kloser and Thomas Wander is pretty good, not brilliant, but good, the best parts of the Score was during the scene ""How did they get the lights on?"" and when the spaceship was entering into alien territory, those parts of the Score were dark and thrilling - i think that particular part is titled ""It's a trap"", the Score is on Spotify, if you want to check it out.Now, this movie is better than the first one because the CG and VFX are so much better, however the scenes where the characters are just standing around and walking around - their environment is clear that there is a blue screen in the background, and that can be distracting, technology still needs to improve so that it gets to the point where viewers can't blatantly tell that there's a blue screen behind the actors. Apart from the CGI, another reason why this movie is better than the first is that it doesn't have that much cheesy dialogue, the first film had tons, this film rarely has that, there are a few lines which seemed off - example the line ""Sir?! We just lost all contact from Saturn"", and the line ""He's on the Moon, remember?!"", those lines stood out, but they were nowhere near as bad as the majority of the corny lines from the first film. The characters in Resurgence were one- dimensional, but it's clear that the Writers and Director wanted the focus to be more on the Special Effects due to it being a Blockbuster CGI fest, maybe they were hoping the viewers wouldn't notice the lack of depth of the characters, but clearly that was not the case due to many reviewers complaints, maybe the apparent sequel will focus a bit more on the characters. The movie plot is ridiculous just like the movie plot from the first film is ridiculous, it's unoriginal and the Director probably already knows that.The performances are well-acted, the actors did the best that they could with the scripts that they were given, however the actress who plays the President overacted and was trying too hard.The aliens were not scary, and that's all i have to say about that.The movie overall was somewhat enjoyable, more entertaining than the first one, the 90s one was boring, Resurgence is watchable."
" Jeff Goldblum, how could you???
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,1,"I have never before felt compelled to submit a review of a film, but the public must be warned. Do not purchase this DVD from the discount bin. Do not rent it from Amazon video. Do not even Netflix it. I won't go into specifics, but suffice it to say: in terms of sci-fi franchises, this abortion of a film actually manages to be worse than Alien 3.That is not hyperbole. Worse. Than. Alien. 3.Do not watch this boring borehole of a movie, and do not leave it in a place where a loved one may access it and accidentally watch it. It's just not worth it.My goodness, what a piece of sh*t."
" Tried twice to no avail.
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,3,"I am attempting to watch this cr@p again for the second time. It makes no more sense than the first time. Rarely have I seen so may clichés in the first 30 minutes of a film. It is an insult to the intelligence of the viewer. Some of the actors (the new additions) have never been anywhere near an acting class, I am sure. Bits of it look quite good and the CGI is not awful. But it is proving impossible to care about what happens to the characters or even Earth itself. Roland Emmerich should be ashamed to have directed garbage like this. No coherence no meaning and no soul of any kind. The actors from the original movie (which was fun in a B movie kind of way) must have been ""phoning it in for a reasonable paycheck."
" Bigger, dumber... not much fun
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,4,"The first movie was big, loud and dumb, but still a fun viewing experience. This sequel is even louder and dumber with barely any fun to speak of. I won't go so far as to say this is an awful movie. The special effects are good, but the overall movie, I would have to say, is pretty bad. The film feels very mechanical. I never really felt invested in the characters or the story. The sense of awe and spectacle that the first film had in the 90's just isn't present in this movie. The beginning of the original was intriguing when mankind is discovering the existence of aliens and wondering what their intentions are. That is until they start blowing sh*t up. That plot point is obviously not a part of this movie and definitely detracts from any sense of tension when the aliens show up and the CGI carnage immediately starts. Ironically, the tag line for this movie states ""We had twenty years to prepare..."" Clearly the people that made this movie didn't make good use of that time and crammed everything in the last minute. Overall, if you are a fan of the original you can watch this sequel out of curiosity, as I did, but don't expect to see a good movie.4/10************SPOILERS************Recommended for those that enjoy alien invasions, ""we're gonna need a bigger spaceship!"", alien queens, ""we're gonna need a bigger alien!"", hot shot pilots with no personalities, nepotism, shoehorned exposition, not so rousing speeches, alien mind melds, African warlords in Space, intergalactic space Poke Balls, exploding cars, exploding boats, exploding planes, exploding buildings, exploding landmarks, exploding cities, exploding moon-bases, less Gold in their Blums, less Pull in their Mans, reminders that this movie really could've used a Will Smith in it......but that's just like, my opinion, man# Of Times Watched: Once"
" Independence Day: Regurgitation
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,1,"The 90's original was a success, so 20yrs later the someone thought it was a good idea to regurgitate it with some of the same cast, bigger effects and aliens – and that's about it! Ageing, sick ex-presidents and 'tug pilots' all become fighter aces, accountants become bad- ass soldiers and a man in a coma for 20yrs wakes up and is up running around in seconds.They've tried to expand on the universe but this boils down to a bigger alien presence and another race which is pretty much the Galactic version of Siri!The same level of dialogue you'd expect to hear to in the 90's runs throughout the movie. The usual classics all appear:""Time to kick some serious alien ass"" ""It's the Fourth of July, let's show 'em some fireworks"" ""Get Ready for a Close Encounter, B****!""The only thing which is interesting is that in the 20yrs since the original the human race has integrated the alien tech into their own but this only allows for a few bigger guns and CGI effects.Out of all of the rehash, reboots being released this is probably the dumbest, most clichéd nonsense of them all."
" Very disappointed!
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,4,"I was expecting much more from this sequel. I'm still not really sure why the aliens left once their Queen harvester was killed. Surely they could have continued with their 20 year long mission to destroy the human race, they seemed to just throw in the towel with the ease of a toddler who can't quite tie his own laces yet! I generally like most films I watch and am not particularly fussy, enjoy many genres, but this film was just a step too far. The lack of character depth was very poor compared to the original, no real heart felt moments. When it looked like Hong Kong (somewhere in China lol) was completely uprooted and destroyed somehow the debris field managed to find its way to central London pummelling into its landmarks. The iconic destruction scenes of the original, the aliens deploying their main weapon above the Empire State Building, White House and Downtown LA, were far better and made the viewer really kind of connect with the utter carnage and devastation that was playing out. And how Geoff Goldblum's father made it all the way from the east coast to Nevada (must be over 2,000 miles) in that clapped out car then the school bus in such a short space of time I'll never know! As a huge film fan I really was so disappointed with what I saw."
" They're back
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,6,"The trouble with Independence Day: Resurgence is that the sequel was released after 20 years from the original film and really there was no need for it.Minus Will Smith we have another alien threat 20 years later and earth is a different place after harnessing the alien technology they encountered.From the first film we have Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, Judd Hirsch, Brent Spiner and Vivica Fox. I found Spiner's character irritating in the first film and here he is some kind of wacky Doc Brown character used mainly for comic relief.Of the new cast Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe, Jesse T Usher are bland compared to say veterans like William Fichtner.However despite a not very original plot and also some not very good CGI, I found the film cheesy fun and we get destruction of landmarks, mayhem and plenty of stupidity. At least we do not get Apple Macs interfacing with alien technology."
" Independence day: Resurgence review.
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,4,"Independence Day: Resurgence takes place twenty years after the original film. Every nation on Earth has managed to solve it's problems and unite against a common enemy. Using Alien technology recovered from the fallen mothership of the last film, humanity has managed to build a global defence system to repel future Invaders. Except this time even more advanced Aliens attack and bring Earths defences down. It's now down to a bunch of newcomers and a few familiar faces to save earth once more.The first 20 minutes of the film has an intriguing somewhat original premise. All Nations are working together using advanced tech mixed with Human tech. Unfortunately that Interesting sub-plot decides to stop there. Instead the film divulges into a re-hash of all the set pieces from the first film. President pep-talk, check. Communicating with the Alien behind a glass wall, check. A scene that regurgitates Randy Quaids characters sacrifice from the first film, check. Punching an Alien in the face when It lands on Earth, check. I could go on but i digress. The film does have a good pace to it. It's also edited competently enough so you can see whats happening on screen. The films biggest problem is that all the new characters fall completely flat. None of them have any semblance of a personality, which left me feeling cold and uninterested in their plight. Even Jeff Goldblum looks completely bored as he reprises his role of David from the first film. On a positive note Bill Pullman seems as though he's trying as President Whitmore, and Brent Spiner looks as though he's having a blast chewing the scenery. Over-all the film is a letdown on what was a promising opening half hour until it descends into what I can only describe as a 'greatest hits' film, filled with bland, uninteresting characters."
" ""So bad that it made me write a review""
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,2,"Probably one of the worst films I've seen to date.Just imagine a movie with the most cliché characters with a bunch of over the top action scenes,a lot of yelling, some down syndrome looking ass aliens and you got yourself Independence Day: Resurgence.I rarely get mad after watching a bad movie but damn i was furious after sitting trough this one.Actually i was so mad i came on here to write a review(my very first one).Would have given it a 1 but the cgi was pretty good,that's basically the only thing good about this film""the cgi is good"".I guess kids would find it fun.So the conclusion is:unless you're a 12 year old i would suggest avoiding this monstrosity. つ ◕_◕ ༽つ"
" I'm embarrassed for the people who produced and acted in this movie
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,1,"I just rented this on Blu ray and can't stop thinking how bad this movie really is. I rented because of all the bad reviews for those who saw it in the theatre (thanks for the warning!) Some of the worst writing and maybe the worst acting I have ever seen. How does Vivia Fox's character go from being a stripper to a medical doctor? When Judd Hersh's character is close to being killed off, his acting was atrocious, it was laughable. This movie is just a re-hash of the original movie (which was a great, fun popcorn movie.) This movie is just flat out Hollywood garbage. In the past 5-7 years Hollywood has really tanked. Dean Devlin and Roland Emmrich should be ashamed of themselves for producing such a terrible movie!"
" Suspend disbelief... and enjoy (most of it)
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,7,"I remember watching the original 'Independence Day' back in 1996. I had never looked forward to a film so much since 'Return of the Jedi.' It was the mid-nineties, 'The X-Files' was at its peak and everyone was asking the question: What if aliens really DID exist? The trailers looked so cool – no one had ever seen such amazing special effects and the clips of fighter jets involved in dogfights against UFOs ignited the fanboy in all of us. I left the cinema VERY let-down.The dogfights were minimal, the story was overly-cheesy, there were major/ridiculous plot holes (remember the Apple computer taking down an alien ship?) and the whole thing just seemed like one big disappointment. And yet it was one of the most successful movies ever made (Box Office figures, anyway), yet no sequel ever came. Now, twenty years later, we have another story in the franchise. And, if you've been keeping your eye on sequels which come a long time after the original, you'll know how they normally turn out.I'd read a lot of reviews before I saw the film and expected the worst. However, about an hour in and I was wondering where all the hatred came from. Don't get me wrong, ID4 (2) is no classic, but it never seemed quite as bad as some people made out. I'd go as far as to say that the first half of the film is actually pretty tense as the build up to the new alien attack cranks up the tension. It did descend a little once they arrived and the lasers started firing as you kind of know who's never going to get killed and who's just there to be offed at the earliest opportunity.Although, what I found its biggest let-down to be is its humour. Things roll along quite nicely until something that's supposed to be funny crops up and just brings the serious tone down. Okay, some humour in a serious film is nice if done well, but it felt like every action scene had to have a 'one-liner' tacked on to the end. Plus some sub plots concerning secondary characters could probably be removed completely to make the film a little shorter (Jeff Goldblum's dad for a start – quite unnecessary).The set pieces are pretty good with plenty of new destruction and we do get to see jets using alien technology fight the alien aggressors. Naturally, our plucky survivors need to come up with something a little better than just repeatedly shooting the new spaceships and – this time – it doesn't involve Apple (thank goodness!). However, if the aliens really wanted to take over the Earth then they don't need to repeatedly destroy our major cities killing most of our population. They only really need to kill about seven pertinent humans who all just so happen to be in the right place at the right time with the right skill-sets to just so happen to foil these intergalactic nasties' plans. In other words – coincidence seems to play a big part in the humans' plans.You probably already know by now that Will Smith chose not to return. Whether you feel that him choosing 'Suicide Squad' over this was a better choice is up to you. Personally, I thought the film would have benefited from his inclusion over some of the lesser characters we ended up with.So, overall, I enjoyed a lot of what was on offer here. It's big dumb fun and there is enjoyment here if you're willing to suspend your disbelief long enough. It's a pity that the humour and annoyingly included secondary characters kept spoiling the mood. Plus do the special effects look so bad during the last five minutes during the scenes in the desert – seriously, it's obvious the actors are just up against a blue screen. The rest of the film was all right (FX-wise)!"
" Stay away - you'll thank me later
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,3,"How to follow up the giant blockbuster from 1996? First, give it a gigantic ($165 million) budget, get together a few of the actors (Goldblum, etc.) from the original, mix in several new faces so you have a good continuation of story lines load it up with SFX and finally hire writers who know what they are doing. Put all that together and this movie should be able to pull in tremendous earnings, possibly challenging the profit from the first Independence Day film. Everything was there to make this a perfect storm of cheesy summer blockbuster and profit giant.Sadly, it seems as though the studio forgot to hire anyone to write a script for this film and threw something together a few days before filming began. Many characters appear and disappear in the plot with virtually no explanation, the plot is...stupid, and I found myself not caring about a single character and even rooting for the aliens to kill everyone just to make it all stop.This movie had such tremendous potential - 20 years to get a script just right and an enormous budget. Whoever is responsible for this lame attempt at a movie should be embarrassed. 3/10 is being extraordinarily generous and is only that high for the special effects."
" I laughed a LOT
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,1,"From the multicultural sappy opening....to the multicultural sappy ending I laughed about a dozen times cause it was so bad. Initially we are led to believe our petty differences are behind us then we in Africa and fearing for our lives cause of warlords the most petty of terrorists. Whatever. My favorite part was when Jasmine...NOW a doctor falls into the abyss. See ya Mom. Watch it for nostalgia just don't expect anything as good as ""My Mother the Car"""
" OMG Terrible!
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,2,"I'm a DIE HARD Sci-Fi fan. I absolutely love CGI graphics. I'm 52 years old and I've seen quite a few cheesy movies in my day. I do not go to the movie theaters any longer and haven't in almost fifteen years. I can't stand the people because they are loud and munching on food and most people are disrespectful. So, I chose to wait for movies to come out on DVD or through one of the streaming channels. This FINALLY came out on HBO and I saved it about a month ago. Just last night I was excited to watch it. I got all settled in to my home movie theater and with anticipation building, I pushed play......This was the WORST movie I have ever seen. The dialog was terrible. The actors were like robots. The few original characters didn't do their previous version any good and that tells me the writing on this script was terrible. This movie just didn't make any sense. There was no heart in it and no sense of unity like the first movie. You didn't feel yourself rooting for the human population to survive. Quite frankly, the cool scenes were when they entered the mother ship and when the mother came out and bashed up area 51. Other than that, this entire movie just sucked.There was some decent star power in this movie which just baffles me. Why did this script even pass muster with anyone? Just awful. I guess there is such a thing as a terrible sci-fi movie. I just watched it."
" The guy who starred as Dylan
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,1,"The guy who stars as Dylan, the pilot captain, is not only a corny character who delivered corny lines with no charisma what so ever. This movie probably stopped his career short because his lines were terrible to hear. I hope this review has enough text......oh and I forgot, Maika Monroe and Liam hemsworth were decent actors."
" How did this happen?
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,1,"I knew it would be bad. But not this bad. I had to create an IMDb account just to review the film, took me 20 minutes to figure out how to find the review button on their mobile site and that was time better spent then watching this movie.As the first film is a classic, I somewhat had hopes that it would be a nice celebration and follow up to the first film. But no.letting this script pass into production is a mystery to me.Kind regards"
" Emotionally and physically bland
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,2,"Independence Day: Resurgence is the highly anticipated sequel to the smash cultural hit Independence Day, which was released in 1996. Several questions surfaced when this film finally came out and was in production, such as why did this sequel take 20 years to finally come out, and why was Will Smith's character not in this film.Independence Day: Resurgence is filled with several many supporting characters which take up important screen time. There are a few leads but overall this film is quite messy, uninteresting, confusing and bland for this type of fair. Despite the visuals being well done, the major problem is the characters weren't fleshed out as good as they could have been. This film feels as if it has been edited and cut down quite a few since their are several scenes that jump back and forth from one other. The characters weren't that interesting for us audience to truly sympathize what was occurring or wanting them to be safe and everyone happy. A lot of the film was severely confusing and not much seemed to be explained. Also, the actor portraying Will Smith's character's son was not well done, he lacked the natural charisma and emotional depth of Will Smith character. Liam Hemsworth appeared to be presented as the lead, but even so we didn't care too much for his character. Overall, this film as disappointed simply because it took the writers and studios 20 years to release this film and this was the greatest they came up with. Nothing more than a lousy popcorn big summer blockbuster that will most likely be forgotten in years to come."
" What a waste
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,3,"Unbelievable is the only word to describe this...and not in a good way. They've had 20 years to resurrect the Independence Day franchise and this is the best they could do? The movie was poorly written, lacked any depth in the characters, lacked any cohesive flow and just flat out sucked. A group of 7th graders could have written a better sequel. There were so many predictable moments and throw backs to the original it was almost embarrassing. Seriously, anyone that didn't' see the alien grabbing the president and slamming him against the glass must have been snoozing or on their phone. Poor poor remake. Whomever wrote this story has no business working in Hollywood."
" Good graphics
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,5,"Good graphics, storyline a little different. At first, it seemed like the original movie, but changed a little as the movie went on. The enemy has an enemy and the children of the original cast have grown up. Not a bad movie, it just needed a better story. Maybe the next movie will be better. They did a good job matching up the actor who plays Dylan Hillard to Will Smith. From the back, it does look like Will Smith."
" It's The End Of The Franchise As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,4,"Released in the summer of 1996, ""Independence Day"" benefited a great deal from a lack of competition. It helped that the big-budget alien invasion flick boasted a great cast and even greater special effects. Its many plot-holes and inconsistencies were easy to forgive in the face of the pure eye-candy and unadulterated sci-fi action at hand. Fast forward 20 years later. We're all a little older, but maybe none the wiser. Likewise for the characters in the film and the creators behind what is now being loosely called a franchise. ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" attempts to bring back the glory days of the '90s when disaster flicks ruled the realm. It's a return to a dumb but fun style of cinema (emphasis on the dumb). Gee, while we're at it, can we get a ""Deeper Impact"" and maybe a ""Return to Dante's Peak"" while we're at it?Director Roland Emmerich clearly has eyes bigger than his stomach. The destruction is bigger and badder this time around, but it just ends up looking like a SyFy original movie on steroids. A yawn- inducing over-saturation of just barely passable CGI, the mayhem that ensues carries virtually no weight. Even less impressive are the film's antagonists, given more screen-time here than in the original. The film culminates in a final showdown between the Queen alien and the human resistance in broad daylight that, quite frankly, looks sloppy even by 1996 standards. Like ""Jurassic World"" a few years back, it's shocking how the special effects in these sort of big-budget blockbusters is regressing to the point where the older clearly looks better, even to unbiased eyes. Whereas the first film wisely stuck to practical effects with the alien creatures and used them sparingly, the sequel tries to James Cameron the heck out of them, but feels less like ""Aliens"" than it does ""Piranha II: The Spawning"" in its execution. The new characters that are meant to serve as the centerpiece of the story are as lacking in charisma as the script they are following is lacking in logic. Liam ""Lesser"" Hemsworth sure looks good but offers virtually nothing of interest below the surface. Likewise, Jessie Usher -- playing Will Smith's character's orphaned son -- is so bland in his delivery and so under-written, he might as well have been excised from the film's already overly bloated cast entirely. Most of the ensemble cast from the original return (hey look, it's Robert Loggia!), with those who couldn't be bothered or bought being hand-waved away with minimal explanation. Jeff Goldblum shows up to give the film just enough credibility in a performance that can only be described as Jeff Goldblumian. Bill Pullman, meanwhile, brings back ex-president Whitmore as a psychologically scarred headcase. Pullman's arc hints at one of the film's few interesting elements, but the character is quickly side-lined and essentially relegated to Randy Quaid status. Probably the brightest spot then would be Brent Spiner's reprisal of the Dr. Okun character. Presumed dead following the events of the first film, Okun springs to life to drill ample amounts of b-grade flair into the proceedings, just enough to keep the audience from nodding off completely.To their credit, Emmerich and his writing/producing partner, Dean Devlin, do a a pretty OK job of stuffing the film with new ideas and concepts that, unfortunately, don't quite gel. There's the typical world-building that has come to be expected from any summer blockbuster, but no connection whatsoever to the real world. The film takes place in an alternate version of 2016 where a woman is president (salt, meet wound) and, presumably, 9/11 never happened. In this re-imagined world, we have advanced light-years ahead of where we currently sit, technology-wise. Meanwhile, the Earth is unified, with warring nations having finally put aside their ""petty differences"" (hey, these are the film's words, not mine). It's fun to imagine, sure, but in today's toxic environment, its less assuring and more insulting. Likewise, ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" is a barely redeemable assault on the senses will ultimately leave you feeling short-changed and all the dumber having sat through it. But hey, blue laser beams destroying stuff! Pew pew pew! Go America, GO!"
" A Few Pluses and A Whole Lot of Minuses
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,3,"Pros: special / visual effects. Cons: directing; acting; film editing; plot / story. The special effects were brilliant but much of story was moronic. Most of the two hours were painful to watch. Overall, the demeanor of the actors was inconsistent with the situations the actors were supposed to be in, which I assert is the fault of the director. And there were some extremely contrived scenes, most notably: 1) on the roof of the hospital. 2) the school bus being where it was when it was."
" Waited for HBO to show it, good thing too
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,4,"The only redeeming qualities were Jeff Goldblum and Data. Bill Pullman's daughter in the movie can't act, and is completely unbelievable as a fighter pilot. The ending is totally stupid(spoiler alert, I guess?). The aliens by every right won the war. The world went from 1996 Motorola cell phones to Star Trek in 20 years? Yea, OK. Will Smith did himself a favor by not being in this flick. Well, I suppose he was in another lousy movie last year. Looks like there will be a 3rd Independence Day. Dear producers, try harder."
" CGI gets three and a three-quarters of awarded stars.
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,4,"I like Jeff Goldblum and wish he were in more films and TV. And I like William Fichtner, and usually enjoy seeing Judd Hirsh, Brent Spiner, and Bill Pullman. So I hope they were paid well for appearing here.You can't fault the CGI, really looks great; but Liam Hemsworth, Jessie T. Usher, Vivica A. Fox bring nothing to this film. I didn't have any hopes for the plot, so I wasn't disappointed. And yet, what can I write: piggybacking off a fun ""prequel"" still produced a bomb. Blame the ""writers"" for cobbling this crap into a pile of s...Watch if you must, I did; but I ain't proud I did. And Pullman had a chance to get killed early on so he could have been spared from being in most of the film; but he held on to die heroically. Better to have died quickly in the first few takes before the audience walked out."
" Not great; more of a comedy and kinda stupid
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,4,"Not great; more of a comedy and kinda stupid. Unbelievable characters and events...unlikely that a stripper (in original) would become a hospital administrator (2nd movie) - not that it CAN'T happen, it was just presented in an unbelievable way in this movie. Events were more comedic than believable."
" DO NOT watch this horrible piece of garbage....EVER!
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,1,"""Dedicated to actor Robert Loggia, who died in 2015"" is the biggest middle finger to a good actor. I think I saw a movie this bad once with Steve Martin but this trash has zero redeeming features, none, zip. I'm not sure how many hours it is, but it seems like five that I'll never get back. A 6th grader could make a better movie with his 4 year old video phone. You've been warned, you have much better things to do with your time. This is a microcosm of what is wrong with this country. It brings politically correct to a level that should never have been thought of, except in your worst nightmare."
" Missing plenty of substance
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,3,"I felt like the movie, as written, would've been 6 hours long. Instead of cutting out entire scenes that didn't do much for the movie, they appeared to keep every scene, but only used a third of that scene. This resulted in incomplete dialogues, causes without any effects, and effects without any causes.It's nice they referenced the first movie, which came out in 1996. It'll be even nicer if they referenced it once, and then moved on. The first 20 minutes of this movie seemed to act as if no one saw that first movie...in 1996, in case you forgot.In many instances, they literally just copied the script from the first movie.I was looking forward to viewing this. and indeed, there were some good parts to it. In fact, with a much better script, it would've complimented the first movie very well. Instead, it tried copying the first movie, just with (sometimes) different actors and larger spacecraft."
" Fun and Uplifting
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,10,"I really like this movie; not quite as much as the first one, but still, it was good to see some actors from the original movie return for this sequel. All the young actors gave good performances.The movie is exactly what you'd expect from the written synopsis, so I won't go into any details on plot or outcome. Just to say that I hope a third movie will be made to continue this enjoyable and uplifting saga."
" A remake that should have never happened
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,1,"I loved the original movie but this one fell way short. The entire thing played like a bad teen movie romance. They chose these actors for looks not substance. Why didn't they ask the actress who originally played Whitmore's daughter to return for her role? What about the kid who played Dylan in the original? The ones they casted were very pretty faces but none of them could carry a scene on their own if their life depended on it.The opening was way too long as they attempted to acquaint us with the characters we originally fell in love with. Unfortunately, I now I hate Jeff Goldblum's character, David Levinson. In the original, he couldn't bare to part with his wedding ring because he was so in love with his ex- wife and still held hope they could work things out. Did we even get a reason why they aren't together in this new one? But that wedding ring that meant everything to him is suddenly gone in favor of a newer, skinnier, younger model. Way to ruin a story line by making it so superficial with a really unnecessary romance. Did every character have to have a hookup? If the actress couldn't return, they could have explained her absence easily. They had no problems killing off Will Smith's character in a very un-heroic way. Same could have been afforded her or have her off screen. And then we have Bill Pullman's Whitmore as a crazy person who has to die like Dennis Quaid in the first one. Oh and don't even get me started on killing off the woman president and THEN giving the new male president a speech that felt like it tried to copy the original but fell really flat.The story line was weak. I'd be here forever pointing out all the holes in the plot line never mind having to sit through this atrocity a second time just to try to make sense out of the plot holes I originally was confused about watching the 1st time! The actors were horrible. They should have never done this and destroyed the story and characters we originally fell in love with.Oh, and the alien invasion and destruction of earth came second to teen romances. Really? Teen Friday night date movie for sure."
" terrible movie that should never have been made
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,2,"This movie was horrible. The plot was terrible and all the film does is remake the original. Liam Hemsworth's, Jake, is the stero-typical character. Another pilot, Dylan, is mad at him for risking his life, so you know the 2 will save each other at the end. The worst part is the very end. The aliens are 1 minute away from destroying the earth's core and wiping out humans, but just decide to quit because the queen is killed. So dumb. This movie is action at its dumbest.FINAL VERDICT: Terrible, the special effects are not enough to watch this. Skip it."
" A first?
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,1,"Was this the first movie to use only first takes? And only the first draft of the script? Jeesh.It quite possibly is the only movie that combines the worst writing with the worst acting and directing. Ever.So happy to see that another sequel is coming out. Maybe it will be even worse, if that's possible."
" Worst Sequel Ever ..... and they are planning a 3rd ????
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,3,I was looking forward to the release of this movie as I am a big fan of the original. I can see why Will Smith opted out of this project. The writing is confusing with very little character biography about the new characters what happened to the old characters like Jeff Add to dictionary ex wife Connie .....the acting below average and the Special Effects did NOT really taken advantage of today's technology. The movie ending implies there will be yet another sequel. I sure hope not !!!!
" This wasn't worth the wait either!
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,4,"I admit that I personally just found the original ""Independence Day"" movie to just be okay. It's by no means terrible and I understand a lot of people enjoy it. Looking back, it's easy to tell that Will Smith was the best part. So how did they mess this movie up? By bringing back every actor except him. None of these guys have the charisma he did. Jeff Goldblum is not entertaining enough on his own. Of all the movies from 2016 that I saw, this has the lowest score on the IMDb and I can understand why. The worst part about this film is probably the pacing. I mean, even for a two hour movie, it seemed too short! I think the entire span of this film takes place in only a day or two. That's not enough time to set up an alien invasion. Everything is so clichéd. I knew that one guy would say he hadn't crashed anything in days. One of the character's father was killed by an alien and there are speeches about how we have to work together to beat them. The characters are mostly annoying particularly with how they just hit on women and start fights with everybody. There's just no one likable here. I guess the special effects are quite nice and the CGI is good, but it's definitely not enough to make a good film. Roland Emmerich should have stayed in retirement. *1/2"
" ID4-2 Nitpicks and Observations
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,1,"Watched this ID4-2 tonight. It was so horrible I took notes to publish on IMDb and other places. Here are my nitpicks and observations. They act so casual in everything they do. From Liam Hemsworth complaining about moving a huge space weapon like its an every day thing to Jeff Goldbloom in Africa just walking around not noticing a giant hole in the ground. When the aliens show up there is no stress or worry in anyone of note voices, emotions and appearance. Its just business as usual for Lady President and company. Like seriously everyone is too casual throughout the entire movie!For political reasons the President was made an empowering woman in a movie prior to the USA election with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. This was confirmed by the writers.The technology was integrated far too quickly in all applications except personal computers. The Laptops while current in our 2016 are obsolete with the Alien technology used in all other applications. Or perhaps Dell just didn't try to acquire any interface? How did we reverse engineer their technology so quickly anyways? It likely would be based on elements and science we'd have no understanding of and just because we have it doesn't mean we can use it.The Alien spaceship flies way way too close to the moon. Like practically scrapes it. This of course has no impact on its orbit.There is basically world peace however the United States seems to control the orbital weapon satellites? And China seems to an invited partner. And the rest of the world just seems OK with this?The alien ship is so big with a diameter of 3000 miles and 20x bigger than the 1996 ships. That the weight would likely weigh as much as the moon. Even if the moon had a controlled landing on Earth. The weight would be enough to destroy the orbit and rotation of the earth and it being well past the height of the atmosphere it would likely destroy the atmosphere also. The ship is way too big.A 1980's Caprice Classic Station Wagons as great as they were had a muffler that was about 6"" from the pavement. It couldn't drive for long under at least a foot of water as we see the kids driving through a Tsunami soaked area.The attack on the alien ship just seemed weak and boring.The Aliens apparently breach a bunker know as Cheyenne Mountain. This a deep level bunker that is holding the president deep underground. The aliens walk in as if its on the ground. No battle. No video battle. Just one moment they land the next the president says ""there will be no peace"" as the Aliens enter. They all die. How? Self destruct? Aliens? We just don't know.It was awesome to see the Aliens on their ship however none of their technology should be any different than it was 20 years earlier in 1996 however it seems as if they have upgraded also. This makes no sense as their civilization is probably a million years old.At one point they steal some Alien fighters. My question is how as they were very clearly taken over by the control tower in the original movie yet now they can not only steal them but also dog fight in them like they've flown in them before. After they escape they fly casually as if there is no more threat. Except clearly the big ship has weapons that could blow them out of the sky. The Queen Alien surviving a close detonation of multiple fusion detonation because she has her own shield is just plain convenient. Too convenient. Her having a huge gun is even more so convenient.The queen has the ability to take control of the fighter ships. Yet when the two hijacked alien fighter ships are attacking her she doesn't crash those ones to the ground. Later the queen takes over all the fighter ships including the ones hijacked to make a protective swarm. They are then able to turn on the Thrusters to some how escape her control. Then they fly back down and start shooting her and she doesn't have the swarm to protect her? At the end the massive Alien ship takes off. With out a Queen? We know that the soldier aliens don't die when she dies as they fought them for 10 years in Africa after the 1996 one was destroyed. But they stop drilling and working when she dies? If they have the ability to take off in this Alien ship then why do they also not have the ability to attack Earth and seek vengeance? Why not self destruct?The ending is worthy of an original Star Trek episode where they all stand around and laugh. Instead it ends with a clear assumption that there will be a sequel and that they will bring the fight to them. Its possible that the ending is the worst part of it. It quickly ends instead of a few minutes more say 1 year later where we see the devastation of the attack. Learn a death toll. Basically a mention of whatever happened during the entire movie. Thats it. I am sure I missed some more things as I wrote these nitpicks and observations. But I think this is enough. Check out my other reviews."
" Special effects and action good, story meh...
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,7,"Independence Day: Resurgence is pretty much what I expected. Actually, given all the negative reviews floating around, it is almost better than what I expected. As is almost always the case, all the 1 and 2 star ratings and ""worst movie ever"" reviews are pure bullshit. The biggest advantage the original movie had was the novelty of it all. This movie is really pretty much the same except for the special effects being even bigger to the extent that they are somewhat over the top at times and the plot somewhat thinner. Having said the latter, the original movie did not really have much in terms of plot either and the nonsense of giving a totally alien computer a virus was so bad it really dragged down the movie.In the relatively short timespan of two decades humanity have improved their technology base by several orders of magnitude (ray guns on the moon etc. etc). The speed of improvement is of course pretty unrealistic, even with access to alien technology, but hey, I can live with that in order to increase the coolness factor of the movie.Then comes an alien ship. Not the aliens we all expected by another one. The ship is totally different from the previous ones, do not seem aggressive but of course dumbass politicians manage to screw everything up. Fast forward a couple of scenes and the ""real"" aliens arrive. Of course this time they have a bigger flyswatter and they perfunctorily proceed to swat away the puny, extremely slow firing, little ray guns of the humans and we are back to where we started in the original movie. Huge space ship parks on Earth, time for plan B.Well there were quite a few scenes of big space ships, destruction and mayhem before the aliens finally manage to park their spaceship. I guess finding a parking space for a 5 000 kilometer space ship can be a bit tricky (I though I had an issue with my Jeep). Here is were I have quite some gripes about the movie. The special effects are cool, no question about it, but they are also exaggerated and throws any attempt to be remotely adhering to the laws of physics out the window. It is clear that whatever low intelligence storywriter that wrote that garbage flunked science classes in school, if he ever got that far of course. For instance, we have a 5 000 kilometer (the Earth radius is about 6 370 kilometer) that is big enough to generate its own gravity (apparently the engines somehow contributed to this) flies in and lands on earth. When it approaches items on the surface, cars, trains, ships, skyscrapers and bits and pieces of the Earth itself starts to fly upwards. It makes for cool effects but anyone with a mediocrum of intelligence ought to realize that such a force would actually destabilize Earth itself. Possibly change the speed of rotation as well as the orbit around the sun.The story is full of other typical Hollywood stupidities and plot holes. Christ even my kids could spot the plot holes which were often big enough to drive a battleship through! As for the acting. Well, I would say there is not too much to say about it. Most of the main actors managed to make it through the movie without screwing up too badly. Given that it was not the deepest or thought provoking movie one could imagine I would say that was good enough. The best character in my opinion was Judd Hirsch as Julius Levinson. The worst one was probably Dr. Okun. Not that Brent Spiner was making a bad job of representing him but the character was just to crazed out for my taste.Okay, I will stop whining now. This movie was pretty much exactly what I expected. Great special effects tied together with a paper thin story. I went into it hoping that the effects were going to be good with little expectations on the rest and that is exactly what I got. The movie fulfilled my expectations completely and thus I consider it worth 7 out of 10 stars. I enjoyed the two hours watching it."
" A spectacular failure!
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,2,"This movie fails on so many counts. Almost whatever you think of, it fails on that.Ironically it could have been a really good movie and that is what makes it so disappointing. It has all the elements in place. And it has some interesting concepts: an intergalactic war, an ally in the fight against the invaders, and attempts to crack the language of the aliens. But they really blew it.Much of the movie reminds me of those cheap cartoons with the angular drawing and boring scripts that they used to show after school on TV. If you picture the movie looking like one of these animations then suddenly it makes more sense. The key must be to have drastically lowered expectations.Many of the younger actors are very photogenic and it makes you wonder if they were chosen for their looks instead of their acting ability. And could they make the AI more boring? If that represents evolution beyond the biological then it's pretty pathetic evolution.This is not a movie that you will want to watch in one sitting. If you do then you'll probably have to throw up afterwards. Watch it in a few sittings on Netflix for slices of mindless diversion."
" ""Independence Day"": Core Values
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,9,"By Seth Shostak, Senior AstronomerThey're baaaaack. Just when you thought humanity's future was already dimmed with tough problems like climate change, terrorism and reality TV, bad guys from a distant planet show up to ruin everyone's whole summer. It's ""Independence Day: Resurgence.""What's the deal? It seems that the invading aliens, with their ugly praying mantis heads and restless flagella for swatting flies, are here for... our planet's core. That's right: They've come to pump out the Earth.Two decades ago these same aggressive aliens swooped down on our planet like space-faring locusts, to stripmine our resources and obliterate life. Not the gentlest of agendas for sure. One of the truly memorable lines in the original ""Independence Day"" was uttered when the U.S. president, clearly discomfited by the havoc and destruction, asked these unattractive creatures ""What do you want us to do?"" The answer was both candid and concise: ""Die."" Bummer. But twenty years later, getting rid of us is not what drove them to drive here. They want Earth's core as an energy source for their spacecraft.Now that's an interesting idea that might qualify as the mother of all fracking schemes. But what in Earth's core could interest these interstellar insectoids anyway? Is there some terrific source of energy hunkered down in our planet's hot-and-heavy center?Well, since the 1930s we've known that there are actually two cores down there, imaginatively known as the inner and the outer. Both are mostly metal — iron and nickel. Thanks to the pressure of all that's above it, the inner core is a solid sphere about 1500 miles in diameter. It's a hot, supersized cannonball that would be difficult to pump out, for sure. Imagine trying to get the pit out of an avocado with a hypodermic needle.The outer core, a gooey layer roughly 1,400 miles thick that surrounds the inner core, is liquid and less dense. Not liquid like water of course, but more akin to the hot magma that oozes out of volcanoes. It's this layer — one presumes — that is the target of the aliens' unauthorized drilling project.But how do you power your interstellar spacecraft with molten metal? Iron, it turns out, is the most stable of the elements — you can't fission it or fuse it. But of course there is all that heat energy, given that the outer core is a scalding 7,000 F or more. You can compute just how much heat energy we're talking about using nothing more than freshman physics, and it works out to 800 thousand joules per pound.Admittedly, that's not a number you'll be bandying about at the water cooler, but I urge you to compare it to the energy per pound of regular-test gasoline, which is 22 million joules.In other words, this is more than a misguided alien attempt to purloin low-test fuel from Earth: they're going for no-test.Clearly, this doesn't make too much sense. (Which could be said of the aliens' military technologies, too. But there's no time for that now.)Then again, let's be fair: There aren't many movie-goers who expect ""Independence Day"" to be an extra credit exercise in STEM education. And frankly, leaving aside all the funky science, the cosmic-scale visual imagery of this sci-fi potboiler is worth the admission. For fans of the original film, there's the pleasure of seeing the always- compelling Brent Spiner topped by his now-trademark Leonardo da Vinci hairdo. And everyone can enjoy the offhand personality of Jeff Goldblum who, I note, is still able to amble double-jointed into any scene.Undoubtedly you'll sleep better at night knowing that Earth's core — while handy for keeping our planet's magnetic field going — is unlikely bait for mucus-riddled visitors from afar. Just keep them away from your local service station.================= Relay's comment: Wouldn't the molten metal be something attractive?"
" Honestly, not any worse than the first
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,6,"So, I waited and waited and waited to watch this movie due to the god awful reviews I had been reading. But one night, mid winter, I was at Redox and nothing sounded good, so I decided it was time to put all hesitation aside and give it a shot. Honestly, my hopes were so low that I ended up enjoying it so much more than I ever thought. It was big, dumb, loud, stupid, cheesy, the acting was borderline SyFy channel, but god was it fun to watch. The returning characters were such a nostalgic pleasure. Jeff Goldblum seemed to be just barely putting in the minimum amount of effort, but seeing him up against aliens again twenty years later brought me right back to my six year old self, watching the first ID on VHS. Judd Hirsch and Bill Pullman were so entertaining and seemed to just be there to have fun. Hirsch a little bit more. Brent Spiner i could have definitely done without. He was too campy and too over the top, but luckily doesn't have too much screen time that it would ruin the film for me. William Fichtner is a highly under rated actor who is in dire need of a new agent, and I always enjoy seeing him pop up here and there. Over all, if you're in your mid twenties like me and remember being a little kid watching the first movie in your pajamas on a Saturday morning, you'll have a great time taking a trip down memory lane. P.S. Did not miss Will Smith."
" this is basically a remake
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"Why remake the original movie, but without will smith and use the same aliens. What's the point? The original had it's problems, but at least it had it's charms. This was just a cash grab, and American audiences stayed away. I can't image what they will do for part 3, they can't have the alien arrive again with even bigger ships can they? I certainly hope not."
" Whoever wrote this script is obviously inexperienced
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,1,"Telling dialogue, cheesy jokes, terrible characters that are more like marionettes filling in stereotypes then actual people with motivations. The first Independence day gave us an interesting cast that experienced the stages of the attack from their own unique POV with varying stories. What you get here is a bunch of hogwash that feels like a bad copy cat of the first movie with bad writing involved. Save your money and your dignity. Watch this on a Sunday night when you have nothing else to do . . . or just watch the trailer, the movie might just ruin your week. 1/10"
" The bigger they are ...
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,3,"You can take that to the bank and also take it literally. But yes, I don't think expectations were that high for a sequel to a movie from 20 years ago. And while I wouldn't consider myself the biggest Will Smith fan (acting wise that is), his (film) son should get back to (acting) school. And I hope he hasn't quit his day job yet ... I know that may sound mean, and maybe there is hope for him still, but charisma wise there was less than nothing on screen.But saying the movie didn't work because of one actor would be unfair. It's also the script, let's keep it real here. There are entertaining moments from time to time, especially when you recognize recurring characters (there are a couple of them and no the dog could not come back, I'm sorry!). But it also is riddled with a lot of mental and crazy things that are just too much. Or you'll love the whole wink wink, the world is ending but we're making dad and son jokes kind of vibe. I for one and apparently a lot of others did not approve ..."
" Not bad
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,6,"Well, i have seen many bad reviews of the films however the movie wasn't that bad to watch if you just want to see some visual effects scenes with planes fight and aliens ships , nothing else than these action fight scene with alien plans and ship to review in the film i rate it 6/10 (not bad)"
" kind of boring generic cgi American film
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,2,"it's the classic boring American film where it's full of cgi, they present Americans as the people who save the world (even though in the film they claimed that the whole world works together now but apparently Americans are the heroes of the world), and they even have to have Jewish characters to try to push the idea that jews are such great people onto everybody, like so many American TV shows and films seem to be obliged to do. The plot is stupid and boring and the cgi is boring."
" Too many cooks spoiled the script with lots of CG & little emotion
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,4,"This movie is a real let down from it's predecessor, which I own because I enjoyed it so much. As with many action movies today, there is little humor, romance, or character development to get you caring about the characters and their story. CG is totally overdone in this movie in fact it was the movie. Characters are totally dwarfed by technology, another reason why showing their humanness could have made a difference.When will Hollywood get the message that bigger isn't necessarily better? That you still need humor, romance, great characters, and a great story to get a hit. Writing by committee just doesn't work."
" My Rating is -10 (minus ten)
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,1,"Don't even want to bother listing everything that is wrong with this movie -- there is not enough space for such a listing here. If this is not the bottom of the Hollywood's cinematographic idiocy, then it must be somewhere, somehow below the bottom.There is not a single redeeming quality to this flick. Never expected any, though.The worst part is probably all this rehashing of the ideas, scenes, concepts from other movies. And, yes, it was so painful to listen to all those celebratory and troops-rallying speeches. Oh, the speeches! How they love to show all this cheap ""brave"" talk!Scientifically and logically this one is simply below the lowest possible expectations. Shows that the Hollywood producers and directors seriously think that the movie-going public has mentally degraded to the level of some single-cell organisms.BTW, with all those supposed technological advances, how come that the cars, the radios, the school buses, the TVs, the houses are still all the same? How come that the humanity that was just recently brought down to the literal stone-age level and then fought a total war was able to return to a completely normal, highly developed state of existence after those mere twenty years? Everything at all appears absolutely like there was no war and no total infrastructural destruction since ever! ...Also, first, the ""alien"" weapons keep not having any effect on the aliens and then they start having the devastating effect; a guy with two panga knives is more effective than the ""alien"" weapons, when it appears convenient for the ""plot"" of this flick.Why that white sphere did not communicate its intentions earlier (before appearing as a threat and getting shot down)? Why it had to be touched first? What? It just liked to be touched or something? And if the ""good virtual aliens"" who built the white sphere are so dangerous to the ""bad aliens"", then why did they need to ""teach"" someone else how to fight the ""bad aliens"" instead of using that destructive knowledge themselves? Why couldn't they protect themselves in the first place? Sounds exactly like ""get rich fast -- ask me how. send me $20 first, though"" (like, if you know how to get rich fast, then why do you need my $20 now, instead of already becoming rich yourself?).If the entire control of the ""alien hive"" depends upon this single ""mother"" creature, then why would she want to expose herself to a significant danger? Sounds simply dumb.All the ""alien"" weapons still look like rifles and cannons. No creativity there.Why the captured ""aliens"" were kept in such great numbers? Also, why were they allowed to stay within their bio-armor suits that offered such excellent protection? Does anyone capture an enemy tank crew and then allows them to remain inside their tank?The movie is disgustingly audience-targeted at the Chinese teenagers of the lowest intellectual denomination (lots of Chinese people are way smarter than to watch this sort of trash). Many reviewers here noticed it with the same disgust.What puzzled me was that Chinese Lunar base ""commander"" who barely spoke any good English, and who so harshly reprimanded the tug pilot (played by Liam Hemsworth, if I am not mistaken) for SAVING the whole Lunar base and the expensive defense weapon! I also noticed that not a SINGLE person at the base cheered the guy who just saved everyone - there was not a flick of positive emotion. Everybody droned about their daily duties as though nothing happened. This just could not be. It could not be a human reaction to such an event. Personnel of the entire base could not be programmed or remotely controlled by that chicken-droppings ""commander""! The script writers must be pathologically emotionally shallow and depraved individuals.The CGI and the props were not all that good either. Many CGI scenes looked like takeouts from some cheesy video game. Like I noticed already, the cars were all present-day models. The weapons were quite uninventively designed. Also, why the ""alien"" weapons were so perfectly ergonomically built as to be used by humans with no difficulty or modification? The ""aliens"" in their armored suits appeared quite different from the humans. This was just dull.Really, I just can't go on talking about this absolutely shameless attempt at making a movie. Too bad about so many good actors who had to play in it. I am sure they were all completely desperate for money, so they basically prostituted their names and their reputations by ""starring"" in this garbage.I am very sorry for those people who missed the 4th of July events in order to attend the premiere of this trash of a movie. They were obviously cheated out of their money, their time, and their patriotic celebration, but there is no point to be saying ""I want my money back"". No one gives any money back for bad movies. ""Caveat Emptor""! And just quit expecting any kind of quality from this sort of Hollywood production already! There are directors who are never any good. Seriously. Stop throwing your money away to support such horrible products, folks! At best, if you really have to, watch such stuff on pay-per-view with some friends."
" About what I expected...
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,6,"I liked the first Independence Day movie more than the most people (judging by the IMDb rating) and the same is true for this one. That said, this film is not particularly good. The special effects are adequate but, considering that 20 years have passed, are not any more effective than those in the original. I didn't watch in 3D, so perhaps the endless swirling 'debris' scenes were lost on me. The acting basically combined the shtick from the first one (Goldblum, Spiner and Hirsch) with currently obligatory young, reckless, rebel-hero stereotypes. The ending is a painful setup for #3, which I will no doubt watch, despite, I suspect, its continuing the usual downhill sequel slide. Too bad, I really like giant spaceship stories."
" Unintentionally Hilarious
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,1,"Roland Emmerich is a very unstable kind of man, he can do a tremendous film like Day After Tomorrow, or then he can create a terribly poor flick as 2012, or this sequel to Independence Day. This is a typical butch of what can be done wrong to make it even more terrible. All the awful clichés are here, and I will not retell them so that not to reveal plot lines. All I can say is that the whole array of good actors and all the bunch of excellent FX do not save this shambles of a movie from being suddenly funny. Whenever the plot tries to be tragic or serious or deep, it turns out to be hilarious, silly, shallow, trite or even downward stupid. Emmerich is at his worst here, and his attempts of creating a decent Sci-Fi movie all break against the rocks of pathetic failure. You can watch this idiocy for laughs just once and then forget altogether"
" They had twenty years to come up with something good
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,2,"and they came up with this? And because the Chinese are now investor owners they force feed us the slutty Chinese bimbo in the film?? I'm not insulting high art here so it doesn't pain me when I say Independence Day 2 isn't on the level established by the original. The first one had some standout moments. The sequel simply does not. America has become a repetitious place including an alien robot who is dumb.One of the more recognizable mainstream actors - Goldbloom - appears in so many dumb scenes one wonders. The forced Chinese woman has enormous boobs (hahahaha not really) would certainly be a treat to see at a circus ... carnival ... anywhere. A second segment with her is drinking Chinese rations. At least the film is short, again not really."
" Only a few things worth noting
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,1,"(1) The dog had really strange eyes; (2) The studio saved money by reusing Fred Armisen's ""Candace"" (of ""Women and Women First"" notoriety) wig and costume from ""Portlandia"" on the Brent Spiner character; (3) Were the school kids supposed to be a nod to ""Bob's Burgers"". . . I was confused by the rabbit ear hats;(4) What was the Filipino dude (toward the end of the movie) doing hanging out with the Bedouins in the middle of the desert?(5) How were the kids able to drive the Mercury Colony Park station wagon through water that came up to its undercarriage?Quite frankly, I had a very hard time reaching ten lines for this review. The movie is that un-memorable."
" A splurge of digital nonsense that cares about nothing but filling its pockets
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,2,"By the time the 300-mile wide alien spacecraft appears in the skies and touches down on our world, it had become quite clear that Independence Day: Resurgence, the belated sequel to the beloved 1996 disaster movie, was here simply for our money. For anyone expecting anything else but lifeless CGI akin to a video-game cut-scene and actors with less charisma than the beers I felt myself needing to consume throughout this complete waste of time and money will be sorely disappointed, but hardly surprised. The original Independence Day was just as daft and just as stupid, yet it had a charming innocence about it, which possibly stemmed from the sight of famous landmarks being obliterated before 9/11 made it slightly uncomfortable to watch some mindless carnage. It also had Will Smith, who probably read the script for Resurgence and decided that it was so bad that he opted to do Suicide Squad instead.Just like in real life, 20 years have past since those gigantic spaceships destroyed a host of major cities before being taken down by the combined efforts of... well, America. Just like in Alan Moore's Watchmen, the devastation caused by the alien race has brought humanity together, putting their differences aside to fight a common enemy. There's also been some amazing leaps in technology thanks to the debris left by the alien crafts, and a space station on the moon acts as humanity's first line of defence against another invasion. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) is now one of the top figures in alien research, and when he meets up with African war- lord Umbutu (Deobia Oparei) in 'Central Africa', discovers that the defeated aliens sent a telepathic distress signal to their home planet 20 years ago. Umbutu receives some of these messages due to his close encounters with the creatures, as does former President Thomas Whitmore (Bill Pullman) and Dr. Brakish Okun (Brent Spiner).Of the new arrivals, there's the cocky and hunky hot-shot pilot Jake Morrison who, when we first meet him, is using his cockiness and hunkyness to save the space station from catastrophe. He is played by Liam Hemsworth, an actor I find utterly boring even in his better roles, who is clearly here for an easy payday since the script requires him to do little more than shout a defiant ""aaaaaaaagh!"" every time he faces danger in the cockpit. Jake is caught in some kind of squabble with Dylan Hiller (Jessie T. Usher), the son of Will Smith's character in the first film. Independence Day turned the Fresh Prince of Bel- Air into one the most bankable A-listers in the business, but Resurgence certainly won't be doing the same for Usher. He is one of many forgettable new faces in a packed ensemble which also includes President Whitmore's daughter (Maika Monroe), the current lady President (Sela Ward), the competent General Adams (William Fichtner), and Levinson's former flame Dr. Catherine Marceaux (Charlotte Gainsbourg in one of the greatest ever ""what the hell am I doing here?"" performances).While I recognise that development only occurred sporadically throughout the last 20 years, the best that the 5 (yes, 5) screenwriters behind Independence Day: Resurgence could come up with is to simply remake virtually everything that came before. There are shots of people gazing into the sky, landmarks turning into balls of flame, a dog-fight during which the enemies' weakness is exposed, a rousing Presidential speech which Pullman half-arses here, and Jeff Goldblum doing his Jeff Goldblum thang. The Force Awakens (2015) was criticised for doing the same, but at least it introduced a whole new bunch of likable characters and exciting set-pieces to distract us from this obvious flaw. Here, we get wise-cracks by Jake as millions of people die around him, and a climax that feels like the boss level from a computer game. And all without Will Smith. Simply put, Roland Emmerich's sequel is a boring, soulless ejaculation of digital nonsense that cares about nothing but filling its pockets with the cash of the unsuspecting."
" Extremely forced Hollywood popcorn - with on-screen stroke
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,6,"Weak sci fi sequel (see 'remake') of 96's half decent Independence Day where the aliens are bigger, the guns louder, and the CGI shinier.I'm not entirely sure why, beyond profit, Hollywood thought this film was ever necessary. I mean technically I guess I've just answered my own question, but even then, this was a truly pointless exercise in movie-making which might not have been diabolical, but truly was an average affair in story telling and a dreadful one in acting (more on that later).In short those alien dudes are back. Only this time it's actually...for the exact same reason as before with some idiotic mumbo jumbo about another alien race. A great deal of returns are seen, with huge cheques clearly waved in aging faces with reprises of Goldlum's Levinson, Hursh's 'his dad', Pullman's president, Spiner's Okun, while the marquee name of Will Smith had much better things to do so they got Chris Hemsworth to be the 'underated hero'.The above do their best to try to take this rubbish seriously and in all fairness make a fair fist of it, but it's the curious decision to cast art-house 'legend' Charlotte Gainsbourg in the role of 'Jeff Goldblum's ex' which puzzles the most. Her style of delivery may work in the subterranean world of abstract cinema, but in this epic it was like watching a child struggling with an ongoing stroke - the woman could barely deliver her lines, speaking slower than someone with a genuine impediment, completely at contrast with the furious pace Emerich's direction was going at and that of whatever poor fool she was playing opposite in any given scene was. It was painful and it absolutely destroyed every moment she spoke.Jessie T Usher was the replacement 'token black guy to replace Will Smith' and he actually did a reasonable job of not being too jingoistically goofy but was betrayed by an atrocious 'close encounters' 'gag'.Special effects were pretty good, but with the budget thrown at this that's not surprising, and the thinly fleshed subplots (two enemy heroes become friends, nerd becomes warrior, other nerd tries to get the girl, and creepy old man takes in a group of 15 year olds for no apparent reason) both strain and plain confuse.And yet for all the patent rubbishness of the plot, the acting, the forced nonsense before us which is basically Independence Day 2016, it is still weirdly quite entertaining. Emerich's aforementioned direction is fast, slick, and does a good job of keeping our attention while those shiny CGI this and thats entertain our eyes if not our brain.In terms of substance, this is a zero. It's is horrendous. But it's stylish silly substance which may have absolutely no brain and barely a believable heart but it has lungs and eyes which somehow make it work.It's Hollywood blockbuster nonsense by the numbers yet somehow it works. Just."
" Horrible
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,1,"Worst possible movie. Whether Will Smith was in it or not, it's a weak attempt of a sequel. The new actors were horrible. The old actors were suppressed by a whack story line. I'm truly disappointed. I'm happy I didn't see it in theaters. I cant believe it was the same Directors from the original film. They tried to hard to outdo themselves that they got lost in the shadows of the original.The Asian female had no remorse about losing her dad.Vivica Fox died very stupid and her son seemed to forget about her death at the end of the movie.They entered the belly of the mother ship and was able to pee and escape. In the original 'David' constantly worried about his dad however he had no care whatsoever this time around.The new President had nothing to her / him.This movie will scar your original experience."
" Oh The Horror
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,1,"Ooh the critics were right. I'd heard the negative reviews of this movie while it was in its infancy in theaters and whereas I didn't totally ignore them I didn't totally believe them either. Now I have watched. I have looked into the bright sun though I was told not to and my sight has been snatched away from me. Now I seek independence from the mental torture that I was put through for the past two hours.As far as big budget movies go--this is the worst I've seen since... well since San Andreas, but San Andreas wasn't riding the coattails of a successful first installment. It was like they didn't even try on any level. Almost like, ""Hey, we killed it with Independence Day so all we have to do is roll out some drivel with the same title and we'll make tons of dough again.""This movie had it all: terrible acting, atrocious script, comical special effects (like it was still 1996), inane plot and did I mention the acting? Every actor was some generic automaton. And if they weren't some type of Stepford actor they were way over the top. This movie was quite literally the same one as in 1996 but bigger and more irritating. There were many of the same original characters in the same exact roles (besides Will Smith who wisely refrained from this farce) down to the similar ""inspirational"" speeches (at least they saved money on the script).ID:R was unoriginal, unimaginative, uncreative and largely unwatchable. I can't believe I found myself rooting for the aliens. At least if they wiped mankind out there would be no way to make another sequel (which they left the door open to). I can't criticize this movie enough and it deserves all the criticism it gets. If this review was a text message I'd add the poop emoji with flies buzzing around it. Agh! I'm so upset. And someone may ask, ""Why would you be upset at a movie?"" Two reasons: 1.) As has been stated by many before me: that's two hours of my life I can't get back and 2.) They just went and crapped on a very memorable movie. Why? Why resurrect something that needed no revival? One thing is for certain; whether it's next year or another 20 years from now, I will NOT be watching another Independence Day. Shoot, this movie dang near ruined the actual holiday itself."
" Disappointed
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,1,"I have noticed an epidemic hitting Hollywood. You know that saying ""Too much of a good thing?"" That's exactly what's going on in the movie industry. Where the focus is mostly on the WOW factor of special effects. Though special effects is the blood of a movie (no pun intended) it isn't the heart of a film. The heart of a film is the story line, dialogue, characters, movie scores, and the build up in the film that makes it stand out from the rest. That is how you take a script and turn it into a masterpiece film! This was the focus of Hollywoods in the past, but it has been lost over the years through the ever growing CGI demand in film. A little bit of CGI is great and easier for the creators. But when you start ignoring the true value of a movie, that's when you start getting ratings like mine and others. As soon as I turned the movie on and heard the opening score I was worried. Music plays a BIG part in a motion picture. It gives the audience the emotional feelings of the characters and movie. Helping the audience connect with each scene. For example John Williams opening credits score for Star Wars. It helped to make the film popular. It was a strong and grand opening for the film and prepared a platform for an amazing movie. That was NOT presented in this film. In the first film the music was strong, patriotic, and you knew you were about to experience a piece of movie history. I was 14 when I say Independence Day in the theater and it was an awesome experience! David Arnold did a great job on the music, but on this movie it was missing the emotion from the first film. Independence Day had humor, strength, and action that kept you on the edge of your seats. I just didn't find that in this film expect from actor Judd Hirsch who still seemed to have his character intact from the last film. Otherwise I just felt like the acting was OK. The new characters didn't seem to relate at all to the last movie and the existing actors seemed as though they didn't want to be there. They were lacking the emotions they expressed in the first film. It was kinda sad to see and was disappointing. Now the movie takes place 20 years later in the year 2016. My boyfriend and I were a little thrown off by the technology that was presented in the film. It wasn't relatable to today's technology and wasn't ever really explained. Where did this technology come from? Did we learn it from the aliens? If we had an explanation maybe it would have made more sense. I think it would have been smarter to have based the movie in the real 2016. My generation would have been more excited and the new generation would have loved it as well. Going big doesn't always mean better. The aliens came into the movie to fast, the story line was everywhere, yet not there at all, and I couldn't relate with the characters. I laughed, but not because it was funny. I laughed because it was lazy. It was lazily executed and was suppose to WOW us more, then enlighten us. This movie could have been much better. Maybe even better then the first."
" A poor sequel to a great original. 3/10
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,3,"Review: This was one of the most anticipated movies this year but once Will Smith left the project, everyone's expectations went down. With Liam Hemsworth taking the lead as Jake Morrison, which was a terrible choice in my eyes, and Dylan Hiller (Jessie T. Usher) playing Will Smith's son, I really struggled to stay awake through this movie, and I personally wasn't that impressed with the acting. Jeff Goldblum (David Levinson) looked like he didn't want to be there most of the time, and Bill Pullman just looked like a right mess. The director tried to enter some complex elements to the plot, which went straight over my head, and I found the music throughout the movie, REALLY annoying. On the plus side, some of the CGI does look great, and the action scenes looked realistic but the alien looked to much like the Queen in the Alien franchise. Anyway, the movie is set 20 years in the future from the last alien attack, and America decides to build a space station called the ESD (Earth Space Defence) which is stationed on Earth, the Moon and Mars. The Aliens return to invade earth to cause mass destruction, after a distress signal was sent to them before they were defeated 20 years earlier, so the ESD have to use all of there power to defeat them. Bill Pullman (Whitmore), is no longer the president, and suffers with depression whilst his daughter Patricia (Maika Monroe) works for the ESD. During the attack from the aliens, Whitmore decides to take matters into his own hands, with the help of his daughter, while Jake and Dylan are fighting against the Aliens spaceships. There are other elements to the story but it just seemed like a load of technical jargon to me. Personally, I think the film was way too long and it seemed to drag after a while. There are a lot of unnecessary scenes and there wasn't much depth to the characters, who seemed to be dropping like flies throughout the movie. I also found it to cheesy and not that entertaining, and the so-called wit in the script, really wasn't that great. The new characters was a bad choice by the director and they didn't add anything new to the franchise, so I think you can tell that it gets the thumbs down from me. Disappointing!Round-Up: I think that this movie made a hefty profit at the box office, mainly because of the first movie, which I can watch time and time again. It was directed by Roland Emmerich, 61, who also brought you Universal Soldier, Stargate, Independence Day, Godzilla, The Patriot, The Day After Tomorrow, 10,000 BC, 2012, Anonymous, White House Down and Stonewall. He's obviously had a lot of experience behind the camera, so I'm surprised that he made a right mess of this movie. As he directed the first Independence Day, I thought he would have realised that the reason why it was so popular, was because of the witty aspect of the movie, which really didn't work in this film. With another Independence Day in the pipeline, I just hope that they bring something new to the table, because it feels like the franchise is going in the wrong direction.Budget: $165million Worldwide Gross: $390millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/sci-fi movies, starring Liam Hemsworth, Maika Monroe, Jeff Goldblum, Jessie T. Usher, Bill Pullman, William Fichtner and Judd Hirsch. 3/10"
" Brilliant, brave, original, engaging, deep, and beautiful...
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,1,"...are all words that can never be used to describe this film.This movie lacks any of the qualities of a good film, but does contain several qualities of a bad hooker- cheap, lazy, covered in make up, desperate for money, and on the whole rather tragic.There is nothing exciting about this film. It literally repeats as much from the original film as possible, right down to actually remaking some of the exact same shots and sequences! The plot too is almost exactly the same as the first film, except there is an incredibly facile and over-used deus ex machina that swoops in and saves the day in the end.The characters are 90% cliché and the rest is just hinged on a prayer that the actor's good looks will make you like them enough to keep watching as they spout off redundant and tortured Hollywood tropes with agonising frequency.But, for me, this was not the worst part. The worst part was the utterly inappropriate injection of Hollywood's political opinions into the plot, in the following ways: 1. The president sounds suspiciously like Hillary Clinton.2. There are female characters that exist seemingly just to fill a quota of female actors as they offer absolutely nothing to the plot.3. The US army is made up of a rainbow of colours and creeds to reflect the fact that in the Utopian future (under Hillary Clinton) there is true equality! Hilariously, however, for all of its condescending politicising, it STILL somehow manages to be incredibly racist! The African allies are depicted as a kind of 'hooga-booga!' screaming primitive tribe, who despite possessing alien technology in a supposedly unified world, still carry machetes and have a sort of 'animal' understanding of the aliens.And it also makes a subtle but incredibly insulting jab at Jews too- for when the aliens are about to slaughter our imitation Hillary, she bravely declares 'there will be no peace', which is of course a reference to the rhetoric of Palestine towards Israeli settlement-building. And with that single sentence therefore strongly implies that the monstrous aliens who want to steal the earth basically equate to Israeli Jews. Which is as offensive as it is ignorant.Personally I'm very tired of Hollywood's insipid narcissism in thinking it can lecture everyone on moral absolutism because it has money. I wish Emmerich had put more effort into making a half-decent film and less effort into trying to offer the public a cheap blow-job of a movie in return for cash.It says what it thinks you want to hear, shows you what it thinks you want to see, and yet somehow this film manages to be the exact opposite of appealing."
" Great action packed film Look forward to part 3!
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"I gave this movie a 4.5 for the same reason I gave part I the same rating, which I will mention below. First however I want to say that the blue ray version is excellent, colors are very nice, the sound mixing also good (although it could have made more use of that DTS-HD as some other films have such as the jungle book who truly utilized the surround channels effectively and noticeably. The set designs are beautifully rendered whether in the Area 51 bases or the alien mother ship (the concept of a alien ecosystem inside the mother ship was a nice touch, well done!), the examples of alien technology transforming the world was very well done, the mention of anti-gravity space crafts, and architecture is thought provoking, well done for giving us something to ponder. I would love to see more CGI in the next film, although the CGI in this film was money well spent and is glorious to look out (compliments to all the parties responsible, fantastic job!), The story line is very good, new twists and elements that I did not expect (and believe me I have seen just about everything and read everything so for you to surprise me is definitely a good thing, this is regarding the special surprise in the film, the rest of you will have to see the film to find out I am not going to tell you what it is but its good!)Okay this part for the Director Roland Emmerich please take note: As I mentioned the dialogue that the presidents make are cheesy, corny and propaganda-ish, please for part 3 while writing the screenplay with Woods, Devlin and Vanderbilt just take a closer look at how the real politicians, presidents talk regarding real world crisis and conflicts, its all pretty serious and straight forward, when inspirational speeches are made they touch on real issues and to the heart of the people. Besides that the story is well put together Goldblum's character mentions ""We're taking the fight to them"" Wow!, I look forward to part 3 and the element I spoke about above needs to be fully explored by Brent Spiner's character is very promising. I do hope you will get rid of that long hair, have him, Goldblum, Hemsworht, Fichtner and Pullman as well as Monroe's, and Jessie Usher's character's make the journey to battle the aliens. Do have Spiner's character be more intelligent and show us a more serious analytical scientist as he make his theories and test them, you can keep the goofiness but please just execute it intelligently to guarantee chuckles or laughs (he can pull both the intelligence and humor off, after all he was data in Star trek next generation). Fichtner and Pullman were both excellent please have Pullman somehow return in part 3 yes, and also the neurosis or anxiety can be handled better, with more finesse it will improve the presentation. Fichtner also handled his role excellently he needs to be leading the charge to battle the aliens, steals the movie with his performance. Sela Ward makes a great Madamme President,she has a presence that is compelling and interesting, bring her back in part 3. She also holds the key to exploit a very important part of the film that the world has come together and works as one to improve the human condition and to touch on how important and great such an event is and how it can lead to the next stage of human evolution, its a familiar theme in famous sci-fi stories but can be expounded on here, especially in part 3. Consequently there seems to me to be enough here if very carefully and artfully done, for a part 4! Goldblum, Hemsworth and Hirsch's characters and performance are great. I would love to see Hirsch's character interacting in more significant and meaningful situations, yet with that witty humor of his, to explain the human reaction to the aliens, or other situations with the kids from part one and making significant discoveries, Goldblum's character is his son so he has been exposed to special knowledge no one else has, this can make his role better. Do keep the humor between Goldblum and Hirsch's characters it works, just ensure that it's smart, witty humor to keep us chuckling, even if in part 3 it may have to be done over video conferencing, since Goldblum's character will be on a spacecraft and on the front lines as he needs to be, along with Hemsworth, Pullman, Fichtner, Spiner, Monroe and Jessie Ushers characters. I would love to see the rivalry between Usher's and Hemsworth characters be resolved and a strong teamwork between them, Monroe, Angela Yeung Wing, Fichtner and Pullman's team as a squadron should be electrifying. Hemsworth character needs to show us why he's the hero by leading the charge, put him in situations where he has to lead a small group of elite fighters into the enemy stronghold along with the other characters mentioned who are all an excellent group and have him share screen time in such a situation with Fichtner, Pullman and the others, on the ground on one of those excellent alien spacecraft sets looking for whatever they need and a throw down battle scene with many of these elite fighters under Pullman, Fichtner's and Hemsworth lead both on ground and leading aerial attacks, this is pure thrills and excitement if done carefully with great attention to details, lines and tight, choreographed battle scenes as you had in this movie. You are definitely on the right track, there is tremendous potential you have here, make it happen! see you in ID3! p.s. Will smith's character should be in part 3 even as a clone or hologram showing up a few times with important information."
" Independence Day: Regurgitation
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,1,"(RATING: ☆)THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.JIM'S REVIEW: They're back! Ten years later in Earth time and twenty years in the future with the dismal sequel, Independence Day: Resurgence comes off life support and into a theater near you. Misdirected by Roland Emmerich and written by a committee of five that included Mr. Emmerich, Dean Devlin, Nicolas Wright, James A. Woods, and James Vanderbilt, the film is a dud.The aliens want revenge again and so will any moviegoer who sits through this dumb sci-fi adventure. The various one dimensional characters are put through their paces as they face perils to undo the invader's plot. And the film's plot defies logic as well. The CGI effects are sub-par, the kind one could easily find in a video game. There is so much mayhem per inch on the screen that it is hard to see the action at times. Lots of sound and explosions with no real impact.Beside the poor writing and dialog that is more endless exposition, there are enough OMG apocalyptic moments that are borderline laughable. As the film battles progress, so does the absurdity, especially when a magic yellow school bus successfully evades an attacking alien mother-lode. Paging Miss Sweeney!The acting is dreadful throughout. Will Smith is wisely DOA in this revival, but Jeff Goldblum, Bill Pullman, William Fichtner, Charlotte Gainsbourg, and Sela Ward are completely wasted in their ill-fitting roles. Judd Hirsch plays his Jewish schtick too thick, as if he is playing Tevye to the last seat in the balcony while Brett Spiner, donning a long gray fright wig, plays a dotty scientist awakened from a 20 year coma. There is another ham in his performance for a sandwich at the Carnegie Deli. Liam Hemsworth relies too much on his good looks to carry him through another film role and Jessie Usher, Maika Monroe, and Travis Tope provide passing interest for the younger crowd.Independence Day: Resurgence is awful, simply one of the worst sequels ever made. Avoid! GRADE: D-"
" What a joke
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,5,Oh my god. 20 years later. That I slept during the movie in the cinemas. on Independence Day 1. I did not understand or follow anything in this movie. It is mainly a science fiction movie. I am not sure if you need to watch the first one to have a clue what's happening. I didn't. It was a complete joke!It was total waste of two hours of my life.I don't know if there was supposed to have a plot or a love story or a continuation from 20 years ago but it did had a lot of action that 9 could not count for
" A solid 2 stars, Not recommended
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,2,"Finding myself one of the biggest fans of the original Independence Day with Will Smith, watching it over and over at least 50+ times with my girlfriend and us celebrating each time, this movie... left me very disappointed.The movie opens with introducing you to the main characters, much like the original did. It seems like an excellent movie at first, with good music, and a scene where a lot of people are saved, and this will get you interested. But... do not have too much hope with this film, because you will probably not enjoy the next sequences so much. The movie is probably the worst movie I have seen in 10 years when it comes to the sci-fi genre.Not recommended, but if you're like me, give it a try regardless, but do not be upset; you have been warned."
" They had twenty years to make a sequel...
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,1,"And they mucked it up!! Worst sequel I've ever seen.Worse than Indiana Jones 4.Terrible story,terrible acting, terrible dialogue no fun, action scenes suck.Liam Hemsworth suck as always.Heroic smart characters from the original reduced to morons stating the obvious every time it has just happened.People using alien technology and especially alien guns is so incredibly stupid and childish. The guy playing Will Smiths son is a joke.Making the hippie scientist from the original a gay man is an insult to the character.None of the actors seemed to care or have any interest in the material what so ever.The second worst part is that, not only does this crap trashes the original, it makes me never wanna watch the original again. And I love the original.Second worst part is: Roland Emmerich who also directed the original clearly dropped the ball on this one.But the worst part is, they wanna make a third movie....In Space.Not even Will Smith could have saved this sh*t!!!!!"
