" Mind-blowing
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,9,"Slightly uneven pacing at the start is more than offset by one of the most mind-blowing and affecting third acts I've seen. Effects, acting, and music all faultless throughout."
" GREATEST
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,10,Writing this review after 6 years of its release and watching it for 20th time. One of those movies that blow your heart mind and soul all at the same time and will stick with you for the rest of your life... If you are an inception fan.. Its ten times better...
" Simply perfect
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,10,"As always, all characteristics of a Nolan's plot are present - complex, mind-bending and multilayered story. That director totally understands the role of good story and superb sound design for the proper effect on the audience. Everythig in that movie seems perfect to me."
" Interstellar is Nolan's best film for a mass viewer
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is Nolan's best film for a mass viewer. A real masterpiece, the film is on the same level with 2001: Kubrick's A Space Odyssey. Great cast and story plot. An excellent ending, which has an open ending, while the viewer receives answers to all questions."
" One of the Best
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,10,"I have never understood the mixed reviews. Make no mistake, for a film with an 8.6/10 rating on here (as of this writing) there is a very vocal crowd that says Interstellar is highly overrated. Some daresay it's simply a bad film.I re-watched this movie for the first time in a few years just to see if I had somehow been bamboozled the first viewing a few years ago. Maybe I had been duped? I wasn't.Interstellar is simply one of the best science fiction films of all time. The story, score, visuals, acting, are all out of this world (sorry for the pun). It's truly an experience. I rarely give out a 10/10 but this one deserved it. It's one of the best from one of the better filmmakers of the last two decades."
" A new gem by Christopher Nolan
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,9,"If you know who is Christopher Nolan you must watch this, you love science fiction you must watch this."
" Christopher Nolan's masterpiece
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar, by Christopher Nolan, is a film set in the dystopian future where Earth is becoming uninhabitable for humans due to the inability to grow crops. The science-fiction epic follows Cooper played by Matthew McConaughey and Brand played by Anne Hathaway as they journey into space in order to save the human race. On Earth the film follows Murph, played by Jessica Chastain, as she attempts to find a solution for the survival of the human race if the space expedition fails.In Interstellar, Christopher Nolan put on screen one of the most visually appealing movies that you'll ever see. On earth, as it is dying, he makes sure that it appears that way. The air is gloomy and the colors he uses are dark in order to show how desperate the situation is. As we follow Cooper and Brand into space, the color palette changes to bright colors, almost signifying hope for the human race. The cinematography is also brilliant. While on Earth, Nolan brilliantly keeps the camera close to the characters in order to make the audience feel as anxious as they are. And in space, Nolan uses wide camera angles that are breathtaking as it shows the beauty of the void. Performances by Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway are captivating as they both make you feel the level of emotion that a person in their circumstance would feel. During the scene where Cooper is watching videos of his children growing up, McConaughey reaches acting brilliance. As he is sobbing watching the videos you no longer feel as if you are watching someone act, you feel as if you are watching someone actually go through what the character is experiencing. Anne Hathaway also portrays her character so well, that as she jeopardizes the entire mission for the love of her life you can't get mad at her. Her performance puts the audience in a tough spot as they have to ask themselves if they would do the same in her situation. Now with saying these things the film has some major flaws for the average viewer. The film's idea and plot, while very thought out and honestly genius, can be very hard to follow along with for someone who isn't going to be fully immersed in the film. Especially in the way that Nolan ends the film, even I who was watching intently, had to rewatch the ending multiple times in order to fully understand what had happened. In saying this overall the movie can only be classified as brilliant. It can be compared to Stanley Kubrick's timeless classic 2001: A Space Odyssey and Gravity directed by Alfonso Cuar√≥n. The dystopian world that Nolan creates is incredibly smart and entertaining. With a run time of over 2 and a half hours I was still fully interested the entire time watching it. The dialogue is emotional and witty, and the performances by the leading actors are extraordinary. In conclusion I believe this movie is a must watch for any person no matter if you are a film school student or a businessman coming home from work."
" Christopher Nolan fan
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,10,"This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 10 out of 10."
" i'd like to rate 11/10
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,10,"The sixth sense meets inception. Makes you cry, sweat, and question your own actions in the face of these scenarios, if you approach the film wholeheartedly and ready for the ride then it will take you on quite a journey, and you'll only want to see it again and again. The music really does the job of keeping you suspended, Anne Hathaway and Jessica chastain do fine work, as does Matthew McConaughey, and the little girl playing a younger Jessica Chastain pulls at your heartstrings. I was really really pleased with this and wish it was getting as much attention and praise as it deserves, i think the writing was genius and it really had my brain working hard. You walk out of the theater and everyone around you is talking about it from the sidewalk to the subway ride home, everyone, it was really funny to see."
" Truly dreadful
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,2,"This film fails at every level; poor physics, poor psychology, necessity for sick bags at every emotional turn. Some of the visuals were ok (hence 2 stars not one), but the sound editor needs sacking, as in key moments the music drowns the words - though why anyone would want to hear the words is beyond me. The dialogue is weak and patronises the audience.Nolan fails again."
" Magnificent!
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,10,"The best movie of Nolan!
A film that is not boring at all, with a very good story and impressive performances."
" Nolan's masterpiece
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,10,In my top 10 of all time great movies. Nolan hit it out of the park with this one. I watch at least once every year. Beautifully shot movie with an incredibly creative storyline. Soundtrack reaches my very soul.
" The most clever and well formed movie I've ever seen.
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie is an incredible experience in and out, the visual effects are the best I've ever seen, the screenplay is genius and heartbreaking, and the acting is one in a lifetime. I know people usually tend to shy away from long movies, thats why it took me so long to come around watching it, but if you are reading the comments to see if it is worth seeing, it is, so go watch it you stupid idiot."
" ""Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here.""
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,10,"This movie has been on my watchlist for years, and I finally got the chance to watch it now. Nolan is a filmmaker that I consider a genius. When it comes to more realistic, grounded spectacle driven blockbusters or mind boggling psychological thrillers, he rarely disappoints. Interstellar is the example of Nolan at his greatest. This movie has some of the best visuals I've ever seen, right up there with the most divisive Star Wars movie made in history. You probably know which one I'm talking about. Hana Zimmer's score is booming with grandeur, every single performance is great (Matthew McConaughey is the standout, of course), the emotional weight is handled amazingly, and the ending is strangely confusing as it is beautiful. Wherever you can find it, I encourage you to see it is you're into space movies and Nolan's direction."
" Somehow confusing
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,6,"Acting is good, i like sf films, but the story in some parts are pretty confusing.
Special effects are oke, but not the best there is.
Its a ok film, but there are way better out there"
" Sharp, original sci-fi adventure with a punch
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,9,"A team of astronauts travels through a wormhole seeking a new home for humanity as Earth becomes inhabitable. Sounds like a hundred other science fiction movies over the last 50 years, but the approach is utterly unique.I didn't care for this movie the first time I saw it, mainly because I would have preferred almost anyone but Matthew McConaughey in the lead role of Cooper. But after repeated watchings, the depth of the ideas and the beauty of the film have made it one of my favorites. Saying almost anything else about the plot would spoil it, but I will add that it is just as much about Cooper's relationship with his daughter Murph as a child while he is still on earth, and as an adult (played perfectly by Jessica Chastain) working on Earth to find another solution to the problem of humanity's future. The movie is also strengthened by its love of science rather than flashy technology - the future earth is more like the Dust Bowl of the 1930s than Kubrick's or Spielberg's visions.The movie has exceptional visual effects, some intensely suspenseful moments, and a great score. There are a few maddening flaws - a crucial scene near the end drags on way too long, a couple of lines are repeated verbatim at different times like copy-paste errors, and I for one never want to hear ""Do not go gentle into that good night"" ever again. But those are minor quibbles in what is really a monumental achievement by Christopher Nolan."
" One of the greatest movies ever
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,10,Idk what to say...Just watch it and you will understand.
" Most pointless non scifi ever
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,1,"Putting a spacesuit on doesnt make a movie scifi. How this can score so high beats me.This is sentimental crap, even within that genre. A black hole has no relation to time travel or other dimensions . The only thing a black hole does is absorb stuff. Should have absorbed this movie too. There's just sooooo much non science and plane nonsense...."
" I will never forget this movie in my entire life
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,10,I really want erase all my memories and watch this movie again
" Amazing work
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,10,"Its my best movie
It's really amazing and I can say now after watching it that its the best movie ever"
" Every time another feeling
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,10,Only the love can through the area and the love full of space.
" I Saw This at an IMAX Theater
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,10,"I originally saw this at an IMAX theater in Boston and I must confess, this film was visually stunning and powerful in every way imaginable.It takes Einstein's notions of time, space and relativity, which I actually studied at Harvard University with a pretty smart Professor, and intelligently applies them to actual space travel, time dilation, and the issue of multiple universes/timelines, which have been addressed in scholarly works.A powerful film with a cogent message about ecology & the climate change problem on Earth.Have rewatched it several times; it only gets better. It also is a story of the bond between two intelligent, yet introverted scientific minded individuals, the father & daughter at the heart of the film."
" Breathtaking
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,10,"Nolan's finest - Interstellar üëèüèªI recall vividly the first I watched the movie, I was soo utterly blown away. It played on my mind for sooo long. And to this day I still get those feels when I rewatch.McConaughey is gold, and movies really don't get much better than this ."
" AMAZING MOVIE !!!!
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,10,"To lovers of science fiction and physical, this is your movie, it's a riverting and intriguing story, makes you lost your mind, cause to show you things that you would have never thought, from the first time catching you, a thought-provoking movie that raised many interesting questions. You may have to watch it twice if you wanna get of all. In fact, it was impossible to predict how it would end."
" Perfect
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,10,"This is an unbelievable movie.
I think it's the best movie in history"
" They Captured A Dream
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,10,"Beyond a well made and amazing VFX space exploration film, Interstellar captures one of the closest efforts to a real dream projected on screen I've ever seen. If your parents pass away at a young age, and that's how you forever remember them, then in your dreams you would only see them at that age. Even when you become old and grey, and you surpass their dying age, you would continue dreaming of them as young adult. This film really captured that for me. Plus the great performances of the actors and intense soundtrack really sells it."
" A visual spectacle that is Nolan's most emotional
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,8,"Interstellar is set in the future where crop blights and dust storms threaten human survival and so a group of explorers travel through a newly discovered wormhole to find a suitable planet to sustain human life.It amazes me how Christopher Nolan manages to come up with ideas like this. I admire how ambitious he is with his projects and Interstellar may be his most ambitious project to date. Despite its very long runtime, Interstellar never drags and that's because of the astounding visuals and emotion he put into this story. This is, without a doubt, one of his best looking films. There are just some films that are meant to be watched on a large screen with speakers to gain the full experience and Interstellar is one of those films. I honestly couldn't tell which scenes had visual effects and which had practical effects. They both blend so well and seamlessly to create some insane and phenomenal visuals that I think will age extremely well. The cinematography is amazing and you really get a sense that what you're watching is an epic. The sound is equally fantastic and Hans Zimmer's score as usual is incredible. It's a much more eerie score than what I'm used to hearing from Hans Zimmer but I liked it and though it fit well with the scale and stakes of the story.I've always been a fan of Matthew McConaughey I really loved his work here. His entire character has a very emotional arc and I felt the relationship he had with his daughter. A particular scene where we see McConaughey break down is easily one of Nolan's most emotional moments that is sure to leave people crying. For a child performance, I thought Mackenzie Foy and Jessica Chastain did a great job playing his daughter. Anne Hathaway was also really good as well as Michael Caine. There was an actor who I didn't expect to see but was pleasantly surprised when he turned up. I do wish there was more to Casey Affleck and Timoth√©e Chalamet. They both play the son of McConaughey but there was barely any development done to that character for me to care about him.Whilst Interstellar is a visual spectacle and portrays a heartfelt and emotional relationship really well, it's certainly not a perfect film. The dialogue isn't anything special and at times very cheesy especially with one monologue delivered by Hathaway. I'm also not completely sold on the ending. For this story and how high the stakes were, I felt the film wrapped up way too nicely.Despite my issues with Interstellar, I still think it's a solid and emotional film with terrific performances from everyone, some interesting concepts that I'll be pondering over and breathtaking visuals that will stand the test of time."
" A film that makes us think
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,10,"The best special effects without using CGI. Looking at this movie, we can say that it is not really a SF movie, because a lot of what we saw in this movie is scientifically proven. A MOVIE THAT WILL REMAIN IN THE TOP"
" I waited 5 years to watch it again
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,10,After watching this insane movie in the theatres back in 2014 I swore to god I will wait 5 years to watch it again so I get to forget it and experince the insanity it has again This without doubt is THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE
" Brilliant Space Film
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,7,"I loved the film, this is by far one of the best space films ever made. I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan and love all of his films."
" A Technically great film
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,10,"Yes, the movie has audio problems during dialogues , but this movie has best Sound and Visual effects. Sound design lovers must watch film."
" Genius
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie was the most genius movie, It gives suddle hints to an incredible genius ending"
" Best sci-fi movie I've ever watched!
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,8,Incredible graphics and good story. I would recommend watching. Only downside is that some find it confusing at times but overall I think it is an out of this world film..
" Must be studied
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,10,"This movie is the meaning of art
Thank u Christopher
Worth all the 7 times I watched it"
" Profoundly beautiful
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,10,"Each time I have the honour of watching this film I am brought to tears in its cascading beauty. Clearly one of the most science Rich scientists-fri films of all time. On par or exceeding 2001. And yet, perhaps more so, Interstellar is a deeply human film, about father and daughter.Each of Nolan's films are born anew each time you're-watch watch them. There is always something unseen to be understood.Nolan is a filmmaker who's genius is the reason why films should be made. Not to simply entertain but to have a lasting impact on us."
" ...""No, it's necessary""
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,10,"I don't know how many times I've seen this film now, partially or in full. Tonight I flicked the channel over and there it was, at the docking scene.... ""It's not possible."" : ""No, it's necessary."".... I need to go to bed but how can I even though I have a copy I can watch any time?This film is by far one of the greatest I have watched. It just does something for me and I don't think it's because I'm a father of girls or because I love sci-fi, although I bet that helps. I'm not a film critic, I'm not able to analyse a film to depth of someone qualified to do so by title, but I love my films and I love being immersed in something that surrounds you entirely. The score (listen to Hans Zimmer's soundtrack on its own, track 8.... mountains...), the cinematography, the worlds created, the scenes on the planets, the black hole, the seemingly interlinked relationship between the earth story and the space story, and most of all, the homage to Arthur C Clarke. I'm not sure why he isn't referenced or out there in discussions that I can find, but a large part of this film was written by him (indirectly!), anyone who's read Odyssey or Rama will know this. What Christopher Nolan has done to make this his is amazing in its own right.I know there are some critics, but for me, this film was 46 years in the making and I can only thank Clarke and Nolan for it."
" Potential not realised
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,6,"I feel this movie was so close but lost its way o so many fronts, there wasn't enough about the other side of the dimension for me. Maybe have another go and do the movie from the alternative perspective and do it better. Potential for sure but just not delivered on point as it so could have been a 8, 9 or even a 10. But it wasn't"
" Sorry, but no.
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,5,"Let me just get one thing out of the way: I'm scared of space. That means that a space movie needs to be *really* good to impress me. Stuff like Ad Astra and Sunshine has tried and failed to impress me in the past, but I went into this after watching Memento and Inception, both of which I thought were great, so I had a slightly bigger shred of hope than usual. This was two and a half hours of my life I wish I could get back.This is marketed as a space movie. Its name is Interstellar, for crying out loud. But you don't actually get to space until about 30 minutes into the movie. Also, it's never really described what's wrong with the Earth. Why is there dust? How will going to another planet work? You're not really invested into the story. There's no urgency. I didn't care.It starts up okay. The space journey is interesting, and there's a decent amount of action and suspense. In my opinion, everything starts to break down in the third act. I mean, love is the only thing that can cross time and space and unite a father and daughter? Seriously? And then there's just that part where Matthew McConaughey is just... floating in a 4D bookshelf? Honestly, at that point, this movie that seems to have been taking itself more or less seriously breaks down into full-on ridicule.There are also a lot of plot holes. How does the best scientist in the world not know how to operate an airlock? How is Cooper allowed to go into space but is apparently so clueless he is given the rudimentary paper analogy to explain a wormhole? And even more, which I don't have time to get into here. In terms of acting, Matthew McConaughey's performance is slightly flat, whilst Anne Hathaway gives a more interesting performance but is still lacking something.The only thing that actually saves this movie is the visual effects. I mean, it's directed by Christopher Nolan so I knew that I was in for some eye candy, but this was amazing. The black hole shot, in particular, blew me away, as well as the circular space station shot at the end. And of course Hans Zimmer's score was great.All in all, this would have been interesting if it wasn't for the cringe-ness of the last act. Absolutely not Nolan's best.-Sasha"
" Science Asthetic
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,9,"The thing got me rigid to the seat was the curiosity of a the crew and the creators who wants a better future from our crooked reality. it is not a puzzlement to fight, it is just a fervor ideology of a person who appealed to the science from the crew's perspective. So fighting over its philosophical aspects is diverse.Very glad thqt story turned in travelling with humanity aspects which we often forget to be grateful. Reminds me of the movie Solaris
1972."
" My hands are shaking
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,10,"As one cannot wrap their head around the universe, one cannot wrap their head around Interstellar... it's insane. You name it, this movie executed it flawlessly, something no other movie has ever done before. Nobody will ever be able to explain how good it is; one just needs to watch it."
" A Emotional Roller coaster
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,9,Christopher Nonel is one of the most successful Hollywood Director. His movies has its own genre. A mix of science fiction and emotion this movie is arguably one of the best movies of all time.
" Good, but not THAT good
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,6,"There are a few rules about storry telling and SciFi this mivie obviously breaks. Good SF does not deny what we allready know about the universe, but builds upon it. We already know there is no way anything manmade can survive beyond the event horizon of a black whole, so the story falls apart there. We also know how a black whole would look if we went close to it, so there is no point in showing it otherwise. Also, if at the planet surface gravity is normal, there should be no time distortion. The astronaut from the second planet, talking about its atmosphere, mentions ammonia and chlorine, when every highschool student knows those two gases can not coexist in the environment, as they react. Moreover, the story begining breaks the rules of logic. People in 2067 have clothes and cars like those in the 2010s? We can travel to Saturn, but can't beat a crops parasite? The parasite, an Earthly organism, can breath nitrogen, a totally inert gas? The extraterrestrials gave us the solution to travel to another galaxy and beat gravity, but couldn't help us fight starvation? Makes no sense!"
" Extraordinary!!
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,10,"Literally amazing,Nolan just nailed it. The story of the film is great and they really made it intense. Visual effects and sound are outstanding."
" A movie where science meets fantasy.
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,10,Oh what I can write about this movie. This movie represents some of the most fascinating theories of science like worm hole or relativity or time travelling. And the into a black hole part really amazed me. I just love this movie.
" How not to mix drama and science
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,1,"Not sure why this gets such a high rating. The plot is okay but the scientific backing is so flimsy one wants to cringe.There is no conceivable method of entering an event horizon without being extinguished. Black holes are not about time travel. The amount of energy required to get a spacecraft off the surface requires a rocket, which they used for lift off but then ignored for the rest.Quite disappointed."
" The worst sci-fi film ever made
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,1,Never before have so many actors been taken for such a useless ride of futility. There must be an easier to get to the 5th dimension. Even Spock would have raised his eyebrow in shock at Matt Damon arising from his cubicle crying hysterically. Why Michael Caine accepted such a part in this crime of a drama remains a mystery. This movie is a crime that made fools of all these actors at the end of their careers.
" Nolan's best film
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,10,One of the best sci-fi films ever made. The music alone will give you everlasting chills. Anyone that loves the genre must watch this masterpiece. It will bend your brain backwards and forward.
" wow,, just wow.
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,10,"Wow. how can I start? such a good plot twist i was not ready for, at all. I was simply so,, in the movie? I just loved loved loved it and can't wait to watch it again- highly recommend watching it a few times to actually understand everything lmao"
" Mind bending great sifi
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,10,"In my top 10 movies of all time, never get bored of it. Long story slowly executed but the end makes you watch the movie again! Absolutely masterpiece."
" 3rd time is a charm
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,10,Finally understood all the meanings (hidden between the linens) only after watching it the 3rd time. It's a really complex and comprehensive journey with lots of aspects to untie at you're own pase. Really enjoyed it.If you are slightly into Space/Universe stuff ... you'll love this movie!
" A true escape
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar provides close to a 3 hour respite from stressors of daily life. It is an experience and a ride that you will be glad you took. A story of survival, family commitment, and exploration into our vast, magnificent universe. Beautifully directed, acted, and scored (bravo Mr. Zimmer!) This film is a true 10/10!"
" Great Film
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,8,"This film made me think about human being in a way I'd never done before and displayed some graceful, beautiful cinematography. It's a very impressive story. While I've come to realize Nolan's blunt and gritty approach to filmmaking is not my favorite I think this one meshes the best with with my tastes."
" When Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer Come Together
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,9,"I'll spare the usual details given that 4000 others have covered the story of Interstellar. Rather, I'd like to say that once again I am truly baffled. Baffled at how every film the Nolan boys come together to write and direct, using the genius of Hans Zimmer to score their work, manages to evoke such emotion and captivate me to the very end.Despite the bitterness I have after seeing what Hans would do to the Lion King in Disney's live-action remake, I simply cannot ignore how unbelievably adept he is at his job.I decided to revisit this film after several years and found myself in tears by the end when Cooper and Murph finally reunite. And while the story itself surely had much to do with my reaction, I cannot ignore the role Hans' compositions played from opening credits on to the very end. I felt that final moment in my chest, as the two of them spent only a minute to acknowledge the journey both had taken.Am going to go out on a limb here and say that without this specific composer the film would have been very, very different. And Nolan seems to know just this. The partnership seemingly continues to sharpen their skills with each production. It's something I am in awe of as I watch the likes of Interstellar, Inception, The Dark Knight, and Dunkirk.An amazing sci-fi film with an original story to tell (rare nowadays) which you surely don't want to miss out on. This is one of those titles that I would put in the ""Must Watch"" pile as mandatory for everyone."
" I have a headache now...
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,9,"Holy molly...What just happened.... Interstellar is an incredible movie with some of Mathew McConaughey's best work ever. They affects were outstanding, the science was utterly confusing, which is a good thing. I like NOT knowing everything about the science in sci fi movies. It makes the movie more effective.
The music in this movie was almost perfect to the story. I don't think there is anything majorly wrong with this movie. The docking scene in this movie was I think the best docking scene out of any movie. This movie will go down in history for being in the top 3 best sci fi movies ever. Good job. :) This is in my top 4 for best movies i have ever scene."
" Epic Sci-fi Movie

" Interstellar movie review
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,9,"I watched this incredible movie almost 10-11 time. Not just I loved this movie, the reason for watching this film is the concept that Sir Christopher Nolan presented in this movie. The way he plotted every scene is just heart touching and must gave the viewers goosbumps, The concept of Dimensions and blackhole, time it just awesome. As a physics lover this is the perfect movie for them who love physics and also persue there career on physics must watch this movie."

" Humanity must find a new home or a way to conquer gravity. Some great visuals with accurate science.
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Then it eventually goes off the rails and creates a magic 5D space in a black hole with time travel. The plot is decently compelling, the visuals are pretty good. I'm not mad about filling in the gaps in science with some nonsense (unlike Contact where things already observable on earth are recast as religious nonsense). I guess it was a little hokey. Dialogue is ""clunky"" as one critic says. Not a bad movie."
" The best Movie ever made

" A movie that moves you
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,10,I can't remember a movie that I recommended to all members of my family 5 years after I saw it after my second viewing with so much fervour. There is so much to take in. I can't wait to watch it again. Such a beautiful film. I wish I could explain but I urge everyone to watch this movie. Essential viewing.
" A must watch Sci-fi

",2021-02-19 00:00:00,1,This movies needs to be deleted from the face of the earth. And that's putting it gently on how bad it is.
" Agree with everyone - good film
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,7,"A tad confusing and convulted but a good film nonethelessJohnathan, Christopher wraps the heady interstellar voyage around the bond between parent and child, or more specifically, that between Cooper and Murphy, who takes the parting especially badly; but these supposedly heart-rending scenes at the start are overwrought, and thanks to Hans Zimmer's good score. In contrast, a simple scene where the camera is simply trained on Cooper as he cries his eyes out watching years and years of backlogged video messages left by his son back on Earth is much more poignant - and without a soundtrack that instructs you how to feel.I liked the energy - it's much better than Inception.Much as Christopher tries to ground the movie in the humanity between Cooper and Murphy, 'Interstellar' is better appreciated as an exposition on big ideas - and there are many bandied about here. Mankind's place in space is encapsulated in McConaughey's lament that ""we used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars; now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt"". Much later on, Matt Damon pops up to make an emphatic point about survival as the primal instinct, and by that, we mean survivial of the individual, not the human race"
" A movie so good, you'll find new things with each re-watch
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,10,"One of the most scariest moments in theatre, was the scene where Cooper dives in the black hole. What the hell is at the other side? What will happen? Is it actually happening or is it somethin Cooper is dreaming?This was merely the tip of the question-iceberg that was roaming my head after my first watch. What can I say, the movie blew my f-in' mind! There were moments after moments of highly intense points, balanced by really slow tear-dropping scenes that moved all of us.And the clever writing? Well what about that! I once commented this on YouTube, but the scene where Cooper explains to Murph that he could be the same age as her, followed up by an angry Murph ranting, is due to her not understanding Einstein's theory of relativity. Cooper even mentions this to Brand later on in the film! But at that point the audience has already forgotten about the moment in Murph's bedroom. If that's not well-thought writing, I don't know what is.Moreover, the wormhole scene, the those-aren't-mountains, the DOCKING SEQUENCE, and last but certainly not least, the black hole scene. These few sequences is what makes this movie the greatest piece of cinema in my opinion! It's intense, it's raw and real, and it's science too. I recall people laughing at the 'fake mountains being too big' but guess? It happens that Kip Thorne, the scientist behind the script, figured these things out to make them plausible.Interstellar is one hell of a movie and you should definitely watch it at least once a year!"
" Incredible

" Well paced movie that didn't feel as long as it is.
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,9,"I was quite surprised to see how long the running time was, it really never felt like I had just watched a film of that length, which indicates to me the film had a good pace throughout, it never seemed to bog dog like some longer films do.If you are a parent I can almost be certain you will have a tear in your eyes towrads to the end, I am not one for tears in a film, but just occasionally something grabs the heart strings and you cannot help yourself.In all a great movie, both the wife and I enjoyed it, we are now wondering if they will return with a second film ?"
" Best. Movie. Ever.
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,10,"The bond between a father and daughter is truly something special. Throw in some amazing sci-fi and you get this masterpiece. The Matrix used to be my favorite movie, followed by The Shawshank Redemption. They're now number two, and number three, respectively."
" Only Mathew could be Cooper!
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,10,Interstellar is a timeless cinema experience in its true sense. You feel as if you are part of that world. The father-daughter relationship resonates till the last frame of the movie. The only movie that likens the power of love to the laws of gravity. Those few people who have missed this one... catch it up!
" One of The Greatest Movies Ever Made
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,10,I absolutely love this movie. It is one of the most re-watchable movies ever made. The heart wrenching score is absolutely epic. Matthew McConaughey's performance is brilliant. The love he has for his daughter Murph drives the film. I can't help but cry when they are finally reunited at the end. I love the color pallet chosen for the film and the camera angles. The story is phenomenal and so is the acting. The CGI is also great. It's crazy to think Stephen Spielberg chose other projects after reading a script like the one Jonathan Nolan wrote but it was for our benefit because his brother Christopher Nolan directed an absolute masterpiece. This is easily the best Sci-fi film ever made and in my opinion it is in the Top 10 for greatest films ever made period. Nolan has made so many excellent films but this is his best.
" Brilliant.

" It was interesting
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,7,"I recommend it if you like sci-fi.It was interesting because I could not predict the next line in the plot.
It has really good music and poetry.
It has great photography, especially the giant wave scene or Matt's docking.What I did not like is the cast.
Jessica Chastain is not pleasant, Anne Hataway is not for sci-fi (she is good is comedies). But Matthew was good in this role and he saved the movie."

",2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,"I have no idea how this film as an ""ok"" rotten tomatoes score, this is partly why I rely on IMBD reviews when deciding what to watch. This film is absolutely amazing, I am about as generic of a film watcher as you will find and being so I can confidently say the vast majority of you will also love this film. It is thought provoking, exciting and sparks the imagination. Amazingly well done."
" The visual, the story, the whole movie literally is an art

" Zzzzzzz
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,1,"IDK why so many people like this. It was like 4 cheesy scifi movies mashed into one long snoozefest. It relied on big budget effects and big name stars vice a decent plot. And, yes, I understood the story. It's not difficult to follow. It just sucked. Entirely toooo loooong."
" Nolan, you are an old fag, I mean genius
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,4,"I mean, real talent needed to create such boring and empty movies as Nolan does. Can't say that they among the worst, but they' re not any good."
" Incredible!!!
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,10,"I hesitate to put a movie here, but this really is up there with 2001: A Space Odyssey or the first two Star wars for space movies.This contains Spoilers so please don't read this if you haven't watched it already you are only depriving yourself. Also minor spoilers for The Dark Knight (2008).The score is chilling. Hans Zimmer creates the environment perfectly and resonates each scene so well.
The movie is genuinely gorgeous. The best looking movie I think I've ever seen (either this or blade runner 2049). All the CGI fits in seamlessly and what isn't CGI is so beautifully shot, creating the beauty of our insignificance. The lighting makes the movie stand out from any other good looking movie, aesthetically. And the creativity of those camera angles are amazing. The static IMAX shot from the corner of a ship or on the shoulder of a person shot is one of the most creative ever. It presents the ideal of the world moving around the protagonists and how their mission is vital so they must not take in the environment and be single minded etc.
Matthew McConaughey's acting is special. He creates the character and THAT scene gets me every time. He delivers the caring father mentality so well that when he has to leave them, it feels like you're leaving your own children.
It is an impossibly hard concept to grasp, obviously meaning-especially considering its Nolan-that there's going to be a ton of exposition. I do not mind exposition, but for someone who gets bored easily this could be a problem. It is necessary as the concept is a tough one, however it is not done particularly well. It is quite annoying though as it makes Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) seem dumber as he has to ask questions in space, where he definitely would have been briefed on earth, just so the viewer gets to know.
The theme of love transcending space and time, albeit cheesy, is presented beautifully, especially from the performances of Matthew McConaughey (Cooper), Anne Hathaway (Brand) and Jessica Chastain (Murph).
Another Problem with Christopher Nolan, for me at least, is his choice of sound mixing. I really enjoy some of it, especially the one about how there's no sound in space which is reflected through the music. however crucial bits of dialogue are sometimes mixed so terribly that the lines are completely unintelligible. Again this is sometimes good, as it helps understand the magnitude of the sound and situation they're surrounded in but at other times it is very annoying.
Dr Mann's (Matt Damon) character is one of the most interesting, probably the most interesting in the movie. Nolan definitely had The Dark Knight (2008) in mind when writing for this character. In essence, Dr Mann embodies the idea of absurdism, or the concept of what happens to someone when confronted by the absurd. This is the idea that anyone, no matter how good they are at heart, can have one bad day and become truly evil. As alluded to, this is shown in The Dark Knight. The Joker forces the people of Gotham to face the absurd through his actions in the final act and the Coleman Rhys scene: The people in each boat facing the absurd in the chance to blow themselves, or the other boat up. And choosing to kill Coleman Rhys or let the Joker blow up a hospital. These are examples of confronting the absurd as its the choice between two losing situations, the one bad day. This is doubly so as we see Harvey Dent, 'The White Knight' the best of us too. And the Joker subjects him to his one bad day and despite being this incorruptible figure, a force for good, the joker shows anyone can fall even Harvey Dent. In The Dark Knight this idea is to show chaos in The Dark Knight, here its trying to show the themes of Nature vs Nurture and how without love a man can turn to the worst version of himself.
(The Dark Knight talk over)
The final act of the movie is one of my favourites. the deliberate ambiguity really sticks in your mind for days. It also wraps up the movie perfectly and its really got that 'Ahhh' factor that few movies manage to do. This is through everyone's arc wrapping up perfectly:
Cooper-Who was struggling to reconcile with the idea of never seeing his kids again the whole way through the movie (It being his main driving force), realises he must give up his life and ambition in the aid of humanity.
Brand-Whose love with Edmunds is her driving force. This is to get back to him (There's that transcendent nature of love again) however she loses another love, not romantically but a Philia love (Friendship love), in cooper sacrificing himself for her.
Murph-One of the main reasons for her development is due to the resentment from her dad. The final act wraps it up for her as not only does she solve an equation that has already been through one person, but also the majority of her life, she also learns to love her dad again despite him being millions of light years away (There it is again).This movie works so well as the theme, plot and characters have complete unity and harmony with each other."
" Overrated
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,3,Nothing special with this movie . It is very long snd boring . Only good thing was the acting by the children and cinematography
" Really bad
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,1,"Don't listen to the positive ""reviews"" this is terrible. There is absolutely no way this film got this high a rating legitimately. It is in fact, the worst film of this genre I have ever wasted 2 and 3/4 hours of my life on. I could rant all day about the stupid, pointless, entirely predictable plot that was so full of holes and discontinuity that it reminded me of a cheesy, straight to DVD B-movie, but far less enjoyable, however, I seriously don't want to waste my time even more than I already have. The casting and acting was atrocious, apart form two legendary actors who hardly get any screen time and are killed off very early. The whole thing was boring and hollow, with no real substance, oh and have I said completely predictable, at every turn. The worst offender however was the audio mix... the OTT, generic, poorly composed, dramatic music is constant and so loud that it drowns out many lines of what could possibly have been important dialogue. I genuinely feel deceived and ripped off. What a waste of time and money. If I could give it minus starts, I would... Really bad"

" Falls short
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,6,"I really wanted to love this. I believe the miscasting of Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway took me out of the film, as did the cheesy ""love transcends space in time"" plot. Everything else was so great, but for me it fell short."
" Nothing i can say does justice.
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,10,The Nolan brothers have made a piece of history. That's all i can say to help you understand how extremely well done this movie is.
" You either love it or hate it.
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,10,"This is the first film with several flaws that I still rate a 10. Strictly scientifically speaking, it bends or breaks several laws of physics. So if you are a stickler for scientific accuracy, this ain't your movie. But, if you can look past the physics, you are in for a magical adventure. Otherwise get you some Jane Austen and call it a day."
" A film of great beauty and quality, which pleases dramatically and aesthetically from start to finish
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,10,"Having dabbled with earth-bound science fiction in The Prestige and Inception, 2014's Interstellar saw director Christopher Nolan turn his hand to space-opera. Set in a not-too-distant future in which mankind's crops are failing, the film sees a group of astronauts headed by Matthew McConaughey's Cooper set out through a wormhole in search of a new planet for humanity to colonise. Naturally, they face difficulties, but not of the aliens and space-battle kind; Interstellar provides it characters with more scientifically plausible threats.
As well as directing Interstellar, Nolan also co-wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan, and it's a characteristically cerebral affair. This is science fiction that had a theoretical physicist as a scientific advisor and the challenges it presents include the effects of relativity, as Cooper's likelihood of ever seeing his children again grows ever more remote, and the gravitational forces of black holes. The story's scale is broad and deep, and is weighty not just in scientific terms, but also philosophical ones, the script musing extensively on the nature and power of love. At the same time, the first part of the film - set in an entirely recognisable near-future American dust-bowl - grounds the film in reality, and by taking the time to explore Cooper's relationship with his daughter Murphy it also provides it with an emotional heart. The film isn't entirely bereft of action however, thanks to the treachery of Matt Damon's Mann, a scientist who realises that his own survival matters to him more than that of mankind's.
The film unfolds relatively sedately over two and three quarter hours, but rather like 2001: A Space Odyssey, this is a film so visually beautiful that it's easy to just sit and drink in the spectacle. The special effects are breathtaking and so are the sets. There's an internal consistency to the design of the technology that is speaks of great attention to detail, and the novel blocky design of TARS and CASE is ingenious. The film marks cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema's first collaboration with Nolan and he does a superb job, not just of the outer space sequences, but also during the location filming, which makes effective use of the panoramic vistas of the Canadian landscape the scenes were shot in to create an impression of a sickly, ailing world. Innovative use of hand-held cameras also helps to emphasise the claustrophobia of the space ship sets and nauseating dizziness of zero gravity. The astonishing visual are complemented by the soundtrack provided by regular Nolan collaborator Hans Zimmer, which perfectly captures the dramatic but often melancholy atmosphere of the story.
The casting of Matthew McConaughey as Cooper proves to be a masterstroke, as he gives an astonishingly naturalistic and at times emotionally charged performance, especially during Cooper's scenes with Murphy. He leads an impressive cast for an impressive film, and everyone is perfectly suited to his or her role, including Anne Hathaway as Amelia Brand, Matt Damon as the treacherous Mann, and Jessica Chastain as Murphy. Smaller roles are taken by the likes of John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Wes Bentley and Casey Affleck, and they all get under their characters' skins. This being a Christopher Nolan film, Michael Caine also appears, as aging scientist Professor Brand, and he brings quiet dignity to the character.
For all of the film's scientific credentials, Interstellar isn't a documentary: the film's lengthy denouement inside the tesseract takes the story into the realms of pure fantasy, and results in a fairytale happy ending that somehow manages to compliment the theoretical physics of the middle section. There's no reason why it shouldn't: it's an approach that worked for Stanley Kubrick and whilst inviting comparison (even unintentionally) to 2001: A Space Odyssey is asking for trouble, Interstellar compares well. It is a film of great beauty and quality, which pleases dramatically and aesthetically from start to finish; Christopher Nolan has yet to make a bad film, but it seems distinctly possibly that this one will come to be regarded as his best."
" Masterpiece
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,10,This is without any doubt the greatest movie I've ever seen. The emotions are beautifully retransmitted by Nolan and the cast that is perfectly chosen. I can only recommend Interstellar for any movie lovers !

" one of the best movies in the history of cinema (9.6)
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,10,"A great movie that I watched many times, should definitely be among the best movies of all time. It is one of the five best films for me.
It's really hard to understand Nolan's mind and I watched the movie with my mouth open.It's amazing to convey space, planets, gravity, everything like this. There is a lot of emotion in the science fiction movie, and you definitely cry at the end of the movie. Simply awesome."
" Murph's ghost
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,9,"I heard a lot about this epic space film
Finally today I watched it
When I finished half movie I thought what's great in it but than when I came to know what was actually wrong with Murph's ( Cooper's daughter) room I went from 70 to 100 .
The cinematography was brilliant the 2nd best cinematography I have ever seen after 2001 : A Space Odyssey
The story was well written but the problem was they explained too much ( I got these perspective of viewing from a YouTube channel studiobinder )
The concepts you should know before watching this film - Artificial Gravity, Spinning Black hole, worm hole and the most important 5 dinensional reality.
For me this 3rd best Nolan's film after The dark Knight and memento
And 2nd best sci fi movie"

",2021-01-25 00:00:00,10,"My absolute favourite. Can watch it over and over again. Goose bumbs all the time, even when I see the detail and difference of the costumes - especially the NASA space suits - covering plusminus 30 years of future development in what seems to me 80 to 90 years in the future already. Time. Which could easily be the central theme of this movie. Time and Love. Humanity and their devastation. And progress at the same time. Love this movie to pieces, and like to speak a word of gratitude to every maker involved. From the Writer, to the Director, to the Actors and to the very last Runner. Sublime performance. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!"

It is really that good that many people think it's the best movie ever. I think it's visually the best ever and my only comments about Interstellar are all about why I find a few other films to be better all time. Not the best movie ever but damn close!
" A Masterpiece of Cinema
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,10,"Put short, Interstellar is the perfect film.The gripping, emotional storyline had my full attention throughout. This is a long film - about 2hrs 50mins - but I never lost interest once.The soundtrack - where to start! Hans Zimmer is an incredible composer, and there's no exception here. The fantastic songs, especially 'No Time for Caution', give me chills every time, and add a whole other level of epic to the film.The acting and directing are both great. Nolan continues his streak with this film, which I'd argue is his best. Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway are both brilliant, as are all the actors and actresses in this masterpiece.This is, and most likely will stay as, the only film I give 10/10. Definitely worth a watch.T.W."

It's a great plot, but it fails in execution and sone planning!The problems they encounter in space are not tacked logically never mind scientifically , like...
Why explore planets so close to a black hole, it's stupid there's no future in it (excuse the pun).Why explore Mann's planet and why does Dr Brand has an emotional connection with one of the explorers.The black hole communication with Cooper's past is iffy at best, but as we don't know any better technically it's liveableThey never brought anywhere near enough fuel for what could be the most important mission in historyThe big problems are two really badly cast roles...
Anne Hathaway's Dr Brand character is just annoying, stupid, and arrogant, but Hathaway is miscast in the role for me.The elder Dr Brand character played by Michael Caine is also miscast for me.Both are excellent actors don't get me wrong, just not in these roles. There was no empathy, no feeling or sympathy generated between viewer and character, I really could care less if both characters fell under a combine harvester!... then the next issues are technical like the TARS robot, it's just not credible, a big shiny metal box with pivoting legs and whacky programming.... just doesn't feel right, and doesn't help sell the movie!.. and the cheap along the fuselage shots of the spacecraft, couldn't they afford decent CGI with this budget.... and why the hell are they submerged in water for the hibernation units!.... and finally it's just too bleak throughput, it needed to be much more positive, instead it constantly feels like they're going to fail, and you quickly end up wanting them to!So all in all, a good sci-fi movie, just not a classic one!"
" Explaining complicated things with forced and lazy dialogue
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,8,"Really, is OK, but is not a masterpiece, i thing nolan started beliving he is ""C O M P L EX"" by explaining things that will make you thing you're Smart, but you're stupid if you really thing this is a masterpiece, they thing you're dumb, and explained this to you the easiest way possible, just dumb"
" One of my favourite films of all time
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,10,Brilliant. Watched it loadsStory is cracking. Loved the fact that they spent a long time on the science before production too. Kip Thorne was heavily involved in the concept. He's even written a book on the science behind it.But even if you're not a science nerd it's fabulous cinematography and a truly engaging plot. Acting is fab too.Perfect pace and just love how the story unfolds.Makes you really think and at the same time helps you grasp some of the basics to the most important realities in the universe we live in.Master piece
" the movie to cruise your emotions, heartbeat and tears.
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,10,"I've watched interstellar almost 50 times and it never failed to amaze me and give me the goosebumps .in this movie you will explore bond between a father and daughter trying to save the planet at their best and the fact they are lightyears away but the thing that connects them is love they share for each other. it is beautifully directed by chritopher nolan and heavenly music by hans zimmer will make make you feel more than alive, story is well scripted and cast made an extraordinary performance to make this masterpiece a masterpiece. even if you haven't studied science in your highschool years this movie will not disappoint you."
" Future!
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,10,"This movie gives me the feeling, this is what the future gone be! Watch it more than ten times and gives me a feeling of homecoming. It's like looking in or future. And above of all, good acting. Really good!"
" It's a masterpiece
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,10,"This film is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen. The visual effects are out of this world. Nolan delivered a movie that can only be fully understood when you watch it multiple times. The story is quite scientific yet very emotional.
Hans Zimmer delivered by far the best work of his career with this mesmerizing soundtrack. A shame that he didn't get an Oscar for this.
All in all it's still impossible to describe it properly, you just have to experience this masterpiece by yourself. When a movie deserves a 10/10 then it's this one."
" A Response to Kubrick
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,10,"I have a bias for movies that at least seem to take space seriously. I think it explains why I put Contact atop my list of Robert Zemeckis movies, and I think it's why Interstellar is probably going to end up at the top of my list of Christopher Nolan movies. It's the kind of story that I gravitate towards naturally so that when several movies are at about the same level of esteem in my mind, it's the space stuff that just ends up winning out. The movie still needs to be good though, and Interstellar is great.Matthew McConaughey's Cooper is the exact opposite of The Protagonist in Tenet, which I find interesting and points to why one movie works on an emotional level and the other is more purely spectacle. Cooper has a specific emotional touchpoint, his daughter Murph, where The Protagonist pointedly had nothing specific to drive him to save the world in Tenet. I think it's a testament to some of the more traditional building blocks of storytelling and utilizing them in intelligent ways can lead to more complete stories.So, the world is slowly ending. Blight is killing the world's crops. First was wheat. Soon, okra will be gone. Corn's days are numbered. Blight, thriving on the nitrogen in our atmosphere is killing our food supply and will soon turn to our air supply. Something must be done, so the remnants of NASA have devised a plan to use the mysterious wormhole that has appeared orbiting Saturn to find a new home in another galaxy. They had already sent through a dozen people a decade before, giving them three potential worlds on the other side of the wormhole that they could colonize. Cooper, a former pilot turned farmer, stumbles onto this plot when a gravitational anomaly in his daughter's bedroom gives him a set of coordinates in binary for NASA's hidden base on in old NORAD facility.I think this movie ends up working so well in no small part because of how it begins. Nolan takes the time to set up the world, its deteriorating and diminished condition, as well as Cooper's relationship to Murph which carries him through the entire film. It's for her that he decides to go on this mission through space and gravity, which guarantees that he'll miss decades of her life. It's for her that he wants to return home, to a home where not everyone has died. He's contrasted sharply with Doyle, one of the other astronauts. With no personal connections, he looks at the problem with the least humanity, feeling that their priority should be the quickest and easiest solution in order to guarantee that they save what they can.Also on the ship out is Amelia Brand, the daughter of the chief scientist at NASA trying to figure out the problem of gravity that will get them off the ground in great enough numbers to survive as a species. She has a hidden motive: to reach specifically one of the three worlds, Miller's planet, because she loved him before he left. Her specific attachment drives her just like Murph drives Cooper.Back on Earth, Dr. Brand takes Murph under his wing, getting her into college to pursue an education in physics that is in short supply because the needs of the world are so centered on growing food. She grows into a woman and chief student of Dr. Brand, eventually learning that Dr. Brand had known for decades that there was no solution to the problem of gravity, and that there was never any hope for anyone left on earth. Colonization needed to happen with frozen embryos that the ship carried with it to the other galaxy. In her mind, her father left her to starve and die.This movie has a lot of moving parts, and I haven't even gotten to the three planets, but Nolan handles it so deftly that it's easy to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Nolan has such command over the story and its cinematic rollout that one can lose yourself in the story without ever feeling confused. Combined with the embrace of time mechanics as Cooper's adventures with gravity slow time for him, the movie keeps the different threads extremely clear as they progress at different speeds towards a single conclusion.In terms of the movie's treatment of space, this is where the realistic approach to filming the special effects, with an emphasis on camera placements that are attached to ship hulls, really helps enhance the film's sense of scale and danger. We can hear the rattle of the different parts of the ship scrape and hit against each other as the ship enters the wormhole. When the Endurance passes Saturn, it feels tiny in comparison. When Cooper takes the Ranger into the black hole at the end, it feels terrifyingly huge and dangerous.The first planet they visit is a water planet that stretches time by a couple of decades and shows them a planet void of any life despite the presence of water. The second planet is Mann's planet. Dr. Mann was the best of the twelve, the leader, the one who inspired the original group all to go, and his data on his planet was promising and closer to the first planet than Miller's planet. The time on Mann's planet was shown in trailers, but Mann himself was completely hidden. Played by Matt Damon, he ends up being the manifestation of what Amelia Brand described as nature being violent and overwhelming but not evil. The only evil we can find out among the stars is what we bring ourselves. Mann faked all of his data because he couldn't face dying alone. He was completely selfish, as opposed to Cooper's selflessness centered on his family and even Doyle's selflessness unmoored from any humanity.Now, having said all this, I love this movie as it is. The final act in the Tesseract is the kind of heady thing that embraces time mechanics mixed with emotional storytelling that I love, using science fiction to tell a human story. This also represents Nolan's response to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Nolan obviously loves Kubrick's film, as evidenced by his efforts to have the movie restored for 4K and his many public comments praising the film, but, watching Interstellar, it feels like he has a certain fundamental disagreement with 2001, especially the ending.In Kubrick's film, humanity evolved through Dave Bowman becoming the Starchild after passing through the Stargate. In Interstellar, Cooper remains decidedly human after passing through the black hole and the Tesseract. There's no great evolution. We're still human. When he finds himself on Cooper Station, dozens of years after he had originally left, boys are still playing baseball and cheering when they hit a flyball through someone's window (in a circular design that directly evokes Rama from Arthur C. Clarke, who co-wrote the script for 2001). We can save ourselves as we are, Nolan seems to be saying. We don't need some outside force to take us another step in evolution. We have it in ourselves to take us further. There are other callbacks to 2001 including the use of Saturn (which Kubrick wanted to use late in production instead of Jupiter, but his special effects team rebelled and kept it as Jupiter) and the overall structure of having the Tesseract in place of the Stargate. I love both movies, and Interstellar is great, but it's not quite 2001: A Space Odyssey brilliant.I think this is Nolan at his height. Technically, the movie is at the top of the heap of cinema magic. Narratively, Nolan found a way to keep the stakes of the movie small enough to understand but still tied to a larger problem. In terms of performance, Matthew McConaughey is probably the best leading man Nolan's ever worked with, imbuing Cooper with such pathos as to invite real emotional connection. Anne Hathaway gives it her all as Amelia. Jessica Chastain is wounded and proud as the adult Murph. Hans Zimmer produces one of his best soundtracks using a huge organ at its core. This is Christopher Nolan exploring his cinematic loves at the height of his power in Hollywood, able to turn a heady science fiction script into a rousing and even touching adventure through space and time that made gobs of money at the box office. This is really why I love Christopher Nolan as a filmmaker in general."
" Too long to be amazing, but still tall and reflective!
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,8,"Christopher Nolan's impressively contemplative film has more than enough to present us with a great visual spectacle with respectful performances, even though its length may be too long to make this film unforgettable."
" the more you watch, more information you get
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,10,Honestly i thought this is just for this movie until i watched TENET and realized that i have to at least watch Nolan's movies 5 times in order to get more fact.
" Very good
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,9,McConaughey is excellent. Best performance of his I've seen. FX are brilliant. The concept is mind bending and I loved it.
" I regret not watching this movie in the theatres
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,10,"So keeping this short and simple. This is my favorite movie of all, The trio of Nolan, Zimmer, & Matthew really hits home for me. Must watch for everyone."
" One of the best Sci-fi movie
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,8,"This is the best sci-fi movie I've ever watched.
The story set the movie at the top of level.
This movie should be telecast in shools to improve students curiosity in Science."
" Bigger than cinema...
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,9,"If anyone has been left with powerful feelings after this please get in touch. But not powerful in an emotional sense, but in a 'I have to change the world' sense. Apart from Avengers Endgame this is the only movie that has made me feel like that. Many of Nolan's movies are seismic in theme like 'save the world' and no greater than here. But surely this is the greatest adventure of them all that probably gets even better with age. Most importantly, it's a film about love and hope, the 'unknowables' of life.Help me change the world!!!For those bickering about the science are truly unlucky to not enjoy such a piece. It's not about being 100% clear or making sense but capturing a story and emotion and taking your mind someplace else, someplace challenging ... I give it a 9 out of 10 only because every movie ending is a new beginning, just like here, it can never be complete. Cooper riding off to his new home is just the start of another exciting adventure destined and charged by love and hope."
" Go, get intrigued and push the boundaries of your mind.
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,9,"One of the best films of the entire century! A superbly crafted, MIND BENDING, action packed, chilling thriller and suspense movie.."
" Rewatch this if you get confused
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,10,"I first gave this movie a 7, but then I rewatched it and I totally changed my mind. It made sense the first time I watched it, but it was just to confusing to enjoy. But when you rewatch it, everything makes sense and I love it. The CGI or whatever it is called is top noch, the acting was great, and the science seemed really accurate. If you were like me and thought it wasn't good because it made no sense, re watch it and you will like it."
" one of the better ones
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,9,"Well it checks all the boxes ... re-watchable movie within the sci fi genre
nolan and his grandiosity trying to reach for the kubrick and his original ambiance ..."

" Interstellar 2014 Review
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,10,"It's hard to put words together for a film like this. Mind-boggling? Introspective? Stunning? Stellar? (pun intended)
Interstellar really is one of those films that once the credits roll you just sit back in your seat and contemplate everything. It really has everything. Award winning acting from both main and supporting actors / actresses, an impactful and mind-bending story, beautiful awe-inspiring settings, a thrilling, phenomenal score, and some absolutely stunning visuals that leave you breathless.
I've seen this film twice in high school - once in physics and once in astrology. Both times I never really payed attention and only remember snippets of scenes. I really took for granted what I was watching, or maybe only watching it it 45 minute blocks also effected my viewing / attention towards the film. But now, three years after graduation I finally gave this film another shot. One of the most beautiful movies i've ever seen and definitely worth every second.
I would kill to see this in theatres."
" Surely one of the best movies ever made...
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,10,"From the amazing acting, the stunning visuals, the immense sound track and the plot, this movie is in my view one of the best ever made. I've watched this masterpiece about four times now and each time I am drawn into the movie and totally engrossed. The nearly three hour epic literally blows by (time is relative after all). Sure there is a significant sci-fi aspect to this movie, but putting that aside and just thinking about the concepts and themes that are raised is enough to drawn in the audience regardless of their appetite for sci-fi. A rollercoaster of emotions throughout which are guaranteed to give the viewer much to ponder. I can safely say I'll be watching this again and again over the years and likely enjoying it a little more everytime I do so. One of Nolan's absolute best...and that's a hard call to make considering his filmography."
" Emotional and epic
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar- a masterpiece from Christopher Nolan. Everything in this movie is top notch from acting and directing to Visual effects, sound effects,sound editting etc. It is definitely one of the most epic movies I have seen in my entire life."
" not as good as it looks
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,8,"I am disappointed by this movie. Up to halfway through the movie I wanted to review this with with saying that I am amazed. But 2nd half was total nonsense. Only graphics kept looking good. The story just lost any sense. Too complicated, unclear, fake. Negative ending. I expected much more positive ending with much more stuff resolved, more people alive and younger people, and some simple new planet. Instead, it looks like chaos. 5D, professor admitting some lie, accidents, and some bookcase that just is not convincing. Dull emotional reaction in the end, everything haywire. Only good because of topic, good beginning because it is intriguing, and good look of space and machines. Topic is the best, and very realistic at beginning. Also do not like long movies, this one is longest so far. Much better scientific same or similar movies are Source Code (2011), Geostorm (2017), and Deja Vu (2006). So yes, is this movie filled with wonder, feelings, good topic and science? Yes. Is is filled with something so important and extreme and realistic? Yes. But story is more and more bad towards ending. Could be much simple, much better, much more clarified, and much more positive."
" Film had potential but didn't live up to it...
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,6,"Star studded cast with Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine & Matt Damon.A former NASA pilot is asked to leave his family behind for several years in order to take a group of researchers & explorers in search of a new planet for humans to live on as earth becomes inhabitable & food becomes very scarce.After being gone for many years he discovers the man who gave him the mission lied to him about being able to save the species & so he tries to return to earth to be with his family before it's too late.I found the film very complex & hard to follow & it was too long aswell. The plot had potential but the film never lived up to it. I wouldn't recommend watching this."
" Steller
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,10,All time favorite. Watched it over 10 times already and every time feels the same.
" A Stellar achievement
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,7,"If you know or can get a hold of theoretical physics, you'll love this movie.
I just think of some of the most thought provoking, entertaining, well written movies, and I wonder at what point did half of these necessitate depression?
Personally I thought the Matt Damon sequence in the context of the film was a form of ""Dark Comedy"".....Just from when they woke him up you knew he was clearly out of touch with reality....then the statistical probability of docking while rotating like a toddler with hyperactivity. Then flying through a black hole just in a space suit....anything that hit the emotional buttons was negated.
I did feel it was a bit stretched out.....and I would have preferred some expediency to get an idea of Our protagonist reconnects with Cat Woman like Adam and Eve of a new world...but that cliffhanger like Inception seems to be a staple.
Overall entertaining, and far better than ""The Martian"" and ""Ad Astra""....I'm just saying for depression and feeling hopeless about the self destructive behaviors of humankind, I can read the paper every day, I enjoy the thought provoking film....but if it's going to be 2:47 minutes don't depress me in the ""artistic"" process.
Being a science fiction person and having some familiarity with theoretical physics I appreciate the movie. If I saw it in an IMAX I may have boosted it up a star.
All that being said there were too many scenes where I said to myself....e.g. can we save Coop, and blow up Dr. Mann more expeditiously please? Can they just say where going to Mann not your ex boyfriend without a metaphysical philosophical discussion on love (which could equally apply to true hate)?
With the suspension of belief, the on and off good and bad writing, and amazing effects I'll give it a seven."
" Fantastic Film - Love Transcends Time
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,10,"Great film and great performances by both Matthew McConnohey and Michael Caine. I remember following this film back when it was being made because they had all these documentaries about the making of it and in them consulting theortetical physicists about the behavior of black-holes and attempting to create what one would look like in space. Then in seeing the film, I really enjoyed how the final product turned out. Great work!"

The spectacular Screenplay from the Nolan brothers along with Han Zimmer's Music makes it a masterpiece. The screenplay itself has many layers to it. Film has beautifully portrayed the relationship b/w a man & his daughter as she grows up. My only regret is not being able to watch this movie with all its spectacle in pure 70mm IMAX.

A twelve-year-old is capable of writing better stories.The plot (or: which plot?) was unnecessarily drawn out, put an emphasis on special effects, turned unnecessary details into long scenes, forgot to explain important details and had no plot or whatsoever.Not even Topher Grace could save this movie and I love this guy.I can only describe watching this as torture, the highlight was when the movie was over and I felt relief.If the good reviews on here are genuine, people truly lack depth and appreciation for intricate plots, a good story and emotional involvement. All I felt was boredom."

",2020-12-28 00:00:00,10,"This is truly a masterpiece in an era where movies are made just for special effects and mostly for teenagers.It isn't perfect of course, especially with all the technical data, but hey, this is not a documentary. And so giving it only 9 starts would be a shame."
" Best Movie ever Made...
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,10,"Just one word, PERFECTION!Words cannot describe the emotion behind this movie. Cinematic Masterpiece!"
" Interstellar review
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,8,Saw it cuz it was a Christopher Nolan movie... Yeah it was very impressive.. I just loved this one... But i should have been a little more clear in the ideas ... I know I'm asking for a thing which can be not available in Nolan movies...!üòÖ
" What a ride
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,9,"I saw this movie in IMAX and it what a ride! The visual are stunning, the soundtrack is amazing and the story is very great. Furthemore, for once in a Nolan movie, I was able to relate to main character and feel emotions about the story.A very great movie at home, and incredible one in IMAX."
" The Review
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,10,"Literally one of the best movies ever!!
If you have not watched this yet you probably should stop reading this and start watching it right now.
It is an out of the world movie, even physically. No such space movie has ever been taken in this way. The wormhole transports not only the cast but also your mind to a whole new level. I dont want to be a spoiler but I assure you that you will get goosebumps after their trip to the first planet.
It is a MUST WATCH. No wonder Christopher Nolan has an IQ of 150"
" How does anyone come up with this?!
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,8,"Christopher Nolan has done it again, he has got to be one of the greatest writer/directors there is. This movie is great. There is nothing else that comes close to what this movie achieves. The visual a amazing, the acting is amazing and the story is amazing. Every twist was just perfect and really shocked me, every emotional scene hit hard and made me care for the characters. My one complaint is that I haven't watched it twice. I need to as I don't believe I fully understood the movie but would after a second watch, then I could give it a higher score. For that reason, 8/10 watch it, then watch it again."
" Time dimension
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,9,Well what can I say about Christopher Nolan. The epitome of perfection. This movie is way ahead of its time. I cannot give any spoilers but someone who enjoys real creativity and art must watch this movie
" Best Sci-fi.
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,10,Very rare will you feel strong emotions in a science fiction movie. Hans Zimmer's soothing BGM coupled with Nolan's direction has produced another masterpiece.
" Astounding
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,10,"My view for what it's worth. Watch it....then watch it again....and then watch it again.
Only then can you catch all the small details that on first viewing you might miss....the handshake being just one.
Superb acting, incredible visuals and a wonderful score underpin a complex moving and compelling story. Never seen anything like it. An amazing cinematic achievement."
" BEST MOVIE EVER
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,10,"This most be the best movie i've ever seen. It was so emotional and well-made. The graphics combined with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is just utterly beautiful. Never took my eyes off the screen once, and it was breathtaking from the first moment. The story developes so good, and no scene in the movie feels forced. Just loved this movie so much, and will probably always go down as my favourite."
" A Stunning Cinematic Achievement
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,10,"Christopher Nolan is probably my favourite director of all time with FIVE 5-star films from him that I've seen. This was the last major Nolan film I had yet to see, and I absolutely loved it. The visuals in this film are just fantastic. Even if I watched this on mute I'd still get more out of it than most films. The score is just absolutely phenomenal too - people make fun of Hans Zimmer's scores a lot, but they really work at building tension in my opinion, and bar Inception this might be his best work. The direction is fantastic and the sheer scale of the film just blew me away. At risk of sounding cliche, this felt very 2001: A Space Odyssey, except with a legitimately engaging story (and I love 2001 so that's a huge compliment). The relationship between Cooper and Murph is well explored. The main issue that people have with Tenet is that The Protagonist doesn't have much of an emotional connection with anyone, meaning the personal stakes are kind of low. I didn't mind this myself, but this film just showed that Nolan can do personal stakes and do them really well. Part of this is Matthew McConaughey's outstanding performance, but mostly it's just how their relationship is set up during the opening and how well it is closed off. The ending just blew me away, and every direction that the story took really worked for me. My only nitpick is that some of the exposition felt a tad clunky towards the beginning, but exposition is important in a film this high-concept, so I can forgive that. And, for an almost 3 hour film, I didn't feel the length for a second. Overall, this is an inspiring, beautiful and an utterly fantastic film, and one of Nolan's best."
" Such a great movie!
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,10,This movie is definitely worth a watch. Love the cast.
" Loved it

" best movie
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,7,"The directing is great, but I think the music needed better redistribution, but I generally enjoyed the work very much"
" Actually one of or the best cinematic motion picture I've ever seen
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a brilliant masterpiece which had deserved way more oscars!
The performance of Mathew Mcconaughey was outstanding. It brought me to some of my most emotional Situations and thats what movies are made for.For everyone still not seen this movie... Please go ahead and enjoy one of the most brilliant movies ever made."
" Almost a great movie.
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,7,"I really really wanted to love this movie. It ticks off most of the boxes to be great, but blunders heavily in a few areas. It's a long movie and they toss in a dumb subplot with Matt Damon to prop up the sagging middle of the story. The central theme is dopey as well, love reaching through time and space??
But the ending is just plain funny. The main character promises his daughter he'd come back. He does and meets her as an old woman on her deathbed, but he doesn't stick around because in a minute he's off to meet up with his love interest. Wow, way to go keeping your promises!"
" a complete masterpiece
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,10,No words... if you haven't watched yet just watch it now... outstanding
" I'll call it a MASTERPIACE
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,10,Such a great movie! Every little detail makes sense to the whole story. I would totally recommend it. I's very emotional and shows the world like we've never seen it before. A truly phenomenon!
" almost perfect
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,8,"Its not just a good story, but also some of the most breathtaking visuals I've seen. What keeps me from giving this a higher rating, is the ending. I dont mind the whole 5th dimension thing, but when I saw murph in her deathbed surrounded by her familily. I kinda lowkey cringed. But that is the only thing I can think of that didn't sit with me well.8/10: oh yea"
" Best Sci Fi of all time
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,I had to watch this movie a few times to really understand it. Dang made me sob when I figured out the real story. Amazing movie and a great cast.
" A masterpiece
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,This is the reason why cinema was invented. From the picture to the score to the plot and the acting. This movie is just a masterpiece.
" How is this Nolan's Fifth For Me!
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,9,The beautiful effects and planets enlighten the dramatic and emotionally engaging acting. With another highly clever script and story Nolan delights us again.
" My favourite movie of all time
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,10,"A masterpiece. The visuals, the score, the space travel, the cinematography, everything. The only cinematic flaw I can find, if I look really hard, is a couple dashes of cheesy dialogue. Going to be hard for a movie to top this one for me personally, I've never left a theatre with a feeling like I did when I was leaving Interstellar. Blown away. Every time I watch it I feel the emotions just as intensely. Christopher Nolan x Hans Zimmer undefeated"
" Engaging, deeply dramatic and scientifically accurate, it has some flaws that are hard to forgive.
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,8,"This spacial sci-fi film has an interesting and appealing story: in a dystopian future, almost the entire planet suffers from chronic food shortages due to overpopulation and poor harvests. In view of the urgency to feed the world and the inability of Earth to be able to generate more food, NASA secretly creates a program to find more habitable planets in order to save some humans. After a mysterious event at his home, former astronaut Cooper discovers these project and is recruited, despite the opposition of his daughter Murph, having to lead an interstellar spaceship in a voyage to investigate three planets only accessible through a ""wormhole"" next to Saturn.This is a really worth seeing film, despite its script being made of hits and misses and has many confusing situations, which only seem to be within the comprehension of those who have a PhD in Astrophysics. Much more than a sci-fi film, it's a true drama. One of the things that most caught my attention, and that contributes to the dramatic load, was the way that each character has to sacrifice personal interests in favor of a bigger cause, and to decide between what they want and what needs to be done to take the mission forward. This gives the film an emotional charge that is not very usual in sci-fi and that was even exaggerated. I can give an example of those exchanges of messages between the ship and our planet, which, despite being useful in the task of making the characters more human and pleasant, are overly melodramatic. Also the dialogues sound artificial, melodramatic and clich√© sometimes. Another feature that pleased me was the concern with scientific rigor, whenever possible (congratulations, Dr. Kip Thorne). However, even here there are shortcomings, with poorly explained space-time advances and setbacks and an extremely confusing ending. And, of course, there are flaws that are already common in cinema, such as the providential way in which the protagonist will ""stumble"" on a secret space project that he should not have known and become the right man for the thing. There are hundreds of movies with similar flaws.The cast is led by Matthew McConaughey, who had won an Oscar before and shows all his charisma and plays wonderfully, particularly the young MacKenzie Foy, very sweet in her role. Anne Hathaway also shone and did well in her role. Equally flawless were Michael Caine, David Gyasi and, particularly, Jessica Chastain. Ellen Burstyn also had time for an interesting and honorable cameo. I didn't like Matt Damon's work, I think his character is one-dimensional and very uninteresting. And I don't understand what the hell Casey Affleck is doing in this film.But who really deserves applause is director/screenwriter Chris Nolan, by the ambitious way in which he planned the film and the determination and commitment he put into it. There is no doubt that he knew how to get the best out of the cast and, despite not having made a perfect script, he created an appealing story that does not put science aside to enter into creative daydreams and delusions. The film is long, the pace is slow and this is not always justified, with the film spending a lot of time on lengthy scenes and sequences, almost without an audible sound. Despite this, it's one of the most visually extraordinary films I have seen recently. Cinematography takes advantage of the best of CGI technology and creates realistic space scenes, which have been expertly complemented by real settings and traditional special effects, which Nolan masterfully uses. In addition to all this, we have excellent sound effects, editing, and Hans Zimmer's extraordinary soundtrack, perhaps one of the best that he has ever created, with a deep and rich sound."
" A masterpiece that change your vision
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,10,This movie was one of the best that I ever saw . Thanks so much
" Heavily overrated
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,5,"Sure, the plot isn't bad, but it's pretty predictable. Of course they'd find a way in the end. It's fun enough, but way too long, considering that nothing is happening a lot of the time, they could've fit the movie into 90 minutes, which is how long most movies last."
" Deep in heart, stunning views, a sensational mission.
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,10,"This is the best sci-fi I have ever seen.
Every actor has given a performance they should revel in. At no point did I as the viewer feel disconnected. Matthew Mcconaugheys character takes us through the whole journey in his cool/comedic and fearless friend...some extraordinary shots of space (CGI most likely). Their mission is filled with every emotion you could feel in their situations. The musical score is second to none. Dimensions, black holes and the functioning differently on different planets. But someone's gotta check em all out and save the world ey? Some people have say there are certain theories which cannot be correct etc with this movie... Of course nobody knows yet, just enjoy the ride. It's as accurate as one might imagine the depths of our intricate universe to be.
Watch it closely, you will become entranced by this masterpiece. A second viewing really works wonders too.
It's a long movie... Almost 3 hours...but you won't want it to end.Be prepared to pay full attention and immerse yourself in Nolans masterpiece!"
" This (for me) is More than just a great movie!!

" Another amazing film!
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,10,"How does he do it? Christopher Nolan is either a mad man or a genius. This film blew me away. The visuals were outstanding, acting was really good, the story was SO original! I have yet to watch a Christopher Nolan movie and give it a bad rating because every one of his movies is better than the last. This movie is almost 3 hours of mind bending, trippy awesomeness. Please watch it, you will come out of it thinking about every aspect of our reality."
" More emotional the the second time
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,9,"The second time I watched this is 6 years after I saw it in 2014. Enjoyed it the first time, let time passed so I forget some of the storylines... the second time I'm watching this and I was overcame with such emotions I did not experience the first time. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved the first time watching Interstellar, but the second time really hit me.Mackenzie Foy as young Murph was magnificent. Matthew McConaughey was truly transcendental. Every one of the actors in this movie was brilliant.The Nolan Brothers really know how to create modern sci-fi classics, that not only take your imaginations to different worlds but also able to tug you at your heartstrings.I will watch it for the 3 time in 5 years time. :)"
" Blown away
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,8,Felt like a movie where I think I'm not gonna understand it by the end but then I do!
" Typically mind-bending and visually breathtaking
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,9,An astonishingly ambitious project by Christopher Nolan is executed almost flawlessly. So rare to see this kind of subject matter given so much authenticity. My one gripe is that I found it almost impossible to interpret Matthew McConaughey's southern drawl and eventually had to resort to subtitles (this is NOT a movie that should have be watched with subtitles). Truly staggering production by a man who continues to raise the bar.
" Perfect
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,10,Nolan is a genious. I was surprised by the senario and the film itself. And... Mathew Mc was the bestüëèüëèüëè
" Dramatic start ruined by silly change-the-past theory
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,7,"First part of movie is solid, dramatic picture of mankind's hopeless state. It even felt like I was watching 'art-house' level film.
But then pops out this completely funny change-past-from-future theory.
So these are us, who are correcting the past from the future, using multi-dimensional space in black hole, created by the more distant future us?!
And if future us will achieve such immense creative possibilities, why change the past?!
Or, if the past has to change, how do future us suddenly become so powerless to not do it themselves?"
" Unnecasarily Long, Yet At Times Brilliant And Visually Beautiful
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,7,"I question the films length, and whether it might be one of the factors working against its overall enjoyment. To be sure their are brilliant moments and visually beautifully scenes, particularly those involving the dust storms, the massive tidal wave, and Manns icy planet. But the film also has silly moments that are less then Narratively satisfying, or unecassary plot devices, such as Manns betrayal and attempted murder of Cooper. I think the movie would have worked better condensed and shortened. On the other hand their are intellectual pleasures and emotional scenes that also make it not all together a bad experience."
" WTH, how a movie could be like this

" The best sci-fi movie I've ever seen.
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,10,This has got to be the best sci-fi movie I've ever seen. It had me glued to the screen every second of it. The pacing is perfect and didn't want it to end. I would have loved to be part of the experience of watching it in a cinema when it first came out.
" Interstellar
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is a movie like no other. Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth-crops and humans.Farming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, ""we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score. The sound literally took my breath away. Forgive me for the next paragraph. I will gush irresponsibly about the magic that is this movie's sound. Skip it if you please. You have your warning.The music fueled every important scene. In every meaningful moment Zimmer's harmonies captivated watchers' attention in the way of a coach commanding a locker room with a pregame speech. The music elucidated those emotional scenes, particularly ones featuring Cooper and his daughter, in a way that no words or visual ques possibly could. I sat frozen, jaw agape, with tears pouring down my cheeks as the music completely overwhelmed my emotions. The sound penetrated my soul and reverberated through my body, flowing to my appendages, supplying me with life like a heartbeat pumping blood through my veins. The music was truly the life force of movie.Yes, we all witnessed a visual triumph, a daring creative wonder the likes of which we haven't encountered since Inception. Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.I walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that...."
" An extraordinary experience
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,10,"What we should know about the director, Christopher Nolan is that he is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it.The movie features great actors, for instance Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Cane, Casey Affleck and Matt Damon. We can see excellent performance from every one of them. Furthermore, I beleive the cinematography in the film is some of the finest I've seen in years. The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Nolan just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack made by the great Hans Zimmer is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are at home and you will be lost in space. I have to say it was a truly unique experience for me.My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It is a classic. This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought!"
" Best Sci-fi movie
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,10,I think this movie is the best and closest to.my heart when i think about any sci-fi movie.
" An incredible movie by Nolan
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,9,"I watched the movie for the first time is four years ago and I watched it again two days ago. I can say the first time I couldn't understand well because it's a long movie and you really should think about all scenes but the second time I watched the movie very carefully and again I was impressed. When I had seen Nolan's name I've been curious about the movie because other Nolan's movies are well-known also very good but that movie different from the others. It is Nolan's masterpiece.
First of all, Movie's musics are well-prepared by Hans Zimmer. You can really feel all emotions which are movie wants to give to you. In the majority of the movie's scenes, we are in the darkness and endless space. You feel scared, tense, and a lot of other emotions. Musics can support these emotions such as Cornfield Case. It is one of the main musics of the movie and whenever we listen again in the movie we've got goosebumps.
Moreover, the flow of the movie is also another good point. From the beginning of the movie, everything has integrity and every details depend on other details, and these things create a powerful structure of the movie. Obviously, it isn't an easy movie for audiences. You must follow the plot carefully if you miss any point, you might don't understand some ideas about the movie. Also, I suggest that you should watch the least of twice.
Finally, the cast of the movie is very of good quality. We can see Matthew McConaughey as a headliner and according to my idea he has a really important effect on the success also there is a lot of famous actor in the movie like Anne Hathaway, Matt Damon, Michael Caine. All of these actors have a lot of experiences and everyone knows their skills. They show us every little emotion and important points with their acting.
To sum up, I can say this movie is one of the best movies which is I have ever seen. It isn't short or easy maybe you cannot understand when you have watched of the first time but after the second time you are gonna be impressive and you are gonna say ""Wow"" at the least I said that. I don't know when a new film shows up like Interstellar. It was really good I really do like it and thanks to all employees who work on this movie."
" Yes it is indeed the best movie ever
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,10,"This is a movie that leaves you speechless in awe. It changed something in me. It made me remember the importance of love, rekindled a sense of gratitude for living on this beautiful planet and showed the importance of caring for our earth. How this did not receive any oscars is beyond my understanding. As a comment I read on Youtube says: ""Born too late to explore earth, born too early to explore space, born just in time to watch Interstellar!"""
" Great movie!
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,8,"What a great movie! Nolan never lets you down, epic scale and brilliant filmmaking."
" A masterpiece
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen. The visuals are stunning, the actors are perfect, and the action is amazing. By the time the screen cuts to black, you are left in awe of what you had just witnessed. This is truly one of Christopher Nolan's best works."
" The pinnacle of cinematography
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,"MY OPINIONThe actingInterstellar can rely on strong acting from first-class actors to livens up the struggle facing humanity against the blight and famine plaguing the Earth.The scoreHans Zimmer does such a great job at projecting emotions through his music and could alone tell a whole story. This soundtrack captures the vastness of space so well. He caressed the face of God with this soundtrack. Why this score didn't win an Oscar for Best Original Score back in 2015 is the question of the decade.The direction/cinematographic qualities?Christopher Nolan worked closely with the theoretical physicist Kip Thorne, to nail down the scientific accuracy of Interstellar. As a result, Nolan's genuine sense of creativity matched perfectly with Thorne's scientific background to make such a realistic movie. What's more, we can recognize Nolan's touch for establishing a strong connection between a character's decision and his emotional background, as he did so well in The Dark Knight. Nolan is probably the best director in the industry today and that is why producers trust him enough to fulfill his vision.The sound/visual effects/general aesthetic?The Academy Award-winning Visual Effects represents the brilliant attention to detail to keep the story alive. Interstellar's representation of a black hole was so outstandingly accurate that eventually, it allowed the release of two scientific papers.The atmosphere?The atmosphere of Interstellar is mainly dramatic and serious, at times even somber and mind-bending. The beginning of the movie is the only time we can experience a cheerful scene, through the chase of the Indian drone.The story?From the concept of time to the sense of humanity we experience through love, Nolan covered thought-provoking, at times philosophical concepts quite impressively. Despite the complexity and greatness of themes covered, Nolan's skills once again showed off to pull them all together.The effect on the audience?Interstellar is, in my opinion, what we call a once-in-a-lifetime experience. This kind of experience makes you walk away from the theater tweaking something in the core of your soul.REVIEWWhen I walked to the theater back in November 2014, I was completely clueless about what to expect. As soon as the credits started scrolling and people in the theater clapping into a standing ovation, I know I had watched a masterpiece.Interstellar is the kind of blow-away experience I wish I could see more often in the theater; the one which embodies a different world, making you walk out with your spirit still locked in it, a majesty you will always carry with you. Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer are virtuoso. Absolute perfection is nothing less than the accurate depiction of the best soundtrack of Zimmer's career. Zimmer's score is in total symbiosis with the growing intensity of the movie. This gripping score manages to thrills and to represent the quiet beauty of music as strongly and heart-wrenchingly as the story it goes along. Nothing less than a spectacular masterpiece could spark from the gathering of such masters.
This long and epic journey into the vastness of space keeps us engaged through the whole film. Each moment of Interstellar unraveled against such a beauty, that I felt sucked into it. Rarely have I been moved that much by a movie; tear-jerking and emotional throughout (My goosebumps had goosebumps). (SPOILERS) The scene when Cooper, returning from miller's planet, is watching 23 years of messages, is in my opinion of the saddest and intense scene in the history of cinema (END OF SPOILERS). Special mention must also be made to the ending scenes of The Last Samurai, LOTR: The Return of The King, The Dark Knight, The Green Mile, Gladiator, and Endgame.At first, I didn't grasp everything about the movie. I was so amazed by what I had just seen, still, it was raising a question in me: Where are we going? (About Zimmer's piece: Where We're Going). With Interstellar, Nolan is revolutionizing the Sci-Fi genre, as Kubrick did 2 decades before, proving once again what can be done with modern technologies. Nolan is one of these geniuses living among us we will speak for generations.
Interstellar is, without a doubt, the best movie ever made and truly unique experience. My rating for this masterpiece can't be something else than a 10 out of 10. I wish I could live again a first-time experience watching this movie."
" INCREDIBLE! What a movie
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,How did Christopher Nolan does that again anad again ? His movies are unique and one of its kind. He is nest director the Hollywood has and his thinking is superb. I was Speechless after seeing this movie
" A True Masterpiece of Sci-fi Genre.
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,10,"The most advance sci-fi movie ever made in history. Kip Thorne was so dedicated for using the truest science theories in the movie. Chris Nolan has done the most amazing job though. Cinematography and BGM were outstanding. This movie really feels real. I was feeling that Probably I'm in place of Cooper while watching the sci-fi masterpiece.
A must watch movie for Sci-fi and Space lovers."
" Best movie I have ever seen
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,10,"This movie is great, in my opinion is one of the best movie made by Christopher Nolan and my favorite movie. The movie is scientifically accurate using Einstein's theory of relativity to tell an emotional story."
" The best
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,10,The best movie i ever watched is Beautiful and Fu**ing great
" Incredible
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies ever made. It is absolutely mind-boggling and even though you don't understand a squat the first time watching it, it still amazes you. I've watched this at least 10 times and it never gets old. I just love it."
" This deserves 10 stars
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,10,The sound and visuals and everything is much more than than good. I want to forget this movie just to see it all over again!!. The build up of scenes and the actors just nailed it..
" One to remember
",2020-11-26 00:00:00,10,"I'm not sure where to beginning, my knowledge of space and science is limited but this film blew me away with the concept of space/time and black holes. I'm actually not sure what to do with myself now!
Left me speechless. Watch this film, left feeling weird and that I hardly know anything about the universe and that there is so so so much more to just the dimensions we see and know of!"

" The best movie ever made

" Thoroughly Confused
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,5,I don't think I could've been more confused. I could not for the life of me follow or comprehend the time travel element. Like it was 7 years in that planet then 23? Then what did that guy do on the ship for 23 years just hang out? That. Yet have been excruciatingly boring. How did the Ann Hathaway role mess things up? And where and what did Matt Damon come from? That was entirely random. I think I need more of an understanding of science and physics to understand
" Best movie I have ever seen

" After 6 years...
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,10,"...I am here to say that this movie 6 years ago made me cry, and I were not even a father that I am now. And now 6 years later I cried more. When you think about time, and how it is relative make in us a big void inside. And this is the main message in this WONDERFUL movie. Time is void, however who you love make us complete.
Mathew had one of his most powerful acting. The storytelling is a piece of art. The narration of Michael Kane is so deep that make it sound like poetry every time. This is a movie for people who have brain. Brainless can not even understand what is going on there and for sure will say it is slow paced, that it is the ""worst movie ever"" that they slept all movie long because it must be terrible to those brainless folks."
" Great
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,9,It's very good movie and the specific things about this movie is that the products of science which we can do in future and disturb present how we can see why the moment today from today otherwise we should have to face such an extent things in our near future so this movie is completely year good movie which is purely based on Science nothing any jumpscares not any kind of fictional things just about what size are doing today and it that may contribute towards the future this is all about from Sujeet Dev Pandey

" Film score as emotional story telling glue
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,10,I have seen this movie 3 times in the past 12 months and I wondered every time why I was touched by it. Then I suddenly realized what it was when the main tune was ringing in my head. It's the repetition of this specific tune at important emotional moments that glues the story together and this climaxes off course towards the end. Never ever have I been so impressed by the impact of music on my movie viewing experience.
" Left me speechless
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,10,"Everything about it was brilliant;

",2020-11-13 00:00:00,10,Its very hard to actually narrow down a favorite Christopher Nolan Film. But I feel I watch this one most. And definitely has a great sense of humanity in it. So In my opinion this is My favorite of all his films
" The only movie that brings me to tears everytime
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,10,"Apart from the great cinematography, storyline and acting. Interstellar will keep you on the edge of your seat.
The first time I watched it I was amazed that a film could be that awesome. Christopher Nolan is a true genius.
After the first watching I promised myself that I had to wait 5 years to watch it again. And I did! For 5 years I ignored everything about Interstellar so I would forget it and watch it like the first time. It worked and it was as good as the first time!
I could watch it over and over and never get bored"
" After 6 years I went back... and this movie still blew my mind
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,10,"Its been over 6 years since I see this movie and I had to re-watch it again (for the 4th time) to transport myself to a truly amazing outer world experience.The Nolan brothers wrote this masterpiece and Christopher Nolan directed - what amazing minds! This Sci-fi movie had everything I want and more in a movie.... action, love, intelligence, A-Class acting and space exploration. I adore every part of this film and the AI robots that follow the characters about in the film add a wonderful touch.This movie blew my mind back then and it still does now."
" a masterpiece
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,10,"Rarely do I ever find a movie that I can watch countless times yet every time, it feels like I'm watching it for the very first time. Although most of Christopher Nolan's movies are like that, this one goes above and beyond. The acting is just so pure and beautiful. Hans Zimmer wrote some of the most amazing soundscores in movie history. As for storyline and plot, simply breathtaking. Bravo."
" Perfectly crafted, life-improving cinema.
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,10,"Science-fiction (or fact, to be precise) that you feel in your Spirit. Nothing else comes close to encompassing the soul of not only cinema, but of humanity - it's significance, resilience, passion, aspiration, consciousness, and purpose. It'll help you stop questioning whether or not we exist for a purpose."
" Perfectly visualised
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,10,All the unseen places shown in this film looks it has to be looked like this
" Sci fi good but not mind blowing
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,8,"I watched this before and have just rewatched it. I saw the title somewhere and couldn't remember if I had watched it before. As I watched it, it started to come back. I don't know if it is because I have read some great scifi but this one wasn't particularly super wonderful. In reading wonderful sci fi, I get the benefit of a certain amount of description of the fabulous plot, world building, creatures, characters etc. My mind does the visualizations. And I prefer it that way. It is part of the enjoyment that is appealing about scifi: we have to use our imaginations. (This is similar for me with music videos: when they first came out I hated them as I had no interest in someone else's interpretation visually of the music - even if it was the writer of the music themselves. ) With the moviemakers they have to do that visualization for us. I liked the premise of this movie. It got stretched a little thin probably due to the limitations on the length of the movie itself. But the premise and the story weren't better and I mean as good as many books I have enjoyed. Did they do a fab job turning a story and premise like this into a movie. OH MY GOD YES! but its a high bar to jump over the movies in my head when I read a superlative sci fi book.It is telling that I didn't remember if I had seen this. But an enjoyable 2.5 hours."
" Simply amazing movie
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,10,"I dont think, I can say anything that hasn not been already said of this movie.
Simply amazing in so many levels.
I just love how everything connected together. Seeing him reaching his doughter through the time was so bittersweet.
One of the best movies ever made."
" Best Sci-Fi film ever
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,10,"I am a huge Sci-Fi fan, Star Wars being my favourite film ever until I saw Interstellar!
The first time I saw it, I was blown away! I love the science involved in this movie, excellent cast and original story.
I have since watched this film a dozen times and it is every bit as good as the first time."
" Best movie in Cinema History
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,10,"With Christopher Nolan's storytelling and Hand Zimmer music, this movie is beautiful and just stunning. Not once during this 3 hour movie did I get bored and lost intrest as this story is just unbelievable. Matthew McConaughey is extraordinary in this and the music is on another level. This movie is why I stopped believing the oscars as this movie is life changing. Watch it right now if you haven't."
" Enjoyable and well made, but not physics.
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,7,"Much is made of Prof Kip Thorne's involvement to ensure realistic representation of the underlying physics. He's having a laugh, all the way to the bank as Arthur C Clark said after 2001, A Space Odyssey. Still, both films were excellent entertainment."
" One of the best films ever made
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,10,"I honestly could not fault this film. Visually sensational, acted sensationally, the story is incredible and Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway do it justice. Intelligent, gripping and brilliant.Anyone who rated this film lower than 10/10 is seriously uneducated."

" This is my favourite movie of all times
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,10,"I have watched this movie 3 times now and probably will again. The science, the theory and the beautiful story line of Murph and her dad just gets me everytime. This will probably be my favourite movie of all times"
" Just NO
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,2,"I can't even! How is that so many reviewers say that this is the best movie they have ever seen? Seriously guys? That fact couldn't be true even if this is the only movie you've ever seen! Come on! I was falsely believing that this movie would be a revelation just from reading these reviews and the movie you were all talking about was this abomination? Oh Hell no! And I gotta say, this was obvious from the very beginning! I just can't believe it! The movie did not make sense at all! I mean ok you gotta simplify some stuff for the sake of the audience but if you have to take it this far, then just don't make a movie with scientific facts! This is a mockery of science! And a mockery of a movie plot in general! Underdeveloped in every sense! I was just waiting for it to end!"
" Simply WOW
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,8,"I do not know how to put it into words. This film really was amazing. Other than the fact that there is a meme in there, the whole storyline was simply mind blowing. I liked how every bit of detail was thoughtfully added which helped to become key details in the film.Besides, the whole cast only made the whole film better. When they returned to the ship from the first planet, the emotional torment they went through really stuck to me. Also, the bits of humour with the robot that they interwoven throughout the movie was pretty good too.Lastly, I will say that it's spot in the Imdb is definitely well deserved and was well worth my 3 hours."
" The best ever
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,10,The first best space and sci fi film ever I saw. The story flow and the conveying part of the film has the most contribution. It has the high mark of Nolan's creations. I doesn't wanna say more words on this. This is a must watchable film to every movie lovers.
" Masterpiece
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,10,"Do you still remember the feeling from your childhood when you see something grand. Those butterflies in your stomach, the want that this moment should never end.
Well I got that feeling when I watched Interstellar especially the Docking scene.
I don't remember any other movie that made me feel that way. For me it is a 10/10 movie.
Everything is class apart for this movie; The story, screenplay, visuals and of course the soundtrack."
" Great,Emotional and Epic
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,9,"Must See movie. One of Nolan's Epic. Story moves Fast, With Emotion and stunning Cinematography and Sceenplay. Most of All Zimmer's Amazing Score which will make u cry . It is one of best space exploration movie ranking Atleast within top 3. 100 percent Worth Watching."

" Best Sci-fi Movie.
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,I have seen many Sci-fi movies in my life. But this is the Best Sci-fi movie I have ever seen. All the scenes and storyline is just The Best. I have no words to describe this movie.
" This Movie is going to stay for a long time
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,"I know a lot of people judge this movie on its love theme, black hole depiction and few scientific inaccuracies but to be honest the last movie to be an epic space movie was probably 2001 ( not counting obvious fantasies like Star Wars). This movie feels like it can happen to mankind in future with real depiction of space, with few creative liberties of course as technologically we are in infant stage and therefore have less understanding of universe, are very rare. The A list cast (except kid Murph) are a bonus of course and overall the story feels very epic and larger than life which a space themed movie should be.
So until the next Kubrick/Nolan ( I am no Kubrick or Nolan fanboy by the way) comes along and makes a movie without Hollywood Movie clich√©s (read Gravity) , this one will stay in memory."

" Drama and SciFi
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"It is very hard to successfully combine an accurate depiction of an abstract physics problem with good and compelling storytelling, with a solid drama. This film got it."
" An incredible film weighed down in part by some heavy exposition
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,8,"The years-long save-the-world plot, poignant near-future setting, and infinite themes both heady and heartfelt are all undeniably epic and compelling, and while the exposition weighs quite heavy at times (see the repeat of the ghost revelation), it doesn't stop the film from reaching many incredible cinematic heights both emotional (see the devastating return from Miller's planet) and action-oriented (see the spinning dock sequence), helped as it is by stunning visuals, music, and performances."
" I'm silenced by the beauty
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,"Mostly at some point during a movie, I will check my phone or be distracted by something. But now, not for even a second. I was sitting in complete silence watching it from begin to end in my home. Over two and a half hours passed by in what felt like minutes. To me, this is, and by far, the best movie I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot.I don't know how to explain the beauty of it. I don't know how to explain that I have never been more focused on anything than I was watching this movie.Just watch it for yourselves. When you watch it:
1) Don't look at trailers or parts of the plot
2) Do it at home, by yourself"
" Fantastically great movie

",2020-10-31 00:00:00,10,"Now this is what I call science fiction. I had been waiting for so long for a movie like this before it finally came out. It's a masterpiece. Unforgettable soundtrack, stunning visuals, tense action scenes, touching story that always make me cry like a baby. And SPACE. This movie is everything a space geek is looking for. Many years have passed and no movie can surpass the emotions this one gave me. That's why it's still my number one.
Maybe_not_so_interesting_fact: scientists consider this movie to be very scientifically accurate in many points. But it's still science fiction. So enjoy!"

" Thought-provoking, heart-wrenching, and thematically powerful, 'Interstellar' is Christopher Nolan's finest achievement: an epic sci-fi masterpiece.
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,10,"It's set in a future in which crop blights and dust storms threaten humanity's survival, and follows a group of astronauts on a daring mission to enter a wormhole in the hopes of finding a new home for mankind...Nolan crafts something memorable with 'Interstellar'; a film that takes its ambitious central theme of love and creates a profound story around it, simultaneously huge and intimate in scope: the unshakeable bond between father and child that literally saves the human race. And it's executed to perfection, with a metaphysical finale that stays true to this theme at the cost of perhaps dividing the audience. But it works, and it's very emotional and powerful.Matthew McConaughey delivers a career-best performance as Cooper, a widowed engineer and former NASA pilot who is drawn into mankind's greatest endeavour. He's an explorer who doesn't belong on a dying planet, and he's destined for the stars. McConaughey brings all the emotion required to help sell his character's actions. The hopes and dreams of a future rest on Cooper's shoulders, and he's constantly tested throughout in perilous situations that have dire repercussions for himself and others; and he's unwaveringly faithful to his tenets and his children.'Interstellar' masterfully sets up its crucial mission, and it delivers all kinds of feelings that stem from real-world concerns surrounding fate and choice. The existential elements are always at the forefront of the script, and once the film throws us into the vast vacuum of space it elicits feelings of awe and dread in equal measure.This is aided by sensational special effects that are as scientifically accurate as possible. The ominous emptiness of a black hole, the swirling unknown that encompasses a wormhole, the sheer terror felt from a wave hundreds of feet high... 'Interstellar' is just visually stunning throughout, and there's innumerable other examples that corroborate this.It's breathtaking to behold, but it's also memorable in the sound department too. Hans Zimmer produces one of the greatest scores ever committed to film; a grand soundscape of wonder, beauty and eeriness that's a separate emotional experience all in itself. Paired with the memorable imagery, the music is enough to give you chills, particularly in its strongest narrative moments - of which there are many.Overall, 'Interstellar' is simply breathtaking. Never has a film evoked such monumental feelings in me like this science fiction adventure has. From the screenplay, to the performances, to the visuals, to the music... everything just clicks into place like it was meant to be. It's an extraordinary experience, it's perfection - and it remains my favourite film.10/10"
" Very deep and touching
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,9,"A magnificent Matthew McConaughey (as always) and a very good developed plot lead you in a fantastic and utopian world.
I normally hate science fiction but this film is one of Nolan's masterpiece. Absolutely perfect."
" One of the most amazing films I have ever seen
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,8,"For a long long movie, this one is certainly worth the while!
The parallel editing, the non-linear narrative, the cinematography.. all was top notch. Lighting and scenography is beyond exquisite, as for the Direction, well, Christopher Nolan certainly did make his best movie in this one!
I would certainly watch it over again for the n-th time now!"
" Dimensions of the INTERSTELLAR
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,9,"Dimensions of the 'INTERSTELLAR' #interstellar #tesseract #atheism #dimensions #blackhole #gargantuaSome movies really amaze me. Interstellar is one such movie. I have seen this movie about 5 times now. Surprisingly every time I watch it I find something new in it which I have not noticed before. The first time I saw it, it just left me awestruck. It was a work of fiction actually but almost made me feel that it could just be possible in near future. The whole episode when they visit the first possible world was truly an experience from another world. The next time I saw it, my belief in 'they' being responsible for all these happenings was intensified. And I even had a heated discussion about 'their' existence with my son, which he turned down immediately. The gen next is leaning more and more towards atheism and I am not sure whether it is a positive sign or not. Anyways, as I was saying this movie compels me to think about a number of situations every time I watch it. The fourth time I watched it, I felt that Dr Mann was so human when he actually tries to takeover the ship 'Endurance' and flee and leaves those who came to rescue him to die. Just for the sake of getting back to the civilization, he sends all the false data. We all sail in the same boat like Dr Mann to achieve our own success, at the cost of so many others. And today I watched Interstellar for the 5th time and it left me spellbound once again. One of my favorite teacher's always used to say; The longer you can remain an atheist the better it is. I never understood his words fully. But I realized what he meant, today.
In the final scenes of the movie when Cooper reaches inside the 'tesseract' within the black hole, Gargantua , he gets answers to all the questions his daughter Murph and he have been chasing.
The movie begins in the mid of the 21st century. Cooper and Murph finds some binary codes and strange happenings in her room which are due to anomalies in the gravity. Little Murph calls it the ghost in her room. When they follow the coordinates, they reach a facility of NASA where Cooper meets his professor Professor Brand who reveals that 48 years earlier, unknown beings positioned a wormhole near Saturn, opening a path to a distant galaxy with twelve potentially habitable worlds located near a black hole named Gargantua. Cooper who has piloted spacecraft before is asked to head a mission to find these worlds along with Dr Amelia Brand (Professor Brand's daughter), Dr. Romilly, Dr. Doyle, and robots TARS and Case. When Cooper says that he is concerned about his children on Earth, which is slowly becoming a dust bowl, the professor explains to him about 2 plans A & B. Plan A involves developing a gravitational propulsion theory to facilitate a mass exodus, while Plan B involves launching the Endurance spacecraft through the wormhole with 5,000 frozen human embryos to colonize a habitable planet. For the plan A to work, the professor needs to find a solution to the gravitational problem. Meanwhile Murph after becoming a scientist realizes that Plan A, requiring unattainable data from within a black hole, was never viable. The crew finds out that the planet which Dr Mann had promised to be viable for life is actually not at all human friendly. And hence decide to go to the third option, Edmund's planet. With insufficient fuel to reach Edmunds' planet, they use a slingshot maneuver so close to Gargantua that time dilation adds another 51 years. In the process, Cooper and TARS jettison themselves to shed weight and ensure Endurance reaches Edmunds' planet. Slipping through the event horizon of Gargantua, they eject from their respective craft and find themselves inside a massive tesseract. Here Cooper realizes that the ghost in Murphys room is none other than Cooper himself but in another dimension. And when his robot says that, 'They' have created all this, he says NO we have created it, if not today than some day.... It is we who can and will find answers about our very existence, about our survival and where do we go from here...At last the solution to the gravitational problem is sent by Cooper through Morse code to Murph through a watch which he had timed with his watch before leaving earth. Cooper finds himself in a space station which is orbiting around Saturn and meets his daughter on her deathbed who advices him to go to Dr Amelia Brand who has reached the Edmunds planet. The interesting part is the film also proves that, Love and Gravity can travel through dimensions‚ô•.
However this does not make me an Atheist, as I still believe that there is someone out there who actually chose us to be here on earth and find out about the universe, other worlds and explore it again and again. And then the question still remains, what happens when we die, the body decomposes but what about something called soul? Does it exist at all? No one knows, perhaps maybe some day that will also be answered, but till then, let me keep believing in the presence of something higher than us... Thank you Interstellar for a wonderful experience once again. Maybe next time something new comes out of it, but as we the people in this generation say, TIME WILL TELL... MAYBE IN THE FIFTH DIMENSION..."

" A movie not recommended for normal people
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,9,"It is a vey complicated movie with a very complicated ending. It shows the life and nature of space/galaxy's. I recommend this movie for people who like variety in movies. Ending is very hard to digest/understand.l don't recommend this if you want a fun watch with a easy and quick understanding story but it is recommended for people who are fed up of movies with fight,drama etc and want an change in movies.I conclude that this movie is worth for your time."
" Amazing and smart
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,10,"An amazing movie, is a little Long but is that kind of long that you don't want it to end, you kept asking for more.. I remember waiting for 10 nominations and got nothing.... probably because one year before Gravity won, but THIS MOVIE IS 10 TIMES BETTER...."
" Great
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,10,Just Great...... Must Watch..... Really really nice..
" On repeat
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,10,"In 2001, Kubrick saw a future that was out of our hand. For Nolan, our reliance on one another is all we've got."
" You will like it if you understand
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,10,"It is not easy to understand, specifically if you are not familiar with the time theories.

" A skillful piece of filmmaking
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,9,"At first I was reluctant to watch this movie 'cause of Nolan's reputation of making overly complicated and confusing films, I prefer staight forward film but this movie is not that confusing as it turned out, well, maybe except the end part. This is truly a masterpiece and surely one of Nolan's best.Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is an integral part of the movie and it created so much emotion, feeling, suspense and tension, without his brilliance the movie would not have been as amazing as it was.
The Cinematography is nothing short of spectacular, and the visual effects were a treat to the eyes. The concept was mind-blowing and thought-provoking. The acting was brilliant, Matthew McCartney deserved way more recognition for his performance, the supporting casts were phenomenal as well.
it's hard to get tired of a movie that has the combination of heart, brain, and soul. This movie encapsulate Sci-fi, drama and the care of human spirit rolled into one."
" A masterpiece
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,10,A soo good and must watch film science and space explorers will love it so awesome.
" I love this film. I get why some don't.
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,9,"I get why some people don't like this film. It's long, draining, and a little self indulgent in thinking it's writing is complicated so it reiterates its point a little too much, but ultimately I find this movie extremely imaginative, captivating, overwhelming, and visually stunning. It's probably my personal favorite film because the concepts it explores are already extremely interesting to me but we finally have a modern film that captures it so gorgeously and realistically. It has an incredible blend of practical effects, there's homage to scifi classics in the score, characters, and cinematography that gives the film an aesthetic that feels masterful, and classically familiar. The sheer scope of the endeavor is captured perfectly through every actor at every instance. Again this film can be draining but it's equally inspiring. I give it 9 because there are a few themes that toward the end make the film seem convoluted. Sure it comes full circle and makes perfect sense in the end, but the significance of love being equally important to gravity and non linear time, or in Anne's eyes the driving factor to this endeavor being inevitably completed, sidelines the brilliance of the daughter Murphy, and the will of Matthew that allowed the non linear time construct to guide them to inevitable survival. All fathers love their daughters but their own personal facets made them the perfect... tangent. My favorite sci-fi film, purely because of its scope, and how incredible it is to view."
" Brilliantly executed but nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is.
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,7,"You already know what's good about the movie, so let's look at the not so good: it's full of hamfisted plot points.Arguably, it starts off a fun causal loop which I tend to usually enjoy as plot devices. However it quickly devolves into to fairly poorly executed exposition tricks such as an engineer explaining to the pilot the very basics of the flight is just been selected for? Or the very basic of gravity that any astronaut would know about??? Why?You also have a scene in there where the lead takes down an Indian military predator drone with only two young children, a laptop and a Pringle cantenna.So it would be rather wise of the people qualify this as being highbrow 'hard' science fiction to eat a bit of humble pie, as a lot of the story is no more intelligent than than say, your average avengers movie. This isn't primer.Regardless, the direction and the photography are so brilliantly executed that it's impossible not to give this movie at least a seven * rating simply for the camera work and the vfx. It is not, however, the 2001 killer some rave about, and that's not necessarily a bad thing."
" My favorite movie of all time
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,10,"There are countless reasons why I love to watch movies, but Interstellar always reminds me why I fell in love with cinema in the first place.There hasn't been a film which hit me as deeply as Interstellar. The story has so many layers to it and essential themes like the survival of our species, pioneering in order to sustain the human race, and ultimately: the importance of love to humankind.Since it is a Sci-Fi-film, I never expected it to be as emotional, philosophical and touching in its core. The most important message it wants to tell us is to grow beyond us and to face the challenges we are most afraid of. Furthermore, sometimes you have to sacrifice something in order to achieve your goals (Newton's third law).The cinematography is one of the most beautiful of all time which leaves you in awe, the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is simple, yet absolutely breathtaking.All actors give great performances, especially Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, Mackenzie Foy as young Murph and Jessica Chastain as adult Murph.Christopher Nolan crafted something special with this film, invested a lot into research for scientific accuracy, which he used to show us never before seen images which are revolutionary and raise new standards for future space movies.A must watch!"

" Wormhole!
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,7,"Another epic Christopher Nolan brain-twister, this time mostly in space. As a father, the setup is utterly frustrating as Matthew McConaughey leaves his young children behind to venture through a worm-hole to find a habitable planet next to a ginormous black-hole."

" Over-rated for my tastes
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,3,"I cannot believe how many people give this high ratings. Of course that's not bad or wrong -- each person has their own interests.First off, this flick is too long at almost 3 hours. If a story cannot be in film for a maximum of 90 minutes, then it's usually just drawn out & goes into too much boring detail. For example, this film had a lot of time with no speaking. If the visual doesn't tell much, cut it, or combine it with other speaking.I was bored to hell watching this and that was at a 60% faster speed while doing stuff on 2 of my other screens. (I have ADD & my mind goes fast.)Big fail for my interest & attention. Sure, I'm in a minority, but I wanted to put it out there."
" One of the best Movies

" No words to show the greatness of this movie

But for me personally the best thing is the relationship between Father & Daughter."
" realistic science fiction
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,7,It's a very realistic science fiction and beautiful movie. The difficult thing is that it can set these two into one. It teaches a lot about the relationship between space and time. Or it makes people wonder. The final part is a little boring but still worth it.
" Could be worse, but argh, disappointing (again)
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,6,I'm struggling for words: I watched it again (over 3 nights) and I was really hoping for more this time around. But still a disappointment from such grand ideas.Big stars but poor grumbling. Solid FX but was that the point. Drawn out like a bad McConaughey Lincoln commercial.Gave it a 7 last time; lowering to a 6.#argh #ValueYourTime

" Review
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,8,"What a masterpiece!Would recommend!!!Nolan is a genius director.QUOTES:
We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars. Now we just look down, and worry about our place in the dirt.Do not go gentle into that good night; Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here.Once you're a parent, you're the ghost of your children's future.Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends time and space.Pray you never learn just how good it can be to see another face..."

Cinematography 10
World Building 9The Cinematography and World Building was obviously amazing and defining for the last decades Cinema art. However, there were no outstanding characters and acting, so you can see it more as a piece of art than a movie."

",2020-10-05 00:00:00,5,No original story and anything! I wish the movie was shorter. The acting was fine but the movie as a whole didn't make any sense.
" Awesome a films
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,10,"It was one of the rare films that could be watched in the world, the professionalism of the actors and the actuality of the film kept the film up to date no matter how many years have passed."
" Seriously Good
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,8,"This was an interesting movie for me.At the time of watching my daughter was about the same age as the character in the movie, so I found myself inserting into the film and relating to the struggles of the father to get to his daughter.
I have never had this experience in a movie before or since.
So I feel in a way the movie review will be slightly contaminated or influenced by external factors...OR is this what should happen more often?So suffice to say...I really enjoyed it!"
" Interstellar in IMAX is an experience
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,10,"I have nothing more to say about the story, characterisations or the message of the film as all could be said has been. For me, a deftly crafted soundtrack is what turns a good film into a great one, and Interstellar is definitely great! Hans Zimmer + Christopher Nolan has once again proven to be a formidable partnership; the organ piece from the OST playing over literally the most beautiful visuals I have ever seen on screen felt like more than just watching a film. I was lucky enough to be able to catch it in IMAX due to a temporary re-release."
" A Great Premise Poorly Executed
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,7,"6.5/10 would be more accurate.A lot of people love this movie but I came away feeling the lack of .. well, anything solid tying all the component parts together.Good stuff first.This movie is visually spectacular. The acting was good.I loved the concept - Earth is ceasing to support humanity, seven people sacrificed it all to maybe save the human life, and now we have seven worlds out there that *just might* support a human population. It's time to see how they fared.Great setup.I loved the planets and the vastness of space and later in the film, the docking part. I don't care how impractical that might be, it was fantastic to watch.Perhaps oddly, I don't mind the fifth dimension behind-the-bookcase stuff, maybe because I've just recently rewatched Dr Who - The Girl in the Fireplace which covered this scenario very well.The bad stuff is mostly plot holes and puzzling events and characters so weak they pulled me right out of the story.These are the things that bothered me most:Coop thinking he was the target of the ghost's message. I said it out loud at the time, ""It was in Murph's bedroom so she's the chosen one."" Too obvious.How is one planet in a solar system affected by a black hole and not the other two?Amelia Brand - in what universe did she become a science officer? I trusted her until the water planet when she refused to come back to the ship when the wave approached. There's nothing scientific about that, it was a selfish, emotionally-driven act that got a man killed.And immediately after, back on the ship, she's now talking about how love transcends all and that's why they should go to Edmunds' planet?? Ye Gods woman, your credibility is totally shot after that water world ballsup. You've shown what emotion can do.It also puts my back up when the heart-not-head argument is presented by a woman. Women do it as much as men, yeah, but Hollywood gives this role way too much to females. It doesn't make any difference that she turned out to be right. That wasn't proving her point, she was correct by pure accident. She'd been equally wrong just an hour (23 years) ago on the planet. Emotions are important. But not your own emotions at the expense of everyone else's.How did Coop figure out about Amelia and Edmunds anyway?Dr Mann. If he's such a coward, why did he go on that mission? And what did he think killing Coop would solve? As soon as he came back without him the others would start looking. Wouldn't it be easier to say, 'Oh look, the planet isn't viable after all, my bad."" And then go up to the ship WITH THE OTHERS and kill them off up there? He knew by that time that they were a man down.Pet peeve - the awful scene where Mann is trying to dock on the station and they have 1 second to throw some words at him to tell him his danger and what they say is 'Listen to me, Mann."" So many movies do this. HE'S NOT LISTENING ALREADY! Those words should have been ""It's going to blow!""Tom didn't want to leave the farm, he loved it and his granddad and son were buried there. He kept in touch with his absent Dad, he cried for the loss of Jesse, he's always there for his family. So he's a family man, but he refuses to allow his wife and second son medical care, and then won't let them leave the place when a proper diagnosis is made????How did adult Murph figure out that the ghost was her Dad? Why was she willing to burn down Tom's crops in order to rescue his wife and son and then not care that Tom was on his way back and they were still in danger? I fully expected her to shout out to the man to leave without her and she'd sneak out the back when she could. But she didn't.As everyone else has said, if Coop was so desperate to change the past, WHY GIVE CHILD MURPH THOSE COORDINATES?And just what was Dr Brand doing? Maybe this movie was supposed to be a ten episode tv series with ongoing parallels between the Coop-Amelia team (who never developed any kind of rapport) and the Brand-Murph team. The daughter-swap thing was so on the nose that I fully expected it to turn into a major plot point.That said, Murph's final words imply that Coop and Amelia were supposed to be a romantic prospect, despite the Edmunds business? I don't see it. Coop had more chemistry with TARS.Just how did Murph know that Edmunds hadn't survived and Amelia would be on her own?Coop was a shocking parent right through yet the final highlight was a heartwarming moment between father and daughter? If it had been a heartwarming moment between father, son and daughter I could buy it, but he DIDN'T EVEN ASK WHERE TOM WAS! And Tom was the loyal one, the one that kept in touch.Finally - just when Coop and Murph are reunited, she sends him away. Some viewers saw this as a redemption/reunion moment, but I read it as she saw through him, she didn't want him at her death, she wanted him on the other side of the universe. Fair enough too.I actually liked Coop, he was well acted, I was happy to spend nearly three hours in his screen presence. But as the new father of humanity? We're in deep trouble.All in all, very watchable. But not satisfying."
" Flagbearer
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,10,"This film has opened a new pathway for me. I was thinking that i will never get the same excitement and joy from any movie after watching it second time. But no, Interstellar gave me much much more. I thought re-watching something is not worth and simply waste of time. I am glad that i was wrong.I am not going to say anything about the movie itself. I just wanted to express what a key movie that Interstellar is for me."
" The best of all times
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,10,"One of the most (if not the most) inspring movies of all time. It is helping you to think about your way of perception to the life. I have almost certainly watched 100+ times and it just giving me nice time to think about myself, my actions and my plans. Perfect!"
" The best movie of the 2010s decade
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,10,"You may argue that this movie does not make sense, that it is confusing or whatever but in fact everything falls together here and Interstellar is simply a rare masterpiece of film making. The acting is superb (I think only Matt Damon fits better in Goodwill Hunting than in this movie), the visual effects are stunning and the soundtrack is simply a masterpiece in its own right and Mr. Nolan's story telling on different time levels is also brought to perfection. The fact that I missed out on this movie in the cinema is indeed a shame but even watched on TV there is hardly ANY movie which is more gripping than Interstellar. A class of its own."
" That warm light shining at the end of the tunnel ...
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,9,"... captured by sun reflectors ... the main character, sitting on the veranda of a replica of his farm house, transformed into a museum.

" Top 10!
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie is for sure on my Top 10 list.

",2020-09-24 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is one of the best and most beautiful sci-fi movies ever made!! The actors and absolutely fantastic, and Matthew McConaughey delivers his best performance here! The movie has the best soundtrack out of all of Nolan's films. The emotional moments here are so well executed!! The VFX here is some of the best in the history of cinema!! The characters, tone, storytelling, and writing are super compelling here. Nolan knocks it out of the park with Interstellar!! Y'all have to see this masterpiece!! It's one of my Top 3 favorite Nolan films of all time!!"
" Unprecedented!
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,10,"You know, sometimes when you watch a movie for the first time and then 5 or 10 years later you rewatch it, it's not all that good or amazing how you thought it was the first time you watched it. And honestly that is something normal to every human being. We're all in a process in our lives and we change every minute of our lives. But every now and then comes a movie that strikes you so hard the first time around and then the more you watch it, the more you realize just how good it is. That's the case for me with Interstellar. A movie that I adored ever since I watched it the first and second time in theater. A movie that inspired me, a movie that I quote sometimes and a movie that simply put just leaves you wondering about the vastness of space and what could lie for us out there in the sky. Never did I had that feeling of wonder and amazement at space and at what could be out there like I did watching this movie. So, what makes Interstellar such a compelling and amazing movie for me?Plot Analisys:So, the movie kicks off with Cooper, our main protagonist who has a dream about once flying a NASA aircraft. Then he goes and steals a indian drone while driving his car with his son and daugther. And what I love about this scene is that it sets so expertly the tone of the movie, that humanity or anyone for that matter has to leave something behind in order to go forward. And that's a pretty nice life lesson right there. Then he goes to talk to Tom and Murphy's teachers and the feeling I got there was that this movie accurately predicts the state of the world in the future. The teachers apparently try to controll who their scholars will become and wipe the past by replacing it with stuff that actually are more accurate. Anything sounds familiar about that? This is a world that forgot what it was, forgot sacrifices achieved for humanity. It's a great touch from Nolan suggesting that our society is basically just obsessed about the future and forgets and ignores the past. On the polar oposite are the simple farmers that just try to earn a living from harvesting crop. A world of two polar oposites, perfectly portrayed through a couple of scenes of dialogue. So, when Coop gets back home he discovers an anomaly which he fixes but later happens again and this time is in Murphy's room where dust falls only in certain shapes. It's some kind of a gravitational anomaly. So the message in the anomaly is the cordinates to a place. So when Coop and Murphy, who sneaks into his car, go there they find that it's NASA, or what it remained of it. There they meet Dr. Brand and his daughter Amelia. So Coop gets recruited into piloting a sapce shuttle for a mission of saving humanity by going through a wormhole into another galaxy and finding a suitable planet for humanity. So when they get back home Murphy is angry at Cooper and the scene in which they both say goodbyes it's absolutely heartbreaking. Fantastical acting from both Mackenzie Foy and Matthew McConaughey. So, he leaves with his truck checking his front right seat to see if Murph didn't hide there again. Man, what a legendary scene! So the crew of Cooper, Brand, Doyle and Romilly leave to go to Saturn where the wormhole is. During this time there are some scenes of the crew talking to the people of NASA and to their families back home, and although the pacing is a little bit slow here, the character moments are absolutely necessary here. Eventually they go through the wormhole and get to the other galaxy where there's a black hole and three planets orbiting it. So, they go to the first one (Miller's) which is all covered in water but the water is like maximum of 1 feet high. What could this mean? Forgot to mention that the proximity to the black hole makes time slow down to the point in which 7 years pass on earth for an hour on that planet. Well it turns out the planet has huge waves caused by the gravitational pull to the black hole and the scene spent on this planet is absolutely breathtaking. The flawless CGI, the music and the suspence, it's just a masterclass in making suspencefull scene. Then they come back to the space station Endurance where Romilly waited 23 years for them. Interesting to mention is that if you go and listen to the soundtrack ""They're not Mountains"" every tick of the watch in that track means an hour on earth. I mean, it can't get more genius than that now can it? So they decide to go to Dr. Mann's planet next having found out that Amelia is in love with the astronaut named Edmund who is on the third planet. Here we find out more about Brand's feelings for Edmund and that, as she says, is a proof of a higher plane of existance, a proof we cannot understand nor can we understand that higher existance. I mean, how much more can a movie inspire it's audiences than right here? I like to think this is a reference to divinity and how love for us humans might be a proof of that divinity. So after rationally discusing the situation the crew decides to go to Mann's planet. I'd like to point out that these are genuinely some of the most clever and rational characters I've seen in a main stream movie. They always think before acting, they talk through the next steps and they take mostly rational decisions all the time. Yet, the circumstances are almost always against them. And that's a neat message to the audiences because just like in real life, you could take the best decisions, think everything rationally through and still have certain circumstances stand against you. That's part of our growth as persons and human beings. So they go, and awake Mann from hibernation, but then he tries to maroon them there in order to finish the mission and carry out plan B, because plan A was never an option, said Dr. Brand before dying. Turns out he never did finished the equation that would allow humans to manipulate gravity in order to execute a massive evacuation from Earth. So plan B is all that is left. So Mann tries to get to Endurance but he gets blown into space by an imperfect contact. Then one of the best scenes in the movie and one of the best scenes ever happens as Cooper tries to reconect his shuttle to Endurance. He does but in doing so Endurance is now heading towards Gargantua. See how the movie continually pushes it's characters in stressful and difficult situations even though they almost always make the right decisions. That creates real tension and an uncertainty of what's gonna happen next. Can't praise the movie more for that! So they detach two shuttels and escape Gargantua but Cooper decides to get into one shuttle and go into the black hole. There he ends up in a tesseract where he sees every moment of his daughter's life in her bedroom. There is revealed that the ghost from the begining was Cooper all along. And even though that is not hard to figure out early in the movie, the execution is what stands out for me here. It's the emotional connection between characters that make this scene in the tesseract and the reveal all the more powerfull. So while Cooper was in the tesseract one of his robots also went through the black hole and discovered the solution to the gravitation equation. And then Cooper sends that information to Murph via morse code. After doing that he wakes up near Saturn and is brought onto a space station made with the efforts of Murph, and he gets to see her in her last moments as an old lady. And that scene is heartbreaking and tear jearking. And the movie ends suggesting Cooper goes to Edmund's planet to help Brand start the human colony there. And that's it, that's the wonderful plot for Interstellar.End of Plot AnalysisYou know, the thing I like the most about this movie is, well, everything. From the indescribable wonderful music, to the fantastic CGI combined with practical effects, to the dramatic performances from the both leads of this movie especially McConaughey, to the engaging story and the surprinsing twists, this movie is a phenomenon that rarely happens in Hollywood and a future classic for sure. Starting with the music, this is probably Hans Zimmer's best score. The music stirs a sense of wonder and awe about what could be out there in space. It's engaging when it has to, dramatic when there's the case for that and quiet and sentimental when characters go through tough sepparations or emotional reunions. The special and practical effects combine seamlessly and is good to see that instead of overused like in the more contemporary movies. Then the performances. Matthew McConaughey gives one of his best performances, ranging from calmness to rage to crying and laughter all done without a hint of overacting or exagerating. Anne Hattaway starts off as a solid scientist who is cold and calculated, but as things start to derail she starts to show a more human, emotional side, culminating in her feelings for Edmund sealing the decision to go to Mann's planet instead. This movie also has such a comeplling story that is hard even for someone who doesn't understands the physical concepts this movie poses, to not enjoy the movie for what it is: a story about the realtionship between a dad and his daughter. The only gripe would be that the movie doesn't fully explain the importance of the gravity equation for the evacuation of the human race. Speaking of it, even the humans as a race have a character arc in this movie. They start as a race dying and achieve the first step in human trancendence, in that they harness gravity and manipulate it. Ultimately Interstellar is a phenomenon, a movie that is set to become a future classic and a movie the likes of which is unlikely to get made in the society we live in right now. A movie that belongs to a different age in cinema, an age in which characters had arcs, stories were simple and compelling and the plots were complex and engaging. Truly one of the if not the best movie ever made in my opinion! 10/10"

" Yawn.... but
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,8,"If you had a lot of things in mind, you'll have trouble understanding the whole movie. Watched Interstellar 2 times on the theatre, its a thought provoking movie that requires a lot of process. The movie had powerful visuals and interesting storyline that keep me interested untul the end of the story. Can say that this is one of Nolan's masterpiece, the visuals, the score, the acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of the most original I've seen in a while."
" Arguably the best movie of all time
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,10,"If you've ever watched a movie, go watch this movie. Watch it once, watch it twice, watch it a dozen times and it would still amaze you and inspire you and drive you and make you love your near ones just the more.
It's actually got the best of thrillers, sciences, scores, emotions, anti-climax and what not! I know if you watched it you'd agree with me.
Matthew McConaughey is fierce and wonderful, Anne Hathaway is beautiful and strong, Hans Zimmer is expressive and genius, and Christopher Nolan is best in what he does !!!"
" Amazing soundtrack and visuals
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,10,"This film is an experience. Wonderfully constructed, and wonderfully executed. Hans Zimmer's sound is amazing and adds depth and character to scenes."
" Snart moveis
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,10,A very great movie. I was impressed by Matthew's performance with the character of Cooper and Nolan's creativity.
" 1000/10. It's the 1 movie against all other movies. Who gave this movie less than 8 r the idiots who not any knowledge about happening. They r the dumbest asshols
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,10,"I watched most of top rated movies bt this one is the best for me against that all top rated movie's. This movie is beyond the imagination. If Christopher Nolan was not born in this universe then this movie will be make after more 200 years. I just watched that thing which is stucked in my mind for forever. Inception is 11/10 , Shawshank redemption is 12/10, godfather 11/10 the dark Knight is 20/10 bt interstellar is 1000/10. Just watch it in very silently, get proper wording, feel every moment. You will be blown. Thank you"
" Best Movie
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,8,"This is a best movie , and the Visual effects in the movie is very Good."
" Christopher Nolan sure loves time.
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,10,"A theme I've found in most Nolan films is time.
Inception deals with the inflation and deflation of time within an altered state of consciousness. Memento captures moments of time in photographs and tells the story in a chunky interval manor to replicate that of backwards story telling.Now... that being said... the man knows time inside and out. The 4th dimension (time) is a very fun concept to play with once it is understood.Nolan is probably a creature from the future (he wouldn't see it that way) creating these films.He and his brother have crafted this masterpiece while playing in their own sandbox of ideas. Just because the under informed movie goers can't understand this masterpiece doesn't mean it's pretentious or boring. Lord of the Rings wasn't written for Dyslexics.If you want to enjoy this movie as I, 86% of 1,400,000 reviewers, and Neil DeGras Tyson did, research the 4th and 5th dimension.Then watch it again and you'll s*** your pants.Hope this helped.-Jake Jackson"
" A good science-fiction film.
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,7,"Maybe ""instellar"" is an overrated film: some wrote that was the best film they have seen, the most extraordinary film,etc !!
It's a good story with some good dialogues, some nice photographies and some thinkings about the future of the humanity.
I think that the success of this film is also due to the cast: Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain and Matt Damon."

" A miracle!
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,9,"Christopher Nolan's magnum opus is one of the best movies ever made.
Every detail is an example of excellent craftsmanship that combined makes a miraculous masterpiece."
" My favorite movie of all time.
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,10,"I had a special interest in science since my childhood. I tried to read all the sci-fi related books. During the shutdown, I watched a lot of movies as well as a lot of documentaries on science. When I heard that my favorite director Christopher Nolan directed a movie in astrophysics, I was shocked. I watched it as soon as possible. Honestly, I will not skimp on rating 10/10 in each of Direction-Acting-Score-Cinematography. Moreover, it is only possible for Nolan to get impossible details in the necessary places, accuracy as well as not to drag complex science in unnecessary places or take the help of fiction in the interest of the movie. I missed some key points without seeing the problem of sound mixing and without subtitles for which I see it again in print the next day, seeing it properly, I realized that Nolan has created a masterpiece!It will be more enjoyable to watch the movie as a drama without trying to understand it as sci-fi. Because human emotion has been given priority in many cases here. Even in some cases Nolan has ignored science in the interests of the drummer. So in the end Interstellar is more of a drama than a sci-fi, which conveys a more beautiful message about love than many romantic movies. Of all the powerful dialogues in the whole movie, this one seems to me to be the best.Not to mention the soundtrack of the movie. Some music plays with people's emotions, at the same time can bring different kinds of feelings, can put pressure on the nerves. One such score is Interstellar music by Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer, who has previously worked with Nolan on Inception, The Dark Knight, and you must remember what a terribly beautiful creation the music track was.Interstellar's cast made me even more excited about it. While immersed in the true character of True Detective, Matthew appeared in the role of Cooper, along with one of my favorites, Anne Hathaway and Mackenzie Foy, but even if you haven't seen Mackenzie Foy before, you can imagine that this box of cuteness will grow into another Jessica Chastain!It also seems wrong to expect Nolan's movie to be simple linear. Interstellar seems to me parallel non-linear (although I doubt if there is anything with this name). Something happens before, and some happens at the same time. An attempt was made to describe the incident linearly.People reach a stage where they have to be developed from 4 dimensional being to 5 dimensional being. 5D sees time as a dimension so they can navigate at any time. These 5 dimensional human beings are THEY!But time is also a physical dimension for 5D. It's like you can see all the events laid out in front of you, you can see your birth, your school life, your marriage, your death ...As long as humans are 5D, the earth is destroyed, so they are located in another galaxy. But if they come to this other galaxy, it will take a way that was not discovered until the earth was destroyed.Wormholes are a type of quantum anomaly. At the quantum level, it is seen that electrons can move from one place to another without passing any time. This concept is called wormhole. If the wormhole could be created in the form of a mass, it would be possible to pass two light-years apart almost any time apart.It is not possible to create wormholes naturally due to the huge amount of energy and dark energy required to keep them warm and stable. But 5D people have found a way to stabilize wormholes. This time they created a wormhole and placed one end of the wormhole near Saturn in our solar system, the other end in the galaxy where future humans will be.So this time we need to transfer the people of the world to a new place. For this they choose Murph K. Murphy's father, Cooper, is a NASA engineer and pilot, and Murphy is exceptionally intelligent.From Morph's bookshelf comes the Morse code signal 'STAY' which is sent by Murphy's father Cooper, a 5D Tesseract created by Future 5D Human. Because the first time Cooper enters Tesseract, he thinks he's stuck here forever, and nothing would have happened if Past Cooper hadn't been on this mission. Then Cooper realizes the power of Tessaract. Tessaradact is a 5D model, so he can navigate at any time. Grace received the necessary information about the singularity for the Gravity Equation Solve from Tarsus Black Hole, which he was converting to Cooper for Morse and sending to Cooper Murph controlling the second hand of the clock.If space-time is continuous multiverse we can never see another universe but gravitational pull. That's why Cooper uses Gravity for contact.Data from Singularity from Murph Cooper and data from Romley's Black Hole all solve the Gravity Equation, which was started by Professor Brand. It is through the gravity equation that the massive Cooper station and the people of the world begin their journey from the earth to the human new home to use gravity.Meanwhile, as soon as Cooper Murphy finishes sending all the info needed for gravity equation, the purpose of the Tesseract is fulfilled, and the 5D closes the Tesseract and sends Cooper and Tarsus back to Saturn with a wormhole. ('The first handshake as Cooper crosses the wormhole)The Rangers found and rescued Cooper as he passed Saturn at Marfra Cooper Station.Suffice it to say, wormholes are so far only possible at the quantum level. Although the black hole was discovered, no information was found inside its event horizon. The tesseract part of the ending is completely fiction, even if it doesn't say May be 5 dimensions so far only in theory. String theory also speaks of 9 dimensions. But so far nothing has been scientifically proven. Maybe 'they' will answer these questions."
" A big dissapointment!
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,1,"This is a typical movie that only gets high rated cause of its high status maker and actors. The movie itself and its story is just like any budget crap.
Its not logical at all!"
" Matthew McConaughey Grows Up...Again!
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,9,"First of all, it must be said that like so many other actors, Matthew McConaughey, deserves his redemption in movies like Interstellar and Wolf of Wallstreet. This McConaughey film, however, is the first to make us actually care about his character.MM's character's daughter is not a spectacular one, but we care about her beacuse of McConaughey's impassioned performance in scenes like the 5th dimensional portal scene where he is forced to watch himself leave as his daughter insists he not go to space and leave her and their midwestern life behind on a dying planet.Anne Hathaway also puts in a good showing in scenes where tragedy and sacrifice abound.Do you love to hate special effects? In this production, you won't have to. They;re kept to a minimum, and the most special of effects are so funny or overpowering that you won't have the chance to hate them.Ultimately Interstellar falls short of what it could have been, but due more to the shortsightedness of the plot than of the directing or cinematography, which is all above and beyond expectation while exemplifying the dictum of classic auteurs, ""less is more"".In this movie, less is what saves the story, and is what prepares us to take this movie seriously, where nothing really resembles anything from another film out there. Cliches are systematically avoided, and the best lines are reserved for a robot who so intelligent that his wit factor must be turned down to a 1 just to stay on the same level as his heroic, but all-too-human intellects can bare on such a serious mission."
" Such a waste of time
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,1,"I must have missed something because I got nothing but a very long, pointless, boring and uneventful movie on my screen. Talk about love and love BORING!!!"
" Interstellar: An Amazing show of Sci-Fi
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,8,"The movie takes place in a near future where Earth's ecosystem steadily falls apart, the planet's farmers find their crops steadily dying out, hinting at the possibility of global famine and ultimately the extinction of mankind. The population is declared a ""caretaker generation"", tasked with improving sustainability for their descendants, while notions of space exploration and other means of survival are actively discouraged. It's during this period that former NASA pilot-turned-agriculturist Cooper finds himself recruited by a coy astrophysicist to pilot a craft through some newly discovered wormhole-possibly put there by some mysterious form of life-to another part of the universe where potentially habitable planets await. NASA previously sent other expeditions to scope out the planets, so Cooper takes off with plenty of data to set the journey in motion, and several intrepid explorers join him. Among them, the professor's feisty daughter Brand continually challenges Cooper's confidence, while a low key physicist helps explain each new event. Rounding out the group, smart-alecky robot TARS basically a giant, talking iPad with legs-marks the rare instance of levity in Nolan's oeuvre, even when Cooper tries to dial down his irreverent companion's humor setting. There's no mistaking any of these characters for being anything but the bit players in a formula, but they've been neatly calibrated to serve a plot that makes its more familiar ingredients count for something.Leaving his family behind, Cooper is torn between completing the mission as they veer from one dangerous planet to the next and considering the prospects of going home. Untold light years away, his science-obsessed daughter Murph grows up resenting her father while continuing his work and steadily getting drawn into its significance. These ingredients require no deep understanding of equations to follow, and it's their underlying simplicity that gives the more sophisticated developments a sense of purpose.The plot may be higher-than-high concept, but Nolan keeps the world of Interstellar admirably and charmingly understandable. Location shoots in Iceland lend a stunning natural edge to the film's alien landscapes. Interstellar contains without doubt some of the most inventive, immersive and abstract outer-space visuals ever put up on the big screen. Nolan stages one thrilling set piece after another, including several hairsbreadth escapes and a dazzling space-docking sequence in which the entire theater seems to become one large centrifuge; the nearly three-hour running time passes unnoticed. Even more thrilling is the movie's ultimate vision of a universe in which the face of extraterrestrial life bears a surprisingly familiar countenance. It's hardly surprising that ""Interstellar"" reps the very best big-budget Hollywood craftsmanship at every level, from veteran Nolan collaborators like production designer Nathan Crowley (who built the film's lyrical vision of the big-sky American heartland on location in Alberta) and sound designer/editor Richard King, who makes wonderfully dissonant contrasts between the movie's interior spaces and the airless silence of space itself. VFX supervisor Paul Franklin (an Oscar winner for his work on ""Inception"") again brings a vivid tactility to all of the film's effects, especially the robotic TARS, who seamlessly inhabit the same physical spaces as the human actors. Hans Zimmer contributes one of his most richly imagined and inventive scores, which ranges from a gentle electronic keyboard melody to brassy, Straussian crescendos. Shot and post-produced by Nolan entirely on celluloid (in a mix of 35mm and 70mm stocks), ""Interstellar"" begs to be seen on the large-format Imax screen, where its dense, inimitably filmic textures and multiple aspect ratios can be experienced to their fullest effect."
" Nolan's best
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,8,"Interstellar is like nobody else's film. Instead, it claims science will save humanity, unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that use cutting-edge technologies. Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology.
Not everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most ignore it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Compassionate, smart young people convey this feeling. This conviction came about as a result of a worldwide war that swept out the vast majority of earthly lives - crops and individuals.
Although advanced technology is considered frivolous, agriculture is the main-one of the few survivors who understand the need for engineerings, Cooper (McConaughey). Having walked into NASA's headquarters (which had worked illegally because of media disapproval), he felt like a man lost in time. He finds those here who recognize that a return to our traditional ways is futile and eventually leads to our downfall. In order to save us, we need technology. As Michael Caine eloquently says to Cooper playing a genius, Professor Brand: ""We were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."" The sound stole the stage for a film that won an Oscar for the Best Visual Effects. A success which was very accurately outside of this universe, Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy). I never saw a movie lifted by its scoring so far. Actually, the sound stole my breath. Forgive me the paragraph that follows. I'll go through the magic of this film's sound irresponsibly. Yeah, skip it. You've got your warning. Any big scene was driven by music. At every real moment, the harmonies of Zimmer captivated the attention of watchers in order to take on a mentor for a conversation in a locker room. The music shone through those emotional scenes in a manner that could be neither words nor visual ques, especially those featured by Cooper and his family. I was frozen, I was jagged, my cheeks were filled with tears, and my feelings were absolutely overcome by music. The sound entered my mind and spread through my body and brought me consciousness like a rhythm of heart pumping blood into my brains. The music really was the essence of the film's life.
Wow, both of us have experienced a spectacular success, an audacious artistic marvel we haven't seen since the beginning. Yeah, almost every actor has shown a commendable performance. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain flourishes into a galaxy. Michael Cain now exudes wisdom and intellect by merely being on the television, and people would be asking whether it was behind him that he had been cast as Albert Einstein. All this was taken into consideration, and the tone was still overall. I went outside the theater, hoping I had seen something special, something extraordinary. It inspires Celestial, awes, and mostly it entertains. More than that, I can't think."

" Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is the most powerful movie I have ever watched before. This experience is what should define the blockbuster entirely. A brand new idea that challenges the viewer to think, performances that can drive you to tears, editing that feels out of this world, and above all else, a music score that is endlessly watchable that perfectly captures every moment. The drama of this film does not come from a central antagonist, per se (although Matt Damon makes a brilliant villain while he is on screen), but instead, from the simple concept of time.The writing of this whole film pairs with the beautiful graphics to seem extremely scientific, and I would not be surprised if these events could actually happen. So many of the scenes are masterfully laid out, and can be so dramatic. One of the best scenes is when Cooper is leaving, and Murph runs to her father, crying, only to find that he's not staying for her, even after she told him to go. This film is even more powerful later on, when we find out that the person knocking the books off of the shelf, telling him to ""stay"", was actually Cooper, in the future. As the music builds, Cooper is shouting and crying because he knows that this moment could have been prevented, and he would have seen his daughter grow up, but now he will never be able to do that.This is a story about a man who sacrifices everything in his life, for everybody else's life. Learning that the mission was never supposed to succeed is a genuinely fascinating twist, and watching the betrayal on Murph's face as she finds this out is yet another brilliant scene. Matthew McConaughey is so unbelievably perfect in this film, and he seems so genuine of a person that it's hard not to feel bad for him. Every other performance in this music is so unbelievably good, even down to the minor characters. The twists in this movie are beautifully done, and make the movie shine as bright as it possibly could.What absolutely sells the experience is the beautiful sound track by Hans Zimmer. Every piece of music is intense, tear-jerking, and unequivocally beautiful. This movie is an absolute gem and deserves many rewatches. How on earth this film was not even nominated at the academy awards is absolutely beyond me. This is the greatest science fiction movie I have ever seen in my life, and this is certainly Christopher Nolan's Magnum Opus."
" More than a film.

Thankyou"
" Mind blowing
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,10,"I went into Interstellar with high expectations due to the story concept and director Christopher Nolan's history of great films. I got the brilliant story and visual spectacle I was hoping for, but I didn't expect the gut wrenching emotions the movie would put me through. It's true that despite being a masterclass of visual effects and spud design, the emotions in the film and the incredibly talented actors that portray them are the main reason to watch this film. It is an unforgettable movie."
" Unpopular opinion: not that great a film
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,7,"I had heard a LOT about this film, and how people had to watch it several times to fully grasp its complexity. I came to the film with tons of expectations but it was kind of a letdown.
Half baked characters, especially the women. I am not qualified to question the science, so not getting into that at all. What I can say is that the motivations of characters are extremely sketchy. Emotions are not Nolan's forte. The scenes in which characters wax poetic about love are just bad."
" FLAWLESS!! Nolans at his best!!

" Interstellar. (2014)
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,10,"Powerful pictorial science fiction epic with a demanding, critical and interpretation rich story, with which Christopher Nolan gives his personal answer and bow to Stanley Kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey."
" An absolute science fiction masterpiece.

",2020-09-01 00:00:00,9,"This isn't a movie, it's art. What can I say about Interstellar that has probably never been said about anything else I've reviewed? It's a landmark in film history. This film is so flawlessly made. Christopher Nolan has reached that point. I can't wait to see what he does with Tenet.The story takes place in the future, where Cooper and his crew must explore a wormhole in space in order to save humanity. It's survival. I loved this film for so many reasons. When you watch a Christoper Nolan film, you can expect it to be fantastic in visual terms. I didn't see this in theaters, which is my biggest regret. I watched the 4k Blu-Ray which looks magical and stunning. The visuals are glorious to look at, the audio and Hans Zimmer's terrifying but beautiful score is out of this world, and the film is one to be remembered for many years.Matthew McConaughey is brilliant. So is all the other cast. That scene of him watching the videos on the ship always gets me. This film is emotionally draining with its scenes. It's not an action film, it's a slow science fiction masterpiece. The only problem I have with this film is its long-running time of 169 minutes. There is some material that could've been cut down. But overall, this is a film. It's a shame this wasn't nominated for Best Director and Best Picture in the Academy Awards.Overall, Interstellar isn't a film, it's an experience. It's an emotional tale of humanity's survival and the goal to make it through. I love everything about this film. I cannot wait for what Nolan will do for Tenet."

However more visually because Hans Zimmer orchestra is mostly boring and generic and is used too much and too often in the film or in most Nolan-movies.
The US propaganda was added subtly by Christopher Nolan.7/10"

" Sci-fi
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,9,"Nice movieThe Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn't give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.It's possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that's dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) & Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it's the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.Those in support aren't faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the ""Birdman Of Shawshank,"" Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood & Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there's Roger Deakins' lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman's score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy's state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.If you love Shawshank then it's a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us."

" What a stellar movie
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,10,I watched it again recently and I found it even better than the first time. There's so much of everything in it. And with Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway you have two actors who are outstanding even in this exceptional cast. You want a no brainer? Watch it. You want a sophisticated story and something that you can reflect on for a long time? Watch it. It works anyway. I love the robots (but all the technical details seem extremely well thought out).
" Best theater experience
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,10,I was dragged to this film by my friend when it first came out. I hadn't watched the trailer nor known that Chris Nolan has directed another movie. We watched it in 70 mm IMAX in San Fransisco and it left me awestruck. It was by far the best cinematic experience I've ever had.

",2020-08-24 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is an astonishing sci-fi film that's thought provoking, emotional, breathtaking and complex. Matthew McConaughey gives an incredible lead performance and Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, Mackenzie Foy and David Gyasi all give great supporting performances. Christopher Nolan's direction is phenomenal and with Hoyte Van Hoytema as director of photography, consistently visually stunning. The visual effects are flawless. It's extremely well paced and the music by Hans Zimmer is beautiful."

" Absolute Masterpiece.
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,10,"It took me 6 years to finally catch this one, but what a grand movie it is.
The cast is second to none, as are their performances, the cinematography is superb, the storyline is complex yet clearly exposed... There are a couple of slower moments, but no dragging moments, the score by Hans Zimmer is probably one of his best ones of all time. It takes you on a journey, deals with issues we can clearly envision as part of our potential future, explores philosophical concepts but never stops becoming an incredible entertainment piece. 100% recommended... if you like movies that challenge you at least a little bit. I can see this being a little too involved and demanding for some folks, but those who get it are in for a top level experience."
" Glad i didn't watch the trailer
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,10,"I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema.Nolan's masterpiece, one of the best sci-fi movie"
" Lots of (non-black) holes in the plot
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,6,"""The Time Machine"" meets ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" It's difficult for most people to comprehend the concept of a Black Hole and differences in time passage affected by space travel. While those elements are central to this movie's plot, the story also focuses on a man's relation to his family and a dying planet (Earth) where people try to pursue their normal lives despite Dust Bowl conditions and a dwindling supply of food (to incurable diseases which have wiped out wheat and other food crops) and availability of breathable air. Add to this the story element that the best space jockey in the world quit NASA (because of some questionable flying decisions) to become a farmer like his ancestors. Then he stumbles upon a secret government facility which is preparing to send a ship through a Black Hole to find three earlier probes which went to three different planets that might prove to be suitable for resettlement for dwellers of a dying Earth. He is immediately put in command of this mission although he didn't even know about it until yesterday, basically because of his fame as a great pilot. The plot gets even more involved as he and his top research companion and the oddest robot ever to appear in movies attempt to visit the three planets and determine which, if any, is suitable for earthlings. The rest of the story is too difficult to explain, let alone comprehend. Just remember that quantum physics, Black Holes, time travel and the lot, like theology, are sometimes incomprehensible for many, if not most people, but it you sit back and aren't too critical about obvious non-black holes in the plot, it's an enjoyable, if longish, movie to watch."
" Great Movie!!
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,10,A great movie with great acting from everybody and my favourite soundtrack of all time.
" Masterpiece
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,10,"Yeah, I read lots of reviews. The good, the bad and the ugly. It seemed to be a polarising movie, 10/10 or 1/10. The fact that Matthew McConaughey was in it pushed me to give more weight to the 1's. How very wrong I was! In the end a friend recommended giving it a go, and I was glad he did. Great story, great action, great adventure, dare I say great acting (yes) and a SUPER ending. I don't think any more could be added here without spoilers, so I'll just say do yourself a favour and try this superb movie
PS: That Matthew bloke was amazing in this!"
" WOW
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,10,"An amazing move! It's definitely in top five!
The plot is intricate and very enjoyable.
The acting is quite good but not remarkable, but the story gets over it and you'll not notice it.
Well, there is a oversight but it doesn't bother (family truck).P.S. If you are searching for a movie with a light plot that does not request attention and with short length this will be definitely NOT the movie you are seeking for. Nolan's works require attention and some mental effort to comprehend them at all (and I love them for it)."
" Everyone should watch this peice of art
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,10,"I regret that I did not see this masterpiece in its time, especially this movie which I enjoyed in all respects, the greatest soundtrack, The interconnected events are insane, the creative representation of all the actors from young to old, the manipulation of time is one of the great things in this movie, finally the ending I did not like it. Because it is unreasonable"
" The best movie I have ever seen!
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is a work of art, without exaggeration! Thanks in advance to Cristopher Nolan for this film! It is a film full of emotion, surprise and rationality! It is an example of overcoming and devotion to the survival of human life. It is a complete complete film at all levels, made even more incredible by the soundtrack made by the legendary Hans Zimmer. All the actors were phenomenal in their work! It is, without a doubt, the best film I have ever seen in my life. It was a crime to have been a film ignored by the Oscars!"
" The best movie I have ever watched
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,10,There are no words to describe this masterpiece. I just remember back in 2014 having watched it 7 times at cinema! I wanted to enjoy every moment Interstellar was running.
" An unexpected experience
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,10,"For me its not a movie its a way of seeing our near future. This piece have something unique. Even in the beginning we can see Nolan is trying to make us feel that there is something wrong about this whole mission and the idea of getting humans a new home. We feel the pressure of every second because for the space travelers... every second matters and one little mistake could end the hope for all the people that they left back in Earth.
My Overall Thoughts:
Watch this movie as an experience of we can have to face in a near future. And feel every second as a meaningful moment to every single character of that piece. I repeat. THAT IS NOT A MOVIE"
" Stupid desicions and flat story breaks this beatifull movie
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,4,Just watching this movie after six years. And just my mind is blown away by how stupid some characters were. The story at times feels incredebily dump for ideas it tries to put in. I guess people were more able to close the eye to dumb storytelling just for the spectacle. It dont aged well.
" Best sci fi, period.
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,10,"One of those movies closest to my heart. Sci fi can't get better than this. Everything is amazing. One of the best movies ever. Matthew McConaughey is a gem, and so are all the other actors in this movie. There's no scope of complains, at all."
" Finally, I found the answer üôÇ
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,10,"Well, I will be very brief. I found the answer of one of the most difficult questions: ""What is your favourite movie?"" For me it was one of the toughest questions 'coz there was a time I watched like 100 movies on an average per month. And I'm so glad to finally find the answer and thanks Mr. Nolan for that. I can easily give 10 stars to the movie only for introducing me to the concept of five dimensions. For other aspects of the movie, I wish I could give the movie a 11 or 12 out of 10!"
" Bad writing
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,6,The script is really bad. Other than that it's pretty good.
" Marvelous , breathtaking and super stellar
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,10,"Quite easily the best movie I have seen in my life . As a student of science, I couldn't have appreciated it more."
" Best product of Nolan
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,10,I dont think so Hans Zimmer knew his own skills. His contribution to the movie is remarkable. The background score was so lit that i actually felt that i was in space. Nolan direction is unquestionable. It could not have been better. It is clear that he has done so much research. Every minor detail of the film was perfectly sculptured. Doesn't felt like it is such long film. Took care of attention to detail. Probably the best sci-fi ever.
" WOW
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,10,"I was speechless when I finished this film, the story, acting and visuals just seem to good to be true.
For a film with such a big scale, it does a great job establishing the world and characters, it can be a lot to take in bit there is just so much emotional payoff that it makes it worth sitting through 3 Hours of film.
I won't spoil anything, but the ending is just perfect. It makes you want more from the film but in a way that doesn't make it unsatisfying.I really have no complaints, it does everything it sets out to do, it is a real shame this didn't win any Oscars."

" A Flawed movie but still a wonderful experience
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,6,"Released in 2014, this Nolan sci-fi adventure flick starring Mathew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway took the world by storm. Grossing over 600 million, it became a huge hit proving once again Chris Nolan can't fail in the box office department. But is it good? Great? Hmm Yes and NoThere are many things that I loved in the movie. The most obvious thing is Hans Zimmer's score which was truly a breath-taking one. You could tear up just by listening it. The next thing was McConaughey. A wonderful performance. He truly had an excellent couple of years with this, Wolf, Dallas Buyer's Club and True Detective!! The visuals were excellent as well. It was marvellous to look at. The thing I loved most was Nolan's insistence that the movie is as scientifically accurate as possible. Not a lot of mainstream filmmakers do that. So what I am saying is technically it is almost perfect. There were a couple of scenes which I really loved like the video cam session. Truly heart-breakingAnd there were quite a few things that bothered me.From now on there will be SPOILERS!!Most of which are to do with writing. There are a lot of exposition scenes that were handled poorly. What I mean is exposition scenes can be executed flawlessly if it fits the situation and the characters but in this case it felt off. Here the exposition feels directed more towards the audiences than to the other characters which make them unnatural. A couple of the many examples: Scientists explaining Black hole to Mathew's character on board the spaceship. Cooper saying that they are the ghosts of their children. I mean what is this!! Why should he say that? Thematically yea we got it already no need to say it and logically it just doesn't fit in.Treatment of Casey Affleck's character: This may be biased because I am a huge fan of him but he was handled poorly. In the final act he is made to be a basic Hollywood villain who tries to stop the ""good guys from saving the world"". Felt like soap opera!! And when Cooper finally reunites with his daughter he is barely mentioned. Why??Handling of the LOVE IS THE ONE THING THAT ISNT QUANTIFIABLE theme: I don't have a problem with the theme but the way it was introduced suddenly out of nowhere and also Anne Hathaway's character literally spelling it out felt so forced and bad! There was no reason for her to just breakdown and tell that. Sometimes I feel Nolan has to dumb down his material so that the main stream audience can understand.And coming to my biggest gripe with the movie, the entire 10-15 minutes finale. That is after Cooper communicates the formula or something to his daughter. Then everything went wrong! I mean he literally moves heaven and earth to find his daughter but he talks with her for like a couple of minutes and then goes back to Anne Hathaway's planet? Why? I don't think Nolan directed the two in a sort of personal way. There didn't seem to be an attraction between the two characters. Seriously Nolan can't direct emotional feelings in camerawork. So again it felt too much Hollywoody!!But still a pretty good movie and ambitious as well. It was an awesome experience to watch it because on the surface level it is pretty cool. An awesome blockbuster but nothing more. This movie has absolutely no business in being compared to 2001 as 2001 was just an open piece of art that could just be interpreted in many ways and it dealt with a lot of broader concepts whereas Interstellar confines itself into a small box and explains everything in it without room for imagination or interpretation.But still overall a really good movie with a solid premise but falls short on execution.
A 7/10 from me"
" Greatness of the universe
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,10,"One of the best (and for me it is the coolest and most inspiring) films about our universe, the power of human aspiration, secrets and family.

It's a pity that there aren't many such films being made now."
" Mind Blowing Movie.
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,10,"This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 97 out of 100"
" Beautiful and Stunning
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,10,"First of all I didn't watch this film in a IMAX Theater but yet I felt the magic of this film.
The Soundtrack deserves an A+ .
Hans Zimmer made something magical in the films soundtrack that just sticks to your head and captures the reality of space.
Christopher Nolan's Direction is fantastic and this movie made me feel in love with him.
The performances are equally stunning and great.
This movie has a certain vibe to it that make it very magical and stunning.
This film was robbed of its Oscar's but I feel happy knowing that people talk about their theories and How beautiful this film is now.
This film was way ahead of its time.
Words cannot describe this film.
Even though many people point out flaws in this film no film is absolutely perfect but this is as close to perfection we can get in my opinion.
Mesmerizing."
" Cosmic
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,8,"Somehow, I'd missed ""Interstellar"" up to this point, so with the cinemas in the UK tentatively reopening after Covid shutdown, we decided that the IMAX presentation of the film would be a good way to ease ourselves back in to going. Whereas I had some issues with the film, as an IMAX presentation it was certainly an experience.Set in the near future, where a blight is systematically destroying all the crops of the Earth. The remnants of NASA launch a spaceship on a multiyear mission to investigate whether any planets on the other side of a newly appeared wormhole are suitable for human life. This ships designated pilot, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) must decide whether to sacrifice time with his children in the hope of saving the human race.You can't argue that ""Interstellar"" isn't good. It is top notch in every aspect of filmmaking. The visual effects, the score, the performances are all spellbinding. This is one of history's greatest directors bring us his version of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" - with all the layers, expressionism and concepts that the inspiration has. It also operates as Nolan's love letter to his daughter, about the time he sacrifices away from her to make his movies and how he feels about that. It is a masterpiece.All that said, I didn't love it. Not the way I have done other films, not in the way I have done other Nolan films - and I'm hard pressed to explain exactly why that is. I feel . . detached from it, somehow, maybe there's slightly too much going on? Maybe it's a little contrived at the end? Maybe it's a little too similar to ""Contact"" as well as ""2001""? I'm not sure. I can see the brilliance of it all, but it's something I appreciate rather than adore."
" Instant classic
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,10,"By his ninth film, director Christopher Nolan had already secured his position in the cultural limelight with excellent films and significant blockbusters such as The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception, and more. Following these massive hits there must have been high expectations for his 2014 sci-fi epic Interstellar, and not only did Nolan not disappoint, but he knocked it out of the park. For a director with such an astonishing career it is hard to pick a favorite, but for me Interstellar would have to take the cake.Interstellar is a rare film that excels on every level. It is not difficult to compare it to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, for Interstellar achieves a similar sort of awe and wonder in its use of groundbreaking visual effects, genius scoring, and epic scale. However, I dare say that Interstellar is a better film than even 2001. For as stunning of a spectacle as Interstellar presents, it is overshadowed by its masterful storytelling. This is a film with very real stakes, stakes that never feel manufactured, and are always at the forefront of the story. There is a very real sense of urgency, an urgency that is brought off of the screen by everyone involved.It is hard not to be moved by Interstellar, because it is a film that doesn't go where you expect it to go. There are no guarantees, and that makes the struggles of the characters all the more real. It's easy to become involved in our character's mission, because even though the story is massive in scope, it is also intertwined with our protagonists in a very personal way.It is safe to say that the more you put into Interstellar, the more you will get out of it. It is a surprisingly grounded and very emotional story that is complex, but always logically sound, confusing at times, but never incoherent. It will be a great experience no matter how you watch it, but I have to recommend that you give it your utmost attention. Interstellar is an excellent example of a modern film that will go down as one of the greats."

" Everything went wrong
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,1,"I believe this screenplay came about when director Nolan met M Night Shyamalan at a party and jotted down a bunch of ideas for a sci-fi movie that Shyamalan got after drinking half a pint of vodka. The screenplay contains all the weirdness and confusion you find in a bad Shyamalan film. Add some rather boring action, and you get 'Interstellar'. What is this mess of a movie? There is enough material here for an epic sci-fi, a drama, a supernatural thriller, and an action movie. And that's a bit too much. There are too many plot lines and tonal shifts, and it doesn't help that the whole thing is way too confusing for anyone to comprehend what's going on. How many philosophical issues does this film raise, anyhow? Next time, try one. Not twenty. And try and provide some emotional payoff in the end. I can't believe this film got such good reviews. It is amateurish nonsense."

" Maybe the best sci-fi movie
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,10,This movie is perfect in my opinion.The first movie that made me actually care about the relationship between two characters in a filmI know the the library thing might be a turn off for some people but not for me
" Long, Boring and lame.
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,1,"This film was an extreme disappointment for me. I admire the special effects, those were amazing. Everything else was garbage. The story is based on science, but it breaks so many physics it hurts my eyes. In the end it appears it's about ""love"" and not science at all. Cinematic experience some say, oscar bait I say."
" I cannot explain
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,10,"I am writing this after treating for the umpteenth time? I can't speak for everyone, only myself. As a lover of physics, science, the unknown and the human condition I found this movie profound!
I am an atheist and this movie is the closest I have ever come to a religious experience, I found it utterly mesmerising and more of a love story between a father and a daughter than an out and out Sci-fi.
That being said this movie is going to age like a fine wine, we will be looking back at this is years to come and discussing it in collages and universities across the world.
As much as I love all of Nolan's work to date, I cannot see him beating this in my eyes."

",2020-08-05 00:00:00,10,"This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christopher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not"
" Overly technical and sometimes confusing as to where they were, and time frame.
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,8,"Overly technical and sometimes confusing as to where they were, and time frame. How did Cooper get rescued? The movie was too long and padded with unnecessary detail that didn't add to the story. However, very different and you want to watch it to see how it ends up. Maybe a second viewing things will come into perspective better. If you start watching, stick with it."
" one of the best
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,10,"One of the best films I've ever seen, the cast is incredible, the visuals spectacular and the soundtrack is mesmerising; even when there is no soundtrack, and it is utter silence due to the film being set in space, it adds even further to this masterpiece."
" Multiple Viewings Required!
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,10,"This is a film that deals with cliched issues like Global decimation and overpopulation maybe not today but definitely in the foreseeable future. The space travel is the reason I watched the film. I had to watch this film once when it came out a second time immediately after it dropped on Blu Ray and streaming services and I still want to watch it a 3rd and 4th time just to experience the wonderful acting, cinematography and visuals again. Christopher Nolan knocked out of the ballpark definitely not his greatest movie ever but yeah I can see top 5 Inception and Dark Knight are better."
" AWESOME
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,10,This is the best movie I have ever seen.Nolan tackles the concept of time and how different it is from what we perceive.It was a blockbuster movie-going experience.
" The best science fiction movie I have ever seen
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,10,"A very beautiful movie, explaining about space, time and beyond. It is a mind boggling movie which will keep you sit tight even after the film ends, to think about the facts shown here. In one word, it is just ""Awesome"" and as always a very good presentation by Christopher Nolan."
" Just Mindblowing
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,10,"As an Scifi movie it just outperforms. The way direction and writing of this movie performs its just seamless, not even for a second you get bored and even if you are not a science guy you will just love the movie and the perfection of it. Every scene every fictional thing was made so perfect and the way the actors performed it ...just brilliant."
" Wow. The music.
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,10,"Everything is extraordinary in this film. But the man, the music is just outside from this world literally. My heart was pounding in several moments and that's because of music. Wow. Just Wow."
" The art
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,10,"This is not the movie! This is art. Best of the Space Science Movie. I watched it 4 times without getting bored. Also, their music was amazing. Using Kip Thorne's knowledge is a great idea!"
" donot go gentle inti the night
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,9,"Introduction: Don't walk meekly into the good night, the day is approaching, and the twilight years should still burn and roar; rebuke it, rebuke and rebuke the disappearance of the light, the wise men compromised with the darkness at the end of their lives, their language has been eclipsed, and they do not want to be confused by the night, Roar, growl and shrink backThis poem ""Do not walk into the good night meekly"" that appears repeatedly in the film is written by the author Dylan Thomas during the critical illness before the death of the poet's father. The whole poem is full of night and day, darkness and light, gentleness and The duality of violent, death and life makes the tension of language very full.
It was mentioned many times by Professor Brand in the film. This is not only a summary of his decades of trying to solve the equation about the destiny of the entire human race, but also his unwillingness to withdraw and accept the fact of his failure at this time. Helpless, it is his hope for the future of mankind.Interstellar is a movie that is very worthy of digging. Here I will explain it into the following points1 backgroundThe background shown in the film should be in the near future. At that time, due to the environmental crisis, a large number of plants were afflicted with blight, so that people's basic needs could not be guaranteed. As the film said: At that time, everyone It is a farmer.Due to the pressure of society, aerospace industry and education can only give way to people's basic survival needs. However, this involves a very interesting topic: to save mankind from the current predicament, only to put the line of sight into space again, and the public does not care. At this point, all we care about is the basic need for food and clothing. This is a set of contradictions that are very difficult to resolve. 2 SurvivalWhether it is for people on earth or for Dr. Mann, what the people do is the instinct of human beings as living things: survivalHowever, after all, human beings will not wait to die, so scientists launched the ""Lazarus Project"", which is to send 12 scientists to a certain planet to detect whether the planet meets the basic conditions for human existence. However, waiting for these pioneers or embarking on the journey alone, this is also related to the lies of Dr. Mann behind.Lazarus is a character recorded in the ""Gospel of John in the Bible."" When he was critically ill, he died before Jesus was cured, but Jesus concluded that he would be resurrected. Four days later, Lazarus walked out of the cave. Prove the miracle of Jesus.3 Single-choice questions given to humans by plans A and BTwo plans proposed by Dr. BrandA: Find out a way to crack the gravity formula and save the humans on the earth. This is also the reason that Cooper left his daughter and embarked on the task of saving mankind. For him, it was to open up the future for his children.B: Abandon humans on Earth, open up alien colonies, and bring human fertilized eggs, so that the human race will not be extinct. However, this seemingly cold plan B has become Bran before Cooper leaves. Dr. De's only answer to this question is that the astronauts and people on Earth don't know it.
4 Love and connection ghost (ghost)For the last human beings, it is not the so-called plan that really allows us to get out of the predicament, but ""love and connection"" is embodied in the film as the connection between daughter Murphy and father Cooper (the watch for daughter).
There is also the ghost that has always existed with Murphy. It is this ghost that guided Murphy and Cooper to NASA and solved the gravitational formula to create the future for mankind. Behind all this is the incomprehensible five. Humans in three-dimensional space.After having a child, parents will become ghosts of the child's futureIncluding Dr. Brand's belief in his loverThis is the answer Nolan gave us: love5 Murphy's TheoremMurphy's Law: If there are two or more ways to do something, and one of the choices will lead to disaster, someone must make this choice. The basic content is: if something has the possibility of going bad, no matter how small the possibility is, it will always happen. ToHowever, Murphy's Theorem does not necessarily refer to the occurrence of bad things. This is why Cooper named his daughter Murphy. It is her small probability event that saved all mankind.
6 Science involved in the filmI am a liberal arts student, so naturally I don't give too much guidance on the scientific theories in the film, but it's okay to mention it.Morse code binary five-dimensional space black holeOf course, in order to satisfy hardcore movie fans, Nolan specially invited scientist Kipthorne to interpret the science in the film ""Science in Interstellar Transition""7 About timeThe watch Cooper gave his daughter when he left. Cooper said that maybe we will be the same age when I come back. However, because of the time difference caused by gravity, 23 years later when Cooper and his daughter are the same age, he still doesn't. Come back, and at the end, time is no longer important, because love is eternal8 The display of five-dimensional space and the special effects of the filmFor us three-dimensional creatures, time seems to be a hurdle that is difficult to cross, and it is difficult for us to break through it. However, for human beings in five-dimensional space, time can be represented concretely, just as for them, it is just from one mountain to another. Just sit on the mountain. The film also shows gorgeous and dreamy time in five-dimensional space9 Hans Zimmer's musicI always think that what distinguishes a work from being excellent or real is music that leaves a mark in my heart. I clearly remember the music played when Cooper and his children drove across the cornfield to chase the drone at the beginning of the film: ""Cornfield Chase"" was my heart being gradually ignited and immersed in the film.And when Cooper docked the spaceship, ""No Time for cautiou"" also gave me a real appreciation for the role of the soundtrack. And my admiration for Hans Zimmer. The mutual achievement between him and Nolan will inevitably become a film and television story. spread
10 EndingAt the end of the film, Cooper reunited with the elderly Murphy. Although it was many years away from what they had expected, the father still fulfilled his promise of his daughter.And Dr. Brand has once again embarked on the path of explorationShe is still in space, building a camp, alone in a strange galaxy, maybe she is about to sleep for a long time, bathed in the light of the new sun, in our new homePersonally, I should not cry more than five times in my movie-watching career in the past few years, and when I watched interstellar, I shed tears with music three times. This is still the Nolan I love. Six years later, on August 2, 2020, it touched me again and exuded the unique charm of the movie.
At the end, I will share with you my favorite line again as usualLove is an eternal force, capable of transcending all dimensions. When I return, you are already dying, and I have passed your whole life with one breath."
" Amazing!
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,10,This film is absolutely incredible! It explores so many interesting topics including the power of love to bridge time and space. It also has incredible cinematography and manages to have some really funny lines as well. I've watched it twice so far and gotten completely different things out of it each time. Will definitely come back to this film.
" Well, after you've seen it for the sixth time.....
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,10,"First time you see the movie, it is briljant. The 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th time, it is just beautiful. All time favorite! Saw it for the 6th time tonight! Loved it as always!"
" A movie you can watch over and over again
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,10,Best movie 10/10. The soundtrack is amazing. Cinamatics are gorgeous. The actors are wonderful.
" They!!!!
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,8,"The meaning of ""They"" was pointed very creatively in the movie.
Also very smartly, highlighted the reality of human tendency.
Some times i feel, nasa encourage producers and directors to Produce such films on purpose.
To let the people gather some strength, to digest the upcoming truth they have already achieved."
" 31/7/2020
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,9,I love Christopher Nolan now. I feel like I was in a black hole really. I think I will watch it million times and I am not gonna be bored.
" Interstellar Theory
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar is a brilliant sci-fi movie about time and what it does to us. But Interstellar cannot be taken at face value. In fact, I have created a theory on what this movie is truly about.Interstellar is a movie about mortality and the frailty of humanity. The clues are all there for us to find, but the true meaning of it all is hidden behind the superficial story.The first clue is the state of the planet at the beginning. Crops are slowly dying and people are starving. Clearly, this is a major symbol of death, and Matthew McConaughey's character wants an escape from it all.So he goes out into space, to try to save the planet, but also for the selfish reason that he wants to escape from a life where he was slowly dying,But even in space, he runs into his planet's mortality. He must find a new habitable planet, but one by one, he finds out that nothing will stop death from finding the humans.Eventually, he finds a planet that will sustain the humans. He ends up going into a black hole and literally traveling through time to avoid the death of the human race. Even then, as the humans come to the planet, only a few can come. The majority of people die.Then, the most important clue, the movie ends with both him and his daughter dying. In the end, it was all pointless. They both die no matter what he did.Also, note that when he finds the tesseract cube that lets him speak to his daughter, there are no humans there. They all died. It makes no difference whether or not the humans find the planet.In the end, this is the sad story of how the humans all die eventually, no matter what we do. But I think that makes the movie better. Noticing the little details makes it cooler to watch the second time around."
" Absolutly worth a watch
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,9,"An incredible well use of music and sound makes this movie one where you are on the edge of your seat when Nolan and Zimmer wants you to be there.
Just amazing use of sound and in some cases absense of sound.
Some og the sience stuff seemed a bit far fetched, but them again ended picking up the plots in a fine way.
Absolutly worth a watch"
" My favourite sci-fi film
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,9,"This is one of the most beautiful films ever made, the cinematography is stunning. When I watched at the cinema I was on the edge of the seat for the entire movie. The soundtrack is amazing and so simple but so powerful.I have one tiny gripe which is why I didn't give it a ten, I am not sure about the sequence with Matt Damon in. It just jars for me against the rest of the film. It's by no means poorly acted or badly shot, I just find that sequence out of sorts with the rest of the movie."

" The music shivers my body
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,10,"The music is the most important aspect on this film. Kudos to the composer. I just bought my surround system and everything was clean and exhausting in a way the film wants to be delivered. Yes, it's one of the best scores."
" One of the Best Sci-Fi Movies ever!
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,9,"A beautiful masterpiece. As a father, the underlying story of the lead character's love for his daughter is endearing to say the least. Very well casted and the actors did a great job. The special effects alone make this worth watching. However, it's the story that's beautiful. For a true Sci-Fi lover, it's candy. As a pastor, the reliance on science to solve all issues was a little shallow, but such should not take away from the fact that the movie is nearly flawless. I think I remember only 2 inappropriate words, which for Hollywood is squeaky clean, no sex scenes, and it's positives so outweigh any possible negatives.... as to render them inconsequential."

" another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar is such a powerful movie, with a powerful story / plot and a powerful drama story.Many people talked about how long the movie is but I didn't mind that at all as long as I don't get bored and I didn't get bored at all. I enjoyed the entire 2h 49m.The first 41 min of the movie were kind of an ''introduction'' and we were getting to know more and more about that journey and what might happen and really loved these 41 min, the movie was building that real slow and gentle without it being boring, it was so good.The story and the script of interstellar were so very beautiful and really well written, felt like the story was so very deep with its meaning and with just everything, I really don't know what else to say.Interstellar's music score was so fantastic, deep and did match with every single scene, It was composed by Hans Zimmer so...what's new, Hans Zimmer always blows our heads.Choosing Mackenzie Foy as the ""young Murph"" and Jessica Chastain as the ""older Murph"" was a very great choice, its like when Mackanzie Foy grows up she'll actually become Jessica Chastain with her attitude and with her look and with just everything. Matthew McConaughey was of course incridble, great acting and he gave us an amazing perfomnace that deserved an Oscar nomination at least. Anne Hathaway wasn't a problem at all, her acting was pretty good but her character was the problem, ""Brand"".
Brand was a weak character, at first I really thought that she'll have a bigger role and specially that she is played by Anne Hathaway, I just didn't feel anything towards that character and felt like she was like any other character in the movie. Michael Caine (plays Professor Brand) was a great choice and his acting was good.The Visual Effects were so mind blowing, I even felt like they were all real and no CGI were used to capture these scenes in space, dafiently deserved an Oscar for that.The Production Design was so very good, wasn't surprised that it was nominated for an Oscar. It was so beautiful. The Costume Designs were okay the only thing that grabbed my attention was Cooper's (played by: Matthew McConaughey) jacket and hair style was pretty cool and did suit him well. I mean the whole movie they go to space so space suits are the only thing they wear so I won't talk about the custom designs.Interstellar is a masterpiece and a movie that I really really enjoyed from beginning to end, hats off to Christopher Nolan and to the whole cast & crew.My rating is: 9.5/10"
" Pretty good, but wasted opportunity
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,7,"I gave it a 7, because I find some of the relationship dynamics in the movie to be an unnecessary irritation. The movie could have been a masterpiece without the histrionics. Maybe they just didn't ring true, or maybe they didn't add much to the story. Maybe (in the case of the daughter) it was just so much negative-feeling bunk that really distracted. It's too damned bad. This is a large-canvas film and it was diminished. I *think* that's because instead of infusing our characters with some nobility, we were treated to whining, and supposed realistic human behaviour. I gotta say, if you're aiming high, don't sabotage your attempt with the low human characteristics. Give us something to feel good about. This movie seems to be about people attaining their goal despite being 'merely human'. Darned shame, wasted opportunity. I felt irritated often, throughout the movie and didn't feel like cheering, at the end. Great cast, though. Even Matthew McConaughey had his more irritating acting twitches reigned in by Christopher Nolan's directing skill."
" ""masterpiece""
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies i ever watched, you will enjoy every min out of it"
" Beautiful!
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,9,"For a Nolan film, heavy on the drama side.
This film is not as heavy on the thinking side of things, as it is more a story about the love between a father and daughter.
The plot was interesting and fairly easy to get, but it followed the typical ""looking for another habitable planet"" plot as seen in many space films. Not saying I didn't, it was great. The whole ""fifth dimensional"" and time travel aspects of it were intriguing. (I'm a sucker for endings of movies which reveal holes earlier in the movie, which you can only understand by finishing the movie).
Probably one of my favorites from Nolan, not to mention GORGEOUS.
Matthew McConaughey is phenomenal, it's difficult to complain about him in really any of his films. The side characters were solid, Anne Hathaway delivers in a not-so-huge role but she's still there.
In the end, a very entertaining piece with lessons to be learned with every re-watch."
" So bad I DNF
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,1,So ridiculous I could not get past 38 minutes...DO NOT waste your time !
" An Incredible Film
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie was of the best movies that I have ever seen.
Interstellar was the most beautiful story about life and the incredible who could be the universe. The actuation of Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, and Michael Cane, it was awesome.
My favorite element about this movie it been the visual effects; it was difficult to make out about the reality of the fiction.
If you like amazing stories, this movie is for you."
" Better than 2001
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,7,"About half-way through this I thought ""this is a masterpiece"". The combination of scope, ambition, cinematography, acting and other elements was just compelling.Sadly, for me, somewhere in the second half this feeling went away. I didn't get bored as such, but it lost me (or I lost it) and by the end I felt unsatisfied and a bit disappointed. Possibly more for the unrealised potential rather than anything I can clearly articulate as a criticism.The great thing about Nolan is his level of ambition and with this he certainly succeeded (in my mind) in making a better film than 2001, which for me doesn't even have an ending at all, let alone an unsatisfying one. Normally, I'd say that I'd have to watch this again to really make up my mind... but firstly that would be a serious investment of my time and secondly and more fundamentally, I know I will never recapture that feeling of the first viewing, so I'd rather not try.There are so many great things about this film, though, that I'd unreservedly recommend it to anyone yet to see it."

A minor gripe though for such a cool movie."

" Overrated!!
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,6,"This film was too long, tried to be too clever. It was an hour too long- it was only saved by the ending but just. I'd watched this when it first came out- I was underwhelmed after watching it. I've just rewatched it again 6 years later and it's even worse. I was so bored- I couldn't wait for it to end. Just caught Rambo 2 on tv afterwards and just 10mins of that was way more entertaining.Like Dunkirk- it's just style over substance- I like Nolan especially what he did with Batman but I do think he's slightly overrated. Once you remove the hype- his films are good but not great."
" One of the greatest ever - only movie which is closest to The Shawshank Redemption in greatness.
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is an experience beyond all experiences. I & my wife watched this saga on big screen in Indore, central India & we were mesmerised. After that I watched many times on TV & without doubt I have loved it every single time. Our existence, purpose, Universe, life, love & the purpose of it all. Nolan this is your masterpiece & best ever. Don't go gentle into the night."
" A Big Bold Movie
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,9,"I have seen this movie numerous times now, and it has reserved a special place for me. I was not very interested in science until watching this movie for the first time my freshman year in college. After watching, I was sent down a path that led me to getting a B.S. in Physics, and now I'm pursuing my doctorate in Physics. The science in this movie is not necessarily science fiction, while mostly theoretical and also Christopher Nolan taking creative liberties here and there. This movie is the brainchild of a Nobel prize winning Physicist, Kip Thorne, who worked directly with the film. The science in the film, time dilation, comes directly from Einstein's theory of special relativity and has been proven experimentally over the 100 years since its been theorized. The cinematic of the black hole, Gargantua, comes directly from Kip's theorized predictions using Einstein's general relativity equations to predict how light would behave near such a massive object. Wormholes remain unknown to exist, but are theorized. And if you fall in a black hole, it is unknown what's on the other size, perhaps a 4 dimensional bookcase, who knows.As for the movie itself, it is a great movie in my opinion, but not as profound as the science it tries to depict. Before Cooper leaves Earth, it is a somewhat choppy storyline with weird plot holes. But the idea that the Earth is dying is a necessary pre-factor for the mission to space, which is where the movie shines. The scenery in space, the shots of the spaceship flying in front of the black hole, the planets geology, all made me fall in love with the film. The ending, when Cooper falls into the black hole is like a psychedelic journey into the possibilities of what could exist in the universe. When he sees his daughter after their mission to save Earth, it shocked me the first time I saw it, and it was even more shocking when I learned that that is a real Physical phenomenon, albeit only occurring in extreme scenarios. The bits and pieces in between are somewhat irrelevant to me, I love this movie for the things mentioned above, not for the storyline. I haven't seen a film since this one that has been so inspiring and eye opening, for that reason it is a 10 for me."

" I'm not a Nolan fan, but this is good
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,7,"It's an epic sci-fi colossal, with huge production, perfect direction and great acting performances. ""Interstellar"", even if it has some problems related to the script, it's more than ok!"
" Ambitious Sci Fi Epic
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,7,There are some interesting ideas and some great moments in this original piece of work. Ultimately it doesn't quite get there for me though in terms of the overall story and the science. It's ambition together with some decent performances along the way elevate it into the above average bracket.
" There's only one word: Perfect!!

" The Greatest Space Movie Since 2001: A Space Odyssey
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,10,"Nolan's vision is flawlessly executed in a thought provoking and heart breaking film with epic special effects and one of the Matthew McConaughey's greatest performances. The planets and realms on screen are unlike anything seen before it. It's intriguing and smart. Not quite space accurate, but it doesn't really matter. The film takes us to places we can only imagine and puts them on the big screen."

" ETERNAL FATHER DAUGHTER RELATIONSHIP BEYOND A SCI-FI SAGA
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar is another masterpiece by Christopher Nolan. Albeit it is a hardcore sci-fi cinema (with spaceships, wormholes, black holes, time variation due to astronomical differences) but, the main concept of this movie is the father-daughter bondage and this bondage faces perhaps the weirdest challenge due to the astronomical circumstances. This movie also shows a future food scarcity due to unsustainable life of human being and how science could take steps to prevent such debacles.The movie sets in a future dystopian world (about 50 years from now) where the human race is facing a severe extinction due to several downfalls and debacles due to unsustainable living. In 2067, only CROP is the last viable corp Joseph Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a former skilled NASA pilot and engineer, now a farmer who faces trouble in his farmland due to corn blights and dust storm. He is a father of two: a 15-year-old son Tom (later Casey Affleck) and 10-year-old daughter Murphy (later Jessica Chastain). Cooper has a comparatively good bonding with his daughter who also has some engineering talent like him. Interestingly, this father-daughter duo finds an interesting gravity variation that leads to geographic coordinates. One day, they follow the coordinates and finds a secret NASA establishment headed by Cooper's former boss Professor Brand (Michael Caine). His daughter Dr Amelia (Anne Hathaway) is a promising team member of this NASA scientific establishment. They want a skilled engineer cum pilot for their upcoming mission and Cooper is the best choice for them. Cooper doesn't want to leave his family, especially his daughter. Murphy cries a lot to stop him. But, in order to save the human race, he agrees to participate in the mission. Murphy later becomes a scientist of NASA for the sake of her father. Professor Brand has two plans: Plan A involves developing a gravitational propulsion theory to propel colonies into space, while Plan B involves launching the Endurance spacecraft carrying 5,000 frozen human embryos to colonize a habitable planet. At the initial stage, the astronauts were not sure which plan was viable. And for this reason, they face an enormous challenge from unthinkable sources and manipulative information. The only thinking of Cooper is to return to his daughter which lasts till the end of the movie.The acting of ensemble casts was well predicted and without mentioning anything. The chemistry between Matthew and Mackenzie Foy as young Murphy was superb, natural and emotional. The expressions of Jessica as elder Murphy to his father was outstanding as well. Matt Demon has a skill of playing both positive and negative roles with utmost sincerity.The cinematography and visual effects were outstanding. When the audiences watch this movie, they feel themselves on the land of those planets and that's the success of the technical team.This movie was equally critically and commercially successful and it is the 10th highest-grossing movie in 2014. At the 87th Academy Awards, the film won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and was nominated for Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing and Best Production Design. This film also won the BAFTA award for visual effect. Mackenzie Foy won the Teen's choice award"
" It's good but flawed
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,9,"The most glaring is Murph getting so angry when the elder Dr Brand tells adult Murph on his death bed that he was lying all along, and that she was thus abandoned by her father Cooper.The problem being, she's a PHYSICIST who's been working directly with Dr Brand for YEARS and she didn't figure out it was a sham, yet she believed Cooper was in on it. Her father, who she knew had like a day of notice about the entire mission.I can buy her getting upset when Dr Brand said that, and maybe even her freaked out message to the younger Dr Brand, but she keeps the anger and unless it on her brother.That's the most glaring personal thing. From technical pov's, they need a Saturn-V class rocket to launch from earth, yet they can land and DEPART a planet with such a gravity well that time is 7 years per relative hour with a lander craft about the size of a Cesna. Ok..."
" Fantastic Movie - great effects!
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,9,"This is such a wonderful vision of possibilities, all based in what matters most - love. They did such a beautiful job of bringing cosmic possibilities into our reality, all with the premise of showing the part of life that is invisible to us but has the most powerful and profound effect on us as individuals and as a race - love. It's a great story and awesome premise - that love is beyond time and space and IS a dimension of reality that we don't seen to understand from our limited human condition. Highly recommended!"

",2020-07-12 00:00:00,9,"One of the most captivating films I've ever experienced, Interstellar truly accomplished it all. This movie solidified the fact that Oscars are a sham. From Nolan's masterful vision to tremendous performances from McConaughey, Hathaway, and Caine to one of the greatest film scores of all time?? The sound environment was absolutely mesmerizing and really put Interstellar over the top for me as a Sci-fi flick. A truly astounding piece of cinema and probably my favorite space movie ever made."

" A wonderful movie
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,9,"The structure of this movie is still accelerated by the parallel montage which is commonly used by Nolan, and the final reversal is also considered as the loop type. Very traditional Hollywood genre film writing, details and foreshadowings are definitely textbook-style levels, and the theory is not difficult to understand is not the point, because the core of the story is always love."
" Masterful

" ENDING EXPLAINED in one paragraph; ridiculous plot and ludicrous ending; nice father-daughter but not father-son love transcending time and space message
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,3,"I came to re-watch this film after I re-watched The Martian (2015). So I came with high standards.The Martian (2015) was actually mostly based on real science and it was a well written and produced film. I gave it a 9/10; lost a star for some scientific inaccuracies.This garbage on the other hand was the most absurd piece of writing I have ever seen in my life. Jonathan and Christopher Nolan must have had a crazy cocktail of dr*** in their system for them to come up with this foolishness. They took a couple theories and then let their imagination rampant with them to create obscene fiction.Ending explained:
So some guy is inside a black hole's point of no return and he finds himself inside a 5-Dimensional space built by HUMANS from the future and from there that guy somehow communicates to Earth in morse code to the FUTURE (his daughter is a grown woman). But this is not the first time he has done all of this traveling and ""communication"" because he has already done this whole trip and ""communication"" in the PAST (his daughter is a teenager). Then the guy is saved by the future humans and take him to their floating ship/home and somehow his daughter is now an elderly woman in that floating ship and she has a dozen family members. What? And then the guy leaves that comfortable floating ship and goes to the planet he was originally searching for that was basically like Earth. Credit: thanks to the site LOOPER for the explanation of the absurd ending.Theory of relativity? Gravitational time dilation? Wormholes? Time traveling to the future and the past? No wonder nobody cares about cosmologists or astrophysicists or takes them seriously.Now the Nolans took astrophysics and then just let their insanity run unstoppably. Escaping a black hole's point of no return without a scratch? Communicating from a black hole's point of no return to Earth to the future AND the past? 5-Dimensional space inside a black hole? The whole plot is about helping humanity find and get to a ""second earth"", but instead once they escape they decide to live in a floating ship? Why did the daughter end up on a floating ship and not on the ""second earth?"" Why is humanity not living in the second earth???The plot might have sounded cool and interesting ON PAPER when the Nolans pitched it to the producers and it may have been a cool sci-fi novel to read, but as a movie it was just obscenely crazy. This movie was only a success because Matt Damon and Matthew McConaughey are in it and because the love aspect of the film was strong.The one thing I will admit was a strength of this film was the LOVE between the father and the daughter being able to transcend time and space - that was absolutely beautiful and touched me. That was the only redeeming quality of this movie's plot. I do not understand why he did not have that connection with his son though. Regardless, that demonstration of love was beautiful and powerful and surely touched all viewers.Conclusion: most preposterous and nonsensical sci-fi movie movie I have ever seen. However, I did like the father-daughter love connection that transcended time and space.3/10"
" In space no one can hear you speak
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,6,"I found this movie at Walmart for only 5 bucks, I checked here for the rating and bought it.
Unfortunately, it is a low volume movie which I hate, every character in this movie speaks at the same volume...low.
When I'm not struggling to hear the dialogue there's a lot of crying, men and women & children...a lot of wet faces.
Seems to me a chick flick...no wonder it was in the 5 dollar section at Wally world.I love good scifi movies, but this ain't it IMO"
" Stunning
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar is Christopher Nolan's sci-fi epic, inspired by the likes of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. I watched this movie for the first time a while ago, so not every detail is fresh in my mind, but it is very memorable and I have something to say. I think that everybody should watch Interstellar. It is one of those movies that everybody deserves to see in their lifetime. The premise of the movie is that Earth is dying, ""the Blight"" has basically destroyed almost all remaining food sources, with corn really being the last big plant. The movie focuses on Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, an ex-pilot for NASA who is now stuck farming (something he does not enjoy), and his relationship with his daughter Murph. The acting by everyone in this movie is phenomenal, and every relationship is painstakingly crafted. We get a good chunk of time on Earth to set up everything that will happen later in the movie. Eventually, we go into space, where we get some of the most realistic theoretical physics in any sci-fi movie. Everything in space looks amazing, actually the whole movie does. Christopher Nolan used no green screens when making this movie, and it shows, because all the sets are fantastic. The cinematography, tone, directing, and color palette are all perfect here. Everything about the look and feel of this movie is done perfectly. As for the story and screenplay, those are also done wonderfully. Even though this movie is 2 hours and 49 minutes long, it holds your attention for each and every second. You could allow yourself to get confused by all the physics trying to work it all out, but the emotional core of this movie within the story is captivating.That leads me into one of the biggest points about this move, the score. The score for Interstellar done by Hans Zimmer is my single favorite movie score of all time, with First Step basically being my favorite piece of music ever composed. The score fits the movie perfectly and adds so much emotional punch to an already emotional movie. There is one scene that is so emotional, and had me on the verge of tears the first time I saw it. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I don't want to spoil anything, so I apologize if I'm not going in depth, but I think everybody needs to watch it. Even if the big sci-fi physics aspect isn't your thing, it has such a strong emotional core. Some people aren't the biggest fan of the ending, but I had 0 problems with it. My only complaint is some of the characters aren't super developed, but that is such a minor flaw in comparison to how much I love this movie.Interstellar also has some things that could be interpreted about the death of film (like I said everything that could be done practically was done practically, and the movie was shot on celluloid film) and movies being plauged with digital and CGI. I think it's a really fascinating and important message that works well within the film.If you're thinking about watching Interstellar, go in with an open mind, as it actually seems to be pretty hit or miss for most people, but for me it was definitely a hit. Interstellar gets a 9.5 or 10/10, I'd need to rewatch it to decide which."

" Unforgettable Experience
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,10,"What Christopher Nolan accomplished with Interstellar will go down as one of the most astonishing space odyssey's ever created, even more beautiful than the late great Stanley Kubrick's; whom many consider to be the greatest/most influential film maker of all time. However, where 2001 undoubtedly has many dry spots, interstellar keeps you hooked from start to Finnish; and it will instill a new concept of how time and gravity can be intertwined and a fresh twist on the theoretical physics often being played with in sci fi novels. Interstellar contains a perfect blend of music/acting/writing/cinematography/directing that truly come into fruition during the Space station docking scenes. I often compare Interstellar with 2001: A Space Odyssey but in reality they're two completely different films, what truly pulls the two towards one another is their ability to inspire. We won't know for another 5-10 years but interstellar may inspire a generation of filmmakers to set out to achieve their own ""Interstellar""."
" The best big screen experience of all time
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,10,"This is for the Nolan fans. It is not a movie, it is an experience. The movie starts with a gradual pace and goes on to increase the tempo until the very end. It keeps you on the edge of the seat. There are some scenes that you just cannot ever forget in your entire lifetime. It leaves you with a feeling of wanting more. The adrenaline pump of watching this movie on an IMAX screen is next to unbeatable. Thank you Nolan"

",2020-06-29 00:00:00,10,"I felt compelled to write this review after watching this movie. Originally watched this in cinema when it came out. I remember walking out the cinema knowing there'll never be another movie made to this level. Waited roughly 5/6 years to rewatch this, and that feeling of pure amazement returned. Brilliant performance by McConaughey. Probably one of his best performances of his career. Nolan really out did himself with this. The science behind it is beautiful and not corny where it turns unrealistic. The small preview of his portrayal of the 5th Dimension is visually astonishing. A run time of 2 hour 49 Minutes but feels nothing like it. Not a minute in that movie where you feel ( that didn't need to happen ). If you haven't watched this movie yet, for whatever reason. Please spare 3 hours and enjoy some of the best screen time your ever going to witness."

" Classic Nolan
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,9,"Not just Christopher Nolan as the director, but also the cast with a brilliant Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway just make this film amazing. This is a film you'll regret not having seen in cinema because the visualisation of the outer space is breathtaking with it's beautiful shots.
The story, to be honest, is exciting and well written but complex especially at the end, so don't be surprised if having to watch it several times to fully understand. Very typical for Nolan...
Moreover, ""Interstellar"" has a gorgeous soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and is, all in all, definitely a must see. Go for it!"
" Doesn't get better than this
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,9,"From one of the most vaunted filmmakers of our time, comes another intellectually challenging flick about space exploration, filled with notions of physics that are not known to mankind yet. I'm not one of those fanatic Nolan fans who love anything he may throw at them, and I am one of the very few who felt Inception was ridiculous. And yet, Interstellar is one of the best movies I have ever watched.In the near future, a blight that survives on nitrogen starts destroying all the crops and our Earth is no more an inhabitable planet. Humans have no choice but to look to the stars for other places for survival. Our hero, who is a former pilot and now a farmer, sets out on this quest with a team of astronauts, leaving behind his family.The Bad:
The first half doesn't feel like a Nolan movie. The panache that appears in his other works, especially the sense of seriousness and hurry, is surprisingly missing. There are long conversations without any background music, that makes you wonder why music composer, Hans Zimmer, who usually goes for the fast beats, has toned down the music so drastically. Parts of the movie feel maudlin, with arguments like ""love is the one thing that transcends space and time"", but the script makes sure that there is someone to counter such arguments with more rational ones, even if the movie doesn't agree with them. The one problem that always existed in Nolan's scripts continues to fester here: characters explaining the plot and the rules to each other, in order to let audience know, even if its obvious that they shouldn't need to explain it to each other. Since this is a movie with esoteric physics concepts at its core, there is a lot of mutual explanation between scientists that doesn't make much sense.The Good:
It does not suffer from one of the biggest problems I feared it would: logical errors. Even though it may seem a little far-fetched, the logic seems sound. Einstein's theories of relativity are extensively exploited, and at times these concepts even elicit emotional responses. The movie also ventures into more opaque fields of theoretical physics, which pique your curiosity to learn more after watching the movie. There are moments such as the spacecraft leaving earth where the music and direction couldn't have been any better. The second half is as gripping as it gets, with scenes interleaving between different spaces and timelines, with numerous challenging but well-crafted scenes, stunning visuals, riveting music, and a couple breathtaking revelations. The robot TARS, with its bare minimum appearance, adds just the right amount of levity to several moments of otherwise monotonous dialogues in the first half. This is one of those movies where every aspect of the film has to be crafted perfectly and put together beautifully in order for it to work and Nolan is just the man for the job. From Hans Zimmer's music to Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography to Matthew McConaughey's acting, there is a perfect conflation of skills to make the movie what it is.Although people do a lot of nitpicking when it comes to Nolan's movies, the plot of this movie, is scientifically possible, even though highly improbable, and the logic is irreproachable. I've had to ponder for a while to make sense of it all but that's what makes the movie so great, that it leaves you thinking about it long after its over. I will give it a 9 on 10. Must watch.Rating: 9/10"

" great
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,9,"The rigor of the plot is nuanced, and Nolan manages to keep the logic intact, whether it's the storyline before and after the plot, or the science of celestial gravity on time. The story behind the progress, not complex but shocking. Under such extreme circumstances, human sacrifice, perseverance, faith, reason and persistence, which constantly shine with humanity, bring people warmth and hope in the cold and heartless outer space."

This movie needs to be watched more by our generations cause everyone must see that physics is not that scary, instead, it's exquisite!Even my sister's physics tutor watched and recommended Interstellar. Worth to give it a shot."
" Why a 9 and not a 10...
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,9,"I am a scientist and this movie is mind blowing. Soundtrack perfect, special effects perfects...the plot perfect..makes you want to explore the universe....but the writing is not that good. I ve seen all C. Nolan movies and this one is not as well written as The Prestige or Dark Knight. The actors were all ok but not outstanding. Some cheesy dialogue was not necessary. The ""wave scene"" is epic as well as the docking scene. If the writing was better I would give a 10 so a 9 is my vote."
" A Visually Stunning Sci-Fi Film
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,7,"Christopher Nolan's Interstellar is not a perfect movie, but it was a very memorable experience watching it the for first time. The visuals in the movie are truly spectacular, mixing CGI and practical effects very well to produce some of the most visually stunning scenes ever put on film. The soundtrack from Hans Zimmer is memorable and definitely one of his best scores. All of the performances from the cast are great as well.The first two acts of Interstellar are fantastic, but the third act is where some flaws come in to play. Without spoiling anything, I'm just going to say that some of the concepts in the third act just come off as stupid. The script could also use some work. In addition, the film seemed to go on for a little bit too long. The final 10-15 minutes of this film felt unnecessary.Interstellar isn't one of Nolan's best films, and I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but it's something that I can watch countless times and never get bored of. Despite me having a few issues with the movie, this is a great film that you should check out if you haven't already."
" It's a masterpiece.

",2020-06-13 00:00:00,10,"This is the best movie EVER!!!
The direction, cinematography, screenplay, acting, music(Hanz Zimmerüòò) and the STORY, everything about this movie is soo perfect. When i first watched it in 2014 i was just 18 and I was in absolute awe! I watched the movie for 4 times in cinema with 4 different people explaining the whole movie to them(everyone cannot understand the movie).
From Cooper leaving murph to going to miller's planet then returning back 25 years later to Rom and then going to Mann and the betrayal. The blackhole and 50 years jump and finally the reunion! The movie is an emotional ride than a scientific one. The best movie EVER!"

" Interstellar
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,10,"I was extremely lucky to get the chance to see this film upon its first day release, before entering the cinema, my expectations were already high, after all, this was a film from the cinematic genius who brought us the likes of 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', to summarise the following review in a single sentence: I left the cinema in extreme awe from the visual masterpiece I had just viewed. A film that explores the psychological and emotional state of a man whose life revolves around his family, 'Interstellar' is a thrilling and thought-provoking film that boasts an intellectual story masterfully written by the Nolan brothers. Whilst there seems to have been influence from films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Apollo 13', 'Interstellar' is unique in its own way. Whilst the subject may be hard to comprehend at times, it can't be denied how visually monumental and thoughtful Christopher Nolan's epic science fiction masterpiece is, and can easily be named the best film of this year and possibly one of the greatest science fiction films to have ever graced the screen. A sheer brilliant feat of cinema."
" Always come back to!
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,10,"I always come back to this film, there's just something about it which is so good. The characters and plot are perfect and I continue to watch it over and over again."

",2020-06-06 00:00:00,10,"No more information is needed. I expected a good movie, but not THIS good. Nothing was expectable. I was sitting on the edge of my seat during the whole film. It has everything. It was emotional, thrilling, scary sometimes and adventurous. Recommended!"
" A masterpiece too big for small minds.
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,10,The film of the decade. With themes that are still considered taboo by fanatic religious or ignorant people!
" A true journey
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,"Despite its obvious flaws such as some plot holes and cheesy scenes, Interstellar takes you on a mindblowing journey.
Matthew McConaughey does an amazing job portraying Cooper and helps to make him a believable and interesting protagonist.
Of course, you have to mention the music. This is Hans Zimmer's masterpiece. It fits perfectly and it really stays with you. Now everytime I look up to the stars or solve physics problems, I hear this music in my head. Sounds cheesy, but it's true because the soundtrack fits SO perfectly.
It's my favorite movie by Christopher Nolan and one of the best Sci-Fi movies."

" Good film but..
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,7,Interstellar good film but last scene is stupid i dont understand but i like it of course watch this movie
" What a trip
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,10,This movie even became more intense after a became a dad.
" Nowhere near Nolan's best.
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,5,"There is science fiction, there is space opera, there is science fantasy, and there are superhero stories. The reader or the viewer needs to make a judgement about what kind of story they are in and dial the suspension of disbelief to a level that works. Is this 2001, or is this Star Wars? Once I know what kind of universe I am in I am cool and set my expectations accordingly.
Interstellar tries to be at the science fiction end of the spectrum and fails miserably. It's like watching the 1960s TV show ""Lost in Space"" except that the protagonists are idiots this time.
That is my major beef with this movie. A more minor issue is that rather than letting the camera tell the story, Chris Nolan subjects us to what seems like days of exposition which turns out to be meaningless science babble anyhow. The soundtrack is impressive only for its dynamic range. The film was shot and edited so that it only really works visually in IMAX. Good for 70mm film activism, but bad for Cinema. (The last film that touted 70mm as a selling point was ""Far and Away"". 'nuff said.)
Aside from that, Matthew McConaughey does a great job as Cooper and Anne Hathaway is more than convincing as Brand. If you can get over your anger at the first two and a quarter hours, the last 35 minutes is actually pretty good and satisfying. There are a couple of very good ideas in this film and they come to the fore at the end.
I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan as a director. Other than ""Batman Begins"" and ""Inception"" all of his other films that I have seen are outstanding, and ""Inception"" is more than good. ""Memento"" is a masterpiece. This movie is Nolan's ""Waterworld."" BTW ""Waterworld"" wasn't nearly as bad as everyone seems to say."
" Fantastic sci-fi I've ever seen
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,10,"Christopher Nolan, Black hole, space dimensions, time dimension, space-time, gravitational time dilation, gravitational waves to communicate, classical physics, quantum physics, 3d space in 5 dimensional reality, gravitational anomalies. You name it you have it. What's not to like. I've never studied advanced science ever in my life. But after watching this movie I can confidently say that I have a fairly good understanding of the mind bending theories of both classical and quantum physics. The tidal waves in miller's planet was quite awesome. And the mission module' s plunge into the gargantuan black hole at more than the speed of light was a spectacle that has never been seen previously in any movies that I have watched. Interstellar I would say is the movie of the decade thus far. Thank you Nolan for taking us all on an expedition to find a planet to host humanity."

",2020-06-02 00:00:00,9,This movie is one of the most underrated movies of all time. It goes really deep into space and how it twists time so many times in the movie the black hole scene is just incredible how they could make something that could be possible in black holes. And how they went from planet to planet and all the different settings this movie is underrated
" An exciting movie
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,9,"I want to give 100 stars, which is probably the most shocking movie I've ever seen. By the end of the movie, we are still crying.

Of course, there are many descriptions of love in this movie, and the role of emotions in the meaning of life is also very clear. The meaning of life is definitely not simply pursuing a certain goal or struggling to sacrifice for a certain concept. This also includes how to live the emotions of a colorful and fascinating life."
" love
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,8,"This story is a true love between father and daughter through time and space. Although the theme of ""love through time and space"" has been ruined by countless romantic fantasy network novels, this film can make people cry hard, because it is so pure and true, and our lives are so similar. Cooper did not embrace ""my journey is the stars of the sea"" ling yun ambition, just want to finish the task as soon as possible back to her daughter to accompany her growth. In the fall of human crisis, Murphy's ultimate haven is still the place where he and his father have the most memories."

" Best science fiction movie ever
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,10,"In my opinion,Interstellar is one of the best movies of Christoffer Nolan so far. Interstellar is a sci-fi genre movie in which the character played by Mathew McConaughey named Cooper lives a very normal life and where the earth's food resources are dying out and weather is becoming very nasty, so he goes out to space with the help of NASA to find a new habitat for the next generation of humans. To do that,he also had to say goodbye to the family for there better future, so he bids goodbye to his beloved daughter Murph and his son which is bittersweet. He goes out to space with a team and a robot named TARS which I found hilarious.From there the journey starts and it tells a story about how Cooper finds out that a new planet will not solve the problem of their habitat but a new dimension would and lost some of his friend on that journey. Interstellar is a movie which is a combination of emotions and science with astonishing visual effects that makes this film a must watch."
" Awesome in every way
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,10,"Not much to say other than I have now watched this film at least 20 times and love it more with every viewing. Utterly brilliant in every way and Hans Zimmer's score turns it from a 10/10 to 11. If there is a better movie in my lifetime, I haven't seen it"
" This is what I call a perfect movie.
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar holds a special place in my heart. If you haven't already, WATCH IT. It's truly amazing."
" THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN !!
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,10,Brilliant Movie. I Am Just Attached With This Movies. The Powefull Thing Of The Movie Is The Orignal Score. Great Work by Hans Zimmer.
" Great Movie
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,10,"Well it is one of the best movies i have ever seen, the cast, screenplay and music is so awesome..but the thing i dont understand, at the first planet that they have visited, they say 1 hr at that planet is 7 years in earth time.they stay less than 1 hour. but when they come back it is 23 years and 4 months which means they should spent more than 3 hours at the planet ??And i have also realized no one is using cellphones in the movie, is there a purpose i dont know but it is great :)"
" Nice Science-fiction Movie
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,10,"Excellent Science fiction movie, Little Hard to Understand,But after research about Worm holes,Black Holes and some Einstein's theories, this movie is very interesting,
I'll definitely watch this movie again,"
" Classic
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,10,This may be one of my favorite movies of all time. If you like science fiction and end of the world movies then this is for you. The acting is superb and the storyline is captivating.
" Too long and boring!
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,6,"Just felt like I lost a few years of my life. That's how long I felt the movie was. It started off to be promising but then got absurd and more. Towards the end, it didn't make sense to me at all. I do enjoy all movie genres provided they engage me with a convincing storyline. But this was a disappointment for me. I kept looking at the time and couldn't believe I still had half of the movie more to finish. Glad I didn't watch it in the theatre, it would had been a torture!"
" Pretty sights and a booming soundtrack can't make up for dull pacing, flat characters, a predictable plot and contrived cheese.
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,5,"MY BACKGROUND:
Considering all the intense feelings around Christopher Nolan that often rear their enraged heads through online amateur reviews, I must profess where I stand from the outset. I am neither a ""fanboy"" nor a ""hater"" of the Nolan brand. I prefer his work up to and including The Prestige, but not much of his work afterwards, so any overall attachment balances out. I don't feel as if I have something to prove when watching or discussing his films.That said, I am a science fiction fan (""fan"" with a lowercase ""f"" if you know what I mean; don't expect me at the next Comic-Con) so I thought this might make for interesting viewing. Lately I did some layman reading on cosmology for an unrelated project, so either I knew enough to grasp the scientific concepts in the film or I was delusional enough to believe so.THOUGHTS:
Not impressed.We start off with a dry, dusty, dismal, dying future where the protagonist (played by a perpetually bored Matthew McConaughey) struggles to keep up harvests on his family farm. We are shown (i.e. beaten on the head by) suggestions that a ""ghost"" is pushing books off his daughter's bookshelf. At that point I hoped that the climax would not involve the typical sci-fi transcendence of space and time, with the protagonist becoming this ""ghost"" and using his new-found cosmic powers to push some books around. But more on this later.From that point the film reveals two of its biggest flaws - bad pacing and bad characters. The family spends a long time going through exposition, bonding, baseball, education issues and hacking an Indian drone but never build much of a substantial relationship in the viewer's mind. It just serves to repeatedly hammer in the superficial point that the protagonist is an all-American family man who loves his daughter, but not much else.After a very long time we finally get to something related to space and the premise when the protagonist stumbles upon a top secret NASA base. The scientists all unquestioningly conclude that his finding of the base must constitute advice from magical gravity beings (what a scientific deduction) and hire him as a space pilot for a world-saving mission almost on-the-spot. Yet even after launch, the film still drags on to a degree I haven't seen since The Lord of the Rings trilogy. What follows is more plodding filler scenes in orbit, near Saturn, in a lab and so on. Due to the effects of relativity, each hour passing on a watery planet they encounter is the same as seven years passing on Earth; due to the effects of slow pacing, each hour watching this movie certainly felt like seven years too. And this is coming from someone who could tolerate the pacing of Solaris!At some point on the water planet a crew member dies, but I don't remember his name, appearance or role since they were all interchangeable humans. At no point did I care about these bland, personality-deprived non-characters. This extended to the maudlin moments where the protagonist would mope over his daughter or vice versa, which just felt like shoehorned emotion without any real heart or connection. Instead of experiencing the stakes of aging, absence or the fate of the human species, I just wished for the plot to get somewhere.The gravity of the mission never really weighs in on the audience (excuse the puns) as the characters always find ways to subsume it with their personal concerns. The protagonist never shuts up about his family and never fails to base his mission decisions on their fate only. Okay, we get it, you care about your family. Can we move on now? The primary plan of Anne Hathaway's character turns out to be chasing THE POWER OF LOVE‚Ñ¢. A stranded scientist played by Matt Damon jeopardises the mission and attempts to murder the protagonist to find a way off the planet. This may be intentional but it's hard to hold any hope for humanity when these expeditions seem to be staffed by the least professional personnel available.Near the end, the protagonist decides that he must hurl himself and a robot into the nearest black hole and send the recorded data back to Earth. He is convinced that this will work even though they establish that nothing can escape a black hole and their craft has had no success in communicating back. If the plan succeeds, the protagonist's daughter can save humanity by using the data to reconcile General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics. Apparently Loop Quantum Gravity doesn't already do that (did the science advisor believe LQG to be less plausible than five-dimensional bulk gravity ghosts?). Besides, if one end of a wormhole is a black hole, shouldn't they have this data already?So he executes this plan and we get the non-twist that he becomes the ""ghost"" from the beginning of the film, which should surprise nobody. Well, who else would it be? The daughter herself? (which was my backup prediction). Using THE POWER OF LOVE‚Ñ¢ which transcends space and time (groan), he sends the data back to his daughter and she saves humanity. There's an epilogue with a cheap reunion but it just fills up time.Lest anyone think that I hate this film through and through, it does have its good moments. Even if the opening scenes dragged on for too long, they worked well to establish a dreary world where human civilisation is stagnating painfully rather than the usual sci-fi apocalypse which happens in an instant. The CGI sequences of the wormhole travel and tesseract were gorgeous and unique with interesting visual concepts like light distortion and higher dimensions. Unlike many others I found the soundtrack to be rousing and powerful rather than needlessly bombastic. It's a shame that none of it accompanied scenes with emotion of equal intensity.WHAT WOULD I DO?
Hypothetically, if I could change anything about Interstellar, what would it be?As I'm sure anyone can infer by now, my biggest problem with the movie is the pacing. There is not enough content to last for 169 minutes; cutting down to a typical runtime of 90-120 minutes would suffice. The beginning spent too long lingering on Earth introducing the setting and characters without setting up the premise. I would have majorly restructured the film so it immediately starts out in space (like Sunshine) and builds up the characters and backstory through regular, well-timed flashbacks (like Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours or LOST). These would cover all of the crew members, not just the protagonist, who would have their own distinct personalities, motivations, roles and backgrounds (more than just ""I miss my father"" and ""I am a family man""). This would give context to their behaviour and interactions in the ""present"". We should care more about these characters, who they are and whether they succeed.At the start of the third act, the cutaways would stop going to the past and start showing the time period when the children have grown up. Until this point the messages from Earth don't get through, so we don't get pointless teary moments until the relationships have been properly built up for the audience.The missions should be more coherent and less improvised. There is a proper briefing. Nobody is hired on-the-spot. The previous exploration through the wormhole used orbital and aerial robots like in Alien Planet. Who is trying to find what, where, and report it back to whom, before what deadline? Stick to one thing. Cut out the time-wasting scenario with Matt Damon's scientist.The general concept behind the tesseract climax is fine, though it is executed as a predictable deus ex machina. Don't bring in ghosts, gravity messages and trans-dimensional wormhole benefactors at the beginning. That sort of mystery is on-the-nose and the audience expects it to be explained eventually, negating any potential surprise. A good plot twist should be completely unexpected. I would make any climactic time travel explain events that the audience never realised needed an explanation, but make sense in hindsight.The time travelling actions should be more interesting than pushing books and sending data. Maybe the protagonist interacts directly with the future, or interacts with the past of a hitherto unrelated character, or something of the sort. Maybe the actions of the protagonist directly lead to human civilisation transcending space-time, so the tesseract construction concept doesn't just come out of nowhere. It also needs to feel justified thematically. The rest of the film had a strong emphasis on physics concepts and mentioned relativity a lot, which jars with the sudden revelation of infinite cosmic bookshelves inside a survivable black hole. Starting with the same fantasy tone would make the film consistent and make the climax more palatable.The epilogue is unnecessary. The protagonist already reunited with his daughter through all the time travel ghost stuff, which was cathartic enough. His actions have more meaning if they culminate in an ultimate sacrifice, so he should die in the black hole's singularity.Some other minor changes I would have made:Show alien landscapes that actually look alien, not just the ocean and Iceland.Cut out the Disney-esque, New Age, hippie nonsense about THE POWER OF LOVE‚Ñ¢.Stop repeating that poem so many damn times.Make the robot less annoying.FINAL VERDICT:
Pretty sights and a booming soundtrack can't make up for dull pacing, flat characters, a predictable plot and contrived cheese.4.5/10"

Christopher Nolan is the greatest director and writer of all the time."
" Interstellar
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,8,Achieving something on this scale is even an accomplishment for Nolan - especially for him to do it as well as he has. Remarkable story and exceptional VFX.
" Love is the one thing that transcends time and space
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,8,"In humans, the operation of two organs is difficult to explain simply with formulas and compounds. These two organs, one is the brain and the other is the heart. The brain leads us to rationally and objectively understand the external world and explore the laws of cosmic discovery. And the mind can lead us to feel the inexplicable yet objective world, which we call the emotional world. The external world rotates day and night, withering away and withering, and in your emotional world, only love is immortal and the seasons are everlasting."
" Amazing (at basically) Everything!
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,10,"I mean by this time we all know Christopher Nolan is one the best at what he does. This movie moved me so much, form beginning to end i felt like i was part of the story, the acting was amazing, the actors all fitted their role perfectly and you could really see how much time went into the making of this movie. The whole thing about sandstorms might be boring but it added such an amazing grizzled finish to it. You could see the regret Murph had when Cooper actually left and she was still angry at him. And all these other emotions that tied in so well with each other. The whole aspect of 'time' has always been something Christopher Nolan is interested in, he translates time into words and video which makes it so beautiful to look at if that makes any sense. The shots in this movie were just amazing, all of them but especially the ones in space and on the other planets. Perfectly enough people died throughout the movie to keep me on the edge of my seat. I really loved how Murph was also helping Professor Brand, this made the subplot on earth also interesting. I wasn't bored when they went to the subplots because they were all equally interesting to watch, there weren't to many which i hate because then at the end they don't have enough time to address and finish all the the subplots it's just an amazing perfect movie. It might be long but i feel like it should be. The storyline was interesting enough for me to watch it till the end. And wow the end... I guess i should've known that he was the 'ghost' but i didn't and i don't know why? The end made me bail my eyes out. And it's been long since that happened from a movie. The only little thing i didn't really get was WHY he needed to go to space? If i were him i would not have gone with the little information he got. He didn't know how long he was going to be gone? He didn't know if the 'Aliens' (if i can call them that) were like an actual thing. But i'm glad he did because otherwise the movie would've been real boring! Conclusion: perfect movie perfect actors perfect screenplay and perfect cinematography. Amen!"
" Interstellar is everything 2001 Space Odyssey pretended to be
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,10,"Beautifully filmed, technically magnificent, great acting, rock solid original story, scientifically accurate, and most importantly, it doesn't have a weird floating baby as an ending. Interstellar in near about perfection. Everything that Kubrick, very pretentiously wanted to achieve, Nolan made it look effortless.
On addition, McConaughey's and Chastain's performances are simply breathtaking."
" I like it
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,10,"You should be in awe of time, because it is the password of everything. But don't abuse love, because it's not the key to everything."
" love is infinite
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,8,I like the music very much. It's very powerful. The father's love for his daughter is very touching and the special effects are very good.
" Interstellar
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,9,"It's very idealistic, so it's kind of. No company dares to let anyone make such a movie. Kubrick's homage to the director's girlhood. But there are 2001 pearl jade in front of it, I think this one is at best in line with it. Nolan did what he could to make science fiction accessible. Hard core is full of human nature, warmth and dark side, making people cry."
" Sci-fi on another level & sequel talk
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,10,"There are few movies I can watch over and over again, but the breakthrough cinematography and exquisite script of Interstellar is brain food like no other. I know there's a lot of talk about why or why not there should be a sequel, but I'm for it - IF it uses theorizations for a script that entails not only Cooper and Brand, but the journey of HOW we got to the level of 5-dimensional existence (far more than a ""colonization story""). I'd absolutely love to see this and if there was a director out there who could do it, it's Nolan."
" The super movie
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,9,The super movie. The plot burns my brain. I'd like to see it many times
" A decent watch, but ridicously unrealistic
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,4,"It's a good watch. Great visual effects, good acting.Unfortunately the story is somewhat unrealistic, in many many ways. I can't believe people are saying this is the best movie they have ever seen in their lives. The protagonist travels to another galaxy through a wormhole and then after a looong 2,5 hours gets ejected from his spaceship into a black hole, where he realizes he is sort of behind his little daughter's bookcase, in a 5-dimensional world where he can just fly through the past, and he can push the books out and send encryped binary signals to a watch that he gave her when he left on that very space mission.Ok I get it, the director wants to make us think about time, how it is non-linear, but the whole thing is just totally ridiculous. Not to mention the many other flaws...like the three astronauts spend a bit of time on some newly discovered planet, they come back to the spaceship and 23 years have gone by, but their colleague and Dr. Brand's father back home don't seem like they have aged a bit. Also we then hear the protagonist's daughter (who was 10 when he left) say that she is now the age he was when he left (even though he is still more or less the same age), so wait, he was only 33 when he left even though he looked like 45 which was about the actor's age at the time of the movie? And then he comes back to some weird space station they managed to build when he's 124, and somehow his daughter is still alive? And then he spends 5 minutes with her and takes off in some spacecraft to go back through the wormhole to find Dr. Brand? what the hell is going on? the worst story ever!"
" Immy's review : Powerful, beautiful, mind numbing brilliance
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,9,"I really loved this movie. It's one of those movies that pulls you in from beginning to end, renders your emotions and thought process, makes you cry, confused, relieved, and then as it finishes leaves you completely numb as you attempt not to think about it for the rest of the day. Although this was directed to a mass audience, this actually sparks conversation and takes your brain to a cognitive state, like with many other Nolan films.
The premise is simple. Earth is on the brink of extinction due to dust bowel-like clouds wreaking havoc on the planets crops and decreasing resources. There's limited time left. Cooper, a struggling farmer and ex-pilot, along with his daughter Murph, stumble across a NASA facility where he's enlisted to board a mission to space and search for a suitable and efficient planet for the future of humanity to inhabit. Although the premise is simple, the way that it's done is phenomenally complex and beautiful.
The plot is constantly engaging due to Nolan's use of unexplained phenomenons throughout, which leaves you constantly guessing what is at play. I admit some of the concepts were heavy and hard to get your brain around, but they somehow make sense in the end, and in the way you least expect it, making for some shocking and moving revelations. The build up of the story is slow but well paced, building up to an unparalleled end that leaves you feeling somewhat sad, but content. The actors were always engaging and very talented, especially Matthew McConaughey, Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain. The effects and editing were beautiful. I thought that some scenes were so aesthetic and extremely pleasant to look at, particularly the wormhole scenes.
Nolan invites you to take a different outlook on our reality and dimensions, and to question what's really there. Time is a very prominent theme here, as the film portrays the tragic consequences of lost time on humanity and our relationships. This left a very strong uncertainty and eerie but suspenseful tone to the movie, as time is constantly chasing our main characters. I also liked the theme of betrayal, particularly in two significant characters. Although what they did was bad, the movie thankfully doesn't paint them as villains but two humans whose fear of these unforeseen circumstances and uncertainty got the best of them, painting a rather significant picture on human emotions and interactions. Although on the surface this is a Sci Fi thriller, this is only the wrapping of the emotional and heartfelt core within, which explores the pure love between humans, and how even love can break through the barriers of time and space. There are some out there who may find the 'love is quantifiable' theory cheesy, but I think there's more to it than that. Nolan invites us to look at love and human relationships as the driving force of everything. Cooper's and Murph's relationship come to symbolise this.
Overall a superb, powerful and rare epic that deserves to be more than just a sci fi movie. It's intelligence lies in the fact it puts love, family and drama within an intelligent sci-fi / thriller setting in which so many different concepts are explored and themes appear to overlap each other, making for a well balanced and beautiful film. The reason it scores 9 and not 10 is because I don't think it matches the sheer excellence and intrigue of other Nolan films like inception, but it's still a masterpiece in its own right. Highly recommend."
" Interstellar
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,9,"On the one hand, space adventure, on the other hand, is a popular emotional drama. No matter how hard science fiction looks: wormholes, black holes, space adventures, multidimensional space The core is still family and love. In fact, science and theory serve for emotion, and wrap the softest emotion in a very hard shell. Because of this, it will not be as serious and great as 2001 science fiction, but it has a fuller feeling."
" Blown away every time I watch
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,10,"6 years later and this film still fills me with so much. I've rated 100s of films on IMDb and only ever have given a handful of 10 stars. I'm not one for tears but interstellar has me every time. This is the most visually stunning film I have seen, even to date. Without a doubt Nolan's (for me). I couldn't recommend this film enough. Strap in and enjoy it. They don't make many like this. 10/10"
" This movie is mainly about the threat that human beings will not survive in the near future with the deterioration of the earth's natural environment.
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,8,"This movie is mainly about the threat that human beings will not survive in the near future with the deterioration of the earth's natural environment. At this time, scientists found a wormhole near Saturn in the solar system, through which they could break the limitation of human ability and search for the chance to continue life in further outer space. An expedition team crossed the solar system through the wormhole. Their goal is to find a planet suitable for human migration. On this ship called ""Endurance"", the explorers are facing unprecedented challenges that human thought has never met. This ..This movie shows us that in the future life, science and technology are closely related to our life. In the boundless universe, there are still endless unknowns and mysteries waiting for us to explore and discover. For example, what kind of five-dimensional space, wormholes and so on, all of which are mysterious beings in the universe.
However, advanced technology is still needed to explore the basis of all this. With the rapid development of modern science and technology, we have already walked out of the era before and entered the era of advanced science and technology. The development of science and technology has brought great convenience to our life. We cannot do without science and technology. Science and technology are all around us. Any series of changes around us originate from science and technology. The benefits it brings us cannot be ignored, thanks to science and technology! It is the great power of science and technology that has changed our world and made our life better.
However, science and technology is also a double-edged sword. With the development of science and technology, we have indeed enjoyed many benefits of science and technology. However, the environment is deteriorating day by day and will eventually threaten our survival. Therefore, it is even more necessary for us to be cautious and handle it carefully. While developing science and technology, we should not neglect the nature on which human beings depend for survival, and let the environment and science and technology develop together!
Let's face up to the power of science and technology, cultivate a heart that loves science, nature and science from an early age, contribute to the development of science and technology, and make our life better!"
" Christopher Nolan is at his A Game with this one.
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,10,"This may be his best, maybe Inception but I still think this might be it. I love it and I could watch it for days."
" Awesomness overloaded
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie took me to a journey I hv never thought off and I won't forget this in near future.
A master piece from the director and a exceptional performance by the actor Matthew McConaughey & Anne Hathaway.Should hv watched on a bigger screen nonetheless a delight to watch."
" Prolonged*
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,6,This movie was too much science and I think is for ners! Got me involved and lost my focus after a while!
" Dull, boring, predictable and OVERRATED
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,1,"I believe this is probably one of the most overrated movies ever. A ""2001"" wannabe, full of boring clich√©s and nonsense sci-fi. Probably the definition of the expression: over-promise, under-deliver."
" wonderful
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,10,"I want to give 100 stars. This is probably the most shocking movie I have ever seen. At the end of the movie, there were tears. The miracle was not because of God or some kind of unknown power. It is ourselves. Humans do not believe in human power. Those unpredictable miracles are regarded as the merits of God. Ruolan has shown my world view so shockingly, I feel I am so excited now"
" Just speechless
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,10,I just want to say that this is the best movie I have ever seen
" A waste of a beautiful Hans Zimmer soundtrack
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,1,"The beautiful music by Zimmer is literally the only enjoyable thing about this film and it's such shame that this soundtrack couldn't have been used for a truly good space film instead.The first time I saw Interstellar was at the movie theater and I actually fell asleep. Tried to watch it another time on Netflix and couldn't get farther than 1 hour in before becoming bored out of my skull. Can I just say that I love me a good space themed movie. ""Moon"", ""Sunshine"", ""Passengers"", ""The Martian"". Hell, I can even get through Kubrik's ""2001: Space Odussey""! But Interstellar will definitely not be part of that list.Now after a close friend mentioned this as being one of their favorite films of all time, I literally FORCED myself to watch through it again and man... what a waste of time. (don't tell my friend that!)Here are my problems with Interstellar:
1) Starting with the acting. Either the actors suck, the direction sucks or the script sucks. Probably a little bit of each. The things these characters say and the way they behave just doesn't feel natural or realistic. So much corny dialogue! The characters do absolutely NOTHING to compel me or make feel anything any sense of attachment for them. Even the little girl character which was meant to tug at your heart strings does nothing for me. Don't even get me started on the robots. To be fair, the fact that I find Matthew McConaughey highly annoying, doesn't help. Come to think of it, what would have helped is if his and Matt Damon's roles would have been reversed. Matt Damon makes for a much more approachable and lovable figure, where as McConaughey has always been much more suited to be kind of a selfish bad guy.2) So many illogical points in the film that leave you wondering: WHY? I have a tolerance for a certain amount of holes in a film, but this just has too many to bear.3) When you want to watch a space themed movie, you're expecting to see some amazing visuals that transport you to another time and place. But even in this department, Interstellar doesn't really deliver. There are a few cool snippets, but for the most part, the movie leans very much on the dialogue between characters.If you enjoyed the films I mentioned before, you will most likely be just as disappointed as I was by Interstellar."
" Great movie
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,8,"The front is the agricultural age after the extinction of knowledge and science in the end of industry, and the back is the magnificent and shocking wormhole, black hole, the fifth dimension, deep is the sincere feeling through time and space. The film excellently shows the human nature affection based on the theory foundation."
" Mind Blown
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,10,"Like I said, Mind Blown. I cannot express how mindblown i am right now, but If I could show it or express it, my mind would be blown away lolol"
" Interstellar: Science that won hearts.
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar, the brainchild of the Nolan brothers is nothing short of a cosmic revelation. McConaughey's Cooper and Hathaway's Amelia Brand join a team of astronauts to lead an expedition into space to battle extinction on Earth. Their mission is to find a habitable planet in another galaxy to which mankind can escape to, from our apocalypse-approaching Earth. The almost three-hours long adventure that follows is full of strange new worlds, a lot of techno-talk, and a fair bit of philosophical debates.Interstellar is an astounding prototype of superior science fiction films, the kind which refuses to let you look away from the screen even when space suit-clad scientists discuss theoretical physics. On their mission to find a habitable, cognizable planet, the Cooper, Amelia, and the rest of the astronauts on the mission are removed from everything that defines them as humans. They have had to leave their families, their homes, and their jobs back on Earth to take on the Herculean responsibility of saving mankind from perishing on the soon-to-be-inhabitable Earth. Apart from this planned objective, they have no idea what lies their way. From entering a wormhole to setting foot on an ocean-planet to falling inside a black hole, they face all kinds of complex and scientific obstacles.Hans Zimmer's background score helps in relaying the underlying thrill to the audience and lends a somewhat hypnotic effect to the film. Interstellar has just the right blend of science and fiction which makes it an enjoyable watch along with being thought-provoking and scientifically viable. Even after you have walked out of the theater, one thing you can be sure of is that this film will stay with you long after it has ended."
" masterpiece
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,9,It is a work of god suitable for painting once a year. It's probably the greatest sci-fi movie of the 21st century in my opinion. Under the shell of science fiction is a warm heart. I regret not seeing the film in the cinema.
" It is definately a better sci fi movie.
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,9,One of the Christopher Nolan's masterpiece. This movie dealt into a lot hypothetical theories about time travel and black hole. The direction of the movie is very crisp. The actors justify the vision of the director and looks convincing in the role. The cinematography is brilliant. A special thanks to the VFX team for blending great looking special effects.
" This is the best movie of all time
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,10,Perfect cast for a perfect storyline. Heart racing from start to finish. Trying to hold back tears every 10 minutes. This movie takes you on a journey like nothing else out there. It left me thinking about the future of our planet and the similar scenarios we could be up against. The relationship between Cooper & Murph is something special to watch. Please watch this movie if you're thinking about it!!!!
" The most incredible movie ever made!!
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,10,I love this movie!! I have never watched a more engaging movie than interstellar. Even when I talk about this movie it gives me goosebumps and makes me want to watch again which I am doing right now! Every character in this movie fits perfectly and the scene when he comes back and his daughter is old is one of the most moving moments I have experienced in a movie. It is mind bending thinking about this movie and makes me fall in love with it even more. Best movie ever made and I have seen just about all of them.
" A review for interstellar? Nah bruh, I ain't God to post a review
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,10,"Human beings bound to 3 dimensional space shouldn't be allowed to post a review for this movie! This movie,THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE, THE MOVIE OF THE CENTURY, is meant for human beings who have evolved past the 3 dimensions of our world! And hence, I reserve my comments for this absolute masterpiece of a film!"
" Memorable and Remarkable
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,8,"When I remember where, when, how, and who I watched a movie with......you know it's special.Interstellar fits that category.It was similar to inception but I was able to follow it a little more in depth.One of my favorite scenes was when Cooper (NASA pilot) uses the signal of pushing the books in an alternate universe he is in to signify he is still alive to his daughter. And if that made no sense, please watch the movie.It is astounding, fascinating, and mental chess are good words to use for a movie description here."
" The Best Movie Ever Made

Christopher Nolan has made some amazing films, this and the prestige are prob up there with my best 2 films of all time. Watching this film makes my heart ache, not many films do this, his daughter in the film as a child Mackenzie foy, what a great actress so believable. As a dad of 2 girls it breaks my heart seeing the scenes between dad and daughter. Just a amazing film love it to bits."
" A story beyond space and time
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,8,"This is one of the best films I have ever seen. As a science student myself, I envy the attention to many scientific facts in this movie being true. A story of a bond in between a father and her daughter is told in the most beautiful way possible.
However, I can see many people saying that Christopher Nolan as always directed this movie in a very generic way, like all his other movies. I will have to agree to this, their is nothing very special about the camerawork and so on. Hans Zimmer's score is mesmerizing as always however it feels a little less special.
This movie is a must watch if you like watching films!"
" Worth it
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,9,"Totally worth watching it! A movie that is a must to watch. It is quite touching when it comes to the end of it, however I'd highly recommend for others to watch this movie."
" Every time it blows up my mind

Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night.Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.And you, my father, there on that sad height,

",2020-05-05 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie is 2014 but I keep getting back to it, it's so magnificent. Everything is perfect, from writing to the CGI, and boy don't get me started on the soundtrack, Interstellar has the best soundtrack I've heard in any movie! It's just so great! Hans Zimmer and Nolan has put in a great show with the soundtrack and its both heart warming and wrenching at the same time.
This movie takes you on an emotional ride and also a slight indication that humans are not ready to bear time dilation. Doyle's death was super avoidable though. The greatest movie of all time."
" Nolan's greatest work... ever!
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,10,"This films was ignored by all academies, a true inspiration, a beautiful movie. An incredible story, incredible visual effects, a score that was unbelievable and possibly one of the greatest of all time. If you want to be blown away at the end with Hans Zimmer's booming score then this is the one; a true spectacle of cinema. If you were lucky enough to have seen this in IMAX theatres then well done. Nevertheless even if you are at home with your TV the picture will be incredible, crystal clear as you see the Black Hole emerge in the horizon. This is my favourite movie and nothing can come close to beating it, just utter perfection. The physics is accurate the characters motivations are willing and believable. You will love it even if you don't like science fiction there are aspects that appeal to everyone, a truly incredible movie that will become your favourite movie for some time. Nolan promises an incredible space adventure that keeps you thinking, crying and most possibly in awe."

",2020-05-01 00:00:00,10,"I saw this film a few years ago. All I can say is that it is stunning. Most space movies are very dull and boring. This one is mysterious, acting is stellar, script is engaging, the soundtrack is beautiful, the special effects are spot on. All I can say is that this film is a masterpiece and I only give masterpieces a 10 out of 10. Best space film ever made and one of the best films ever in my opinion. It's just beautiful. Absolutely amazing."
" my favourite film :)
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,10,"I've watched it I think 7 or 8 times and every time is amazing. This film is perfection (like every Nolan's film) from soundtrack to characters but also the script, photography and direction. It is not only a science fiction masterpiece but it is also extremly drama. Matthew's tears are very deep and you can feel the emotions of every chararcter of the film. So, in my opionion is the greatest film I've ever seen. Thanks Nolan :)"
" Waste of time
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,1,Matthew McConnaughey's Southern accent is unbearable. The story not very exciting. The whole thing a blend of boring and annoying. Quite an achievement.
" Are you a Space freak? Then just go for it
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,8,"Overall Interstellar is a mind-blowing movie with fantastic visual's, interesting story line and the movie will keep you interested till the end even though it may seem that the movie is a bit slow paced. The story is about a team of explorers undertakes the most important mission in human history; traveling beyond this galaxy travelling through a worm hole to discover whether mankind has a future among the stars where frequent dust storms seem to threaten the very existence of mankind. You need to be patient with this movie to understand the concepts of relativity and bending time to tie all the loose ends eventually.
Wanna travel into the space, feel the time manipulation with heart touching emotions, then you cannt miss this movie."
" amazing
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,10,"It really good, idk why people are giving such a low rating, its so good. it might be a little fiction but thats all rigjt"
" My favourite movie
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,10,This movie is beautiful and it truly contains the story to be the greatest film ever made. I am going to watch it again.
" Tears filled my eyes
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,8,"You should fear time, for it is the key to everything; But do not abuse love, for it is not the key to everything.
The director does his best to make accessible science fiction, hard core and full of humanity, warmth and dark side, which makes people cry."
" Masterpiece.
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,10,"If you love space theme, you dream about journey through universe, this film is for you. Firstly, the plot is mind-blowing, actually I don't expect anything lese because the director of film if genius Christopher Nolan. One of the favourite aspect in his film is time issue. This film solve the time problem from another side if it is compared with Inception. The drama and tradegy are also perfectly shown. Secondly, the cast is brilliant, I don't want to highlight someone because all actors and actresses shown the great performance despite of main character or supporting role. Thirdly, visual effects are wonderful, I don't recommend watch this film on little screen. I had feeling that I was on that spaceship when I watched the film.
So, it's one of genius work from great master of cinema."
" Interstellar: A compete experience.
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,10,"What was I thinking after seeing Interstellar? It is extremely hard to describe it because I could not organize my mind due to the rain of circumstances in which the movie soaks you.
First, the movie involves you with the familiar and the extreme situation that the characters are living in the Eart. Also, it is a very emotional presentation of courage, fear, and drastic desitions that must be made.
Later, the beauty of the whole odyssey across the vastness of space and, the experience that the magnificent graphics give you is brutal if you added it to the huge scientific approximation with the physical laws. In the same way, the use of relativity and its paradox will make explode your head.
In conclusion, Interstellar is not a conventional movie; it is a movie that drives you beyond the inner world of the human mind and their heart, showing us how the feelings can conditionate our actions. In addition to the exceptional plot, the soundtrack completes the entire experience of the viewer, providing you a marvelous and complete story for all your senses."
" It changed my view of life
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,"That movie really changed my view of life. To look up to the stars, is what I missed in life and since than, I'm back on my mission.
Great movie, awesome actcting, a movie that inspires."
" 50% sci-fi, 60% soap drama.
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,3,"McConaughey and Hathaway are terrible in leading roles, neither one doesn't remotely remind of an astronaut. McConaughey is more of a cowboy than science guy and Hathaway is all emotions and no sanity and almost gets herself killed on the first planet for acting like an idiot.Sci-fi parts are very nice looking adventuring, except the beginning bit with the wormhole which is way too fictional compared to the general feel of the movie. Sadly, most of the film is a soap-drama and it makes the movie unnecessarily long-winded and annoying."
" one of the best movies I have ever seen
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,"Where to begin. There's no movie like it and despite the possible scientific inaccuracies and plot holes, the movie shines for many other reasons. The visual effects and the CGI which aren't abused of as they share the spotlight with outstanding practical effects based on models and real-life robots; it's spectacularly jaw-dropping. The execution of the story, the overall ideas and concepts and the final conclusion drives the audience to a mind-blowing perplexion and awe.To see the portrayal of space travelling in such a realistic approach showcasing a how and what it would look like if we had the tools and means to do it is breath-taking and trully inspiring. The movie wanders into realms yet unknown to mankind today so it pulls from fiction and creative imagery to portray things but always stretching the scientific and theoretical basis as long as it can before deciding to make it up. If only the negative critics of this movie would take a closer look at how Christopher Nolan directs his movies they'd see the amount of research and scientists he works with to try to capture whatever he's working on as realistically as possible. He did it for this movie and he also did it for Inception and probably many other of his movies.But the ""interstellar"" space travelling is just a vessel for the real story the movie holds. A story about humanity and the tough decisions we will have to face when and if we face the brink of extinction and the planet can no longer host us as we keep mistreating it. This planet's resources are finite and with anything finite in quantity they're bound to run out eventually. And when that time comes, we will all hope to have the emotional and mindful strength the Coopers and the Brands had in this movie, to look at the others and realise if the fate of humanity lies in our hands, can we really do what's necessary and to do what's right?The movie launches into deep heartwrenching questions and scenarios where we are witness of the best and worse of humanity. And these are only intensified by the tense and scary space travelling slave of time and resources to make the trip possible.As for the story, I'm not yet a father and yet I feel the painful goodbyes and every stressful moment as time passes by and the answers of the movie are not yet found. The performances of everyone are real and evoque authentic reactions to many of the scenarios the characters are put through. You really do end up loving the characters you are meant to but you never really hate the ones you should because their motivations are well developed and understandable. This is really a human story, it isn't space cowboys or Star Wars with heroes meant to save the universe or the planet, these are people willing to risk everything to do it, no superpowers, lightsabers or laser guns.Ever since I first saw the movie I felt a deep connection with it. The movie makes you think, it makes you reflect on us and of what place we occupy in the universe. It makes you stare at the sky, at the stars and wonder what the universe holds beyond what we know. Are there others like us, are there other planets we could some day visit? How far can and will humanity's pioneering potential reach? These questions find a possible answer in the movie without using conventional and well-known ideas and concepts.Another worthy highlight of the movie: the soundtrack. The composer Hans Zimmer is known to be the mastermind behind scores like the Lion King, Pirates of the Caribbean, Inception, the Last Samurai, Gladiator ,etc. Today he's one of the most astounding composers in cinema and proof of that is the score of this movie. Tense and teeth clenching when necessary as well as inspiring and uplifting when the situation requires it. It's unique and holds secrets within I highly recommend you research when you have the time.IN CONCLUSION, the movie is a parade of fantastic special effects, music, tense and light situations, contemplative thinking and reasoning, an endearing but heart-wrenching story about humanity and the prospects of facing extinction and what choices and decisions can and should be made. The movie has more bullets in its magazines so unfortunately (or not, depending how you look at it) it requires more than one viewing to fully understand every detail in the plot and also visual cues for you to understand better the ""science"" behind it.Finally, it's true that when you first watch the movie you might end up confused or asking questions. And for those who have never watched a Christopher Nolan movie, this is common with his movies. They are meant to make you think and question what you saw, it's not for the light block-bustery seeking audiences who expected yet another Star Wars. If you take the time to look at what it's trying to say you will be treated with an incredibly well-developed story that may lack in craftmanship or other plot mistakes, but it makes up in a powerful story with well performed characters and an emotional journey. And for the engineers and other scientists like me, you'll probably want to fix the world and build a rocket after watching this movie. It's uplifting and inspiring for those who studied and dream to create and improve society by the use of technology, math and science. And remember ""do not go gentle into that good night""."
" interesting movie
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,"I see this movie again almost 4 or 5 years old I think, first I saw it in the cinema, from the beginning it seemed like a super cool movie, and magical. I love this type of movies that mix fiction with alternate realities that can happen in the real world.
on the other hand, the story of the film about a father who travels to space for a few months, and when his daughter and this old woman return, this because in space time varies and is worth less time. the whole movie is very moving I liked it a lot and also see it again."
" It's an endless abyss, and it's also the place of dim light
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,9,"Wandering in space, the ""black hole"" that makes all scientists avoid is like a metaphor of real human nature: people are often not so good beyond what they see on the surface, but they are not as bad as they think. Everyone has seven passions and six desires, as well as selfishness. Therefore, all good and bad are not so simple. The difference is, which is more critical?
Dr. mace, who is alone on the unmanned planet, is waiting for rescue with a glimmer of hope. The long loneliness makes him more eager to see his own kind again. The so-called: stay dead and be young. When death is near, fear gives birth to an unprecedented force, which may be a strong belief to live no matter what. However, the complexity of human nature is also here. There must be boundless darkness hidden in the positive. When too strong desire for survival becomes the ultimate goal of life, good human nature will be squeezed to almost invisible.
When the original ""be good for others"" becomes ""be good for yourself"" generous giving becomes cruel plunder! Compared with animals fighting for survival, human beings have to rationalize their inhumanity.
Since there are people like Max, there will be people like Cooper who are willing to sacrifice themselves. This may be the way to balance the world. When Cooper faces the black hole, the expected impact is also shocking! The fragments that can't be dodged are like innumerable fears inside. When fear is useless, you can only go through them and wait for the results.
A black hole that no one has ever dared to cross is not necessarily an endless abyss, but also the place of dim light. So death is also called ""past life"". People are very fragile, said no; but people are also very strong, desperate valley will open a stubborn flower of hope."
" An almost perfect viewing experience.
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,9,"An almost perfect viewing experience. Using the theories of interstellar travel, the visual wonders created from these theories are stunning. The structure is still Nolan's usual parallel montage acceleration, and the final reversal is a loop.Very traditional Hollywood genre writing, but the use of detail and foibles is absolutely textbook, and the core of the story is always love, making people cry."
" One of the best films of all time
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,"The story from start to finish is really thought provoking. After I finished watching it was all I could think about. I think Nolan really took a risk toying with complex science in this film but it really payed off giving us a a spectacle like no other, which went hand in hand with the music throughout. this film shows the ugly side of humanity and the beautiful side in more ways than one. it's a must see!"
" Best movie ever!
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,10,"This is the second time I've looked this movie. If I can give 11, I would give it easily. It is very interesting pointing to time, how we understand it. I recommend it to everyone!"
" Mind Blowing!
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,10,"The movie is mind blowing. I have never seen a movie with so much scientific explanation which makes sense. It can't be fully called science fiction as some of the scientific theories given behind this movie are correct. After the earth gets near to its end, a group of astronauts starts their journey for finding a new planet. The direction is a masterpiece. It can't be described in words. Anyone interested in space and time travel will love this movie as the whole movie revolves around the interstellar space and planets. The movie was entertaining throughout and has never bored me for a second. It is a must watch for everyone."
" a brief evaluation
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,9,"The film's powerful cast lays a solid foundation for a cold space journey. Matthew McConaughey, the oscar-winning actor who won his statuette at the beginning of 2014, has done a good job of playing the role of a father who is caught in a dilemma and put family first. Anne hathaway's dialogue is persuasive in both serious science and the softer parts of her heart; ""Model worker"" Jessica chastain doesn't get much screen time, but as part of her emotional arc, she's pretty good, too."
" Overall unconvincing
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,3,"Nothing in this film was believable to me. It felt like a parody.In a world where people think Apollo 11 was fake, a guy randomly flies to another galaxy and walks other planets like it's no big deal, after zero training and literally five minutes after having discovered he would do that, leaving his two underage kids behind.Suddenly, they mix space travel with time travel that modifies the past. Because, obviously, this is realistic.I don't even know how to put in words how much the ""a few minutes here means 23 years back on Earth"" was ridiculous.The overall unconvincing and unbelievable feeling is enhanced by the surprisingly very poor CGI / 3D.Also, the main character's actor doesn't know to articulate and it's deeply annoying.The only two positive things I have to say: there were two or three really gripping moments, and the music is an incredible masterpiece.But overall, yes, this film felt so deeply uncovincing. Nothing felt real."
" ""Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.""
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,10,"As far as a masterful visualization of space and an exploration of profound theory, it belongs on a shortlist of must see films which it's comparably akin to. It's as grand as it is introspective and as grounded as it is existential. By the end of the nearly three-hour running time - it goes by in a flash - you feel as if you've experienced something that is so rarely captured on film. The movie waxes poetic about the universality of love and lingers beautifully on worlds beyond ours."
" Mind Blowing

" The Warmhole Goes Ever On
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,9,"Let's start with what Christopher Nolan got right in Interstellar, which is a lot. After spending eight or so years making successful, culture-defining Batman movies , he chose to spend his clout making a science-fiction epic in the mold of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Like Stanley Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke's masterpiece, Nolan's Interstellar is ""hard"" sci-fi, meaning it relies on known science for its settings and plot points. Until it doesn't.The first known science it throws at us is a near future earth ravaged by climate change and the resource wars we are already seeing break out in places like Central Africa and the Levant. Overpopulation is no longer as big a problem as it is today, because six billion people have died, including Cooper's (Matthew McConaughey) wife. But crops are failing, species are dying, and corn, our last remaining foodstuff, is threatened by a dust borne blight. Cooper, a former star astronaut and aerospace engineer, is now using his talents to build robotic harvesters to keep feeding the starving masses. But then, he receives a strange signal: a location encoded in binary somehow sent through gravity waves to his daughter Murph's (Mackenzie Foy) bedroom. The location turns out to be a secret NASA base where the world's remaining space scientists, led by Professor Brand (Michael Caine) are preparing an expedition into a wormhole that unknown alien intelligence has opened near Saturn. Twelve expeditions have gone into the wormhole looking for a planet where humans can relocate to save the species when earth is no longer habitable, which will be within a generation. Three have reported back encouraging results, and Cooper, along with Professor Brand's daughter (Anne Hathaway), is tasked with diving into the wormhole and finding out which exoplanet is just right for us.Shot on 70mm film with a pleasing mix of old-fashioned practical effects and digital wizardry, Interstellar is at its best when McConaughey is surfing his spaceship down a water planet's Everest-sized waves or skirting the event horizon of a black hole called Gargantua that is the most spectacular and accurate image of the astronomical phenomenon ever created. If you're going to see Interstellar - and if you're any kind of sci-fi fan you absolutely should - see it on as big a screen as possible to appreciate Nolan's impeccable craftsmanship.But it's too bad the craftsmanship didn't extend to the script. Nolan's Batman movies were generally worthy, but they had one too many subplots, an over reliance on coincidence, and characters acting like archetypes instead of human beings. Outside the superhero space, these flaws become glaring. Seemingly afraid of losing some mythical demographic of viewers who came to a space opera to see a father-daughter relationship drama, Nolan can't go five minutes without repeating that it's hard to leave your kids behind when you're on a multi-year deep-space mission to save humanity. Then the (admittedly eye-popping) love-conquers-all ending undermines all that came before.It boils down to this: Interstellar is 120 minutes of good movie stuffed into 170 minutes."
" Love transcends all borders!
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,8,"Very good movie by Christopher Nolan! Scientists go through a wormhole in space to find habitable planets as the Earth is coming to an end. But it is not only that it is a love story between a father and his daughter of sacrifice, hope and how all that does to the human being for more than this millions of light years in another galaxy and strive not to lose that. The staging that Nolan does as his direction are magnificent envelopes making us feel in space with these characters, great visual effects, some without the use of computer effects but which are excellent and scientifically quite accurate, a must-see film of science fiction."
" Waste of time.
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,1,This film is great if you were in a coma and it was the only thing u could do
" OVERRATED
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,6,"If I would rank only the way that film looks, I would give it a 10/10 but I am not. CHRIST, NEWSFLASH KIDS THERE IS NOTHING ORIGINAL ABOUT THIS MOVIE. It is called Theory of relativity. Nolan proved once again that he is a great director. Unfortunately the script was very poorly written. When you make a movie based on physics YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT HOW LOVE TRANSCENDS DIMENSION. It was cliched, the dialog was cheesy and the monologues about love were embarrassing. It was inspired by 2001 a space odyssey, and Nolan added physics laws, which would have been cool, but he tried to make it to emotional too.
The result is a cliched, visually stunning and overrated movie."
" You should be in awe of time, because that is the code of everything; but do not abuse love, because that is not the key to everything.

" good
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,8,"My view of Nolan and his film is that it's a good movie, but no matter what you think, you can't deny that interstellar is a hellish journey. He is undoubtedly one of the best filmmakers of our time, and of all times. I can't wait to see what he does next, but I'm not sure if his emotions will be as strong as interstellar's."
" Films don't get any better than this
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,10,"A love story. Love for family, earth and the human race. Hans Zimmer's score is perfect. Sometimes less is more. Thank you to the Nolan brothers."
" Still my No. 1 movie
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,10,"When I watched this movie years ago, I got obsessed with it, even six years later I continue to watch the movie repeatedly. The story is unique. Yes, it is about space like many movies, but not a single movie about space can even come near to Interstellar. Your whole body is immersed in the plot, you are on the same emotional level as the actors, Matthew McConaughey and Jessica Chastain but also Christopher Nolan who did a phenomenal job. My heart was pounding in those exciting scenes. I can't even describe how perfect this movie is. It is my all-time favorite and I can just recommend it to everyone."
" When Cinema Turns Into a Mixture Of Creativity Lessons
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,10,"Directed by the great Christopher Nolan , Interstellar obviously is one of The best and most enjoyable viewing experiences in my life . The movie gave us the best role ever of Matthew McConaughey With greats performances of Anne Hathaway , Jessica Chastain And Michael Caine . The way of photography was simply a masterpiece, and the selected photography sites were perfect, and I don't think it is possible to find a better one . Music was a fantasy by the genius Hans Florian Zimmer and of course it has a big role in the attachment with the movie with the movie . Once you enter watching the movie, it starts taking you to dimensions you never expect and makes you feel part of it. As for the end of the movie, it will make you realize values and lessons that will remain in your mind forever.. When the movie ends, you will realize that it is very difficult and even unlikely to see a movie of the same level as interceller . To everyone who has not seen this masterpiece, I highly recommend you to watch it, you will enjoy it. A big greeting to everyone who contributed to this project.
Peace."
" Missed Opportunity
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,4,"Why, oh why, did they pick the mumbling, bumbling, whispering, incomprehensible Mathew McConaughey for this part? Did't they have a speech coach, sound engineer or SOMEONE that could turn his ridiculous inaudible mumblings into actual understandable English?Thank God the music was great, the story was great and CGI was great.Maybe one day - in 20 years or so - someone will remake this with a lead actor who doesn't try to talk with a ridiculous unintelligible accent.Or re-issue this one with subtitles.Such a shame."

",2020-04-18 00:00:00,7,"With the earth on the brink of dying a group of explorers head to a wormhole in space where they believe there is a new home for the human race.
The cast is first rate and therefore the touching moments and action are done with a first class touch. The only minus for me and it might be my limited understanding in science is there where parts I just didn't get.
But overall a very good blockbuster."

" best movie ever

" Benchmark for sci-fi movies!
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,10,"A visually stimulating blockbuster will leave you pondering about the vast and mysterious expanse of space. The use of Hans Zimmer's musical genius adds to the high-risk high reward action prevalent across the entire film that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The insightful opinion on the mechanics of space-time and gravity (backed by the mental genius of Nobel Prize-winning astrophysicist Kip Thorne) is fascinating and mind-bending. For those uninterested in the phenomena of space, the beautiful storytelling at the base of this movie, such as the father-daughter relationship, or the feeling of ultimate betrayal will leave viewers leaving the theater exhilarated as disembark from the emotional rollercoaster this movie is. 10/10 for me and a job well done for all those involved in the making of this movie (and of course special thanks to Christopher Nolan's enthralling storytelling)."
" Stunning
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,10,"This film captivated me in a way like no other. Nolan has a way to twist and tie the story together and this film is a perfect example of his talent. Not only is it beautifully put together, but the thin line between reality and the seemingly unrealistic is melted together to make you believe that this all could happen in our universe. The swirl of emotions I felt is absolved by the end, yet still tears peaking out of my eyes. This will forever be my favorite science fiction film."

" Pretentious and mediocre
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,4,"Interstellar is not a bad film but neither is it the great one suggested by some reviewers.The basic premise is reasonable although the early coincidences are somewhat farfetched. Nonetheless, the story makes a degree of sense for the first hour, even if it becomes a bit confused at times, but then descends into mostly confusion and ultimately implausibility and even incomprehensibility. It really falls down is in the mumbled dialogue and loud and dreadful 'musical' accompaniment that frequently renders the mumbling almost completely inaudible, even if it could be understood. Whoever is it that thinks loud noise enhances dramatic action, particularly when it drowns whatever dialogue there is ?McConaughey and Hathaway do almost nothing but mumble and the only bright spot is the far better elocution of other cast members, especially Michael Caine until, that is, he's on his death bed and his words fade into incomprehensibility too.This is a film of grand designs but poor execution. It could easily have been a true gem but, in the end, is just another pretentious and mediocre film made by a director far too enamoured of the assorted technological gimmicks available to him. The phrase ""Less is More"" springs to mind and that is certainly the case here.I give it a mark of 4 because it's a decent idea that could have real traction. On the basis of the film itself and it's pretty limited script, plus the lack of audibility, I'd be stretched to give it 1.Almost forgot. What more obvious ending could there have been to point to a potential sequel ? What a dreary, boring yet almost inevitable thought."

",2020-04-10 00:00:00,10,"It's truly captivating. The way the world turns and time bends itself into a distant, yet intrinsically real reality of what life can create. Time loops into a vortex of unknown parallels in the universe. What seems uncanny and simply twisted, magnifies the very existence of all life formed in every possible way. A vortex porthole into another dimension, pulling through our undestroyable energy to another realm. We are far and close in what our souls can see in fractals of continuing existence. To be where we are, yet so far, a part in distant awakenings of time and pursued realities. An incredible film of true imagination of another source of life in its simplest and most heroic forms. Matthew McConaughey, portraying a man of drive and pure purpose to save all possible life on Earth and his daughter of utmost importance to the next stage of life. Michael Caine, shining his intelligence to complete the puzzle, as Anne Hathaway's pursuit of acknowledging that ""Love is the one this that we are capable of perceiving that transcends through space and time."" A true force of the soul we are yet to understand completely. Murphy's Law, anything that can happen, will happen. Every possible life, every possible entity and every possible creation to be created. Weather it be here on Earth or in another place in the universe.
What is time? Process of Creation.
What is life? Purpose to Create.

" ""Once you're a parent, you're the ghost of your children's future.""
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,9,"Ambitious, loud and sublime, almost to a fault, the 2014 sci-fi epic from blockbuster auteur Christopher Nolan fascinates, and drains, on an emotionally charged three hour odyssey that's sure to leave audiences overwhelmed, just as the writer-director intended. Boldly going where few filmmakers have gone before, Nolan, alongside his longtime writing partner and brother Jonathan, proves he's at his best when interweaving breathtaking landscapes, heart-pumping set pieces and stunning cinematography with affecting character moments, poetic storytelling and poignant themes. Receiving a mixed response from critics when first released, much criticism was thrown at the film's lofty runtime, melodramatic sequences and clunky dialogue, yet these fail to tarnish an otherwise captivating and thought-provoking experience. Soon to be seen in the same pantheon of sci-fi classics from Stanley Kubrick and Ridley Scott, Earth's finest all turn in fantastic work, such as a superb leading man performance by Matthew McConaughey, strong supporting efforts from Anne Hathaway and Michael Caine, and the career-best Hans Zimmer score that slingshots this picture into another dimension.9/10 cold cryostasis cameos."
" A Beautiful and Thought-Provoking Spectacle
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,10,"""After you kids came along, your mom, she said something to me I never quite understood. She said, 'Now, we're just here to be memories for our kids.' I think now I understand what she meant.""Before I begin, I have to say how special this movie is to me. Back in 2014, when I first saw this, I had never seen anything like it. Flash forward five years - I'm now somewhat obsessed with film and film history, and that still has not changed. I had never before been completely captivated by a movie from start to finish. It was an emotional and immersive experience that I've never forgotten. But most importantly, this film was a wonder; it was as if it contained all the mystery of the universe within it.What do I mean by that exactly? Interstellar does not solve any universal mysteries, and at times does not even make scientific sense. But Interstellar captures perfectly the feeling of the child inside of everyone that looks up and wonders, ""what's out there?"" We see outer space in spectacular glory, but we are only able to scrape the surface of what these marvels really are. We see the way time works, but do we fully understand it? We see the most accurate depiction of a black hole ever created, but it still remains shrouded in mystery. The characters must deal with phenomena that we have attempted to comprehend, but possibly never will. It's one of the only movies where the phrase ""anything can happen"" truly applies. And this glimpse into a tiny fraction of the possibilities of our universe is one of the most awe-inspiring and thought-provoking pieces of science fiction filmmaking I've ever seen.This film certainly goes for spectacle in many instances, with worlds and spatial phenomena brought to life by some of the most beautiful special effects ever put to screen. Not to mention the incredible haunting score from Hans Zimmer. But at its heart, this is the story of a father who needs to keep his promise to his daughter. ""I love you forever. And I'm coming back. I'm coming back."" It is a human story that also happens to transcend space and time. The question of ""Will Cooper be able to save the world?"" is secondary to ""Will Cooper keep his promise?"" This human element is what differentiates this film from something like 2001: A Space Odyssey. It is the story of Cooper and Murph. Every movie has an essential question, and this one's is ""Will they ever see each other again?"" And somehow, I've never been more desperate to learn the answer.The greatest film Christopher Nolan has made and will ever make."

" Great
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,7,"This story is a true story of father and daughter through time and space. Although the theme of ""love through time and space"" has been ruined by countless romantic fantasy online novels, this film can make people cry, because it is so pure and true, and our lives are so similar. Cooper did not embrace ""my journey is the stars and the sea"" lingyun ambition, just want to finish the task as soon as possible back to her daughter to accompany her growth. In the fall of the human crisis, Murphy's ultimate haven is still the place where he and his father have the most memories."
" In my mind, science fiction is the first.
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,8,"The core of this film is a family drama, a story about love and commitment between father and daughter.The film allows the most real and warm feelings and waiting of human beings to naturally infiltrate into the grand and solemn human epic of space immigrants.Nolan is good at wrapping sincere emotions in a grand narrative, and his manipulation and expression are undoubtedly superb.
This story deduces a true father-daughter relationship that really crosses time and space.Although the theme of ""love through time and space"" has been ruined by countless romantic fantasy online novels, this film can make people cry, because it is so pure and true, so similar to our lives.Cooper does not have the ambition of ""my journey is the sea of stars"", but only wants to complete the task as soon as possible to return to her daughter to accompany her growth.In the autumn of human survival, Murphy's final choice of safe haven is still the place with the most memories of his father."

It was ourselves. Humans did not believe in the power of humans. They regarded all our unpredictable miracles as God Credit. Christopher Nolan has shown my world view so shockingly, I feel that I am so excited now."

It's not only a masterpiece for scifi genre.it has everything to makes it better then Aliens, 2001:a space odyssey, Back to the future even emotionally it's comparable with Forrest Gump,American beauty etc etc.
And there is also many many things to say about this one of the greatest movie of all time.Maybe I can start to write but also maybe can't end it.
How the lead actor not nominated for oscar minimus!!!
How many movie u saw in ur life which have a background music like this??
Oscar comitte need to repair I think."
" More than a Sci-fi movie!
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,10,"One of the best science fiction movie, created by my favourite director Christopher Nolan is about Earth's future condition. How a global crop blight and dust blow slowly rendering the planet uninhabitable. To save mankind Cooper (main lead) and a team of NASA researchers try to find out mankind's new home in another galaxy. This is the theme of the story. The journey! Beyond our thoughts, this film gives you another level experience about warm hole, blackhole, time and other many concept of galaxy. Nolan always focus on emotion more than explain a machine. Murphy's law and 5th dimension is just beyond our thoughts. Another fresh out of the box story. And it's amazing. It's more than a Sci-fi movie. Must watch film."
" The biggest enemy is actually human
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,9,"Three hours is the limit of a movie's viewing time. Even if the plot is unsatisfactory, the audience nestled in the black box will be restless. ""Interstellar"" just less than 3 hours, is on the critical line to exercise patience of the audience. In the last half hour, utterly covering his heart with his hands in prayer, Matthew McConaughey went further into the sky, and took a step back to lose all. The moment when I got up from the theater seats and finally returned to the earth after getting out of the cabin, I was generally terrified. In the endless time and space, we feel thrilled and tormented, with the protagonist wandering between hope and despair, exhausted. I very much agree with what the author in ""The Odyssey of the Abyss"" said: ""The film contains a nesting metaphor for the film itself. From the ordinary life into the dark theater, and in the darkness through the screen to another life , And then in another life, suddenly embarked on a wonderful journey, layer by layer into the play and layer by layer, with the flow of people out of the theater, and not into the streets and turbulent In the vulgar. There are several layers of dreams, there are many galaxy. The high stars are not related to us, it seems that one day they will cover our daily life. ""Therefore, it can be said that"" Interstellar Crossing ""is a mass participation. In the movie, I ca n't understand the wormhole, why Matthew falls vertically from outer space and can fall into a ridiculous five-dimensional space, although there is no ability and knowledge to analyze this hard science fiction from a physical point of view, But it does not prevent us from sitting on the seats of the movie theater for a long time, and using our own way to explain and understand. I 'm glad that Nolan played the finale of a magic stick without disappointment: the ""them"" who inspired the exploration all the way is us, we are the ""them"", and there are infinitely fragmented pieces in her daughter Murphy 's bookshelf In time, the father who regretted going to explore the universe returned to the point where the wrong decision occurred again and again to hint to himself. It's similar to the heroine who died several times in ""Terror Cruise"" but couldn't get out of the game. In this way, five-dimensional space is just a concept, not difficult to understand. I'm not a fan of Nolan, but in my own opinion, ""Interstellar"" is undoubtedly the biggest and most ironic movie in all his works and penetrates the topic of human nature. In the November file last year, I also watched ""Gravity"" in Daguangming. If we simply look at the theme of ""survival,"" the Nolan Brothers script would like to discuss the complexity of human nature and the mutual guidance of humanity in the collective subconscious reincarnation. The role is much more complicated than that of Sandra Bullock 's survival and jumping game; George Clooney faces the non-human suave and up-and-coming calm image of death in the vast universe, self-assured man in Matt Damon Dr. Eun looked vulnerable. There is almost no comparability in the text, but in terms of visual technology, there are exactly 80% gravity and 130% gravity Miller planet and hill planet, so that the actors do not have to float to perform, and it also saves a lot of later expenses. Rather than being played with by nature and the mysterious universe, looking at the biggest enemy in Interstellar from the surface is time, and then looking at the inner core, the biggest enemy is man himself. The universe is worn around, so innocent."
" The 2001 of our time
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is a beautiful film with heavy focus on sound, music and visual effects. It takes you on an emotional journey and truly shows how the medium of film can be used as a form of art.Yes, the story is good, the actors are great, the ending plays with your imagination, and of course you can't help but compare it to ""2001: A Space Oddysey"" because there are so many similarities.I've seen Interstellar three times now and the time in the Cinema was by far the best. It's difficult to give this film full justice without maximizing the sound and music. Still it gets better every time I watch it, as a story and as the art that Interstellar is. A much watch, and one of the best Science-Fiction movies ever made!"
" A Legendary Film. Mount Rushmore Level.
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,10,"I will never forget this movie no matter what, This movie made space travel feel like a reality. The time and everything involved in the space-time paradigm was made to feel like you could actually live these events. Now and forever this movie will be a timestamp for future space travel."
" Masterpiece!
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,10,"This movie has every element of a masterpiece. I can't find a single problem with Interstellar. As a child, I was fascinated by the stars and the cosmos in general. Interstellar took me back to those days when as a kid I was wondering what's going on up there. The plot of the movie is in near future, in a time when the earth can no longer grow seeds, and what are humans without food? They are going to starve! They need a new planet for surviving. Unlike many other Sci-Fi movies, Nolan didn't try to give a futuristic theme to his movie and rightly so. There are no Neon lights here! The story is about a pilot named ""Cooper"" brilliantly played by Matthew McConaughey who was once a pilot for NASA. But since the economy is down, NASA has shut down its operations and he craves for the time when he could still fly. Due to some gravitational anomalies, he somehow manages to find the secret location for NASA because they are still active secretly. As the movie continue, he is employed by NASA once again and with a team of scientists, they fly towards the Saturn where there is a wormhole and it's a gateway to another galaxy. Cooper has to left behind his family and especially his daughter whom he is very attached to. It's a heartbreaking scene when he leaves his house and starts his journey. In the foreign galaxy, there are three possible planets that may support the human life. They visit each one of them and a lot happens in between. Some of the crew members die and it's not a surprise because that is not a normal journey. At the end of the movie, we see human kind survived, but they are not on earth anymore. There are a lot of memorable scenes, like when their ship is passing by Saturn or when they enter the wormhole. The scene where Cooper sees 23 years of videos of his family from earth made me cry, and I'm not an emotional person. How must it feels to know you have lost 23 years of your children's lives for almost nothing? Hans Zimmer's music is one of a kind, and do not disappoint as always. It adds to the wonder and awe of the viewer about the amazing cosmos. Christopher Nolan deserves a standing ovation for this work of ultimate art. This is the first time that I have reached double digits for watching a movie. I have watched Interstellar 10 times and every time I enjoyed for the whole 2 hours and 49 minutes. It's safe to stay that Interstellar is my favorite movie of all time and the first movie that I am writing a review for it on IMDb. The whole cast and crew did an amazing job. I feel as though this movie was made for me and it captures the essence of what I feel about cinema and the cosmos itself. 10/10."
" Hands down the best mainstream Sci-fi movie
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,10,"This movie single-handedly quadrupled my interest in Cosmology. It's one of those epic masterpieces which leave you searching for words to describe the work. Sure it has its flaws, but the cinematography combined with the music by Hans Zimmer make it the best mainstream Sci-fi I've ever seen."

" A movie which creates my interest in Astronomy, time dilation and tesseract.
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,9,"Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar,"" about astronauts traveling to the other end of the galaxy to find a new home to replace humanity's despoiled home-world, is frantically busy and earsplittingly loud.
The film score is composed by Hans Zimmer who previously scored Nolan's The Dark Knight film trilogy and Inception.
In the film, there's background music called 'No Time For Caution'
which is enough to give you goosebumps by the music only. All the actors did a great job in their respective characters. Besides its a sci-fi movie just like other Nolan's movies, you feel a special strong emotional attachment with characters, even with the robots also.
This film has stunning graphics and VFX for designing space on the screen. Also, you can get the most accurate visualization of black hole till now.
Interstellar is a surely must watch a movie for a sci-fi movie lovers and one of best of all time. you will never regret it after watching it.
My biggest regret is i never got chance to watch this movie in cinema."
" Don't watch it a third time
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,8,"It's a great movie, but the third time I was watching it, everything seemed obnoxiously pretentious.
Especially the science dialogues, and an hour into the movie and everything sounds horrible, the acting as well, overacted.That's my advice, don't watch it a third time.When the movie came out it was celebrated for the scientific accuracy, now I feel like in about 50 years, when the science advances (hopefully) this movie will seem like that old short movie ""Journey to the Moon"" where the rocket lands in the moon's eye.Otherwise, the music is great, the story is beautiful, all nicely arranged."
" Inspirational, heart-wrenching and pioneering. A contemplation of humanity when facing the brink of extinction featuring the hardest decision a father has ever made
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,9,"This is a completely subjective review:
Where to begin. There's no movie like it and despite the possible scientific inaccuracies and plot holes, the movie shines for many other reasons. The visual effects and the CGI which aren't abused of as they share the spotlight with outstanding practical effects based on models and real-life robots; it's spectacularly jaw-dropping. The execution of the story, the overall ideas and concepts and the final conclusion drives the audience to a mind-blowing perplexion and awe.To see the portrayal of space travelling in such a realistic approach showcasing a how and what it would look like if we had the tools and means to do it is breath-taking and trully inspiring. The movie wanders into realms yet unknown to mankind today so it pulls from fiction and creative imagery to portray things but always stretching the scientific and theoretical basis as long as it can before deciding to make it up. If only the negative critics of this movie would take a closer look at how Christopher Nolan directs his movies they'd see the amount of research and scientists he works with to try to capture whatever he's working on as realistically as possible. He did it for this movie and he also did it for Inception and probably many other of his movies.But the ""interstellar"" space travelling is just a vessel for the real story the movie holds. A story about humanity and the tough decisions we will have to face when and if we face the brink of extinction and the planet can no longer host us as we keep mistreating it. This planet's resources are finite and with anything finite in quantity they're bound to run out eventually. And when that time comes, we will all hope to have the emotional and mindful strength the Coopers and the Brands had in this movie, to look at the others and realise if the fate of humanity lies in our hands, can we really do what's necessary and to do what's right?The movie launches into deep heartwrenching questions and scenarios where we are witness of the best and worse of humanity. And these are only intensified by the tense and scary space travelling slave of time and resources to make the trip possible.As for the story, I'm not yet a father and yet I feel the painful goodbyes and every stressful moment as time passes by and the answers of the movie are not yet found. The performances of everyone are real and evoque authentic reactions to many of the scenarios the characters are put through. You really do end up loving the characters you are meant to but you never really hate the ones you should because their motivations are well developed and understandable. This is really a human story, it isn't space cowboys or Star Wars with heroes meant to save the universe or the planet, these are people willing to risk everything to do it, no superpowers, lightsabers or laser guns.Ever since I first saw the movie I felt a deep connection with it. The movie makes you think, it makes you reflect on us and of what place we occupy in the universe. It makes you stare at the sky, at the stars and wonder what the universe holds beyond what we know. Are there others like us, are there other planets we could some day visit? How far can and will humanity's pioneering potential reach? These questions find a possible answer in the movie without using conventional and well-known ideas and concepts.Another worthy highlight of the movie: the soundtrack. The composer Hans Zimmer is known to be the mastermind behind scores like the Lion King, Pirates of the Caribbean, Inception, the Last Samurai, Gladiator ,etc. Today he's one of the most astounding composers in cinema and proof of that is the score of this movie. Tense and teeth clenching when necessary as well as inspiring and uplifting when the situation requires it. It's unique and holds secrets within I highly recommend you research when you have the time.IN CONCLUSION, the movie is a parade of fantastic special effects, music, tense and light situations, contemplative thinking and reasoning, an endearing but heart-wrenching story about humanity and the prospects of facing extinction and what choices and decisions can and should be made. The movie has more bullets in its magazines so unfortunately (or not, depending how you look at it) it requires more than one viewing to fully understand every detail in the plot and also visual cues for you to understand better the ""science"" behind it.Finally, it's true that when you first watch the movie you might end up confused or asking questions. And for those who have never watched a Christopher Nolan movie, this is common with his movies. They are meant to make you think and question what you saw, it's not for the light block-bustery seeking audiences who expected yet another Star Wars. If you take the time to look at what it's trying to say you will be treated with an incredibly well-developed story that may lack in craftmanship or other plot mistakes, but it makes up in a powerful story with well performed characters and an emotional journey. And for the engineers and other scientists like me, you'll probably want to fix the world and build a rocket after watching this movie. It's uplifting and inspiring for those who studied and dream to create and improve society by the use of technology, math and science. And remember ""do not go gentle into that good night""."
" One of the best movies I've watched
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,10,"One of the best works of Christopher Nolan. I've watched hundreds of movies and this one is definitely one the best movies I've watched.

" persevere faith

We are often not the genius of one ten millionth, and we explore on the road of life. In addition to courage and intelligence, perhaps more importantly, persistence and loyalty. Because there will always be a day when you will be disappointed by the flatness of life, you will lose confidence in your prospects, and even hate and hate all those who give you the role of life today, especially yourself!
We always inferiority and want to renounce ourselves. From nowhere to be able to pass, we blindly believe in deceiving and letting us choose to obey.
All of this, maybe only persistence and loyalty can give us the last hope."

" Nolan's ambition is hypnotizing in Interstellar
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"From the moment I pressed play on my television remote last night, my eyes were glued to the screen in fascination, stunned by the extraordinary ambition of one of this era's greatest filmmakers. My mind was captivated by his thought-provoking and moving story, and my senses were assaulted by my favorite composer's incredible score and the astoundingly beautiful cinematography of Interstellar.When the screen turned black and the credits rolled, I suddenly felt numb, amazed at the impact movies like this can have on an individual's mind and his point of view on the world.Fifty-something years ago, during the golden age of space exploration, people gazed at the stars with a sense of wonder, thinking about all the secrets that are just beyond our reach, awaiting to be discovered. But as time passed and no more men escaped the pull of Earth's orbit, this idolized view of the cosmos started to fade. For younger generations, like mine, exploring space is more the stuff of textbooks than real-life discovery. While humanity's understanding of the universe is expanding more rapidly than ever, it has become an activity for scientists to sink their teeth into; it is no longer a concern for normal people. As McConaughey puts it, we used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.With Interstellar, I think that Nolan wrote an hommage to humanity's sense of discovery, an ode to the great days of space exploration, while also pondering its future, and how it will undoubtedly play a crucial in the survival of mankind. I believe that those who fault the movie for being unrealistic are missing the point; after all, it's still science-fiction.Interstellar is in my opinion one of the most ambitious movies ever made, and it deserves all the praise for that. It's a movie I'm already dying to rewatch, and I think it fully deserves its five-star rating."
" Interstellar: A thought provoking gem! 10/10
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"I can't put my finger on why, but I shed tears during this movie at more points than any other movie I've watched. The moral of the story is that life is a process of constantly making decisions. You can make intellectual decisions, decisions out of love, or decisions just for survival. Most of the time when you play it smart and try to do the intelligent thing you'll still miscalculate something and make a mistake. As hard as it is it's always better in the end if you follow your heart, and chase the feeling of love. Decisions for survival is by any means necessary. You can lie or cheat for survival and do whatever you have to do. It's ironic that McCaughnahey doesn't want any of the important people in his life to ever feel like they're alone, yet he's willing to travel deep into space all alone as a sacrifice for others."
" Nolan's latest film is quite ""Stellar""
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"If this film isn't nominated for some awards at the Oscars, there's something wrong with the Academy. This is one of the best films of 2014, and it definitely deserves more than 73% fresh. That's too low of a score. I'd say it's more around the 90-95% range. It's an absolutely amazing film. Pardon the pun, but I'd even go so far as to say this movie is...wait for it...stellar. This is what ""Gravity"" should have been. It's a very thought provoking film and needs to be at least nominated for ""Best Picture"" at the Academy Awards. There are some issues with sound mixing where the sound muffles the dialogue sometimes, but according to Christopher Nolan, this was intentional. Don't wait for Blu-ray. See it while it's still in theaters! Your stomach will rumble when the ships take off, and you will be amazed at the visual effects. This film has plenty of heart, humor, and an intriguing plot that will make you forget it has a 3-hour runtime. It feels more like 2 hours.
Grade: A+ 10/10, 5/5 stars."

It really makes you look up in to the sky and makes you say ""are you out there?"".
Its a beautifull movie and I think that this deserves all the credit it can get.
The actors did an amazing job and during watching the movie I even let a couple of tears down.
If you think about watching this movie I just have one advice for you and that is ""Yes""
Even me being 17 years old and don't as nuch experience watching movies as an fourty year old would have I can say that this is a masterpiece."
" Incredible, Incomparable Beauty !‚ô•
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,10,"An Epic Allegory of love, emotion, science, universe, space, Faith, and some more other things! . . ."
" Amazing!
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,10,A true masterpiece! My head has been spinning ever since I saw this movie for the first time!
" Veeery long!
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,4,"It's very long, boring and irrelevant. I don't particularly like Matthew McConaughey's acting: his voice and tone are annoying and his facial gestures looked exaggerated and ridiculous to me. It's another of those films in which Michael Caine appears only for the money. I can't recommend it."
" Awe inspiring
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie leaves me in awe, even after the 10th viewing. The story telling, the acting, the music, and yes, even the science are absolutely meticulous."
" Cherish everything
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,10,"At its core, the film is a family drama about love and commitment between a father and daughter. The film let the most real and warm feelings and waiting for the human nature into the space migration such a huge and full of tragic human epic. In a grand narrative that encapsulates sincere emotion, which is what Nolan is good at, the manipulation and expression is no doubt superb. In this film, the sense of mission to save the children and the future of mankind, and the deep feeling between father and daughter to wait for each other, constitute a classical dramatic conflict in opposition, and almost always as the protagonist's motivation to advance the story."
" Christopher Nolan always leads to thrilling time and space implosions with a great focus on the technical side.
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,8,"But a little bit too much deus ex machina for me... which will mean a bit more for you once you see the movie. However, the ending bumped it up to 4 out of 5 for me."
" Thank you Nolan
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,10,Thank you nolan thank you zimmer thank you full cast
" It was Master Piece of Nolan
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,9,"I loved Mr. Nolan's Work every time,
but this one is beyond my love, also Music is Perfect and Magical thanks ( Hans Zimmer )."
" Captivating
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,10,This is a great film. If people cherish it as a film instead of a physics documentary you can make the most of it. The cinematography is just beautiful. And the music by hans zimmer is great. I recommend watching it in two parts in order to let the course of events set in
" Science and movie making go hand-in-hand
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,9,"Earth is dying down and the scientists find a wormhole in space leading to other galaxy with 3 possible planets for life sustainability. The space-time continuum and the 4D beings which plays with time. Normal people cant understand it because we being the 3D beings. We cant expand our mind to 4th dimension.
The father leaves his family and goes for this interstellar mission thinking of trying to save the people of world?! Will he be successful.
But due to the evil intensions of one person, faking the data of the planet, the length of mission exceeds way too beyond...
It shows humour is not the way to be friendly, deep conversations is! and we dont have to tell a lie but some form of the truth.
The sound, concept of movie,visual effects and everything is brilliant."
" Different science fiction movies
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,8,"Nolan's science fiction film is not a system with the traditional sense of ""science fiction film"". He put more emphasis on human power and emotion."
" Best movie i ever saw
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,10,I watched a lot of movies. But this movie is the one i watch at least 2 times year since the release. And everytime i see it i enjoy it just as much as the first time. Thanks for this masterpiece.
" Masterpiece
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie was just a masterpiece i would say it was the best movie i ever saw,the acting and the story line is awesome.Really recommend it"

Exceptional and interesting idea, makes me think that everything is possible. deeper."
" It's all time best.
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,10,This is the best movie I have ever seen in my life or probably could see in the future. Can't express this movie in words. It brought new sense of feelings and emotions with perplexing cinematography.
" A Film That Never Stops Giving
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is a masterpiece, simply put. It comes fully equipped with stunning visuals, breathtaking acting, and a story line that will drive you crazy. All of Nolan's films prove something to the audience, and this time around it's no different. Driven by the love for his daughter, Coop travels the universe in search of a new home."
" shock & excitement
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,10,"By the end of the movie, my tears kept flowing. The miracle was not because of the existence of God or some kind of unknowable power. It is ourselves. Human beings do not believe in human power, and consider those unpredictable miracles as God's credit . This is probably the movie that shocked me the most so far."
" Six years later
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie when it came out in 2014. I was six years younger back then. I remember liking it a lot, I remember how it all went and how it ended.I rewatched it tonight, six years later, and it really hit me deep. Deeper than any movie ever has. I cried a lot, but it felt good.This is a beautiful movie about love and hope. A movie that tells us what it means to be human, what motivates us to move forward both physically and philosophically. It tells us to trust in love, and to love in life. A movie about being alive.Truly a life changing experience.That is all, Slick."
" Creation of intensely mixed feelings.

" The best sci-fi movie yet
",2020-03-21 00:00:00,10,"I started watching this movie a year after it came out and I have been watching over and over again ever since. I feel so hungry and thirsty for more whenever I watch this. The music plays perfectly into the movie, giving you this sense of complete surrender to the movie.
This is actually one of Christopher Nolan's masterpieces and I would say it is the best sci-fi movie yet.
We need more like this!!!"
" Amazing!
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,10,What a fantastic story ! Agriculture is the future and every one likes corns
" Eternal love
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar is a movie of a complex debate about relativity, gravity and the meaning of time. It discusses how to strike a balance between the emotional exchanges of love, hope and salvation. The background of the film lies in a distant but recognizable future. The planet almost ran out of resources and the nations disbanded. The movie switches between unexplored and disturbing planetary worlds that exist outside the earth. There are many moments of tears between humans."
" WOW
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,8,"It was meant to be about Anne hathaway's beauty, but interstellar is filled with so many beautiful and breathtaking space wonders that it's really wow!!!"
" One of the best movies you've ever seen...but you won't realize that until the end
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,9,The most skillfully produced movies in all of cinema. Wonderful musical scores and excellent graphics. It was boring at the beginning but the scenes that seemed meaningless at first will come back to haunt you with new meaning towards the end. A true masterpiece.
" great movie
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,10,"The science in this movie is great, about time and blackhole. It is a magnificent masterpiece."
" Best sic-fic movie ever!
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,9,At the end of the day you should think about this movie. I think it's the best movie ever. Though its a complicated story but i think any one could feel about creativity after seeing this movie. Every moment of this movie is best sense. As its name as its story line. We need more and more movie like that.
" The best of all time

" Did I watch the same film as everyone else?
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,2,"To my mind a science fiction film should be either entertaining or interesting. This film was neither. It was pretentious, long winded and boring.
If it's not going to be entertaining it should at least be reasonably scientifically accurate.
Which it wasn't.
The idea of building an Interstellar spacecraft in complete secrecy with no budget was somewhat laughable given the developmental and logistical implications of such a feat. Then to employ a retired reluctant astronaut to fly it even more so.
Later on in the story, they land on a planet so massive that the astronaut orbiting it ages 60 years whilst they are on it's surface for 30 mins.
A human being on a plant that size would be instantaneously crushed by it's gravitational forces. Not mention the fact that they left earth's atmosphere and gravitational pull on a huge rocket ship but then land and take off from this massive plant in a small shuttle craft?
Not even taking in to account how the astronaut orbiting managed to find the food, water and oxygen to survive 60 years in total isolation on a small spacecraft.
To cap it all, after travelling for what would be thousands of not millions of light years he returns to find his daughter (albeit in another dimension) happily living her life whilst he watches her through some inter dimensional bookcase.
Story line: father loses daughter, father gets daughter back again.
Sorry, I think it's a case of the emperor's new clothes.
People spend three hours of their life watching this and then are too embarrassed to admit it was rubbish. They will then go on to tell anyone who sees through this pretentious ego trip as not intelligent enough to understand it."
" Love in human nature can actually break time and space and travel through the universe
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,9,"Even if the universe is far and infinite, even if time and space are confusing, even if they are just two small points that can be ignored in the extremely huge coordinate system of the entire world, and they have love, connecting these two points into a line segment. They no longer feel lonely with each other. This movie also reminds people to protect the environment. When the environment of the earth becomes one of the worst in the movie, people will also be greatly threatened. Therefore, it is even more necessary for us to think carefully and deal with it carefully. With the continuous advancement of science and technology, do not ignore our nature. From now on, we love science, love nature, and have a heart of advocating science."
" Best movie I have seen in my life #1 üòç
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,10,"This movie was the best written, acted, visual effected, etc. movie. This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. I am a huge Christo pher Nolan fan and this movie was his finest. Matthew McConaughey turned in his best performance of his lifetime. Anne Hathaway was an amazing supporting actress and compared to her performance in Les Miserables, I have no idea how she didn't get an Oscar for this. The visual effects were more than just Oscar worthy. They were pioneering. I have never seen anything like it. One thing I would recommend is having a little previous knowledge about space. Not like Einstein stuff though. I would recommend you see this movie as fast as you can if you are a Nolan fan or not. I give this movie a rating of 100 out of 100."
" Hole lotta love
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,3,"I like space epics 2001, Silent Running and even Dune. This film starts up on Earth. The world can't sustain crops for whatever reason, we've trashed the planet and our only hope is to go out into space and find a substitute.Magically a farmer who was part of the supposedly defunct space programme stumbles across an underground NASA mission to the stars. And just happens to be the perfect candidate to pilot a rendevouz reconnaissance expedition. Via a recently emerged worm hole.After travelling through the hole they need to rationalise their meet-ups, to use their resources wisely. We then get a wee dram of ridiculous drama. Followed by some interdimensional shenanigans. The end.However, dialogue is crass and pathetic. The crew has no chemistry. 'Coop' the pilot is only paletable later on when he finally shuts his mouth. It starts in an intriguing fashion, and then just gets stupid. The weird space time transend is okay. All in all - absolute rot.2001 or Contact is way more preferential to this film. As others have said it's basically a greatest hits of other sci-fi flicks. There's nothing new here whatsover, and it's no homage or beautiful retelling. I had been looking forward to this, but can firmly say, don't waste your time."

" The realistic space travel movie ever watched
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,10,"I would like to say the movie used the most real space and planet background!The story of all the movie is extremely touching, Cooper has to do his job and left his daughter, the first sad part! The wormhole in the movie is pretty excited, how fast the speed is while passing through the hole? But I'm quite confused who put it there and how? How could human being create a sphere hole? It didn't explain, and space-time distortion, is that real? I don't think so! Maybe it's just sci-fi! But if it did really exist in our real life, would be a perfect way to travel through the whole space!Second sad part is Tom sacrificed on Miller's Planet while experiencing the gigantic waves! The waves are pretty... like disaster! If the planet really existed definitely not suitable for human beings, 130% Earth gravity, 200meters high waves how could us survive, impossible!At last the plot is pretty pretty sad, how could Cooper left Brand behind, I think supposed to pass through together, I guess because the black hole is super dangerous, so he had to keep her safe, he went through himself, during the passing through the shaking hands with Brand made me super super touching, guess this is the space-time distortion caused this!Second confusing part did Cooper and Brand go back to Earth? Here is suspense! Guess Brand got back to Earth, otherwise how could she take the helmet off!Overall best movie to watch, highly recommend, even though the plot is pretty touching!"
" Simply the best
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,10,"As a person who is all about sci-fi, space and astrophysics, this movie just hits the perfect spot. There are A LOT of small details in the film, each one representing a certain theory or prediction from modern physics, which make the normal viewer wonder and the well-informed one appreciate just how much research went into making this movie and the attention to detail. It combines great action, drama and stellar visuals in a way only Christopher Nolan can create - mind-boggling yet interesting. And to top it all of, the score from Hans Zimmer is as great as always."

" Sensational.
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,9,"Watched this originally in theatres and resisted watching it again until I got around to buying the Blu Ray. One of the greatest sci fi films ever. It basically has everything. The plot, acting, effects and characters have me 100% involved from opening credits to the finale. I love this film so much."
" Daddy's in the bookcase!

" The greatest science-fiction movie, probably the greatest movie of all time, at least for me.
",2020-03-06 00:00:00,10,"Cristopher Nolan made such a beautiful movie, the sound and music they used is probably the most effective, heart-touching sound ive ever experienced in a movie. Wonderful storyline with great ending. Great character-shaping which leads to strong characters displayed in the movie. And to top all of that, the accuracy of universe and how it works blows my mind (at least theoretically), great decision to have Kip Thorne as their consultant.In conclusion, 169 minutes of masterpiece, you wont regret and you wont forget the experience watching this movie. Stop all your movie watch list or whatever, and just start watch this movie immedietly."

" Interstellar traverses singularities to signify the unequivocal power of love.
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,8,"""Do not go gentle into that good night. Old age should burn and rave at close of day. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Do not go gentle into that good night"". Humanity faces extinction. Blight plagues the flourishing crops and dust storms envelope the modernised surface. Earth, is no longer habitable. An apocalyptic vision of despair, a species survival succumbing to the hopelessness of one variable that descends tragedies and possibilities in equal measure. Time. It's running out.Former NASA pilot, now farmer, Cooper realises this more than most. The inevitability of destruction. But he pushes on, feeding his optimism. With his daughter Murph, they deduce a pattern caused by gravity variations in her bedroom. Binary code for coordinates to a facility destined to become the first gravitational propulsion space station. ""We're not meant to save the world, we're meant to leave it"", explains professor Brand, whom recruits Cooper to lead an expedition through a precariously positioned wormhole to another galaxy with a multitude of habitable planets. But how? Why? Who created the wormhole? Whose the ""ghost"" that embedded coordinates within Murph's bedroom? The team conclude inter-dimensional ""higher beings"" are guiding them to their destination. Surrounded by a colossal black hole aptly titled Gargantua. Yet the answer, the paradoxical nature of Interstellar, is far more personable than its scientific principles would allude to.Nolan's epic space opera is a grandiose tale of love. Love. ""Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space"". The bond between father and daughter, savaged by the loss of time that cosmically distanced them to estrangement. Science cannot quantify love. It's undetermined. A burst of emotion that moulds our own mentality, emphasising the human element against the cold stark backdrop of endless space.Nolan embeds the emotionality of adoration within a scientifically-driven narrative, bringing spiritual weight to a mind-bending screenplay. Brand's daughter, Amelia, symbolising that idealism seamlessly, as she believes her lover's planet, Edmunds, to acquire more positive telemetry in comparison to Mann's planet which is still sending out positive readings. She is ultimately ignored based on perceived bias. This intellectual conflict between mind and soul is what powers Interstellar, transforming a visual cosmological adventure into a melodramatic opera.The time dilation, provided by Gargantua, results in Cooper and Murph's eternal separation lasting longer than it seems. By simply performing a slingshot manoeuvre around the singularity, fifty-one years accumulates, resulting in Murph exceeding her father's age. Again, time is running out. It is a commodity. An essential resource. Nolan merges the parental ghosts of Cooper's choice with expendable time, producing an adrenalised pace once they traverse the wormhole. Every minute counts, for it could be a year back on Earth. These rushed aspects cause situations and decisions to become awry, however the principle of Murphy's Law takes precedent throughout. ""Whatever can happen, will happen"".This complements the impossibly dimensional third act, which attempts to answer several paradoxical questions, including Murphy's ghost. Much like the ship's stability when riding through Gargantua, the script just about holds its structure when visualising the tesseract. Undoubtedly complicated to imagine, let alone providing conceivable imagery for audiences to grasp. Yet, for all its dimensional beauty, one important plot point remains inconceivable. The watch. Transmitting quantum data using Morse code by manipulating the second hand of a watch? Surely the data must be enormous in size! And unfortunately it wraps up humanity's crisis all too neatly. It's, and considering the insistence of scientific accuracy, unbelievable. A minor complaint which many will rightly overlook.To transcend love, the performances need to be emotively involved through space. The space between space cannot hinder the emotional output. Fortunately, McConaughey's enigmatic performance capitalised on the human quality of Interstellar's script. The tears of timely loss he expels from his glistening eyes, especially when watching twenty-three years' worth of recordings that his children sent, emanated the power of love. Beautifully understated. Chastain also bringing a vulnerability to Murph's stubborn personality, endeavouring to appease the pressure in saving humanity. Hathaway, whilst exquisite at representing adoration, felt weak in delivering the clunky science jargon. Her character didn't particularly demonstrate her worthy candidacy as a member of the team, distancing our emotional investment for her. Also disliked the literal symbolism behind the aptly named Mann, whose yearning to survive shadows his pragmatic intelligence.The most intricate attribute that Interstellar is equipped with, is Double Negative's visual effects. Gargantua is intimidatingly gorgeous. Quite possibly the single best visual effect to ever grace seismic cinema screens. Effortlessly blending in with Nolan's insistent practical effects, particularly the Endeavour. Both Miller and Mann's planets were landscaped imaginatively to provide variation, and hosted ingenious marionette scenarios for TARS and CASE. Another noteworthy achievement is Zimmer's euphoric score. Again, one of the best scores available. Orchestral beasts, from pianos to organs, shroud the cosmos in grandeur. It unequivocally holds our attention throughout, harbouring a heavenly aura that stares down at Earth's destructive hell. Technically, this is one of Nolan's most ambitious and adept works of art yet.""Lazarus came back from the dead"", states professor Brand. ""Sure, but he had to die in the first place"", replies Cooper. And much like Lazarus, the ability to sacrifice one's self in a bid to sustain humanity's survival beyond our own planet, is the resurrection required to power Interstellar. Time. Love. Space. Complex intangible compositions that provide life to the soul. It gives, and it takes. Nolan's ability to comprehend these three variable and precariously place them into a sympathetic space opera, despite some implausible clunky stumbles, is the ambitious project needed to resurrect imagination."
" The true definition of masterpiece
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie in the cinema in the year that it came out and I absolutely loved it. Today, about 6 years later I've just finished rewatching this and I loved it even more, this movie feels like wine, the older the better. This was probably the only time that I cried in a sci-fi movie like I was watching some love drama, this is extremely touching and poetical! The Visual Effects Oscar was well deserved because the space scenes that this movie delivers are absolutely amazing, not only the ones in space even the shots on Earth were beautiful, but giving this only a Visual Effects Oscar is unfair, and this shows how great this movie is, the fact that even though it got an Oscar still wasn't enough, this deserved Best Picture and Best Director Oscars as well. The main theme soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is probably the best I've ever heard in my life and I think the Best Soundtrack Oscar should've been given to this movie as well, listening to that sound create so many different feelings, is really a masterpiece!
Nolan's work was flawless and you really can't ask more from a director, technically speaking this is perfect.
The narrative and that plot twist were also one of the most remarkable ones in the history of the cinema, and to me personally this is one of the greatest stories a movie ever told, this movie is about humanity, family, love, evolution, science, space, survival, perseverance, really this movie has it all and that fact alongside an unforgettable visual experience will forever make this one of my favorite movies of all time!"
" is this a masterpiece?
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,9,"This movie kept me thinking if this all can be real and if we anytime can se any of this or we can only dream about it. i watch it 3 times, and also the music is awesome"
" Particular?
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,5,"I don't have much to say.
The movie starts with a bad story. Not so really a good starting. Nothing special at least.
Over half of the movie is full of nonsense. I see humans who are fighting with each other for the personal glorification. Ignorant astronauts who don't know anything about the space. A lot of general egoism that isn't possible to be explained except in a crazy world where there isn't any hope.
Surprisingly in the last part of the movie something changed better and you almost can feel that this is a great movie and you didn't waste almost 3 hours to watch it.
What to say? Mega cool special effects. Great graphic with the editors. Good sound to make you involved in the scene. I guess a lot of money was spent on the movie.
If I could I wouldn't give any star because it's a mix of bad and good feelings and it's hard to say what's the rank of this movie.
Of course I think the script isn't good enough. Space stories are always involving people and even if it's a bad movie that's a great way to get positive reviews after all.
I just think that the movie isn't as good as I hoped. And you can easily understand that from the first 15 minutes.
Pity."
" Christopher Nolan is a creative genius and a master of his craft.
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,9,"I absolutely love seeing Nolan's imagination come alive on screen. While this movie does require a strong suspension of disbelief, once you get past that it really makes you think about some profound ideas, as well as telling more than one compelling personal stories that blend well with these themes.Interstellar starts a bit slow, but the payoff for the things it sets up is totally worth it and ties it together really nicely. There are a couple of scenes in this fairly long movie that don't quite hit the way I wanted, but it didn't take away from the overall feel of this deliberately slow paced film.Christopher Nolan is seldom trying to present a direct message to viewers, and by no means is that a bad thing. Just like Inception, its meant to plant imaginative seeds in our minds and make people think bigger about what our reality is, and what more it can be beyond what we can percive. He even brilliantly brings abstract concepts to life in a certain scene in this move I refuse to spoil.I hate seeing people who say these two movies ""don't make any sense"" or ""have too many plotholes"". You need to open your mind and realize the reason Inception and Interstellar are great is because of their ideas, not because they're perfectly grounded in reality. I get that Nolan might try to explain these ideas a little too much sometimes, but you have to establish some ground rules for such grand ideas.Stop saying ""this doesn't make sense"" They're Science Fiction movies!!

" The greatest sci-fi film/The greatest film!
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,10,"There are a lot of film titles you will hear when discussing the greatest sci-fi film of all time, A space Odyssey, Alien, The Empire Strikes Back, Blade Runner, The Matrix. Don't get me wrong, all are worthy titles and a strong argument can be made for each. One film you may not hear is Interstellar. As a fan from day one, and when I say day one, I do mean day one, as in the day Christopher Nolan announced his next project was a time travel film, it still dumbfounds me, and I will never understand why. Maybe it will be one of those films that is remembered more fondly as time progresses, maybe on the 10 or 20 year anniversary the film will find itself on more top ten lists, dare I say maybe at the top of a few. Don't get me wrong, the film was a hit. It grossed north of 600 million and recieved universal acclaim upon its release. Despite that, this film is criminally underrated.
As I stated earlier, I was on this film from day one. Being a huge Nolan fan, as soon as the announcement came, I was unbelievably excited. I couldn't wait for the release. When I saw the teaser one year prior to the release, I didn't think I could wait that long.
There were other films around this time that I was incredibly excited for. One was Man of Steel. When I left the theater from seeing that film, I was completely shocked at how bad it was. Growing up with Jim Carrey, I was also pumped for the Dumb and Dumber sequel. I won't even get into the depressed feeling I felt walking out of that theater. For this film however, I was more excited for than the other two combined. I remember walking into the theater, I began to become nervous that the film wouldn't live up to the extraordinary hype that I had built up for it in my head, seeing as how the other two hadn't. When I walked out of the theater, it took 20 minutes for my jaw to close. It not only met my expectation, it surpassed it. Nothing could have prepared me for the emotional roller coaster that was this film. The visuals were out of this world, literally and figuratively. The first movie that I saw and knew that the CGI would not age. The story was unbelievable. The classic story of the ordinary man thrown into the extraordinary situation. I didn't cry, but I easily could have. Everything that the actors feel, you feel. The performance from Matthew and Hathaway were spectacular. And that ending, WOW!
The fact that this film was not even nominated for best picture that year was the moment that for me confirmed that the oscars are completely useless. Not that this film needs any Oscar for validation. It is spectacular and magnificent in every way, and is not a film you will soon forget after viewing. It will make you think, make you cry, make you laugh, and make you wonder what the academy considers a great film. This review section was the first thing that had anything to do with this film outside the film that made any sense to me. When I read all of the rotten tomatoes reviews and reviews from a few other web sites I started to question whether they had left their thoughts on the wrong page, Thankfully on the IMDB user page, everything made sense again. I thought to myself, there are still people with brains and taste for cinema left in this world.
I won't spoil any part of this film because that would be robbing someone of something that won't come around again for a long time. If you haven't seen the film, just watch it. Don't read any more reviews, JUST.....WATCH.......IT"
" A movie you need to watch
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,10,"Christopher Nolan is definitely one of my favourite directors, his films always make you stop and think about things. Interstellar is amazing, I cannot find even a single fault in it. The longer you watch the more you get sucked into it.
The film evokes all sorts of emotions making you completely perplexed by the end of it.There is nothing else to say, except that Interstellar should be on everyones bucket-list of the all-time greats."
" ""2001- a Space Odyssey"" of the 21st century
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar might be the only science-fiction movie which is at the same level of Stanley Kubricks timeless masterpiece.
Christopher Nolan usually avoides CGI, but when he uses it, it is perfect."
" A modern classic.
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the best sci-fi movies ever.
The visuals in this films are breathtaking,epic and emotional,and with the epic soundtrack,they create an atmosphere that sucks you in like a black hole,and doesn't let you go until the end.
The characters are also well created,and the actors portraying them are at the top of their game here.Every scene is not wasted,and the emotions feel so raw that you can experience them yourself.
The plot is very interesting,with the help of Kip Thorne(the scientist that helped Nolan),makes the plot even more better.
The whole story is all about humanity,tenacity,and hope. It is a visually impressing film with deep messages and great acting.Nolan has done it again."

" A self serving pat
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,3,"Nolan and Nolan attempt to out stroke off each other by making a movie that just twists so many times and explains nothing that you seriously have to wonder ""why"". And then realize that with unlimited money and ego you can make whatever you want for nobody but yourself. There are so many forced performances, lines, edits, flashbacks/forwards/backs, and timeline overlaps that you wonder if actors where just given sides on the day and told ""trust me, i'll throw it all together and it wont make sense- Isn't that cool!!??"". No Nolan, no."
" Such a bad, controversial film, that I had to review here too.
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,1,"Where do I even start with reviewing this? I went to see this film in the cinema back in 2014, since I'm a fan of science fiction films. How could I have foreseen that it'll be such a ridiculous, long mess inside a shiny blender?3 hours, yet no character development. They were crying, but you didn't care. They were dying and you didn't care. But how could you care? We learned nothing about anyone other than McConaughey's character. The rest were there to either die or leave without us feeling distressed or caring at all. After all, for which character was the happy ending?Realism & Logic? Thrown out of the spaceship's window! A complete lack of expertise and professionalism from the 4 chosen astronauts. The 4 astronauts selected for the ""giant leap for mankind"" - the best people for the job - were learning the fundamentals of astrophysics (e.g. What is a black hole?) en route, inside the spaceship, outside of Saturn, with a whiteboard in a crash course! This does prove the ""scientific seriousness"" of the script, right? Sure! Oh yeah, they were also arguing over whether to go to the planet where one's boyfriend chills or to the statistically better one. Then, a not-supposed-to-be-hilarious cameo of another ""super astronaut chosen for the giant leap"" comes up and his actions are completely irrational. What about McConaughey's character's daughter, who wasn't talking to him from the ages of 5 to 28, because she was angry he had left because of work, yet one day she decides to send him a ridiculous message ""Hi dad. You son of a *****. ..."" and continue his work?! Lastly, I have to mention that ""Eureka!"" scene at the end... I am certain Archimedes slapped that actor backstage.As for the cinematography... 1998's Armageddon won! I never felt like I was in a big budget science fiction film about space and life in the distant future produced in 2014. I did like the depiction of the water planet, that whole scene kept me on the edge of my seat (let's exclude that illogically-designed ""super"" robot). But then, most of the time I was seeing the same, odd exterior side view of the spaceship supposed to depict the space flight. And then there were those Inception-like effects in another planet, where I only thought ""Heeey, that's from Inception, we're in a dream... a nightmare!"".Hans Zimmer, the music composer of the film, has made some masterpieces in the past. This is not one of them! Here, the music is simply annoying. A constant noise feedback, that is supposed to keep you on the edge of your seat.Conclusively, it should be obvious by now based on notable films, that the best way to get your message(s) across the audience is implicitly. Having to listen to frequent, shallow lines like McConaughey's character's ""Love surpasses any other power!"" or that ""Don't go gentle into that good night..."" every 15 minutes, I'm sorry, but the message, the meaning... my popcorn and everything is lost!I must admit it's annoying that the film is controversial and others find it an amazing film. This is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. And here, McConaughey is not likeable at all. It feels like he thinks way too much of himself and his acting. I miss his good, fun old days in movies like Fool's Gold (2008).
P.S. Did you realize, that at the end of the film McConaughey's character literally steals a spaceship from the ""spaceships' parking"" inside the bigger spaceship to go find a crew member at another planet? And that then the man in charge of the ""parking"" gets shocked as if someone just stole his bag of chips?!P.P.S. Intense, survival-threatening scene. The spaceship at high speed. An astronaut tells McConaughey's character what to do. And he replies, ""Say it, don't spray it."". What a humor! I wish that was the only one...P.P.P.S Don't get me started on the casting...!"

" The things we love most, hurt us the most
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,6,"I believe Christopher Nolan is possibly the best director around at present, and I love space/science fiction. I try very hard to go into films blind, knowing as little as possible. To say I was looking forward to this is a massive understatement, which probably is why I feel more critical over it than just passing it off as a mediocre movie, it is not.I had to watch it a second time to change my view from abysmal to, okay, it has some merits, but it ain't the story!Honestly I think my highlight to this film is the soundtrack, Hans Zimmer proves once again what a powerhouse he is in creating visual splendour out of sound. An absolute master in his craft.Visually it's also relatively stunning and has some intriguing concepts. Besides this though, I just didn't buy it, it was too unbelievable and all I heard before watching was how it was supposed to be accurate, or as accurate as is perceptible. I appreciate this was a big movie with the aim of appealing to a large audience, but how some of the script has to explain to the audience what is going on was just a massive fail for me and completely took away my immersion.I wanted to like this movie so much, I've tried watching it multiple times, I just don't. It has all the right ingredients for a sumptuous cake but it's like they forgot to put the filling in and it's just sponge, nice sponge, but not a sponge you would later tell your friends about, or post on social media (if that's your thing).I could point out specifics but they would be spoilers and I try to maintain spoiler free reviews. If you are interested in watching I would still very much say yes go for it, there's every chance you may think my review is unfair. I am definitely right about the soundtrack though, that is exceptional."

" The Science/Natural Disasters of Interstellar
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is a wonderfully made science fiction movie with very accurate representations of both modern science and natural disaster. In this film, Matthew McConaughey plays the role of a former NASA pilot named Cooper, who is an ambitious father that is willing to do anything for the sake of his children in a time where all of mankind is struggling to survive. The movie opens up with the image of a severe dust storm wreaking havoc over the U.S., as well as the whole world, which results in a terrible global crop blight. This type of natural disaster is one that the U.S. knows all too well after the Dust Bowl of the 1930's, as well as one that could occur at any time and was depicted very accurately. This has led to the realization that Earth can sustain its inhabitants no longer, and that something has to be done to save the future of mankind.
Cooper's family is struggling to put food on the table and make it by when he is approached by a brilliant professor named Dr. Bland, who is played by Michael Caine. Dr. Bland proposes his idea of travelling through a blackhole to another galaxy, or interstellar travel, in hopes of attempting to decide on one of three planets for mankind to call home in an attempt of repopulation and sanctum. Upon travelling through the wormhole and arriving on distant planets, the space team is faced with numerous obstacles. For example, the team comes face to face with huge tidal waves that stay stationary as the planet moves underneath, slamming the team and their ships into the water. Tidal waves are something very common on Earth and very detrimental to places such as the tropics. The level of destruction from these waves, as well as all the expanse of the tidal wave, that was represented in the movie was very accurate."
" Nat Hazards of Drought
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,7,"This movie is very dramatic and follows a few central themes of a dangerous life in space or a dying world on Earth. There is no distinguishable music, only an intense score that plays at the most stressful moments during the movie. The main character, Cooper, or Matthew McConaughey is seen as a distant father figure who leaves his family behind in order to travel through a black hole on Saturn. The point of this mission is to explore twelve potential new planets for humans to live on as the Earth is dying. The family lived on a farm that was often caught in major dust storms that required people to wear masks, hide in their homes, and eventually people left the town. The farmers also struggled with major drought, blight, dust, and the dying of their crops. Drought is a very dangerous natural hazard because people and animals will die without access to main food groups such as corn or wheat. Cooper's son responded to the dust with denial even though his wife and child coughed incessantly. This goes to show how a disaster can directly affect people, yet they will refuse to leave their home.
Cooper travels through space with a small crew on a small ship, all of which is from a NASA secret headquarters. He is one of the main pilots and engineers who is able to quickly solve but also fly the ship as to conserve fuel. Most of the space-science seemed to be portrayed accurately but I have no experience therefore it could have all been fake. The crew was also accompanied by an AI-like robot named Tars. This robot helped the crew solve problems, fly the ship, and gave them information when requested. Also, it was discovered that the professor who sent the crew knew that this mission was doomed to fail all along because of a stupid equation. Even his own daughter, Brand, or Anne Hathaway, didn't know this and was left in tears when she received a video message explaining this.
If the world was dying, why would a father leave his children behind to ""starve to death?"" The world or NASA should have used their advanced technology lab to find a way to make more food. I am assuming this movie is set in a post-futuristic world where humans are quite literally watching their crops die and families struggle for food. Yet, the movie nearly ends with Cooper stuck in a 3rd or 5th time dimension where he is able to ""talk"" to a younger version of his daughter through morse code and binary. This was very confusing as to how he went from being lost in space, stuck in time, and then ended up in a hospital bed on a station in space. Overall, I do really like this movie but I had to watch it multiple times to come to this realization."
" Absolute existential masterpiece
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is a movie that goes far beyond any other science fiction movie. At times, what is showed and carefully depicted, the principles and consequences of Einstein's theory of general relativity, provokes a genuine astonishment in front of Nature and its secrets, and admiration in front of the genius of the human mind. But it's also an incredibly moving film about the force of love between a father and his daughter, a love that transcends space and time. A film that makes you think about Being and Time : time is not a thing, there is time and time is the very essence of be-ing, be-ing is Ereignis. Unforgettable."

The intensity that draws you from the opening credits to the final scene is unbelievable. Greatest space film ever made no question. Top 5.. Maybe top 10 best Sci-fi film.

It has the signature hallmarks of a Nolan film; the way he builds suspense and creates an emotional response in the viewer makes him truly one of the best. This film has a great story line with all the fun theoretical physics you find in good Sci-fi movies. I just can't say enough about this one, it's a must watch!"

I'm completely out of words.I usually never leave a written review, but this movie really deserves it.Matthew McConaughey also deserves a mention. It is the best performance, he has ever delivered. He is so dedicated, and such a good actor. A big, big applause!I'm totally, totally mind blown and not sure what to say, other than, it's the best movie the world has ever seen"
" Christopher Nolan at his Best
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,10,"As an avid Christopher Nolan fan this is my favourite film he's done. There's so much to like about this movie. The spectacular special effects are mind blowing and captivating. Real life science backs up everything that is said and done throughout the story line. The music holds you in your seat and will blow you away, with the legendary Hans Zimmer behind it how can it not be good. Well it's better than good and every orchestrated piece fits so well with the scene it's paired with. The story line it's self is just fantastic and is even realistic, it could be a viable solution in the future of us. And finally the acting is fantastic from all supporting actors/actresses like Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway, Matt Damon, and Jessica Chastain!! But the star, the star of the movie, Matthew McConaughey absolutely kills his performance. He made me laugh, smile, and almost brought me to tears at certain parts, this is for sure one of his best performances, if you haven't seen Interstellar yet, then go watch it right now, then watch it again so you can truly wrap your head around the genius writing from Christopher Nolan and his brother!!"

" Astonishing until the ending
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is everything i've ever looked for in a film. The set decoration, the acting, the story, the VFX, and writing are all on a level which I have been searching for. On my first watch through (the first of 27), I was simply amazed at how immersed into the story I was. I have never been what you'd call a crying man, but many times did I face emotion that overwhelmed me. I am truly happy that I've seen this film.
My favorite film, The Truman Show, is yet to be taken from its spot, but nearly was. Interstellar would've been the perfect movie if it weren't for the too-happy sequel ready ending. I would've done much better with the film ending at Cooper floating, as seen before he wakes up in the hospital. I wouldn't be unsatisfied with the cutoff ending, but left wondering."
" Absolutely Mindblowing

" my favorite scfi movie
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,10,"Best movie of Christopher nolanWhen a wormhole (which hypothetically can connect widely-separated regions of spacetime) is newly discovered, a team of explorers and scientists embark on a voyage through it to transcend previous limitations on human space travel. The Hollywood Reporter said in addition to the official synopsis, ""The plot is believed to involve time travel and alternate dimensions, but other details are being kept under wraps."""
" Great Movie
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,9,"Directed by Christopher Nolan, Interstellar was a fantastic movie that encompassed everything from a second Dust Bowl to physics to space exploration. The plot of the story was a little hard to follow and towards the tail end of the film became extremely confusing. The movie begins by vaguely explaining that the world has suffered another Dust Bowl, resulting in limited food and resources. The conditions got so bad in the movie, the characters were forced to wear protective goggles, cover their mouths, and set plates/cups upside down to prevent dust intake. Thus, propelling the movie forward. The dusts implications were large as crops such as wheat and okra have become extinct with corn as one of the last remaining sources of food. As the story continues we come across a secret organization (NASA) working on saving civilization through space exploration and the theory of harnessing gravity to ensure the human race would survive, just on a different planet. In order to not completely spoil the movie, I recommend everyone watch Interstellar and see what events ensue, as it is a great movie!In addition, I believe it is necessary to analyze the believability of the initial 30 minutes of the movie as it touches on a climate related topic/potential issue. A second Dust Bowl, as detailed in Interstellar, is completely plausible in today's environment due to increases in global temperatures as well as extended droughts throughout parts of the world. The mass extinction of individual crops could be a consequence of additional dust bowls and simultaneously result in minimal future food resources. The ramifications of an additional Dust Bowl/s could be parallel to the first Dust Bowl in the United States' Midwest or even similar to the one portrayed in Interstellar. No matter the case, Nolan's depiction of the Dust Bowl is accurate and is a real-life event that should be avoided. People in the movie failed to learn in time the consequences of global climate change and were forced to leave Earth or perish after exhausting all of Earth's resources. So, what can be done to limit a second Dust Bowl? And what should have been done in Interstellar? The answer to both of these questions are the same, limit the burning of fossil fuels (prevent the continued warming of the atmosphere) and erect policy for tackling the issue of climate change (industrial activity, development, etc.). However, in order to complete these tasks all countries must be on the same page. Meaning every government recognizes the issue and agrees to work towards fixing the problem in order to save our plant and most importantly the Human race."
" THE MOVIE
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,10,"This is probably the best movie ever seen in 28 years life.It captures you and transports you. it excites you until you almost touch things that are immensely difficult to understand at times: space, time, the infinite, gravity, love ...This film that has almost nothing imperfect.
HANS ZIMMER's music is wonderful, it takes your breath away.
My favorite soundtrack and in certain scenes certainly makes 50% of the emotion if not 100%.Absolutely to see and get carried away."
" Sci-fi Masterpiece
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,10,"When hearing of Nolan's new film Tenet I decided to go back and watch all of his films. Before I watched this I'd watched Inception and loved that movie. I then watched this. And I was blown away. This movie is a masterpiece. From beginning to end this was outstanding.Easily the best thing about this movie is the relationship between Cooper and Murph. The beginning showcases a relationship between that two that helps show the world they live in. I actually never expected the world to be like this and found it really interesting a smart. Then it shows a issue that I'm sure many of us would have struggled with when we were children. This is handled beautifully and sets up the relationship to come amazingly.Along with majority of Christopher Nolan films the plot is outstanding with so many interesting concepts, twists and turns and overall amazing ideas.Obviously the cinematography is outstanding and the visuals are stunning.The casting is fabulous with the character full filling their roles perfectly. All of the decisions are believable and relatable with amazing satisfying action. They do this especially well as they don't have too many action scenes so they are able to balance it awesomely.As is the case with a lot of Nolan films I can understand if people become bored as with majority of his movie the plot is quite long. This doesn't bother me as I am not affected by this.Overall I love this movie. The characters are fabulously handled, with perfectly timed action and emotional moments. It is among the top sci-fi films and I love this as much as The Dark Knight."
" The greatest movie of all time.
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,10,"The greatest movie of all time, absolutely no doubt about it."
" Utter Nonsense
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,1,"Complete and utter nonsense, with incomprehensible dialogue, the film just gets sillier and sillier as it goes along. The (supposed) emotional denouement at the end of the film is completely devoid of any real feeling probably because of the tedium that leads upto that point & the lack of any connection to the main characters and the complete lack of any chemistry between them."
" A masterpiece !
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,10,"I don't find words to describe this great piece of art . Mr Nolan ,You are a genius , you are more than genius . I see that Nolan is one of directors that their movies are bigger than Oscar ."
" My review
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,1,This film made me like astronomy and I like reading about it
" Feeling confused why this was not in Oscars
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,10,"A fully shaped masterpiece. I don't know how many times this movie just made me hold my breath. This acting of Matthew McConaughey is absolutely brilliant and the scene where he listens to the messages thru the years I just really couldn't it was just devastating.
The movie is perfect from the beginning till the end. Truly perfect music and scene connection. I don't know if there is any person who doesn't feel emotional about this movie."
" Christopher Nolan is a genius!
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,10,This movie is one masterpiece which can not be ignore. Everything in this movie is so good that in the end you wondering what was this.
" Another great Nolan film.
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,7,Another great Nolan film. This is a good version of Gravity. In the end you are like what did I just watch.
" Through the Wormhole
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,7,"Yet another expedition sets off to find a new home for the human race; a sci-fi staple since at least 'When Worlds Collide' nearly sixty years ago.Doomsday in the movies has regularly been postponed over the years ('Lost in Space', for example, was set in 1997) and is this time further delayed until the mid-21st century when depletion of the means to feed ourselves (""the world needs farmers"") provides the ticking clock.Since most of the film remains indoors (thank God! Since the camera usually wobbles infuriatingly during most of the exterior scenes) the film remains pristine looking in the best tradition of sci-fi filmmaking (especially Anne Hathaway in a spacesuit). But it's nearly three hours long and somebody really should have told the cast - especially Matthew McConaughey - to stop mumbling, speak up and talk faster.And as usual any pretence at sustaining a narrative is ultimately discarded in favour of a welter of special effects."
" Best movie ever
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,10,I loved this movie so much. The concept the execution. Everything. Space movies are always a great but this one takes the cake.
" It's Good
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,9,Interstellar is one of the best films of 2014 but in my personal opinion it is not one of Nolan's best.
" Fantastic movie to enjoy
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,10,It a fantastic movie for you and your family to enjoy
" Masterpiece
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,10,"The best sci-fi movie I ever saw. There is some kind of emotion, that makes me cry at the end of movie!"
" Interstellar: an Astronomical Success
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar is one of the best films of 2014, despite its immense run time of 2 hours and 49 minutes. Interstellar is a Science Fiction drama. The movie really shows the Emptiness of space. The movie is directed by Christopher Nolan and scored by Hans Zimmer. The premise of the movie is plant life on earth is dying because the crops got infected with Blight and the massive death of crops has sent the whole world into a dust bowl, so humanity must colonize other planets in order to survive. The main character Cooper, who is played by Matthew McConaughey must pilot his ship through space with the help of Dr. Brand, played by Anne Hathaway and T.A.R.S. The military robot, played by Bill Irwin, to colonize another planet so the human race can continue living. This film features many good cast members such as Matt Damon, Casey Affleck, and Jessica Chastain. This entire movie is good and most of the science in the movie makes sense in it too.Interstellar is one of the most stunning visually and emotional films of 2014. The film is directed by Christopher Nolan, Nolan has made many other good films such as Dunkirk, Memento, The Dark Knight Trilogy, and Inception, all of these films are visually stunning. One scene in particular was rather Awe-Inspiring, there is a moment when they are on a planet with massive waves and with the angles that capture the waves at their fullest and really show the danger of the situation that the astronauts are in. The visuals are amazing and Christopher Nolan really delivers, you can tell that he is experienced in capturing incredible shots especially with his past movies like Inception where he folds a town in half. This movie shows the talent of Christopher Nolan fully and leaves me awe-struck at the end.The film also sounds amazing and features the musical talents of Hans Zimmer, who has been featured in Inception, Gladiator, Dunkirk, and The Dark Knight Trilogy. Hans Zimmer has been known to deliver and leave thrilling Soundtracks throughout all the movies that he produces. As for and Interstellar this is no exception, throughout the movie he builds up the music making it more and more intense and emotional for the audience and he releases all of his talent in the song No Time For Caution, this scene had me on the edge of my seat, the camera was spinning all and focused on the spaceship, the camera matching its rotation while the music is building extreme tension for the audience. Hans Zimmer demonstrates his talent of making music that builds the scene up and allows it to become the best scene it can possibly be. It's hard to make a good movie without a good soundtrack and Hans Zimmer delivers it through the piano and violins throughout the movie. This Soundtrack is breathtaking and had me at the edge of my seat holding my breath when Hans needed to build suspense.Matthew McConaughey was the main character and he was not the right person for this movie, he plays the dad and ex-pilot character of Cooper very well but the audience is sidetracked often because he is very quiet over the entire movie making it difficult to follow. This speaks more to the acting of Matthew rather than the Directing of Christopher Nolan. Instead it would have made more sense for Matt Damon, Paul Rudd, or even Casey Affleck as the main character of this movie. I believe this movie would have been even more successful and Emotional with these actors playing Cooper instead of Matthew McConaughey.Lastly, Interstellar is one of my favorite movies of all time due to the visuals that are in this Science Fiction Drama. The movie as a whole is very long and manages to stay interesting and powerful to the audience due to the Soundtrack and Visual effects brought on by the Captivating Christopher Nolan. This movie is very emotional and the raw emotion that Cooper gives towards the end of the movie resonates through the audience. Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer Really delivered an amazing movie and I was left speechless at the end of it, truly a science fiction masterpiece."
" Interstellar is Out of this world!
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar is a fascinating film that makes you think about this world, but also question everything you know about reality. The film provides mesmerizing yet realistic displays and realistic to depict a world that could be in our near future. Mathew McConaughey's performance this a must watch Sci Fi thriller.
The film starts with the setting of a somewhat dystopian future where the world is running out of food and dust storms are raging across the globe, and with what appears to be elderly Dust Bowl survivors of 1930 talking about their experiences . To flipping over plates to keep the dust off and wearing masks to protect them from the awful dust that is slowly suffocating everyone on earth. Food is the real problem: corn is the only farmable crop in these dusty, dry conditions. But how long until can they farm? Are they doomed to die on Earth as it continues to get worse and worse?
We are soon introduced to our main character, Coop (Matthew McConaughey) who used to work for NASA, his daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy), his son Tom (Timoth√©e Chalamet) and finally his deceased wife's dad, Donald (John Lithgow). Coop dreams of flying a spacecraft but believes he was born 40 years too late and 40 years too early as Coop had flown for NASA many years ago, before it was disgraced for faking the moon landings to trick the Soviets into bankruptcy But had instead just gone underground, and we're working on a plan to save humanity. By sending people to space. Coop now is the only remaining experienced pilot, and NASA need him But he must make a choice: either try yet leave his Family behind, likely to never see them again. Or stay with his family likely dooming humanity to starvation, Is Humanity Doomed or will they be saved by Coop?Interstellar was written and directed by the fantastic director Christopher Nolan who unsurprisingly directed great films like Dunkirk in 2017 (that is known for its amazing cinematography) and The Dark Knight in 2008 (known for fantastic plot). He can write a great story. Composed by the brilliant Hans Zimmer who also Composed for the Lion King (1994) and Inception (2017). The music allowed for the story to drip with emotion making the soundtrack alone an intense thriller that will shake you to your core.Despite the script being such as the line about how love connects everyone throughout dimensions, it is still a very enjoyable experience. There was a great deal of computer simulation to create eye dropping ranges of color and spectacles of scale that are sometimes hard to comprehend how they could exist. The cinematography was also fantastic making it feel like another world at times, like your exploring a vast, empty world. Similar to the first Star Wars film A New Hope (1977), that capture the magic of space by showcasing the emptiness and scale of the galaxy and even the sounds of space.Still, I feel like it didn't answer enough questions. Sci fi needs to seem realistic. This game changing ""worm hole"" was placed near us to save us, why not put right outside of earth? Another problem with the film was the sound mix at times especially from Mathew McConaughey as their were scenes I couldn't understand a word he was saying only for the scene to be saved by subtitles while watching the film at home, making me desire for some reshoots as the clever audio sometimes doesn't get to shine as much as it could due to the overbearing music that dwarfs an intense scene because it doesn't allow for these actors performances to be shown at their full potential and rather sounds like it's behind an iron door, they have an amazing sound selection for the film but the snipping and audio levels sometimes ruin it completely due to some simple audio problems that could easily be fixed with basic editing.Despite Its flaws, I love this film. I would recommend this those who love a good Sci Fi like Star Wars, Star Trek, or 2001's Space Odyssey. They all including Interstellar capture that sci fi space magic that captures the wonder of all sci fi lovers who are curious of what the future holds. But don't forget to set your watch to the future! Highly Recommended! 9 Stars out of 10!"
" Amazing Work
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,10,"An integrated work in all aspects, whether output or scenes, even music is fictional music and Hans Zeimer is a creative person. Thanks Christopher Nolan."
" This is the epitome of a movie, adjectives can't desribe it
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,10,"I made this account so that I can just review this movie.
So I'll keep it plain and simpleIf you haven't watched the movie yet, you're making a HUGE mistake
It makes you rethink every decision you've made and it makes you
really appreciate time and past. The acting is brilliant, the plot is brilliant,
the visuals are brilliant. A flawless piece of art"
" Greatest movie ever made!!
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,10,"This movie moved me like no other.
A story that is intriguing and interesting not to mention emotional.
A soundtrack worthy of an Oscar!
A movie you have to watch multiple times to get the full impact of the story( I didn't mind multiple viewings)
Along with the movie CONTACT the best 2 sci-fi movies ever made!"
" Outstanding film
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,10,Fantastic - just finished watching and I genuinely have no words right now
" A Cinematic Masterpiece
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,10,"Although, as a film, Interstellar was out of this world in its storytelling, CGI effects and phenomenal acting, nothing raises this movie over the bar other than the powerful score composed by none other than legendary Hans Zimmer. A greatly underrated film which, in my personal opinion, was Oscar Award worthy. A true cinematic masterpiece which will continue to amaze for years to come."
" Deep-thinking, awe-inspiring, and well paced.
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,10,"You know that part of your brain that like to just imagine about the extents of science and space? This movie takes that t a whole new level, gives your brain clay to play with, and blends perfectly the stakes, conflict, and relationships. Matthew McConaughey pushes the potential of his acting ability and the characters are incredibly real. It even - without spoiling it - touches into the supernatural and metaphysical yet it draws a very long line that can connect that and science, accepting radical Scientology to be the same as perceived theology."
" Best Nolan Movie Ever
",2020-01-14 00:00:00,10,I thought this was an incredible movie from it's story to visual effects to the character's journeys. One of my favorite movies ever.
" Perfect Sci-Fi Film
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is how a good sci-fi movie should be.Interstellar is Christopher Nolan's experimental space epic almost half a decade in the making. There was extra work taken to ensure scientific accuracy and artistic quality. All of it pays out at the end of this unforgettable film.Interstellar is a beautiful, slow yet intense move that spans for about three hours. Though it does take time to move the plot, more is done in for the sake of exposition and world(s)-building. The visual effects of this film are astonishing.Also, I applaud Nolan's decision to hire Hans Zimmer on this masterpiece. Without his mesmerizing work, this film would have felt incomplete.Interstellar came out at a time there was waning government interest in space. Funding was cut for NASA and we were unsure if we'd ever launch a space mission again. But with the success of Interstellar among other events, we're back to seeing space exploration in the cultural mainstream. The cultural impact of this movie cannot be forgotten when discussing this film.5/5. Favorited. Stellar (heh) performance by all actors and those who worked on this film."
" Best space movie I've ever seen!!
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,10,"This is truly a masterpiece and one to be watched in cinema! Breathtaking shots of Saturn and black hole. keeps you entertained all the time. It has everything - science, drama and well directed space travel. One of my all time favourite and will be forever."
" Best movie I have seen in my life.
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,10,I cant say soo much things but best movie I have seen in my life.
" A Type of Movie I Wish There Was Much More Of
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,9,"It can be hoaky at times, and a bit on the nose, but dammit this movie is great.For whatever it lacks in occasional subtlety it more than makes up for in ambition and sheer Sci-fi spectacle. It's no 2001: A Space Odyssey, but man it's an extremely entertaining popcorn hard Sci-fi romp.One of my favourites from the 2010s."
" Possibly the worst movie ever mad dllar for dollar/
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,1,"Did you want plot holes piled on plot holes, did you want utter fantasy disguised as science in a hard SciFi movie, did you want one dimensional characters, and did you want Looooooovvvvvvvvveee to magically transcend time.,and space? If so this dreck is for you. Possibly the most overrated movie in history. Seriously 8.6? What the heck is wrong with you people? It is a POS."
" Using the genres full potential of challenging storytelling
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,10,"Through the history of movies there has been countless titles that has left us both breathtaken and emotionally engaged. These set the examples for future generation of films in terms of genres and inspiration. Interstellar is not considered to be a regular sci-fi movie. It¬¥s more like a drama set in a space environment which makes it the more interesting. The movie focuses on storytelling, the relationship between a father and a daughter, rather on some generic space adventure.Nolan¬¥s Inception played mind tricks on us all and challenged our perspectives of what human reality really is. Inception was still set on earth with customs and dreamed realities, highlighting how we can view things different in our daily lives. Interstellar did though take it to a whole different level. Dealing with meaning of life, the religious belief of what our purpose or not is here on earth. How ""unimportant"" we are in our existence in a bigger picture, formalising what is actually worth when looking at life from that view?I believe that Nolan¬¥s excellent work in using the sci-fi genre in manifesting certain key questions about our existence was used in a brilliant fashion. Not using any overly-hyped CGI or distractions to actually tell a story that leaves us asking ourselves important questions in life. Open up entirely even if it left us hurt and crying in our seats."
" Loved every second of it
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,10,"As a space lover, this film was perfect to me. This film is amazing, from the plot, to the visual effects to the incredible soundtrack. Interstellar has the best music in any film."
" Almost Perfect
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,8,It's the best movie and it's so amazing but not the best end
" Best sci fi movie you will see
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,10,One of the best movies I've seen. Should've had oscars galore
" Smh
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,6,For people that don't know that 2001 the space odyssey exists.
" A perfect science-fiction masterpiece
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Unforgettable music from Hanz Zimmer, excellent scenario and directing from Mr Nolan, incredible acting : everything is perfect. A true Nolan masterpiece like Inception and The Prestige.
You'll never look at the sky or see space programs the same way.
About the end:
I have heard about of people said that the end of the movie is a total nonsense and that it destroys the movie.
I do not think so even though I respect everyone's opinions.
The end is subjected to interpretations of your own and that is Nolan's objective like in Inception.I think that when Cooper crosses the black hole's horizon he died but just before dying he, as described by Dr Mann before, imagined a path where he succeeds, he struggles to feel the love he has for his daughter and because deeply, he feels guilty knowing he failed. This is my opinion, I may be totally wrong or not but that is how I see it after having watched that pictured multiple times."
" Best movie of my lifetime
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,10,"It's a Sci fi with a strong basis in physics, and an extreme emotional ride with a soundtrack that tugs as hard on your emotions as the story. I've seen it 4 times and it gets me every single time."
" One of the best movie
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie was one of the best scienst fiction movie i have ever seen, i have never seen the scenario like that.i recommend you to watch the movie as soon as possible"
" wasted time

" The Most Important Film Ever Made!
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,10,"This movie is the most important film ever made, and I mean that.First lets start with the basic premise of this movie which I hope it creates awareness about, which is the idea that the planets resources may very well some day be depleted. And then what?This film is directed by Christopher Nolan, one of the greatest directors of all time next to Francis Ford Coppola and the Coen Brothers. And this is his greatest work of art. And with it comes a handful of the best actors out there.This film explores all of the deepest topics in existence. Time, space, relativity, deep space travel and searching for other planets that could sustain life, how that kind of travel could be possible, how that kind of travel and living on other planets would effect how time passes for the space travelers, how they would age differently than loved ones back home and how that would effect their relationship emotionally, how gravity is related to time and other fascinating theories in physics, and this movie even explores what it might look like inside of a worm hole, black hole, and the fifth dimension!And whats more is that they had a team of the worlds leading physicists consulting with them on the film to make sure that all of the physics portrayed in the film are 100% accurate down to a ""T"". They even released an entire textbook about it afterwords! This movie is more educational than your average documentary, and yet it is not a documentary, it is some of the greatest storytelling you will ever experience.This movie very elegantly connects themes of existentialism/life/death, philosophy/metaphysics/spirituality, physics, relationships/emotions, the future of our world and the universe at large in the most artful cinematic way. It will literally warp your mind and leave you feeling different for the rest of the day. This movie is just so intellectual and so emotional...it is one of the most cerebral experiences you may ever have. It will provoke so many different thoughts and feelings while you watch it, it is just phenomenal. In fact it made me cry more than any movie ever has (I cried 4 times when I first saw it, and I still always cry hard at the end every time).And this movie is so visually stunning, the shots of outer space and different planets are just breath taking. You will really feel like you are in space with them and will be completely absorbed in the movie, and afterwards the world you return to will seem bleak in comparison. It is such an incredible work of art.I rarely ever want to see movies more than once. This movie I saw 4 times in the theater when it came out. I've never done that before, but for all these reasons and more, I just couldn't stop watching it. Then I bought it on DVD and keep watching it again and again since. This movie is literally out of this world. It is a must see for everyone. It is the most important movie of all time. I'd give it at least 11 stars out of 10."
" Astonishing filmmaking
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,9,"I am a huge StarWars fan, but I have to say this is the definitive sci-fi film for a generation. It captivates the audience and challenges the laws of the universe. A must see."
" 9.5*/10~Overlooked/Neglected Masterpiece!
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,9,"CHRISTOPHER NOLAN-This Man is the TRUEST DEFINATION OF GENIUS,
What a Mind he has got !
Just Brilliant!
I want to give a Big Bow to this Man!
HUGE HUGE HUGE RESPECT FOR THIS MAN!!THE BEST SCI-FI EVER MADE !!Has all elements of an ENGAGING CINEMA.Never thought it would be so Emotional..
Many scenes of it made me cry alot..And Mathew McConaughey,Excellent Act by him too!Currently,8.6 IMDB Rating refers
It is Much Underrated and Neglected/Overlooked MASTERPIECE..WILL ALWAYS REMAIN IN ""MY ALL TIME TOP 10"""
" Unrivaled Masterpiece
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,9,It's now 2020 and I've just finished watching this almost three hour Odyssey. I'm still in shock at how amazingly written it is. Nolan you're a genius !!
" YOU MUST WATCH IT
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,10,"Imagine if this is real and somehow when we die or something we can see ourselves while living, and try to warn ourselves. I don't know, but I guess it's painful, I love how this movie reminds me of how huge the universe is."
" Beautiful
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,10,"I've nothing really to add to much better reviews than I'm capable of, and I'm only really writing this review to counter the unfathomable 1 star 'reviews'.
This isn't just the best sci-fi film I've ever seen, it's one of the best films I've ever seen. It's an incredibly powerful, beautiful film about humanity (as are the vast majority of sci-fi films). Not only does it stand repeat viewing, it gets better each time I watch it. It's perfect filmmaking."
" STORY MIND BENDING AND DIRECTION SUPREME.
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,8,Story mind-bending and Direction and Sound/Music Design supreme. Superb interpretations
" no 1 sci fi movie of all time!!!
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,10,"This movie for me, since the opening of the story, where the girl said there was a ghost in her room. from there I know the end of this story. And can't wait for the exciting episodes where Cooper explores his time"
" Nolan tries way too much
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,8,"The plot just ruins it from being a 10/10, especially Anne Hatheways character, the ~nothing~ first act and the ending. However the second act is a must watch, especially in a large IMAX cinema just for the grand epic scenes such as the Water World with the immersive soundtrack."
" Hungry
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,9,"Well, the world needs food.
Next we take a rough ride trough the cornfield and destroy a lot of food.....to hunt a drone.
Reaching that point In the film, I stopped watching because I thought I was not taken serious by the filmmakers.Because of only app. 15 min. viewing, my critics are not of high value, I guess."
" Best movie ever made in my opinion
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,10,"The work behind this film is enormous but here are a few things that is worth mentioning about it:
1. The film took scientists into account to make it as accurate as possible
2. The little details everywhere
3. The innovation (they designed the robot)
4. The story is crazy and complex
5. You'd probably have to watch it twice to understand it and appreciate it all, at least I had to."
" Best
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,10,Best science fiction movie ever I watched ! We want more this type of movie ! It's awesome concept too and theory is also great ! Great !
" This is not a good movie
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,1,"This is not a good movie. The story itself is weak and unrealistic. Seen from space exploration and physics viewpoint, it's a laugh. E.g. in real life it takes weeks to prepare a launcher, in this movie they jump in and on their space crafts as if it were scooters. Not to talk about the laws of physics and electromagnetism. Every frame in this movie seems to conflict with these fundamental laws. One can stretch reality to such a level that it becomes absurdity. That's why this is not a good movie."
" A Masterpiece
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,8,"Movie was amazing but something just annoyed me (the Saturn thing, blackhole etc.)"
" GREAT STORY COMBINED WITH PHYSICS
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,10,After i watched it i was full.Film helps you to being insterested to science especially physics.After i watched i searched information about quantum physics and space.You should definitely watch this.It will show how can a sci-fi film awesome.First time i really saw a real SCI-FCI film.
" The film which changed my attitude to fantasy films
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,10,I didn't like fantasy films until I watched the Interstellar. It impressed me so much... I think it changed the way I treasure my life and the world around me.
" Pretentious pseudo-science and wrong on so many levels
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,3,"Apart from the fact that I knew what was going to happen as soon as the books appeared, this movie is pseudo-science from a director who thinks he's clever and evidently fools some people into thinking he is. But this isn't a bright movie. The science is schmuck. Carl Sagan had already dealt (brilliantly) with the time travel idea in his series Cosmos. The one certainty of space-time (wormhole or not) is that you cannot go back. The past really is just that, the past.Take out that simple concept and the movie has very little left. So I can only imagine the 10* reviews are by people who never spend time thinking about ... time.And, no, we shouldn't 'rage against the dying of the light.'"
" Favorite movie of all time
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,10,"The story, music, actors, plot etc are just perfect. By far my favorite movie of all time."
" Exquisite
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,8,"Opinion and taste are very individualistic. What makes someone buy a film, even after they have seen it in it's full theatrical glory to watch again and again hoping to experience the magic felt in the cinema. Films like this were made for the bigThis is a truly phenomenal Science Fiction film which delivers in spades.
A stellar cast and performance that does not disappoint. I have recommended this film more than any other I have seen."
" An Incredible Space Travel
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,10,"I think that Interstellar is a super movie, it was released on November 5th 2014. Interstellar is a Scie-Fie, adventure, action and drama movie and I would like to say that it's also a comedie movie because I really laugh at the begening and you can't be bord because it's too captivating.
Interstellar tells a story about a team who is traveling the space to find a place who is survivable for the umanity, and I loved this story immediately. I think that the plot is one of the most awesome I have ever seen.
The actors played super well specially Matthew McConaghey because sometimes I think he was not human. Anne Hathaway is incredible too , she is so perfect on her roll. The special effects are awesome and the soundtrack give to the scene much more importance because, for example the explosions are very real. To finish I would like to say that if you love space and adventure then you must see this perfect movie"
" Perfectly Executed Sci-Fi Thriller
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,10,One of Christopher Nolan's greatest films in terms of abstract concepts of space and time. What is even more impressive is that many of the concepts used by Nolan are deemed possible by science and research. A great plot full of twists and a must watch
" WTF!!
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,10,Well that's how you make a Science fiction movie. I watched it fourth time to completely understand.
" Overrated
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,6,"I'm going to admit I'm not the biggest fan of Nolan's work. I don't consider him a bad director, it's just his kind of work it's not for me.Interstellar is not an exception. Continuing in Nolan's line, the movie has a long, long introduccion. Yeah, that's not necessary bad, but the problem is you could quit 20 minutes and it wouldn't affect the main characters. Of course, you must to know what you have to dispense.You can see a little poetry in McConaughey's character. As the movies moves on, the character gets tired and so do the actor. Not something bad, even it can be very cool for someone, but I just don't like to see Matthew tired of acting in some scenes in the second but especially in the third.You'll see I'm not criticizing bad things. I'm just saying things that I don't personally like, so it's my point of view.Sometimes the movie tries to blow your mind. And sometimes It makes it. For example, with the last scenes. So, what's my point? My point is that if you're a Nolan fan, go and see the movie. If you like some space misteries like my case well... maybe you don't get as much as you want.This is just a Nolan movie. And this is just my opinion."
" Best SciFi ever made?
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,9,Gripping story line with terrific acting Matthew absolutely is in his element in this.Great story with great actingWithout out looking into the realism or physics of it too much it is outstanding. Could watch over and over if need beHighly recommend
" Brilliant, moving, entertaining
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie again today for the third time. I loved it. So well written, directed and acted that it really makes you feel you are there. Matthew McC is the best he has ever been in this role as are many of the stellar cast. The story builds slowly and is complicated which makes it even better on the second and subsequent viewings. The effects are brilliant. All in all a superb piece of filmmaking and entertainment. Kudos to everyone involved."
" Best movie in this genre
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie so much!

",2019-12-15 00:00:00,7,"Interstellar is deep minded and very good film made by one of best directors working today,nolan showed his masterclass of directing in every ascept,following by masterful acting of most of cast expecely mcconoughy and hathaway who were likeable but far more deeply connected to the plot that leaded to satisfaying ending,when they started to explaining to audience what was heppening towards end it was done in smart way and not in our nose pushed,interstellar is defienetly one of better sci fi films of last years with some scenes that could be more explored cause i think they had more to show us then they actually did"

",2019-12-12 00:00:00,10,"When you mix a super photography quality, perfect mixing of the sound with the images, reaching the goal of representing a difficult environment like the universe.
This is for me the best movie I ever seen about space, the story is a bit sad in some moments, this help to jump into the movie.
I looked it 5 times at least, it bring you to a different level of imagination, and congratulation to Christopher Nolan, that realized one of the biggest movie in the cinema industry.

" Nolan Masterpiece
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,10,"Visual: 5/5
Sound: 5/5
Story: 4/5
Cast: 5/5
Nostalgia: 1/5Visual 5/5
As said in the title this movie is a masterpiece from Nolan and delivers an amazing visual journey through space. The excellent camera adds to the extremly well designed screenplay.Sound 5/5
The sounddesign finds the perfect moments to keep the volume down while being loud at intense moments. Paired with an awesome Soundtrack from Hans Zimmer which fits perfectly to every single scene the sounddesign becomes an perfectly designed work.Story 4/5
The story tells a pretty serious scenario and wants to have you think about it very detailed. While this can absolutley work and create an amazing journey if you really dive into the movie its also its biggest weakness because it can become very hard to understand all the things that are happening if you dont pay attention to every single detail.Nostalgia 1/5
Well its not like a Star Wars movie where nostalgia can sometimes confuse an result. So i think this guarentees my honest opinion about this."
" Ambitious and awesome, but at the end of the day, it's a but overrated.
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,7,"So many things about this movie were great. The set up, cinematography, directing, effects & scenery, etc... However, the very ending has such a clean wrap-up and lack of emotional impact that it doesn't really fit well with the movie, in my opinion. Also, the acting falls flatter than what we've come to expect out of Nolan's films. Not to say it's bad, but some people have been praising McConaughey's performance and I feel like he's kind of just phoning it in for most of the film. Also (no spoilers) there's a scene where he watches a video tape and gets emotional; and I just could not relate to the way he was reacting at all, I understood certain elements, but the way he presented it was not the way I would've pictured it. Although I sound like I have a lot of gripes with this movie, I really did like it. There's really a lot of amazing parts about this film. I just don't think it's as monumental as some people are making it out to be. And I also noticed that it has a higher score than The Prestige on here and that is just absurd."
" Amazing
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,10,"One of the best films ever made! Stunning visuals, powerful acting and very close to scientific facts. Loved it start to finish!! Thank you!"
" Full of nonsense!
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,1,"The screenplay is so bad, I don't know how this movie can have such a big score on iMDb.Don't waste your time with this!"
" Meh
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,5,"The film had some good special effects and an enjoyable dystopian theme, but it was nothing like as good as it's hyped up to be. Much of the dialogue was incomprensible mumbling, especially by McConaughey, and I eventually had to turn the English subtitles on to see what was being said. The biggest issue with the storyline is that nobody would seriously think of evacuating humanity from Earth under the circumstances depicted. Also, the idea that Earth's atmospheric Oxygen level could drop by any appreciable amount is simple unfeasible, no matter how much we screw up our only home's natural resources and climate. And it's not as if those potential new places for people to live had breathable atmosphere anyway - the crew still had to wear spacesuits all the time there didn't they?."
" excellent performance
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,9,The movie is mostly intelligent and emotionally (interpersonal). The plot corresponds to the current state of knowledge of physics. As a sci-fi fan I really liked the second half of the movie.
" One of my all time favorites
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,10,Great in every way. I highly recommend watching the special features too!
" Just watched the movie alone, and literally, when it finished i stud up and claped.
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,10,"This is first time ever that i claped to a movie, and i mean EVER. This is just incredible. There's no other movie as close. It could easily be the best I've ever seen. Just wow...."
" Best

" Unexpected Surprise
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,9,"I had no idea this movie was going to be this good. It took me years to see this movie and I want to say it was because I didn't have the time, but it was really because I thought it wasn't gong to be a great movie. I took a day and decided to watch it and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised, everything about this movie screamed epic from the unimaginable CGI to the emotional acting I felt from Matthew McConaughey which I'm not gonna lie was truly unexpected. When it came to Matthew's acting I always thought it wasn't the best until I sat and watched Interstellar to behold an actor far better than others. If you want to watch a movie that gives you all of feels and able to bend your mine, watch Interstellar."
" I hate it
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,8,"I hate crying, so I hate this movie so much.
Brilliant and very very emotional."
" Very original script, Great Directing, Stunning acting!
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,8,"Wow what a performance from Matthew McConaughey !! Maybe Oscar worthy! A well written original script with this great directing makes viewer's mind to blow! The only bad thing is the music... For me terrible choices for music.... It could have been epic... A plot that wanders in people's minds for decades! Ann and Julia Roberts were a great addition in the cast. I wanted Caine's and Matt Damon's roles a little bit different but ok, watchable!"
" Watching the theory of relativity in stark action
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,10,"It might be that I haven't watched much stuff like this myself, but to my mind this movie teaches the theory of relativity in the most shocking fashion possible.To realise that two people, just because they are at different points in space, will experience time differently will overwhelm you witless. Even more unfathomable is that the way this universe works, these laws of physics, appear to have been created especially for us. Humans are the only entities that can make sense of time - we age, we do things by spending time, we can feel it, and we can totally choose to ignore it while we sleep. Perhaps one day we might really make use of what has meaning only to us.Christopher Nolan is a genius.It is the kind of sci-fi that is heartrending, nerve-wracking, and will move you to tears."

If you don't get it the first time, you'll enjoy just the visuals, the supreme acting of the cast, the music and the story......then go watch it again, and again, and again and again until you feel like you've understood it.

" Incredible
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,9,"Ust saw Interstellar and it was epic tale of humanity's struggle to survive a dying planet. Visually breath-taking, the vastness of space and smallness of man is evident. You feel alone at times but not necessarily afraid. The dialog is near-perfect with but does degrade into sentimentality at times. If only it was as subtle as the humour which was spot on. For whatever reason, I found the movie had a similar vibe at times to Prometheus and the first Star Trek movie. Again, I think that the linkage is the coldness and vastness of space. And the fragility of man. From a science point of view there were pleasing aspects explored such as time dilation which I've never seen treated so openly in film."
" Way Over My Paygrade!
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,5,Couldn't really understand the different parts of the story. Not my kind of movie but I'm sure it appealed to many !

I actually thought the movie was going to be worse than I thought, but woah, that end... I cried a lot in the ending, it was beautifully filmed.
The music is perfect, it's just so beautiful, I listen to it every day and I cry every time I listen to it..
I recommend this film for lovers of drama and science fiction."
" Makes you wonder, what if?
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is filled with emotion, amazing scenes and comes with an excellent soundtrack.It tickles the part of your brain that makes you wonder, what if? What if our technology was advanced enough and we had a key purpose to using it?I don't want to explain it in words because I'll spoil it trying to.Definitely worth a watch."
" Captivating, Intelligent and Emotional
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,10,"I guess one of my greatest regrets now was to not being able to see this in the cinema. I had heard of this film and the hype when it was released. I was 16. My folks bought the DVD when it was available, but I couldn't tell if they loved it or not, so I didn't bother exploring it. However, even if I had watched and paid attention to the film then, sure I would be astonished, but it will never be the same experience as to the way that I'm feeling right now.I am stunned. Dazzled. It's fascinating and it's beautiful that I'm even catching my breath from weeping so much.
Matthew McConaughey's character Cooper, reminded me of my dad. My relationship with him has been through complications due to the fact that I grew up away from him cause of his profession. But I always waited for him to come home, even if it took so many years for him to do so.Now, the tables have turned, and I'm the one who has to go a thousand miles away. I wanna go home, perhaps after a year or two, but who knows though. I just hope they wouldn't forget about me haha.I'm sorry if it has gotten a bit more personal, but on a serious note though, overall, the film has taught me so much; humanity, sacrifice, love, physics, the relevance of time and whatnot. The score was absolutely splendid. The performances were brilliant. The visual effects were breathtaking and literally out-of-this-world haha.I know Interstellar is going to stay with me for a long time, and I'm fine with that. (Update: it still has stayed on my mind, guys haha)"
" MINDBLOWING.
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,10,Wow I cannot believed I waited almost 10 years to watch this movie. All the emotionals I'm telling you!!! Esp the ending when Coop reunited with his daughter... I could not stop crying. This is BY FAR ONE OF THE BEST SCI-FI MOVIES I HAVE EVER WATCHED.

" Okay

" Imaginative, beautiful, and possibly frustrating.
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,9,"""Interstellar"" is a Christopher Nolan movie, which means it stretches the imagination and asks more questions than it answers. If you're okay with that, you'll like it. If you find that frustrating, this will be no different. But it's wonderfully acted, beautifully produced, and excellently written. 9/10"
" All time favorite

" Awful
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,1,"Everything about this movie is so bad, especially the acting.Matthew McConaughey's gruff ""whispering"" is particularly annoying - why do so many lead males nowadays try (and fail) to copy Clint Eastwood? And Michael Caine's ""parody"" of a NASA scientist almost made me laugh out loud.All in all, the film is just Hollywood dross that starts badly then goes downhill from there. Avoid, if you value your time."
" Interesting
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,8,"My first few times viewing this movie I got bored. Even my most recent time I was bored. A lot of intelligent thought was put into it for people who cannot and won't ever understand it, which is basically most of the audience members. But if you pay attention, and become satisfied with zoning in and out, you get something worthwhile. And more emotional than you'd expect.Interstellar is about an earth that has about one generation left before extinction, due to dust storms and lack of farm-worthy land. A man and a group of astronauts are sent into space to a black hole near the planet Jupiter. They are not sure where it goes, but the end result is that it was setup as an entry way to reach habitable planets in the universe. The astronauts land on two of the planets, and many struggles occur. But one sets up shop on the second planet, while the other is found in a hospital recovering from being lost in space for a while.It's a complex storyline, and would take a lot to really explain. The visuals are pretty stunning to watch in theaters. When I watched the black hole scene, I felt something I hadn't ever felt when watching a movie. I felt like I was zapped and pulled through the wormhole. Matthew Mcconaughey did a good job, and so did the rest of the cast. Jessica Chastain really shines, and adds to my liking of her as an actress.But what really fueled the movie was the emotion involved in it. The pride for the lead characters' family and mission. There is a sense that through the infinite amount of nothingness out there, love still remains consistent and unique among humans. The movie also explores the possibilities that absolutely anything is possible by humans. They could live as ""extra-dimensional' beings, and could do things that are beyond man's abilities now. It's universal evolution, to be able to do everything the universe could do and more.It's a fascinating thought, and a kinda well made movie. The boring parts are boring.Watch it.8 stars"
" I literally said to myself: this is a perfect film
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,10,"During the emergency docking scene, I said to myself: ""this movie is perfect"". I couldn't fund a flaw. The story is enthralling and you feel the anxiety of the people who are struggling to survive and help others to do the same thing. There is a gravity to their work and they each show it well.My favorite genre us sci fi. This is plausible scifi, which is my favorite subset of scifi. McConnahey is amazing as usual. The young actress who plays his daughter seems like a break out star who we will def see again.The music is so good I'm learning a guitar transcription of some of the songs on the finger style guitar we site.I've seen Interstellar 7 or 8 times. I'll watch it regularly for years to come. It's a classic of our time much like Inglorious Basterds."

" Many plot-holes but a solid work of sci-fi overall, with some worthy moments
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,8,"First, the good stuff. Black hole and other imagery is top notch accurate, as confirmed last year by real life observations. This is by no means 2001: A Space Odyssey just as Nolan is no Kubrick, but the movie is ambitious and does have strong points. There are a lot of things that make no sense however, first, the nature of the Apocalypse on Earth is completely nonsensical, but on the other side, the oft criticized ending by the scientifically illi terate, makes much more sense than a lot of otherwise blindly accepted parts, especially if you take into account that once you go speculative, you cannot be that wrong. There is some sound strong sci-fi along the way, but a lot of nonsense points have to be given too, though many are saved by the (almost) brilliantly consistent ending, and a lot of sci-fi themes are nicely incorporated and shown, to stimulate imagination in some capable kids.There is also a strong extra point given for respect of the father, as single fatherhood is vastly underappreciated in the wok esick culture of nowaday. The daughter ""scientist"" is celebrated despite of the fact that she entirely plagiarizes work of future generations transmitted by her daddy, which is taken as her modest denial in a culture desperate but unable to obtain wok ef reindly heroines of disciplines for which for many centuries including decades of ins ane positive dis krimination they are proven to be a bit too soft in the head for, a touche, if subtle punch that irritated the ""critics"". Extra point for Matt Damon playing a nas ty man he always seemed to me to be.Overall, a flawed but inspiring piece that can stimulate imagination and scientific curiosity in those who have it, and some emotional roller coaster for the dimw it majority."
" To space and beyond...
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,10,"What can I say about this movie that others already have written...nothing...This is one of a kind , a gift for mankind
Someone once say that a director reach a peak when delivers a science fiction film , like a challenge, because it's a very difficult genre to archive and Nolan not only delivers, he also did so far the best movie of his career if not, one of the best movie ever.
All the big effects, feelings and images : the planets, the ships, the wormhole ,the drama contrasting the small details : the watch, the complicity of Tars at the end , the leap of faith of Anne Hathaway taking the helmet off in front of the grave of Edmund...All of that entwined with the beautiful score of Hans made me add a little grain of sand , a diminutive speck of stardust with this review to a massive, monumental film made with heart and soul."

",2019-11-01 00:00:00,10,This movie is an absolute masterpiece in every sense. Essential viewing if you get the chance. Enough said.
" Excellent film. Casting and writing could have been better in some areas.
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,8,"Strong film! The premise and the conceptual solution were amazing. I did not know what to expect from credit to credit making this film anything but predictable. The science around gravity and time was cool.The few things I did not care for (which are subjective) is they cast Anne Hathaway as a lead scientist, which I could not buy into. The role did not fit her personality IMHO. I did, however, like Jessica Chastain as ""Murph."" I think she was a good pick for the role and played it well. She seemed more authentic as a scientist than Hathaway. I have nothing against Anne Hathaway. I like her. I just feel the role she played would have been a better fit for someone else. Again, this is very subjective, and she did a decent job, not epic.I also did not care for Matt Damon's dialogue (I love almost all of his movies). The writing for his role turned me off. After the revival scene (when he initially wakes up) the rest seemed wooden and inauthentic. I think they should have kept the dialogue short when they were walking on the ice or during the fight versus continuous dialogue. Even after the fight he was still talking about human reaction to blah blah blah. He should have stood silently, possibly showing facial emotions such as guilt or sadness, then walked away. Instead he kept yammering: ""What you are feeling is this human emotion and that human emotion because of this and that."" I just wanted him to shut up and get on with it. His dialogue completely distracted from the scene, versus adding to it. I blame the writers for this. However, the action involving his character was cool and dramatic.Also, I did not care for the way Matthew McConaughey sent the message(s) in the end. How he arrived there to send the message was utterly ridiculous. It seemed like something out of a Peter Pan book for four year olds. Even if you accept the nonsensical way he arrived at the place to send the message, why did he shrink to a size that was shorter than the height of a book??? That made it even more ridiculous. I get the gravity and time parts, I have yet to understand why he shrank in size like Ant Man. That was just plain stupid. I won't even touch the watch thing. That was stupid too.For such a great movie, they should have come up with a more plausible explanation and message delivery system.Beyond these short comings (which are few and short lived), this movie was spectacular!!! The music score was great as it drew me into the moment. The concept and the plot were gripping. These aspects help to offset the shortcomings in this film.This is a must-see movie!!!"
" One of the most special movies of my Life
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is a very deep, confusing but emotional film. The acting of Matheww Mcconaughey and the music is very emotional. The music and the ending lefts you emotional and with a message to save the Earth"

The film is so striking in its special effects that the black hole that appears it's so precise that had become a academic reference! Worth mentioning is also the most realistic wormhole also considering all the spatial dimensions and their supposed effect on anything inside it, just fantastic as well as the consequences of relativity demonstrated in the movie!"

",2019-10-27 00:00:00,8,"Christopher Nolan holds a special place among Hollywood's top billed directors for his unique credo of creating mammoth blockbusters which venture beyond being a slam-bang visual spectacle to engage the viewers' grey matter. After The Dark Knight Rises, the triumphant capping to a glorious Gotham trilogy and nested, nebulous dreamscapes of Inception, with Interstellar, Nolan has set his sight quite literally beyond the visible horizon. As in the case of excellent Inception, Nolan is again fiddling with one of his pet themes of asymmetric time lines across one or more planes. The vastly differing speeds of passage of times between earth and in space, especially close to black holes.
In the not so distant future, the survival of human beings on earth is at peril. Global warming and ecological degradation induced blights have killed most of our food crops and corn is the sole surviving food crop. The human race is on the brink of a near certain extinction through starvation and diseases induced frequent dust storms. The human race is pushed back to pre-industrial agrarian age to sustain life on the planet where schools train students to become food-growers of the future.Cooper (Mathew McConaughey), a widower, former NASA pilot turned forced farmer, lives in rural America with his son Tom, daughter Murph and father-in-law. Murph is an intelligent and curious kid who shares a deep bond with her father. Strange events involving the bookshelf of their home set Cooper and Murph in a journey which leads them to a secret installation which happens to be a near defunct NASA headed by Professor Brand (Michale Caine) and his team including the Professor's daughter, Amelia (Anne Hathaway).Professor Brand states that they are planning to send a team of astronauts on an inter-galactic mission to find new planets suitable for human inhabitation. To this end, the mission would make use of a large wormhole that had appeared mysteriously near Saturn some years ago. Brand urges Cooper to be the pilot of this mission as the other members have no flying experience outside a simulator. Cooper accepts the offer much to the chagrin of Murph who believes that this is dangerous and could well be an one-way journey. Nevertheless, Cooper sets out on this daredevil mission after making a solemn promise to Murph to return from the mission, no matter what the circumstances.It is also revealed that NASA under Professor Brand has been working on utilizing the mysterious wormhole for several years to find new inhabitable planets in far away galaxies to replace the earth which is withering in a wasting dust bowl. They have already sent several manned probes - called Lazarus missions - through the said wormhole and three of them such probes have been transmitting some basic signals indicating potential destinations which could hold promise for humanity. Brand wants Cooper to lead a mission through the wormhole to explore these three planets for possibilities of human sustenance. Meanwhile, Brand is also working on earth in solving an equation which could help escape earth's gravity and enable a larger mission to transport humans from earth to a planet to be located by Cooper and his team. If the transport of humans at such a large scale to the new planet, which is Plan A, fails to succeed, Brand has devised a Plan B which involves creating a new settlement on the new planet from a collection of fertilized embryos being transported along with Cooper and his team.Cooper's team includes Amelia Brand, physicist Romilly, geographer Doyle, and two multi-purpose artificially intelligent robots- CASE and TARS. Their long mission involves an initial docking with a rotating space station Endurance which would, in turn, carry them on a two year long trip to Saturn in hypersleep mode. Thereafter, they traverse through the wormhole to reach a distant galaxy where they find that the three planets to be explored by them - Miller, Mann & Edmunds (named after the pilots who had flown on the initial Lazarus missions and reached those planets) - are orbiting around a super massive black hole called Gargantua.The intense gravity of the black hole distorts space time in such a way that one hour in a planet orbiting near the black hole could be the equivalent of seven years in the earth time. This poses an additional constraint of time on Cooper's team over and above the limitation of fuel to explore these planets and return to earth before the human race embraces a painful extinction through starvation. While Cooper and team are busy on their mission which skews their time line, several decades pass on earth, where we find that the now grown up Murph (Jessica Chastain), a brilliant astrophysicist, is assisting Professor Brand in solving the equation while Tom (Casey Affleck) is struggling to sustain the farm and save his family.What happens to Cooper and his team as they set out to explore these three planets ? Could they explore all the three planets ? Could they identify a planet hospitable to human sustenance ? Did Professor Brand solve the equation that could help him operationalise Plan A ? Could Cooper keep his promise to Murph ? Could Cooper's team find the planet in time to save the human race from extinction ? How did the worm hole near Saturn come about in the first place ? Who had put it there ? An technologically advanced race of aliens ? Or super-evolved humans ? Why would such an advanced race want to help us in the first place ? The movie answers most of these questions through a narrative spanning across galaxies while raising several others as we walk out of the movie hall. Remember, the scene in Inception where a whole city folds in half over itself.. Suffice to say that the Nolans have written Interstellar in manner quite similar to Inception's city such that the entire movie folds over itself as it proceeds to its conclusion.This is a movie which engages, nay, demands the viewer's undivided attention to understand the proceedings on screen. In fact, it would help a great deal if we go prepared with some basic understanding about stuff like black holes, worm holes and time travel (Click here for a quick primer from Stephen Hawkings himself).The movie checks several key elements which we have come to identify as a Nolan template - be it dealing in wildly ambitious themes dealing with cerebral &/or psychological conflicts, exceptional set pieces, movies which kindle several questions which linger on long after viewing and which requires repeat viewings & further reading for better understanding and above all movies which are superlatively entertaining. While it is true that the movie deals with dense and theoretical concepts in physics, it is to the credit of Nolan that he renders most of these accessible within a narrative which results in a momentous movie that stretches the horizons of a Hollywood blockbuster. Yet, at its very core, this is a very human drama involving the emotional bond between a daughter and her doting father which places love as a force which transcends all dimensions -hitherto known and unknown. While a drama like this can be set in any period or geography, Nolan, true to his penchant, has chosen to stage this on an interstellar scale, in a very literal sense.While not a very challenging role in the league of Dallas Buyers Club, Academy Award winner McConaughey sparkles in the role of Cooper and is effective especially in his scenes as a vulnerable and emotionally conflicted father. But, it is Mackenzie Foy who plays the young Murph whose performance which tops the charts among a cast which includes such renowned performers as regular Nolan collaborator Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain and Anne Hathaway among others. While Hans Zimmer's score puts the galactic proceedings on an overdrive with a thumping score, Hoyt Van Hoytema, who has handled the camera in the absence of Nolan regular Wally Pfister, captures the action in space in visuals which are simply overwhelming.Interstellar does not trump the towering 2001 - A Space Odyssey, which remains the definitive touchstone for a space movie. Yet, Nolan's movie, despite its calculated cinematic liberties, succeeds in bridging the narrative of a Hollywood blockbuster to cutting edge concepts in space science (thanks to his collaboration with renowned astrophysicist Kip Thorne), which are accessible to the commons. And, while it may, on the surface, appear to be a sensational sci-fi flick set in space packed with resplendent visuals and set-pieces, Nolan has suffused its core with the power of love and bonding in what could well be his most heartfelt movie till date."
" Movie for Scientist!
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,3,It's definately a masterpiece for related scientists but for general audience it's too complicated and some what inunderstandable! So for me it's just a brilliant movie for scientists & theorist!
" My all-time fave
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,10,"Allllllriiiiight. That's what most of us think of when we think of Matthew McConaughey. But this movie, as well as many other he has done as of late (Dallas Buyer's Club, Mud, and others) is proof that McConaughey is an acting stud. And he is in his prime in this one.So what do you get when you had McConaughey in his prime, the lovely Anne Hathaway, an amazing Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine...Casey Affleck... Topher Grace...Wes Bentley... John Lithgow...David Gyasi... and oh yeah, MATT DAMONNNNN, to a Christopher & Johnathan Nolan original sci-fi script?Watch and find out. In addition to all of the obvious, top-notch quality already listed, this movie bleeds emotion. When the thought of watching a movie a subsequent time literally makes your heart race, eyes tear up, and gives you goosebumps, that is emotion. I enjoy everything about this film, despite the arguments against it, which are nothing more than it being too ambitious. Why? Because it is so brilliant and beautiful that I cannot quite put into words what is being conveyed. They say the best art should always leave you with a sense of curiosity, some questions and an excitable anxiousness. You will finish this film feeling all of the above and then some. It is much more than Alllllllllriiiiiiiiight."
" BEST

",2019-10-25 00:00:00,2,"... mainstream popcorn movie.
Not even good acted.
I quite enjoyed the first hour, but then it just got boring as (you know what I mean) and ridiculous in the end.
These things happen to me often when I try to catch up with hyped movies like this. I should trust my instincts...
Sometimes I question humanity..."
" Really?
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,5,"Chris Nolan is better than this. This is some JJ Abrams' ""Lost""-type nonsense. Put out a bunch of stuff and only answer some of it, leaving a bunch of unresolved plot holes and loose ends. Not good storytelling."

" Best movie i have seen so far
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,10,"My favourite movie so far.Everything in this movie is perfect. I think that the essential element of this masterpiece is the music. Never again a music will match so well with a movie.

",2019-10-17 00:00:00,9,"Christopher Nolan and Jhonatan Nolan give us Interstellar as one of the best films ever made in history and their careers.For both the drama of its script, the laudable performance of the movie's actors - worth mentioning Matthew McConaughey's touching and moving performance - breathtaking special effects at various times in the film - especially on the first planet explored - and the advanced physics it is. explained in a simplistic way to the public by activating everyone's understanding without being lost.These extraordinary combinations make the movie loved and remembered as the best space movie ever made."
" A Masterpiece
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,9,"There's something about the way this movie actually seems to take you along on this ""Interstellar journey"", that is like no other. I must attribute this to the director, C.Nolan. I first saw it at my home, later in the evening. And after it was over, and the discussion about it was over. I crawled into bed, and thought, ""wow, it's so good to be home"". Like I had been up there, on the journey in the movie, too. I have never had that reaction from a movie before (or since)."
" Best sci-fi movie ever

I'm writing it after seeing this movie for the third time and I feel that I'm ready to say that this it the best sci-fi movie of all time.If cinema is to be included among the arts, then this is a timeless masterpiece to cherish and Nolan is the Michelangelo of this industry. Yes.... I like this movie quite a lot...."

Some critics did not like it. Like some others would say: ""ignore them"". And if you are a parent, then you'll be even more emotional."
" Greatest Movie Ever
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,10,This movie blessed my soul. I've watched it atleast 10 times.
" ""Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here.""
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,8,This is one sensational masterpiece from Christopher Nolan one of the best movies in this decade. It's emotional and inspirational. The climax gets bit clumsy and confuses a little bit but if you careful watch it and think it's not a big deal.
" A great journey through your mind
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,10,"Christopher Nolan did it again. One of the most beautiful sci-fi movies ever, which will not leave you cold. This story is about eternal things such as love, devotion, self-realization, about our potential future, about things, which people are ready to sacrifice to salvage all the humanity. How people can kill humaneness in themselves in order to save mankind.The movie contains not only breathtaking action scenes and very deep thoughts, but also heartbreaking moments, that will make you cry.So, if you haven't seen this movie for some reason, that's your homework for this evening.""Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day.
Rage, rage against the dying of the light."""
" Excellent film!
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,10,"Stellar casting, great story which had me on the edge of my seat more 5han once. Great entertainment ! I highly recommend any sci-fi buff to see it."
" A movie to question our existence
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,9,"A film that gives us proposals about our purpose as humans, about the concept of time and space, and about the most intimate places inside the human being, is like going outside inside. Nolan did it again..."
" Really?
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,3,"How does this garbage have 8.6 rating from users? If you guys are getting paid to put 9 or 10 star reviews please tell me where to sign up. That's the only way this thing could've gotten anything higher then 4 star at best! It was such a boring, slow, confusing trash pile. I'm a fan of Christopher Nolan but dude messed up! That being said, every fumbles here and there and I'm not gonna boycott his films or burn the ones I have but be warned If you are a fan of his work. The only reason I gave 3 stars instead of 0 is because it does have some great ideas and was beautifully shot. But sadly this isn't enough to save the film. If you have to watch this movie turn the sound off and put on some music. It will be much better"
" Put aside the science fiction this is an awesome love story of a father to his children
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,9,"Although this movie is a high end sci-fi production the best part about it is the story and the relationship between the father and his children and specially with his daughter. As a father to children of my own I couldn't keep my eyes dry in last part of the film. The acting in the film is fantastic and although the science fiction stuff is far from being reliable the story overcomes any unrealistic detail (which there are plenty of). Bottom line, fantastic movie. Great acting. 9/10 stars from me."
" Sets the bar way too high for next Sci-fi space movies
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,10,"Mindblowing picture. One thing that stands out for me is Chastain's delivery on crucial scenes, it moves me and it's extraordinary powerful alongside with Nolan's storytelling and vision. It's a brilliant masterpiece of a movie, and Hans Zimmer did an outstanding work with the soundtrack, mesmerizing to say the list."
" A masterpiece with flaws that doesn't age well
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,6,"While the story and the visuals are outstanding, at the third or fourth view I can better understand the flaws that I noticed from the start. After all, the plot is quite simple, and the dialogues are irritantingly obvious and full of exposition. So, once you get accustomed to the wow-moments, little remains aside some very good eye-candy. Nolan is clearly the most overvalued director of this time. He's a visionary, but not a good writer or director. At the end of the day, Interstellar is a masterpiece in his concept and will forever retain an history-making value, but it's not that good cinematographically speaking. 6.5 stars."
" A great film
",2019-10-09 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar gives a relatively simple idea (the future of the earth) a new story, by trying to move the human race (or ensure its survival) on a new planet. The story makes many twists and turns which I won't spoil, each character has understandable motives, but they try to achieve them in less than ethical ways. The Stunning visual effects combined with an epic score, and characters portrayed by great actors/actresses, I highly recommend interstellar to anyone wanting to see a great film."
" Sci-Fi in its most purest and effective form
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,9,"This film is a masterpiece. Christopher Nolan is fast becoming one of the best directors around (The Dark Knight, Inception). He also seems to do his best work with a Hans Zimmer score. (Dark Knight and Inception, amongst many)There so many stand out moments it would be wrong to even go into them. All I will say is, if this film does resonate with you on some kind of level by the end, you better check you still have a pulse.Watch on a big screen, turn up the 5.1 and enjoy the greatest science fiction film ever made."
" Awesome is not enough for this movie
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,10,"This movie should be one of the best movie of all time, it should be 9.9/10 because it so, so, so, so, so, so much freaking awesome, and I really like to explore universe more thanks to this movie
Universe so scary but also make people so curious, we could travel to another world, another galaxies, another universe, maybe even we could live thousand years, million years or billion years old, sounds like crazy but universe is crazy and it beyond what we could imagine"
" Mankind Achievement

" Excellent score and sound design.

" Brilliant, elegant, thought provoking Magnum Opus
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,10,"By this point, Christopher Nolan became synonymous with thought provoking films l...and adding to his well established filmography is this brilliant magnum opus... beautifully concieved by the minds of Chris Nolan, his brother Jonathan Nolan and astrophysicist Kip Thorne, the science portrayed in this film (by this time proven to be plausible) along with the father daughter relationship combines to form a visual spectacle unlike any other... Highly recommend to watch it..."
" One of the best Nolan¬¥s movies
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,7,"Christopher Nolan is one of those directors who do not see each day, is known and respected for the trilogy of the knight of the night and for telling his stories in different chronological order. Interstellar was a film acclaimed both by critics and by the audience, it could be said that these were the main reasons why I wanted to see it, apart from Matthew McConaughey being the protagonist. The movie has a good start, because you understand who is who and what you need to know about the main characters. The performances are as always in the excellent Nolan movies, the comrade movements seemed good to me, the environment I loved because it is not fictional, you think that what you are seeing is real. The script is great in the sense that you can understand that Nolan made him want since he even bothered to ask a professional in Astronomy to help write the script. The plot may sound something simple but it is really very complex, it would be that the characters have to find a habitable approach to save humanity from extinction, if that sounds very simple, but it is not because there is more like that mission itself was a farce and the human relationships of the characters. The relationships of the characters feel real, the movie made me feel how the characters felt, it is very emotional to see how Cooper takes his time to decide whether to go to the mission to save humanity or stay with his children in the earth, for example when Cooper is taking the mission and his daughter tries to reach him desperately, you manage to feel the sadness that the characters feel at that moment, and that is something that not many films achieve, if their realization with Murph is quite complex, you could say that the main theme of the film is love, everything is done for love, in fact you could say that love is what saves humanity, the connection between Murph and Cooper is so strong that it helps Murph to save the humanity from extinction. But no matter how emotional it is, Nolan did not make a perfect movie, since in itself, it makes no sense that a secret government organization hires a subject who has not seen in years for such an important mission, and when the characters go to the water planet and one of the characters stays on the ship, I understand that the hours spent there were 20 years on earth and on the ship, therefore I have to ask myself questions like: How the hell did that guy survive 20 years on the ship alone without losing his sanity, entertaining himself and not resorting to suicide? Did they have provisions for 20 years? Wow, that guy really deserves all my respect, for surviving that, and the truth is that something that surprised me about Nolan was that, it was very obvious those who were going to die and those who were going to live, I say they surprised me because Nolan He is a respected director for not making mediocre mistakes, if he may make mistakes in his movies, but not as mediocre and repetitive as that. In conclusion Interstellar is a film that I personally liked very much, with good performances, an interesting environment, a good direction, characters with personality, but with things that have weight for plot, which are the opposite of reality, this movie It deserves a 7/10 but I will make an exception, for the good attitudes, for the complexity of the protagonists, because Nolan took the trouble to ask for help from a professional for the script and because I am very entertained, it is because that this movie for me is an 8/10."
" The best sci-fi movie of all time!!!!
",2019-10-04 00:00:00,10,"WHAT AN EXPERIENCE. Interstellar is one of those movies which keeps you captivated from the very beginning. The emotion in this movie is too damn high. And the score is just on another level. Matthew's performance is just amazing, the scene where he sees Murph's video messages is an example of what a great actor he is. Christopher Nolan, you genius."
" Everyone who rated this good fell into a wormhole
",2019-10-04 00:00:00,2,"Cons
Science babble, forcing me to pause and question and clarify several times: some theories are based on our current understanding of physics and astronomy, and others are just stupid.There's one scene where there's dust all over the house, but nowhere along the fields when they're driving throughTime-space warping wormhole but their spaceship is intact, they suffer no physical/psychological changesn-th dimension, and you end up behind the bookshelf in your old house??the whole ""love"" things was just cheesythey'd sent several ships prior, and then this one, but then no others in the interim years?it takes lightyears to get anywhere, yet they cross the blackhole in a matter of minutesMatthew McConaughey needs to learn diction!"
" One the movies you must see before die
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,10,"If you almost know nothing about space or stars,don't worry. For two reason:
1_this movie explains everything about them and describe what they are.
2_Interstellar doesn't only based on spatial,stars,blackholes,wormholes and the milkway. It actually based on romance and drama genre. It demonstrates distressing relationship between a father and his daughter.
There are some astronauts who want save the world and figure out a new planet for living.
Timeline,story,directing and specially it's music is strength of this movie. As i did , you probably go back and watch it again to discover what happened in the last part of it.
Good luck and definitely see."
" Another Nolan masterpiece!
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,9,"I love Nolan's films and this is another of his bangers. As movies like Inception and the Batman Trilogy this movie has a good plot, good acting and the music is on point.Even tho i could've wished a little more emotional punch in the end of the movie.A thing that i think adds a lot to this movie is all the plot twists you see through the film and in my opinion thats a plus you don't see in every movie.Definitely a movie to watch, it will not disappoint you."
" A new age cinematic masterpiece
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,9,"After realizing the severity of Earth's critical condition, a team of scientists, explorers, and pioneers rush through space on an expedition to find an inhabitable planet.Christopher Nolan's imagination and ideas come in handfuls with this magical, intense, sci-fi rollercoaster. This is a new-age Odyssey, and if that isn't reason enough to see this film than I don't know what is. Everything needed in a breathtaking film is displayed throughout 169 minutes and takes cinema to a new level. Firstly, the soundtrack is phenomenal. Hans Zimmer is of course brilliant in this film and his work matches the film in every way, only adding to the experiences and emotions. As the film deepens and intensifies, so does Hans' score and as the movie ends, we hear the tense yet hopeful melody that the film has been building up to. Even more sullen and dark moments have Hans Zimmer all over them with darkening tones. Next is Nolan's visual effects. This film has beautiful scenes and cinematography that encompasses the entire film. Hoyte Van Hoytema, the director of cinematography, is a master and his work on this film is incredible. His work can be seen in other notable films, such as Her (2013), Ad Astra (2019), and Dunkirk (2017). And of course, the direction. Nolan shows some of his best work in this film, showing the perfect angles and knowing exactly where to cut to each character and scene to match Hans Zimmer's astonishing scores.A prominent theme in this movie is gravity, not only scientifically, but metaphorically too, such as the gravity the characters feel, and the gravity we feel along with them through the direction of the film, and incredible acting. Matthew McConaughey does exceptional work here, along with supporting actress Anne Hathaway, who's chemistry in this film are both amazing and believable. I can't imagine the main character being anyone else other than Matthew McConaughey, seeing as he himself was basically the entire movie. His performance was incredibly moving and heartfelt, I felt like I could feel his every thought and emotion.The film's plot in itself is a confusing one, where questions are raised, then answered, and raise more questions. This is meticulously designed by Nolan, as his films typically are. However, one thing is clear, so to speak. This is that love is a strong force in our universe, as is gravity. Like, gravity, love will gravitate us towards those we love. Love is not itself something we can explain or comprehend, and it being a driving force for us is unexplainable, yet incredibly powerful. Such as Brand felt her move stretch across galaxies for her fellow scientist and explorer, our love for the ones we truly do love will stretch as far as possible and grows as the distance between them grows as well.Some of this film will remain a mystery, as will the fate and future of humanity, but like with the mystery of love, and how it will grow and stretch no matter the distance, humanity will remain ever expanding and searching for its next place in the universe, physically and symbolically."

" I got the message they were trying to convey about gravity and time and mankind and love
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,5,"The first time I watched this I could not wait for it to be over, Thought it was the dumbest thing I'd ever seen. Full of plot holes, recycled sci-fi ideas and just plain ridiculousness. The cast is pretty great but I had heard this was meant to be one of those game changer movies, an ""epic sci-fi.? Not so much.Well I caught it on TV yesterday and while I still found weird, lazy story flaws and things that didn't make much sense, I didn't hate it. I got the message they were trying to convey about gravity and time and mankind and love. I finally (somewhat) understood all the positive reviews out there although if you check here there are just as many bad onesInterstellar follows former astronaut, now farmer Mathew McConaughey and his family at some future point on earth when the atmosphere has become inhospitable to human life. McConaughey stumbles upon a sort of NASA headquarters in the back of one of the cornfields and soon embarks on a dangerous mission with Ann Hathaway through a wormhole in order to find a hospitable planet, oh and some time passes.Some of my issues; NASA is in exile right next door to the farm, how convenient, they're living in a dustbowl but only when it suits the filming schedule otherwise its cornfields, sunshine and chasing drones. McConaughey -who is a galaxy and a wormhole away- shows up in his daughters childhood bedroom 40 years later. WTH. Mind blown. Even the earlier ghosting doesn't really explain this bit of mind screwery."
" I have no words
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,10,"I first saw Interstellar when i was 14. I did'nt have a clue what i was watching . Fast forward to 2018 I watched it and kinda liked it , yet i could only make up some of it . So , I started watching it again & again & again till I had no idea that I had already seen it 14 times consectively . It all makes sense now . This film is one of the most scientifically acurate
( tho science fiction ) and enough to bring a person to tears. I can't really put into words how much this movieeans to me."
" What a film!!!
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,10,"Great writing, acting and directing.
Still can stir my emotions."
" G. O. A. T.
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,10,"Missing Interstellar in theaters is the biggest regret of my life. Classic is a small word to describe this everlasting cult. If I went to tesseract the first thing I do is to make myself experiencing Interstellar (2014) in theaters.
Dear moviebuffs, please don't miss this once in a lifetime experience, watch it without break and volume at maximum. And then thank Mr. Nolan and the whole cast & crew for their priceless work."
" Brutally saddening yet wonderful
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,10,"The best movies make you feel something. What this movie did to me was crazy. It made me feel love, hate, hope, sadness, all at the same time. A true masterpiece."
" Visually stunning endeavour but...
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,6,"An admiration of Nolan's beautiful practical effects over computer generated is commendable.Am a fan of most of his work, but this failed to hit home for me. The seemingly arduous runtime accompanied by Han Zimmer's tense score drowning out the dialogue at times; with McConaughey portraying (a somewhat?) plausible scientist, made this quite vexing to view.Again, this a visually stunning film, which makes up for most of this but fails to connect with myself personally. Many of the concepts and theories are of interest, but they are executed with an air of pretension that can't be avoided."
" Waste of time.
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,1,"This is the worst film I have ever seen. Not even Michael Caine could redeem this garbage. As soon as Anne Hathaway's *scientist* character hypothesizes to the other *scientists,* ""But what if it's LOVE?!"" I was ready to walk out the door. It's like the Nolans thought, ""I know, let's make a lady scientist! But wait, she has to make poor choices because of a man so she's relatable!"" I was cheering for the dust by the end of this film."
" Best Sci fi movie ever
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,10,"This movie has everything, from action to heart break. Although it's a movie mainly based out of this world, it still manages to connect with our core emotions and takes us on a ride through our galaxy like no other movie has done before. And the soundtrack, wow, Hans Zimmer delivers to the masses with yet another score for what I believe is the best soundtrack in the last decade"
" Are u kidding me?.
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,1,"Not scientifically accurate ... ( not how wormholes / black holes function.)
but the third act has some interesting visuals . But this movie is overlong and overrated . Nothing on Kubrick.
Its a stretch but some parts are still enjoyable.
This could have been much more .
More could have been explained with what happened to the ecosystem ... what about the the change of mental state through epochs ?. That alone could be a interesting movie ...
hawkings talks about ideas that should be in movies but haven't been implemented. ... Yet!.Like inception this movie deludes the audience with tantalizing concepts not fully conceptualized...
but could be a spring board for future film makers ...
sometimes i am let down by movies that promise too much . Some 13 year old is gonna think they have just had a quantum physics lecture ... ( sorry if i sound too harsh.) ...its less context and more deconstructed simulacra ..."
" Really bad movie in my opinion.
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,2,"Totally unrealistic ideas.
Looking through a wormhole near Saturn to see other galaxies.
Sheer nonsense.
Casting Matthew McConaughey as a scientist give me a break. He is a terrible actor. Should stick to car commercials.
And the walking refrigerator jeesh, really stupid.
Bad movie."
" Not One, But The Best Science Fiction Ever
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,10,"Brilliant, riveting, genius all that together blended and boom produce this movie. A balance between science with a little bit of emotional drama, telling the story of how can we save humanity by against all impossible or beyond obstacles like the family love, the time, the wormhole, the space to find a resource from another universe. Abrilliant performance from matthew and all other casts, making this movie more entertaint and awing us more. Thanks a lot to christopher nolan for making this masterpiece."
" Nothing short of excellence
",2019-09-16 00:00:00,10,"I have watched this movie 8 times, and it continues to mesmerize me. Movie critics that say this movie lacks emotions are senseless people with a spoiled mind. Nolan's masterpiece will remain the best all time movie in my opinion."
" Unforgettable movie
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,10,"Favorite movie of my life. Watched more then 5 times to understand the movie better. Watched so many documentaries about five dimensions , black holes etc. I'm hoping for part 2"
" Interesting but long and confusing
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,6,"It's not a bad movie but it's also not as amazing as people say it is. The cast is great, the story is interesting but it's just too long and complicated. The more I think about it, the more confused I'm. Maybe it's me, maybe I just didn't get it but I don't think this movie makes a lot of sense. I also didn't like the ending. All throughout the movie we want to see the reunion between the father and the daughter and in the end it's something between weird and sad. If you're crazy for sci-fi movies, give it a try. If not, I'd probably skip it."
" Magic!
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie right here, this is the BOMB!!! Everything with this movie is just perfect. Not only is it sci-fi, but it is excellent in every way. It gives you a wonderful feeling."
" Honest opinion
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,10,"I have watched this film 3 times. Each time i discover something new. Not only about the story itself , but it also taught me alot about me and my life.
If you watch this film , you will learn a alot abot our earth, solar system, other planets and other galaxies.
Watch this , the cast is amazing, the visual effects and the music, THE MUSIC makes me wanna work for NASA.Nolan is a real deal"
" Outstanding
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,10,Best movies after inception I will never seen this type in Hollywood
" great
",2019-09-11 00:00:00,9,"Great story, sad ending. Definitely worth a watch. Great acting as well."
" Doesn't matter how many viewings, always hits hard.
",2019-09-10 00:00:00,10,Its a slow burner but it's a beautiful tale... one that gets better on repeat viewings. The ending hits me every time. Hard.
" Best movie ever

" Amazing!
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,10,This was a great movie and one that I wish there were more of. This movie had me thinking the whole time and that is what I loved. The balance between entertainment and brain shaking moments was perfect and is a film like no other. Great job to everyone who put this masterpiece together!
" Astonishing
",2019-09-06 00:00:00,10,"This movie keeps improving every time you watch it! First i watch it i dont like it very much (7), second time i love it (9), now, in this third time, omfg, this movie rises to one of the best movies i have ever seen (a glorious10). Christopher Nolan trully is the best filmmaker alive. I LOVE THIS MOVIE, it is very emotional, the story keeps revealing kee points every time you watch it, Hans Zimmer best score work since The Lion King, with this incredible soundtrack that you will want to hear again and again. WOW. A trully masterpiece that already is a classic of the cinema!
Cant wait to see Tenet, new Nolan movie in IMAX"
" Amazing space opera
",2019-09-05 00:00:00,10,"Ok, it's basically an intellectual movie. You need to be willing to feel passion about the physics and astrophysics. The way Nolan puts together the concepts from Kip Thorne and the 5th dimension, time relativity, etc, is fascinating. Of course, i repeat, you need to be willing to hear the whole movie several times, about this main concepts. The photography is perfect, the music is perfect."
" 10/10 an epic masterpiece
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,10,"You Will not be disappointed at all.
I couldn't not fault this movie üé• i saw it the first time and it was abit hard to understand but i wanted to re watch it to get everything and it was so worth it. And for that i can say it's number 1# on my list."
" Masterpiece üëå
",2019-09-03 00:00:00,10,"Masterpiece.......
Legend Christopher Nolan love you"
" A stunning emotional journey through space and time
",2019-09-03 00:00:00,9,"There are several movies that you can relate to and make you feel full of emotions and nostalgia, especially if the timing is the appropriate one. This is one of them. It's totally indifferent if it sticks to scientific facts, what we can call as ""pure cinema""."
" Sorry, I don't want to swim against the current, but...
",2019-09-03 00:00:00,4,"I've been given a hard and long thought about this and I created an IMDB account just for this review. I always enjoyed reading comments and interested in other people's opinions, but this time I feel I just saw a different movie than everybody. I feel that 8.6 mark (at the time of writing this) I highly exagerated in my opinion and I mostly see 10 marks on the first pages of reviews I read. I hate to be one of those people who criticize just for the sake of it, but I don't understand, I simply don't, how this movie, full of cliches and cheesy remarks, made especially for box office, gets so high marks. First of all, it just doesn't make any sense at all to me. In nearly three hours long (way too long for a movie anyway), every ten minutes characters switch their view, they say they finally know and understand the whole thing, the purpose, the way things are going, just to completely change their mind and view ten minutes after. And this is going on for the whole movie. Second, the cheesy talk and cliches of characters, classic jokes you see in each Hollywood movie, cool guy attitude of Matthew McConaughey, southern ""yee-haws"" that don't fit into a SF movie and, in general, situations that will NEVER arise in real life. I can pause the movie every line of dialogue and question a lot of things about why this and that and not this, because the whole scenario and script doesn't make sense. I am not a total moron, I am a college graduate, I like to believe I understand things, but this movie just doesn't make sense at all to me. Too many improbable and/or impossible things in it, too many ""cool"" smiles and smurks at the camera from the main characters and simply too many scenes that don't add put together. I could write against pretty much every scene, but that would take forever and English isn't my first languate, I apologize for any mistakes and/or errors in explaing myself. Effects are ok, music is ok, but everything else just fell short in my view. Sorry, don't want to spoil or troll, I just need to give my impression."
" Breathtaking
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,10,Everything in this movie leaves me speechless the great job Hans Zimmerman did one the soundtrack as always of course makes you watch and doesn't let you move since it's so so incredible it is unbelievable i have watched it probably 4-5 times no matter that is almost 3 hours long . Such masterpiece movies have to be watched definitely hands down the best movie i have ever watched i love it and i will never stop loving this incredible work of art !
" Masterpiece
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,10,"This film is a masterpiece because several geniuses contributed. First, the writing (Chris + brother Jonathan) is astonishing, allowing us to see the motivations, fears, pain felt by each character, especially Murphy in three age periods, which hits an older audience esp hard. Being reconciled after a lifetime of loss was a holy moment for both Murph and Cooper.
Seeing the effects of ""ghost Cooper"" taught many viewers a quick lesson in causality, which is mysterious, even supernatural. Cooper's decision to go or stay with great loss either way? An impossible decision. A lie convinced him to go.
The music by Hanz Zimmer, performed in a cathedral on a giant pipe organ, a work of genius.
Cinematography by Hoyte Van Hoytema, with the vast crop fields, alien planet vistas, cloudscapes, beyond beautiful.
Editing by Lee Smith, which is underrated; editing can break a film.
These people are geniuses and every role is a stroke on this masterpiece.
It hits me so hard every time I watch that I can only manage this film about once a year (I have daughters who were the age of Murph when it came out and I don't get to see them very often).
I reserve 10 stars only for the rarest of films."
" Think big, they say
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,10,"This incredible and at some points really nuts story tries to tell us that love, as gravity, transcends time and space. Because we are attracted towards people and things we love and go further and further apart from people or things we don't love... The story has a very deep message and it was a delight to sink into it again today. The first time I ever saw it I felt asleep :)"
" Splendid movie
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,10,"I watched it 7 or 8 times I guess, and I cried my eyes out each and every time. That gorgeous and full of emotion it is. I guess it s my favorite movie of all time.."
" Brilliant sci fi thriller
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,8,"Matthew McConaughey is brilliant in this flick about a team of astronauts trying to save the human race from extinction. But obstacles also present in the form of narcissists willing to do anything to grab the glory of rescuing humanity. This stars Matt Damon in an unexpected role - in which he (again) excels. Anne Hathaway is the lead supporting, as well as Michael Caine and John Lithgow. David Gyasi is excellent as one of the astronauts. This is a nicely cast, beautifully acted flick with an amazing score, and especially fantastic on a big screen. There are logic flaws but they may be forgiven in light of the other perfections. Well worth your time and money."
" My Review!
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,9,"Please please please DO watch this movie. I really wish to say more but if I gave away even a single hint accidentally, you would kill me!Peace Out!"
" Nolan's Space-Time Masterpiece
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,9,"Christopher Nolan is probably one of the best story tellers/director in today' world. His movies are deep, thought-provoking and are very close to masterpieces.With Interstellar, Nolan does a wonderful job and leaves the audience confused about the concept of 'space-time' continuum."
" One of the best movies ive ever seen!
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,10,"This film is soooo good. One of the best films ive ever seen. It keeps me woundering whats next the whole film. Just mindblowing.
Love the way that everything is connected.
All the time the mankind is in a thin thread. And the ending is great. We live!
10/10 easy! Wow!"
" Best movie about love
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,10,"I have a long story of watching interstellar. I used to watch it with my father and we identified with the connection there was between father and daughter. My father has lost his life in an accident caused by gravity, after a fall. Each time a watch it now, i give it a further meaning that love goes beyond life and death. Death might well be an interstellar journey. This whole movie is a declaration of love towards the human soul and consciousness. The portrayal of the characters is so deep and natural. The movie is outstandingly beautiful and the music divine. I am now watching it very often with my boyfriend, it is his favourite movie as well. This movie is so close to the true essence of life, telling the story using an amazing setting of space travel. This is the best movie ever made so far in my oppinion."
" Waste of time!
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,1,"The most boring movie I've ever seen. The plot really doesn't make sense if you think about it for five seconds, and the human drama is poorly written and unconvincing. Overrated is an understatement."
" Super disappointed
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,3,"This was called CONTACT starring Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey.Not sure, but Nolan has a knack for not so great story telling, with the exception of Dark Knight. Again, movie starts and you don't find out when and where you are. Random interviews with random people talking about the past but again you don't know who they are. Frustrating.Second, the cast was bad and so was the acting. Hathaway as a NASA scientists? Come on. The cliche old wise man played by Michel Caine, we've seen it a million times. It was the general woke cast, a woman, a black guy, two white dudes. The voice of the robot is unbelievably annoying.It is so poorly written and explained. The expositions were lazy and tired old ""speeches"" giving us information.Just a little bit of a drive away from Joseph Cooper is a secret space station he happens to stumble upon after some ""miracle"" dust gathering in his house gives him the signal and of course, once he arrives, they want him to pilot the space ship, because ""he is the only one that can."" LOL Is this real life? Holy crap, it's written by a 13 year old.Of course there are worm holes too... it all so nice and cozy package together.This movie could have just started with a brief montage of earth being desolate and food scarce and then start the mission. They wasted an hour of nonsense.And when you land on a foreign planet you've never been to, you rush out of your spaceship without any worries.A dad that doesn't even care about his daughter. Self-indulgent drivel. But for the mass they will feel it's intellectual master piece. There is too much of the emperor has no clothes."
" Good SciFi thoughtful
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,8,"While overall this movie is thought provoking about survival of the human race, from a technical standpoint this movie is about 1/2 hour too long, and the music soundtrack is overbearing at times and makes spoken dialogue difficult to understand."
" Awesome
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,9,"I thought this movie was great, anything with matthew mcconaughey is great! alright alright alright!"
" Great sci-fi, greatly staged
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,10,"In short words, ""Interstellar"" is the best sci-fi movie I have seen in my life. Period. It deals with the most important issues of human life: love, survival, loyalty, honesty...
Some of the science presented is based only in theories and some ideas happening at the grand finale are still confusing (I am trained in science, but by no means am I a theoretical physicist) but at that moment the viewer is longing for that to happen.
Of course, it is fiction, wonderfully staged."
" Great movie creative
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,9,"Well written well acted very creative, this could actually be our future. Not sure how it was nominated for musical score Oscar?? Many scenes have an annoying soundtrack that caused me anxiety the second time I watch this movie. Very interesting concept."
" VERY RIVETING and MOSTLY THOUGHTFULLY DONE
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,8,I have noted many reviewers have given this a 10 rating while some of the 2 hrs 50 mins of the film warrant that NOT all of the time frame does because as i stated while it is riveting and suspenseful it is also only FAIR in continuity** thus requires one to make sure before they start the film that they are 100% ready UNLESS they can rewind on demand or restart it or just don't care either way because of this i could only warrant a 8 rating which of course means i did like it and recommend it.** I would elaborate on the lack of continuity in some areas of the film but that would cause me to issue a spoiler alert which i usually never do!
" Slow but cool

",2019-08-18 00:00:00,10,"Everyone should watch this movie, I mean it!
One of the greatest movies of ever seen.You'll find yourself mind blown at the end and drown in thoughts which gives you an intention to watch it several times again!!"
" Kip Thorne?? I'm in.
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,9,"This movie is a tad long, but I so get why. I couldn't have cut anything given the choice. A great science fiction film that with my background I loved that I ""got it"" - and I didn't even all the way ""get it"" - but you don't have to at all. It's still a great movie. But when I saw KT's name I knew this was something that was going to have high standards and it doesn't disappoint."
" Outstanding

" THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE !
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,10,"NO....I'M DEFINITELY NOT ASHAMED TO CALL THIS THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER MADE !!!
Everything about Interstellar is beyond great, what Christopher Nolan did with this one is absolutely incredible.
The acting is 10/10.
Hans Zimmer's composition is all time favorite.
I have watched this movie +8 times and trust me the story is so powerful you won't get bored.......far from it !"
" The greatest sci-fi movie ever created
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,10,"I am a huge Nolan fan and this movie is no exception. I first watched this movie at a fairly young age, because of this I didn't quite understand it and at the time I thought it was quite dissapointing. But after watching the movie again 3 years later I was amazed. Some movies are meant to be watched again to truly understand it.
What got me the most was the amazing soundtrack. Hans Zimmer almost always does a good job at making powerful soundtracks that really adds to the scenes. Even while listening to the soundtrack alone makes you feel the emotions you get while watching the movies, it is truly amazing.
The acting was incredible, i've never been so caught up in a movie by the acting this much. Mccounaughey does an amazing job as well as the rest of the crew. Every character is displayed perfectly and it feels as if their emotions were real.
The visuals were incredible and the movie just makes sense in any way possible.
Just everything in this movie is good and if you're a bit dissapointed by it I recommend watching it again. 10/10 something I don't give out often but this movie deserved it."
" Best movie?
",2019-08-09 00:00:00,10,"Wow...WOW.Film was so good.Film have all genres: Action,Thriller,Romantic,Comedy. You feel all of them.Never get bored to watch this.

" A Lifetime memory
",2019-08-08 00:00:00,10,"Incredible cinematic experience and storytelling, heartwarming and breathtaking background score, terrific performances, brilliant writing and spectacular visuals.Where film and filmmaking met science and technology involving massive production design. It is the greatest film of all time because it sets an example that despite being a masterpiece it didn't require an Academy award or highest rating to be a classic as it defines cinema which is nothing but engaging an audience in a runtime in best possible way, designed to watch it again and again."

" Good movie but Ann Hathaway is a terrible actress
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,7,Why on earth did anyone ever think this ugly actress should be forced upon us on screen. She is a terrible actress and we have been conned into thinking she was ever anything but.The movis is not bad....slightly overrated. Why is it that women always have to cry in movies and in life. I think that women can be equally as string as men and we have to show them as blubbering idiots. This needs to stop cos there is only one thing worse than an ugly woman on screen and that is the same ugly woman crying.So many things wrong with the proposed concept of this movie. But it was entertaining even if it's science seemed way off.
" MASTERPIECE
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,10,"Best movie exist on this planet...everything in this movie was so absorbing and heartwarming relationship between father and daughter, which led me to shed tears,,EVERYONE ONE THIS PLANET SHOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE."
" The movie surpasses its own benchmark on multiple viewing
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,10,"I have seen this movie couple of times in theatres and now it's convenient to watch it on digital platforms, In total, I have experienced this film more than 5 times and I must confess, the film grew on me every time more than my initial outings.
The science felt genuine, and it is so realistically presented. The concept of worm hole opening to a different galaxies and then exploring life in those galaxies is way futuristic and I believe with time we humans will get to that stage to understand beyond universe. To add, we have a special bond of father & daughter- so grounded, easy to relate to.
Every department be it casting, music, visualisation, dialogs, editing - everything is dealt with such precision by the filmmaker.
For me, this is one of the best works of Christopher Nolan. Brilliant envying piece of work indeed!"
" The plot the science goosebumps
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,10,"I love my science and most of it in this movie is on point. The actual plot, how it worked out got me even emotional. The story if so amazing and so intelligent I was in awe. This is an instant cinematic classic."
" A comforting entertaining lie.
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,7,"Don't worry, the planet is dying but America will rescue us.Sadly Hollywood and Fox propagates this storyline, but it is entertaining and that is the function of a movie.The sadness of course is the fact that we dont need some terrible mysterious world wide infection in a movie, it is happening."
" Watch this, right away!
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,10,"This movie had it all for me. Human drama, suspense, and scientific exploration. It made me want to get my hands on everything I could read about time travel and black holes. The music was like another character in the movie. Don't miss this one."
" Total triumph...
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,9,...except McConaughey mumbles his lines so badly i can't understand the entire initial Earth story. Otherwise a visual space masterpiece with well researched science story modules that are realistic enough to believe. The theoretical portions are the payoff where the Nolans get to play with our philosophy as well as riveting storytelling.A must see for sure.
" Best Sci-Fi movie

" Ha!
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,4,"What a waste of time!Don't believe the good reviews, this is rubbish!I was expecting a film like Prometheus, with a good storyline about humanity's future endeavours. This is poor. The ending is really bad, and doesn't make any sense. Very unbelievable. Very overrated. Ha ha, ten, Best film ever, ha ha!"

",2019-07-15 00:00:00,10,"Top notch Sci Fi, really gets you thinking, and keep thinking throughout the film. Lots of cool concepts. I don't buy many movies, but I did buy this one. I hope they do a sequel that compares. Great actors and characters."

" Nolan, just shut up for a second.
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,5,"I'm not gonna say that this is a bad movie, because one, I value the safety of me and my family; and two, I really don't think it is a bad movie, I just don't think it is the masterpiece that so many people say it is.The visuals are great and I'm sure the science is very accurate and that's very impressive......but I never enjoyed the characters.I never liked how Cooper completely ignores his son Tom, who he clearly loves less than Murph.I never liked writing.I've always had a problem with how Nolan movies are written.
Full of endless exposition and corny speeches that are meant to be deep, and this is no differenceThe following is and actual conversatiom from the movie:-------------------------------------------------------------
COOPER: All of this, is one little girl's bedroom, every moment! It's infinitely complex! They have access, to infinite time and space, but they're not bound by anything! They can't find a specific place in time, they can't communicate. That's why I'm here. I'm gonna find a way to tell Murph, just like I found this moment.TARS: How, Cooper?COOPER: Love, TARS, love.
-------------------------------------------------------------I don't know. I wanna love this movie, but I just can't.It is technically impressive, but I have no desire to watch it again."

" Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong

" Cinematography, Score, Performances, Everything just works

Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a brilliant NASA physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by transporting Earth's population to a new home via a wormhole. But first, Brand must send former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and a team of researchers through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find out which of three planets could be mankind's new home."
" Greatest science and realistic fiction movie EVER!!
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,10,"Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" was an incredible space movie about looking for a new planet to colonize after Earth starts dying. It had an incredible story arc and the music was beautiful. The movie put you on the edge of your seat waiting to see if things would go right or wrong. The acting was phenomenal and had great CGI. It had some sad parts that made the viewers feel what the characters were feeling. Overall, Interstellar was a amazing movie. Interstellar didn't win any Oscars. Oscars won Interstellar."

" GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,10,"I rate this movie 11/10 to signify it's greatness. perfection. mind blowing. a workout for your brain. I want to have debates about it. I want to write research papers on it. amazingly unbelievably awesome, this is the kind of movie that opens up your mind. lots of amazing scenes with epic music. a killer story told flawlessly. perfect directing by the best ever. great cast with great acting. a deep psychological aspect explored for numerous characters.the most renowned theoretical physicist who is an expert on cosmology was brought on to keep the science honest, as well as a retired astronaut who's been to space five times. One of the rare movies that is better the second, and even the third time watching. The only movie I have ever liked the most the fourth time I've watched it. I keep picking up on more things in the movie, and understanding better overall. So many parts are extremely moving and powerful. It does an awesome job of making you feel what the characters are feeling. (8 viewings, 2/26/2020)
SPOILERS
i was randomly thinking about interstellar, haven't watched it in at least 6 months. i thought about one hypothetical that intrigued me: what if the future ppl machine is such that it can only be placed inside an already collapsed black hole. if plan B was what ""originally"" happened and dr. brand survived, future ppl figured it out, and they want to save the ppl they left behind on earth, they need to find a love-link between someone who goes into a black hole and someone on earth smart enough to be able to solve the gravity problem = cooper and murph. doctor brand knows this because she knows cooper loves her, knows he sacrifices himself by falling into the black hole, knows his daughter grows up to be her dad's understudy, so she has the future ppl put the machine in the same black hole that cooper falls into, thereby making the entire plan work. INTRIGUING. will need to confirm on next viewing... after watching again, i like this as a viable theory, but it conflicts with another theory i had about the ""original"" mission being completed without cooperlots of awesome concepts that made me think, like murphy's law not applying close to a black hole, human survival instincts and it encompassing your children, love being a quantifiable scientific force, the black hole and time relativity. the robots were cool and original. really awesome visuals of things i've wondered about but never really imagined. i liked the depiction of the 5 dimensions in 3D in the daughters room. the way everything connected was very awesome. the different planets were so interesting with ice clouds and giant tidal waves. the endings were perfect.Something I noticed that I didn't realize the first time was the reason his son became dark and a little crazy. He was still a good person, even after experiencing the death of his daughter. However, once his wife convinced him to let go of the idea that his father was coming back, he gave up on everything in life and became a horrible husband, father and brother. The relationship between the father and daughter was the best relationship I can remember in any movie I've seen. The primary underlying theme in the movie was the love between a father and his daughter being able to transcend space and time, which is the key to her getting the information she needed to save the world.From Interstellar group chat discussion:-Or the other theory I had was that originally plan B was the one that worked and a colony survived and eventually was able to do what they did and wanted to save all the people that ended up dying on earth and try to make plan A work-So she finds out that plan a was a sham. That the professor had already solved the equation years ago before she even met him. That he knew even with solving the equation that they couldn't figure out how to get the people of the earth. She found out that they knew that they were never gonna come back and they were going to let everyone on earth to die. So every day since she was 10 that she has been hoping her father would come home was a lie. She should have never been hoping. Her entire 20 years that she dedicated her life to working on this was a complete waste . that should break a person. murph is a beast-The love between them was the only reason the world ended up being saved. It's the only reason she kept trying that hard after all those years. It's the only reason she went back to her house in her room. It's the only reason she saw the watch again. It's the only reason she figured out that the watch twitching was her dad sending the data-They got the best theoretical physicist expert in cosmology to keep the movie honest. And a retired astronaut who's been to space as a technical consultant.-Like I said before, the prevalent underlying theme is the love between a father and daughter which ends up making it possible to save the people on earth. Love is a quantifiable force that transcends time and space.12/2/16 text to malik: I watched interstellar again wow. I found a flaw in my theory that in the original timeline they used Plan B without cooper, and then when they became advanced they went back to try to get cooper so they could save the people that died on earth. The problem is, how would they have gotten past the problems with re-docking back onto the spinning blown up ship after Mann owned them. It actually makes perfect sense because in the original timeline Cooper would not have convinced them to go to dr. Mann's planet, Brand would have convinced them to go to Edmunds Planet which was the right one anyways. in that ""original"" timeline, love still saved humanity since it helped her choose the right planet."
" Nolan's masterpiece
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,10,"What's most interesting about this film is that I didn't care too much for it the first time I watched it, but fell in love the 2nd time I watched it. It's a movie that sweeps over you and immerses you into its beauty and ideas. I didn't understand what the movie was the first time I watched it. Going into it with an open mind the second time, was so amazing. It has become one of my favorite films ever. Thank you Nolan."
" I waited 5 years to watch it again
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,10,"After watching this insane movie in the theatres back in 2014 I swore to god I will wait 5 years to watch it again so I get to forget it and experince the insanity it has again

This movie is the answer of ""Will good movies come after 2010?"" and the answer is yes."
" Such a great movie
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,10,"This film was shot beautifully and had a terrific cast and storyline. Action packed, love, heartache. Very relatable!!!! A++ film."
" Raises inportant and relevant questions
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,9,"And let's not forget that it's entertaining. Nolan isn't my all-time favorite director but the main reason why I've always loved his work is that he makes us think and also entertains at the same time. Let's not forget The Prestige, Inception, Memento, hell even his entire Batman trilogy are all great examples. Large scale blockbusters, some in IMAX, magnificent practical special effects, combined with an intellect that you just don't find in other action/adventure/big budget films. Nolan has taken it to another level with each film, and who knows what's coming next. When I saw Dunkirk in 70mm (or maybe it was 65mm; dont wanna stick my foot in my mouth), I was blown away. And now we have Tenet to look forward to. Phew. This guy has been on on fire for a couple decades now and I'm sure he'll get an Oscar win soon enough.I went on a bit of a rant there, but the point is, Interstellar, minus a few flaws, is a masterwork and the negative reviews just baffle me. To the negative reviewers: Open up that mind of yours! That's the whole point. Nolan will go down as one of the greats, and it'll be a well-deserved accolade. Great direction, great cast who gave great performances, great score, great photography, great sound, editing... hell, great piece of art all around. It's truly a sci-fi classic in my opinion. Give it a chance guys!"
" Very scientific and engaging

It is my now favourite movie. As it is after all from my favourite Director and Music director. Kudos! to the team. Love it!"
" Did Cooper die?
",2019-06-22 00:00:00,10,"This is one of my all time favorite films, but in an discussion I had, does Cooper die? I read ""All time greatest plot twists"", that Dr Mann kills Cooper on his planet then escapes, or that he dies in Gargantua, but was told by Dr Romily that Gargarnua was a ""gentle singularity', which means he didn't die, but when he comes out of his state from the black hole, he sees his childrens, sees a light at the end of the tunnel""......?????????"

" One of if not my favourite film of all time
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,10,"I can't count the amount of times I've watched this film and it still amazes me and gets me in tears every time. The more we learn about space, the universe and life the more this film feels like it could be a small picture into the future reality of the human race. Amazing acting, heart wrenching, thought provoking, mind boggling."
" Boring and Flat
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,5,"Far far too long and has too many plot holes for a film trying desperately to cover every possible angle. 'Interstellar' started positively, but in soon this escalated into something which can only be applauded for its sheer cinematography and effects. The rest was quite frankly fluff ruined by poor explanations, we're led to believe this farmer was once an incredible astronaut who has to have wormholes explained to him. The twist to the movie was unfortunately clear to see from pretty much quarter of the way through which really ruined the finale. The last on screen moments also where seemed rushed and we're misguided as to what the real focus should have been. Overall the movie was mesmerising in very few places, but when done, it was done well. For the rest, it disappointed greatly, mainly being boring, flat and really lacking in memorable moments to make it the blockbuster it should have been."
" Masterpiece
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,10,"There's not much to say about it, because this movie is just perfect. and the music with Hans Zimmer, oh my God!!! The director clearly loved every minute making it. It comes down from the picture ... must see. Must embrace! Must think about it ... a lot!"

" Almost a Masterpiece
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,8,"It had been a long time since I'd seen this movie. Actually, I can tell you the exact moment I last watched this: November 7th, 2014 around 7:00 in the evening, in an IMAX theater (I feel like I'm about to start detailing a crime scene). I only saw this movie once before rewatching it for the first time last night. Why? Well, I thought the first two hours and twenty minutes of this film were absolutely spellbinding- brilliantly executed, intriguing and foreboding, intense and sometimes funny; it was perfectly acted, the music was dazzling, and the visual effects were out of this world. Then, the third act came and it took me completely out of the movie. The first time through this film I thought the third act was wildly misjudged and a whimper of a way to end this otherwise epic space odyssey. I disliked the ending so much that even though I owned the film on Blu Ray, I'd never gone out of my way to watch it again until last night. Upon my second watch, anticipating the ending, I enjoyed the film a bit more, but I still maintain that it has problems."
" Marvelous
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,10,A true cinematic masterpiece. A classic of all time.
" Mind expanding in the manner of 2001 A Space Odyssey
",2019-06-11 00:00:00,10,"A beautiful production. This is what I expect from science fiction: science fact extended with fictional situations to ponder questions from differing perspectives.
I hate the genre is filled with cheesy horror stories and am so glad this stellar filled production does not stoop low to gain boxoffice count."
" Christopher Nolan is a legend
",2019-06-11 00:00:00,9,"Christopher Nolan's 'Interstellar' is a breathtaking cinematic experience and will go down as a landmark in space-faring movies and pioneering visual effects. It's easily the most ambitious movie of Nolan's impressive career and is a movie that needs to be seen on the big screen. It even has emotional pathos and ideas about reality and relationships that have very rarely been attempted on film before. Even though there are going to be a few prominent negative points in this review, 'Interstellar' is a movie that I deeply deeply respect and while Christopher Nolan is going through uncharted territory for himself as an auteur, befitting 'Interstellar's themes, those who explore are the ones most likely to wind up lost."

",2019-06-07 00:00:00,10,Interstellar is simply a great and an incredible film to watch. It contains beautiful elements considering space and time and their connection with love in which it creates a unique perception of the world around us. Interstellar is an astounding movie from the plot to the lovely characters and their relationships to the amazing events that await the one who watches it.

The plot itself is really great, amaizing and original idea. Scenery and space itself is just insane. Beautiful beautiful. Two things I did not like was length and characters. It was just too long. Some scenes were just flying for 3 minutes or talking about nothing important for another 4. I thing characters were reather plain, I didn't really find a way to any throughout the movie."

",2019-06-02 00:00:00,10,"I have watched a lot of movies in my years. All from starwars to Disney movies. But I were talking to a friend about what movie that was the ""best"". He saints ""Interstellar"", and sins we both are studying science, we could argue about the movie. But I hadn't watched it. It took a while until I finally watched it, and I don't regret it. I loved the movie from the beginning to the end, but in the end when he told her that he made all those signs to warn her, I started to cry.... Best movie ever made!! Thank you!!!"
" One of the best movies ever made!
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,10,"I did not like it that much the first time I saw it, felt it was good but the story didn't connect much. Then I read the novel and oh my.. it made everything so much better. I highly recommend reading the novel first and watching the movie after that. I am amazed at how a space travel/ science fiction story delivers so many emotional hits. And every aspect of the movie - the visual effects, music, acting, sequencing of scenes - was just perfect. It truly took me to another world."
" So, They Could Communicate with the Past, and They Failed to Tell Which Planet?
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,1,"I believe this movie should be rated 5-6 stars.
Cooper had the ability to communicate with the past, he just can't tell NASA or his daughter the destination???
If Cooper gave the right information, they could avoid all the death and sacrifice.Mankind from the future could control gravity, and space time, and they failed to gave solution to blight????When Cooper returned to the space station, he could share all his adventure stories, so future generations learnt his adventure, and in time, when they have the scientific ability, they could pass this information to Cooper in the first place or even people from even earlier. It's a paradox.Nolan tried to be scientifically correct. Cooper gave his daughter a mechanical Hamilton watch. I believe everyone knows how a mechanical watch, it is driven by springs and gears. A mechanical watch's movement direction won't be changed permanently by gravity. Gravity would slow down the watch, but when gravitational influence were gone, the movement should go back to normal, so there is no way, Cooper could use gravitational force to ""encode"" a message into the mechanical watch because the hand of the watch wouldn't stay ""jumpy"": moving back and foreth. He would have better luck using gravity to leave message on the floor. The whole ""watch"" narrative was a big mistake.Cooper loved his daughter, okay, but what about the other kid? He acted as if he only had one kid. That's just weird.It is a good movie, black hole, wormhole stuff are easy to understand, but when you really put your brain to it, you see plot holes. Entertaining but this movie is actually quite stupid."
" Don't waste your time, almost three hours that you will not get back!
",2019-06-01 00:00:00,1,"As sad and depressing a movie as is out there. Has no redeeming value. They try to have a happy ending with the impossible fantasy... This movie could be prophetic; it describes an America after the progressives/socialists control everything. There is no longer a middle class. There is no medicine for people because the pharma industry is done away with. There is no medical equipment for the sick because the manufacturing industry is done away with. (Unless you have a congressman in your pocket!) There is no petro/chemical industry to fight the blights destroying the crops because it is done away with... The government controls every facet of your life: What job you will have, if can go to school, what you can think or say, etc... The liberal PC controls what is written in the school books to suit their 'rewrite of history' purpose (There was no Apollo moon shot!) and have complete control over & punish anyone that dares to tell the truth! In the end 'love' overcomes all the evil and bad... Emotions overcome reality... Yeah! A liberal woman's fantasy. A sick movie! Don't waste your time, almost three hours that you will not get back!"
" One of my favourites
",2019-06-01 00:00:00,10,"Everything in my opinion about this film is brilliant. The cast are perfect, the story brilliant and the whole feel of the film is excellent.
Space has always fascinated me and this concept was brilliantly based on Einstein's relativity theory.
The more I watch it the more I love it highly recommend it."
" Truly AWESOME!
",2019-06-01 00:00:00,10,"The great works of literature, are meant to be read and reread. In that we bring something different in our psyche, each time we experience them. Same might be said for all forms of art.The first time I watched this, I really enjoyed it. But for some reason, I only gave it an 8. Very likely, something on my end, interfered with the interface. Today, my second viewing, it just blew me away. Easily top 10, possibly top 3. And trust me, thats 30,000-40,000 movies. I'm old, so its doable.If for some reason you haven't seen this one.......do so today."
" Amazing masterpiece!
",2019-05-31 00:00:00,10,"I've watched this movie right now and ""Nolan"" prooved me he is a genius once again; I even can say he is best movie director of 21century...
Cinematography,Storyline,Actors,Musics,Concepts of space,Eeverything and everything was perfect.All peoples around the world must watch this movie in biggest screens with professional sound systems"
" Unbelievably a beautiful masterpiece
",2019-05-31 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is a sci-fi epic like no other in the history of films. It's a human journey into the unknown. Full of heart. It's an emotional film about love and time. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is his best work to date. The visual effects are stunning. The visuals always look real. I am a huge fan of Nolan. Every single film Christopher Nolan is a masterpiece. Interstellar is his emotional masterpiece.
In my opinion he is the best filmmakers of all time."
" A true masterpiece of the modern era
",2019-05-28 00:00:00,8,"One thing is clear; Interstellar is definetely one of the greatest movies that I have ever seen. The music, the acting, the visuals... Nolan brilliantly and skillfully mixes it all into a delicious stew of suspense, drama and physics of epic porportions! If I got the chance to completely forget about a movie, I would choose to forget Interstellar. So that I could watch it again for the first time. That is how bloody amazing it is!If you're a fan of space, suspense and films that make you think a little extra, there's no other movie that I recommend to you more than Interstellar. Even if you're not a fan of said things, you still won't regret watching this true masterpiece of the modern era."
" No words. Period.
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,10,"OK, so,... This movie is just so well done. Take any aspect you can imagine and look at it closely. The storyline was just so amazing. It really makes you think about life.
Sound was incredible , not to say the special effects. The acting was one of the best I've seen in the last couple of years, and, just the general idea...a masterpiece. 10/10, nailed it.
Recommend it, really. A rainy afternoon, in a room with low lighting, watch it. You won't be disappointed."
" A masterpiece
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,10,Was spellbound after watching such a great movie. It gave me goosebumps. I was hooked for all 3 hours. Couldn't take my eyes off screen even for a second.
" Best Film ever created

" best movie ever
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,10,"Do not go gentle into that good night,
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
Do not go gentle into that good night."
" A futuristic view of the End of our Earth
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,9,"I like this Movie a lot, like every Christopher Nolan Movie.
Its a very dramatic and emotional Movie, with a great Cast and a Story who is tremendous.
A futuristic Topic like the new Dimension they'll find, is very hard to bring to the Audience in a clear way. I thought they did it pretty well."
" Best movie ever

",2019-05-18 00:00:00,10,"Step 1
1hr before you start the HD wide-screen home theater 23.5 speaker surround sound blue ray version. Get in your pj's turn all the lights off apart from your 50 inch plus lcd lcd lcd I mean tv. Make sure the rest of the house is dark and just sit back in your beanbag and enjoy 2 hours of amazing acting. Dont watch it on your crappy 80s laptop with crusty earphones that have been in your desk drawer for 4 years so clogged up with ear wax it's surprising you could hear anything Mars was saying and still you thought you'd still give it a bad review. Even just the adds ruin what is just a great movie.Step 2
Understand why it won so many awards"
" If there ever was a good movie this is it
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,10,"Masterpice in all its glory.. a must watch over and over it will make you feel inside
go watch"
" The epitome of a breathtaking and realistic Sci-Fi film.
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar undeniably stands out from other sci-fi films made over the years, in particular, for three main reasons, as I see it. The story's plot is believable. The film has a timeless and heartwarming take-home value. And Interstellar's visuals do nothing less than bewilder and captivate even the most critical of the Sci-Fi genre.The film's familiar modern theme of escaping a dying-planet merges with its rich and lovable characters, quite literally sending its audience into the far reaches of space to get an eyeful of plausible science, beautiful distant worlds, and profound human emotions.Interstellar more-than-effectively captures the undying American and international dream of space exploration while highlighting the urgent importance of maintaining our planet's balance for many more generations. This film will take you on a time-defying journey of love and mystery which is sure to engage your mind and touch your heart in a way other stories simply cannot."
" Great movie - no midgets
",2019-05-17 00:00:00,8,I watched this movie from the very beginning to the very end and there are no midgets in this movie. Very disappointing that there are no midgets in this movie

" Awesome
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,10,"I've watched this movie too many times to count, and am still struck by the brilliance presented by everyone involved. The score is beyond perfect.
Spoilers Alert:
Despite, or perhaps because of, the one central plot hole the movie is riveting. Humanity is saved because of intervention from an advanced civilization. This civilization is actually humanity's far distant descendants. Humanity saved itself; the paradox is that the future humans would not exist, unless they did intercede!"
" Interesting and intelligent.
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,8,"A a very interesting, intelligent sci-fi thriller indeed. Another i urge anyone interested in, not only the exploration of space (which right now is a hot topic) but lovers of movies with both fine acting and a sharp script. To actually transfer a story this clever to screen is some achievement (and not since '2001' have we enjoyed a computer/robot, with such a warm personality). Leading the cast is the great Mathew McConaughty, who plays a maverick space pioneer."
" No no no I cannot believe
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,1,Are usually write good comments about movies because I choose good movies but this time I was fooled by the rating and I mean the good rating man what the heck I just lost 1.5 hours of my life watching this movie and I thank God I fast forward the Resting one hour man what is this movie 2 1/2 hours why for what very complex very hard to understand very science-fiction nothing to understand
" I really liked this film and the music in this film.
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,10,I really liked this film and the music in this film.
" A true cinematic masterpiece - flawless from start to finish
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar doesn't put a foot wrong, a brilliant 169 minutes covering space, survival and raw human emotion. Hans Zimmer's near-perfect soundtrack is the ideal accompaniment to these epic scenes, adding drama and gravity to every meticulous shot. Equally, the storyline is beyond gripping, a brutally believable tale of a desperate, dying race driven to do anything for survival, balanced against what a father would do for his children.Christopher Nolan's vision of a dying Earth is a stark blend of oranges and greens - crop fields stretching for miles, only to be overwhelmed by the towering dust storms. Leaving Earth, space (and indeed the planets visited) are all equally magical in their own unique ways: Miller's aquatic landscape is eerily bleak, whilst Mann's ice planet is as mind-bending as it is picturesque. Space travel is also done true justice, using wide-angle shots to both convey the vastness of space and the insignificance of man.Matthew McConaughey was practically built for this role, a farmer-turned-engineer trying to juggle saving earth and saving his family; his interactions with Brand (Anne Hathaway) and his daughter Murphy (Jessica Chastain) define the film, testing the strengths of human relationships and their value, even over the distances of space. Credit must also be given to TARS (Bill Irwin), a superbly written, pseudo-sentient robot that becomes as integral a member of the crew as any other.Interstellar is arguably the best sci-fi/space film ever created, superb in every way. The reported scientific accuracy Nolan paid attention to when writing the film is the icing on the cake, allowing the plot to be full lived - unlike anything that has come before."
" Believe me it's masterpiece of 3 decades
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,10,"There is no reason to not watch this movie
It consists love ,drama, science (of High level which definetly trusted ,studied and never seen before) suspense and thrill
This movie is also platinum coat of Hans Zimmer sound effects
If you not seen this movie you missing great taste of entairtenment"
" The 21st Century's Masterpiece
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,10,"I have watched this movie 3 years ago , since then I couldn't stop thinking about it . I'm a huge Nolan fan and this movie was the finest work that he ever did... The duality between Nolan and Hans zimmer took it highest level of perfection in Interstellar.
I have never seen anything like this... I would recommend you to see this masterpiece as soon as you can even if you love sci-fi or no."
" A memorial of modern time. A history of the future
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,10,It's perfect in every aspect! It doesn't have any collision with any physical laws. The story line is impressive and logical. It fixes with every principles which makes a perfect scifi!
" A thought provoking film
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,8,"A thought provoking film that embodies state-of-the-art technology and sheer scientific brute strength to convey its story. Despite a few sci-fi ""Cliches"" that it could have done without, this movie is a masterpiece in storytelling through the cinematic medium. The score by Hans Zimmer is one of his best scores ever and accentuates the film during its ""slower momentum"". The performances by every single actor on screen is joyous to watch and is simply world class. Beautiful directed and wonderfully produced. A ""Modern Cinematic Classic & Masterpiece""."
" A True Masterpiece
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,10,"The story, the cinamatography, the direction, everything was so well done.
I love both Mackenzia Foy and Jessica Chastain (Murph's) really brought the film together in terms of the presence of strong-minded character.
I wasn't too pleased with Mcacanaughey's acting. It would have been great if his mouth wasn't hanging all the damn time.The end really disappointed me, until I read an article about how everything that happened after Cooper enters the Gargantua happened in his head, because of how unlikely most things were, starting from how any life could handle the gravity of a black hole. Having TARS just thrown away in the house replica was absolutely ridiculous, considering all the information he retrieved from Gargantua. Also, why would they live on a spaceship, when they could travel through the wormhole and find a planet of their own?
Not to mention, when has Nolan ever had a complete ending?
Anyways, the casting for the rest of the film was well done, finding such accurate older and younger Murph's and Tom's was amazing.This is such a beautiful film, with such beautiful concepts of distortion of time, space, and gravity, and of course, in the non-cheesiest of ways, love.
My two favourite scenes were the No Time For Caution, undoubtedly enhanced by Hans Zimmer's magic, and the tesseract scene, where time is the fifth dimension.Well done, Nolan. I have no words except that this is a true timeless masterpiece"
" A spiritual successor to 2001
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar is in my opinion Matthew McConaughey's best film. This movie serves as a spiritual successor to 2001: A Space Odyssey. It takes the audience on a journey through space implementing real science into the mix. The emotional struggle between Murph and a father that she doesn't see most of her life is so incredibly touching and well done. I cried 3 times at different points purely because of the emotions felt by Cooper and Murph. Stunning visuals, amazing concept, and an ending that is complex enough that half of the audience doesn't really understand. I love that"
" Best movie of all time
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,10,"Just brilliant. This movie is the best written, acted, vidusl effected. Matthew is great actor and his one of the best performance. I dont cry in movies a lot but in this movie, i cried like a kid"
" A True Masterpiece
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,10,"Nolan's modus operandi ended with a beautiful scene. Interstellar is a masterpiece. It's visually beautiful, ingenuous in parts and left you dumbfounded. I wish I could express it more enthusiastically, but this is one of my favorite movies and I think it will suit you well."
" Monumental movie! Titanic work!
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,10,"One of the brilliant films in the space and scientific topics. Very interesting characteristic of the children, and the outcome of events for all mankind. The essence of the, as the search for possible pathways for save and return. For the salvation of all mankind... and for the return of loved ones.It is very interesting that there is nothing superfluous in this film. Interesting and sincere acting. Well-chosen props and scenery.
Pleasant and convenient for the viewer's eyes computer graphics."
" I Good Space Adventure
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,6,"Interstellar is basically the more intellectual version of The Core from 2003 with much better effects. The story is very similar. In both movies the Earth is dying. To save it a secret organization funded by the government assembles a team of scientists, of which most are used for cannon fodder, to save the planet. The only differences are that instead of traveling to the core of the Earth they go into space. Plus, Interstellar is a more intellectual and thought-provoking piece than a summer blockbuster which was what The Core was. There are many similarities to 2001: A Space Odyssey as well. I think Nolan really tried to make this the modern 2001 and his fans really want this to be too. Interstellar is definitely an ambitious movie for Nolan even more than Inception was. I think it succeeds in most of what it set out to do, but does fall a bit short in a couple areas.The main selling point is the effects which are breathtaking. Like films like Gravity or Jurassic Park this is a film that you should see in theatres just to experience the awesome effects. The film sounds great and has a terrific score; though it can get make scenes seem too over-dramatic at times. I will say that this is a better-looking movie than Avatar. Plus, unlike Avatar, Interstellar has more to offer than just the spectacle.The acting is also superb. Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and the rest of the cast all do fantastic performance-wise and I did like all of the characters. I even enjoyed the side cast even though most of them were there just to die and provide drama. I think this has to do with the actors and how well they sold the characters.However, I do have a couple issues in regards to the story. The story itself is great but it could've been executed better in some areas. While I enjoyed the side character, most had no reason to be there and were basically used for cannon fodder. Also the film was too long. There were many scenes and story elements that felt irrelevant. When they go through the worm hole and enter the other galaxy they have three worlds to choose from and they go to every single one which takes at least twenty minutes for each. While, from a visual perspective, it was amazing seeing all these different worlds and it did provide some drama. However, in terms of the overall the story it felt mostly like padding. The point is the movie did not need to be almost three hours.Lastly, there was one story element I was not really a fan of which ties into the ending. I know it has to do with time which is one of the main plot elements of the film. However, the way it's presented in the film is a bit weird and silly compared to the rest of the film. Plus they didn't explain it as well as they should've making it rather confusing. I know complicated is virtually Nolan's trademark, but I still felt that he made the film more complicated than it needed to be. It is already a strong film without the twist at the ending. It really felt like Nolan was trying for a 2001 ending. Even though I like this film more I do think the ending to 2001 was done better than the ending of Interstellar.Overall, Interstellar is a pretty well-done space adventure. It was an amazing visual ride, the acting was great, I liked the majority of the characters, and it had some intriguing ideas and good drama. However, some of its ideas aren't explored or explained enough I felt. Many of the side characters, while likable, feel shoehorned in. Plus the film went on a bit too long and the ending could've been better. Even with those issues I still highly recommend the film and suggest you see it in theatres. It's a great experience."
" Underrated Masterpiece
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,10,Everything from plot line to soundtrack is stunning. The story gets you thinking and an amazing stand alone movie. I can't explain how impressed I am. Amazing...
" Best Movie Ever
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie has gone done down in history as my all time favorite movie. I'd feel bad if I didn't give it ten stars because I love it so much. It is very exciting, sad, and thought proving (Keyword: thought provoking). Why is it only 31? It should be AT LEAST in the top ten."
" Insightful
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,10,The movie really is portrayed in the best way possible.one of the great work not only showing the essence of space travel but also did good in representing 5th dimension in a 3rd dimension so everyone can understand it clearly
" loved it!
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,9,"Talking about something unknown like scientific unsolved problems is such a big risk! but i love the way nolan risks to show us big world problems like time dimention and black whole in his movies.
beside of it, stunning work of hans zimmer made me 10 time more excited. i loved it. this movie is a masterpiece."
" It's necessary to watch it again.
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,7,"Until the middle, I had thought that this movie was epic.
But I couldn't understand well and wondered its integrity from a scene of five dimensional space. Maybe I was sleepy.I should watch it again another time."
" The best film I have ever seen
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,10,All is amazing. I can't describe anything. It's a film that leads you to think about yourself and your plans in your life. I am a real series/movies' lover and... This was awesome.

",2019-04-12 00:00:00,9,While this was a really good movie. I would to have liked to have seen a little more character development. I also would love to hear more about how he went in between space and time and how much he truly did affect his daughters life and maybe a little more back story as to why the citizens left Earth. But overall i really enjoyed this movie and personally love Matthew McConaughey and cant wait to see him in more successes in the future.

The emotion it gives me every time i watch it are unbelievable, i just cry because i have no word to describe how beautiful it is. That happens probably because i love space movie, but the immense work done here is amazing, everything from the soundtrack, to the special effect, to the acting is PERFECT. Nolan simply did it, he created the perfect movie, at least form me, and i can only say thank you..."
" I am so sad I didn't watch it in IMAX
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,10,"I can't describe with words how much I love this movie but I'll try. This is my second favorite movie of all time and favorite from Nolan. Interstellar has maybe the best assembled cast ever and I will just name few names like: McCounaghey, Hathaway, Caine, Casey Affleck, Timothee Chalamet, Chastain, Burstyn, Lithgow and more. This movie gets better and better with every rewatch and I can tell you I was very confused when I watched it first time. I really like space movies and Interstellar is stunning with amazing score. Interstellar is the same that 2001 was for that time and what it means now, a modern masterpiece."
" A deeply emotional survival journey through space and time
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,9,"A truly unique masterpiece with only few flaws. I just wish I experienced it in a cinema, in a proper way. Nevertheless, in the comfort of my home this film was still extraordinary.Acting? Top-notch. Matthew McConaughey along with Mackenzie Foy/Jessica Chastain/Ellen Burstyn created a beautiful bond as Cooper and Murph. Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine or John Lithgow were amazing as always. Visuals? One of the best I have seen. Music? Hans Zimmer proves again that he is indeed a master in his line of work. Just perfect. Plot? Better and better as the action develops.The cosmos always intrigued me, and it's unexplored secrets are one of the topics to continue for decades and centuries. A struggle for survival in the dust covering the doomed Earth, space, planets, black holes, wormholes, secrets, gravity - it's all shown in Interstellar. And one of the most important - love."
" Innovative Ideas, Innovative Story, Innovative Ending
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,10,"Many creative ideas about world that I never thought of, enjoyed this movie a lot, at start it was a bit boring, but from middle to end I was completely focused on it that I was shocked when something happened !
Story was creative too, the journey was amazing, ending ? that was one of the best that could possibly happen, could be longer but I guess movie was already 3 hours and they didnt wanted to make it more long ! 10/10 Recommend it to anyone"
" A Space Movie Actually Made Interesting
",2019-04-04 00:00:00,9,"I am not going to go into spoilers but just know that in the horde of uninspired and generic space movies, Interstellar shines brightly. It is a masterpiece of subversions and it just keeps on building and building its plot and raising the stakes higher with each second and it keeps you at the edge of your seat constantly as you are wondering how it will all end. One of the most satisfying movies that I have ever watched and it will blow your mind."
" Scientific
",2019-04-04 00:00:00,10,"The entire movie was scientifically accurate. The lack of sound in space allowed me to get a good listen on the score. The only thing that was theoretical was the enterence into the black hole. The only reason why I say this was theoretical and not inaccurate, was because we don't have an actual answer to what is inside of a black hole.
Overall the plot was good. The movie did have a few sad parts. The one thing I don't understand is why NASA decided to recruit Matt Damon for the Mars missions in the Martian after the shenanigans he pulled in this movie."
" Unrealistic Age Changes
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,5,The age change of the characters is unrealistic. Murph ages on earth but Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway don't age in space.

" Hmmmm
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,5,It was a rather.... strange movie the plot was ok. the movie was ok. Not really my cup of tea. It was long and at times boring. Then mystery was kinda dull
" Great Movie
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies I've ever watched.. Initially it seemed boring at the beginning but when the scene came up and Cooper hacked the airforce drone, i knew it was going to be a nice movie... I loved Inception, this was another masterpiece from Christoper Nolan."
" One of the Best Space movies I've seen
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,9,This movie is a work of art in the science division. The consept of Black Holes and its effect on time and space is somewhat explained in this movie. Watching it in a big screen gives you the feeling of being in space. I first watched it in IMAX though I wished it was in 3D for complete immersion into space. Christopher Nolan gave his best in this movie as he has done in his previous works. This is a must watch for anybody who loves Sci-Fi movies.
" Super overrated, tried to be something it's not
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,3,"This movie tried to be an awe-inspiring sci fi movie that leaves you in wonderment, but in doing so they forgot to make the movie any good.

I honestly don't know why so many people enjoy this film."

",2019-03-25 00:00:00,10,The movie is breathtaking from the first scene to the last. The whole cast worked perfectly. I was already a fan of Cristopher Nolan for his Inception and The Prestige but Interstellar places him a tier higher. The most unpleseant thing is that the movie did not received any Oscar at all. But we are here to make Interstellar rate as higher as possible so it will be remarkable as it deserves to be.
" The best I've ever seen... My favorite movie!
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,10,"This is grand great magnific movie. All emotions are inside. Es una obra de arte, i loved the McConaughey Role üòÆ there is a lot of mistakes but it takes you in...Christopher Nolan is a genius üòç
I loved it!"
" wow!
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,10,"This film is a wonderful masterpiece given to us by Christopher Nolan The most beautiful film witness my life directed by my imagination of the creative always Christopher Nolan and the performance of a great representative of the wonderful Matthew McConaughey and beautiful I Hathaway and the cornerstone of the film the entire music of the great Hans Zmr, which excites what the scene says everything was mastered by Directed from filming to acting and music Everything is great and workmanship High Film will be the best I have seen for a very long time and I will enjoy every time I watch"
" I have a noble winning paper inspired by this!
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,9,"Based on this movie, I have come up with the idea of what I call special relativity. This is based on time gowing slower when speed going fast. I have conducted a formulai for this e=mc squared, which scientificlaly proves life qnd why they wasted so much time compared to earth time thanks"
" A film that takes its time
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,8,"The slowness of this narrative got to me at times. Minus the pacing, another fine Nolan installment"
" One of the best films I've ever seen.
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,10,Brilliant storyline that will make you laugh and make you cry. You will be at the edge of your seat. The massive bonus is a masterful soundtrack that will do everything to you that the film does. Watch it please.
" I'd give it an 11 if I could!!!
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,10,Just Amazing everything! Touching story and best visual effects I've seen in awhile! This movie will never be forgotten! It'll stick with you forever!
" A very good movie about space, science and other concepts
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,10,"The director managed to make the insertion into space and science with high concepts of love, moral values and the social construct of a person. That is pretty fascinating, though none of these values were deeply explored, they were considered when dealing with great events that shape consciousness and that is successful for me already. It would have been easy to feel bogged down and overwhelmed by such concepts if done badly, but the director did well to make these stand out to be considered and hopefully that could mean a higher level of thinking for us in the future. Though such stuff is foolhardy to expect from anyone so that is also indicative of our potential greatness if we could make it happen at least often enough to be elevated in our minds."
" What's with the hype?
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,7,Matt does a great job as always. The soundtrack and set design were outstanding. The visuals and editing were incredible. But the story? It was lacking in compulsion.
" A handful of minor flaws swept away in a hurricane of brilliance.
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,10,"This movie is complex enough that it requires a bit of mental gymnastics to pierce the surface fog of confluent ideas as we are drawn into a dystopian future. The stereotypical ""mans greed"" blowing up the planet gets left for a more simple but interesting ""earths ecology has outgrown us"" plot. NASA's Dr Brand draws on a number of scientific facts to base the ensuing world event of plant destroying blight, while at the same time juxtaposing the ""failed wars of attrition"" meme and then the civilian rewrite of history meme where the Apollo moon landings where fictional ""history"".The so called ""educational professionals"" lacking knowledge of actual science history becomes a bit grating as do the retro looks at future solar cells that can ""power farms"" . The icing on this cake is when we learn that future humans decide in great wisdom that MRI""s are more a convenience than a necessity. As none existed to diagnose Coopers wife. Again these small flaws amount to a few pot holes worth of plot devices on a highway star ride to another galaxy. The ever rustic voice inflections of McConnahey help water down some of the pretentiousness of the pending ""end of the world"" and the addition of Lithgow as father in law of widower Cooper works magic. 2010:YWMC fans will recall Lithgow has already had his shot at leaving earths orbit.The real emotional tension is the 3 way struggle of egos between Astronaut Brand (Hathaway), Space Cowboy McConnehey and his equally head strong daughter, Murphy. The technical use of AI as a supporting character was just the right touch to keep the objectiveness of events in reach of the viewer. Nolan pays homage to the age old, artificial lifeform we have come to expect in this genre, and has been so well perceived since before Robby the Robot. I found myself wishing and really half expecting TARS to break into a HAL9000 version of ""Daisy"" just to annoy Cooper.The betrayal by the assumed hero, Dr Mann and the subsequent heroic mission save by Cooper to dock with a spinning out of control station yields the definitive moment when Brand and Cooper are finally united in mind and spirit not just to survive but find a way to achieve something with the remaining assets of the now shambles of their mission. Here again small science flaws, like the near impossibility of approaching a black hole at such distances and surviving can be overlooked for the moment we discover who ""THEY"" are and the part Cooper and his sidekick robot dog TARS will play.The final scenes close with the third iteration of Murphy Cooper as the time paradox reaches it's conclusion and the now older than her father, wiser, daughter of Cooper sends him on one final mission, a man lost in time as it were, travelling yet again to the one person left alive that actually knows who he is and truthfully means something to him.This movie really deserves more than 10 stars as it portrays the epic heroes journey as well as has been done and blends the story in a future of a bleak fate of human extinction and hope for survival in the process. Interstellar is Chris Nolans Mona Lisa."
" Rage against the dying of the light.
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,10,"I find it hard to articulate how powerful this film is and how it effects me. Chris Nolan has set the bar higher than he did on 'Inception'. The story is based on probable science , with help from Kip Thorne. The cast is perfect. Matthew McConaughy as the former pilot and everyman' who is battling a desire to do what he is destined to do . Fly an outerspace mission or stay on a dying world and looking after his kids. Nolan regular Michael Caine , Jessica Chastain , Timothee Chalamet and Anne Hathaway round out the main cast. The surprise packet is young Mackenzie Foy who's daughter /father relationship drives the emotional side of the film. The robot TARS was my favourite character in the film. He was the humour and he shows human quality when all seems lost.
Hans Zimmer's score maybe the best he's EVER done! Pulsating and driving and plays on the heart strings like no other score I can remember.
Through the nearly 3 hours I was on the edge of my seat following the crews every move and all the while following the seemingly doomed mankind on earth. It's hard to go into specific parts of the film without spoilers.
I laughed , Cried and cheered with jubilation throughout. An instant 10/10 that gets better on viewing. I can't stress how much I recommend this film. Drop what you're doing!!"
" A Meaningful and Breathtaking Movie...
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,10,"My math tutor, Mr. Lee, actually recommended this movie to me. He told me it was one of the highlights of his movie experiences. I laughed and told him I would watch it, due to his sake. And when I watched it, it was breathtaking. My eyes were glued to the television screen. I didn't even notice my dad walking away to grab a cup of coffee. I was completely trapped into the movie. This movie not only tells a breathtaking story of space and has beautiful photography, it tells about the bond between a father and his family. Cooper is such a strong man. It gets us thinking about what it would be like to have to leave our family and everything we love and care about behind to save all of humanity, only to find that it was all worthless and to hope for the better. It made me cry, seeing Cooper watch the videos of his son growing up, and seeing his daughter all grown up, Murph, for the first time. It was so meaningful. It's a simple and beautiful story. And as a daughter, I thought about what it would be like to not see my father for so many years, as he struggled to save the world. Please watch this movie. You'll be captured by everything it has to offer. This was one of the futuristic stories that actually made my hairs bristle. If we don't do our best to conserve our resources, many people would have to give up everything they need. Thank you for listening."
" Gripping, Check; Great Performances, Check; Too long, Hell No!
",2019-03-11 00:00:00,9,"It's my 5th viewing and when did the 169 mins flew I don't know, my eyes were glued to the screen the whole time. Yeah, the score was a repetitive but couldn't agree more with the fact that it was emotionally packed, Hans Zimmer knows what he's doing? Sometimes it feels like the melodrama between Cooper and his daughter ruining the impactful theme of the film but again it was for the emotional connection between those two individuals.Good:- Chris Nolan's Direction, The Nolan brother's tight screenplay, Hoytema's brilliant cinematography, Zimmer's powerful score, Gorgeous visual effects (I like it more than Gravity coz it didn't show us more, it shows less and the rest is left to us to imagine), Great Production Design, somewhat a loud sound effects (due to which some of the dialogue inaudible) but nonetheless it was pretty damn great and The cast's powerful performances specially Mackenzie Foy (as Young Murphy),is a one young talent I don't want to miss.Bad:- The only (and main) reason why the whole concept of the movie didn't suit because of the blight situation. Even with a voracious blight it would take million of years to reduce the Earth's oxygen from it's atmosphere.That's why I give it a 9/10, the only bad reason is also a big enough. So, overall I frickin loved it, hope to see this film again. Just wait for 20 years and it'll be a definite Sci-fi Classic, I mean it'll be a cult classic in those 20 years for sure. (well, it's still a classic though! ;-))"
" The best movie i ever saw
",2019-03-11 00:00:00,10,"To me it's the best movie ever made in history of cinema so far.
I won't go into any details here ,you should watch it and make up your own mind."
" A movie to understand Existence
",2019-03-11 00:00:00,9,"A fiction on facts, how our existence is driven..
An amazing storyline to define time, dimensions and how mathematics makes our survival. Its a story for our next generation to harp on.
Cheers to the makers. Must watch !!"
" Masterpiece
",2019-03-11 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the best movie experience ever,..and well its one of the masterpiece of Christopher Nolan..."
" NASA said this is the most realistic deep space travel movie.
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is one of those movies you can watch over and over and still get a new appreciation for the film. I love Nolan's films. He is arguably my favorite film writer and director. Even though this is a science fiction movie, it feels very real. Nolan has such a talent for making his films seem real. Deep space Exploration is just around the corner in real life, but Nolan gives us the most realistic look at it in this film. As always, Nolan does an amazing job at putting together a terrific cast, special effects and takes you on the most incredible adventure that is out of this world. Interstellar is one film you have to see, even if you are not a big science fiction fan. The ending is worth the watch."
" Stellar movie
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,7,The vast amount of space is always been intriguing and waiting to be discovered. This movie dives deep into these ideas and gives a complex and adventurous route through time and space. Open your mind sit back and enjoy a good movie.
" A science fiction masterpiece only Christopher Nolan could deliver.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,10,"The first time I saw this film, I was speechless. I knew what to expect from Christopher Nolan, who had been steadily increasing his repertoire for almost two decades. Each of his films outdid the last and built on the already mind-blowing pieces that have gone before them. From The Following (1998) to Memento (2000) to The Prestige (2006) to Inception (2010), I wondered how he could outdo himself with his first foray into hard science fiction. Needless to say, I was impressed by Interstellar (2014) and Nolan's ability to bring the theoretical and incredible ideas of interstellar travel into an entirely plausible setup.As was the case with his previous films, Nolan manages to bring together almost disjointed moments into a cyclical narrative. Much like Memento, I wanted to sit down and watch the whole thing again immediately after viewing it for the first time, so that I could catch all the little things that lead to the major reveal at the end. Even with a running time of almost three hours, I'd gladly sit through two back-to-back viewings to fully embrace the impact of this film. This is the power of storytelling that Nolan has shown over the years and still maintains today, regardless of genre.While some people would fault Interstellar for its loud music, I feel it is the perfect counterpoint to the silence of outer space. The swell of Hans Zimmer's score matches perfectly with the power and emotion brought out through the characters. There's nothing more heart-wrenching than watching a father filter through a lifetime of his children growing up before his eyes in mere minutes. The sheer scale of the film is something I have rarely seen in movies. It makes you truly understand how small we are in the universe. When the credits finally roll, you'll have laughed, you'll have cried (a lot), and you'll finally have a chance to catch your breath.A science fiction masterpiece only Christopher Nolan could deliver, I give Interstellar 5.0 stars out of 5."
" Masterpiece
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,10,"This gave me a lot of Kubrick vibes. The music is superb, the acting as well. It can be a little tough to understand for people who aren't familiar with quantum physics but it's not pretentious and purposefully complicated. I honestly couldn't find any major flaws to this movie. One of Nolan's best work."
" one of the tops
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,10,"This movie is definitely one of the best movies i have ever seen and it just some kinda changed my life with an amazing soundtrack . i just wanna say if u havent seen it yet , rush rush go and watch it."
" space ghost
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,2,"One tip for movie makers when making said movie use actors that one can understand,even with subtitles I can't understand what m.m. says like having marbles in his mouth tom hardys the same.As far this movies concerned what starts with some reasonable ideas soon turns into a ghost story"
" A single masterpiece that leaves you speachless
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,10,"This is one of Nolan's many masterpieaces but it has a meaninf like no other film in history. It explores an idea about life, survival, time, love and so much more that we do not understand and probably never fully will. Thats why it's so good."
" Interesting storyline
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,9,Very interesting storyline and ending. The acting was not although that much as expected.
" A fascinating look at our potential future.
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,8,"I saw this movie and at first, thought it was just cool. It looked cool, it sounded cool, it was just interesting to look at. I didn't realize the full story until I rewatched it. That might be because I was a kid at the time, but now since I finally understand the story, I have a lot more appreciation for this film. The science and realism this movie is grounded in is impressive. Everything felt real and there's were a lot of moments heartbreaking and also kept my attention due to their intensity. The story is very confusing and packed with science so if you don't understand it you need to rewatch it. I got it at the second or third viewing, and I also pay close attention to events concerning the plot. The future this world presents is very interesting to look at and observe. They shroud a lot in mystery or open to interpretation but it's supposed to be like that. The characters are very interesting, especially the robots. The soundtrack is really good, it kept me really invested and it's a key part of the film. So, besides the confusing story its overall a great look at our possible future and a good film. 8/10."
" Nolan will never fail us.
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,10,One of the greatest sci fi films of all time. Christopher Nolan proves that he is a master director with every film including Interstellar.
" A Sci-Fi movie that makes sense
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,10,"Soundtrack is amazingRealistic, 2001-ish space happeningsStory without potholesIt is a fantastic movie!
No other way to say it.
The soundtrack fits the scenes, scenes that are well writen, acted in a natural manner filling a story that just makes sense."
" Another overrated crap.
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,1,"Another OVERRATED CRAP from one of many overrated and pretentious Hollywood directors, Christopher ""oh i'm so smart"" Nolan. Wake up silly people! These ""masterpieces"" are not brilliant or smart as ""they"" say. Besides none great director would use Anne Hathaway in any of their movies LOL"
" Can't stop watching.
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,10,"This is really one of the best movies i'd ever seen. Fantastic story, that can happened at any time in the future. So we must be prepared for this and do the right things."
" Inter-not-so-stellar
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,6,"I dont think this movie was even meant to make a whole lot of sense. But it is still an avenue explorer, even an interesting one at that, if only it wasn't boring initially. The movie took a while to pick up pace. At the end, when father and daughter meet, the fact that she always believed in him, even when he wasn't there, knew that he would come back, even though he didn't for a 100 years, moved me to tears. It is a well made movie, for sure."
" This movie from another world
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,10,"Best movie i have ever seen in my life
Acting
Music
Nolan
All things are freaky"
" Love has no limits
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,10,"When you look back at cinema will you remember movies like the Artist or The Post, or will it be Interstellar? For me, Interstellar is the pinnacle of filmmaking. Original, Breathtakingly Beautiful, and Powerful. Christopher Nolan outdid himself here. I didn't think Inception could be beat. Yes, The Dark Knight will be seen as Nolan's Mona Lisa to most, but there's one element missing or lacking, and that is love. Yes Bruce Wayne loves Rachel, and gets his revenge, but the heart-wrenching and heart-string pulling love isn't there like it is in Inception and Interstellar. Christopher Nolan's original material has one common thread, save for Dunkirk, and that is The beauty and Power of Love. In Inception, Dom did everything to see his kids and to be reunited with them. In Interstellar, Cooper goes on a mission across space and time to secure his kids future, who are on a dying planet. While the decisions may at first glance seem to be selfish and unloving, the grand reveal at the end reaffirms to you that Love transcends everything and that the main protagonists were right to do what they did. The last scene where Dom is reunited with Murph is one of the most overwhelmingly powerful moments in movie history , despite being so short. But the length of that scene is deliberately done so that you have no time to stew on it. Cooper was a father first and a hero second, and that is the way it should be. Interstellar is a space opera, a blockbuster epic, and a love story. True cinema. There's no axe to grind, there's no social justice they are trying to achieve, it is just simply how movies should be made. I said this with Inception, but Interstellar will be impossible to beat, but knowing Christopher Nolan, he will probably beat it."
" Very close
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,7,The film had amazing acting and incredible visuals and ideas. Christopher Nolan really went all in with this one and I thought it was so close to be a classic. Every actor and actress did a great job and they really made you feel for the family getting ripped apart to try to save the human race. I really liked how they showed people's survivor instincts as well as their selfishness. That felt real. Some of the end I didn't love but it was still a really cool movie. Some of the visuals and cinematography was great and I loved the silence during the explosions. I'd say it was a little too long and I didn't love the end otherwise I'd have given this a higher score.
" Very enjoyable. - Rewatchable even.
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,9,"This is a text book cinematic blockbuster. Great acting, effects and stroy telling. Read more artsy reviews for details, or just sit down and enjoy the film. It's best you see for yourself."
" Best movie I have seen so far. A must-watch
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,10,"I never thought I'd like a Sci-Fi / Space film this much. This is Nolan's best. Really over the top. If you earn some background of Space physics before watching, you'll get the most out of this masterpiece but even if not, you will still place this in your all-time favourites. cause it's pretty much self-explanatory.
A film you will not regret a minute. One you would probably wanna watch again and again."
" Interstellar
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,10,"Nolan's involvement brought science fiction movies to a new height. You don't need a chair to watch Nolan's movies, because you have to kneel down and watch it. If Einstein is still alive, you will pat him on the shoulder and do a dirty job: boy, your TM is great. In high-scoring science fiction works, you can always see his name, ""Batman - Dark Knight"" is crushing the existence of all the Marvellous films, even subdued to destroy the hegemony. Wormholes, black holes, multi-dimensional space, through the interstellar, the scientific basis of the work is solid, rich in content, shocking pictures, ups and downs of the plot. The vast universe, human beings are so small. In the multidimensional universe, everything can be quantified, time will slow down, an hour is equivalent to seven years of the earth, can live to the future, only love, will not be quantified, is the ultimate link between people, Cooper's love for family, for friends, and not because of the distortion of time and space. If ""Wandering Earth"" has made a good start for Chinese science fiction movies, then ""Star Crossing"" is an example that we are catching up with. In other words, if Nolan had a long life, he would have contracted out high-scoring science fiction movies."
" Waste of time!
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,1,Supeeeeeeer boring! OMG!!!!! The story didn't make any sense! The quality of everything in this movie was low!
" Best movie to watch and cry
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie four times and every time I feel my soul freezing
I have no words to describe this movie like then deserv
Hug your soul and watch this"
" It's almost the best hard science fiction movie ever
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,9,"It's almost the best hard science fiction movie ever. It's totally beyond expectations. After slowly describing the state of the earth, the theme was presented in peaceful language. Subsequently, the rhythm of the story began to accelerate, climax after climax. Especially the rotating docking part. Not very fond of the end, the explanation of the five-dimensional space is fairly simple, but the final regression is a little far-fetched."
" One of the most disappointing movies I've ever watched
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,4,Everyone was praising this movie but honestly the ending was really bad for me. Maybe it's because I don't know much about that stuff about dimensions and other things mentioned. But honestly it really disappointed me. And in the whole movie there was too much physics so if you don't know it well you probaby wouldn't understand most of the things.The other thing that was useless was the whole thing about love. It didn't fit well into the theme of the movie and it was unnecessary.
" Absolutely incredible
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,10,"This is the only movie that continually blows me away every time I watch it. From the story line, the performances, to Hans Zimmer's piercing musical composition, this movie will move you. Emotional, powerful, and truly one of the greatest movies ever made."
" Best science fiction movie
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,10,I don't understand what can i say......Mind blowing concept....
" Perfect Film
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,10,Christopher Nolan produces another visually stunning film with a complex and mind-blowing plot. Matthew McConaughey is brilliant. The film never feels like it's dragging despite its length. Nolan's Best Movie in my opinion. First ever viewing at the cinema took my breathe away. Personal Favourite.
" Time is flexible
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,10,"Can't describe how incredible it is.The flim refreshed my knowledge of space and science.Love Matthew's performing,very powerful.
Universe is up to whether you dare to imagine"
" Wasn't Nolan's best
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,7,"I don't know....maybe the lead casting was wrong but the pacing of the film was slow (which is typical of Nolan films) but there wasn't enough to keep my attention as his previous films. Again, cinematography and soundtrack are where his films excel and Interstellar is no different."
" A great piece of art
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,10,"That movie is not just a movie. It is a great piece of art. Inspiring, in most parts scientific, words are too little to descripte it. Not to mention that the Nobelist Kip Thorne was the scientific advisor."
" MASTERPIECE!!!
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,10,"I'ts a Masterpiece of veery good cinematic experiance...Those people who wrote that it sucked balls from an old cow and then squeez it in to ur face, muhahahah.... ...
Com'on , grow up !!! This film is one Of the One Of A Kind!!!!!!!!Peace.. ‚úå"
" Fascinating & Well Done
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,10,"I'm finding all of these angry reviews of ""Interstellar"" mildly amusing. Lots of know-it-all wannabe scientists pointing out absurdities and plot holes. First off, this is not a documentary but a work of fiction. It is not being taught in schools as part of a science curriculum. Lol. So everyone can just relax on that point.What we do get is a beautiful film with touching storylines and an exploration of intriguing scientific ideas, many of which are supported or at the very least, have not necessarily been ruled out as impossible. If you don't believe me, search Neil deGrasse Tyson's views on the film."
" Just a masterpiece
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,10,"I really can't find enough words to describe this masterpiece. I've seen the movie so many times and every time I feel amazed. The script, the sound, the actors, the effects, the quality and the details are trully incredible. I felt in love with the music of the film, thanks to the unique music talent of Hans Zimmer. A must-watch movie."
" Best film I have ever watched
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,10,"As NASA, this film is the best realistic theme about space. Every moment in the movie are very thoughtful,"
" One realistic as best as what knowledge we have about special relativity.
",2019-02-14 00:00:00,9,Being interested in Space Time and the effect gravity would have on space time it was a great movie to watch.
" Not a big fan of the underlying message
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,6,"Love saved the universe.
Love.
I'm fine with the idea of love being a powerful emotion, but as a sci-fi, especially a quite serious one with well-respected scientist as it's scientific advisor, it is quite cringy to have personal love as core of human survival in a cruel universe."
" The Greatest movie I've ever seen. Period.
",2019-02-11 00:00:00,10,That's all I have to say the best movie I've ever seen in my 21 years of living
" A movie in space that actually makes scientific sense
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,10,"I am no fan of Christopher Nolan. In fact I hate most of his movies. However, his work on this film is exceptional. The twists and turns throughout the movie are thrilling. The VFX are not only amazing, but in many ways groundbreaking. I began watching this movie expecting to hate it and by the end I thought it was brilliant. There are many unanswered questions at the end, and a few stretches of what is plausible and what isn't, but when you are dealing with black holes, do we really know what is and isn't possible?"
" A masterpiece.
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,10,"I have never made a review on here before but I feel like this movie deserves it. I have seen it multiple times (30-40) and it never fails to excite me. I get sad, happy and angry when watching this movie. Even though I've seen it so many times it still gets those emotions brewing. I love this film from all of my heart and I believe that I'll never see another movie of this caliber. 10/10"
" Best movie I've ever watched
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,10,"I was born to love everything about space, planets, blackholes etc. I've seen many movies that related to the universe, and this is the only one that actually obeyed every physical law.But the most improtant thing is, for the first time in forever, this movie described the real look of the Blackhole, showing the beauty and elegance of the eternal place of mistery.Music is great too. It's been 4 years since I watched the movie, but I still enjoy listening to the background music in the movie.Love Christopher Nolan, love Hans Zimmer."

" The music alone deserves an Oscar
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,10,"I never thought I'd live to see the day when I'd regard another SCI-FI movie higher than I do Aliens. Well that day has come.Despite the glaring flaws in the plot, it's still an amazing movie. The acting from the entire cast is so astonishingly consistent, but Mathew just knocked it right out of the park. Move over Pachino/Deniro, what Mathew accomplished here is beyond pretentious head wiggling and moving your eyes from side-to-side every 3 seconds, it's more than just persona, it's pure and flawless emotion.The music - An equally impressive masterpiece. It transcends the normal boundary of mere storytelling and fiction, it intoxicates you with this feeling that you are connected with the prowess and struggles of man-kinds greatest accomplishments. Intensely powerful, yet extremely divisive in illustrating the gravity of what is happening.So extremely rare that both the movie and the music live up to each other, especially at such a high standard. But this culmination is why I think Interstellar is the best Sci-fi movie ever made. It also ranks quite highly on my list of best movies ever made.Hans Zimmer and Mathew.M both deserve Oscars for this."
" A Great and Crazy Ride That No One Wants to Take
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,9,"Watching this movie with an open mind is best best thing to do. its nothing like you would expect.

" Epic
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,7,"Epic story spanning decades for some but mere hours for others. The story starts when the dust bowl has returned, just as it was. The relativity calculation for gravity is wrong though. If gravity was so strong to make minutes be years, they would be crushed on the surface. Same with the black hole. It would crush all and the whole universe life would have passed before he could come out. Still good effort for the rest of the physics laws."

I like cast choice, Anne Hathaway was amazing but Matthew McConaughey was better. Michael Caine was good for supporting character. Special effect, soundtrack was amazing!

" Gravity wins seven Oscars and this wins one?
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is simply on another level. It doesn't pretend to be an accurate representation like Gravity, because it knows it's a fantasy. With that out of the way, the director was able to flesh out a brilliant storyline, instead of trying to portray itself as some sort of documentary like Gravity does. Gravity is a fun roller coaster ride no doubt, but it's woefully overrated."
" A Cult classic!! A masterpiece!!! Perfection redefined.
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,10,"Cristopher Nolan, Hans Zimmer Take a bow sirs, A cinema can not be made better in any sense whatsoever than this masterpiece creation, I have seen a lot of movies and will keep watching them till I live, But as far as I am concerned a movie cannot overtake Interstellar in any sense,anyhow.Graphics, cinematography,concept,visiuals, practicality of space, it's technically not possible for any movie to surpass this creation in any sense , it is unarguably the best movie ever created in the centuries to come, this movie should be placed way above Shawshank redemption.
Viewers warning: This is a very technical and conceptual movie which is not for everyone and it's easy for me to say unless you are a scientist or from space field it would take some repetitions and some good internet research.Be it the use of binary messages,String theory,warmhole,time dilation,fifth dimension physics,relativity, gravitational singularity,customised tessarect and many more...As far as the music is concerned hands down the best soundtrack created ever it's my personal choice though and personally I haven't ever come across such an enthralling piece of music art BGM personifies and gigantically improve the visiuals forming perfect blend.All in All in All a movie can't be made any better than this ,I personally consider Interstellar to be one of the pieces of art which is made once in a lifetime. Please view this it's literally once in a lifetime experience."

Especially the second half of the movie is really intense of emotions and the final is simply great. I don't give 9 stars because in my opinion the dialogues are not brilliant, like in other Nolan's movies."
" Banal trip through endless cliches
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,1,"I have read and watched sci-fi books and films for almost sixty years, starting in the 40's with such titles as ""Thrilling Wonder Stories"" and eventually ""astounding Science Fiction."" Regarding this contribution, ""Interstellar"" to the list, it is without the slightest shadow of doubt that I count it as absolutely the worst movie in the genre I have ever had the misfortune to watch. The characters are wooden, the pace is like a snail trying to move through molasses, and trivial or improbable comments are promoted as though they were profound realizations. The basic premise is, in a certain debatable sense, philosophical, mixed with a lot of impressive-sounding technospeak. Things are represented as sudden inspirations which should (and would) have been understood long before the journey even begins, as though to remind the viewer that the protagonists are intelligent and clever enough to figure out what in a real world they would have known and taken for granted long before. Seeing all the grovelingly positive reviews, I tend to classify the film as a con job designed to impress a certain kind of viewer with already understood cliches so as to confirm that they are after all as smart as they think they are. Science is a wonderful tool, but it cannot touch the reality of life, and should not represent itself as though it can."
" The Breakthrough Sci Fi Movie of the Decade
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,10,"8 November 2014. Interstellar (2014). What stands out in this movie is the role of emotion and how the script introduces a fascinating ""long-distance"" relational component of parent-child interaction unlike those movies with a similar powerful, intense, and emotive impact found in the horror movies of Jennifer Connelly's performance in Dark Water (2005), Radha Mitchell's performance in Silent Hill (2006) or John Cusack's performance in 1408 (2007). Interstellar is today's version of the 1950s sci fi classic Forbidden Planet (1956) in storytelling, big scale, and special effects, perhaps rivaling 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) of the sixties, or the sci fi monster thriller hit of the1970s Alien (1979) in its scale and authenticity or the inspirational, newly presented idea film of the last decade of the super hit Avatar (2009). The interweaving of two story lines in this movie was also a huge editing and script challenge that was well handled and presented on screen. Interstellar is solid story telling with its dramatic but not overly stylish Hollywood gloss and glamour as of say Avatar or Forbidden Planet. Even Ann Hathaway's under-stated surprisingly diminutive performance stands out as a directorial and acting highlight considering Hathaway's bigger than life screen presence and public popularity of the past that enhancing the impact of the movie.The overall direction and performances in this movie are introspective and authentic in their approach much like that found in the sci fi drama Stranded (2001) or Apollo 18 (2011) that don't rely on big screen stereotypical theatrics to wow its audiences. Somehow this supposedly epic sci fi adventure is as intimate as Cloud Atlas (2012) was as large spanning literally hundreds of years. Unlike a number of other review references comparing Interstellar to the visual style of sci fi action thriller Inception (2010) or some brief resemblance to Gravity (2013), Interstellar seems to take more from the sci fi relational drama Upside Down (2013) and the sci fi space drama Elysium (2013). As for plot outline, one can argue that Interstellar has more in common with the sci fi mystery of Oblivion (2013) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968 ) especially with noted theoretical leading astrophysicist Kip Thorne as scientific consultant and executive producer. And in contrast, the minimalist music score is in departure to A Space Odyssey's dominating and sometimes haunting musical score. This mind twisting experience includes pieces of the emotion and twisting, off balance characteristics of D√©j√† vu (2006).Some might complain about the extended dialogue, there really is a more satisfying exchange of relevant thoughtful ideas during this movie that are interspersed among amazing special effects that are leading edge for our literal time and space. When it comes to cerebral and emotive impact, Interstellar does so in a more narrative, mystery drama fashion as Ender's Game (2013) hit the similar points using a war action, adventure motif. The sci fi television mini-series The Triangle (2005) brought many of the intriguing and suspense aspects in a lower budgeted, popular mass audience approach, but also indicating how Interstellar was presented in a quality, big budget, high definition big screen format with a corresponding mesmerizing impact. What makes Interstellar so markedly ground breaking is director's Christopher Nolan's leap with this movie in its freshness and significantly different visual presentation, its tight editing and retention of the human relational importance while also presenting to dual track story outline in seamless and meaningful power way. Interstellar recalls the similar breathing mind-bending experiences in Brainstorm (1983) with Natalie Wood and Christopher Walken. Contact (1997) with Jodie Foster and also co-starring Matthew McConaughey, the children's version of A Wrinkle In Time (2002), the otherworldly time altering classic of Slaughter-House Five (1972), the haunting alien ambiance of Solaris (2002)."
" Literally the worst film I've ever seen.
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,1,"The good: impressive special effects, interesting robot characters.The bad: dodgy science, meandering implausible plot, bad editing and pacing, dubious acting.The ugly: horrific dialogue, incomprehensible character motivation, nonsensical and massively contrived story, plot holes so wide you could push Saturn and its rings through.When one astronaut has to use a bit of paper to explain to another, en route, what a worm hole is -- despite it being their goal for a mission decades in planning -- you know you're in trouble.We wanted to walk out halfway through, and in retrospect wish we had, it only got worse."
" A very good story
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,10,"First, very very good music as it blends perfectly in with the movie. You go into some sort of trance as it all binds it all together perfectly. The story is magical as it weaves in most aspects in life such as love, death, hope, faith, progress, technology etc... If you like the movie you probably like the the making of documentary as well."
" Entirely Non-Stellar
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,1,"How could a movie cost $165 million to make while devoting only 5 bucks to a script? I'm no physicist so I'm not going to cry about the faulty science. But at least try to create scenes and dialogue to make the mumbo-jumbo somewhat plausible in a ''suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride"" kind of way. Instead, we're treated to a scene when the astroclowns are freshly in space and through the wormhole when one guy decides to break out the pencil and scratchpad, whereupon he discovers for the first time that every hour down on Planet Moonbeam = 7 years on Earth, so hurry back, mkay?
The ridiculously cumbersome robot. Mumbling Matthew's horrific hairpiece. Anne Hathaway's punchable face. Casey Affleck's even more punchable face. Michael Caine cashing another cheque. All the un-earned tears. The cheap references to Robert Frost and Joseph Conrad. Aaarrrrrgghhhh.
The pretentious philosophizing brings to mind other pointlessly dull movies: Kubrick's 2001 and both versions of Solaris.
Must have been a wild ride at the 3D Moviedome because on television it's a cheap, ponderous melodrama.
Nolan is quickly shaping up to be the most over-rated director since M. Night Shamalamadingong or, more to the point, Andrei Tarkovsky."
" Masterpiece.
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,10,"Let me take a moment to explain my connection to this incredible film. While getting my undergrad at Ohio State, I took a class dedicated in its entirety to Black Holes. This was in 2014, and the semester perfectly coincided with the release of this film. Although I've since gone on to enter the business world, this was my favorite class of my undergraduate tenure. I had the privilege to learn from a professor who was required to take a couple of weeks off to attend a summit in Chile, as he was one of the few people on the planet qualified to work on and analyze the Hubble telescope. We spent an entire week dissecting the metrics of the film's central black hole, Gargantuan; it's spin, mass, and charge. My textbook? Authored none other than Kip Thorne, who was also the Executive Producer of this film. Kip, as you'll see in the trivia section on IMDB, had the immense task to keep all aspects of this film within the grasp of our current theoretical realm. Although elements of this film fringe on the very edge of scientific theory, the overall scientific elements of it are sound, which is why I respected it so greatly. It is a perfect converging of Hollywood and Science. This film came at the perfect time for me, and capped my favorite educational course I have ever taken, albeit far from the professional path I would end up taking. Please dismiss the campy elements of the film, perhaps realizing they simply add ""gravity"" to the plot! One of my favorite movies of all time, if you have any interest in the deep recesses of space and the *truly* unknown (as humanity has no grasp of what surrounds the central plot of this film), I encourage you to watch, and rewatch, this cinematic adventure."

" I created an account for this
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,10,"Let me just say that I have never ""reviewed"" any movie before, good or bad. This movie is neither, it is *absolutely breathtaking*. I have never seen a movie that combines music and visuals so perfectly, i have never seen a movie where the details are just so presize, and I have definitely never seen a movie where after watching for the fifth time, the goosebumps and thrills keep me near speechless for so long. I just finished watching this movie for the fifth time and I will wait for the day that there will be a movie to surpass this masterpiece."
" Amazing
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,9,"In the middle of Interstellar, Nolan tells us that an hour of time on Earth is 7 years in the Earth's time. Hans Zimmer's ""Mountains"" was selected specifically for the landing scene on the planet, focusing on Zimmer's background music in the submerged environment of the planet, You'll hear beats like clock beats like a countdown to something, between every minute and the other 1.25 seconds, keep ticking in the background continuously throughout the scene, until the emergence of the giant wave!
With a calculation you will find that every accuracy you hear is equal to a full day on earth. DetailsDon Oussama"

",2019-01-07 00:00:00,10,"A phenomenal film. The plot is incredibly emotional, beautiful, and thrilling. The action is spectacular, the film is visually amazing, emotional, and superbly acted, with great performances from all (McConaughey is perfect), and MacKenzie Foy, Jessica Chastain, and Ellen Burstyn (who all play the same character at different stages of her life), are perfectly portraying the same personality. It's not perfect, but Christopher Nolan has produced another masterpiece. He is truly incomparable. A notable point about this film is that the emotion is so impactful while the action is so thrilling."
" Best Sci Fi Film of all time
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,10,"I'll avoid spoilers but this is Christopher Nolan's finest work by a long shot and it's probably the high water mark of the genre (which is saying a lot).The cinematography is astounding, the score is amazing. Nolan consulted with theoretical physicists making the ""science"" behind the ""fiction"" more believable than almost anything Hollywood has done. The in depth discussions on how gravity affected time was great for example.The drama unfolds perfectly and Matthew McConaughey gives the performance of his career. Damn the guy has come a long way since his romantic comedy days.This movie is flawless. See it."
" A Extraordinary Movie!!
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Best Sci-Fi Movie Of All Time.
The acting,story,visual effect,everything is amazing!!
I love the way how Nolan playing with our logic sense with the stories he delivers.
Just watch it by yourself,believe me..this is a story you won't ever forget."
" Gold standard for science fiction
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,9,"The strong performances, the gripping story and the heart wrenching reality of inter-steller space makes it one of the best Science Fiction ever.
The near correct depiction of wormholes and blackholes (thanks to Kip Thorne) makes me wonder what it took to make the Studios agree to it. But it definitely adds to the beauty of the world created by Nolan brothers along with the masterfully crafted and breathtaking special effects and Zimmer's ear-soothing music.
Each time I watch this movie, it fills me with awe. And to be honest also kind of spooks me about the vast emptyness surrounding our planet Earth."
" My favourite movie
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,10,"This movie is amazing. I love that it is not a love story between Dr. Brand and Cooper but between Cooper and Murph. And the score is BEAUTIFUL. Hans zimmer is in my opinion the best modern composer ever. Great acting, great visuals, and I always cry in the end."

" Sometimes out of the ashes... a masterpiece is born.
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar is not just a film but a historical accomplishment that will forever be remembered. Firstly, director Christopher Nolan has chosen incredible actors. The story is perfect, you don't even realise how long the movie is until you finish it. Secondly, the music. Gracefully played by the remarkable German musician, Hans Zimmer, the interstellar soundtrack left an outstanding addition to the film. The story was beautifully woven together (again I acknowledge Nolan and his crew) when cooper leaves earth-- and his father, son and daughter, his daughter in particular wants him to stay-- to find a new home for the planets inhabitants. He discovers that they were not meant to return to earth but rather start their own colonization on a new planet. Overall, cooper and his accomplices in space travel through wormholes/blackholes and at one point at the end, cooper seems to be doomed to die, he enters the ""5th dimension"". Where seemingly he can communicate with his daughter on earth. In the end he is saved by oher travellers and brought to a space station where he sees his daughter one last time --in space time has traveled slower for cooper then on earth and his daughter is much older than him. But an incredible story with a fascinating plot. I will never forget this film."
" Good Directors do not (necessarily) make good writers
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,1,"Some directors can pull of the feat of writing and directing, Tarantino comes to mind. PT Anderson is another. Even though this was co-written between Christopher Nolan and his brother, the Coens they are not!This movies is a perfect example of how making a movie (as my amateur film maker friend put it) is like building a cathedral. Being good at making stain glass does not make you a good brick layer, and that task is best left to ones who know what they are doing. To whit, we have this monstrous piece of pretentious drivel which attempts, as so many big hollywood movies do, to gloss over hastily written sequences with flash and bombast. This is another movie that feels like it was written by a committee of executives who were barely aware of the history of film and watched a couple of youtube videos on The Grand Unified Theory and tried to write something all smart-like. This movie is so scattered and convoluted it's hard to begin, and many other reviewers have pointed a lot of the plot elements that are glossed over with yet another ""yeah, that happened, deal with it"". Here are some of the things that I audibly groaned over:Why not explain what happened to Earth when every other part of this movie is explained like the audience is 5 years old?If the technology is available to build spacecraft with cryogen chambers, how about producing new forms of food? Lab grown meat for example? Hydroponic greenhouses etc?Why are the robots basically mechanical jenga pieces? How does that design make sense? The robot REALLY bothered me, especially how there was absolutely no effort to actually make it sound like a robot, it basically sounded like exactly what it was, which most of the time was just a guy inside a cheap plastic box. His voice didn't even sound like it was coming out of a speaker. HAL sounded like a person, but still had a creepy quality to him that sounded vaguely artificial (""what a moment, wait a moment"").And then there is the idea that you could actually get anywhere near a black hole (let alone wormhole) with relatively recent technology and survive. I have a rudimentary understanding of physics, but even I know that the radiation would turn you into goo pretty fast, space suit or no space suit.And a guy waits in a spaceship for 23 years by himself and doesn't go insane and looks basically the same except for a few grey hairs in his beard? I could go on and on....This movie tries really, really hard, there is a lot of balling actors showing off their chops and trusting that they are making a masterpiece, which I imagine every actor must do, but alas there is no saving this movie. It tried too hard to be all things, part 2001: A Space Odyssey, part Armageddon, part Inception and fails on all counts. Everything about this movies hints at greatness, the effects, the Phillip Glass like score written by Hans Zimmer, the tears swelling up at climactic scenes, but it is all empty packing around a bad story. This movie is a shiny car with hamsters on a wheel as the engine.One positive outcome of this movie is that it has reminded me to read about physics out of interest, but not to discuss them like I know anything, as I will come across as pretentious as this movie.I suggest everyone watches 2001 to cleanse their pallet and to be reminded of what truly great film making is about."
" Shocking Movie
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,8,This movie was a very bold and different movie but it was incredibe! Whenever there was something dangerous going on it really pulled you in and made you feel really intense and because its a standalone movie we have no way of knowing what happens to the characters. However the movie felt quiet slow and it took far to long for them to even get into space and probably shouldn't have been as long as it was.
" Interstellar Not A Smeller
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,8,"Movies that revolve around time travel can be annoyingly complicated and confusing. ('Arrival', 'Looper', About Time', 'Time Traveller's Wife', etc). Interstellar is not. Infact, it is a surprisingly thoughtful and intriguing science fiction pic with a star studded supporting cast of contemporary Hollywood actors that willl keep you riveted to the screen even at 2 hours and 49 minutes. McConaughey offers a subdued and mature portrayal of a father choosing between his children and their future. Gone is the swagger and annoying aplomb that we've come to expect in an endless array of rom coms. It's the fully established relationships that keep you grounded in a story that could easily overwhelm and set you adrift in mind blowing science fiction concepts related to advanced science, technology, spaceflight and time travel. The effects are spectacular (as we expect today) but without being overbearing or distracting. There are some fun surprises so get out the extra large popcorn but go easy on the soda pop."
" Required several viewings

" Absolute masterpiece
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,10,"This is my favorite film of all time. I'm a bit of a space geek so I may be a tad bit biased but the sheer wonder and mind numbing effect you get from contemplating some of the concepts and theories tackled in the film is the best part. Yes, Nolan's take on black holes may be a bit hard to digest at first but so is ""Spaghettification"" so that's okay, it's a movie not a real life documentary! The acting is superb, the CGI space scenes are so well done, and the music really ties it all together. 10/10!!"
" One of top movies you have to watch
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,10,"OMG! It's so fantastic! Just awesome!
The actors made all their best! Great job!
I was enjoying all the time of watching.
Highly recommend"
" One of the best movies.
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,10,This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I can watch it over and over. I love scifi movies
" An Absolute Masterpiece of Cinematic Art
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,10,"The other reviewers have said it far more eloquently than I.I've viewed it perhaps over three dozen times. The complexity is astounding! Every aspect of the film, from the story line, script, acting, music and editing is a Magnum Opus for the Nolan brothers.IMHO Interstellar equals and perhaps surpasses 2001 as one of the finest, most mature and most important science fiction films to date."
" A perfect movie on love and faith
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,10,Great movie to watch. This movie perfectly symbolises the relationship of love and faith. A typical Christopher Nolan flick. This movie has all the ingredients to keep you on the edge of your seats and will give you goosebumps. The background movie by Hans zimmer suits the situation. Perfect movie with great acting and gripping story. Must watch
" This film is a bomb!
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,10,"I have never seen such a good film, when it finished I was siting about 10min. and thinking about what i just saw."
" The best science fiction film I've ever seen!
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,7,"It's a great movie. I recommend it to young, old everyone. It's definitely a movie you should watch."
" Great in the first half; less so in the second.
",2018-12-19 00:00:00,6,"In the near future, the planet Earth is disintegrating environmentally. A team of astronauts explore outer space to check if there is another planet where Earth's remaining inhabitants can be transported in order to survive.The first half of the film is fascinating. It has great ideas about what the future might be like considering the current levels of greed and over-population. There is also much adventure in the space mission and the right amount of sentiment of a family being separated. Matthew McConaughey shows brilliance and depth in a scene where he quietly shows how much he misses his loved ones. Playing his school-age daughter, Mackenzie Foy is no slouch either.The second half is interesting at best; muddled, too busy and overlong at worst. There is also a major characters whose fate is left unknown to the point of almost being trivialized.The movie is good in many ways but had the potential to be more."
" The best of all time
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,10,"Master piece for Christopher nolan and hans zimmer and matthew maccgonahy, directing and acting and music, it deserve the no 1 from shawshank, it was perfect to see this movie, nothing can reach me like this movie üòä"
" Mind blower in literal sense
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,9,Another piece of art by Christopher Nolan. If you liked inception and like space and sci-fi then must watch thing
" The fine line between clever and dull and weird...
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,4,"Watched it with the Mrs and whilst we would enjoy many films in the top rated list - this one passed us by. Long, boring, weird, trying to be clever - all come to mind I'm afraid...
It's a Marmite film - though I like Marmite and didn't like this :-)"
" 2nd time around
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,6,"1st time I watched it, I didn't know what to think. The 2nd time a few years later. Hmmm I would say, a bit slow and long. That's the huge downfall. You need to be in the right mood to watch it. The actors, OMG it's a huge cast!!!!!! All in all it's not a 8.6 out of 10. It's somewhere in the 6s, because you have to be in the right mood and have a lot of time on your hands."
" Favorite Movie...
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,10,Ever... A millennial cult classic! And the soundtrack!!! Hans Zimmer & Christopher Nolan together... total legends.
" Really Slow
",2018-12-12 00:00:00,1,Not recommended. It goes on and on. 2001: A Space Odyssey was a lot better IMO.

" Awesome, really, but very big problem
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,7,"First of all this is an awesome movie. The idea is great and entertaining and has spectacular pictures.
Unfortunately there was one thing I could not understand:
3(!) for terrible acting. Actors visit other galaxies meet black holes surf on edge of time and it seems like they just care about there family all the time...what the hell is going wrong there??? They don't even wonder ""woooow black hole in front of me"" like they do this every day omfg this is not to be meant star trek"

Greatest movie all of time..!"
" A masterpiece
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,10,"I have seen at least 300 movies and I've wanted to write a review on IMDb for some time. I guess it's normal to begin with my all-time favorite movie.I actually watched this movie when I was 14 at the cinema, so I didn't really understand much of it, but I loved it. Of course, being my favorite film, I came back to it multiple times, getting more and more into it with every view.I'll start with the effects. They are amazing. From the dusty landscapes of a pre-Armageddon Earth to the breathtaking imagery of an unknown space, the movie always kept me on the edge of my seat no matter how many times I've watched it.Interstellar is yet another masterpiece of Hans Zimmer when it comes to soundtrack. The amazing music worked perfectly with the idea of interstellar travel and this time the great composer outdid himself.The emotional conflict the main character could be compared to one leaving his family to live abroud somewhere far away and never being able to return. Even though early in the film, the connection between Cooper and his daughter didn't seem to be so strong, by the end I couldn't restrain myself from crying at multiple scenes.I know many people say that the physics in Interstellar are really beside the point. I can only tell them one thing: you are right, but that doesn't mean the movies is bad. A Sci-fi movie must not necessarily be scientifically correct to be entertaining. I personally didn't ask myself that many questions on the mechanics behind the movie, because there's no point in that. I only watched and thought to myself afterwards if that could actually happen. Anyway if you want to watch something 100% correct, you should look for a documentary, not an artistic movie.Now to wrap it up, I must say Interstellar will surely turn into an all-time classic, so if you haven't already watched it, what are you waiting for?"
" Best movie of all times
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,10,Masterpiece in all waysMusic acting storyline all!!
" Nolan + Zimmer = Masterpiece
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,10,"Nolans' directing and Zimmers' music, I don't think a movie needs anything more, the music along with the wonderful scenes (I don't have more words) is beyond PERFECT"

These are proud man-tears the movie has given me :')
I will only say, it is an experience of a lifetime. Period"
" FASCINATING, INTELLIGENT AND A BIT COMPLICATED.
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movieas part of a project for my English Class!!! I hope you enyoy my review!!
I liked this movie, because i think that the cast was very well and in general the acting was amazing and fits the story context .
My favorite character was TARS ( the robot), because he was very fun and funny in the scenes.
i didn't like Am√©lia, because she went toward the waves and she was annoying, but, the acting was good ( Anne Hathaway did a good role as a dumb person).
I think the plot was cool ( I liked the planets, the other galaxy), but I thought the ending of the movie ( when Cooper discovers that he is the ghost and he saw Murph¬¥s room etc) was confusing.
I loved the special effects, mainly the Black Hole, the Waves Planet, the space, the Ice Planet, the wormhole etc!!! Its very cool and realistic!!!
-Camillaaaaa"
" What a film
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,"It took me 4 years to watch this movie. I don't know why, maybe cause its 3 hours long and I could never find a time. I am so sorry that I waited this long. Interesting, breathtaking and emotional. I was never into this space themes, but this is a masterpiece."
" a hope for man kind
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that there could be possibilities for humanity in space. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" The plot is more significant than you think
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,9,"If you go into the cinema expecting a mix of Star Wars and E.T (which seems the case for a lot of the unreasonable reviewers giving it a 6 or below), then you'll be dissapointed. This is deeper than that.It is a film about humanity's place in the universe, portrayed by a man who makes the ultimate sacrifice of his family life to save humanity from impending environmental doom.The special effects are magical but not overdone, the plot is based on modern scientific theories (and it helps if you understand them- only to a minimal extent).Anybody with an open heart and mind will be moved and amazed.Not for people who think lazer fights in space, or the presence of a little green alien man, are what determine a good film."
" Wow A good one!!
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,8,"Let me start of and say I do not generally enjoy the Sci Fi genre they tend to bore me and I don't enjoy them. I'd heard great things about this film and read good reviews but I still wasn't confident that I'd like it but I decided to give it a go. Wow I was happily surprised Interstellar is a masterpiece and for a 2hour 49minute science fiction film to keep me interested the whole time it must be good!This movie was well acted, well written with a ""Ghost"" twist I never saw coming, the heart wrenching drama gives you all it's got. A fantastic cast that all significantly contribute to the film in their own way every person in this film was really meant to be there and they all did a great job. This film makes you laugh and it makes you cry, there is a tension maintained through the whole film and you really connect with the characters and feel their pain. It's a science fiction drama showing the power and importance of love.
The cinematography was beautiful and really added an extra aspect to the film.The only downside I must say while the film did keep me entertained it was very long and there was about 20minutes or so that I think could have been cut out to make it a bit shorter and possibly more enjoyable.Well done! This is a brilliant film it truely is a good one, if you haven't seen it do your self a favour and sit down and watch it make the time you won't regret it."
" Undeserved ending
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,8,"Saying that love is the answer to the problem of the humankind and even a dimension is an error. I mean, everything in the film is quite scientifically accurate, why did they screw that up? WHY?
However, everything else is perfect. Matthew McConaughey has just won a new fan. There are several scenes where he is alone in front of a camera that with just his expression you can really feal all the emotions and even cry."
" Disappointing
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,7,"Christopher Nolan has always been willing to sacrifice coherence and clarity of action to achieve mood and atmosphere, but that willingness has never been so apparent as in this film.The first two hours of Interstellar achieve genuine greatness, as the film moves seamlessly from dystopian society study to ghost story to 2001: A Space Odyssey tribute to space exploration saga. And then, to Nolan's shame, we finally learn the answer to the ghost mystery, and it guts the plot we've been breathlessly following all along. It's the sci-fi equivalent of ""the butler did it"".I cannot think of a better film that is more let down by its last act.What a waste of a magnificent setup."
" START PULLING YOUR WEIGHT
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,7,"Matthew McConaughey portrays Cooper, a former near astronaut only a daughter (Mackenzie Foy/Jessica Chastain) could love. The Earth is dying from...well it is dying so the government rewrites history books to make the space program fictional, apparently attempting to appease right wing audiences and alienate left wingers...but wait, that's just a bad hook.Based on lines in the dust in the library, Cooper discovers a top secret NASA location near his house (built on ""magnetic ore"" ) in farm country. It seems somebody has deliberately placed a wormhole out in space near Saturn that leads us to another galaxy where there are some earth-like planets...maybe. Yes, in this near future world NASA has been able to solve suspended animation and create a ship to transport people to Saturn and beyond, start colonizing planets and be able to send signals back through the wormhole...but they can't green Mars.Now the science behind it is an extrapolation of what we know and believe theoretically, except for maybe that library scene which I found very very hard to swallow, but it was the climax of the film. It was needed to bring the film full circle. Many people will get lost in the science as they toss around terms. Yes, let's send a robot through the event horizon of the black hole so we can get the missing gravitational data we need to fill the gap in our anti-gravity quantum physics calculation...which we can immediately make into something to transport the human population. I had more problem with the practicality of applying the science then the science itself.They go to one planet landed on by Miller. They called it Miller's planet. Then they go to landed on by Mann, apparently it was a Mann's world too. Not to reveal more than the trailer, The question in the film is about how much would an individual sacrifice to save the species in the future. The underlying question screams about how we are killing the planet for the future, but are not willing to sacrifice anything in carbon emissions now. Yes, the theme of the film touches on the modern debate of Global Warming and the sacrifice asked of us to stop it and save the only planet we will ever live on for generations unborn.What are you willing to do to save the world for generations unborn?Worth while view for the science and Omni crowd...others do so at their own risk.Parental Guide: No sex or nudity. 2 F-bombs for the kids. Thank you Christopher Nolan"
" Best of the Best
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,10,Space travel are one of my favourite movie category. But this is whole new level to perform it. one word could describe the movie would be masterpiece. Highly recommend to who still not watch it.
" Exceptional
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,8,"This is a very good film, if not great. I found the final segment, when Cooper basically explains the film's meaning(s) to no one in particular (meaning the audience), to be condescending and annoying. Other than this, it is very good. That said, I don't think it even compares with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", which Stanley Kubrick began making exactly 50 years before this film was released. The ""IMDB Top 250 Films"" list, which has almost every Christopher Nolan film he has made in the top 50 (not his fault) doesnt have a single film made by Stanley Kubrick in the top 50. This speaks volumes as to the caliber of amateur ""film critics"" (myself included) to be quite ignorant, in my opinion. So, this film was a letdown for me, but what was I expecting after the same director that made 3 films about ""Batman"", a comic book character (all in the top 50 of course). To show my objectivity, I think his film ""The Prestige"" to be brilliant; my favorite amongst Mr. Nolan's body of work. I gave it 7 stars, and I am being generous."
" 4 stars for stunning CGI
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,4,"American pathetic social conditioning about ""American Families"" again. Everyone is emotional, crying, love each other and bonds are tight. I want to puke!"
" Utter disappointment
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,3,"I just saw the 70 mm version of the film (I hadn't seen it before) and I had high hopes of it. After all, in many reviews it was compared to the Holy Grail of science fiction, Kubrick's 2001: Space Odyssey. But instead of cosmological Beethoven I saw a rather ordinary rock'n roll space movie.Sure, many scientific facts were correct and special effects ok, but the athmosphere of the movie collapsed to the normal cliches of Hollywood movies. The hero was a rough corn farmer turned into a space cowboy. The end was underlining and giving all the answers instead of rising any questions. Driving of the space ships seemed to be rather easy feat, and surely you got those chases with them with some explosions, too...Perhaps the worst thing in the movie was the complete failure of painting the space as a huge place where we are just tiny grains of sand. In Kubrick's Space Odyssey even the journey to Saturn was an extreme journey taking the whole movie to complete. In Interstellar humans are jumping to other galaxies in just minutes of movie time. In other solar systems the journey between planets is not even worth showing... What's the hurry? Instead of describing the feelings of crew in the middle of nothing there seems to be always a great hurry to the next scene of action...After a couple of hours I almost fell asleep. Only when our space cowboy entered the black hole did the movie turned into something of bit interesting, but just when it would have been a terrific spot to end the movie it just went on until the ridiculous end."
" Overrated
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,8,"If you like astronomy sci-fi movies you can watch this movie. I recommended. But I think ""The Martian"" is really better than this :)"
" Like a good wine
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,10,"This movie is like an ageing wine...each time i see it, it gets better, and better, and better..."
" A visual and emotional masterpiece.
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,10,"I watched the movie when it was released at the cinema, 4 years ago. I was mesmerized by the visual effects, the acting, the soundtrack.. I was however perplexed when leaving regarding the story. I thought the movie was confusing (especially the ending) and I couldn't understand the key moment, certainly due to a lack of focus (you're taken aback by the visuals!)I watched it again tonight, and I can safely say that it is also a masterpiece in story telling. The visuals were still impressive, the acting phenomenal, the soundtrack - while loud was powerful and beautiful... And I understood the story this time - I was more focused. It made me cry twice!Impressive work by Nolan (I liked most of his movies except Dunkirk), definitely a classic.
Maybe some reviews were bad due to the first viewing, as watching it requires you to be slightly more attentive to fully grasp the concepts. (prior knowledge of physics isn't compulsory but it helps).10/10"
" Nolan's masterpiece with the best soundtrack ever.
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,10,"This Nolan's partnership with Hans Zimmer was simply great.
Interstellar is an incredible, astonishing movie that is so much more than a common ""Space story"". It shows a relationship between a father and a daughter, filmed with subtlety, with delicate camera movements... And while everything happens, music creates tension and gives extra emotions to the storyline.
Catchy, brilliant, unique."
" Watched Multiple Times Over
",2018-11-08 00:00:00,10,It's pretty good ngl and bc its saying its a short review then ill just write abount the memes of interstellar

" Great movie and acting
",2018-11-07 00:00:00,7,Really enjoy this movie and have seen it a few times. BUT the sound mix is all wrong. Music too loud and talking too soft. If you turn it up to hear what people are saying you then get blasted with the music. Really needs remixing.
" Interstellar Review
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,9,"So far Nolan has not disappointed. Interstellar is a mind twister. From its beautiful visuals, to its great and superb acting Interstellar is a much watch. The world is coming to an end and Matthew McConaughey (who is easily the best actor in this movie) must try and find humanity a new place to live. Without getting into spoilers definitely check this film out. You will not be disappointed. 9/10"
" Christopher Nolan's greatest film
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,10,"Where do you begin with this film, it's chritopher Nolan's best film. What a film. Gets you thinking all the way through. Greatest soundtrack of any film I've ever seen."
" Best action sci-fi movie ever
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,10,Best action sci-fi movie ever and the best nolan's movie ever either
" Is there a better Sci-fi flick?
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar may be my favorite film. Certainly my favorite Sci-fi movie. It pushes the boundaries of what can be accomplished on film. Christopher Nolan figured out how to tell a compelling story about characters we really care about. There is no wastee scene in this film, no pointless dialogue. The acting is amazing and Matthew McConaughey leads this film with a force. The soundtrack matches the intensity of the story. This is a must watch, full attention, no phone to distract you. It's rewarding though, the type of film that makes you think. I watch this once a year and I never get sick of it. These are the kind of blockbusters we need."
" A science-fiction masterpiece
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,9,"Space travel, astronauts, planets, wormholes, time travel, fifth dimension, action and strong drama, this movie is a true masterpiece."
" Long.
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,9,Don't get me wrong the movie is good but it's pretty stretched out. The movie can also be boring at some points and the ending is well you probably know. The visual effects are fantastic and the twist is pretty good.
" A cinematic masterpiece.
",2018-10-30 00:00:00,10,Christopher Nolan wrote and directed a movie that has merged the fields of art and science in a manner never done before. The film is beautiful and the cast does incredible job and capturing your emotions. Easily my favorite movie of all time.
" One of the best Nasa Movies!
",2018-10-30 00:00:00,9,There's no denying the absolute beauty and spectacle on display throughout this almost 3 hour epic
" Magnanimous!
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,10,Still I don't believe how Christopher got to do all these things! I am in with love his work
" Amazing
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,10,"A thought provoking emotional roller-coaster. McConaughey is superb. If you like sci-fi and know how to invest emotionally in a movie - give it a spin. I can guarantee that, even if you don't love it, you'll finish with an appreciation for the scope of what it tries to achieve."
" Really? What the hell was that ?
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,4,Ok Spoilers!!!!!!First off you never find out what caused earth to ecologicaly so messed up and you never really find out what happens to earth. Additionally where was Mann (Matt Damon) headed to? If Mann was never going to see a human again why did he build his robot to explodeThis simply a bazzare movie. Lots of great acting and visual effects. However the scenes toward the end explaining the ghost made 2001 look normalI understood the science in it but still freaking weird
" Survival Instinct
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,10,One of the best science fiction movies ever made. Everything is almost perfect in this work and if you have a fault I can forgive you. It will become a classic like 2001 but much easier to see and understandable
" After re-watching, it's still a masterpiece.
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,10,"I was so nervous of re-watching this one because it was one of my favorite films from years ago, since it's a pretty long movie, so I worried that this might ruin some things on the revatch. But when I was done, it's still epic in every way and for me it's still one of the best sci-fi films I've seen. Not a huge Nolan fan, but Interstellar was just incredible, emotional and beautiful. The original plot, the visuals, the score, the acting, the writting, were all amazing. The performances were excellent, especially Jessica Chastain, though nothing Oscar worthy. This is an excellent film and an absolute masterpiece of sci-fi films.10/10."
" Epic
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,10,Another masterpiece from Nolan. I love it over inception
" Review after second watch, 4 years later
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,7,"High rated movie, expected with big hype in it's time, as it was (and is) usual with Christopher Nolan movies.
Indeed, it is visual masterpiece, with stellar casting, but I did not see much from title - Interstellar travel was marginalized, actually all it was some half minute wormhole crawling. Scientific part was marginal too, but that was to expect. Instead it, we has some high emotional family drama, combined with heavy 'time dilatation', fifth dimension again, combined with gravity. All it with some goal, but will not go into it to not spoil it.
Sad thing is that all it did not make much sense. There were spectacular shots, landscapes, but our heroes, at least scientist ones made mostly bad decisions. Exception was main character Cooper, just a pilot/engineer. Well, that's what people likes to see, I guess.
Worst part was last 10 minutes. Rushed after about 2.5 hours not always fast paced happenings.
The good: robot was cool.Now, I'm on very strong opinion that only right way is to take more care about our Planet and to keep it habitable, to make it better as is at moment - and that is possible - while interstellar travel is still wild fiction. Even travel to Mars is pretty much it, and just not option for transferring millions - even 5 is too much, really. Why so much movies about moving on places which are far worse than some desert or Antarctic ?"
" Masterpiece
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,9,One of the best movies i've ever seen. Beautiful story line with awesome visuals and vfx. This movie gave me goosebumps which no other movie has ever given me. From the acting to the script to everything about this movie is beautifully made. Just love it.
" Great movie but slow
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,8,"Briliant movie. I think why many were confused watching the movie is that it works hard to give scientific basis for the actions taking place and even tries to make it simpler for the common folk to understand but we are simply not smart enough to follow along with every instance , we just have to kind of hang in there and take some big leaps to understand a lot of the movie. Its damn hard to follow at times. Dazzling visuals with pacing issues. Still great stuff."
" I just love him
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,8,"I just love Matthew McConaughey's acting and voice, I can't help myself with that, I liked the concept even though I was confused at the beginning regarding time-zone and what-was-going-on, the time-traveling-and-time-stretching-part still got me emotional because later on this movie just makes you think about all the possibilities in our existence & world, and all the unknown and yet-to-discover-stuff. 
The end was a little bit too much in my opinion, but I still enjoyed the movie itself"
" Easily one of the 3 best movies of all time.
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,10,"I haven't seen this movie ever since it's release in 2014, which, as I realized a few days ago was a big mistake. I honestly think that this movie belongs in the number one spot regarding sci-fi. The way it focuses on dimensions above our knowledge and awareness is astonishing.You are granted an insight on the 4th dimension, the time as a physical dimension, and how gravity plays probably the biggest role in the existence of the universe and our understanding of time and eternity.The movie combines incredible graphics with a story that may be hard to grasp at first, but during the last third of the movie you are permanently stunned by how all things come together.This works especially well, because everything actually makes sense when you know a little bit about how dimension (1st, 2nd and 3rd) work, which means that this movie alone could be about a true physical phenomena, even though we will never in our life-time be able to prove it.It definitely is a must-watch-movie even if you are not interested that much in sciene, because of it's beauty regarding story, graphics, deeper meaning.People might say that it's a bit too complex to understand if you aren't already involved in the topic but I think that after a little research in forums YOU can aswell see through the plot.For me it's within the best movies ever made, taking my personal number 1 spot for the best movie of all time. Well that's of course subjectiv but I would consider it to be in the top 10 to say the least ."
" Suspenseful sci fi
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,8,"Matthew and Nolan do a great job in this Sci Fi thriller. It's very cinematic and the soundtrack is something I listen to every day on my way to work! The pacing was slow at times, but otherwise a great film."
" Nice one
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,9,"Masterpiece is full of intrigues, this film that enters the history of cinema."
" Epic and spectacular, but with major plot mis-steps.
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,7,"An epic and spectacular journey that after its slow start allows the audience to marvel at the wonder and awe-inspiring aspects of space exploration. However, the plot missteps significantly in the second half before losing itself almost entirely to cater for a nice and tidy Hollywood happy ending. The strong acting and characters deliver enough science and human interest to keep the audience involved, but ultimately, the film runs on too long and doesn't spend enough time up in space."
" Masterpiece
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,10,The whole feeling this film generates is superb...The score is one of the best I've ever heard done by the spectacular hanz Zimmer..The acting is sublime with Matty mac putting out a performance that matches any other world class actor..Its simply perfection..I want sky movies to bring it back in ULTRA 4K
" Not my favorite Christopher Nolan film
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,6,"Interstellar is a well-crafted, deep-thinking film full of amazing visuals and a story that sparks conversation with others, but it's not my favorite Christopher Nolan film. Even though the odd pacing may have been intentional, it made the film seem sloppy to me. There were some parts that they sped through, whereas other scenes seemed to drag on for decades. Objectively, I can appreciate what this film has to offer, but it's not one that I'd choose to own and watch repeatedly."

" Like a fine wine
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,9,Like a fine wine that is full of complex notes and is a pleasure to imbibe this movie is all of those things. It also gets better with age. Just watched it for the fourth time in 2018 on blu-ray and it's even better than the first time I saw it. The story is both contemporary and futuristic and speaks to our human condition and poor custody of our planet. It's also a great thrill-ride.
" I gave up
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,3,"I wanted to enjoy this film but after about 20 minutes of struggling to decode Matthew McConaughey's slurring and mumbling words I was unable to follow it so admitted defeat and gave up. Maybe it's a great film otherwise, I don't know, but if I can't understand what the main character is saying there's no point watching."
" Cosmic masterpiece
",2018-10-05 00:00:00,10,"In a futuristic world where Earth's resources have mostly vanished and people are on the verge of starvation, an ingenious engineer accepts to be sent in a space expedition, hoping to find a new habitable world which to populate. With the promise of return, he's determined to complete his vital mission, but, along the way, he will encounter many obstacles, more and more unexpected and tedious, which will make him question anything he knew about life and time.It's a mind boggling experience which I found simply amazing, no matter the point of view. I was astonished by its complexity and visual effects, let alone its wow inducing facts regarding time and the universe. Its story slowly evolves, going into uncharted territory to my delight, ending after nearly three unnoticed hours with style. Although apparently lengthy, it manages to create a superb cosmic atmosphere, filled with mystery, suspense and tension, boredom being something out of the question.It's simply an astonishing piece of cinematography, thanks to its cast, story and visual effects. The fact that it didn't won much more academy awards simply puzzles me."
" Interstellar, above and beyond stellar
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,10,"After seeing Christopher Nolan's Interstellar it immediately became one of my favorite movies of all-time. The movie had such an impact emotionally on the entire audience. Just as Nolan provided amazing twists and turns in previous films, such as ""The Prestige"" and ""Inception"", he delivers at his best in Interstellar.I first saw this movie on my 18th birthday, I thought it was a great surprise and gift. The music for the motion picture, created by Hans Zimmer, was absolutely incredible. At parts in the movie my heart was pounding and it felt as if it was, in some ways, real life. I love the part (spoiler) when Matt Damon's character dies in the spaceship explosion and Cooper docks to the space station as it is spinning in space, the music gave me goosebumps.This is a story that focuses on family. The main character (Cooper) leaves his son and daughter behind on a space expedition to save the human race. He travels through a wormhole and explores different planets to determine if they are capable of sustaining human life. One of my favorite parts in the movie (spoiler) is when relativity comes into play. A huge wave hits their spaceship and they are stuck on this water planet for over an hour. But due to the gravitational pull on this planet, he ends up spending 23 earth years on it.When he returns to the original ship he had received many messages from his son and daughter. (Spoiler) Over the space of a few hours (his time) he had witnessed his son graduate from high school, get married, have his own son, watch that son pass away, and more. In the end, he returns and his daughter is now an old woman. He promised her that he would come back to her, he fulfilled his promise. This is a very intense and inspiring sci-fi film. It is motivational and teaches us of the importance of family and love."
" Well done Mr. Nolan
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,10,"After 1.2M+ IMDb reviews... here's my review of interstellar. I've seen this movie more than 12 times. I first saw it in grade 7 on a small TV and No other film I've ever seen has had this much of an impact on me as a movie critic and filmmaker. This movie is visually stunning, emotionally-charged, and powerful. I love it more & more every time I see it and it, and it is a masterpiece of our time. If visual storytelling, screenwriting, or music composition is your thing... this is the movie for you! Hans Zimmer has created an emotionally resonant score to hit you in the feels unlike any other film. Christopher Nolan directed the heck out of this movie and did a phenomenal job. The performances are outstanding, life-like, and painfully realistic. This film HAS inspired and WILL inspire filmmakers for decades to come. I understand that many people don't like this movie because it was boring and/or WAY too long, but movies can be for many purposes... you can go to the movies for explosive and mindless fun or you can go to the movies for an emotionally realistic escape into the future with philosophical themes about human connections, love, and perseverance. Interstellar is a masterpiece needing the recognition it deserves."
" Stellar Interstellar!
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,9,Finally got around to watching Interstellar. I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it. From a technical point the film is a masterpiece. Truly stunning CGI and cinematography.The story was had a nice spin on a classic Scifi concept and kept me glued the whole time. Plus it added a few interesting philosophical questions about the nature of humanity and love. As expected From Christopher Nolan directing was outstanding. I'm sorry that I put off watching it for so long. Overall a 9 out of 10.

I think that the movie is okay, i mean visually it was awesome and the music was also beautiful but the writing in this movie is worse than The Room. Nolan is a good director but a bad writer and I really hope that he'll work with a good writer or learn how to write because there's a great potential being wasted here. Anyway I think that the movie is okay and i still have some mixed feelings about it but surely it doesn't deserve to be in the top 250 by any means."

" Best Movie Ever
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,10,"In physics, spacetime is any mathematical model that fuses the three dimensions of space and the one dimension of time into a single four-dimensional continuum. Spacetime diagrams can be used to visualize relativistic effects such as why different observers perceive where and when events occur.Until the turn of the 20th century, the assumption had been that the three-dimensional geometry of the universe (its spatial expression in terms of coordinates, distances, and directions) was independent of one-dimensional time. However, in 1905, Albert Einstein based his seminal work on special relativity on two postulates: (1) The laws of physics are invariant (i.e., identical) in all inertial systems (i.e., non-accelerating frames of reference); (2) The speed of light in a vacuum is the same for all observers, regardless of the motion of the light source.The logical consequence of taking these postulates together is the inseparable joining together of the four dimensions, hitherto assumed as independent, of space and time. Many counterintuitive consequences emerge: in addition to being independent of the motion of the light source, the speed of light has the same speed regardless of the frame of reference in which it is measured; the distances and even temporal ordering of pairs of events change when measured in different inertial frames of reference (this is the relativity of simultaneity); and the linear additivity of velocities no longer holds true."
" A Masterpiece
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,10,"Science Fiction can definitely lead to a bad film... I have names... But this film is the total opposite: it's simply a masterpiece.
The storyline is excellent, the actors are amazing (McConaughey is amazing), they brilliantly play their part. 
It's incredibly moving... please thing about having a Kleenex with you.
It's the story of a man who would die to save his children, but as well for whom this life is not enough. His an explorer, an adventurer, a courageous man and a father. Put all this is your shaker and you get one of the most moving film I have ever watched.

" Absolute.
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,10,"Every single element of this film is pure crafted genius. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack is perfection. The atmosphere generated is to die for, the picture is flawless. This film requires attentive viewers with more than one brain cell. This is probably why there are a fair few reviews complaining about the ""lack of action"", or ""confusing plot"". The fact is, this film has been meticulously planned and thought out. The theory all adds up within reason, so maybe the cynics should look more at their own lack in intellect, over Nolan's. There isn't a single scene that can be simply skipped to make for a quicker viewing. Every second builds the atmosphere, giving hints, making the viewer think, making the viewer feel. If you want an action thriller, go and watch transformers, but if you are willing to put down your phone, and spend 3hrs immersing yourself in to a truly amazing spectical, look no further than this film. The first and only film I will ever review. A true masterpiece. This review is being written years and years late, and I know nobody will probably read this, but upon my 6th time being left in awe at this film, I thought I had to make my opinion known. Absolutely Perfection"
" Ready to say good bye to our Galaxy with Masterpiece of Nolan
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,10,"A general audience may say what the hell was that? What is Tesseract ? Why Docking is so dangerous ? 
So many questions nolan always leaves audience with, but one thing is for sure it makes you watch his film again and again. Not just because of Story, Concept, screenplay, Score, Acting or story line. Every single dialogue is perfectly written which connects All three Acts together so unified that makes nolan different from others.
by watching interstellar you will forget if its a sci-fi, every aspect of film is so realistic until the tesseract sequence you would say its nothing reachable by humans but the truth is its NOT. 
Some hardcore Cosmos Science + Love Emotions + Technology Development only Nolan can put all of these elements in a film together so that even you do not understand some astronomy stuff but you will remain attach to the film.
In the end of every Nolan film it feels like want to see something more as its end is not truly an end but another beginning of a new chapter.
Best Film of this Decade no second opinion about it <3"

They mastered it great. The score was amazing. It made you feel the moment. Hans Zimmer is one of the best composers ever. Sound effects were some of the best. it felt like it was happing right by you. The acting selection was amazing. Matthew Mcconaughey was amazing. He took the film away from the other actors. He was the spotlight of the film. Michael Caine was amazing. He made you cry and smile. Interstellar is a great film. One of the best space movies ever.
" can't be better Sci-Fi movie than this..
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,10,This is really a masterpiece. Kudos to christopher nolan. It really is worth watching many times movie. The only thing you need to keep in mind before watching this movie is to keep presence of mind during whole movie or else you'll miss something.
" A graceful duet of Sci-Fi and Reality
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is a masterpiece of both visuals, science fiction, reality, and story. What makes this movie so good to people, is the fact of how everything is executed. 
The camera work and visuals in Interstellar use both CGI and real word environments. The water planet was not a stage, but actually a glacier in Iceland. The combination of visuals with the props, costumes, etc. are what make this film look so breathtaking. 
The Sci Fi aspect of Interstellar comes mostly into affect when Joesph Cooper (Mathew McConaughey) enters a black hole in the final minutes of the movie. This sends him to what can only be described as a different dimension, that has the ability to bridge both space and time. The nickname for this dimension (but only because it appears in a way Coop can understand and use it) is the space bookcase. The bookcase is the one in his daughter Murph's bedroom. It's here that he can see that the coordinates and things that were laid out for him on Murph's floor to get him into space in the first place was laid out for him, by him. This would constitute as a time loop, but while Interstellar does involve theoretical time physics in its plot, it does not dabble with time travel as a whole concept. This part of the movie is what falls into the Sci Fi genre, in that we don't know if something like this could actually happen. 
The Reality aspect of Interstellar actually involves most of the film as a whole. Most of the science and equations used in it are in fact, real world science. 
Lastly, the story. The story is well written, the dialogue is great, and it defines each character so that each person has their own traits and quirks. 
All in all, everything in this movie gets wrapped up into the beautiful work that is Interstellar. I would strongly suggest this movie, in that it makes you think just a little bit more."

I watched it twice in the theatre just because I didn't really get it fully the first time around and also because it's a great movie experience to be enjoyed on the big screen. I don't think it would have the same impact watching on a smaller TV screen.I have seen majority of Nolan's movies on the big screen and I sincerely think he's an artist that best shines on the biggest canvas.Epic."

After watching this movie tho, i felt so many diefferent feelings when it was over. I got so many ideas of what life actually is. i got curious about space and life and all of that. There aren't many movies that makes me cry either, i think i've cried after watching 3 or 4 movies, and this is at least 2 of them.I think it's just perfect. you don't just go and do something else after watching this movie, you will think and wonder.

The acting is brilliant, the dialogues are well thought through, the visuals are beyond stunning and LOVE GOES ACROSS SPACE AND TIME. There wasn't a time where this movie didn't make me cry. Even if I know what will happen I simply can't help it. It's just one of those movies. It leaves me in a totally another dimension. Even if you don't like sci-fi this movie cannot leave you emotionless. I can confidently say this is my favourite, and I've watched a lot of movies. A masterpiece.

" A Beautiful movie
",2018-09-06 00:00:00,8,"Just for sake, this is not a completely positive review. As much as I love Christopher Nolan's works, I cannot say that Interstellar is his best movie. It's nowhere near a masterpiece film as was The Dark Knight. The Dark Knight and Inception had succeeded in making us understand ourselves better and the true nature of humanity. Interstellar may not do that, but Interstellar does one thing that I feel not many other cinemas have done. It INSPIRES. When i watched Interstellar I was left in awe at the vast glory and beauty of outer space. The ultimate darkness and his mind blowing cinematography. The directing was beautiful, there were not any moments in the movie where I felt the scenes were too long or too short. This movie truly is one of those movies like Jurassic Park where you are left in awe and wonder. What left me completely struck though was the fact that this movie is centralized around the relationship of a father and daughter. I found this concept incredibly smart and beautiful. The music itself is one of the best movie scores of the decade. It captures the emotions incredibly well and I believe that Interstellar is by far one of the best movies I've seen. However, this movie does lack in one place particularly where I thought broke this movie completely from becoming a masterpiece. The pacing. And I mean it, the pacing is poor for Nolan's standards. The movie's sequence of events felt like you were on a road trip and that each planet was a stop for gasoline. Too much time was spent developing Cooper and Murphy as characters in the beginning and little time was spent developing Dr. Brand and the other astronauts. Although the movie centralizes around the father and daughter I felt that some of the other characters weren't given enough importance. There were also a few plot holes in the movie as considering to Dr. Mann's behavior. I feel like that since one hour of the movie was practically spent on Earth developing the father daughter relationship alot of plotholes later on in the movie formed. This really kinda turned down the movie on me and I exited the cinema slightly confused but still struck in awe. The truth is, that even though Interstellar has problems, I don't deny that it truly is a spectacular movie. In modern cinema, I only ever really feel like that Nolan's cinemas have hit the mark of true film making as most other movies coming out nowadays are cheap and full of CGI. But Interstellar truly was inspiring and an awesome experience. I will say that the movie is slightly confusing as many things are unexplained, but it doesn't mean that Interstellar is a bad movie. Me personally I'd rate this movie an 8.4/10 but I can tell you. Watch this movie if you haven't."
" MINDBLOWN!!!
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,10,"Christopher Nolan does it again with another realistic view of the world. Even though this is his first sci fi film it was still done better than most sci fi directors/writers with its accurate depiction of a ""black hole"" and the science invloving outer space and interstellar travel.

" Just a make-up with nothing beneath
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,2,"Irritating level of fantasy slapped together with NASA references (poor NASA).
Plot is hollow, I didn't care for any of the characters (strangely - Mat Damon's was the most 3Dimensional of them all), Bradley Cooper is in his comfort zone as a educated, apathetic, southern redneck. His role, in my opinion, (apart the spiritual BS) hurts this movie the most. It banalizes some truly amazing and inspiring careers - astronaut. In this depiction, only thing that you need is ""to be born for it"" and hard work, education and training means nothing and are completely futile. Of course, children's are magical innocence transcendent time-space.I gave it TWO because of the wasted potential, wrong message ans lazyness in writing."
" Good movie but...
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,8,"It's a good movie but I would like the story to be played from a scientist, or an astronaut (like real astronauts), and plenty of little mistakes in the movie which could be erased or replaced with something else...
Besides that, the actors was great and cgi effects also."
" Stellar only in theme, not in quality
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,3,"This is not going to be a scientific analysis/nitpick-fest of the film. Many things didn't make any astronomical sense, but I can usually forgive these errors (so long as they're not terrifically dense) if a film has good content, emotional impact, or any of the various qualities that make great films great films. This film, unfortunately, did not deliver very many qualities of good film making.As a veteran viewer of Christopher Nolan's films, I wish to open up with his weakest writing ability: characters. The only character that stands out among all of his films is the Joker in The Dark Knight, and that was mostly due to the brilliance of Heath Ledger's acting. Every single one of his characters (besides the Joker) is bland, stale, unexciting, unlikable, unrelatable, and simply banal. There is no lack of character change in his films, as there are certainly events/epiphanies/catharses that cause change in the characters, but the characters themselves, both before and after change, are just not interesting and lack depth. Change alone does not make a character more interesting or notable; there's also what they were before and what they become after to take into consideration. Interstellar is no exception; the characters are fairly one-dimensional. To be specific, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is the typical headstrong, confident, amiable guy, a protagonist type. His daughter Murphy is the average ""lovable cute"" daughter with that special ""connection"" with her father that ends up more or less being what saves the world by the end of the film. Anne Hathaway's character Dr. Brand had a lost love on another planet but other than that didn't offer much to the film.Perhaps a big part of why the characters are not so great is that there is almost always an oversaturation of characters in Nolan's films, so each one doesn't have a lot of time to be developed. Nolan loves to sprinkle in tons of big/medium name actors for near-useless roles, or very small ones. This film is once again no exception; what was the justification or purpose of Casey Affleck's character as Murphy's brother? That was a completely useless throwaway character. Even John Lithgow's character as the grandfather was pretty much unnecessary. And how about Topher Grace's character? Wes Bentley's? Even David Oyelowo's character, beyond helping out with gravitational research, offered very little to the film. There are simply too many small characters, it's hard to even remember them at all, let alone justify their presence in the film whatsoever. Inception suffered from this as well; I personally haven't seen that film since it first came out, and by now I can't even tell you any characters, or what their purpose might have been, beyond Leonardo DiCaprio's and Ellen Page's. I know many of the actors in the film but forgot their characters.It is not necessarily impossible to make a great film without a presence of good characters, but other areas must shine to make up for this lacking. There was plenty of dialog between the characters in this film, but most of it was a vehicle for explaining what was happening in terms of the scientific/relative time aspects. I feel that Inception was the same exact way in this regard; most of the film was spent tiresomely explaining itself, instead of just letting it play out and allowing the viewer to piece it together. Most films that explore sci-fi concepts that are a bit more difficult to follow than the average film, such as The Matrix, Vanilla Sky, and Minority Report, do so without sacrificing over half the film explaining what's happening. These films leave that explanation to a few key scenes, and let the viewer figure out the rest, even if it requires multiple viewings to fully absorb. This time spent explaining the scientific phenomena is precious film time wasted that would have been better spent on advancing the story, developing characters, build-up, or anything valuable as far as film substance. I can appreciate and understand that the film's concepts may be a bit much to swallow for the average viewer, but when a film's runtime ends up being 2 hours and 49 minutes because it needed to explain itself so vastly, this often indicates that there is something severely wrong with either the underlying story or the script, or perhaps both. Is it really worth all that extra time and sacrifice of film substance just to get across what is happening onscreen? Even if it makes the film slightly less accessible, I argue no. Not only that but it's a pretty darn boring way of going about it; the characters are just back-and-forth discussing their plans for most of the entire film. Surely there could have been more interesting ways using the language of cinema to communicate even these complex ideas. To the film's credit, Cooper did once use a whiteboard to diagram part of their plans; little touches like this were much needed in the other areas of the film.Even the dialog that was not self-explaining was rather dull. One of the lines was something like: ""I thought I could watch you suffer and die but I just can't do it"". Why was that even in the film? Why not use cinematography to show his head look away, silently portraying that he can't watch it? The writing in general was just not good, there are plenty more exemplifications than just this.Were the story and overall ideas conveyed enough to outshine the rest of the film's lacking? Unfortunately not. The film begins in a typical modernist viewpoint of a near-future apocalyptic scenario; humans destroyed the planet and need to be offloaded onto another. Most of the film is about exploration and the journeying to find a suitable planet, while possible chaos and total destruction of all humans on earth was at hand. Time travel, fifth-dimensional, and black hole theory were sprinkled in a bit too. The premise and concepts are certainly interesting enough in themselves, but they just weren't used well at all and meshed together rather awkwardly. The scene inside the black hole was trying to be super thought-provoking and ""out there"" and 2001: A Space Odyssey-like but it fell pretty flat. The visuals were fairly interesting but it felt more like a thrown-in aside than an attempt to say anything useful. The only thing I personally gathered from it was that human technology could perhaps one day advance to the fifth dimension. This, sadly, offered nothing for the film itself, and only provided a brief marveling about future technology. To contrast, 2001 was all about these ideas, and the genius of Arthur C. Clarke spoke volumes about galactic travel and technology.The overall message of the film was fairly cheesy; the human idea of ""love"" somehow transcends all physical laws and stands as the One True Concept of our universe, or at least the one that outshines the rest. I could see this idea working but it wasn't portrayed well at all. In fact this message was even outright told to the viewer by the protagonist; once again where is the subtlety here? Certainly the average viewer can gather at least that much.Interstellar was, however, not completely terrible in every way. Hans Zimmer's work on the score was fairly fitting, epic and had a slow, drawn out feel as the film did. The acting was pretty good all around. Of course, I wish the characters were better to make room for better acting, but good performances were delivered for what the characters were. Many of the effects, especially the incessant spinning of the various spacecraft, were fairly well-done and immersive.Finally, to end on the film's best element, the human impact of time relativity on a real person is something that is not explored much even in most sci-fi films. When Cooper sees his children all grown up and learns that his father has died after spending only a few hours on an extragalactic planet, he weeps uncontrollably. This is something that audiences can relate to; this is good film content. This aspect I'd like to see explored more in future films, and perhaps Interstellar shall be popular enough to make an impact within film studios toward this direction, hopefully with better writing and direction in future endeavors."
" Interstellar Underdrive
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,4,"I understand that director / producer Christopher Nolan was reaching for a sort of genre-busting, cross-cultural, auteur-imprint sci-fi blockbuster like ""2001"" or ""Close Encounters"" and so establish himself in the cinematic firmament alongside the likes of Kubrick and Spielberg. Well I'll start by saying that those two particular films are far from my favourites by Stan and Steve and that I struggled to maintain my interest throughout this very long, very sciency movie.It takes an age to get going for one thing, over-developing in my opinion, the relationships between widower Matthew McConaughey, his grounded, land-loving son and reach-for-the-sky genius daughter, at the same time, establishing his own credentials as a brilliant maverick space-pilot, setting us up for the meeting with old prof Michael Caine in another predictable feet-under-the-bed casting by Nolan and his eco-warrior daughter, played by Anne Hathaway, where he learns of the secret plan to reach out to other worlds for possible solutions to the dust-storm crisis on our earth which if unchecked will see the planet's extinction. And so McConnaughey, Hathaway and their small band of brothers hop on a big space rocket to seek out the three most promising of the twelve missions previously undertaken to this end but the only meaningful encounter they have is with Matt Damon's stranded scientist. After an Apollo 13-like miraculous return to Earth, McConaughey gets all discombobulated in the space time continuum as he tries to go back to the original moment he left his daughter to leave her a message to save all the future bother. This circular-time folding-back-on-itself skit has been done before more than once (I can even remember it in a Harry Potter film), thus reducing its effectiveness for me at the climax and whilst I can otherwise see Nolan projecting big issues like faith, forgiveness, guilt, hope, survival, family and of course love, I found the film to be slow-moving and clunky in construction.I wasn't engaged by the main characters and frankly got lost in all the science too while as regards the acting Caine and Damon are badly miscast in my opinion and as for the android which looks like a clothes peg and all that Dylan Thomas ""Do Not Go Gentle..."" guff - we all know it's a great poem anyway. Of course it may just be me remembering my thoughts on its two big-name antecedents but if people out there want to put this on a similar level to those they can be my guest. Not my type of film perhaps but then Nolan didn't do anything like enough here to change my preconceptions either."
" The Perfect Example of how a film should make be
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,10,"This film, this film right here is the perfect example of why watching a film can change your view on something. With the hand in hand music crafted to perfection by Hans Zimmer, no person can watch this film without thinking, ok yeah, this is good. Either the music gets you, the acting or both. The degree of acting that the director of this masterpiece has put together is exquisite and just takes my breath away. Since the first day I saw this movie I knew that it was going to be my favourite movie of all time but I first had to confirm that with my previous favourites and I couldn't put this anywhere but at the top number 1 spot.I haven't seen this film more than any other, I'd sit through every second again, and I do so at least twice a year. I love this film more than words can express and I wouldn't want to put time and effort into another review for any other film, it's pure art."

" A Frozen Cloud of Horse Poopy
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,1,"Dear God, what is this? I could not believe what I was seeing after all the positive reviews. I watched on Amazon video, and thank goodness for that because I would have demanded my money back at a theater.This 'film' is a naked excercise in making an IMAX film for the sake of screwing the public out of more money to... watch it on IMAX. I tell you, having experienced the format live, once you get past the ""gee whiz factor"" of a ginormous screen in your face, it's just a movie. And to further insult my sensibilities it's likely the last IMAX movie to actually use the large format physical film. I'll bet that cost a fortune for three hours of inanity.I thought Nolan was a great director before this. He likely still is but this material is way out of his reach. We don't have any of the 'great' directors anymore in my opinion, but he's one of the very good ones. But when I heard organ music cues at certain points in this movie, I cringed at the Kubrick-ian references. Kubrick would have walked out of this 3 hour morass.The plot holes are akin to a piece of swiss cheese. Good acting is absolutely wasted with trite dialogue and scenery-chewing to the point of choking. Long speeches about love... and other stuff that was supposed to sound monumental and mind-blowing. Ugh. I kept thinking that Michael Caine's character's last lines as he died would be ""...at least I don't have to look at that awful script anymore"". And as events in the film transpired, I was constantly saying ""Wait...what? Huh? How did the - I mean, where... which?"" And of course there's the ""mysterious ending"" that will keep amateur you-tubers in business for years explaining.As far as scientific accuracy, first let me say that I had a whole year of college physics, and have a dear friend who actaully had a master's degree in that subject and had studied quantum mechanics and relativity, and I do I have a conceptual understanding of the matter at hand. This movie really pushes the envelope in that department. All that time dilation stuff is not reconciled properly. Frozen clouds? The film makers went to great pains to point that out as the 'one thing' that wasn't accurate. Oh yeah? I could devote an entire review to that, and I won't.The sad part is that the special effects were 10 stars all the way. The oscar was well deserved. The sadder part is that I smell a sequel at some point. A huge disappontment, a waste of great acting talent, and another case of overblown Hollywood hype gone viral, but come home to roost in the bargain bin at the dollar store. Where it belongs."

The soundtrack of this movie is in my opinion one of the best works of Hans Zimmer.
The film also contains a lot of beutiful shots and leaves us with a question: What will happen to our planet if we are still gonna treat it the way we treat it nowadays?"

" One of the best sci-fi movies of all time
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,10,"I really loved when I watched this movie for the first time, and this move is so complex, deeply and full of details that made me watch 3-4 times to catch all the details and science behind it. It's really a master piece that dragged me into the movie's world. The soundtrack is also amazing, love to listen to it time to time.
Christopher Nolan is a very talented director, wish they could pick him up to direct the new Star Wars movies instead of young and inexperienced directors/writers that Lucasfilm hired for the new trilogy. Christopher Nolan is really the guy who takes time to develop a good story telling and creates a world that just drags you inside it. Interestellar is really one of the best Sci-Fi movies and I really recommend this movie for any Sci-Fi/Space travel fans around."
" Is the Universe Friendly ?
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,9,"According to Albert Einstein, that's the central question any human being should ask themselves in their lifetime; and if ""Friendly"" doesn't sound too science-friendly a term, let's remember that the iconic genius never took science as an end but a means to a humanistic end.Indeed, some secrets about our existence can be more profound and distant than any lone star from the furthest galaxy and perhaps the reason-to-be of science fiction is to leverage scientific speculation with an extra kick from human imagination, liberating a creative energy meant to anticipate the most daring solutions to our most troubling puzzlements... or simply put, to trust the future. Directed by Christopher Nolan (and co-written with his brother Jonathan), ""Interstellar"" isn't set at a time that leaves much for optimism: devastating blights are reducing the Earth resources to nil, dust storms make the air unbreathable and in this suffocating dystopia, even politics and crime became pointless. With a beaten spirit, humanity undergoes the slow apocalypse. But how can anyone be a pioneer or a conqueror again when any part of the world is doomed, when there's no 'West' to go anymore? What's left then is one single desperate measure we owe to a Science-fiction's classic : ""Keep watching the skies!"". One man follows the motto, a Midwest widower and previous ace pilot named ""Coop"" (Mathhew McConaughey). He doesn't know it yet but a scientist did the same, with fruitful results. Professor Brand (Michael Caine) found a ""path"" to a galaxy with potentially inhabitable planets. While it doesn't take the mind of Stephen Hawkins to understand that there would be no chance of survival in any planet of the Solar System, I wish the question of Mars could have been raised at least once.We also gather that the exodus wouldn't be just some fancy cruise and might last a bit longer than the one to the Promised Land, except if you precede years with ""light"", but this is where the interference (so to speak) between the screenplay originating from creative artists and a physicist named Dr. Kip Thorne introduced the fascinating concept of wormholes, sorts of tunnels that can take you from point A to another B within a universe comparable to a piece of paper fold in two, like a pencil cutting through it. And once you consider time as a fourth dimension, you guess the implications.Time travels, space travels, dystopian future, artificial intelligence ... is there one realistic sci-fi concept that ""Interstellar"" doesn't cover? Once again, Nolan proves that he's the star pupil of all filmmakers, and there's only one stardust of sarcasm in an inner space of admiration. I sincerely believe that the film is so ambitious in scale, CGI and practical effects and attention to scientific accuracy that it is beyond any rational criticism. Nolan's wish was a studio's command after the success of his ""Dark Knight"" trilogy, if there ever is one to push the envelope, to be the 'Coop' of cinema, it's Nolan.
But there's one reason why ""Interstellar"" stands above other sci-fi blockbusters... no, not the romantic subplot with Anne Hathaway or Matt Damon's character. At the risk of sounding corny, many things are relative according to science, time is: one hour in a planet can equal 23 years, distance is no better as it can take as much time to jump from a galaxy to another as to travel from Santa Fe to Albuquerque. Still, there's one powerful force that hasn't unveiled all its mysteries and can be everything but relative, the power of attraction aka love power.There's this bonding between Coop and 'Murph' (Mackenzie Foe and Jessica Chastain for the adult version). Murph got her name from the infamous Murphy's law and the 'science-detective' virus and looks for any paranormal manifestation, some she calls ghosts... don't worry, there's an answer to everything and the rational answers provided later could only come from the man who designed the rubik-cube like plot of ""Inception"". Precise and effective, maybe a tad too effective. Nolan sure does this homework but sometimes, he gets so carried away by scientific perfectionism that he indulge to a few moments or lines where it's hard to keep a straight face.But even ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" had such moments. In ""Interstellar"", I think I can sum up the criticism by saying that the film wanted to be many things instead of just one... and Nolan, wanted to make the consummate Sci-fi film, after which every sci-fi film director would ask himself ""what would Nolan do in that case?"". And I guess sometimes, there's nothing wrong with sacrificing realism for the sake of plausibility. Sometimes, I regret Nolan's perfectionism, could he make a movie like ""Back to the Future"" if no scientist could endorse the theory of the flux capacitor? Once again, paraphrasing his greatest character, I want to ask Nolan ""why so serious?"". ""Interstellar"" still touched me for its intelligence of the heart, the way it did answer Einstein question by making us parts of the universe, Earth can stop being friendly, not that divine whisper that made us exist can also figure out how to keep us ""immortal"" and it's all about entering a journey, not with rage, as Professor Brand repeats, but with the sheer conviction that there's got to be a way.Mathematics is the alphabet with which God created the Universe, so all it takes is to break the code through the powerful bonding between two people. Bogart said: ""it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world"". Well, according to ""Interstellar"", the problems of two little people matter a lot in the whole universe, in the great cosmic scheme of things.That's why, for all its visual effects, its Hans Zimmer's score and heart-pounding action sequences, the most memorable part of the film is McConaughey's bursting into tears after seeing his grown-up daughter."
" The best movie ever

" Had this been written by Kubrick, it would have become the masterpiece it intends to be.
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,9,"Had this movie been written/directed by Stanley Kubrick, it would probably have become the masterpiece it intends to be.While I agree this sci-fi/existentialist movie production far surpasses most of what has been produced in recent decades. It's many twists will probably leave some confounded at times, but in general very pleased. Don't get me wrong. This is an excellent Sunday movie, and potentially among the top 10 sci-fi films ever made.It's masterfully cut and directed, with an excellent acting and musical score. it's a crescendo of human emotions and quantum science goes way beyond traditional sci-fi films, usually aimed at showing humans eco conscious side. Lasting close to three-hours, it does not rely too much on its gorgeous cinematic sequences as most sci-fi do.This movie is an excellent and very refreshing take on the typical sci-fi Hollywood plot. It's take on quantum science, relativity, time-space, fifth dimension make this an essential film should be essential for new film makers looking to explore this wonderful genre."

" Attempts to be smart but at the end falls on it's face
",2018-08-14 00:00:00,5,"This movie reminded me of a better one called ""Contact"" (1997) in all the good ways.It starts fairly interesting with a speech about modern society and it's posture about science, information and our final toughts on what's pretty much the dawn of the planet. I also tought that the dust idea was smart and original, instead of using something like a political insurrection, zombies or a meteor strike. It was just as scary as it could be, slow, methodical and unescapable.Then the actual movie starts.It turns out there is a wormhole in deep space and NASA decides to send three actually competent people and a lady who has seen too many rom coms that somehow ended up working at NASA and sent out in a mission that decides the fate of mankind.
Maybe with the right choice-making or should I say a better writing, that could be interesting. Since we would need the sentimental side of mankind to build a new society right? 
Well, this lady, a scientist, has the belief that love is the only power in the universe able to trascend time and space itself. A noble and poetic idea if you ask me, however, all the desitions the crew makes, revolve around not making this lady cry so then we can blame her and feel pity for her being wrong.Right after that, holy goodnes effin' gracious, the lady was right, love DOES trascend space and time, and mankind is saved because the main lead loves his daughter and is able to send her a mathematical equation from another dimension.
I will give you a second and I want you to read that out loud, and then read again all those reviews that say ""scientifically accurate""
Yeah, that's what I tought.Is a pretty looking movie with some interesting messages that ultimately falls flat on it's premise due to a poor writing choice. Almost looks like it was an excetutive desition. Shame."

I'm a man in my 40s now, was late 30s at the time I first saw it.
When I left the cinema the first time, I was in tears, I walked home and was still in tears about 30 mins later at home, blubbing to my wife, who couldn't understand what had happened to me because I couldn't even speak properly.
That's how strongly the movie affected me. I am in tears now, having watched it again.I love space movies, post apocalyptic movies, Christopher Nolan movies, so I was probably going to enjoy it but I can assure you I have never come out of the cinema with even a twitch in my eye after any other such movies.
Feeling tearful if googled ""interstellar makes"" and it filled in ""...me cry"" so I'm not the only one.
I see some people didn't enjoy it (1/10 seems a bit extreme but each to their own), I wonder if it meant more to me because I am a father of a girl? It would be good to hear from others who felt strongly either way but we can't discuss on IMDb anymore since the forums were taken down.
I recommend this movie to anyone and hope you enjoy it, remember to take a hanky."
" Good but a bit long
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,8,"This is a good sci-fi tale, if you can manage to sit for almost 3 hours, about a mission to save the planet from some disaster (either global warming, dust bowls, or whoever wins the next presidential election). Matthew McConaughey heads the mission, along with Anne Hathaway and a few others I hadn't seen before. They also have a neat robot named TARS. They fly off to find some previous scientists, who have entered a black hole and settled on several worlds possible for human habitation. Matt Damon plays one of the scientists.You have to like black holes, relativity, and the fifth dimension (not the pop group) to appreciate this. I didn't know a thing about this film beforehand, so it was a nice surprise to see Michael Caine pop up. And when William Devane showed up, I instinctively blurted out ""What's in your safe?""The special effects are fine, but the characters are more interesting, and you do want to see how the situations get resolved. McConaughey is good, but he mumbles on occasion, which drives me nuts. I liked the music score, but at times it drowned out the actors."

" Another tremendous cinematic experience by the best director of our time
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,9,"2015's INTERSTELLAR is one of Christopher Nolan's most ambitious works - and that is saying alot. It also is one of his best. Nolan - and his brother, the screenwriter of this film, Jonathan Nolan - wanted to make a ""real"" science fiction film, with the emphasis on the science, so they enlisted the help of noted theoretical physicist, Dr. Kip Thorne to ensure that they were not violating any established physical laws and that all speculations would spring from science and not fantasy.And, for the most part, they succeed.Following the adventures of ""everyman"" Cooper (if you call a farmer who is also a top notch astronaut, pilot and engineer an everyman), Interstellar tells of an Earth of the not-too-distant future that is running out of food and mankind must find a new planet to inhabit or else face extinction. Talked into leaving his family and heading into space, Cooper must face the challenges of his mission while fighting the emotions of leaving his family behind on a dying world.As Cooper, Matthew McConaughey (at the height of his ""McConnaissance"") is perfectly cast as this ""everyman"". He brings the right balance of charisma, heroism, emotional maturity, intelligence and a ""down to earth"" behavior that has us rooting for him from the start. His acting is at the highest level and is matched, beat by beat by Jessica Chastain and (surprisingly to me at the time) Anne Hathaway as a fellow astronaut/scientist.The special effects, worlds, circumstances, narrow escapes and deflating defeats are all handled in typical top-notch Nolan fashion, but it is the emotional stakes - specifically between McConaughey and Chastain (as his grown up daughter) are what keeps this film ""grounded"" and rises it above the standard sci-fi fair.Nolan regular Michael Caine, the always great John Lithgow, Wes Bentley, Ellen Burstyn, a ""before he was famous"" Timothee Chalamet, another ""before he was famous"" David Oyelowo, Casey Affleck and a ""surprise apperance"" by a very famous ""A"" lister (who I will not name, so as not to ruin it) are all equally as good and give the proceedings the gravitas it needs.Special notice needs to be made of the performance of Bill Irwin as the robot TARS (all space movies need a robot, right?). He performs the puppetry of the robot (Nolan wished to do everything as ""practical"" as possible) and adds large doses of humanity - and humor - to this non-human.Another bit of special notice needs to be given to frequent Nolan collaborator - the brilliant Composer Hans Zimmer. He was tasked by Nolan to create a ""unique"" score - one that does not rely heavily on crescendoing strings and horns - and he succeeds tremendously with a hauntingly, melodic and driving score that heightens - but never overpowers - the scenes playing on the screen.The decision as to whether or not you like this film will hinge on your ""believability"" of the final chapter - one where I ""went with the flow"" and was all right with, but (I'm sure) others will struggle with.All in all, another top notch film by the best director of our day. If you have never seen INTERSTELLAR - or if you haven't seen it in awhile - I suggest you check it out, you'll be glad you did.Letter Grade: A9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"

",2018-08-09 00:00:00,10,"After I saw this fantastic but very unsettling film, I made my mind up finally to do anything I could think of to improve our gorgeous planet. I planted trees. It was just about all I could afford to do. I have thus far planted four, three Oaks and an Elm. THANK you Jonathan Nolan. (BTW: Love Person of Interest, especially Carter!)"

" Good but nowhere near Great
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,6,"I see a lot of high scores for this movie and I am not exactly sure why that would be the case.
I would like to state that I rate Nolans work very highly but, as is the case with all movies, they should be judged on its own merit.
It is a good movie with an interesting and unique concept and is to be watched intensely to ensure you pick up on the subtle elements that have a bearing on the story. As to miss one element could result in a loss of understanding later on which could ruin the experience Nolan is trying to create.
I did find this film was unnecessarily long and drawn out and the dialogue flat and did not help with creating an atmosphere that was going to get me hooked, for these reasons the highest score i could give it is 6."
" Interstellar: Amazing even with its major flaws
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,8,"After a while, Christopher Nolan decided that he wanted to make a space film, maybe something as big as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Everyone was hoping that Interstellar was going to be the next 2001: A Space Odyssey, and I'm sorry to break it to you guys, but it's not. Interstellar is not a perfect film. It has a good amount of flaws, but it is still an amazing film. Let's start with the amazing performances. Matthew Mcconaughey has one of his best performances in this movie, and the emotion he expressed in this film actually made me cry at times. The actors that play the character Murph (the actors played younger and older versions of this character) had riveting performances and she also made me cry at the emotional moments. The cgi in this film gives me chills thinking about it because all the space and planet sequences looked so real and beautiful, it's probably one of the best cgi used in any film EVER! The story is about finding a new habitable planet, but the real theme of this movie is love. Matthew Mcconaughey's character had the choice of either finding a new planet and leaving his life behind, or staying with his family and letting the earth turning inhabitable. He chose to find a new habitable planet, and he and his daughter being apart, and him eventually regretting his actions has such a great emotional impact. The emotional impact in this film is probably the best aspect of this film, and this is one of the best emotionally driven Christopher Nolan films. But sadly, there is a handful of flaws. Matthew Mcconaughey was accompanied by other astronauts on this mission, and I did not really care about them or their backstories at all. Anne Hathaway plays one of the accompanying astronauts, and the movie concentrates more than they should on her, and I wasn't invested in her subplot because I cared way more for Matthew Mcconaughey and his daughter. Matt Damon also played an astronaut that was stranded on a planet with malicious intentions, and I even though his appearance is out of nowhere, I really did not care about him at all and I feel like he didn't even need to be in this film. The pacing of the first half is also very slow and at times did drag, but the second half really did escalate and became more of what this movie was supposed to be. I like the second half way better than the first half. Even with its glaring flaws, I still think this is a great film. 4/5P.S: The score is also outstanding, one of Han Zimmer's best"
" Epic Adventure

" Perfect Movie
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,10,"The film is very interesting and intriguing with a beautiful ending.
In addition, this film helps us understand how the general relativity proposed by Einstein works and how gravity has great influence on it.
On the end, I believe that it is inevitable that humanity will one day have to leave its planet and colonize another, it may take millions of years but maybe it will happen tomorrow, there is no way to know, and so the alternative proposed by the film of using the Cylinder of O'Neill for such a feat is a good alternative in my view."

I don't regret having watched it.
It's a good and pretty exciting movie, powerful in its sound effects and emotions. 
The big minus is in my opinion the end.
Finally, Cooper meets his daughter Murph again, but she's a very old lady now preparing for the death in the hospital. He only says hello to her and leaves right again and is searching his NASA buddy in the space! I hoped for an end in the bed room at farmers house, Murph should has been still a kid and Cooper still his age!"
" 2nd best favorite movie
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,8,"This movie covers hard to understand space theories. Like the 4th dimension, relativity and black holes. Topics you mainly see in documentaries and bad 
sci-fi movies. But this, this was a mind boggler. I mean the start was kind of slow but very much needed for the rest of the movie. The reason why they we're leaving Earth was kinda of off , but still. When the main character was in the 4th dimension, I mean. It was the most impressive way to explain the concept. Even I had difficulty grasping it. It proves Christopher Nolan did his homework has he normaly does. Do not under-estimate this Sc-Fi movie. It's not a wannabe Star Wars. It's a real adventure. A real 
Sc-Fi/Adventure/Suspence/Everything else movie. Take a piece of cake, some hot coco, go get a comfortable spot. And watch the whole movie in one take. You'll thank me later..."
" Clever, Stylish, Amazing
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,9,"Wow where do I start, what a film. I've wanted to watch this film for ages but for some reason I've only got round to seeing it recently and man am I annoyed I hadn't watched it sooner as I probably would have seen it several time over. I'm a massive Nolan fan but he has outdone himself with this particular movie. What with the new reinvention of Star Wars which has always dominated the sci-fi world this film completely outdoes it. Acting is superb, plot is clever with so many twists and turns for a film that's nearly 3 hours long it keeps you firmly on the edge of your seat. Loving the fan theories I've been reading linking Matt Damon's character with that of the one he plays in The Martian. Yeah they are only theories but like the movie are brilliant. If you have not seen this movie don't wait like I did. Buy it, download it, rent it. Do whatever you can to see it. It's brilliant"

" Interstellar: An Emotional Rollercoaster throughout Space
",2018-07-22 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar is one of the most well made, enjoyable and thoughtfull movie out there. Christopher Nolan surely outdid himself this time. This movie puts other space sci-fi movies like the Martian and Gravity to shame with its deep story and graphics. Let's start with the story. TL;DR, something's wrong with Earth. We never get told that but you instantly get the feeling that something's up throughout the whole movie. Coop, a retired pilot and his daughter Murph find a secret NASA base (or SNASA if you're nasty). Anyways Coop gets sent to space to find a new world for human kind and travels through a wormhole with a squad of scientists. You clearly see that a lot of time has got into this script of the movie and the science behind it. The whole movie is based around the Relativity theory and gravity. They talk about gravity a lot during the first segment of the movie, when they're on Earth, but then it becomes less important since they go into space for a majority of the second half of the movie. Gravity becomes a huge factor later on though especially at the very end where (SPOILERS) Coop gets stuck in a black hole and communicates with his daughter back in time using gravity. 
Also throughout the movie we get the feeling that time's important. Cooper and his co-worker dr Brand counts the seconds until they can get back to their respectivr family. Time becomes a huge factor when they travel to other planets and time moves differently than on Earth or in other places. 
I say that Interstellar has 3 major heartbreaks, or moments when you truly feel for the characters. 
The first one comes when Cooper leaves Earth and hus daughter gets real upset with him and smashes his watch. You truly feel because how on Earth are you going to leave the planet knowing your daughter is mad at you and that you might never see her again. 
The second one comes after dr Brand and Coop returns from the first planet only to realize that dr Romally who they left on the ship has aged 20 years while they've been down there for about an hour. 
Right after this comes heartbreak three when Cooper recieves messages from his son Tom and his daughter Murph and how crap their lives has turned into. Secondly we gotta talk about the music and sounds. This is done perfectly and they made the sounds accoring to the laws of nature and oly use music when needed to. The soundtrack couldn't be better.The cast is also perfect with Matthew McCaughney as lead actor. However I think the actors playing Murph did a better job since they all have the same personallity and actually kinda look alike (cootoes to the makeup artists). This movie isn't perfect and the only real issue I had was with the plotholes surrounding how Coop got back to Cooper station or how NASA got shut down and then continued to do extraordinairy research and develop gear that is move advanced than modern day. Sure we don'g know when this is but you get a feeling that it isn't that far from today. Overall, great movie. A MUST WATCH!"
" A good movie with some flaws.
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,7,"The movie was very exciting and had a good cast. People on Earth could only grow corn now due to a blight. There were a lot less people and most lived in rural areas growing corn. Even the New York Yankees had relocated to the country. Matthew McConaughey plays a farmer who once was a top pilot. He and his daughter somehow figure out where a secret NASA base is located. When they investigate they are captured and one of the people there is an old professor of his played by Michael Caine. Caine believes that the World will end in two generations due to a projected corn blight. McConaughey is recruited to take a crew through a wormhole to a neighboring galaxy where there are three planets that may support life. An early mission, led by an astronaut played by Matt Damon, disappeared on one of the planets. When the crew arrives on the planet where the astronaut is located, it turns out that the astronaut had been playing a con game. He pretended that there was urgency to come to the planet to save humankind, but in reality he cowardly just wanted to be rescued from the isolation of being the only person on the planet. There is also the duplicity of NASA in believing that they could let all of humanity die while letting a few colonizers continue life on a new planet. 
 The movie was very good with a great story, but had a few flaws. Firstly, when the crew arrives on the first planet there is nothing but still water a few feet deep. However, suddenly miles away a giant tidal wave about one thousand feet high appears. It only takes a few moments to get to within a few hundred yards of the space ship. The tsunami in Indonesia a few years ago was only about twenty feet high, but traveling at 535 miles per hour. It would seem logical that a thousand foot high tsunami would be traveling faster and with even more deadly force. Yet, suddenly the tsunami slows down and gives the astronauts tons of time to get back into the space ship. Still, one astronaut is killed when the female astronaut, played by Anne Hatthaway, insists on retrieving important data left by the previous exhibition to the planet. One of the four astronauts is killed. And, the force of the tsunami that big would probably destroy and crush even the strongest built space craft. 
 Another major flaw was that the movie assumed that all of the audience understood what was going on. Not everyone understands all the science involved and the movie needed to do a better job explaining how the science was plausible. The only possible explanation for the spaceship surviving the massive tsunami is the word ""gravity of 130%"". The significance of 130% was not very well explained. 
 Another problem had to do with the DVD I was watching. Some DVDs are not very good with sound. Oftentimes, characters were practically whispering, particularly Matthew McConaghey's character. There was some important dialogue going on, but I could not hear a lot of it. 
 Lastly, the last part of the movie was very complicated. While I did understand the concept of Love and the connections between events in the movie, particularly with his daughter and how she reacted to his abandoning the family for the mission, it seemed fantastic. The robot and the female astronaut eject from the space station, but the main character does not. Not really explained. Also, at some point, he ejects from his space craft. Not really explained. Also, I was wondering how a space craft could travel through this enormous worm hole at fantastic speeds and not hit one of the countless objects in the worm hole. It would take an exact projection of where all possible objects could be located to avoid the space ship from being destroyed. 
 Fantastically, the main character is rescued by the NASA station. The NASA Station was able to be refitted and went into space, becoming a two-dimensional circular micro World where some of humanity had survived (there was an eighty year time lapse due to the astronauts going deep into space and time becoming relatively faster). 
 Overall, a very good movie. Some things needed to be explained better. The movie got a bit confusing towards the end."
" One of the best Sci-Fi films ever made
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,10,"I don't think I've enjoyed a film at the cinema this much in some time. Before or since. An amazing cinematic experience. I loved every second of it. Up there with the best Science fiction films ever made. Arthur C Clarke would have loved this, I'm sure. Awe inspiring, thought provoking, original, topical, beautiful. Just incredible. Up their with the best of them - 2001, Blade Runner, Alien, Silent Running etc. The type of Sci-Fi we seldom get these days. It's not very 'Hollywood' and all the better for it. The Hanz Zimmer score is also amazing. Perfectly captures the awe & intensity of the movie. An amazing achievement all round. I'd go as far to say it's one of the best movies I've ever seen."
" Soothes me every time
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,10,This is so emotional and so soothing. Oh Nolan u genius!! And Hans zimmer you're exceptional.. listening to the music gives me chills everytime!! Especially the father daughter chemistry is so touching
" Greatest visual explanation of theory of relativity.
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,10,"Those giving this epic film less than 9 are nothing but trolls who don't have a life. Interstellar has stunning visuals which will give you virtual space trip. Apart from being sci-fi the movie emphasis on a father daughter relationship and decision people make to meet their loved ones no matter what . If you are a sci-fi, thriller and emotional movie lover, interstellar is a perfect blend."
" simply amazing
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,9,"You love visual effects they got it , you love getting to know more about space they got it . you should know tho the movie can be very complicated at some point"
" Visual and scientific experience
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,9,"Fascinating story with beautiful scenes and music that really draws me in. I start with why it still does not get 10 points. The early sequence when Cooper hacks into the drone and controls it seems a bit awkward to me if it was meant to characterize him. And although it is a clever idea to watch Cooper observe the past (and not simply time travelling) I was a bit disappointed because the story is not consequent in the aspect of manipulating the past. On the other hand, I was intrigued by the aspect of ageing as a consequence of gravitation and acceleration and how this is incorporated in the script. What I further like about this movie is the visualization of higher dimensions. And the fact that the are no aliens, only human beings. The size and desolation of the universe that we see emphasizes the message that humanity itself is responsible for our planet."
" Best muvie ever

" Amazing story,music, and cinematic
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,10,I love this movie.........................................
" A truly incredible sight for the eye to behold. Well done, Nolan.
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is a space epic that is a story about the strength of love. Christopher Nolan is famous for his cerebral stories and practical effect usage over CGI. Nolan is an expert when it comes to 3 things:1.) Playing with our emotions.2.) Casting his characters.3.) Production values.I also might add that I didn't mind the runtime at all. Hans Zimmer did an amazing score, and it will be ever so iconic in the future. And lastly, I cried my eyes out. Well done, Nolan."
" Masterful, intellectual space thriller
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,10,"When one thinks of a space movie, they usually do not envision anything profound or emotional, but rather action paired with over-the-top special effects and unrealistic creatures. Interstellar breaks this mold, presenting an intellectual storyline that revolves around a simple theme: mankind will do whatever it takes to ensure their survival.The first difference about this movie is that it is not simply watched for a cheap thrill. This is a deeply intellectual film that deals with complex ideas in a much more realistic way than other films tend to do. The events that take place in the movie seem plausible. This starts with the creation of a simple, believable dystopian world where water becomes scarce and food cannot be grown. As the film continues on and more and more scientific ideas are presented, there always seems to be a logical explanation for what is occurring, meaning that the audience is rarely left asking why something was the way it was.In addition to the excellent intellectual writing, this film also wows in its production. The visual effects created are truly breathtaking, bringing the seemingly indescribable mysteries of space, and even a different dimension, to life. Furthermore, the sounds that are chosen to represent space are perfect. The movie alternates between high-pitched, eerie notes or, to an even greater effect, no noise at all, capturing the idea of the vast emptiness of space.Though it certainly is thrilling to watch, it is all of these little details below the surface that make ""Interstellar"" one of the greatest space films to date. It lacks the plot holes that belittle other space movies while passing on a far more profound message. It is absolutely worth a watch...and a second, and a third."
" Hands down most amazing film I have ever seen at the cinema
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,10,"I was blown away by this film, the sound, the music, the experience!! It was amazing but I couldn't recreate it at home, I feel sorry for anyone who didn't see this at the cinema, it was just amazing and spun me right out in such a good way!"
" Beautiful pictures, moronic story.
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,3,"This is some kind of liberal's rescue story for saving mankind from themselves as a result of their environmental sins. As is all too common these days, the script-writing was left to terminally-lazy intellects who could simply not make the effort to write even a vaguely credible physical background to a poorly contrived plot. So we are left with what will become one of the most infamously badly construed sciency ""love stories"" (which is only the director's opinion - and he failed at getting that right as well). This movie was a massive disappointment."
" Simply moving.
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,10,"Ive actually seen this movie for the second time in 2 years, after of course the time and mind bending physics and theoretical analogy of this movie or shall I saw Sci-fi, realizing that we are not so far away from the application of most ""science fictions"", I have to say that this movie draws a line not between but towards a new way of thinking into a broad physical applicable theoretical playground provided by Dr. Kip Thorne; this is actually a perfect time border to re-view the movie; knowing that the ending has to do with Cooper reconnecting to his daughter through bending of time and space drawn from the concept of blackholes, but the ideology leading to this immersion between mind and physics or lets say chemistry, is just sublime! The relation has been referred to in other movies and DMT theories but the way this movie drags this theoretical realm into a cinematic dramatic realm is simply what moves you. Not to mention the acting, the production, the actual scientific reference, and surely cohesion used in this is far from remarkable. I dont say this much but id watch this movie again and again."
" Awesome!
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,7,"I walked into the theadere with no expectations. I had seen no trailers and did not know what the movie was about...and I realy liked it. It stats abit slow,but then Philip Glass like music starts and create a unforgettable atmosphere. The biggest surprise for me was when Matt Deamon turns up, which I liked and acts kind of illogical, but it works. The movie makes you start to question things."
" Fans of Space Should Watch This
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,10,"I have seen this film about 4 times, I'm also thinking of buying a special edition of this film because not only an actors masters class, mind melt, theory provoking and an amazing cast. It's a film you need to watch again and again. That's why I gave it 10/10."
" The end of Earth will not be the end of us.
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,9,"The world is coming to an end. NASA is working on finding an alternative planet for human existence. To execute this mission, three astronauts led by ex-NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) are travelling to the other side of the galaxy to examine possible planets suitable for establishing a human colony. As story suggests, ""Interstellar"" is a sci-fi film along with adventure and drama. Christopher Nolan wrote the screenplay with his brother Jonathan Nolan, produced it with his wife Emma Thomas and directed it himself. It has a runtime of 169 minutes and premiered on October 26, 2014.""Interstellar"" focuses more on human feelings and emotions than the logical part of space travel. Since the very beginning of the film, we see a special bond between a father and a daughter. This special bond will save the humanity. All the other elements, all the logic behind the space travel, black holes, gravity, relativity, time and dimensions are to create a good background story for humanity in pursue of a new home and new hopes. In my opinion this is the main idea of ""Interstellar."" Of course, in a good film you expect each element to be perfect and detailed. Theoretical Physicist Kip Thorne is both scientific consultant and executive producer and thanks to his contributions to the production, physics and essentials of space travel are explained to the audience in the simplest way possible through the passionate conversations during the whole film. To understand ""Interstellar,"" you need to have a general idea about physics. Things you learn in the film about space and physics are just fascinating. All this scientific and logical explanations about our earth and space travel that are combined with human emotions and feelings make ""Interstellar"" a very interesting film. There is a perfect balance of logic and feelings in the film just like the perfect balance in our galaxy.Giving up on their lives, families, friends and comfort zones, those four astronauts are devoting themselves fully to human race and their salvation. No physical rule in the world can explain the enormity of this sacrifice. Therefore, ""Interstellar"" is a story based on human emotions. The great balance between emotions and logic is the strongest point of the film. This idea is supported by passionate conversations, gestures and mimics and scientific displays.While watching ""Interstellar,"" I got deep into thoughts about our existence and the earth we are living in. How the perfect balance of physics makes life a possibility. How gravity and relativity work and how they are related to us. Thinking about possible life forms on other planets. All those thoughts together with the story gave me chills almost the whole time. Of course, visual and sound effects have a lot to do with the transmission of those thoughts. Visual effects in the black hole and throughout the film were amazing and the film won the Academy Award for Best Achievement in Visual Effects. The sound and the music are also powerful. Using music and sounds in the right moments have a manipulative effect in the film. For example, you get excited in the scenes that are not exciting because of the usage of right sounds. Take off scene is just one of them. This combination of visual effects with right sounds earned the film Academy Award nominations for Best Original Score, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing. ""Interstellar"" has one additional nomination for best product design.I liked all the main characters from Anne Hathaway to Michael Caine, from Jessica Castain to Matt Damon but I need to open a special parenthesis to Matthew McConaughey. His character Cooper is a hero, all the humanity is depending on him that's why his mental strength must be felt by the audience to believe in him. With his Texas accent and physical features McConaughey shows an outstanding performance in the film. In every scene you see his passion and not mentioning several close-up weeping scenes. With the camera shots (33mm in anamorphic format) Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema fits well in the brilliant picture of the film. In some parts camera itself is telling the story even though this is something you don't get to see a lot in Nolan films. He mostly uses the camera to illustrate the story. Soundtracks are made by my personal favorite composer Hans Zimmer. When the sounds are not used, you get to enjoy beautiful soundtracks.Each component of ""Interstellar"" is detailed and beautiful, aiming to give audience something. From all the points of view, ""Interstellar"" deserves all the credits to qualify as a masterpiece. It is one of the best example of epic sci-fi genre as well. Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light."
" A masterpiece!
",2018-06-29 00:00:00,10,A masterpiece that worth every moment of watching!
" Original and thrilling, but a bit overlong
",2018-06-29 00:00:00,8,"With 169 minutes runtime, this is the longest Christopher Nolan feature and one of the longest movies I've ever seen. In the beginning, the whole idea of some ""end of the world"" could be seen as a cliche, but taking into regard that Nolan always offers us something that's original, or narrated in a unique way, it probably has a good explanation and an unexpected turn of events. Which it does. As someone who's watched many films about space, it was rather fun and interesting to see taking it to a new level. There's an emotional aspect of father having to leave his family in order to save humanity, which may be distressing and disturbing to many. I am not saying the movie is bad. In fact, probably one of the best movies with this thematic. It is just that at some points it felt overlong and unnecessary (maybe there are people who saw this as an almost 70 year long movie, so I can't blame them either), especially the dialogues. However, the duration sometimes is justified by spectacular shots and well-executed CGI, which is rather fascinating in itself, despite the plot. There are also some scientifical parts which are sometimes hard to follow, and I read more about some things I wasn't quite sure about, sometimes finding them described and explained completely differently than what's shown in the movie. However, one cannot blame the director for that, since many in the audience probably don't understand the subject completely. It was explained reasonably. The ending confused me a bit, which is also why I was slightly dissatisfied after finishing this movie. But generally, I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.DISCLAIMER : Everything stated in this review is entirely matter of personal opinion and doesn't have to coincide with the opinions of other reviewers"
" One of the best sci-fi movies ever!!!
",2018-06-29 00:00:00,10,Perfect sci-if film. The kind of one where you don't know if you dreaming or not. I went into the theater not expecting much and was blown away. It is now one of my top 3 movies. If there is another sci-ifovie as good as this in the next 20 years I would be surprised. It is especially good because of the fact that most of the physics checks out. Even as far as the theoretical stuff goes
" Interstellar: a true space odyssey.
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,9,"How could I describe such a beautiful picture, such outstanding performances and top notch directing? Christopher Nolan's interstellar is the year's true gem, and above the most authentic scientific experience that Hollywood has ever witnessed throughout al its long history of space films, an astonishing accuracy that was guaranteed by the now Nobel prize winner Tip Thorn. It is a true Oscar worthy masterpiece. Interstellar is a perfect mix between brilliant cinematography, staggering visual effects, and a surprisingly accurate depiction of the world of astrology, and is inarguably the best picture by visionary director Christopher Nolan (I still concur to that statement in the year 2018, after 'Dunkirk ' his latest epic film, has been brought to the big screen). But let's not speak profusely about the brilliance of Christopher Nolan, for it is a universal consensus. Instead let's dwell on the real charm of this movie, the one that transcends its scientific accuracy, which is its incredible ensemble cast and their respective performances, starting by Mathew Mconaughey who made an Oscar worthy piece of acting, portraying Joseph Cooper, a widowed spacecraft pilot who struggles between his responsibilities as a father and those of the leader of earth's last hope to escape an impeding extinction, a character with so much emotion to show but in such unforgiving conditions and that only an experienced and talented actor can understand and depict. In such a dark apocalyptic atmosphere, though shot dynamically and rather beautifully by Christopher Nolan's camera, shines a persona that soaks all the heavy scientific and gripping scent of the movie into a gentle mix of hope and affection: in a time of hopelessness and fear, Amelia Brand, portrayed by the beautifully talented Anne Hathaway, disavows science in a time where can only lead to her doom and acknowledges entities that not even science can understand, human sentiments that transcend space and time. This stance, though seen by some as criminally obscene and illogical, is of the essence of this picture's philosophy, one that is meticulously explained and pictured by the beautiful imagery and clever dialogue that interstellar has more than enough to show. Another exceptional feature of this picture its perfectly timed usage of wide shots, using this to create peaceful pauses throughout the intense course of the film to silently stare to the inspiring abyss of the deep dark space, giving the viewer a sense of immersion and serenity that only a few movies succeeded in achieving.
One might call interstellar a technical masterpiece, a visual chef d'oeuvre or a scientific reference, yet its most important aspect is far more deeper in my opinion, one that supersedes the story or the future it represents: the depiction of humanity as a lonely entity in this universe and exploring our connection with it, discovering that the outcome of us being the only species even when settling in the fourth dimension is quite possible is for me very unsettling, what's most praise worthy in this marvellous picture is the question it leaves the audience with, as it is for all the pictures that Christopher Nolan has blessed us with."

" Vsiting the Einstein's
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,10,"For the first time ever, experience the Einstein's General theory of relativity in action on the big screen.
The Sci-fi Nolan film, Interstellar, touches the heart of its audience with the scientifically accurate special effects, curated by Kip Thorne an Astrophysicists and scientific advisor of the film.
The beautifully shot film on IMAX never lets the audience miss the 3D effect.
It successfully grips the audience on their seats, till the very end.The film not only succeeds in finding its enormous breath but also touches the depth.
The plot revolves around in an exciting manner with Black holes, Wormholes, 5th Dimensions and what not paying its visits from time to time. The special effect is exciting but it is the soundtrack that take you out of the solar system.
Hans zimmer's celestial soundtrack makes the movies reverberate in your mind even after the end of it.The beauty of the character is revealed in their inner conflict between choosing the family or the duty.
We see various characters in the conflict between the human heart.
In the end, Nolan in his own poetic way does imply that duty is family or family is duty.Characters are very engaging and their progression throughout the story seems superfluous and consistent.
Characters are indeed made up from their dialogue and action.
In Interstellar dialogue flows like a poem but McConaughey accent is sometimes difficult to comprehend.The characters do explain the science behind the scenes from time to time but someone new to the genre, the astounding breath and complexity might even be a bit confusing.
In a single watch, the plot might seem a bit shaky and difficult to extrapolate at times.
Some might say that the success of the movies lies in its wide exploration and also its failure, but weaving together the disconnected Einstein's genius theory and its prediction in one movies shows the utter-brilliance of Nolan.In the end, Nolan as always has brought something new and fresh in the market which is definitely worthy of your time."
" I would rate 11/10
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,10,"I hadn't seen this but movie and caught it on a flight back from the DR. 
One of my favorite movies of all time. I would give the first half of the movie an 11/10, just completely enjoyed it as a sci fi/ thriller(in the sense of so much always being on the line). I loved the acting and just yeah, a great movie and one you should go see if you never have"
" Did I miss something?

" A Simple review
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar was an amazing experience. The story was sub-par at best, it was nothing great. A father leaves his home for the greater good, his daughter hates him for it- until she doesn't. The father faces many dangers and conflicts both internal and external on his journey, and his daughter still hates him- but is good at math. The father gets lost to time and ends up younger than his daughter(he did not get younger, she got older) and the daughter loathes him for not returning. As one can see the plot of the film carries no weight, no feeling, no magic. The magic, rather, resides in the scientific aspect of the movie. Most things that happen in the movie regarding gravity or space in general are all mathematical possibilities. Though there are false facts in the movie (for example: ice-clouds) there are many ideas shown in the movie that science claims true. The possibility of wormholes existing in space, the flow of time being altered by gravity, or even the claim that gravity is a force that can travel between dimensions so that an existence in the fifth dimension can communicate with one in the third dimension in all scientifically possible. We have the math to prove it. That is where this movie shines its brightest, it presents and explains (somewhat) these possible theories to people who may have never heard of them. This is what makes Interstellar such an amazing experience."
" A Film That Pushes The Boundaries of What A Movie Can Be
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,10,"I had walked into this movie having heard and seen the reviews by both critics and users that called the film 'over-rated' and 'just another Nolan flick.' I was pleasently pleased that this was not the case. The soundtrack, the acting, the script and my gosh the effects! This movie pushes what film itself is capable of. If you are person infatuated with movies just like me, watch this film."

" The best movie I ever watched
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,10,"This is clearly the best movie and I will regret not watched in theatre the rest of my life. The atmosphere created by Nolan is so amazing that no one ever has been close to this. I think that we will stay a time without see a movie like this because most of creator in nowadays do not want try something big and risky. I watched the trailer and expected a action movie with interstellar travel, but this movie is much more than this, Nolan and Hans Zimmer together could shake your hearth, is so powerful. I already watched seven times this movie and I will watch more. If you did not watch yet, make the magic happen and you will see what I am talking about."

" Probably the easiest 10 I've ever voted for a film . . .
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,10,"Probably the easiest 10 I've ever voted for a film, and that's saying a lot since I very rarely score any film of any genre with a 10 or even a 9.This production is so radically different, even if you don't happen to be a sci-fi fan or one who ponders the greater questions of existence on this world and in the universe, this production will open up this realm of thought via a journey that is spectacular.The closest conceivable comparison that might be possible would be Stanley Kubrick's 2001:A Space Odyssey, but that's only a very rough analogy at best.Every aspect of this production was crafted about as perfectly as could be given the context of the story, and what it's trying to convey. Are there technical or scientific flaws as such as portrayed? Yes, of course, much of this is wrapped around theoretical concepts which are still very much a work in progress.But that such a complex and compelling concept could be woven into a story with such heart, mapped into the very essence of what it is to be human . . . this is a film very much worth the time spent to watch it.My suggestion would be that you may likely watch it several times, as various layers and dimensions become evermore present in ways that may not have been initially apparent the first time going in.A special thumbs up to Anne Hathaway, this may have been her best role ever (in my admittedly biased opinion), but everyone in this film shines.The direction, cinema photography, production quality . . . absolutely top notch, don't think this could have been done much better.As I said earlier, even if this is not your typical cup of tea, take a sip with this one. I seriously doubt you'll be disappointed.My score 10+"
" Theory of everything
",2018-06-04 00:00:00,9,"How hard it is, probably, not to break under the exorbitant weight of threatening ambitions, especially when it comes to ""the most anticipated film of the year"" - that's how and in no other way did they call the last work of Christopher Nolan in a cinema environment. The benefits of this hysteria are few. Do not wait for ""everything, and immediately, and more"", because the blockbuster - the last word that comes to mind when trying to somehow characterize the ""Interstellar"", because the intellect here clearly outweighs even such a smart exterior design. As it went, it did not sound, but we have a truly multifaceted and complex film that can be adequately perceived in several different planes, and the maximum effect will be achieved only if you are able to look deeper.In the not too distant future, humanity is at a stage of regression: high technologies no longer worry us as much as the primary need for food. The farmer's profession becomes one of the most respected, and the craft is not easy, because for certain reasons nature is no longer our friend - one by one the whole vegetable crops are destroyed, refusing to yield crops. Against this background, the former pilot, and now the farmer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is invited to join an expedition designed to test potentially life-worthy planets in another Galaxy, the passage into which, in the form of a so-called ""wormhole"", was recently discovered in our Solar System . While the expedition is busy searching, Dr. Brand (Michael Caine) here on Earth will have to complete his research and development, as a result of which he plans to find an effective way to transport the world's population to a new home. But if suddenly he does not find it - on board the interstellar ship there is a sufficient stock of the terrestrial gene pool to start the population ""from scratch"" - this is not an iridescent version of the development of events called ""plan B"". As a form in his latest work, Nolan uses a so-so, relatively speaking, ""fantastic"" plot, in which, however, modern scientific research is much more than some fantasies of the creators. Without the second, however, it was not done either - but more on that later. At the same stage, it should be said that the script is really very tightly based on modern physics and currently existing theories, and uses a lot of scientific terms - so if you do not know, for example, what the ""event horizon"" is, and why the measure approaching the black hole, time slows down - it makes sense to prepare yourself a little before watching the movie, so you can understand what the heroes are talking about.For all this physics and mathematics, of course, there are real human fates, feelings and experiences. The film is still at the beginning, before the departure of Cooper devotes a long time demonstrating family interactions - but there, in the ""ordinary"" terrestrial environment, this looks quite ordinary. However, as the story develops, the emotions and factors that generate them gradually take on a completely different form - here Nolan already tangles this tangle consisting of imperfection of our psyche, instincts and feelings towards others much more densely. In the emotional aspect, the film turns out to be very strong - without any conventionality or falseness. It is here that one of the most memorable scenes that produces such an effect is due to the breadth of the talent of the magnificent McConaughey. After it there is no doubt that the viewer will stay with the hero until the end, at whatever cost. Nolan allegedly opposes the cold soulless cosmos to the warmth of real human feelings, emphasizing their significance. In this regard, I would like to note that the culmination and its justification will probably not be understood by all, since here the plot departs from the science trail, it goes, in the literal sense, to the unknown - without spoilers it is difficult to say more, therefore, I just recommend not to take this allusion literally, and focus on what it means. It is also important to read between the lines and see things in perspective - and then you can see where as more logic than it might seem at first glance. But there will also be an ambiguous finale, leaving behind mixed feelings, and infusing a new subtext to where it would seem that everything has already been laid out on the shelves.
""Interstellar"" amazes with its multitasking and coverage of the topics being raised. To some extent, this is also a minus, because the ideas embedded in the script, would be more than enough for three or four films. From this, it is not always perceived exactly, and at some moments even requires some effort and concentration when viewing. But in a decent way to accumulate so much food for thought in one movie, even three hours, by force of units. Not to mention how effective the picture works on the upper outer level, combining visual and sound images. Visually, the film is completely different from modern digital blockbusters: shot on a film and with real scenery, it generates an absolutely unique atmosphere. The same goes for the sound series - Zimmer clearly caught the mood: the sound is old-fashioned, unorganized and bright. This surprisingly deep, beautiful author's cinema is the long-awaited odyssey of Nolan, which remains in memory for a very, very long time."
" Almost perfection and completely underrated!
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,9,"Going back to a film roughly four years after its release is actually a really interesting way of viewing how your opinion on a film can change or stay the same. Back 2014 I remember that this was one of the the most anticipated films of the year, Christopher Nolan directing a science fiction film. My main take away from the film was the grand perspective and direction that the film had, the sense of really pushing the boundaries in terms of what can be portrayed on film. Overall I absolutely fell in love with the film four years ago and now 2018 I pretty much have the same feelings towards the film. Almost perfection and completely underrated however it does have a few problems. Chris Nolan's directing is impeccable throughout the film with so many styles of camera format and frame put into one film it is hard to keep up, you will either hate this or love it and I tend to love it. Even in 2018 I still think its some of his best directing in all of his films. Insanely good!You know that the creators of a film are taking it seriously when they are getting creative help from an actual physicist in Kip Thorne. The story of the film is one of the most complex stories in film, I no Im probably wrong in that statement, so many layers and separate stories being weaved in and out perfectly. Combining all these story threads and building the film around a foundation of real science, to a certain degree, is a true achievement. The film is giving a science lesson with out you realising it. I encourage anyone who loves this film to watch the making of this film and especially the stuff about Kip Thorne's involvement in the project, extremely fascinating. The cast of the film could not be anymore brilliant everyone from McConaughey to Caine they are all superb in there various roles. Standouts for me are probably McConaughey, Chastain and Hathaway. All of them bring there a game and bring theses characters to life, beautiful crafted by all of them.However there are two cast members that 100% deserve a mention, not only do the actors but Chris Nolan and production team to. Not since, ""HAL"" in ""2001 : A Space Odyssey"" or C3P0 and R2-D2 in ""Star Wars"", have two robotic characters been some memorable and fantastically used. Bill Irwin and Josh Stewart have done fantastic voice work and I think Irwin actually operated both of them manually for majority of the time, apart from the CG scenes. They bring two seemingly boring and not pretty looking blocks to life in that way is incredible, a truly fantastic achievement. The dialogue written for them, especially TARS, is fantastic and some of the highlights of the film.The last positives are the cinematography,production design and score. The cinematography and production design are faultless throughout and are mesmerising. The screen in beautiful and jaw dropping to look at with some really creatively design spacecraft. However one of the biggest highlights of the film is the score and for me personally the best score every created. I said it back in 2014 and I'll say it now, for me personally it is the best score ever, pure genius and magic from Hans Zimmer. That docking scene........the score is amazing and at the end with ""Brand"" tear jerking.Lastly there are a couple of negatives, firstly the film is way to long, about 20 minutes to long, I've always wondered if the film should have ended when ""Copper"" enters the black hole, could have been a cliffhanger. Im not to sure on this meet older ""Murph"" stuff at the end, its just not needed I don't think, I know the film is trying to give an emotional punch but it really doesn't work for me. More importantly though what happened to ""Tom"", like what happened to him we have no idea and actually the whole film/story completely shafts his character, was there much point having the character in the film?Overall 95% out of 100% or 9.5 out of 10 simply brilliant and almost perfect just a few little problems here and there. Completely underrated not only for Christopher Nolan but for Sci-fi films. Not for everyone, you either love it or hate it and I love it!"
" best sci fi movie
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,9,I WOULD NEVER GET TIRED OF WATCHING THIS MOVIE. UNTIL NOW IT STILL MAKES ME CRY AND IT STILL BREAKS MY HEART!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
" Nolan's Space Drama is Kind Of A Mixed Bag
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,7,"If I reviewed this film back in 2014, I would have probably given it a 9/10. However, now I've started to question some of the things about the film that just didn't really work for me.Christopher Nolan is considered one of the best directors working today, and I can attest to that. He reinvented Batman for the modern audience with ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"" (after those crappy Joel Schumacher movies), and is even more famous for the thrillers ""Memento"" and ""Inception"". Nolan is a director known for making most of his movies think-pieces. With the exception of ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"", his movies aren't straightforward, especially not ""Memento"". In fact, they are quite complex. ""Interstellar"" tries to be, but sometimes, it just feels silly.PROS:
As usual, Christopher Nolan knows how to make a well made movie. While most directors tend to use computer generated visuals whenever they get the chance, Nolan tries to go for using practical effects as often as he can. And even when he does use CG, it doesn't look distractingly fake.The cast in this film was great. Matthew McConaughey, Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, and even child actor Mackenzie Foy were all great in their roles. There were some good performances from other actors (Timothee Chalamet, John Lithgow, Casey Affleck), but their roles were quite insignificant.-A large majority of the movie (specifically the first 2 hours 15 minutes) were absolutely great. It really worked as a dramatic sci-fi epic. I feel that if the movie was half an hour shorter, I would have given this movie a 9 (or maybe even a 10) out of 10.
Parts of the last half an hour (specifically the more heavily scientific elements) were done well. The first three times I watched ""Interstellar"", this part completely lost me. However, after watching a brief explanation by Neil DeGrasse Tyson (I was THAT desperate to understand this movie), it made a lot of sense.A large part of this movie is McConaughey's relationship with his characters daughter, played by Mackenzie Foy (as a child), Jessica Chastain (as an adult), and Ellen Burstyn (in her final minutes before she dies). The performances of McCounaghey and Foy really made their relationship feel real, and this even brought some scenes of emotion. I'm specifically referring to two scenes.The first is when McConaughey tells Foy that he has to leave, but also that he doesn't know when he's coming back. He even states that she may be as old as he is at this moment by the time he comes back (that's kind of a harsh thing to say to your daughter). Their acting really evoked a lot of emotion as it was evident that he didn't want to leave, but did so to be able to save her.
The second is a scene where he is watching video messages in his ship that were sent from his family. After an incident on a planet with harshly different relativity than Earth, McConaughey discovers that 27 years had passed on Earth. He watches messages on the ship and essentially watches his children grow up on a TV screen. The whole scene, McConaughey is weeping as he discovers these important events and regrets that he wasn't there to witness them.
I absolutely loved Hans Zimmer's score. It was absolutely spectacular. Some have joked that this film's score sounded like Hans Zimmer fell asleep on his organ, but I still felt that it was a mesmerizing soundtrack to a very interesting science fiction film.CONS (spoilers):
The film's last moments didn't work for me. They felt really cheesy. The main plot of the film involves trying to find habitable planets to move humans to. Hathaway wants to go to a certain planet, but partly because her boyfriend is researching it. In this scene, she says that love is the only thing that can go throughout space. To be honest, this felt like a slightly touching scene.Then I realized that this seemingly insignificant line was actually a big plot point. I won't go too deep into this, but I didn't really appreciate that.
Finally, I felt that the film dragged on in the final moments. Granted, one could say the same about ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" (which I gave a 10 out of 10), but all of those moments actually felt necessary; also that was an adaptation of a book, while ""Interstellar"" was an original idea.Overall, I do recommend this film. But this is NOT Christopher Nolan's magnum opus that I originally viewed this film as."
" A potentially great film but.....
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,4,"...ruined by almost indecipherable speech, especially on the part of Cooper. We chose this film as it had received good reviews and we like a good science fiction film, but within the first ten minutes we knew we were in for a 'what did he say' -fest. The actor playing Cooper had such mumbled, lazy diction and spoke in a semi whisper it was almost impossible to understand anything he said. About an hour in we almost decided to give up and watch an old 60's Doris Day & Rock Hudson comedy instead - at least you can hear every word clear as a bell. But we struggled through all 2.5 hours of it and came out the other end none the wiser.
Do they go somewhere to learn how to mangle their speech? Or maybe they have their jaws wired?"

" Well then
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,9,"I love this film. The story is fantastic and touching, the suspense is brilliant, the visuals and sound are amazing, the characters are incredible and it's just generally mind blowing and amazing. The only complaint I have to mention is that it takes science in its hands and completely throws it out the window., but the bits that are scientifically plausible are as a result absolutely insane. Very much worth the watch."
" Good, but not great
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,"Well, it did go on too long, but I enjoyed the relationships of the fathers and daughters displayed and the black hole he was experiencing that showed various time lines of his past in a sort of rubix cube overhead shot. It dragged on the one ice planet that makes them age by 7 years every hour. I also didn't think it had an ending. It kind of stopped."
" It to Sifi- Movies to another level.
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,9,"With Interstellar Christopher Nolan has taken a huge undertaking. A science fiction epic of this scale (accusation with Kubrick's 2001 A space Odyssey are apt) which relies less on CGI effects and set pieces and more on human connection and cerebral science has never been released since, well, 2001. And the film delivers for the most part though some may question the exposition and deux ex Machina aspects of it. Overall a fine entry in Nolan's filmography and a great addiction to the thinking man's science fiction list."
" A real inspiration

",2018-05-14 00:00:00,10,"Nolan really expressed all the points and all the minds I ever thought.This movie inculding multiple material .Macro philosophy causing you to consider plenty of issues.
Such as the mystery puzzle of the entire period since the first cell appeared.That is --LOVE.A father and children attachment each other .A female wanted to meet her lover even though she know he probably die.You just can explain in sicience it call hormone.Those emotions perfectly display in the movie.
 The scene of Mann with cooper communication is really touch me.Human survival instinct is singel greatest source of inspiration.When a situation you dying,survival instinct will press a incredible strength to create miracle.
 Humanity selfish.Dr.Brand never expecting to save Earth peoples.Dr Mann don't wanna death lonely in the desolate plant.
 Physics theory.Relativity time dilation.Wormhole,blackhole,gravitational affect,five dimension description.
 And the soundtrack from Hans Zimmer.Dramatic,grandeur,inspiring and majestic.
So many scene make you tear up involuntray.
At last underlying of the film is love that transcends space,time.Eventually save us."
" An space-epic sweeping in scale yet intimate in scope.
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,10,"'Interstellar (2014)' is a space-epic that feels remarkably intimate and emotionally resonant while also being sweeping in scope and visually stunning. The mixture of earthy textures and sleek sci-fi aesthetics makes for an interesting visual juxtaposition between the two sets of characters. While its third act does get a little existential and abstract, the narrative reasoning behind it and scientific integrity leading up to it allows for constant believability. This film never fails to have an impact on me, it is truly breathtaking work. In fact, it is one of my favourite pictures of all time. 10/10"
" Waste of time, though not exempt of production values.
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,4,"Production OK. Cast acting OK, given what they were given. Music is also good. Script and plot development suck to high heavens and in all dimensions: a collection of science BS, psyco-Babel and cheap, inconsistent emotional one shots.

" Mind Blowing and Emotional!
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,10,"In my opinion, one of the greatest films of all time. movies often struggle to tell a whole story in a restricted amount of time, but Christopher Nolan has nailed it (as usual) starts off pretty slow, but builds beautifully into a mind blowing visual and theoretical piece!

These became well-known due to the work of scientists like Stephen Hawking. Though it is difficult for most viewers to understand the mechanics of a multi-dimensional timespace, in this movie the elaboration on the topic and its presentation are meticulously approached, for making it quite apprehensible.The earth is at the point where the depletion of natural resources is imminent and there is need for migration to exoplanets for the survival of the human species. This state of the earth creates a feeling of melancholia and fear about the foreseeable future that is conveyed properly to the audience. This dystopia is a key factor for the movie's success.Instead of the scientific scope, the relation of the main character (former scientist and current farmer) to his daughter (future scientist) is developed with intimate approach and it is described by deep human feelings. This connection creates a perfect balance to the scientific side of the movie, making it attractive to a wider audience and contributing that way to its final success.There are some moments that may initially seem not to be based on reality (more likely being paranormal) like the attempt from the father to communicate with his daughter behind the bookshelf. The good point is that scenes such as this, are explained in a scientifically consistent manner at the end. 10/10.

" Great, entertaining, amazing
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,10,"This is a sort of movies that leave some mark when watching it once. The story makes one thinks about the nature, physics, the universe, and life. ""How many thoughts a movie can give"" is a great criterion that I use to decide how much I enjoyed any movie, and Interstellar gave me a lot of new thoughts. After finishing watching this movie I kept imagining those various, interesting situations given in it. The parts dealing with physics in this movie are very well written and directed, and the net result of what it looked like is awesome, just awesome. The story: Perfect, keeps attracting through the movie, until the part is reached when it confuses concepts of time travel at the very end of the movie (I'm not going to spoil it). This is why I didn't rate it a full 10 stars. Everything else is awesome, acting, filmography and directing, visual effects, and (specially) the music! I'd recommend it for physicists-and artists as well."
" Overlong and ONLY amazing in parts, DISAPPOINTED!
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,3,"Let me say at the start: Incredible Imagination! But if you are looking for a 'space' movie, don't even bother. I watched this movie for, well, some visual graphics! And boy there stunning! Liked the imagination of life on another planet and also how it was portrayed. I signed for a special space journey. How did I get? It was 40 minutes into the movie that saw some action. Lot of heavy accented and emotional drivel were served before and prior that. Ok, so 20 minutes of 'real' action out of first 95 minutes. Still hopeful (Its a long long movie),'then again 10 minutes of graphics and action. Then incredible imagination! Loved that but wasn't watching this movie fir imagination. And then it ended. 3 hours passed by, out of which only 30 minutes of space-time (No pun intended). 
 
So, it boils down to what you signed for. Emotional drama or space expedition. If the later is your choice then you shall be terribly, terribly disappointed for 124 years. By the way, the robot was really sarcastic and fantastic!"
" The soundtrack alone is incredible
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,10,"The movie soundtrack is so beautiful that I sometimes only watch this movie just to listen to it. I have the entire soundtrack on my phone which I listen to several times a week because its such an incredible piece and has a calming effect. 
The movie itself is quite good with well chosen actors. I personally think Mackenzie Foy is brilliant. Especially for someone of her age."
" Fantastic
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,10,"Very rich and accurate movie, surely my favourite of Christopher Nolan."
" Best movie I've ever watched
",2018-04-20 00:00:00,10,Unfortunately I didn't watch it in cinema. That was one of my worst mistakes. I thought this film is not a bid deal. I was wrong. Very wrong.
" Interstellar: One of the future classics
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,9,"This movie must be included in a ""Classic Movies of All Times""."
" It's not just the movie. It's the whole 3 hours experience.
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,10,"Thank you director Nolan, for this beautiful masterpiece. I know that you are not alone so i also want to say ""thank you"" to everybody involved in Interstellar filming. This is THE BEST MOVIE today from all aspects. I can't find better movie than Interstellar. I am surprised how Interstellar only won Best Visual Effects oscar. Interstellar deserves more than just one oscar. I hope that this movie will get more recognition in future. This movie is way ahead its time.Speaking about movie itself, i can say that Interstellar is beautiful emotional journey through unknown. I enjoyed watching this movie and i am still enjoying rewatching it again and again. It was not just the movie, it was life changing (at some level) experience. Leaving your family for greater good, not seeing your daughter last time before you leave, emotional goodbye, great acting and many more things (i don't wanna spoil too much) makes Interstellar special. And Interstellar also has special place in my heart. It will always have a special place in my heart.Just watch the movie and you will see why i gave 10/10. I rarely give 10 stars but this is an exception. Prepare for onion cutting.BTW i am hoping that some fool in future won't remake this masterpiece.Greetings - Stellar Interactive."
" So tired of fake positive reviews
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,6,"I finally watched this movie, only because it had received glowing reviews.But after the first 15 minutes of very boring, sub-standard scenes I realised I had been duped by yet another case of fake positive reviews.At best, this is an okay film to watch with your kids. It contains a few heartwarming messages about love and loyalty, and it tries hard to impress with astrophysics. Unfortunately, the film completely fails to deliver any likeable characters and the science is dubious at best. It's basically an unbelievable, oddly paced, weirdly written science fantasy filled with annoying people that you won't care about because they aren't developed at all. It's certainly not a masterpiece and it's definitely not worth recommending or seeing twice."
" 10/10
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,10,"This movie deserve all my respect, its perfect.
Im sure you will love it."
" The end of Earth will not be the end of us...
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar is one movie you can never forget. The movie is mind bending and gets you thinking. The idea was marvelously thought out and deserves to be seen by many. There are twists, ups, downs, and even sides to sides. Enough to keep you on the edge of your seat! This film really explores the idea of space time continuum with great acting performances by Matthew Mcconaughey and supporting actress Anne Hathaway. A great sci-fi film for the centuries. Watch Interstellar and figure the puzzle for yourself as you will certainly be blown away by the sheer magic of this film!""We used to look up at the sky and wonder at our place in the stars, now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt.""-Cooper, Interstellar"
" A film I wish I loved
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,4,"As someone who loves sci fi, esepcially philosophical sci-fi, I was looking forward to interstellar. And for the first half of the movie I was ready to call it a masterpiece. It was engaging and ejoyable on a surface level, but it also had great themes. I can't call the cinematography anything less than perfect, the score less than entrancing and the performances less then great. The writing is scientifically accurate and well defines the Murph family, but everyone else is given typical Nolan characteristics, in that there too serious to have a personality. But that didn't bother me too much. The whole concept of Cooper having to, in a way choose between his family and the whole universe is interesting and explores human natural and love. It's just a shame then that they can't follow this theme through. Then there is one particular scene. I believe it is after they enter the wave planet. Anne Hathaway talks about love, and how it is everything. This speech is my biggest problem with the movie. The film wants to suggest somehow that his love for his family is key to solving the crisis on Earth. This doesn't really make sense and is not deep. The whole love thing being important becomes very prevelant in the film, but I think it isn't deep at all. Love being important can be summarised in a sentence, but the importance of love can be analysed. It isn't. If you don't care about philosophical elements of the film that's fine but the film keeps bringing back to it. I can turn my brain off in a movie, but when you ask me to think and I think what you're saying is stupid, then you have made a mistake. The whole ice planet scene and Matt Damon being introduced is just unneccessary. Yeah, Damon is the opposite to McCaughnehey in terms of ideals, but we don't need a villain. We don't need a fight scene and a villain like him. He's supposed to be a villain that we think is crazy but we ultimately find him to be relatable, however he just comes across as selfish. Wouldn't it be better if say Hathaway was constantly budding heads with Cooper, and then made a rash decision to try to go back to Earth that cost the crew and led to the docking scene? Rather than forced villain that prevents us from thinking and sympathising with his motives we would be able to philosiphise the situation. The ending is what gets me the most. You've probably heard all the criticism. It being a huge Ex-Machina is not my problem (although it is definitely). I think the ending betrays what the movie was building up to. Instead of leading to an answer or something that gives us more clues or ideas, it leads us to a scene that is obviously meant to pointlessly 2001 style enter this new dimension and conclude that love controls and binds everything. How deep. The ending being an ex-machina doesn't bother me for it being a huge coincidence, but it really doesn't make sense to end like this. Although I don't like the time scene, it is a perfect way to end the movie. The audience anticipates an outcome that they think about. They think about the ending which the movie should do, but once we know everything, what do we think about? I think the scene should've ended by showing Cooper reaching out to Murph to tell her to tell him not to go on the mission, and she responds, changing time in a way that is very vague so we don't really get what happens. Human desires could be explored better, but I see them as only partially shown, in a way where I see essays written about them that I feel were evaluated after analysing every scene. If it is shown only a bit then we can't explore it, and as such it can't be as philosophical ad pure sci-fi as say the golden standard 2001. It is enjoyable, but that is all Interstellar will ever be to me. Good but not great."
" MASTERPIECE
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,10,"'Interstellar' isn't just movie this is one of the Nolan's masterpieces. If you like sci-fi this is the best movie ever. Actors, Soundtracks, Moments everything is perfect. This is the first time I feel the movie. I watch it 10 times and I realize that if you want to get the movie, every detail of it, it is not enough to watch only once. 
 Hans Zimmer's melodies are just amazing, suggests every situation of the movie perfectly. Intensify moments and you feel like you are in the movie and start feeling movie, not watching. 
 Also this movie is about Communication between father and daughter, how they love each other, how they want to be together.
Just watch this masterpiece!"
" Best Sci-fi film I've ever seen!
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,10,It's such a brilliant and profound idea to redefine the power of love to against scientific facts! Nolan totally nailed it!
" An Brilliant Movie
",2018-04-14 00:00:00,10,"I don't had the chance to see this movie before, just watched few days before and again i watched Interstellar yesterday. Wow what a make! Christopher Nolan sir again proved that he is the intelligent movie maker ever again. Every single frame of this movie is awesome.The emotion scene, when cooper returns to the ranger after escaping from the giant wave, learning that 23 years passed - was an amazing emotional sequence. What a acting!There is nothing confusing in this movie. Everything is clean and clear. The Wormhole, Black Hole Horizon, 5th dimensional world all are fantastic really fantastic.It is one of the best Sci-Fi movie."
" Nolan's best
",2018-04-09 00:00:00,10,"In my opinion Nolan's best work. When a movie is better than the likes of Inception, The Prestige and The Dark Knight trilogy, that is saying something!"
" The future of humanity
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,10,"I love the adventure, sacrifice, and special effects in this space traveling sci-fi! I hope there's a sequel!"
" Really liked it!
",2018-04-06 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the most epic movies I have ever watched. The music, the acting, picture, story, everything was amazing! In my personal opinion this is a must-see movie."
" Masterful
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,10,"I personally love this movie. there were lots of things that were just so good and so little that was bad.The plot in this movie was phenomenal. Most people have already seen this movie so i wont lay out the plot.The acting from Matthew McConaughy, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, and even Matt Damon was really good. Of course, since this is the acting section of my review, the smaller roles also did a good job in the movie. John Lithgow is by far one of my favorite actors in this movie. the person playing Coopers son was really good, and all three of the the people who played Murph were really good. they all helped to make an interesting world. The set and costume design was exultant. The people back on earth had more advanced technology than us but at the same time it was less advanced. The spaceship, Millers planet, and Manns planet were also all well built and put together.The music, being designed for this movie, was overwhelmingly good. The sounds of space were also put in very well, since space has no sound, neither did the shots in space. Matt Damon is my last point. He is by far one of my most hated actors because, among other things, I don't like him as a person or actor, but he did a really good job in this movie. not only that but the marketing for this movie was also phenomenal. He was not on any poster, in any trailer, or at any of the events surrounding this movie which made it for a tremendous surprise that he should up in this movie, for fans and non-fans alike. I give this movie a solid 10/10 because i have enjoyed it so many times even after i understand all of it. The only flaw i can see in this movie is that it wants to be so much like 2001: A Space Odyssey but at the same time it doesn't. I fell like it made itself different enough though."
" Brilliant Watch
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,10,"I finally got round to watching this movie, 4 years after to came out and it definitely lived up to the hype! It's essentially a love story between a father and his children; and the guilt he carries with him whilst going on a mission across space and time, to help save a dying planet Earth. But with space's time relatively being warped, (after he's travelled through a black), every hour spent in this new galaxy, is equal to 7 years back on earth. And it fears he'll never make it back before his kids die, or even back at all. There are lots of sub-plots to this film too, which I won't ruin. But to make it clear, this isn't a typical ""lost in space movie"". It's moving and sad at times! Which makes it a bloody good and unique sci-fi movie!The acting is also superb in the film, particular by Matthew McConnagy, Jessica Chastain and the young actress who plays Jessica, as a young kid.Brilliant sci-fi movie and the best I've see in years."
" A masterpiece ! An epic ! Reaching the stars and beyond !
",2018-03-27 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar is a magnum opus on interstellar space travel by Christopher Nolan. While for many it may appear to be more like a science-fiction movie, the movie depicts one of the futuristic possibilities of the state of mankind, trying to explore and reach habitable planets in search of a second home. It shares its theme partially with another space fiction masterpiece ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1961). The movie hits all the right chords with regards to depiction of emotion, passion, determination, desperation and sacrifice. The movie begins slow but gathers pace and steam as the plot uncovers, making sense of everything that happens. The audio-visual effects are simply mesmerizing and one of the best in recent times. And the science may surely be head-scratching for some.While for some the science of black holes, space-time and extra-dimensions may go over the head, but Nolan keeps it engaging nevertheless and leaves the audience in awe of the visuals and thrill of space adventure. The review of this movie shall be incomplete without the appreciation of the background score by Hans Zimmer. Emerging as one of the best partnerships in film industry, the combined geniuses of Nolan-Zimmer create goosebumps for sure. This movie is a must watch for all, especially space and science enthusiasts. The viewer is sure to gain some insights into the cosmos, and engage in some healthy discussion about the Hows and Whys in the movie plot with co-viewers."
" Rubbish
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,1,"I found this pretentious crap. After some 80 years of being addicted to movies and being a fan of Science Fiction from the days of Astounding and Galaxy, very few films have lived up to expectations. ""2001"""" the best of the lot. The mix of sugared family relations and hand-on-the wheels spaceship driving like a racing car plus some probably very expensive gadgetry was too boring for me, sorry, I did not last the fulll length and had to find my own wormhole like fast forward to the finish."
" Maybe
",2018-03-24 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies I've seen, for the fantasy lovers. I watched movie at the cinema, in that moment I thought that this is the best movie I ever watched,sound effects fabulous, acting so good, effects are awesome and the story line is amazing"
" What A Journey
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,10,"I watched this film twice at the cinema when it was released and many more times on Blu Ray sinceEach time I am taken on one amazing journey across the universe, yes the last 20 mins of the film is a bit bonkers but I didn't mind in the least. As much as the film is about space travel we see the emotional journey and connection between father and daughter, and everytime I watch this I am moved by the pain both go through of being apart. To me this is one of the best Sci Fi films made in recent years"
" Think about the future today.
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,9,One of the best Nolan's films. I love the message of this masterpiece! We definitely have to think about our future!
" Got an account just go give this movie 1/10
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,1,"That's right. What an horrible movie. Don't know what's worse, the pathethic acting from almost everyone (Damon won the price tho for insignificant character) or the robots with graphics similar to ""Cop"" from 1988. HOW can so much people enjoyed this? The first two hours is a total sleepfest, until the twist at the end where at least something happen that's interesting and not pointless."
" Good but not Great
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,7,"As far as cinematography and visuals, this movie was stunning. Whether it be on earth, in space, or an alien planet, you will be in awe of what you see. Gorgeous landscapes, horizons, and star fields never got old to look at. There wasn't a time in which I was disappointed with what I was taking in. The two ""alien planets"" in which we visit are detailed, intricate, and overall visually appealing. The ocean planet was impressive, and really was believable as a planet completely covered in water. The ""Hoth"" planet was also nice, giving us precarious ice cliffs, vasts deserts of barren snow, and frozen clouds. The whole movie I couldn't stop looking around the screen, and just thinking. ""Damn.""Acting performances. Apart from my somewhat dislike of Cooper's character, be it poor writing, or not-so-great acting, most of the roles in this movie are wonderfully acted. Also - SURPRISE! Matt Damon is in this movie! and so is Topher Grace! and Casey Affleck! I was pleasantly surprised each time a new cast member came out, performed by an actor that was nowhere to be seen on any promotional information or trailers. From a combination of the writing for most of the characters, and being well acted, there is very good character development and these characters help drive the plot. The big thing I got from this movie was emotions. emotions, emotions, emotions. I really felt for these people, and felt involved in this story.How about robots? I absolutely loved the robots in Interstellar. TARS being the ""main"" and CASE being another, just not quite as cheeky. All of the dialogue between these AI controlled monolith styled robots and the humans is wonderful. I loved the talk about changing there settings for humor and truth etc. From the beginning when TARS is first introduced, you feel uneasy about him. The way it walks...acts around people, talks naturally, and has an attitude, leads you to think that maybe he could be the typical ""AHHH ROBOTS ATTACK"" but this is not the CASE(Ha. Get it?). I digress...The design of these monolithic machines is fantastic. Their articulating and nearly fractal way that they can manipulate and interact was smart, and logical.Now we come to the part of the review where I complain. A lot.Plot holes. This movie is riddled with plot holes. Some minuscule, some big. From the beginning of the film, you are left wondering...While you don't necessary have to know the year it takes place, it just kept nagging in the back of my mind for the entirety that the film is focused on Earth. Another thing is the reason each selection of crops keeps dying. There was some word they were using, but I can't remember it. Despite the name they call it, they never fully explain what exactly it is, or why it's happening. Even just a blip of exposition would satisfy this massive question that really drives the whole movie. There's also reverse plot holes. (That's a thing, right? Maybe we could call them ""Plot Wholes"") There's a lot of extra time and exposition explaining things that...really aren't integral to the plot of the movie...or anything at all. The science in the movie also has holes...sometimes. For the most part, nearly all the science is sound. However there are some things that just aren't right, which I can for the most part let go of, for the sake of an easier to make movie, and more entertaining than a big science lecture(Which it also has plenty of, mind you). I won't go into detail about all the not-so-accurate science things, but some of the placement of planets around a black hole don't match up with what it would actually be like. Near the end of the film, the plot decides to take a detour from the fairly logical and scientific stance most of the film has been. We get thrust into a black hole, and stretched out into another dimension, viewing time as a physical entity, as moving left and right. This is interesting...and explains a few questions I had had since the beginning. I wasn't a huge fan of this last 30 minutes or so, as it felt cheap and like they just rushed the last bit as they didn't know what to do(despite the movie being a whopping 3 hours long). I also had a bit of a problem with the fact that the ""THEY"" everyone was talking about throughout the film, made to seem like an alien race, was actually just highly evolved humans from the super future. Who changed the past, to let us go out and explore. and become highly evolved...to go back...you see where this is going. A PARADOX. Or just a use of the less used time travel idea that time is a circle and travelling in time is set, and what has happened, happened, and what will happen, will happen, no matter what.I could go on and on and on about too much emotion and bogged down story tropes and that bloody long run time, but that's enough mad ramblings for one post.Overall, I thought that this was a well rounded film. Visually stunning, scientifically interesting, and although there are some plot holes and a few less-than-stellar acting performances, this movie is sure to entertain. Especially viewed in it's native 70mm Imax. Visuals: 10/10
Acting: 7/10
Writing: 6/10
Direction: 7/10Overall: 7/10"
" Pure perfection
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,10,This movie is simply put the most brilliant piece of cinematography i have ever come across. Everything from the storytelling to the special effects are just mind boggling. Do yourself a favor and see it. You won't regret it.
" Best sci-fi movie I have ever seen
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,9,"Christopher Nolan is mu favorite director. And what I like about him is that his movies are very deep and emotional Interstellar is a great movie built on a very complexe story . It has something special that other movies don't have like:
The background music made by Hans Zimmer 
The great visual effects 
Special cast 
And many more...
The script is very well written thanks to Jonathan Nolan . The development of the relationship between a father and his daughter makes the film even more intersting . It's full of suspense and mysteries Christopher Nolan proved himself once more and Interstellar is an achievement that marked the sci-fi movies categories"

" Did I miss something?
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,1,"Firstly, I am a big Nolan fan and love his previous work - The Prestige and Memento are in my books - story visually told as its best.I was excited about Interstellar, To tell a story about possibly the greatest adventure achieved by humans is no easy task. Can someone explain to an idiot like me what I don't understandIn hindsight, this was like watching a soap opera between father and daughter. For someone who cares about his daughter so much has no problem running over the crops she'll need to feed off tomorrow.Send the same guy into space with embryo's - he is going to raise them as his own right? Humans can't take care of themselves at infancy, we know that - so someone has to.Speaking of sending, how the hell does NASA build a rocket underground with no pilot planned to take the helm of saving the human species.The not so intelligent humans from the future (5th? dimension) kindly tore open a wormhole next to Saturn, wait what? Thats 2 years away!! The wormhole scene - looked fantastic!Let get to the other side of space - Not a single reaction from any of our three astronauts who has just travelled the cosmos - not a single moment spent admiring a black hole, or looking around to see whats what around you.To planet H2O - loved the huge wave scene. Kill someone off who is stupid enough to let nature take his life over the sight of a wave.The bookshelf scene was plain stupid, I get it - he is in the 4th dimension so everything is always happening at the same time. pushing strings in an attempt to push a book of a shelf, wait isn't this in a parallel universe - so its another Murph? his own Murph has already passed that time - I am confused here. Have you a seen a picture of a black hole made by Nasa which represents the data they've collected from their telescopes? There is a vortex above and below it - spewing out everything it chews up. Its common sense to say a black hole leads you nowhere apart from destruction. I won't even go into the Matt damon Scene - could have easily shaved off 30mins of the already 'lost interest' in the movie.Eureka - Murph found out how to control gravity... Don't just say Eureka then forget about it! We're all dying to know, make some BS up at least to keep us entertained! BS sure but keep is logicalskipping forward, 110 years later with planet Earth dying and with the lack of resources, they've still managed to leave earth and colonise a moon near Saturn. 50 years later and we haven't colonised crap on our own moon!Besides, I thought CooP used up the last rocket NASA had in his 'save the humans' mission?Daddy comes home since after all, Being with his daughter has been his whole goal through out the movie. Clearly he went on his own motives which happens to be more important than the most important thing in his life - yup, and her name is Murph.Then Murph says, great to see you - Bye!! Wait what?Let me ask, Is he dead after the black hole? so everything after is a hallucination? sorry but a big disappointment for me... Even if just from an entertainment perspective, it was a huge bore. I'd rather watch Justice League, no wait.. err maybe I would"
" The Tesseract!
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,10,"Christopher Nolan's films demand second and third viewings. I watched Interstellar two times in two days.I even bought the book ""The Science Behind Interstellar"" by Kip Thorne so I could understand the complexity of this movie. Movies that earn a perfect 10 score must stimulate my mind and ignite my fiercest curiosity after watching them. This was the most fascinating movie I've ever seen in terms of visuals, storyline, science and technology and the power of love.I'm a sucker for non-linear plots and this is Nolan's best use of that device. I read that Nolan is inspired by M.C. Escher's graphic works, you know, the guy with the impossible staircase and visual riddles. Knowing that definitely helps you figure visualize the trajectory of the film's plot and timelines.From what I've read in ""The Science Behind Interstellar"" this movie is mostly scientifically accurate and is the perfect analogy to describe gravity's effect on time and the theory of relativity.The moment Cooper leaves the blackhole and is ejected from this ship into space was beyond terrifying. But then Cooper enters the tesseract, which stands out as the most confused and horrified I've ever been in a film. Seriously, it's the coolest moment in film I've ever seen, especially when the tesseract collapses. If you're a fan of sacred geometry, or geometry in general, it's pure eye candy. Interstellar is currently my favorite and most impressive film I've ever seen to date. Oh yeah, and Hans Zimmer killed it with the soundtrack. There's a YouTube clip with Zimmer and Nolan at a cathedral recording the massive sounding church organ. The organ was chosen because it represented man's desire to reach the divine (church music) as well as the organ being the most sophisticated instrument of the 19th century, perhaps 18th century. Ok, enough said."
" One of the most beautiful movie I ever saw
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,10,"I could write about it for years without managing to describe how I felt while watching Interstellar. I am a huge fan of Nolan, whom may be the best current director: I thought I had seen his best in Inception, which already blew my mind. And then Interstellar happened. 
Firstly, everything Nolan touches becomes gold. Not only visual gold, but emotional gold when this one is priceless. Beyond the beautiful pictures, the uttely beautiful soundtrack (breathtaking use of the organ), there is this incredibly beautiful story. Interstellar is not a film about stars, skies and space, but about humanity, both its weaknesses and strenghts. It simply talks about the human condition, always wonders in a discreet way why humanity does exist and why it should be preserved : it is a hymn to mankind, almost in a religious way. The 3 hours of film pass by without us noticing, until the ends credits. Then you suddenly awake, dry your tears (I cried for half of the movie) and remain silent for a while - as even as slighly talk could destroy this emotion, endless poetry that the movie left. 
This also gives us Hans Zimmer as his best. Interstellar would be nothing without this bewitching soundtrack.
I saw very few movies like this one. It SHOULD have won the best film Oscar, as it is one of the greatest masterpieces of this century to me. Thank you, Nolan."
" It Was Like The Film Merged With Another Version From Parallel Earth
",2018-03-12 00:00:00,8,"So I have to say that this film had awesome visual effects and a chilling musical score which did get a bit repetitive in some points of the film. The film also had a mostly good cast, however they were a few disposable characters who were not really needed and were just there to kill off, such as Matt Damon was pretty wasted. The concept of the film was good with a brilliant distopian future setting, however after the first 3 quarters of the film, WTF! what was going on, it was like the main guy was Jumping through parallel universes it was that complicated, i could barley understand the conclusion of the film as well. Did like the time dilatation stuff as that was rather cool. I would only recommend this film to people with high intelligence, i normally understand fairly complicated stories, but if the produces thought this film wasn't complicated, they must be having a laugh."
" 2hr 45min of Perfection!!!
",2018-03-12 00:00:00,10,"I wanted to write a review for so long, but had to take my time to come up with the right words. I am doing this partly for self-preservation but mainly due to the sheer brilliance which the film offers. I am very happy to be able to witness this masterpiece and sad at the same time knowing that we might have to wait long to witness another film like Interstellar.My obsession started almost 12 years ago, when Interstellar was listed on Steven Spielberg's filmography with a synopsis saying exploring Wormholes, Time-Dilation, Interstellar travel and everything else which Kip Thorne's theories explores! I was watching this space like a hawk, only it never moved past that one dedicated page on IMDB. Almost 12 years later, Spielberg opts out and Christopher Nolan steps in and the project kicks off. I was actually surprised on how quickly they pulled this off. Stuck in development for over a decade and then gets completed in just a year, that is amazing speed. However, I was a bit sceptical especially after reading the leaked script on IMDB which included Chinese robots on far abandoned planet with gravity controlling devices, etc. it seemed like containing strong doses of sci-fi and less of the theories which could be possible one day. But thank god, the script was just a decoy and the movie takes the right direction. It brilliantly explores the possibilities of interstellar travel at the same time keeping the nature and relationships which human's share at its core. Now that is quite the balance and with such complex script, if done wrongly, this movie could have been a disaster. But Christopher Nolan helms this with utter confidence and brings in the master composer, Hans Zimmer on board. Zimmer delivers the most brilliant and original score which perfectly gels with every scene, every sentence spoken and every silent and non-silent moment. It's really a shame that this man did not win an Oscar since Lion King even after being nominated for gems like Sherlock Holmes, Inception and Dunkirk. I don't think anyone else could have done a better job for Interstellar. I really want Nolan and Zimmer to make Interstellar 2!!Coming to the movie, I really don't want to talk about the plot as this is done in every other piece written about this movie, instead I would like to state why I was in awe for the entire run-time. I always was a huge fan of science-fiction, both ""Star Wars"" kind and ""Contact"" kind. There is always something fascinating about not just mentally visualising but actually seeing things which probably are not going to be possible in our lifetime. Travelling through a worm-hole and entering another galaxy is right on top of that list. And this film does that so brilliantly that there is no room for wanting more. Kip Thorne's presence as a scientific adviser solidifies the liberties which the film can take. So Interstellar has the right doses of science and science-fiction blended together. Time-Dilation was another concept which I eager to see after watching an episode of Brian Cox explaining theory of relativity. This is brilliantly portrayed in the film when the team visits Miller's planet. An hour there equals 7 Earth years. Wow, scientists must have lost their minds when Einstein stated and verified this theory in 1905!! Another thing which Interstellar and many other films take for granted and show simplistically are the hibernation pods. Sleeping and waking up in one piece after decades/centuries opens up so many wonderful possibilities. Wish that was as simple and real as these films portray. I know we just perfected the ""Sleeping"" bit but the waking up process if for future mankind. Wish we could get there sooner.And then the epic Event Horizon and Singularity. This is where the films takes its liberties for dramatisation purposes. Still it is exciting visualising time as a physical dimension and being able to scroll through one's time-line as if it was the songs list on our iPhones!So Interstellar satisfies all our wildest space-exploration dreams, in the most realistic way possible and for this reason alone, this film will be number one spot on my list! Coming to the cast, everyone fits like a glove to the script. I loved Matthew McConaughey in Contact and he does the same brilliant job here as well, bringing all his on-screen charisma. Other noteworthy mentions are Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain, they played their parts to utmost perfection. And Of-course Mackenzie Foy, who played the younger role of Murph with finesse. Finally, this movie is as good as realistic sci-fi gets and we might have to probably wait for a long time to witness another epic like this. Sigh!!"
" Good film but not that good

",2018-03-08 00:00:00,10,"This movie is the only sci-fi movie where I felt that was more a science movie than a science fiction movie. It also made me think a lot about some of its content, even though most of its content is not real I really felt that it was related to real scientific

" Interpersonal
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,9,"Nice movie to interact with and then at some point let go and let your inner ponder and wonder out. Cause and effect is displayed very well in this movie making it a good movie to see again just to sip it like fine wine. The earth is dying but mankind has other plans and so it goes with twists, turns and mysteries mixed with human nature hope and space exploration. This is where it gets interesting. Of planets there are no end but what kind are they? This movie touches on that. We learn that Earth is perfect as planets go because everything fits so nicely and holds for billions of years and supports multi-life forms (diversity) which boggle the mind. Finding this elsewhere is not that easy even if you have trillions of choices as we are led to believe in this movie. Good entertainment, visuals and who doesn't like a good space story mixed with time elements plus mankind is running out of time movie? Here it is. make this...."
" The Roar of Classic Science Fiction Reduced to A Dull Whine
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,3,"INTERSTELLAR is a movie I had to watch over and over because I'm a substitute teacher, and whenever this certain science teacher is absent he makes me show it to his slower classes. That's a bad sign, don't you think?This movie is so boring compared to the classic science fiction movies I grew up with, like THE OMEGA MAN starring Charlton Heston. And yet it's funny, because the opening situation is much the same. It's a post-catastrophe environment, where technology has failed and mankind has gone back to a more primitive, tribal way of living. Only there's this one scientist who still believes in science and thinks he can bring mankind back from the brink with technology and courage. And when the society that's left finds out about his attitude it's big trouble!Well, that's where the comparison falls apart. In THE OMEGA MAN the last surviving scientist is a bad ass, with an arsenal of weapons, an awesome bachelor pad, a fleet of sharp sports cars, and a cocky, man about town attitude somewhere between Joe Namath and Hugh Hefner. Each day he fights a one man war against hundreds of mad mutants who want him dead!In INTERSTELLAR the last surviving scientist is a boring shlub who mopes around on a small farm worrying about next year's wheat crop or something. Each day he fights a one man war against a couple of narrow-minded teachers who want him to admit the NASA moon landings were fake. In THE OMEGA MAN the stakes are high. Neville and his sworn enemy Matthias are playing for keeps. Every night. Gun battles, ambushes, people getting burned at the stake. In INTERSTELLAR the stakes are pitiful. Kids flunking at school, drones crashing in cornfields, the high school principal vaguely hinting that the hero's lifeless son ""might be happier as a farmer."" Oh no! And as I said, the flaky thing is, both movies basically explore the same conflict between the scientist's need to know and society's need to keep from knowing. But one movie is full of explosive action, and high drama, while the other one is full of cheap sentiment and melodrama. The contrast between INTERSTELLAR and THE OMEGA MAN reminds me of Mary McCarthy's famous remark about Arthur Miller's DEATH OF A SALESMAN, and in particular the climactic ""attention must be paid"" speech. Mary McCarthy said that it was ""the roar of the old Left theater, reduced to a dull whine.""INTERSTELLAR is the roar of Seventies science fiction reduced to a dull whine."
" I love this movie
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,9,"This movie has a very great soundtrack. The parts where the camera is in space nail the ""you can't hear anything in space"" affect. The shots were amazing. TARS' CGI was perfect. Overall, this movie was great and I hope you guys watch it."
" Epic fail
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,4,INTERSTELLAR is emotional and well acted but lacking substance: I DON'T KNOW WHAT THIS FILM WAS ABOUT! Space travel? Interdimensional travel? It's also bleak. 'Contact' (1997) was a similar but much better. Christopher Nolan's best film was 'Insomnia' (2002); 'Batman Begins' (2005) wasn't bad either. 'Inception' (2010) was another Christopher Nolan film I didn't think much of (turned it off) because like Interstellar I'm not sure what it was about; so much going on on the surface; so complex and sophisticated but also empty and convoluted.

" Interstellar
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,9,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerI recently watched this movie on TV for the third time and just had to write a review for it. So here it is.First off, Christopher and Jonathon Nolan has created a complex and inspired story with some very powerful and emotional moments. The story is told slowing but in a way that makes us connect with the genuine and well made characters. The scientific side of the story can be hard to understand but after a second or third viewing everything becomes clear. The amount of foreshadowing and the plot twist are what make the film great. The story is powerful and is Nolan's 3rd best film (The Dark Knight is #1 and Memento is #2).The acting is amazing. Matthew McConaughey gives one of his greatest performances ever. He bring such emotion and raw power to the screen. Jessica Chastain, David Gyasi, Wes Bentley, Michael Caine, and John Lithgow all perform well. Anne Hathaway performs the worst. She is very bland and I have never been a fan of hers anyway.The pacing can seem slow to some, but the story takes its time to tell the story and introduce us to the science and the characters. The runtime is very long at a staggering 2 hours and 49 minutes long. But like I said, the story takes its time to develop ands keeps you involved.The CGI in the film is amazing. Space looks beautiful yet daunting. It looks peaceful yet terrifying.Pros: Inspired story, great use of foreshadowing and a great plot twist, emotional moments, complex science, amazing acting by Matthew McConaughey, good overall acting, good CGI, slow pacing in order to let the story develop, and a slightly unresolved endingCons: Anne Hathaway's dry performance, the pacing can be seen as slow and the runtime is very longOverall Rating: 9.2P.S. Much like Blade Runner 2049, the film takes its time to introduce the world and characters in a deep and complex way. Both films expect the audience to want to be involved in the process of telling the story."
" A Film Which Will Transcend Generations
",2018-03-03 00:00:00,10,"So many people have already reviewed this film, but after my most recent viewing, I now feel compelled to write a review as well. Films like ""Interstellar"" come along very rarely; but when they do, they transcend generations. This film, deep down, is about love and how it can penetrate barriers we didn't even know existed. While the science behind this film may not be completely accurate, the concept is spot on; Nolan's writing compels us to see the value in the most confusing and powerful of all emotions which human beings share. I simply cannot applaud him enough for bringing us a story which teaches a real lesson about the human condition. He also brings us a story that can be enjoyed on many different levels; if you aren't one for the sentimental stuff, then take solace in the fact that there is plenty of thrilling moments within this film. If you want an intense sci-fi experience, then this will certainly deliver; however, it is my feeling that this story is about much more than the end of the world and space travel. Thus, those who seek a deeper meaning will be rewarded as well. The acting in this film is nothing short of sensational; Matthew McConaughey is brilliant, simply put. This movie, along with ""Dallas Buyers Club"", have significantly changed my opinion of him as an actor. His recent body of work clearly shows that he is more than just an attractive rom-com star. Anne Hathaway also delivers a great performance, and showed range that I did not know she had. Perhaps the best of them all, though, is Mackenzie Foy as 10-year old Murph. Her performance was so genuine that it moved me emotionally, which is something that doesn't often happen for me in movies. There are many other noteworthy performances as well; I could go on and on. This film has some of the best supporting actors in the business (Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, ect...). Lastly, i'll touch on the plot. While it can be boiled down to a few simple constructs, overtly it is quite complex. It may take a few viewings to truly digest everything that happens in this film, but I think this is one of the things that makes it so great. Not unlike Nolan's other masterpiece, ""Inception"", one can take away different things from each new play through of ""Interstellar"". This, along with the themes of survival, love, humanity, and faith are ultimately why I think this movie will go down as one of the greatest of all time (and transcend generations to come).Ultimately, this film isn't perfect; it very close, however, and the flaws that it has can easily be overlooked by everything it does well. While the sentimental undertones or the extreme science fiction backdrop may be a bit too much for some (those familiar with quantum mechanics may find it a bit too unrealistic), I think most who view this will find it remarkable. Christopher Nolan continues to revolutionize cinema with his bold stories and ideas, and ""Interstellar"" is yet another notch on his belt. Don't miss this one folks, as it will most certainly be a film that resonates with generations to come."
" Can watch again and again and again
",2018-03-03 00:00:00,10,"Christopher Nolan wants us to think big. As in big ideas on a big screen.
Very interesting and very well directed sci-fi movie.
The best thing about Interstellar is that, like Inception, the science and the ideas are as real, as sophisticated, and as advanced, as any ideas out there. If you see a critic or somebody saying this is convoluted or overly complex that says more about their lack of understanding than about the movie. We should be thrilled Nolan is thinking about and making movies about these things. Bravo."
" Thankfully a great Sci-Fi Movie!!!
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,10,"For those who who love sci-fi, that isn't about monsters; who wonder what's beyond us; who like a good movie that makes you think, challenges your intellect and leaves you wanting more or thinking what happens (it has that kind of ending); and if you analyze everything like I do, its a good puzzle to try and solve. I highly recommend this movie! Watch when you have the time to truly pay attention with little distractions."
" Rebuild the Golden age of cinematography
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,10,"The idea itself so deep in many different ways.
Nolan grap the emotions and the relationship between a father and his daughter and transfer it in a sci-fi movie and ooohhhhh the 5 dimensions scene OMG.
but interstellar is easier to understand rather than Inception , the movie has a lot of science theories that you can look at it and study it and you will the match with 100% accuracy."
" I enjoyed every frame!!
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar is a brilliantly well done film. I've been a huge fan of Nolan's work for as long as I can remember, and this is another amazing film!"
" Age Inducing Boredom
",2018-02-23 00:00:00,3,"This must be one of Nolan's most boring films despite its high intentions. Matthew McConaughey seemed as fake as ever in this movie and hated his accent (my subjective opinion) and the dialogue was as real as mickey mouse. When the time came to watch footage of his aging children, from his spaceshp, and he cried profusely, I took the hint and stopped watching.
There were a couple effects to behold and initially the story seemed intriguing. However after one hour of watching this drivel I really felt like I was wasting my time. Also felt there was no chemistry between actors as well, nothing to hold the film together not even the spaceship.
The final solution and the way our hero enters into the 5th dimension is hilarious rather than intriguing. Contact was a much better film on an emotional and metaphysical level than this well made snoozefest."
" Broadening your perspective by Great Experience
",2018-02-21 00:00:00,9,"You will see infinite posibilities in Sci-Fi films.It's like kinda mixture tone of The Abyss, Armageddon, and 2001: A Space Odyssey."
" A decent cinematographic fable
",2018-02-20 00:00:00,7,"I spent a good time watching Interstellar, although to be so I needed to constantly remind myself that I wasn't following a realistic story, but rather some sort of fable. The story is repetitively implausible.There's an ex NASA pilot who hasn't trained in years who get himself ready in weeks to undertake an interstellar travel mission. The film makes it look like piloting spaceships is like driving cars. Current NASA missions requires around 5 years of training for one specific mission; enough time for an astronaut to see his children become teenagers. In the future, NASA operates undercover because the government is in denial of the spatial program. Somehow they already have astronauts in another solar system! The idea that an undercover version of NASA could undertake such missions in secret of both logistically and financially absurd. Those are grandiose missions, the kind of which require billions of dollars of funding, thousands of employees, years of research and development, and manufacturing deals with the private sector.Once in space, astronauts explains to each other some aspects for space travel, which is a way for the screenplay to convey such information to the spectator, but which is unfortunately very clumsy because astronauts are supposed to know those things! There is a scene where some astronaut explains to the astronaut played by Anne Hathaway how a wormhole is supposed to work, by folding a piece of paper and making a hole with a pen in it. The character listens in awe because she apparently discovers how that works. This is the kind of explanation that anyone can find in any educative YouTube channel about science. It is unthinkable that an astronaut would not know that, for the simple reason that it would mean such astronaut is catastrophically under-skilled for the mission in the movie.Many aspects of the mission are improvised in space. During one of such improvisation, Cooper, the main character, elaborates a plan by drawing rough lines and circles on a whiteboard, like he was playing some strategy game of something. Everybody agrees that the plan will work and that they're good to go. Such things require very precise calculations, adjustments, checking, double-checking, designing a protocol to ensure everything will go fine, etc. Maybe this development phase of the plan can be considered to be included in an ellipsis, but I find showing the spectator only the whiteboard drawing session to be so coarse.On the science side of things, there are many bizarre things. So-called ""gravitational anomalies"" belong more to the domain of fantasy than of science-fiction. One of the pillar concept of science of that no matter what new discoveries are made, what worked one day continues to work under the same assumptions and limits in the future. This is why we're still using Newton's laws to make calculations on Earth even though Einstein proved them to be incorrect. They're only an extremely good approximation when you don't approach the speed of light, which wasn't even under consideration at the time Newton was alive. This is also why we'll never go faster than the speed of light under conditions in which it's currently known to be impossible (which is all conditions we know). So, whatever we discover about black holes I can assure you than the day gravity on the Earth's surface start having anomalies scientists are gonna shit more than bricks.In the movie, there is a wormhole near Saturn. Wormhole are giant celestial bodies that are supposed to be taking thousands of years to form. I didn't feel like the film was set in thousands of years. It would mean they look back at the Apollo missions like we look back at the Great Pyramids, which wasn't really the way the movie conveyed the sort of nostalgia about those missions. When the astronauts embark in their spaceship to travel to the wormhole, the film chooses realistic travel speeds and accepts that it takes months (maybe years, I don't remember) to reach out to Saturn, but when they appear on the other side of the hole, in another solar system, then suddenly travel from one planet to another is only a matter of hours.I could probably continue with more and more such paragraphs. While watching the movie I think I made myself such remarks at a rate of about one every 10 minutes. There's just no detail or even no medium-importance plot device that makes sense or is plausible in this movie. Yet somehow I mildly enjoying watching it, for the simple reason that it is a fable. Like in a fable, individual pieces of actions can be implausible, but the point isn't such details, the point is the overall story. Interstellar is the kind of material that should have been developed with care over an entire saga of science-fiction books a thousand pages each, but it's a 3 hours movie instead. At such, it's some sort of science-fiction high-density package of interesting concepts that aren't developed in much deep nor rendered very plausible. But it works on a high-level. You just need to imagine that instead of watching a movie you're listening to Christopher Nolan on a 3 hours road trip telling you about his last big science-fiction idea. You can feel how touching and grandiose it is, it only remains to be actually done."
" Nothing Not to Like in this movie! The music is transcendant
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,10,"I've watched this show many times. Mix time travel across the galaxy and I'm in. Plausible, suspenseful and it may take a few times to get all of the gory details figured out - my kind of a movie."
" Excellent space movie
",2018-02-16 00:00:00,8,"The visuals were amazing. The tech was amazing. It's a great movie for sure. Although I do think they played a little loose with some of the science. Overall, an excellent film and definitely worth re-watching on occasion."
" Masterpiece
",2018-02-14 00:00:00,10,Best movie ever. As usual Nolan did a great work along with Hans Zimmer and his amazing soundtracks.
" goood
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,6,"I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.And this is IT!When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will."
" (Hats Off) x 5, where 5 belongs to 5 dimensions!
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,10,"We have grown up in the age of sci-fi where films like Jurassic park and Godzilla (the previous one) gave us the idea of ongoing growth in Science. Myself being a great fan of such a genre, it added to my pleasure. Now when a decade or two has been passed, it is great to have a movie belonging to the same genre coming from world's greatest director Christopher Nolan.
Christopher is famous for movies like Inception and The Dark Night trilogy as well. Interstellar picks up even in the areas where Inception and The Dark Night trilogy could not. The thriller in inception takes away the touch of reality, also visuals in my opinion were not up to mark (I mostly find it that way if they are built by special effects). On the other hand The Dark Night trilogy belonged to superhero genre, thus it stays away from comparison.
I find no shame in admitting that it took me two times to watch the movie to understand it completely. Also this is my second review after deleting first one. Now all I can say it to be as (Hats Off) x 5, where 5 belongs to 5 dimensions. The story is built by interaction of various interstellar elements like dimensions, black hole, its horizon, relativity, gravity, space, time, worm hole, various worlds, emotions and love. The story is how 'they' from future, interact with present human (probably 'they' from past) to save humanity.
Final verdict: A classic, as it would go down in history."
" What?
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,3,"Ok, I'm a big fan of both Matthew McConaughey and Matt Damon, and this movie had some good acting and good special effects. Some of the story was even believable and interesting, but when it came to that whole book shelf in the worm hole thing - well that just ruined it for me. So let me try to get this straight - did McConaughey go into a black hole or was it a worm hole? And once inside the whatever kind of hole it was, he ended up being outside his spaceship and behind his daughters bookshelf. And then he just suddenly woke up inside a hospital?!?! So who went in the hole to rescue him? I'm sorry, but once the bookshelves came into play, I couldn't figure out what was going on and it didn't make any sense! Plus, McConaughey left Earth when his daughter was a little girl, and when he finally sees her again at the end of the movie, she is very old and near the end of her life. You'd think they'd want to spend some time catching up, but they spend about 2 minutes together and that's it."
" A movie that truly engages the mind.
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,10,"To begin with this film is representative of any dystopian fiction motion-picture with the only difference being truly astonishing cinematography and a subtle hint at a hidden story that engages the viewer. The crisis within the movie which is the source and the base of the plot isn't very well described however this is justified as it is not necessarily relevant to the plot due to the plot being based on a crisis and not on the type of crisis. while this lack of description may be perceived as a flaw in the scripting of the movie I believe it helps this movie be more concise seeing as it is three hours long anyway.
The first scenes before the story unfolds are mainly used to give the viewer an idea of the setting and the characters and seems to be the most criticised part of the movie with comments often describing it as 'boring'. however it only covers 11.7 percent of the film. Once the true story unfolds it begins to engage the cognitive part of the viewer's brain unlike any other sci-fi film i have ever seen by not only presenting logical and scientific problems but also emotional tragedies that engage the empathy of the viewer. 
The story truly unfolds when Cooper goes on his journey and this marks the first emotional challenge in the movie. The movie then goes on to explore ethical challenges in the world and really gives the viewer insight into the thoughts and emotions humans experience when faced with a dilemma as the one presented by 'plan A' and 'plan B'.This dilemma is a classical one of risk more to gain more or risk less but gain less and is something everyone goes through no matter what scale it is on wether it be the immense, immeasurable scale given in this movie or something minor in everyday life. 
Many say that this movie is confusing and hard to understand, however, this is simply because it explores oxymorons and paradoxes that can't be understood with mere logic. One such paradox is time and time is a recurring theme in this movie seemingly representing every challenge humanity faces: the time we have with loved ones and the time we ourselves have. Time is represented as many things and one of them is as a resource, as something that we can see or a fourth dimension - the fourth dimension. Most of this confusion comes from the way time is presented and the ways the movie uses scientific theories and paradoxes to represent time but this is what truly engages the viewer - it is the reason why the movie can be three hours long, it's because it presents mental challenges that can keep a viewer engaged for days and not just a mere three hours.
Overall, this movie is a masterpiece: it is not only a movie with impressive effects but one that combines effects with an ingenious plot. The way time is presented as a tangible dimension can only be classified as astounding considering that time is not something humanity has much expertise with. moreover the beautiful effects of space - especially in panic are mesmerising for example the flooding of sound once a vessel is pressurised are very impressively done. The plot has virtually no holes and it is surprisingly scientifically accurate with the exceptions of concepts regarding black holes. To conclude, the way it presents the unknown is the magic of this movie and that is why I rate 10 stars."
" So good, a new perspective
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,8,"This by far the most amazing science fiction movie i have seen. it explains the possibility of the universe and shows how the space time continuum works on a very high class. a worth while movie, as in India we say ""Paisa wasool movie hai""."
" A Masterpiece
",2018-02-09 00:00:00,10,Best of all is the sound track by Hans Zimmer. This is my new favourite movie and I seriously can't wait to watch it again. And I cannot for the life of me understand all the negative 1 star reviews. Oh how we humans are so different.
" What a movie!
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,10,"I wanted to write a review for this movie for awhile and after watching it again last night I made up my mind.First of all, we are talking about the highest rated movie of the last 7 years and currently the #30 film on the all-time list (hopefully it would go even higher with the passing of the years). It's a big deal right but I wished it was higher, because this is Nolan's best film in my honest opinion, yes better than Inception or any film from The Dark Knight trilogy or The Prestige and Memento, don't get the wrong idea I like all of these films and Nolan has to be my favorite director. I gotta say I was expecting more from Dunkirk and I'm in a way glad that people gave it a lower score compared to most of his other films despite the praise from most of the film critics!Interstellar has to be Nolan's best film, where should I begin from? The score? The story? McConaughey's performance? The Graphics? It was an excellent movie, lasted almost 3 hours but I wish there was more to see."
" It's about all of us.
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,10,"My absolute favorite. It's a pretty difficult movie to talk about, because at first people perceive it as another one of these ""Space Sci-fi stuff"", but oh boy it is so much more... *It's a movie about impossible decisions and situations and how different people face them.*MINOR SPOILER
(Can and should a single human being always think about the common good? What if saving humanity demands sacrificing your own life? A life of a love one? A life of a child?)*It's a movie about human relationships that were never put to a test in such a unique way.*It's a movie about intolerable cowardice and reckless bravery. (No Time for Caution!)*It's a movie about all of us, trying to have it all.*It's a movie about the most hilarious and the most likable rectangles of metal with 90% honesty setting...*It's a movie about permanence and consistency of love. (It is being pictured as a ""Fifth Dimension"", which I don't necessarily like, but it's worth mentioning)*And finally, it's another one of these ""Space Sci-fi stuff""
But boy, it is so much more...P.S. Matthew McConaughey's was, imo, perfect for this role. His overall vibe lets us perceive him as ""one of us"", unlike other schmart people in the space program. 
(MURPH) P.S.S. Hans Zimmer is a genius, I want to have his babies. Watched that movie in 2014, still find myself falling asleep to the tunes of ""Stay"", letting myself go to ""Detach"" and jamming to ""No Time for Caution"".I'm a fan of Oscars and I will forever be in a state of endless sorrow about this movie not being even nominated for Best Picture. (I mean ""Gravity"" gets nominated the year before, cmon now)."
" A Sci-Fi masterpiece added in Nolanography.
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,10,"I've written and read many reviews but when it comes to Nolan, his work is needed to be appreciated always. I really loved the plot of the movie and direction of Nolan (no doubt). This has been always said that Nolan always does his full research to the very extent and by seeing Interstellar he proved this statement.
The role of cooper is very well played by Matthew McConaughey. He did it so well that at the end of the movie you may fell his aggression and frustration. The direction of the movie is so well that no one can take their eyes off fro the screen.
The concept of dimensions, gravity, time differences and worm holes are very well explained.
The use of CGI is so good that you may see it as real. I do and always will love the work of Christopher Nolan."
" Beautifully written and casted
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely love this film. I'm also a fan of Christopher Nolan's films. This movie was genius, the way it was written. The visual effects blow my.mind. I find myself rewinding it every time they go through to the other galaxy.. also, when Cooper ejects his craft and ends up in between I don't know what to call it, I try to imagine myself in that position. Even I, just watching it, was panicked seeing him watching himself leave his daughter from another dimension. The only thing I didn't like was how his character was made to never see his children again. I felt like he didn't have enough emotion towards the realization that he was possibly never going to see them again. I mean ,I'd be crying and freaking out from up there. Of course he had to focus on the problem at hand, but he missed their whole lives. And it didn't seem as if he was remorseful enough in the end when he watched murp on her death bed..I would never have left. I mean, after not seeing her for 23yrs, I'd have talked to her about what really happened and apologize over and over. But that's the way it was written. Of course he actually helped save the world by Morse coding to murph via another dimension with Tars help, but he should have been able to return to earth with his children..on the other hand, it is refreshing to see a movie without happy endings. You know, where the audience is left surprised. Where things don't always work out. A typical ending would be, they returned to earth, he gets back to his kids and they save the world. This movie was awesome because it didn't work that way. But it still bothered me. His daughter and son had a life without him. It's saddening. Didn't like that feeling, but it happens. A very beautiful film."

",2018-02-02 00:00:00,10,"The Shawshank Redemption"" is a movie about time, patience and loyalty -- not sexy qualities, perhaps, but they grow on you during the subterranean progress of this story, which is about how two men serving life sentences in prison become friends and find a way to fight off despair.The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest busload of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while"
" Excellent Movie
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,10,"I judge a movie by how long it takes me to realize I need the bathroom, how long the movie can hold my interest and how convincing the events unfolding are. Well, I watched this movie all the way through with no bathroom breaks. My interest was grabbed from the start and held all the way through. Being old enough, and lucky enough to have watched the premiere of 2001 A Space Odyssey - and viewed it several times since - of course I made comparisons, and there were a few, but this movie tells an excellent stand alone story that is both riveting and believable. I'm not going to give away any secrets but anyone who watches the last five minutes or so without a lump in their throat and a tear in their eye, well you're a critic, you're not enjoying the movie because you're too busy looking for bloopers and faults. Were there bloopers and faults? The darn movie was so riveting if there were any I didn't notice them!"

" Honestly, one of the best, most genius films to date.
",2018-01-25 00:00:00,10,"Filled with amazing effects, beautiful music, great story and perfect acting, we get the movie Interstellar. Christopher Nolan has made what easily is the best movie of 2014.If it was possible, I would have given this film a 17/10. It is truly a special movie with a heart and emotions. A dystopian future f the world, where the only foos source for people, is corn. We need a new planet to survive and that's what the main mission in this movie is. I will never get over how fantastic the music made by Hans Zimmer for this movie is. He used an organ trough the score. ""There's something very human about an organ. It has pipes and air blows through it, it needs to breathe, so there is something very human about it"".10/10 for this movie, definetly deserved. 
Watch it, you won't regret it."
" Beautiful
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,10,"After years of watching this movie, this still remains number one in my heart.
Maybe it was the fact that I experienced it on IMAX 3D that helped form my opinion. I don't know... But the sounds, the visuals... they were incredible. But then again, I'm biased, because I always preferred this type of viewing experience... Today, I still look forward to a movie that will top this one, and I know, that if that happens... it will be an incredible day."

With such pure heart and spirit, it'd be over-spoiled and soulless to not at least admire this epic, and for those who care for such wonder in movies, can see and embrace this galactic voyage and forever be connected and entranced by its power. Nolan, we thank you. (8.9/10)"

",2018-01-19 00:00:00,9,"Note At first you should know that this may take some of your time, depending on your reading speed combined with Einstein's theory of relativity, which may be ten minutes or ten hours. I felt the need to say that sarcastic side, and I say that the topic will address comprehensively to all dimensions of the film and beyond, so the talk may be long .. So if you are not interested in cinema in general or this film in particular may get bored and I advise you to save time for something else.A dream of a better future, an eternal human dream on which all empires, states and governments enslaved their peoples, an endless human conflict that led to the waste of natural resources on a land we would never have owned, the ruin of a human solution through the century and the time until the end. The earth is home to all the creatures before us to be our home, our selfishness wasted us every time, and the film begins to face the consequences of our arrogance, greed and murder to each other.From the beginning and on several points, we will talk about the film, the scientific aspect and then the noise it caused whether it is due or not and the reasons for it .. You may not find the arrangement necessarily as mentioned .. But we will ensure you an enjoyable reading.Christopher Nolan is one of the most horrifying and powerful in the history of mankind since its inception. Bingmie or Interstellar is a film that talks about the remoteness of the planet, and what humanity has to do with innovations and theories, then applied industries, to raise the human race and its wings apart from beyond the stars. , Where Matthew says ""mankind was born on earth ... it was not supposed to die in it.""Sci-fi starring Matthew McConnee, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Shastain, Ellen Burstein and Michael Kane. The subject of a team of astronauts traveling through the hole Dudi in an attempt to search for another planet is good for life other than the land that is dying."
" The best science-fiction drama I've seen since Kubrick's 2001
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,10,"It has been a while since I watched this movie for the first time. I have rewatched it several times ever since, just yesterday actually. That motivated me to finally write a review. Interstellar is sort of a hybrid-movie. It's not fully drama, but not fully sci-fi either. It's pretty much a perfect mixture as in Chris Nolan absolutely masters the addition of a very personal and human element in the story. 
The movie starts out like a drama. We get introduced to a broken man (Cooper) with his kids and his farm. Step by step, we realize that this family is living on a pre-apocalyptic earth which runs out of food for the people who inhabit it. 
The real science-fiction comes in later, after the theme of the Father-Daughter-relationship is properly established. That way, we experience the entire movie with all its epicness with this deeply personal aspect in the back of our minds. Especially the first half of the movie is tremendously strong and evoked emotions for me that I never thought I could feel in the science fiction genre. Also, a Christopher Nolan movie wouldn't be a Christopher Nolan movie if it didn't incorporate a mind-bending element in some way. In Interstellar's case, it is a wormhole. A wormhole and the question who put it there. The plot keeps a decent amount of complexity throughout the majority of the picture. In more laid-back moments during watching it, there was always this question of 'what's all this for? Why did things happen like they did?'. It kept me interested until the end, when I got presented an answer that was complicated, yet satisfying. Another ingenius part of the movie is just ho well put-together it is. The scenery on earth with the farm, the corn and the dust is so authentic, so real and only adds to the credibility of the characters' situation. Then of course, there's the insane vastness, endlessness of the universe which Nolan and Hoyte van Hoytema, the director of photography, display oh so perfectly. On top, every scene beholds so many details, things other directors wouldn't mind during the production of a movie of that scale. All the visual goodies combined with Hans Zimmer's music - which is truly outstanding, some of his best work here - Interstellar makes a sci-fi epic that, through the proximity and personality that's created, is truly one-of-a-kind. Every element works exactly as it should, and as soon as one fully understood that plot, it becomes so rewatchable, despite a runtime of just short of three hours. Interstellar as a whole isn't comparable to sci-fi blockbusters such as Star Trek, Star Wars or Blade Runner. And yet, it still remains a blockbuster just as much as it is a drama. I would say the only movie in that genre (and there aren't many of them in the first place) and competes - or even exceeds - Interstellar is Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A space odyssey.If you go into Interstellar with a bit of patience and will to think a little while watching, you'll be treated with one of the most visually appealing sci-fi dramas ever."
" If not for the length . . . .
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,6,"I actually enjoyed this movie. More on that, and why later.
Why, oh why, do we need to have movies last over 2 hours?
Seriously? No really SERIOUSLY?
What does an extra 49 minutes convey to an audience that 2 hours could not with careful editing.
I think it's a ploy, to buy more $10 popcorn and $5 beverages, oh and to miss part of the film while you visit the bathroom without a pause button at your disposal. Only to want to rent the movie on DVD or otherwise see it again. I don't know anyone that cannot visit the bathroom at least once in almost three hours, but then again I am in the older demographics here.Anyway, the movie was done well, actors did their jobs and I had to piss before half way through the thing. Just me you say? I think not.Hollywood, get your heads out of your buttocks and limit films to under two hours.
My ONLY exception to this rule to date is Braveheart. Great movie, still too long.
Hollywood you listening?"

" A good sci-fi drama, but needed more action and adventure!
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'Interstellar' was a film I'd been waiting to see all year, and it certainly is a huge sci-fi film - $165 million budget - from one of the best filmmakers going round. Basically, we spend 40min on Earth in the not-too-distant-future, where all the crops are failing and Homo sapiens are about to be wiped from the planet. Cooper (McConaughey), Romilly (Gyasi) & Dr Brand (Hathaway) are then sent to another galaxy - via a wormhole - as a last grasp attempt to find another habitable planet.The film does really well of asking those big picture themes - what's more important, family of the entire species, love or exploration, why do we matter? However, as a sci-fi/action film, it sometimes lets itself down - the characters aren't that well developed, beside Cooper & his two kids (Chastain & Affleck when they're older) and there's too much maths/physics/relativity and not enough excitement and wonder.Sure, the special effects you do get to see of the black hole and the planets they visit are great, but there's just not enough of them - it's a lot of them in a space suit/ship with an overbearing Hans Zimmer's score making it hard to hear actual dialogue. It's probably slightly longer than necessary also - 2 hours 50min, with the last 30min being a less-than-ideal conclusion to the film. Hopefully Damon playing an astronaut prepares him for next year's 'The Martian', which should be more exciting than 'Interstellar'.Nolan - who will arguably one day go down as a directorial legend like Kubrick - owes a lot to '2001: A Space Odyssey' and essentially 'Interstellar' doesn't do anything better than that film 46 years ago. But it's not all bad - I think my expectations were too high, especially after 'Gravity' last year - with Caine & Lithgow being solid on Earth and the robots, TARS & CASE (very similar voices/roles to HAL in '2001' & GERTY in 'Moon') providing some humour (and a very unique form/function!)."
" from the audio to the video...

" Another Christopher Nolan masterpiece
",2017-12-30 00:00:00,10,"I'll say a number of things about Interstellar but basically ... words fail me. This is one h*** of a movie. Even though it has some flaws, or at least certain things that bother me a bit, I find this film so absorbing from start to finish that I just can't resist giving it 10/10. Big-screen, big ideas, big-budget, terrific technology, a script that's not dumbed down, and a stacked cast. And the run time of almost 3 hours has not a single wasted minute -- it's not at all too long for its seamlessly interlocked plot to unfold. Everything is here -- gut-wrenching personal tragedies and triumphs, visual spectacle like nothing before, high drama, inspirational striving against huge odds, and all delivered by actors in total command. If you don't read any further, I hope this is already enough to persuade you to see it (or see it again!).TIFF was playing both Interstellar and 2001: A Space Odyssey this past month so I went in to see it in their beautiful theater space again, three years after its first release. The pro critics would see 2001 (from 1968) as its logical predecessor, and to some extent it certainly is. But it also owes a lot to 2010: The Year We Make Contact (from 1984) in its pure and accurate depiction of space travel. (As one example, take the sequence in Interstellar showing their arrival at Saturn, and compare it with 2010's arrival at Jupiter and the atmospheric braking technique. Both are visually magnificent.) But there are things in Interstellar that are entirely its own, such as the scenes of the black hole with accretion disk, its NON-singular center (a nonrotating black hole has a singular point of infinite density at its center, but a spinning black hole actually does not!), the stretching of time in a strong gravitational field, and the outside view of the wormhole with its gravitationally lensed images of galaxies on the far side. During the production it became well known that Nolan was (intelligently) relying on consultation with Kip Thorne, a theoretical astrophysicist and specialist in gravity and spacetime, and it showed. Maybe Thorne didn't get an Oscar for this work, but I'm sure he'll make do with his Nobel Prize. :) There's so much here that is done right, all the way down to the simple fact that the views outside the various spacecraft are utterly silent no matter if their thrusters are firing or they are colliding -- sound doesn't exist in a vacuum, period. The cast list is just amazing: Matthew McConaughey, Jessica Chastain, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon, John Lithgow, Wes Bentley, David Gyasi, and a wonderful Mackenzie Foy as 10-year-old ""Murph"" (under certain camera angles and lighting, she and Chastain as her older self look uncannily alike). Every one of them has an essential role to play in this rich and complex script. Also worth noting: thankfully it's becoming common enough now for a woman scientist to play a major role in SF and other films, but it's still very rare to have MORE than one. Here we've got both Hathaway (biologist) and Chastain (physicist), and their characters are both key players and heroes in their own right. And the advanced-AI robots on the spacecraft are predictably charming, but thankfully do NOT steal the show. This is an ensemble cast all the way through.Hans Zimmer's musical score is quite distinctive, even for him. I particularly liked the elegant dance-like motif that accompanies spacecraft travel scenes among others -- it's a gently soaring, yearning line of song that just ... never... quite ... resolves or comes to rest. On the other hand, he has a couple of suitably massive themes for the big dramatic buildups that pack a real punch.OK, for the things that bothered me a bit:the 'tesseract library' at the center of the black hole and the transmission of signals across time by manipulating gravity: I know it's ingenious, but it is just a bit hard to swallow. I keep wondering if there was a better way to do this, but I'll admit I can't think of one.the ships would have been ripped apart going into the black hole; the tidal field around a stellar-mass b.h. is too steep for anything solid to maintain its structure.with Earth's resources dwindling and monoculture crops catastrophically failing one after the other, how come everyone still drives cars and trucks everywhere? Where is the gas coming from?These are quibbles though. The powerful storyline and first rate production quality trump everything else. A modern classic."
" Even better the 2nd time
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,8,"I barely remember watching this when it came out and at the time found little to no interest in the movie. Thanks to the power of YouTube, I began to watch clips of the movie (primarily the black hole scene) and was sucked into wanting to see the movie again. After seeing it again (and again) I've really come to like this movie for many reasons. The musical score is outstanding, intense and heartfelt. It really takes you on a journey through space and time all by itself. The movie however is much more than that. You wonder at the end if it was the science or the love that saw the mission through and brought Cooper back home (eventually). The detail and through of the script was on par to make Interstellar a great sci-fi movie with no goofy over CGI effects or aliens to ruin the scenes. I am not hugely fond of McConaughey but I found him to fit this role perfectly as did I with all the other actors/actresses in this futuristic film. I really would recommend this movie to anyone as it feels that you yourself are part of the journey and excitement and not just watching it on the screen."
" Interstellar - The best of cinema
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,10,"Christopher Nolan is, without a doubt, one of the best directors working today. His films are almost perfect, but there are clearly ups and downs in his filmography. But the essential issue that promotes him as an artist is his almost extreme dedication to a notion of creativity and respect for the audience. He does not just want to tell a story about the world of mixed dreams, he wants us to be emotionally invested so that we finally understand that the essential core in any movie will always fall back on the emotional aspect, or rather, on our ability to re- positively or negatively) on the characters that fill the screen.
The film of this master of the 21st Century is called ""Interstellar"" and I say that it is a risky film and that, in general, it succeeds in its difficult task.
It is undoubtedly one of the films of that year, the making and photography are particularly studied in this film when absolutely everything, from the first minute, seems realistic and without CGI (Computer Graphic Imagery). The soundtrack is, at this time, a seal of Nolan in all its films and this one does not disappoint in anything, accompanies the film as if of an opera it was, with the crescendos to be intense and sweeping and the scenes more tense to leave someone breathless due to subtle touches. Interpretations are, as a general rule, very good. Regarding the story, it is difficult to go into detail without revealing much of the narrative so I will conclude by saying that this is one of the best films of that year.
However Nolan revealing that thematically has no limits and that his vision is more a gift for those who love cinema intensely."
" Brilliant,from story to image
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,10,"If you like astronomy it's a very good movie,it really makes you think about life and space even hours after watching it.The father-child love completes the movie so that it's not just a 3 hours long space documentary."
" Ultrastellar
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,10,"Ten stars doesn't mean that it the greatest movie ever, it just means that it met my expectations. The problem with most American movie watchers is that their taste and knowledge on movies centers around movies like Troll 2. For a movie to provide a thinking plot or to be challenging is too painful for the average movie watcher. Yes, you can be entertained and challenged at the same time and not end up in a Wormhole. Interstellar does a fantastic job making you think of the complexity of life, space, and things unknown. Yes, it has its flaws just like many other movies but what it lacks in flaws is nicely balanced by a thoughtful, challenging and inspirational ifs!"
" Really long...and really good
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,8,"This film was silly, long, overwrought and pretty far-fetched. But Nolan keeps you in it, emotionally and intellectually. He's a master storyteller even when the story itself fails at points. I could have done without the last 1/3, but the first 2/3 left me intrigued and breathless...just like he likes it. At one point a character demonstrates the time space dimension with a folded piece of paper; Nolan's films are just that: pages of a story folded over and over. You will love the characters, the pathos and the journey even when the point feels a bit - well - pointless. Plus, hard to fault a Science Fiction film for going all religious/philosophical. It's happened before and will happen again."
" Where real men cried!
",2017-12-25 00:00:00,10,"This is the movie that makes real men cry! So much truth regarding the human condition, the pain of everyday, the reaching out for more, the desire of answers and breaking barriers of our own mental unknown. Is this it, or is there more?"
" Legend Movie!

",2017-12-16 00:00:00,4,"Very interesting scientific wise but adding the little girl ruined it for me . . . not necessary . . . and pretty much ruined the film for me. I watch movies to be entertained, not negatively affected by them. Leaving your child is a traumatic experience. I understand in Hollywood leaving your child behind is just a simple inconvenience for most entertainers but in this film this was a terrible situation that made me dislike this film. . . . Hollywood is truly out of touch with humankind . . ."
" An epical science fiction movie!!!!
",2017-12-15 00:00:00,10,"I do not like the sci-fi movie, because they are so too much. But this movie, Interstellar, it's the exception! The way of presenting the relativity of time combined with the emotions of the main actors is incredible, because humans can not realize the time beyond the earth and this is is leading them to insanity."
" What e=mc2 Is In Nolanisms
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,10,"If this is not in your Top 100 favorite movies of all time, you should hang your head in shame.Every Christopher Nolan movie I've seen so far has made that list. So could be the case with you. Certainly, there are plenty of 'Nolanisms' (idiosyncrasies Director Christopher Nolan adds to most of his movies that few understand absolutely) but that's what I personally like about Nolan's movies. They make you pay attention, think differently, and be introspective. Interstellar is nearly 3- hours (!) of non-stop story telling, and nearly non-stop-Nolanisms, with twists and complicated theories about time travel and relativity and scientific mumbo- jumbo. It's told so well I actually I believe it! In fact, if Nolan were a doomsayer building a spaceship to take me to another planet when the world ends (ie Trump's reelection) I'd sign over my bank accounts and wife right now (ok, maybe not my bank accounts). That's how convincing Interstellar is.Even if none of the theory told here is ever proved, Nolan sure makes a good case for interstellar travel. But I digress. This isn't 'just' a movie for science geeks. I'm sort of a geek, but I'm an idiot and much of the 4th, and now apparently 5th dimension gobbledy gook is way over my inflated head (I still need a calculator for simple equations). But, there is also great story about love and sacrifice and family. On one hand, not having a family myself, I can understand the yearning for wanting to go away and explore space for 50+ Earth years. However, I can also understand the basic need for human interaction and the unconditional love and forgiveness one's family can bring. Having to choose between one or the other is not easy and that's exactly what McConaughey's character must do (although he seems to choose which with very little indecisiveness).There's so much more to this complex movie it's one you may need (want) to see more than once to 'get'. It's in my Top 25 so viewing it again and again is not going to be foreign to me."
" Brilliant movie
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,9,"One of the best movies to release in the last 3 years. The great storyline and visual effects makes this a must-watch. I actually think the second time you watch it, you will see things you might have missed the first time. At least for me, the second time around, I appreciated the story better.Matthew McConaughey is brilliant in the movie. Of course, Christopher Nolan works his magic and the end result is a stunning movie that will make you want to watch it again :)"
" Interstellar film review
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,10,"I have never been a fan of Sci-Fi films, I haven't watched Star Trek or Star Wars, but Interstellar, which was directed by Christopher Nolan, took me by surprise.Interstellar's plot is really interesting. It's not a usual Sci-Fi plot. It's far more complicated, serious and interesting than other science-fiction films are. It tells a story about a team of explorers going for an Interstellar travel in order to ensure humanity's survival because food on earth is about to end.This film shines the most with its gripping story. Acting is also very professional and in my opinion, the protagonist (Matthew McConaughey) did really good. At some points, the acting was so real that it was really heartbreaking. Also, nowadays a Sci-Fi film can't be created without special effects and they were realistic and professional in Interstellar. Music also found a right place in the film, right at the start.Overall Interstellar has been the best Sci-Fi film I have ever seen in my life and probably will also stay one. I recommend this film to everyone, who can watch 160 minutes long film without problems."
" Hard to understand dialogue
",2017-11-27 00:00:00,2,"(NB I'm watching the movie on TV from a DVD, with computer type speakers, not a home entertainment sound system)Another movie, where actors (mostly male) mumble and whisper, making the dialogue hard to follow. It's like they have lowered their voices too, and are speaking in a way that isn't ""normal"".If I turn up the volume, I'll eventually get an explosion of loud sound effects. So not conducive to watching at night, when others are sleeping.As a consequence of having difficulty understanding what the actors are saying (especially Matthew McConaughey), I found the movie dull and boring. And I'd probably add that it's too long."
" Self indulgent twaddle
",2017-11-27 00:00:00,1,"I've actually tried to watch this twice, once in the cinema (I walked out, something I've never done before in a film) and once at home on video. Both times I failed to complete the mission.Please don't compare this stinking mess with Kubrick's epic ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"", it is not in the same league or even in the same universe! With horrible acting and mumbling by Mr. McConaughey, incomprehensible jargon and pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo overlaid with Zimmer's monstrously horrendous score I will not try watching it a third time."
" best space movie ever
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,10,"This has been the best space movie I have EVER seen. The biggest complaint I get from people is that they ""don't get it"" after watching it once. Well, I says, watch it again! The music is amazing. I am in a master's program for film in music (at the moment) and I feel like this is the most popular movie students like to write a paper on right now, meaning it is all the rave. I have amazing (sorry for the lack in modesty) focus and understanding of movie story lines and plots so I was able to watch this the first time & I was like OMG OMG OMG this movie is AMAZING!!! The plot and writing is PURE GENIUS. It will blow your mind. It's almost like I feel as though I am in a higher awareness or consciousness after watching this movie. OK, need to calm down but seriously fantastic movie. So far, definitely my favorite space movie of all time."
" Won't find any better
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,10,"Matthew McConaughey is one of the best actors out there, who brought a lot to the acting in this movie.Every aspect was just top notch. Definitely gonna re-watch it in the future. The fact that this could be real someday just absolutely blows my mind. Absolutely astonishing.Truly a masterpiece, would 100% recommend."
" a genius incredible very beautiful movie The end of the earth is not our end
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,9,"I can say frankly that i am one of the most fanatical fanatics of the genius Christopher Nolan , what i can i sad , that is incredible science fiction movie , Nolan teach us physique their , the story was great very nice ..., acting waw it was perfect without mistakes finally that experience was funny beautiful important to me and every cinema fans in the world any one if you love movie u have to watch it first second third never mind you will never regret i am so sure body
Note 2: At first you should know that this may take some of your time, depending on your reading speed coupled with Einstein's theory of relativity, it may be ten minutes or ten hours. I felt the need to say that sarcastic side, and I say that the topic will address comprehensively to all dimensions of the film and beyond, so the talk may be long .. So if you are not interested in cinema in general or this film in particular may get bored and I advise you to save time for something else.A dream of a better future, an eternal human dream on which all empires, states and governments enslaved their peoples, an endless human conflict that led to the waste of natural resources on a land we would never have owned, the ruin of a human solution through the century and the time until the end. The earth is home to all the creatures before us to be our home, our selfishness wasted us every time, and the film begins to face the consequences of our arrogance, greed and murder to each other.From the beginning and on several points, we will talk about the film, the scientific aspect and then the noise it caused whether it is due or not and the reasons for it .. You may not find the arrangement necessarily as mentioned .. But we will ensure you an enjoyable reading.Christopher Nolan is one of the most horrifying and powerful in the history of mankind since its inception. Bingmie or Interstellar is a film that talks about the remoteness of the planet, and what humanity has to do with innovations and theories, then applied industries, to raise the human race and its wings apart from beyond the stars. , Where Matthew says ""mankind was born on earth ... it was not supposed to die in it.""Sci-fi starring Matthew McConnee, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Shastain, Ellen Burstein and Michael Kane. The subject of a team of astronauts traveling through the hole Dudi in an attempt to search for another planet is good for life other than the land that is dying.

" Mind blowing
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,10,You feel emotional about this movie that's the first thing the first reason makes this movie great this besides another reasons this movie has the best mind-blowing ending and bending in all the time this movie show you how the directors could use his all abilities and all elements he have to give you a great work
" I found no word to describe this
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,9,"First of all when it comes the name of Christopher Nolan, I find it nearly impossible to say or comment or write anything about him. Same goes with this film. This is a movie that will just blow your mind. You would just feel numb after watching this. You would keep asking yourself, what I have just watched? Is that from this planet earth or from somewhere else?"
" A bold, emotional and intellectual sci-fi epic
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,9,"Good:Amazing direction, cinematography, acting and soundtrack. Well written original story filled with emotionally relatable characters and scientific accuracies. Grand, incredible visuals and imagery of space that evoke the senses and emotions of viewers. Bad:A few draggy expositions in the first half of the movie."
" Watched until the End
",2017-11-10 00:00:00,4,"With a great deal of effort I managed to watch this movie in its entirety. That was because the storyline was peculiar enough for me to say - I need to see how the film is going to (hopefully) tie-together. Thus that positive brought my rating up to a 4. On the negative-side:1) this movie is 2.5 hr of tedious lack-of-action. 2) most dialogue is mumbled - sounding like a new foreign language, or low in volume. 3) Those dialogue issues thus made it near impossible to follow the complex plot ""reveals"". 4) The special effects were not 2014-quality. The spaceship shots reminded me of circa-1980's Battlestar Galactica. 5) Plot problem: the pilot (MM) is enlisted to fly the spaceship because he was a great pilot many years ago. The next thing you know he's at the controls of a very complex spaceship that he has never seen. I guess if the writer suggested that the pilot went thru months of training', would have just dulled this movie further. It would be like Rocky fighting Apollo Creed, without showing the side-of-beef being hit, and running the City Hall steps.Anyway this is not a great movie in any sense. A story that tries to play on the themes of : 1) Love overcomes all, and 2) a father's love for his family can overcome the physics of the universe, are just predictable emotional-appeals (of the writer/producer) - trying to salvage something at the box-office, from the audience being left with a ""feel-good"".A great story + being well executed + an emotional-appeal = an 8 to 10 rating. This movie is just a lifeless, jumbled bore."
" The movie has stayed very close to the story, with minimal efforts to showcase the marvels of space with visual effects
",2017-11-06 00:00:00,9,"There are movies, which suck you in to their world and leave you mesmerized (like Inception) and then there are movies which leave a higher impression, one of awe and inspiration while passing a message which could define human capability and in ways, humanity itself. Interstellar, in my view Nolan's attempt at not only creating pioneer cinema, but also communicating to the human urge to get out of our comfort zones n go explore the unknown. In a scene, Mr. Copper (protagonist) shares a trivia with his fellow traveler about many long range yatch drivers not knowing how to swim.The movie has stayed very close to the story, with minimal efforts to showcase the marvels of space with visual effects (things other Hollywood summer blockbusters can learn from). Some audience may even get a feel of movie being low on budget, at $165mn it's huge enough and patience pays in the second half.Moving on to story line (without spoilers), is simply about a father keeping his promise to daughter in the backdrop of Earth suffering from famine and an interstellar expedition to find a potential solution. Performance wise, Mathew is brilliant as the adventurer, explorer, father, son, guide and de facto captain. Sir Caine charms as always, Anne tries and Matt Damon surprises (kept aloof in trailers). Cake however goes to Mackenzie Foy for honest (90%) portrayal of Young Murphy. Both TARS (70% humour) and CASE (100% efficient) are superbly cast too, potential competition for R2D2..Verdict - Am not eligible to judge such cinema, but I'd recommend you watch it once (if possible in IMAX screen), and wonder whether it's you or the seat which is shaking...Oh, and FYI In physics, three dimensions of space and one of time is the accepted norm. Thank me later ;)"
" Terrible soundtrack
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,1,Worst sound ever... music so loud you have trouble hearing the spoken words. Fix it or dump it. The plot would be interesting if it could be heard. The acting is well done if they could be heard. Turn down the music and turn up the voice. I will never understand the choice to keep the music and sounds louder than the words. Total frustrating.
" Completely amazed
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,10,"I have to admit that the first time I saw this movie, was not completely engaged. I felt that in some how the last part was forced to conclude the film in a very different way the film was being directed. I thought that the immersive, technically accurate and emotional first part didn't correspond to the final acts. But after seeing this a few more times, I think the end is precisely what Nolan wanted for his film. It is emotionally driven and sometimes not everything can be explained with physics. This is a masterpiece and for me the scene where Matt Damon tries to dock in the Endurance is the best action scene I've seen in many years. Acting is really good, specially McConaughey, Hathaway and Caine, bringing into life some memorable characters. However there are some minor flaws, no one can compare to the strengths of this movie. I recommend you to search for videos explaining how Nolan and his team draw for the first time a black hole using the physics law, or how they filmed the first planet full of water. Those kind of attention to detail will give you an idea when a Director is really loving what he does. Just sit and enjoy the ride."
" One of the best movie ever made
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,10,"A truly masterpiece. Visually outstanding, great acting especially from Matthew McConaughey! Hans Zimmer composed probably the best Soundtrack ever for a film. Not to mention the great writing and incredible storytelling from the Nolan brothers. It is very suspenseful, creative, exciting, astonishing, and emotional."
" Best space movie
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,10,"I can bravely say that this is best space movies that's produced,and the music by Hans Zimmer proves why he is the best,the length of the film is 2 hr 48 minutes but never feels slow. personally my favorite movie of Christoper Nolan is Interstellar In this film there is a scene on docking ,its one of the best scenes and Hans Zimmer's music in that is just awesome to the core"
" Many 1 Star Reviewers Didn't Get It
",2017-10-31 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie when it came out and recently returned to it after watching Passengers (a pretty good movie).I wanted to respond to some of the 1 star reviews. Many of them say the science is wrong, but they probably don't understand the science. Most of the fantastical stuff this movie is based on current theories (e.g. that worm holes would appear as a sphere). These theories may or may not end up being correct, or feasible as used in this movie, but it's based on ideas from a brilliant theoretical physicist.It's a deep, complex movie, and I got lost a couple times during my initial viewing. e.g. when Cooper went into the tesseract I thought it was too strange at the time (and it broke the suspension of disbelief), but later realized what was supposed to be happening. So perhaps things could have been made a little clearer for the audience so it was easier to follow. And there's a few other things that keep it from being perfect. But it's incredibly ambitious and the atmosphere was really great."
" Ambitious, Powerful and Inspiring.
",2017-10-30 00:00:00,10,"A movie so ambitious and foresightful, it leaves the viewer wondering about the inevitable future of the human race while also inspiring some to take a deep interest in physics. I recommend everyone to watch the movie because you will all leave with something to take away from the film."
" One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,10,"Do not skip this movie. It is on of the best I have seen in a long time. I am not a word-smith and cannot do this film justice by trying to describe why you need to watch it. Just know, if you have not seen this movie yet, stop reading reviews and start watching!!! This film made me laugh, and cry. As a father I can imagine what Mathew M. is going through, the joy the pain, the need to protect those you love. This film will appeal to most. From us Science Fiction geeks, to people who want a great drama. We can all sit down and appreciate this film. Now stop reading and go watch already!"
" Canonical Cinema
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,9,"When you watch Interstellar you are reminded of why cinema exists. The sheer ingenuity of this movie inspires us to dream of possibilities beyond our current horizons. This is a story of the formidable human spirit and how it is destined to be tested across the vast stretches of space and time. It is a story which deserved the grandeur and finesse it received from Mr. Nolan and his team in every department. If you appreciate movies with heart and character, you will not be disappointed and If you like sci-fi, my guess is you would be waiting to read this review to watch it. Chances are, you already love it. Two thumbs up!"
" A piece of art.
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,10,"I am shocked of how amazing the movie is. I literally have no words. I don't even want to talk about the small issues, since the story line tops all of them. A great combination between the real and unreal. Between the possible and the impossible. Between the things we know and the things we don't know. A great acting and great feelings for a dad. No much words to say, i advice everyone over 18 to watch this movie."
" Amazing!!!
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,10,"A grand yet close to home space opera which stands as my favorite film of all time. Every aspect to which makes a film enjoyable for me is met. Sci fi. check. Killer soundtrack.check. science fact theories. check. killer quotes check. imaginative themes. check. what if factor. check. dark themes. check. educational. check. imax compatible. check. challenges viewers. check. Nolan brings to life one of the best sci fi movies ever. It starts a great conversation and left me sad. the suggestive elements and theories implemented changed my outlook on space exploration, time, and environmental issues. He made space into a big scary untamable beast with obstacles such as time and gravity. A lot can be taken from this film making it an all time classic/must see. thanks for delivering Nolan. I cant wait to see what he does next. Inception used to be my #1 all time favorite until he decided to tickle my astronomy fascination even the title makes it my cup of tea. Favorite scene is the first water planet they land on. Truly horrific and begins the conflict."
" crap
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,3,"so so so so boring. first of all, its 3 hours long!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no need for it to be THAT LONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and most of it is them talking. when it does get to the good part, which is only one part of the movie, that's it, one part that was remotely interesting. i even skip'ed 30 mins at the start (because it was way to long) and i never missed a thing, i pretty much just missed the story time about the dad and the daughter. i usually say with not so great flicks, give it a watch if you have nothing better to watch, like i done when watching this movie.. but its not even worth watching when bored!! if you're hardcore into sci fi, aliens, mars, and astronauts, then you might like it. i liked the martian way better than this."
" A Complete Disappointment
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,6,"2001 is my all time favorite movie Blade Runner is one of my all time favourites too I pretty much loved all Nolan's movies except for the Dark Knight Rises So, theoretically this should have been a great time and great movie... it wasn't The story, the science, the pace where all wrong in so many ways. I even gave the movie a second chance at home, but things just didn't improve I just can't believe this has such a high rating, it just doesn't deserve it"
" Interstellar Will Give You 15 Minutes of Speechless Moment When It Ends
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,8,"Recently highly anticipated Pakistani movie ""021"" starring Shaan Shahid received Boos and Hoots in Capri Cinema in Karachi. 021 which was being tipped as brainiest Pakistani movie ever by critics has not been well received by audience of single screen cinemas. Negative response from such an audience must not be assumed as final verdict because there is large section of society which praised this movie overwhelmingly and critics loved it. Same goes with Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"".Mr. Nolan's space adventure will confront same fate if it is released on same single screen cinema in Karachi. We will not be entirely wrong if we claim that Interstellar is for Nerds but not for Jerks. Since Mr. Nolan's romance with Batman franchise has ended he has been creating plots which have been difficult to decipher. First Inception and now with Interstellar Mr. Nolan has proved himself as a director who always intends to tingle with audience intelligence and consciousness through his unique ideas and does not have slightest fear of negative response from audience.Interstellar starts with a future world facing increasing level of nitrogen in earthly atmosphere and depleting level of oxygen causing catastrophic outcome. Crops have died and farmers are not able to produce anything except corn. Fertile grounds are converting into desert and massive sand storms have become daily routine. There are no armies in the world and US Government has shut down all unproductive endeavors such as NASA to save scarcely available resources. In this grim time NASA drop out engineer and currently corn farmer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) finds unknown gravitational anomaly which leads him to discover NASA working underground for years to save last of humanity.NASA's chief Professor Brand (Michael Caine) along with his daughter Amelia (Anne Hathaway) reveals him that NASA has discovered some sort of Traversable wormhole in our solar system near planet Saturn. Professor Brand convinces Cooper to lead a team of explorers to surpass the limitation on human space travel to discover inhabitable planet in other galaxy for humanity by using interstellar voyage through newly discovered wormhole. Cinematic presentation of concept of intergalactic traveling is not new for moviegoers but Interstellar gives us a slight nose dip with touch of reality. Interstellar looks like that Mr. Nolan has wrapped Paul Anderson's 1997 ""Even Horizon"" into Stanley Kubrick's ""Space Odyssey"" but with lots of emotions involved in. In one of scenes in which one of Interstellar voyager explains how Traversable wormhole works has an enormous similarity to one scene of ""Event Horizon"".As we know that Mr. Nolan is master of creating climax in almost every scene, Interstellar gives its viewers brainstorming sessions from beginning to end. As I have mentioned above this new Nolan's saga is a treat for Nerds and if you are not aware of the concepts such as Murphy's Law, Theory of Relativity, Traversable Wormhole, Black Hole and singularity then Interstellar is nothing but waste of 169 minutes of your life. Interstellar invokes many questions with subjective layering such as assuming love as the fifth dimension of the time and interstellar voyagers are shown discussing about ""They"" who presumably put this Wormhole up there in our solar system. This is the cleverness of Mr. Nolan who pops up many questions and expects viewers will draw conclusion according to their own set of beliefs. If you are Muslim believing in ascendancy of Prophet Mohammed (PBUH) to heaven on the eve of ""Isra and Mi'Raj"" then Interstellar will strengthen your belief in it. If you are just a Nerd and love Einstein's Theory of Relativity then Interstellar is a roller- coaster ride for you with an unexpectedly happy ending. If you are father then you will shed tears with believe that father's love for his daughter can transcend everything in the universe. Whatever reason you can carry to watch Christopher Nolan's space outing but one thing is certain it will give you 15 minutes of speechless moment when it ends."

",2017-10-13 00:00:00,10,"For me everything was amazing in this movie, as for the story line than for the soundtrack.Let's talk about that soundtrack, Hans zimmer give us one more time incredible music that got us agape and really get us into the movie like no one else can do.As for the story line I really find it accurate and realistic, and that is what I want in a movie, that we get real fact as if one day we would be able to do that, who knows!Anyway if you are wondering to try or not, I'm telling you to go for it and you won't be disappointed!"
" What a journey!
",2017-10-11 00:00:00,10,"The most beautiful space age movie I have ever seen, and one of the best ever made. You passionately understand and sympathize with the story from the very beginning! Matthew McConaughey brilliant performance makes sure that we as an audience follow his heart and mind, sometimes he doesn't even has to say anything and we know what he wants and where he is going. Brilliantly written as it makes us eager to know what happens next and it ends with a proper ending without needing a sequel! However, if they decide to make one even better, I will certainly watch it!This is what Hollywood should do more often!A must-see 10 out of 10 movie!"
" one of the best sci-fi movies ever released
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,10,"First I just want to say that this is one of my favorite movies! This amazing work by Christopher Nolan hardly has any down sides worth mentioning, like when the story begins to unfold, that point in the movie was hurried, and at the end looked like there was something for us to hope or wait for only there isn't because there's no sequel to the movie. But with all that said aside from these minor things, pretty much everything else was great. In my opinion the cast of the movie preformed very well in general, which I was expecting due to the presence of huge actors, the story of the movie was very good and well based, although it seemed a bit rushed in the beginning but that's a minor thing, the cgi was quite credible, it seemed almost real, the plot was very thrilling and adding the soundtrack that was flawless made for a movie that was purely just epic and fantastic!"
" Interstellar
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,10,"First of all Interstellar is a Sci-fi film and one of my personal favorites. In this film, Christopher Nolan (the Director) did a great job with the management and writing. Every aspect of the film is incredibly well done, the story is deep and has many twists that will surprise you, the soundtrack made by Hans Zimmer a famous composer is perfect. From the very beginning it gives you a sense of mystery that won't disappear until the end of the film. This movie has got spectacular special effects. The development of the characters is great, with a wonderful performance by Matthew McConaughey a famous actor who got 8 awards including an Oscar. Interstellar is a mind- blowing movie which is unique and special, you will never be disappointed to see it many times, and you will never forget it , a masterpiece !"
" A heavenly gift for dreamers
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,10,"Perhaps, the majority of us dreamed of space adventures when being children. Becoming an astronaut, an explorer of other worlds, whose life is extremely different from a common human being's lifestyle, comes across as something heroic. The movie Interstellar by Cristopher Nollan exploits precisely those dreams.Even though starting with the mundane Earth scenes of corn fields, wonderful space music hints the spectators that everything happens in the near future, at the same time giving a keen feeling of an imminent disaster. Events unfold frantically fast and in no time we finally peer to open space and fascinating pictures of the purest emptiness. Overall, the marvellous mix-up of splendid alien music and fabulous views creates magical and, simultaneously, absolutely real atmosphere. In addition, bright talented actors' play supplements the illusion of reality. You crave to believe everything you see. Much more, you are already gradually becoming an integral part of it. It is not only a brave team headed by the Matthew McConaughey's hero and wandering through blackness, it is you who is coming along. This feeling does not abandon the spectator for three long hours, which otherwise might have been a big disadvantage. Needless to say, time goes by too rapidly. Eventually, a sharp perception of an imminent end strikes harshly. You turn out to be sitting merely in the cinema, you are not a hero let alone a cosmonaut and you personally have not revealed the main mystery of the Universe.After all, there is a subtle impression left, which does not leave you for several days; maybe it can even stay with you for the rest of your life. This sensation is of the humankind having a particular mission and an invisible connection of the whole Universe with all of us. Definitely, the Nollan's genius gives us a rare superb gift that can help us divert ourselves from our mundane selfish tiny worlds to feel the greatness around us...and conceive of ourselves as little dreamers again."
" One of the films I will never forget as long as I don't have Alzheimer's
",2017-10-06 00:00:00,8,"Interstellar is the kind of film that people either absolutely love, or absolutely hate. I personally loved it and watched it twice in the Cinema. Other than it being visually beautiful. I'm always up for being taken out of my world, and zapped into a world of possibilities. At the end of the day, films are subjective. And if you don't like films based in space, and other dimensions, maybe you won't like this one."
" Best Scifi movie!May contain spoilers!
",2017-10-04 00:00:00,10,"Watched this movie few days ago and all i knew about movie is that will contain some space travel and that is about saving human race from extinction.Movie have few plots,some of really nice dosed action scenes just enough to keep you awake and to make sure that movie have your attention.In general story goes that our planet killing every crop,most of people work on farms to make sure there is enough food for population thats already dieing slowly.Then main character(Cooper) finds out that there is secret project of NASA whos main objective is to send people trough wormwhole to find next planet for humans.Don't want to go in details,but over time they started to check previous planets that were already checked with previous crews who was sent before.Slowly some things getting to make sense,plot becomes more interesting until the paddle is folded.But thats not even close whats going overall. What i didn't understand is when i watched movie i've checked ratings on IMDb and they was quite realistic with score 8+ What i didn't understand is how someone can give score of 1 to movie like this.I mean this is far more better than movies like Legion whos insulting your IQ.Even couple time scientist says in movie that this or that would be possible because we probably have four or five dimension which we cant be part of in our 3D world but there is no way that other life form can exist in a such multydimensional world.The fact is everything in this movie is based on real science and real scientists and astrophysicists(producers)who explained that there easily could be dimension where thought and matter can coexist.Im saying that because in last scenes in movie when Cooper come back from wormwhole hes stucked in new dimenzion where he can see our(room and his daughter)but hes in multydimensional dimension that is not stricted with time in place as ours. So all what this movie expects from you is to have some average IQ to understand story and so you can fully enjoy it.If you are not able to understand what i wrote then this movie is not for you and you should go and watch Legion or something(sarcastic). Hope you guys will watch this movie and enjoy it like i did and i cant wait to watch it again! :)"
" Thank you for not wasting my time Benevolant Universe
",2017-10-03 00:00:00,1,"51 Minutes into this movie and my internet connection got lost, so I just stopped watching it since I wasn't really watching it for the previous 20 minutes. It's just another boring Oscar-movie. Like so many other movies I have tried to watch before. I love movies and watch a few every week. Hardly any movie makes me want to look at car sharing apps on my phone. This one did. Usually I'm into the movie, just sit back, relax, leave my phone and watch the movie. I am not a scientist or care much for it. Some people told me that I really should watch this flick and tonight I made time for a 3-hour picture. All this time left of not watching Interstellar leaves me to write this passive-aggressive review. I thought, 'yeah, a father-daughter relationship gets highlighted next to space traveling'. Now where have I heard of that before...? (hint: it starts with A and stars Bruce Willis and Liv Tyler as the father and daughter). So that part of the plot isn't very original, but alright. What bothered me the most were two things: 1) the time line; switching from old people telling stories about devastation and then switching to the time those elderly were talking about without really making clear we're on different time frames here. Made me wonder if the time frame would later also become a problem. For now it didn't grip me into the movie. 2) this sounds really girlish and maybe even bogus to some, but it bothered me: Anne Hathaways hair-do! So while in the movie we get informed about the trip and the different timing on earth and beyond earth I kept thinking: ""what's her hair gonna look like, because that hair-do needs a trim every 4-6 weeks"". So I paid attention to other kinds of those details and to me that's what makes a great movie; realistic presentation of the actors getting older. This just wasn't good. Like I mentioned, only gonna mention those two things that bothered me the most. I don't write a lot of reviews, but I felt obliged to share my thoughts on this one. Save some of your precious time by watching the beginning and if it doesn't grip you within the first hour, just leave it be. There's so much other good stuff to watch! *peace*"
" for all those criticizing..
",2017-10-03 00:00:00,10,".. the Nolan Bros for the totally unreal and absurd physics they saw in Interstellar.. Ex: from one random user comment "" why not produce a script that obeys the laws of astrophysics, or at least some theories thereof?"" Well, their scientific consultant for this movie was Kip Thorne, who today won the Nobel prize for Physics! I'm not criticizing those who did not like movie, everyone has different opinions. But, come on, do not judge scientific contents if you do not know what you are talking about. Science laws are not subject to tastes or opinions or, better, they do but just if you are an actual scientists."
" overrated!
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,5,"it's an OK sci-fi movie, feels like an American nation pride overall. I was quite disappointed with the first time seeing it, it generated quite a buzz at first, but after i watched it like almost 75% finished, i felt very disappointed i couldn't find any amazing thing that was supposed to happened, these kind of things has been done before many-many years ago, i don't really get any element that's supposed to be very cool, or dramatic or spectacular or mind-blowing or revolutionary, we've seen these stuffs before.A truly mind-blowing similar movie that i would recommend everybody to watch is 2001: A space Odyssey by Stanley Kubrick it was released in 1968, and my God it was so ahead of it's time, not just the story but the attention to details, the rolling set,the suit/costume looks flawless it makes star wars costume materials look like a very cheap knock-off ""plasticky"" rubbish. So yeah, it is an okay movie, not mind-blowing. 5 out of 10, oh and i would also recommend Alien 1979. ;)"
" Excellent movie, but annoying soundtrack
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,7,"I would give the movie an 8, except for the sound track. While the music itself is good, it made some parts hard to hear the dialogue and other parts it was just irritating, enough that it made it hard to enjoy the move. Nolan says this was intentional, and I appreciate what he was trying to do. But I thought it detracted from the film's enjoyment."
" An absolute masterpiece
",2017-09-27 00:00:00,10,"This film is staggering in it's brilliance. Original, heart breaking, visually spectacular, well written, amazing plot. I honestly cannot think of anything bad about it. I regard this as one of the best sci-fi films if not the best of all time and I am a massive sci-fi fan! You must watch this film. If you don't then you are missing out on a piece of film history."
" Overrated. Total waste of idea.
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,3,"Although the idea is simple and written 100 times in SF novels and short stories, it could make a quite good space opera. It could be deep and wise. It could make people think. But no. It had to be wasted. The weakest point is not poor acting (by the way: McConaughey really can't speak? I am not the best in the world in English, but I know many native speakers who couldn't understand him talking), awful music. Even the dumbest possible design of a robot is not the worst part of the movie. It is a forced, painful solemness and pretended adherence to science and logic combined with funny, childish errors and a mile wide gaps in logic.It would take to much time and space to write down all stupid ideas, so just a few of them. Some of them are partially explained in the movie or e.g. in IMDb FAQ, but the explanations are even more naive than the goofs themselves. I start with a biggest problem: - In R. E. Raspe's ""Baron Munchausen"", the baron drowns in the mud and saves his life by pulling himself out, on his own hair. The Earthmen in the movie do the same: the humans from the future save their ancestors. But if the present people perish, there are no future people to save them... The most simple paradox, and yet they included it in the ""serious"" movie. And no naive explanations (branches, interpretations, non-linear timelines etc) can make it wiser, no matter how many times they use the word ""fractal"". And if the future people exist, they don't need to do anything, do they? - The best plan from the future humans is to put (in a past) a wormhole, 2 years flight from Earth, making it almost impossible to find and reach. Then the Earthmen would have to build spaceships for billions of people to travel to a new world. I would simply help the Earthmen get a decent crops...A catastrophic climate change destroys all the crops. How? During just several years? And all plants are dead? All animals? But humans survived? How? Isn't it possible e.g. to grow some algae in oceans? Why nobody even tries to do anything? - Why an anti-science education? A science never does any harm. Only the politics and businessmen do, using science. So it is not the science to be ostracized.A farmer drives his children to anti-science school fully equipped to bring a military drone down (has a specially programmed computer, antennas, means to establish a connection, etc.) - A ""ghost"" communication is very implausible. Does it really depend on gravity? Even some waves, oscillations would create observed effects on books/dust, the gravity hardly could.Barely legal NASA base, hidden in a barn, building a spaceship... Funny. Unsuccessfully looking for it's best pilot in the world, year after year... Funny. The pilot accidentally finds them, and is captured and interrogated like a war prisoner by scientists - funny. The scientists are pilot's old friends. And they just finished building a rocket. He has never seen this ship, he is a farmer for 20 years now, so will he fly it, the only hope for humanity, please? FUNNY! - Plan A and B. Science and technology so advanced that can keep human embryos alive during a space journey, and rise them to get humans, can not rise a radish on Earth (nor perform a MRI scan).Please, stop the stupid ""expert's presentation how it works"" (the imbecile with a pencil demonstrating wormholes, just like the similar imbecile in ""The Martian"" explaining the trivial maneuver around Earth). What makes it even more pathetic, the ""expert"" addresses his childish show to a engineer and best NASA pilot....and so on... I don't understand the physics that stands beside the unusual phenomena in the alien solar system, on its planets (the hundred miles high waves on an ocean two feet deep, the frozen, solid clouds in the air, the anti-logic movements of the ships, the anti-logic decisions of the crew... and so on...and at the end I (and all the nearby watchers) couldn't believe the stupidity of the falling to the black hole behind the main character daughter's bookshelves. It was... it was... unspoken. And the Future Men felt that the best way of communication with Present People is to shake the books in some girls' bedroom. If you can move the book, or a hand of the watch - that means, you can move objects - you can take a pen and write as well. It is the same action, using the same forces. Yes, I fully understand the meanings, metaphors, 11 dimensions of continuum, and so on. Doesn't help.To sum up: Interstellar is just another pseudoscience-fiction movie. It is intended to be deep and serious, but is just funny (including it's makers argumentation why it is not). It is not easy to think out a GOOD SF story. You can easily make a non-science fiction story which is very good and nice to read or watch (like Star Wars), but it cannot pretend it is serious and science-based. The most depressing thing about that movie is, however, it's huge overrating on IMDb. Are the young people so easy to control? If they see something that makes the first impression of having some value (slow, grave, pseudo-intellectual) they give 9 and 10 points just to show they are serious and deep-thinking? Is that why poor SF movies get such a high notes? Passengers, the last few Aliens and so on?My ""4"" rating is a real one, not lowered to balance the general overrating."
" Touching and just a absolute masterpiece.
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,10,"This film gave me so many feelings it was unreal. By far the best film I have seen. I have watched this film like 13 times and it still never stops impressing me. I really wish they make another film to explain what happens next, I think this is on everyones minds. The soundtrack is truly beautiful as well, I love to listen to it sometimes and it gives me hope and the means to explore. Nolan did a great job with this. 10/10 Every time I watch it."
" The best yet!
",2017-09-20 00:00:00,10,"I think Interstellar is the best film that shows a different point of view for how the life may turn in the future. All dough there are lots of films that may show an opinion, this is my favorite. why? Because is made on some foundations, things that are real and may become real in the close future.People are disappointed and those that have hope are separated themselves from the rest of the world. It's exactly how people are or may turn. Of course, there is something that maybe is too far stretched, but who does know exactly how we came to be on this earth?"
" When a famine is in the near future, a group of best-in-class doctors and pilots decide to act.
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,8,"This movie was great! I was sucked in to the movie the moment the word ""Interstellar"" faded in screen. I thought that some of the dialogue was a little too quiet; it was one of those movies where you have to adjust the volume throughout. Also, the wording in the dialogue could have been simplified. The rest of the movie I thought was great. This is one of Christopher Nolan's most successful movies. A unique film with a complex plot. Highly recommend."
" The Greatest Science Movie
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,10,Brilliant and one of the best (if not the best) Hollywood movies of all time. And personally my favorite. Great work by cast and the amazing Christopher Nolan. Not to forget the lovely soundtracks by Hans Zimmer. Amusing to watch. Some fiction and some real theoretical physics makes it perfect!
" Nice but little lame finishing movie plot touche.
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,8,"nice start. nice from start to mid-end.but lame final ending touche. of course you can add some imaginary feature in to the Science fiction. but hey, using black hole for all sort of magical wand? that is way too much push.also apart from that, I'd like to mention that final ending is sux and too plain. also lots of logic holes in plot were just discarded as movie starts to rush toward the end. but they did good study on kerbal station program.so in summary.Somewhat good SF stuff with some logic. bad ending and illogical magical black hole for using main story."
" so far so good
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,10,"this movie make me to feel so interested in universe things and think more about not only our planet ,to think about every single space of universe , and it really makes me to have a chicken skin very much time , is an exceptional movie that make me feel awesome every time i watch it , because this movie you can't watch just once , every time you watch it , it's like first time , congrats for everything."
" Ending spoils it
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,6,"I recently watched ""Interstellar"" for a second time, initially having forgotten that I'd already seen it. My wife and did a lot of ""gee this looks familiar"". She remembered more of it than I did (odd, because my memories of movies is usually much better) and as we talked about it more and got to recalling the ending I said, ""This is *that* movie? That was terrible!""I think I was so annoyed at the ending I'd blanked out having seen the movie at all.Second time through, I feel the same way about the ending. Terrible. ""Deus ex machina"". Ticked me off as much as the ending of ""Arrival"" did. And it's really a shame, because the rest of the movie was pretty well done. Nice world building, stunning visuals (if at times a bit too 2001- ish), pretty good acting, plot, pacing. I'd love to want to watch this again for all that. But I will never do that, I would not want to experience the ending again."
" Has potential but boring to watch
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,1,"Seemed like it has potential but the movie is 3hours long. It has scenes that are just unnecessary and the plot is not the best. I watched it about half way and got bored. It has no comedy, no moral realistic lesson behind it, and the scene setups are just bad.I'm rating it 1 because it is way too highly rated for other better movies that are under-rated."
" The movie which made me write my first review..
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,10,I just loved this movie.I know that some people think that this movie is dumb. But i have not yet heard someone point out particularly what is dumb in this movie. No one can say that what is shown in the movie cannot happen at all unless they have something to prove it by. It's that Every movie should get some breathing space to explore new ideas. Whenever something out of the box happens (or is said by anyone) it's assumed by people to be dumb. If everything will be realistic how will we come to know about new concepts and ideas. I connected with all the characters. It was Visually stunning (One of the best ever).THE SOUNDTRACK just awesome. I think this movie was great and Christopher Nolan did it again. Watch it you'll not regret it.
" Nolan taps into Zeitgeist
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,5,"Interstellar is both loved and hated among audiences. It interests me. How can the same film be both praised and derided so intensely? Is it a masterpiece with some obvious flaws, or is it a mediocre film that is propped up by fanboy-ism and bandwagon-ing? For starters, I would just like to say my opinion. I think the movie is fine. It's a little too drawn-out and has bizarre elements, and I think that the message of love is way out of place in such a film.Some people have pointed out glaring flaws in the story and characters, and for them, they are confused and angry that such a film could be considered one of the greatest of all time.So, how did Nolan do it? Well, I believe he tapped into Zeitgeist, or the 'spirit of the times.' He made a perfect storm of a movie, using elements that, on their own are not very special, but combined, they reflect the values of this age.Let's break it down. First off: space. The works of Neil deGrasse Tyson and Bill Nye have fired up new interest in space, and people loved the realistic take on the genre. Second: the message of love. Western Culture almost pivots now around the fulcrum of love, and hate crimes are now considered the most abominable atrocity one could commit.Layer on top of this the cinematography, direction, and style of Nolan, which fanboys have been eating up since Memento. And while I like almost all Nolan films, I think Interstellar is his worst, featuring Nolan-isms dialed up to 11, with philosophical stances on love, life, time, destiny, and humanity's position in the universe.Everyone has a right to like this film if they so choose, and there are reasons to like it. Just please, don't deny the fact that it's pretentious, overly long, and contrived. Recognize that but say that that didn't stop you from enjoying it."
" Disappointed
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,2,"Way too long, a bizarre story line made worse by a backing track that made me reach for the volume control very very often. Mute even, many many times. Whoever wrote the score, they tortured me for 2 hours plus. I stuck with it, endured it. The inter-dimensional library scenes verged on the ridiculous, and cylinder world at the end was right from Arthur C Clarke and way too small to be convincing."
" Best recent space sci-fi movie. Memorable
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,10,"The pace, the history, the characters, the music and the photography are perfectly matched to tell you a great adventure. You will feel it like you are involved in. I wont make spoilers but there is a moment when something ""magical"" happens that you don't see nowadays that made me feel like watching 2001 A Space Odyssey (which is a good thing)"
" Just A Masterpiece
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,10,I can't say anything. This movie made me want to rise its score. The music and the story blend so well. I can't find any other movie that good. I know this is short but is only to rise its score. the rest is nonsense: Much did had call new drew that kept. Limits expect wonder law she. Now has you views woman noisy match money rooms. To up remark it eldest length oh passed. Off because yet mistake feeling has men. Consulted disposing to moonlight ye extremity. Engage piqued in on coming.
" Best of what I've seen so far!
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,10,"I'm addicted to movies since I was 9 years old. I've watched so far more than 1.2K movies and this one is my favorite. the visual effects are amazing, the story is great and somewhat realistic. I love the actors everyone was really good and played their role perfectly. anyone over 15 will understand this movie it's not very complicated."
" Not great
",2017-08-18 00:00:00,6,"This film tries to treat the topic of interstellar travel seriously. Unfortunately, some ideas are presented according to our current knowledge of physics and astronomy, while others are just stupid. This mixture makes the suspension of disbelief, necessary to enjoy such movie, impossible to attain. On one side we have wormholes, black holes, higher dimensions of space and the silence of the void. On the other hand, there is totally unconvincing reality of the XXI century, where farmers are more valuable than engineers (guys, really?) and tomography is (mysteriously) gone. In one scene the physicist explains convincingly the work regime of the wormhole (by the way, this scene is IDENTICAL to the one from the far better Event Horizon). In another, we see the mission robot TARS, being the member of the crew. I know that humanoid machines from fifties seem ridiculous today (like the one from The Day The Earth Stood Still), but they are really the top quality idea compared to the robots depicted in Interstellar. It is difficult to believe someone created such a model and the whole crew agreed to put it the picture! It's almost like the the wooden planet from the initial script of Alien 3...The number of errors and non-logical events is just amazing. Anyone complaining about the lack of consistency in Prometheus (which was also much better than this one) will have the real hunting ground here. In fact, the more time passes after seeing the movie, the more nonsenses are detected. Don't think about this too much, anyway, its not worthy...The Nolan brothers used their imagination a little bit too much in the final part of the story, where the word ""magic"" (interchangeable with ""nonsense"") comes to mind. As the result, the viewer is left at the end indifferent to what is presented on the screen and does not care about the fate of the characters... Please recall the infamous Black Hole, and You will have the impression of what is going on here...The music is of course the extremely important part of every picture. If the composer knows his craft, the soundtrack complements the images, creating the flawless combo (as was in Terminator, Starship Troopers, Aliens, etc.). Here we have the attempt to create the epic atmosphere, but the events shown on screen are rather uninteresting, therefore the resulting impression is just the overwhelming noise, making the viewer angry instead of touching or moving him."
" Really a great watch
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,9,A great work yet again by Nolan. Everyone should view this movie once. According to me it's a perfect combination of science and adventure. But It's also pretty complicated. Earth is slowly becoming uninhabitable. So They go off to a planet to make sure its sustainable for life. Its pretty great... Oh and Interstellar grossed $675.1 million.
" Space movie
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,7,"This is a science fiction movie. The main character is Cooper. He is former pilot and has a son and daughter. One day, a food crisis is happened in the earth. He happens to find the NASA headquarters with his daughter. He is invited to join NASA's member as pilot. In order to save people in the earth, he goes to the universe. However, there is many difficulties. I think that the image quality is so high. Also, Using back ground music meets an atmosphere."
" Updated Space Odyssey is the best space sci-fi of the new century so far
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,7,"As of 2017, ""Interstellar"" is the best sci-fi space film of the 21st century. It was nearly 50 years since the first major film involving time travel and crossing dimensions in space. I wondered when someone would again pick up on the idea presented in the 1968 blockbuster, ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" ""Interstellar"" has that and more. It holds one's interest, even though the premise for the dying, over- populated earth was outmoded by the early 21st century. Low birth rates in all of the developed countries are projected to lead to population declines. Deaths will outpace births in most countries well before the mid-21st century. This is a departure from the more common alien creatures of sci-fi films. I do enjoy those type of films more. They are no more far- fetched than the notions of traveling back or forward in time. This film does a good job of trying to put credence to many theories. But, the film's ""science"" about time dilation, quantum gravity and wormholes is probably over the heads of 99.99 percent of viewers. One of the nice things about sci-fi is that it doesn't have to make sense. Aspects can be outlandish, bizarre and inconceivable. After all, that's what makes it fictional in the realm of science. The cast in this film all give good performances. The space scenes are very good as are all technical aspects and production values of the movie. I don't rate it any higher than seven because it doesn't provide the excitement or edge of seat anxiety that other sci-fi films provide. One should never take these films, or their plots too seriously. They are entertaining fiction, period."
" Best movie I've ever seen
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,10,"This movie is by far the most amazing movie I've ever seen. The lines, the emotions, the story telling, the music, everything about this movie evokes goosebumps on me and I cry every time I watch it, multiple times throughout the movie. The music is one of the big things for this movie. Hans Zimmer did a wonderful job composing the music and I thank him for leaving me with thoughts in my head and tears on my cheeks. Truly a masterpiece that needs to be talked about more, hardly any of my friends know about it and I find that sad. Matthew does a wonderful job as the protagonist and I love him as an actor. Please watch this movie, over and over and over again."
" A little overrated as all of Nolan's films
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,6,"Interstellar is itself a crescendo, increasing sensitivity and creativity. I use the term deliberately because it goes crescendo with the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, which is one of the most beautiful music ever scored for a sci-fi movie. We are witnessing a perfect musical arrangement, a total symbiosis, a bit like the music of Gravity which had understood very well how to match the image and the rhythm of a sequence to its own musicality. Zimmer's crescendos are giving a new powerful breath to every new scene, whether it is in visually powerful & intense moments or in more intimate moments; it intrudes into our momentary feelings and sensations, and manages to extend them, sometimes almost to choking, before resting on the balance of the film frame along with our mind spell-bounded. I have seen all the talent of the director that I knew he was outside the norm, but whom I did not know his capacity to reinvent itself. Because this is it: Interstellar is not an action movie, not really a blockbuster, and it goes not entirely but mostly again the expectations of common people. It's much more than that. This is much more than just a sci-fi movie. It is unlike any of his previous films. Some hoped to see Interstellar as Christopher Nolan's best film, and they were disappointed that this was not the case. And indeed, THIS IS NOT THE BEST FILM of Christopher Nolan. Because in a way, IT IS HIS FIRST FILM. I'm not saying that Interstellar is not as good as his other films, it goes beyond all of them. But to me Interstellar is the first film of a new stage in Nolan's filmography ; it is a masterpiece as it the beginning of a work ahead. Interstellar is the proof that Nolan has finally managed, despite all the expectations that were placed on him after the success of The Dark Knight, to move away from his own reputation to create a personal work, original, humble, sincere and deeply, meticulously, measured."
" Overall A great Movie.
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,8,"The movie keeps the audience captivated and asking for more. However focuses on a smaller market as not all people can understand it. Acting is very good. Highly recommend it if you are a sci-phi nerd. The Visual effects have been nicely done , however there are times when you could make out CGI from Real life. Overall a great movie with a great story line and great actors."
" A great movie with a great team.
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,10,"I might be young but i've seen a lot of movies. And i've got to say that this is one of the best movies i've ever seen.I know Christopher Nolan likes to play with time in his movies. But in this one time is actually a part of the story. There is also a lot of, what people would consider science fiction but it is actually just science.I've always been a fan of Christopher Nolan and Hans Zimmer. I think they're a great team and this movie wouldn't be the same without them.Matthew McConaughey is a great actor and i think he really proved it in this movie."
" Where physics takes a death spiral through a giant narrative blackhole
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,4,"If you deplore negative reviews of movies featuring your favorite director or actor, read no further. Okay, then ... I like science-fiction stories and movies, provided they both stick to the categorical facts and maxims of physics and quantum mechanics. Kubrick's masterpiece, 2001:A Space Odyssey (1967), in the main, is the quintessential example which sticks to those requirements. But if a story, such as this Interstellar, allows itself to fall into outrageous speculation, then it's not science: it's simple fantasy. Hence, in this movie, fiction is truly stranger than basic truth. Although it does have it's interesting moments....For example, the settings and special effects are simply outstanding; the artwork and CGI are also standout features. The acting, at times, is excellent, especially from McConaughey, Hathaway and Chastain. The supporting cast is generally up to par; and it was a pleasant surprise to briefly see William Devane once again - as an aging nasty, again. The best actors, for my money though, are the robots: TARS and the sort-of-eponymous CASE - both not only highly innovative and imaginative in form and behaviour, but also the best humour in the whole movie (of which there is very little).Regarding the physics aspect, the one thing the writers almost got right (about relativity and time dilation) was a well presented and excellent visual statement when Cooper (McConaughey) finally meets his grown-up daughter, Murph (Chastain). However, the remainder of the dialogue centering upon space travel, worm holes, black holes, gravity, time travel and so on is just full of ... well, holes. And, downright misinformation. Aaah, but it all sounds so cool....While I fully understand why it has a high (but undeserved) score, other inferior movies - The Abyss (1989), Close Encounters (1977), Titanic (1997) - achieve similar levels of approval. Still, this story is well structured without being unduly confusing. Direction, photography and editing are well up to Nolan standard of excellence, as you would expect. The sound track, however, is a tad loud for my liking; and, overall, the pacing is too slow and the overall length too long. Finally, as to the story itself - our dying planet, our need to survive, what can we do? - well, it's topical, important and now, an increasingly urgent issue. But this movie, deliberately or unintentionally, subverts viewers with its blatantly, saccharine banality that: Love conquers all. Meh! To nail things in perspective, this is not nearly as entertaining or imaginative as Inception, even though that one also classed itself wrongly as sci-fi. Overall, Interstellar is a movie only worth seeing if you have around three hours you don't mind using up, for better or worse. Give it four out of ten.

" Christopher Another thought of Seed become Universe That is Interstellar
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,10,"Christopher Nolan, I became fan of time after watch Dark Knight then go back to all his movies. When i saw Inception decided my one and only favourite director. Interstellar OMG can't expect about his inside thoughts, Even NASA praised this movie. Interstellar is a vision to NASA, A vision and Imaginary concept Christopher showed on the screen. Nobody wouldn't explain with understanding in scientific style.Explain about Black holes, Gravity,space ship travels and that space ship becomes time machine also, time spend on different planets- Christopher wow what a ideas. I do not understand few concepts till yet. Must watch movie number of times. 10 rating is also less value for this movie."
" Great film to watch when you have time
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,9,"So recently I have been sick and my ps4 is broken. I loved playing No Man's Sky on it, but now I can't. Being my bed ridden self I got my wife to go get a movie out so we can watch it together.I must say, I did not expect it to be this good. I thought it would be a trash, overrated film like Star Wars. When I saw it however it was just like No Man's Sky and the graphics were incredible. It is worth a watch for anyone who is interested in space exploration and felt that Star Trek and Star Wars are overrated and not worth their time.TL:DR It was like Buzz Lightyear had grown up into an astronaut"
" We Would Not Be Ones Going Thru The Wormhole. These People, Feh.
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,4,"This was sort of well reviewed when it was released. It is quite a burden to be original, dramatic, forward-looking, grand, important, in any space drama and have it be very good entertainment, let alone ""art"" (a la 2001). The makers of the movie were surely all too very conscious of the ""important"" space sci-fi films, which came before. Handicapped and burdened from that.I was aware of ""Interstellar"", but since I do not go to many movies, or do pay-per-view, the showing on cable tonight 7-26-2017 is the first time I've seen any of it. I tuned it at the point Cooper was shown into the space lab. I knew nothing of the story at this point. What did grab me to view was knowing of some upcoming space mission and that things were not going well in people's lives and on earth. Could not tell what year this was supposed to be happening in. Or why about much of anything that mattered to the story. All I heard were the characters babbling on.I tuned out late in the movie at the disastrous docking attempt. It was getting too bleak and cynical for me. I had to read a synopsis while viewing and decided to tune out at that particular point, and save seeing the beginning for another showing. Filling in plot made me less eager to go on. At least it did not include zombies. Tech that the US should not have had the ability to produce and launch, anymore in the world this movie conjured, was a problem in my mind. Did some billionaire fund this? Looking at these people, the should have gone all the way and everything crash and burn, with a coda of cold dark (or what, how is world supposed to be ending in ""Interstellar""? earth with a few relics as the pyramids remains standing. And a half buried black monolith sticking out of the dirt. That's it!"
" Interstellar (2014)
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,10,"The best film I would ever recommend but watch it I've seen it 7 times. I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of reviews on IMDb and everywhere, and never found the right movie to write my first review. I always thought I would wait for THE movie.And this is IT!When I first heard that Nolan was preparing a sci-fi movie, I felt like a kid again, waiting for his Christmas gift under the tree. I knew it would become a classic. And I'm sure it will.First of all, it is incredibly beautiful to watch. Honestly, it was so beautiful that I felt like I was sucked into the movie. The way Nolan decided to show some scenes really remind me of 2001 A Space Odyssey (actually many things will probably remind you of this movie). We can feel the talent of Christopher Nolan, just by looking at the way it is filmed. The techniques he used contribute to create that visual environment in a believable way.The sound environment is just mesmerizing. It is a very important part of the movie, because some scenes take place in space, and Noland just found the right way to use sound. The soundtrack (made by the great Hans Zimmer) is breathtaking, epic, amazing, unreal. I could find a lot more adjectives to qualify it, but you have to hear it to understand how epic they are. These two important parts (image and sound) create a stunning atmosphere. You will forget you are in a movie theater, and you will be lost in space, sucked into the adventures of this new Space Odyssey, begging for more. It is a truly unique experience. I can say that I have never felt something like that in a movie theater (at least not for the past ten years).Then, of course, the cast. First of all, Matthew McConaughey. I discovered this actor in Tropic Thunder, but he didn't really convince me, though he was quite funny. Then I saw Dallas Buyers Club. Since that movie, I love him. In this movie... Well, he is the movie. I exaggerate a bit, since there are other great actors (some even unexpected with a special guest) who play extremely well. But he is just what was needed to feel the human part of the story (which is very important in Interstellar). He is capable of making us feel so many different emotions all along the story, as a father, as a human. Anne Hathaway was very convincing, all together the actors managed to create some harmony, which makes the human interactions credible. Caine, Chastaing and Affleck are a perfect choice. And then there is... The special guest, I will call him ""X"". His role, which could be seen as a minor role, is actually much more important than that. He proves, once again, that he is a great actor. Watch and see.And finally, the scenario/story. I won't spoil anything here; I'll just try to convince you how great it is. Nolan is known to revolutionize everything when he tries a new genre in cinema. Well, once again he did it. With The Dark Knight he revolutionized the superhero genre. With Interstellar he's revolutionizing the sci-fi genre in cinema. From what I heard, he worked with a physicist (in gravitational physics and astrophysics) to help him with that movie. And we can feel and see it. During the fifties, Asimov laid the foundations of modern science fiction. Lucas and Kubrick did the same in cinema. Today, Nolan is laying the new foundations of the genre in cinema, proving that cinema is still at the beginning of what can be done (brace yourselves my friends, we have not seen anything yet). Why? Well, simply because we only know a few things about space, some things can't be proved for the moment, so we can use theory, and make the best of it. That is exactly what Nolan did. He used theories that exist today, and made a movie about mankind, about pioneers, about humanity, about us.Because, in spite of all the sci-fi aspect, it is a story about humanity. McConaughey, Hathaway, and mainly ""X"", will managed to convince you about that.My rating for this movie can only be a 10, because in itself, it is a beginning for a new kind of cinema. It IS a classic. Those who say ""we can't compare this movie to 2001 Space Odyssey, nor can we compare Nolan to Kubrick"" are wrong. We can, and we should. Talented people don't live only in the past, some genius live today, among us. And Nolan is one of them. Many say that he is overrated. I truly don't think so. Only time will answer that.This is the sci-fi movie of the decade, and probably the best movie Nolan ever made. Just go for it, without a second thought."
" Strange space travel story that has a silly ending but still an interesting Nolan film
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,6,"Christopher Nolan takes on space travel in a scientific thriller. Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is a scientist and former pilot haunted by his past accidents. He lives with his daughter Murph (Mackenzie Foy), son Tom (Timoth√©e Chalamet) and his grandfather Donald (John Lithgow). Murph is convinced that a ghost is in her room but Cooper tells her to use the scientific method. Crops are dying and people are assigned to their careers as resources are being consolidated. When Cooper finds a signal coming from Murph's room, Murph deciphers a binary code from the bookshelf. He follows the coordinates to a military base when he learns about a mission to space. The NASA scientist Brand (Anne Hathaway) takes Cooper to a meeting with her father (Michael Caine) and others including a robot.The mission hopes to search for a new habitable world and they invite Cooper to come along with his engineering and piloting skills. Despite a message from the bookshelf to stay, Cooper goes on the mission rocketing into space with Brand, Doyle (Wes Bentley), and Romilly (David Gyasi). Their search for habitable planets takes them through a black hole to a solar system with three potential planets. The biggest complication is gravity and relativity cause for a huge time jump that will change every hour into seven years back on Earth. The first planet is a water planet that has giant tidal waves heading towards their spaceship. Doyle is wiped out by the wave but Brand is saved by the robot. They are stuck on the planet for longer than they had hoped because the engines are waterlogged.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
" Thought provoking film
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,10,"Hubby and I watched a few months ago, and I have been remiss in my reviews. We both really liked this film. It really makes you think about life. I was still thinking about this movie days after watching. Excellent acting, cast, story, and special effects. I'm not great at understanding all the science/physics (whether it be verbiage or theory) so I think they did a great job of helping someone like me visualize and understand what was going on. It is a long movie and slow, but I like these kind of movies and it doesn't bother me."
" I'd rather do a PRT.
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,1,"I'll start out by saying that I invest in a ton of stock. A ton. After suffering through this, I'm pulling all of my money out of Netflix just in case they ever get afflicted with this cinematic equivalent of Ebola. Honestly, Ebola symptoms pale in comparison to what my reaction to this random series of talking pictures was. I even went so far as to buy all of the remaining tickets at AMC Silverdale for the rest of the evening on my smart phone so that no one else in the 360 area code had to be subjected to the inhumanity I was experiencing. Even if I only saved a few dozen souls, it was worth the $1854. I had to be escorted out of the building by security when I stood up during the black hole planet tidal wave scene and screamed profanities while simultaneously mooning the projector operator. I'm usually shy and reserved, but the lack of sound scientific evidence to support such a preposterous planet triggered me. I had the rare privilege of sitting next to an Auschwhitz Holocaust survivor and they informed me that the Third Reich had built a day- care compared to this virtual hell Christopher Nolan dreamed up. If I had the only time machine in existence, I would burn it to a white ash so that no time traveler can ever stumble upon this black plague. I listen to death metal, and I've never heard lyrics that even come close to describing the brutality and utter assault on the senses that this cacophony of misery presents.All that being said, the voice acting for TARS was on point."
" Best Sci-Fi Film of the decade
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,10,"A film like this is so rare these days in the world of Corporate money conscious producers who would rather sequel us to death with known stars and crappy stories so the wealthy continue to rake in billions. Christopher Nolan is one of the few bright spots. This saga is a full five act story that is great escapism. Great cast, wonderful soundtrack and an engaging story. He is the director I measure everyone else with!"
" It's what I dream of everyday, space travel, and exploration.
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,10,"I'm not critic, I probably can't even think of a good thing to say, but wow! was I blown away by this movie. It's not far fetched to think earth may end up like that, everything about this movie feels like something that could happen in the future. We have very little knowledge, and from what we know and what we understand a extra dimensional being can not exist. That's what I love about this movie, was it's ability to execute the impossible, and showcase an unthinkable future."
" Nolan's Breathtaking Masterpiece!
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,10,"A Stunning, Emotional, Breathtaking Masterpiece! Words cannot explain how sad this film is with exceptional performances from Matthew McConaughey and the brilliant Jessica Chastain. The amazing visuals leave you gasping for more and the scientifically accurate portrayal of space draws us as the viewer into a believable world. The use of practical effects makes me love this film even more, it shows to the viewers that actual effort was put into this amazing film!"
" A great sci-fi film with emotions
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,10,A lot of people will recommend the movie because of Christopher Nolan or visual effects but I'll say watch the movie for the story and for showing the father-daughter emotion so nicely. The scene where Cooper (McConaughey) meets his daughter Murphy before leaving for the mission and the scene where he meets her after the mission are the best ones. Must watch for everyone.
" Emotional, Intense, Science Fiction Masterpiece
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,10,"Phenomenal directing, fantastic writing, blissful composing, intense acting, and mind-blowing cinematography. What more could you ask for? For starters, it is becoming pretty clear that the Christopher Nolan/Hans Zimmer duo is unstoppable. If you are a fan of the style of their Batman Trilogy and Inception, then I find it hard to believe you'll find this movie to be anything but outstanding. If you are familiar with the shows Honest Trailers and Cinema Sins, then you'll be delighted to find out the Christopher Nolan has definitely done his homework on this film. In addition to the keen eye for detail he usually has, Nolan did new research on the science behind black holes, worm holes, and various other space aspects to create a scientifically accurate movie. Some speculation was required as many of the things researched are only theories, but they make the movie seem so much more plausible and real. Out of all of Nolan's works, this one has been my clear favorite. It does not require you to be a fan of space or science fiction to appreciate what has been put together in the two and a half hours of Interstellar. There are themes that everyone can connect to in this movie."
" The Best Sci-Fi movie Ever Made!!!
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is the best sci-fi movie ever made!And the best movie of 2014! Based on an era in the near future,where humanity is dying of crop failure due to severe dust storms,a team of space explorers from NASA must find an inhabitable planet for our survival! The movie is an epic space adventure where gigantic cinematic celestial landmarks are traversed to meet the potential planets! Using principles of Einstein's Equations of General Relativity,the movie uses the most accurate scientific aspect for science geeks which is beautifully woven in the screenplay and in the visual elements! The visuals for the rendering of black holes and giant tidal waves and wormholes use minimal CGI and maximum practical effects making the audience have the best cinematic experience! The score by Hans Zimmer is by-far his best composition ever!It pumps you up in every thrilling moment and makes you weep at silent-toned emotional moments and also connects oneself with the eternal! Deep down,it also is about a father-daughter love story and beautifully explores the concepts of time-dilation,living in isolation and relationships between the alive and the dead via scientific perspective explained for understanding of the common audience too! Overall,the movie is a thrill-ride on cinema-scale as an hour and 6 minutes of it was shot on IMAX film!The movie is so-far Nolan's most ambitious project and dwells into the hearts of its audience!!!"
" A truly mind blowing movie about the unknown possibilities in space.
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,9,"Ever get really deep in the thought of space travel and galaxy exploration tat you find yourself confused? Well I love the thought of Space and other galaxies to a point to where this movie answered all my questions and curiosities. That catch phrase , ""mind-blown"" is perfect for this movie. If you weren't already fascinated with the unknown about space you may just develop a new interest in it after you watch this awesome flick."
" Really Interesting movie from Nolan!
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,10,"This movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen! Everything is in the right place! The cast, background music, the story... The scientific theory behind it attracted me more than everything else! All these stuff made me watch this masterpiece 5 or 6 times! I really suggest you to watch it!"
" Science fiction masterpiece! Short review
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,10,"First of all, i wanna say that this movie really reminded me how life on Earth is magnificent and beautiful, which was probably one of the purposes of this masterpiece. Movie really has an excellent story, and it's very interesting since beginning til the end. Dialogs are very good and original, with perfect dose of humor for serious movie like this, and of course with right dose of emotions as well. Speaking of emotions, characters don't bore viewers with too long crying and grief in the scenes, but there is enough of this moments to make movie look realistic as Sci-Fi can be. There are a lot of details that give us a lot of information end explanation that make movie realistic from different angle(not just emotionally, but scientifically). People do what would they probably do in real life, if they find themselves in hard situations from the movie. I like that the movie follow story from two different angles (from people of Earth, and from astronauts themselves). Visuals was really good and entertaining, with amazing special effects. All in all this movie is one of the best, if not the best Sci-Fi movie of all time."
" Go-to movie for Leisure
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,10,"This is my go-to movie any day of the week! One of my favorites that I force on everyone I become close friends with. I really enjoy the hope that is displayed in Interstellar. To me, it is an empowering production that makes me feel like I can do similar things to Matthew McConaughey's character. The production style of Christopher Nolan is heartwarming and a much needed wake up call to the antagonists of climate change on Earth. I would wholeheartedly recommend this movie no matter what your interests, but would recommend reading The Science of Interstellar if you are not particularly strong in the science field!"
" Ultimately this movie is entertaining
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,6,"Nolan really tries to make you cry with this one. I have never seen him use such powerful emotions in his movies; however that is not necessarily a good thing for this movie, given that he uses his time trying to develop a family relationship at the expense of flow and congruency. Again, the Visuals are completely off the charts. The visual imagery is truly beautiful and something that Nolan has always excelled at. Given that the most visually stunning movie in recent years, Gravity, recently came out, Interstellar does not lag behind and shows you a spectacle of Visual effects.He will most likely win Visual effects at the Oscars. The Hans's score is marvelous and will most likely earn an Oscar nomination. Matthew Mcconaughey's acting is good, but nothing stellar, especially coming off the best acting role of his career. He plays the character like it should be played, but Nolan's characters never being truly drawn out or rounded does not help him any.The same can be said for the rest of the cast. The little girl was marvelous though. I do not want to reveal any piece of the story whatsoever, but i have to say, it is one of the most original scripts i've ever seen. Ultimately this movie is entertaining. There is no way Nolan can miss that. Another great thing that Nolan excels at is INSPIRING. By the time the credits rolled and people walked out, I sat there still in awe at the strong sense of human will the movie conveys. Personally, I don't think this is Nolan's best. I believe Memento stands as his masterpiece. But with Nolan, everyone has their own favorite movie. Maybe for some, Interstellar will be their favorite movie, for it is really Nolan's most ambitious and visually-striking work. By the way, Anyone else who even tries to compare Interstellar to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is out of their mind. Kubrick's mission was to create art. Nolan in ""Interstellar"" sets to awe and inspire its audiences. It is truly a great piece of work."
" I'm wondering how this got such a good rating...
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,2,"Interstellar has some good points, and some very bad points entertainment wise...First of all, the movie is extremely boring...which may tickle some people I suppose. Literally the first half of the movie is some sort of family affair for the stars, with shots of their flying a drone, and experiencing a huge dust storm at their big farm...only to have McGaunahey and his daughter go off searching for some ultra secret space base out in the boonies, where they find out there is a plan to go through a wormhole to somewhere else...Then we have a crazy robot that is a clone for the mystery obelisk in 2001. This robot never does anything much,except wiggle its segments and occasionally respond to voice...Then the trip into space, on a Saturn 5 rebuild, that links up to a spacecraft fixture in space, which promptly begins revolving to produce pseudo-gravity...A boring flight out to Saturn, through the wormy hole, and we arrive at somewhere else, supposedly a planet...land ""in"" the water, get thrashed by a tsunami, and here we are...still no solid plot at all...I remember watching the movie Contact, which was boring in it's own way, but this one is ten times worse...only one step above awful..."
" Absolute Masterpiece
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,10,I saw this movie after two and a half years of its initial release but I regret not watching it in theater. This is a masterpiece. Only thing I can say about the movie is that it is Brilliant and absolutely Masterpiece. Christopher Nolan has outdid himself(Incepetion is another masterpiece but this is whole new level of brilliance).
" Worst Nolan Movie?
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,2,My wife and I LOVED Memento and The Prestige and we don't agree on movies all that often. The Batman movies were clearly made by committee but watchable. Interstellar started well. I haven't seen a high dollar film deteriorate into ham-handed Scifi clich√© since I can't remember when! 8.2??!!?? We're so disappointed in you all! I wish the best for Dunkirk but am suspecting it will be the next Red Tails...
" Time, will see this movie stand it's test and remain in the top.
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie twice. Once at the cinema and once at home.And let me say that I considered this to be the kind that you only see once. Because it is a powerful movie that relies on feelings to get the message through, not on action - that you can look at again and again, from time to time, to pass the time... when you have the time. :) I was able to enjoy it a second time, and breathlessly I might add, because the first time I was just a man belonging to a woman, and the second time, now, I was, am, the father of a 2 years old daughter. Throughout the entire movie I had lots of moments when I felt the need to look upon my daughter who was sleeping peacefully next to me. I felt a connection, that's how good Nolan is. Cooper's lines (involving his daughter) are convincing, that's how an educated man would treat his daughter, he is believable. Now, I don't emphasize on the father-daughter drama in the movie because I consider it to be the central piece - it is not - it is the perfect catalyst for the delivery of the powerful and most complicated theories of relativity and space-time; important messages about the dangers that our frail world faces and also the will and potential of mankind to overcome those dangers and flourish beyond them. Combined with some astonishing visuals, strong music and a very realistic, down-to-earth futuristic design and tech, and given the fact that I think that science fiction is the ultimate kind of art :) I think ""Interstellar"" is the most awesome piece of cinematography that I have laid my eyes upon. The repeating use of ""time"" is intended ;)"
" Stupidest sci-fi of all times
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,1,"The movie is missing beginning, middle and end. Disaster. I don't recommend spending a penny on this movie. It is difficult to believe that some one can rate for this more than 2 starts honestly. NASA being so secret, yet everyone sees it launching rockets. Building is a ship, how come you did not get that??? Woow, aha yeah, the guy that should save the world, he BTW lied! Lovely, can you guys make it any more stupid than it is???"
" Kitschy overlong soap opera.
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,3,"It's embarrassing to think that stories like this are mistaken for SciFi.As for the ""Sci"" it only helps to drag a long a family story into - probably (who knows) - eternity and back.Whenever the story gets stuck some miracle ""scientific fact"" appears to help it move along. By the way, that Mathew M. actor ... who can he convince of being in a position to be chosen for all the stuff that role is capable of....Of course you get the clich√© robot and the clich√© computer (√† la HAL) and all the rest of it. I guess Zimmer is a good composer but this constant barrage of holier- than-holy church music only now and then interspersed with kitsch is only letting you know how you should be on your knees in tears regarding this ""universal story of love and family"" ... I'm guessing this has to be one of the slogans to market this soap opera over x amount of galaxies ... or one ... who cares.A few stars for the visual stuff but the content ... oh the content ..."
" Excellent 3 hours length movie
",2017-06-03 00:00:00,10,"This movie is amazing. Sound effects. Realistic feeling throughout the movie. It makes you feel like you are with them. I don't think there has been a space movie this good. I am totally effected by this movie. Christopher Nolan really did a great job. I think the most important part is that CGI was used very few times.Despite the fact that it is almost a 3 hour movie, the time just passes really quick. Wish it never ended."
" Ordinary People and Extraordinary People
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,8,"Yeah, Ordinary People and Extraordinary People are different.Or i like to say uneducated people mostly can't understand this movie. This is the most accurate movie about space, time and galaxy. Not just some fantasy. It based from the theory of earth scientist. It's Nolan. In Nolan we trust and we will get more Extraordinary movies directed by him. Never disappointed."
" Best space movie yet?
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is the perfect movie for those needing an extra touch on inspiration in whatever area of life. The journey of this film is thrilling, moving and amazing. There is no doubt this is one of the best film visuals yet to exist. On top of the that, the music by Hans Zimmer has you at the edge of your seat. Love the movie."
" Interstellar is the greatest film I've ever seen and is god like.
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar is a science fiction masterpiece directed by the one and only Christopher Nolan. Starring Matthew McConaughey as Cooper, a man who is human and breathes oxygen. Then he goes to space and gets succ'd into a black hole lol. I am only doing this to complete my profile but Interstellar is a literal god send of a movie thank you Nolan boy."
" Attractive Imaginary Movie with Logic by Christopher Nolan
",2017-05-31 00:00:00,9,"Watched this movie more than 5 times to understand the logic used in the movie. Everything is flawless, its worth to watch. I become a fan of Christopher Nolan, after watching Interstellar, started watch all his previous movies like memento, inception, dark night, prestige. He is having wonderful talent and next James Cameroon.."
" Good story and production but one major flaw
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,6,"Whoever the genius was that cast Matthew McConaughey as a super- intelligent astronaut, completely funked up what otherwise would have been a highly rated sci-fi drama.Sorry but brilliant scientific observations and explanations just don't sound credible coming from a typecast smooth talking lady's man sporting a redneck accent. It's awkward and I just couldn't get past it.Russell Crowe, George Clooney... anyone but Matthew McConaughey and this might have risen to the level of ""great."""
" An amazing, beautiful sci-fi epic
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,8,"Where do I even begin.. Interstellar is about Cooper, a man who discovers the coordinates of a secret NASA base through a Morse code message. Cooper goes on a mission in space to go through a wormhole in order to discover a habitable planet, since Earth has seen better days. This film is really, really confusing and mind-bending. There's a scene where Cooper falls into a 5-dimensional tesseract then he proceeds to send his daughter the coordinates of the NASA base through gravity and Morse code. Basically, he sent himself to space from space in order to send himself to space. What the hell. Besides that, Matthew McConaughey's role of Cooper is amazing, the special effects were great, Hans Zimmer's musical score is FREAKING AMAZING, and the scientific accuracy is pretty much dead on. I recommend everyone to watch this film. I would give it a 8/10."
" The astrophysics are speculative however...
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,9,"This film redefines the science-fiction genre. Despite its obvious flaws with regards to physical phenomena and multiple unexplained plot holes, Interstellar is a cinematic masterpiece. I had the opportunity to view this film in IMAX and it simply blew me away. Undoubtedly McConaughey's best role to date, Interstellar wows with incredible visuals and cinematography and once again Hans Zimmer re-emphasises his status as the best cinematic composer in the business. Anne Hathaway is solid as usual and Jessica Chastain bolsters the already superb cast as Murphy Cooper. 9/10."
" Dreaming about future and science
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,10,"Mathew left his ""handsome guy custom"" and act like a real hero, a lovely father, an rude astronaut, an furious pilot to save the world where lives his daughter. Nolan accept the challenge and present a beautiful picture about love, humanity, science across space and time possible time travel in unique cinema representation about 5 dimension. Is lovely, stunning, heroic, touchable.. is one of the best movies ever."
" That's one small step for dimensions and one giant leap for stupidity
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,7,I tried to watch this movie before but it was so bad that I stopped. When I was reading the comments for Arrival one of them said that Interstellar is better. They didn't like Arrival but I thought Arrival was the best SF movie since 2001. I decided to give Interstellar another look and found out I was right the first time. The acting was OK but I feel there should be more to science fiction movies than interstellar drag racing or sh-- like Independence Day and ET. Although ET did have a sentimental side which was OK. But the reality of just where the human race is in this mystery of universal creation makes using escapism in SF movies a low blow. That is if you do read and not just get your deeper thoughts from movies and TV. Interstellar had too much in consuming action and not enough in suspense. The way he was caught in a time dimension when coming back was shown in an interesting way but it stayed there too long. Unless your a farmer in the flatland Midwest the sentimental side is wasted. Considering the time it took and the value it gave I would give it a 7.2 at the most.
" That's It.
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,9,"There is a lot to learn from this movie. In the entire movie you never know whats going to happen next!! Even after the movie ends, you still are in some kind of illusion!! I don't know how a man can think this far. Hats off to the cast and the people behind creation of such a masterpiece!!"
" Trump in space: America First
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,1,"Little bit too late ? No, it's always advisable to squash the garbage if and when it falls into your path. Nolan brothers promised, as James Rocchi put it, ""outer-space majesty and deep-thought topics like some modern variation on Stanley Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". Interstellar, as absolute ""A""production, is one of the worst films ever made by Hollywood ! It fails in every department, both science & fiction (fantasy) in ""SciFi"" are ridiculous, but that was never good enough reason for failure: many ""SciFi"" films failed in science- fiction but excelled as films in story telling, acting, plot, details, dialogues, etc. This one is so awful that I can't decide where to begin. If I could, most obvious starting point would be it's infantile plot and dialogues (love ""transcends the limits of time and space"", ),... no, it would be idea of faux all-American heroism, patriotism masked as faux concern for ""human race"", faux American superior technology, and mythological unshakable will to go forward in the face of ultimate, apocalyptic adversity - who is better suited for ""riding"" NASA's rocket through the ""wormhole"" so that he can save the world, then white-Christian farmer-engineer-pilot from Texas !? As David Edelstein writes, ""Nolan & his brother, Jonathan, clearly wants Interstellar to be a great American epic ‚Äî The Grapes of Wrath II: The New Vintage"". Eh, the amount of pathos: patriotism, family, American mythology & heroics - I was, I am, all cowed ! Only great act of entire movie is Michael Caine's dying scene, but you have to try really hard to remove his Dylan Thomas reciting from your mind first.Ehhhh... Cooouuupeh, take us to the starsssssseh !Deus Ex McConaughey"
" A Masterpiece
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,10,"This movie doesn't feel like a movie to me, it is a dream like journey that I never get bored of. each time I want to re watch a movie, immediately Interstellar is the first to cross my mind. Recommended for all space and science lovers. the soundtrack in Interstellar is amazing on one hand and totally fits the main subject of the film and the scenes, this music itself can give you the feeling of being in space, isolated, too faraway and the unknown destiny kind of feeling. totally this is why this movie is absolutely worth the watch and re watch. the performance of the lead actor is beyond description, he killed it and I would say that he added more weight to the movie as well to his character. the science theories in this movie and the sophisticated scientific language makes it a movie for special audience and many people would not like it and feel bored. but for the concerned people, it is a one in a million movie. Thanks Mr. Nolan and all the contributors"
" There is really nothing out there so far like this
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,10,I randomly selected and watched the movie. I was amazed like nothing before. The soundtrack was the most amazing although I had to hear it few times to get the emotions right. The human connection is far more important and relatable than the sci-fi shenanigans on which most sci-fi movies relies. It touches on few emotions that are usually triggered under unusual circumstances.
" Mediocre
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,7,"I really hoped this would be a good movie but unfortunately it was not even mediocre. I rated it at 7 but now after some consideration 5 would have been more appropriate. The film is far too long, the plot is even for a sci-fi too silly to be believable. Like some others have pointed out, why place the wormhole next to Saturn if it was supposed to help people on earth? Did they do it out of spite? The properties of the black hole are not even remotely close to scientific knowledge."
" Theory of Relativity
",2017-05-05 00:00:00,10,"This Movie is Awesome, The Writer have extensive research on Albert Einstein's Theory of Relativity, Space Time/Time Dilation. Audience Once Understand This Movie can make them Love Physics. Story is good. Never found an equivalent of this Movie even like this movie. Some People don't understand and say this is Not good."
" Movie Science
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,10,"Simply put, best space epic movie I have seen in a long time! *spoiler* when you see the black hole for the first time (IMAX/large screen format) a sense of wonder and fear overcomes you. in the depths of your mind and soul you suddenly realize, that is exactly what it would look like, and you are propelled into that very moment. As they slip past the event horizon and you see, what I can only describe as reality warps, a memory jumps to the for front of another movie, CONTACT, in which a similar sequence happened and at that time, it was the best space epic movie I had seen. Kip Thorne, a Theoretical Physicist, did the most amazing work to help bring this visualization to life and keep it based in the real world instead of creating a fantasy world built to entertain children and the simple minded."
" Where and what are we in this universe and what is our salvation?
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,10,"well, I have seen this film many times over and over, and each time it has revealed something new to me. a multi-layered sci-fi feature with deep philosophical meanings and humanistic concepts! a genius film from a genius master filmmaker!with a profound and completely scientific story line, mixed with the emotional and human texture, this is the story of our future, if we keep destroying our mother! on the other hand, what mesmerizes me is the music! the music is the asset which makes this masterpiece even more exciting and at the same time emotional. the scientific facts of the film are so logical, and indeed SCIENTIFIC! even though we haven't reached to that kind of technology yet, this film makes you wonder about the existence and human values every time that you watch it! I am not a professional critic, but I can surely say that without a doubt, this is one of the greatest films of the history, make by two of the greatest masterminds in the history of cinema! the Nolan Brothers! I am not even going to talk about the acts and visual effects and other technicalities, which were far greater than anything we have seen before."
" A bouquet of perceptions: visuals& emotion
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"Honestly, this was the best movie I ever saw and I'm going to tell you why:
* FIRST, the script was PERFECT -Matthew McConaughey's acting, besides being flawless (I'm talking about facial expressions, tones, intensity, looks) during the entire movie, Cooper asked the right questions, his dialogue was so on point (for example, he didn't jump right in the spaceship when they asked him to do so, like in a typical blockbuster)
* SECOND, the scenes were absolutely beautiful. Nolan was top of the class again. He has, undoubtly, the best taste when it comes to capture just the right image in every situation - Interstellar being, maybe, it's best yet - one of the main rasons that the movie won the Academy Award. The 5th dimensional room scene was something truly innovative& very, very emotional at the same time - I shamelessly shed a tear seeing such a powerful well-written scene.I've always thought this way: when it comes to movies, the script is everything. After seeing Interstellar, I've decided to put this movie on a pedestral, calling it ""The Holy Bible"" of motion pictures.
It's an ageless must-see."
" Long w/Visual Candy
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,10,The story is well written no doubt.Lots of contracting colors to look at through the film.Characters are well cast.Probably will have to watch it twice.Story goes fast in the end.
" Review
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,8,"Matthew McConaughey is a well-starred in the film but it seems to me that it was not for this role. There are many good ideas for the film script is very good, and good is all done.When you give a critique of this film would be only the end of the film.I'm not saying 10-star reviews on this site are phony; after all, major film critics also are raving about Interstellar. Unfortunately, I find most professional film critics about as credible as the physics in this movie.When to create another film in such a similar way it would be a hit."
" A work of art from Nolan
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar did an incredible job of keeping the viewer on edge and did not reveal too much information and kept the viewer wondering throughout the film. I particularly enjoyed the fact that it seemed possible. Despite being fiction, the events that took place in the film could potentially occur in the future, so I think that's something that really drew me in."
" Nitpicking, I must
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,8,"Ice is too heavy to form clouds that just magically hang in the air. Even the film's science adviser Kip Thorne isn't sure about them. ""These structures go beyond what I think the material strength of ice would be able to support,"" he told Science magazine. ""Every time I watch the movie, that's the one place where I cringe."" Pretty but sadly not possible."
" Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here.
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,10,"Mankind was born on Earth. It was never meant to die here.""Interstellar"" is a movie you should watch instead of reading a review on it. It is an excellent Sci-fi drama that keeps you tensed while you're watching it and leaves you speechless afterwards.The movie begins in 2060, the Earth has changed greatly from the planet we live on today. The setting is quite depressing: due to global disasters such as famine and drought, there is no chance for the humankind to survive on the Earth.The main character is Joe Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, is an ex-scientist engineer and pilot who now lives on his corn farm with his father and two children: a 15-year-old son Tom and a 10- year-old daughter Murph. Joe leaves his family to try to save the mankind by finding a new planet it can inhabit.What I love about ""Interstellar"" is the effect it produces. Some people say that something might be considered to be art as long as it leaves an emotional mark, whether it is positive or not. I believe this movie is one of the best movies of this decade. It left me and the people I know not only speechless but it made me think of it for days. Perhaps to get the effect you should've watched it on a big screen but it is worth trying to watch it on a smaller one.To sum up, ""Interstellar"" is a great movie with a logical story line,heartbreaking drama, and well-written characters. What I believe is also very important is that the director of the movie, Christopher Nolan, who also directed the Dark Knight trilogy, ""Inception"", ""the Prestige"", etc., had a physicist astrophysicist's help not to make a fool of himself when it came to laws of physics, even though it is still a Feature Film, not a Documentary One."
" Never get this 3 hours back
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,1,"I absolutely hate when people are trying to sell their st@pid ideas as fantastic to the public. This is what happened here in this movie. Not going to list all the fake, unbelievable events and happenings in the movie, you can read it in other 1 reviews. Have to say most of the public who find it amazing are dumb@sses who have no clue about science or even how to put together a good story. Don't even try to understand what's happening because it doesn't make sense and it's obvious the writer doesn't have a monkey about space and stars. Who is this Nolan to write script about this topic? Is he educated in space science? Did he even contact some professors before he put together his dumb ideas? Absolutely not believable, and boring, and annoying, and etc. One of the worst crew I've seen in terms of chemistry or even regarding individual performances. Matthew looked horrible throughout the whole movie AND ORANGE. Looked funny next to Anne with her white pale skin. Anyways Matthew is not a person who is pleasant to look at for 2-3 hours. He aged quite badly, would never believe he had anything to do with science in his life. His square head and orange skin plus the wrinkles were sooo annoying. Not much actor quality either. Anne Hathaway tried to look like a 13 year old boy and she never looked more ugly. Never expected much actress performance from her but she didn't even need it as her role was what? Crying? Haha. Jessica Chastain is usually great, but even her reactions were forced, her face was ugly and just annoying. I could say this about everybody else except maybe for Casey who was the only one believable in his role. Funny enough he played an abusive character. The make up, hair, looks, were horrible for everybody. The space environment.... looked seriously plastic and so so cheap. Obviously very low quality did not believe for 1 sec they were in the space. Or another planet. I could put together these scenes from cutting papers. Ultimately Im really disappointed in the quality of the audience as if this is what they need and what they value as 10, then there's really something horrible happening to our planet and maybe we don't need to be saved! Nolan sold it, good for him, but it does not mean he did a quality job in any way. What a load of BS for 3 hours!"
" Interstellar exists
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,9,"In an effort to not give away any information... I won't do that. Interstellar is a movie that exists. While that's not exactly rare, it's more than can be said for some films, like Geoff's Daily Laundry: The Movie. Interstellar has characters, who also exist. Not in real life, they're fictional, but in the movie's universe they exist. Matthew Mcconaughey doesn't exist in the film's universe, or everyone would say, ""Hey, (main character's name), you're Matthew Mcconaughey!Overall, I rate this film 9/12.67 Worth a watch A cheap one, not an expensive one."
" A lost space film with really good points
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,9,"Honestly this film to me isn't bad, but it does have some points that seem to make the film look like a messy masterpiece with missing moments than a complete film. The story is about a former astronaut turned farmer, mission to search for life on other planets. Within the first hour the film is pretty organized, until a major plot point in the story occurs (I am not going to name it to spoil the film) which then turns the seemingly almost masterpiece into a lost film. Story: 4 1/2 starsNow the characters I have to have admiration for because of their usefulness to the story's plot. Characters: 5 starsThe directing sure is really good, but should have had more motivation and organization. Directing: 4 1/2 starsOverall the film is a really good masterpiece, but not an organized one to me."
" Dumb and dumber
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,1,"Great movies make you think. ""Think"" as in truly ponder over issues -love, hate, science, whatever- and coming up with your own findings. Usually this kind of movie is subdued, restrained, small in scale -gives you the space you need to think. They present us with a conundrum and let us solve it -if it can be solved at all.This movie is the exact opposite of that. Nolan movies are not known for subtlety and restraint -and this one might be the loudest, biggest, and I'm afraid dumbest of them all. The movie grabs you by the throat and slap you in the face a million times, yelling ""we have serious problems here and this is the solution, and if there is a later twist I'll just give you a louder new solution, but don't you dare objecting to what you're given"". Even the supposedly intimate scenes feel like instructions: when we see Dr. Cooper crying over his daughter's cruel recorded message, we almost see a cue card in the background ""... and now, dear audience... cry!"".To worry about the future of mankind is absolutely valid. To make room for human emotions in scientific problems is even more valid. But to spend three hours of dazzling visual effects and loud background music to tell us what we should think about all that is cheap and worthless."
" One of the Best Movies of all time...
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,10,"At first, when I watched this movie it just hypnotized me for months. Christopher Nolan probably is the only director who could create a masterpiece like this. From the beginning till the end nowhere, not even a single second it disappoints you. and when it comes to soundtrack and background score, just one-word ""epic"". Hanz Zimmer should have got Oscar for the music even the movie too. Matthew McConaughey is at his best and deserved an Oscar. Anne Hathaway and the whole cast is excellent, though. even the robots tars and case get you emotionally. If you haven't watched interstellar it 'll be your biggest mistake. watch it and experience awesomeness. I would give 1000 out of if I had an option. Thank you, Nolan, for giving us Interstellar."
" Pretentious, self-important and void of fun
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,6,"'Interstellar' is a three hour movie marathon that contains too few redeeming features to make it worth your time. Going into this movie, everybody would have expected an extremely well made, visually beautiful spectacle, and that's what you get. However, everything else about the film is a disappointment.Sitting staring at a screen for three hours is no fun, unless of course you're watching something entertaining enough to take your mind off it. Throughout 'Interstellar', I found my mind wandering, and I must admit to feeling a sense of relief when the whole thing was over. The film just isn't sufficiently interesting to justify such a long running time.Whilst visually impressive, 'Interstellar' is void of fun. In fact it's void of anything that will make you change your expression. This is just one long, pretentious and self-important film that isn't anywhere near as good as the ratings suggest."
" Gritty sci-fi that emotes realism
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,9,"Almost all science fiction concepts are statements regarding humanity, or the lack there-of. They require intricate concepts, not hi tech spaceships, to inspire afterthought. Here we have a mixture of realism both on the emotional aspect of the film as well as in the bells and whistles of space travel. They don't all ring true in the end as the Nolans have add fourth dimensions and love as a throwback to the silliness of other more formulated and accessible movie formats. The interesting thing here is that the Matt Damon character is such a coward, ""don't judge me"" while looking up at the ""stars"" of his grandiose existence. he represents scientists and much as anyone else in the film. It's heartbreaking as well, but that keeps us going. The pacing is the hidden gem of the film. The dust bowl effect plays well to the realism of American history and of desperate times while the science is above my pay grade, but didn't distract from my enjoyment of the experience."
" infinite-dimensional
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,9,"Interstellar moves me to an infinite-dimensional with 120 minutes of amazing EPIC, story and scenes. Our earth has been fulled with crowds and dark future, i felt how much the human in need to discover a new space livable dimensions. But i am not sure if that scientific theories are able to process. Whatever, I will not hide that sense of entertainment i felt while watching ""Interstellar"". Really it is More than excellent movie."
" Nice poetry, vapid science.
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,6,"One thing I learned from great movies is that they have their quality aspects proportional to each other. You imagine what you get if you have great acting and poor directing, or great directing and poor story, or great story and poor focus.What do we have in this movie? Great acting, great directing, great poetry, and absurd scientific claims, which kills the joy of watching the movie if you are a little aware of the principles of modern physics.If you are an artist or musician, or anyone who has no knowledge about quantum mechanics, relativity, and modern cosmology, you can go and watch this movie and enjoy its great poetry. If you, however, have some knowledge I warn you that you may feel distrust and disappointment to the whole story and start blaming all the actors and the director for making such serious efforts while the story is scientifically absurd.I mean if the director (and the rest) intend to create a sci-fi movie they must avoid too detailed and serious explanations of how things happens in the universe (with serious faces). This reflects their ignorance and spoils the poetry of the movie.I can bring few facts from the movie that is nonsense and they needed to avoid it.1. A warm hole is a theoretical concept, and in practice no one even remotely knows what it is yet. 2. You may travel through a warm hole, but you cant direct yourself to a particular planet. 3. A black hole has several orders of magnitude more gravity and warmth than the sun, anything falling into it burns down and becomes about the size of an atom. The protagonist would be dead long before reaching its center. 4. And all this nonsense of looking to our particular earth from the black hole just because it has different dimensionality ... I don't even want to talk about it. 5. After 30 years their children needed to think about other life related things as well, and not sitting and talking about their father's mission all the time (be a bit realistic about life). 6. The biggest nonsense - after years father and daughter are meeting and just smiling and crying. This is not an American drama folks, the man has been in another galaxy and see the most unnatural thing in life: his daughter is 80 years old. They both should have been perplexed, got panic attack, feel extreme feelings, collapse or something. What the hell was that? A meeting with tears and smile?To sum up: The immensity of the universe and its effect on human aspect is is poorly explored. There should have been abnormal feelings going on in the move due to this, but we saw none!"
" Hard science and human drama, married with the help of cutting-edge VFX
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,7,"Version I saw: UK IMAX releaseActors: 7/10Plot/script: 6/10Photography/visual style: 8/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10Christopher Nolan is one of the most trusted directors in the film industry, with a flawless record of large box-office profits. As a result, when he asks for $160 million to make an epic sci-fi original project, studio execs set aside their usual reservations and stump up the cash without question.Interstellar is visually spectacular, with digital imaging grounded in the hard physics equations of scientific consultant Kip Thorne. However, it also marries this with human drama by exploring the personal impact of the phenomena discussed. As a result, we get dramatic close-up scenes of both star Matthew McConaughey and major support Anne Hathaway, highlighting their considerable acting talents.Admittedly, it isn't Nolan's best, as high a bar as that is. Interstellar starts too slowly, and the climax is just preposterous, arguably throwing away all the scientific credibility it had earned up to that point. It is suitably poetic though, with the right emotional impact (supported by Hans Zimmer's excellent church organ score), and as I say, visually breathtaking.I am grateful to Nolan for using his industry cred for pushing through work like this, of a type we don't see much any more."
" Very overrated
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,5,"I have lost interest in the rest of this movie after the scenes where I saw a farmer carrying equipment to hack drones, NASA putting a guy on duty who got issues with his family and crying like a drama queen while driving to work, and an astronaut explaining worm-hole-time-travel to another astronaut using a pen and paper while on the mission.The bad acting of the leading actor trying to sound 'cool' in every dialog was very annoying. This movie is way too dumb for a standard 'sci-fi'. The production is great though, but not enough to cover the overall dumbness."
" After watching Interstellar
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,10,"After watching Interstellar, do yourself a favor and get lost in space and time and go back in time to see Contact (1997) and 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) to further wonder and wander into the realms of the unknown.Because sometimes it is the unknown that fascinates us, frightens us and brings out the best in us."
" One of my favourite movies of all time.
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,10,I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan. I love his movies and this is one of his best till date. The movie is a perfect blend of emotion and action. It beautifully shows the complex father-daughter relationship between Cooper and Murphy. It is also one of the most scientifically accurate movies ever made. I absolutely loved it.
" My most liked sci-fi!!!
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,10,"all about this movie is for me just one big tense feeling...i cant describe it with words enough :-) The idea in story line is amazing and powerful. I know its just a movie, but when you realize and sense feelings all of characters, you are just full of it. It cant be stopped its so tense. Maybe they are people who can understand what i mean :-)"
" Good idea turned wrong
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,6,"I find this film to be overrated by those that are liking it and underrated by those that are hating it, the overall score now is over 8, it is a little bit too much, other movies better than this one (for instance 2001: A space Odyssey) have a lower score and is a bit unfair that this flick is on pair or slightly over in IMDb score over that film. The cast is a mixture of good and bad, Matthew McConaughey acting, for instance, is good, Anne Hathaway so and so, Matt Damon, again, so an so, John Lithgow is OK, Michael Caine is OK (but is too old for his part, the casting is an issue, I will add more on this topic), Jessica Chastain is OK, so is the younger Murphy portrayed by Mackenzie Foy but the older Murphy portrayed by Ellen Burstyn is unconvincing. The supporting cast is, for the most part, forgettable, unidirectional and cartoonish (for instance the robots, the son Tom, the crew etc.). The script/plot is the main issue of the film, from the beginning we are introduced in a future society that has crop/food/drought problems due to climate changes and mildew. But these problems could not be planetary as we know that our planet does not have just a continent and the climate on those five continents differs dramatically, for instance Siberia has a totally different climate that Australia or India. Again if you have climate problems in middle of USA chances are, in the real life, that in northern Canada these problems will turn in advantages on your part, so why not re-settle in more advantageous regions on Earth instead of going directly into deep space with plan A (the whole planetary population towards another galaxy!!), this is the first and the biggest hole in the main plot. The second major issue of the script is the whole NASA business, it is secret, but somehow have huge funding for deep space programs, the government (a Orwellian one, no more or less) denies that space is a priority but secretly invest in it (why? we don't know and the script writers have no idea, too¬Ö) and finally in the whole world only NASA/USA have deep space programs, the others¬Ö no, they do not bother with space and the film makers are not bothered with them, too. Finally, the whole gravity/physics/equation/wormhole/black hole thing is again a very big plot hole. Firstly the professor get to the conclusion that Plan A (the whole population in space thing) can't be done (duh!) and secretly arrange Plan B(embryos in Cryostasis) without the knowledge of the space crew. All the pseudo-scientific theories regarding the fabric of time, gravity,black holes etc. are improbable and unbelievable, I know, it is an SF,but this part of this plot is too much especially the ghost part and entering of the black hole thing, with the fabric of time manipulated and equation solved by Coop and Murph in a very bad written scene. On top of this plot holes add a whole lot of bad Hollywood clich√©s and bad casting choices (for instance professor Brand, a 80 year old Cockney has a 30 year American Jewish daughter, young Tom is a Midwestern boy that turn into an East Coast fellow in his 40s, old Murphy is English, the young and midlife are not etc.) The movie has good potential, some parts are good, with beautiful scenes, but is again a case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, as in many big Hollywood movies lately. The idea and script had potential, the cast had too. The CGI effects are OK, do not expect a heavy fight flick with shoot the alien between the eyes at every 30 seconds, as in Edge of Tomorrow for instance, a truly bad, over the top SF, no, it is a more thinking man SF but ultimately it fails due to the bad plot/scenario. This movie was a good idea turned wrong, it is a 6, 6.5 grade at best!"
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,5,"Christopher Nolan is the smartest writer/director in Hollywood, so smart that a lot of people claim his films are over their heads. The master of twists and deception made Batman real, showed us how dreams work in Inception, and brought us inside the dangerous world of magic in the Presitige. In his latest film, Interstellar, Nolan tackles the concept of time and how different it is from what we perceive. This film does have a great twist in the end and some terrific special effects, but beyond that it is one of the longest and slowest moving films I've seen in years. Once again, Humans have finally destroyed Earth and have gone looking for a new home, but outside our solar system, things are much different than they appear. Time and gravity are different concepts in different regions of space, and the effects on the crew, who had hoped to one day see their families again, diminish with each passing day. Matthew McConaughey stars and as is the case with most of his films, he's terrific. Based on some of the poor choices he made in his younger years, he has a bad rep among critics, but the fact is that he's always fun to watch, and is one of the most intense actors out there today. As for the rest of the film, it's usually Nolan's genius that makes the film unique and special, but in this instance he was too smart for his own good. The story moves very slowly and at times is more than somewhat confusing, not to mention at nearly three hours long, it's a challenge to sit through to even reach his famous twist at the end. Nolan films are something I always look forward to, as they are different and both entertain me and make me think, but in this case, I was just beyond bored and fed up with the whole thing. I guess sometimes even genius takes a holiday."
" It's there and it will always been.
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,10,"To start it off this movie will be very confuse and it meant to be confuse from the start and you will start to realize that something does't feel right and it's OK too feel so because that's what the director (Christopher Nolan) want you to feel. The movie is like a puzzle and it unveil itself in a way that when you realize it, your mind will be blown. Murphy law is what drive in this movie, things happen and it will always happen and the time itself will always let it happen cause it will not change no matter what. So to sum this out Copper will always left his daughter no matter what because it will always happen."
" Best movie about space ever,and also best movie for years to come
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,10,"This is the movie every space and physics lovers will really adore.First of all this film makes you go on a journey and it does it in souch way that you won't be moving your eyes from the screen the whole time.Also i have seen in some comments that nobody or at least small amount of people are commenting that this film is a great drama.This movie is so sad,and it makes you feel very different about time,and how it flows,and it makes it in a way for you to realise how much time is a sad thing.We can't escape it but it is the most important thing in life so we have to use it in a best possible way,and enjoy every moment,every hour."
" A Tale Of The Human Spirit
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,10,"""Interstellar"" is a movie about a lot of different things: Exploring the cosmos, family, future stability of planet Earth, time-travel, and science ethics in general. Perhaps most importantly, though, ""Interstellar"" is about something much more important that hasn't been listed yet: the depth of the human spirit.For a basic plot summary, ""Interstellar"" is the story of Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), a farmer in Earth's future. He isn't a farmer by trade, but rather out of necessity, as in this film's future Earth is perilously close to running out of food, and thus all workers (starting even in the school system) are assigned an occupation based on needs rather than wants. At heart, Cooper is an engineer who loves tinkering with things and dreams of ""something bigger"" than the dust-patch he currently resides on. One day, through a chance series of events, Cooper is introduced to Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a fellow dreamer who has concocted a scheme to leave Earth and settle on a new home. The catch? A trip through an intergalactic wormhole is required, which hasn't ever quite been done successfully. So, saddling up with Brand (Anne Hathaway), the professor's daughter, Coop volunteers for the mission, leaving behind his two children, Murph (Mackenzie Foy) and Tom (Timothee Chalamet), to await his promised return.After walking out of the theater upon this film's conclusion, the first thought that struck me was ""Wow...that movie had it all"". I don't know if I've ever seen a film so ambitiously tackle so many areas and yet manage to follow through successfully on all of them. I don't care who you are or where you come from...there is something in this flick that will appeal to you.Usually, I am wary of film's like this, as all too often they ""bite off more than they can chew"" and in trying to tackle everything end up doing nothing completely successful. That all changes, however, with Christopher Nolan behind the camera, backed up by brother Jonathan Nolan writing the screenplay. There hasn't been a thing that the Nolan Bros. have worked on that hasn't been utterly fantastic in both scope and execution. In this case, they reach for the stars (in quite a literal sense!) and get there.""Interstellar"" is also a film I would highly recommended seeing in the largest and clearest possible format. I saw a special showing in IMAX 75mm film, and it was extraordinary. The best part? The visuals are not distractions from the overall plot (again, cue the Nolans here). This isn't a ""look pretty but have little substance"" flick (I'm looking at you, ""Gravity""). The visuals (and even the Hans Zimmer score) perfectly compliment the plot/characters.But this film's brilliance doesn't end with a great story or stunning visuals. Great characters provide the emotional drama of any story, and ""Interstellar"" has those in spades. McConaughey gives perhaps the best performance I've ever seen from him. You'd never know he was once mocked as ""king of the rom-com"". Nolan ""vets"" Caine (""The Prestige"", ""Batman Trilogy"") & Hathaway (Catwoman in ""Dark Knight Rises) also are spot-on in their respective roles. Jessica Chastain (playing a role that I can't discuss much for fear of spoilers!) just continues to build her career that was put in motion by a powerful ""Zero Dark Thirty"" performance. At times, even child actor Foy can steal the show with her emotional range. A true gem of a cast, to say the least.As I mentioned earlier, though, perhaps the greatest feat of ""Interstellar"" is its ability to tell a story that will touch your very spirit. Human beings are, by our very nature, curious beings (being gifted with the most advanced brain of any being found in the universe...at least so far) and thus explorers. The ""Space Race"" of the 1960s fed off that instinct, and Nolan capitalizes on it in this film. While by no means being a ""rah rah"" type of film (every character is very grounded with human faults as well), ""Interstellar"" does strike a chord when it comes to the human spirit and the power it can possess.When the Academy Awards start gearing up later this year, I truly hope that ""Interstellar"" and its cast/crew are richly rewarded for their superb efforts all around. This is easily the most stirring experience I had watching a movie in 2014, and I have a feeling it will last for quite some time as well.So, if you are looking for a movie that sets its scope as high as humanly possible and pretty much obtained the goal, ""Interstellar"" is for you. I could continue to go on and on about the things it did well, but it can also be boiled down to one thing: it will make you FEEL on so many different levels. When was the last time a movie made you care so deeply about the characters/circumstances in such a deep, ""human"" way that you felt like you were right beside them? If it's been awhile since you've seen a movie that fits those requirements, then ""Interstellar"" will be a special treat."
" Mind blowing, makes every space epic look like sh**t
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,9,"Christopher Nolan does it again, the genius director has made a space epic that will define the genre for years to come. The film is deep and complex. There are two major components to every Nolan film. A) the plot b) the characters, normally the plot is Nolan's focus. And he tries to merge the grand scale story line with the characters, to create a intimate feeling with the plot. Such as in this film, Cooper's love for his daughter and the theory of relativity are merged together, as you'll see in the film. Nolan did this with inception, the dark Knight and the prestige. The visuals are mind boggling, instead using green screen and cgi, Nolan chooses to use real sets, unlike most crap today, such as avatar which looked like plastic. Nolan film is a true Masterpiece, and in time will go down with the greats. The critics of course didn't like it, the reason is simple, a) didn't have a political agenda, b)was to complex and clever. These days if it film isn't political or actually has plot is frowned a by the hot shot critics who are as bunch geezer college professors. In short interstellar was amazing, if you want to cry laugh and shout watch it."

",2017-02-27 00:00:00,10,"First of all, i think every movie is almost impossible to be perfect in all ways, it might be rare BUT This movie , how can i say it ,, WOW .. Perfect !!Interstellar almost contains no errors or failures. The Story, the script, sound effects and the cast was something spectacular, i appreciate the good work from the full cast and especially from Nolan, ans also from Hans Zimmer (composer and record producer) ! Highly recommended.The story goes around a drama full of adventure and thrill about some explorers who are engaged in a long journey to discover the space."
" Greatest Movie I have Ever Seen
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,9,"This movie is absolutely amazing. This movie is the kind of movie that makes you want to live a life of wonder and adventure. This movie hits every emotion, from your humor to your soft side, I mean for God sake, it makes you feel sad for a robot. Once I got done watching this movie the first time, I came to IMDb to check the rating and I was honestly upset to see that it only got a 8.6. I have never watched a movie that has made me feel this way. Even watching the second time, even knowing every part, and everything that was going to happen, it made me just love it more and more. The only reason that I am giving this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is because of its complexity of understanding. This is not a movie for someone who does not like to think. Overall, I would recommend this movie 1000 times over. I love this movie and I comment the actors and directors on this wonderful movie."
" Good
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,9,Good idea but bit boring).It was interesting to see how time can flow differently in different parts of the universe. What he knew about the cosmos saw almost a reality. I think one of the best science fiction films. I got a lot of satisfaction.
" The Most Accurate Science Fiction Movie
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,10,"What am I - a big sci-fi fan. What am I not - a scientist. However, I take a very real approach to life, and since the laws of nature are what literally control the sun, the weather and the history of mankind, I've chosen to educate myself. I'm an amateur, of course, but I can comprehend most of the basic principles of physics and math. This movie has been very accurate in terms of what we know for sure and what laws of nature do apply in our galaxy and dimension. My favorite example was the trick with the pen and the paper. We know that this is the way it produces results. Stepping into the unknown, e.g. how the worm hole actually works, this movie went with utilizing the best theories in the field. I was literally crying because I love seeing when someone is taking a scientific approach to solve a problem and is not just relying on a hunch. This was true for the entire movie. I am going to go as far as to claim the book shelf scenes were following the established theories within the movie and it made scientific sense if that's really how gravity and time work."
" Should be titled Star Trek: Interstellar!
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,7,"Due to the legion (apparently!) of cinematic (and televisual) ignoramuses who insist that each successive Nolan movie is a greater masterpiece than the previous one, the more educated viewer is required to treat popular (and no small amount of critical) opinion on Nolan's films with scepticism. 'Interstellar' is a case in point. Cutting to the chase: (a) An artificial wormhole that leads from our part of the Galaxy to the other side is straight out of 'Deep Space Nine'. (b) Love as 'wormhole' connecting us with events in our past; again straight from the premiere of DS9. Arguably, the stunning DS9 episode 'The Visitor' examines this same idea to even greater effect. (c) A more advanced form of life intervening in the development of a less advanced one, possibly due to the former having evolved from the latter: DS9 again. (d) Using 'technobabble' to reduce the 'inertial mass' of a space station so that it can be moved closer to the wormhole: DS9 again. (e) Baseball is Benjamin Sisko's favorite sport; the game features in multiple episodes of the show. Although the baseball breaking the window of the house on the space station wall is a beautiful touch! To be sure, 'Interstellar' doesn't confine its 'borrowing' to 'Star Trek'; the explanation of how a wormhole works is lifted directly from 'Event Horizon'. The ending is reminiscent of the 60s movie 'The Time Machine'. Bottom line: like most sci-fi movies, it's neither startlingly original nor deeply philosophical. In fact, the TV show it 'borrows' so freely from did a far better job of presenting the idea that 'love...transcends time and space' than Nolan does here (Anne Hathaway giving what must surely rank as one of her worst performances ever, to boot). If that example of how the 'great' Christopher Nolan couldn't rise above the directorial standards of a TV show isn't bad enough, the execution of the movie's 'celestial temple' sequence, where Cooper communicates with Murph across time, must surely demonstrate to anyone but the most fanatical Nolanite how poorly Nolan ranks as an employer of visual storytelling; the presentation of multiple instances in the timeline of the room could have, and with a better director would have, allowed the audience to infer that the spiritual connection between Cooper and his loved ones was acting as the 'bridge' between him and Murph without Cooper having to baldly say so! This could have been achieved (and this is only one example!) by presenting more of the room's timeline through shots of the earlier stages in the daughter's life, with her mother as an infant, as a toddler with Cooper and her older brother, etc. Interestingly, for a film that asserts that 'love...transcends time and space', none of the characters have any photographs of their departed loved ones! Of course, maybe Nolan simply underestimates the intelligence of his audience and therefore feels it necessary to 'tell' them what's going on instead of 'showing' them, ironic considering how Nolanites consider themselves to be on a higher intellectual level than the average moviegoer. This movie goes absolutely nowhere that other sci-fi movies or TV shows haven't already gone before."
" Interstellar is Great!
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,10,"Traveling through the depths of space in order to save humanity from going extinct, that's a pretty big deal. Interstellar is an intense film telling the story of leaving Earth on an expedition in search of a new planet to call home for the human race. The 2014 hit movie directed by Christopher Nolan involves a strong cast, mind-blowing cinematics, and a creative and interesting plot. To begin, the movie strikes strongly with an in depth and well thought out plot. Nolan seems to have done his research and gotten reliable and respectable information to back up all of the important scientific aspects to the movie. The plot moves excitingly along, with each scene providing more fascinating information to pile on top. No doubt that a level of intenseness was achieved as you keep getting further and further into the movie. This intenseness provided in the film can give a huge thanks to the epic cinematics and animation used to create an awesome and stunning outer space, as well as the spaceships used, and the planets visited within the movie. The overall development throughout the film is very exciting. Each moment as the movie progresses just gets better, that is if you can sit down and enjoy from beginning to end. Interstellar is almost a whopping three hours long, so you have to have some time on your hands before you take a seat and enjoy this masterpiece. The film keeps you engaged the entire time despite its ridiculous length, which definitely adds to the quality of the film greatly. Now of course the plot, the cinematics, and the overall success of the movie would be nothing if it weren't for the acting crew assembled by Christopher Nolan. The lead character, Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, becomes the pilot for a mission to save humanity. With supporting actors like Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Matt Damon, and many more, the movie capitalized in great acting success, where I felt all roles were played phenomenally. I would not ask for different people to be substituted into their places, they all did excellent jobs. Along with that, there are some flaws with Interstellar, just like in any movie. To start, this film has some originality to it, for example in the exact plot and how events play out, but there are many films with a similar idea to them, such as Armageddon, Gravity, or Avatar. These movies are all relatable in the fact that people are going into space, and also in many of them people are attempting to save Earth from its destruction as well. Also, Christopher Nolan has a lot of the cinematics and detailed aspects that are similar to what these other films have done. With that being said, the movie has its downfalls, but it still remains a masterpiece. Overall, I feel that Interstellar achieved great success in many ways, and the numbers don't lie either. It is considered one of the biggest movies of our time and was very well done by Christopher Nolan. Through all the aspects of what it takes to make a film, Interstellar hit on most to really achieve being an amazing and enjoyable movie. Now not everyone may appreciate this film or feel that it is truly good, but go out and watch it and decide for yourself whether or not Interstellar is a movie for you."
" The masterpiece of our generation
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,10,"First of all I have to say this movie , moved me so much that it basically changed the way I look at life. Its a masterpiece of this century. Nolan wanted to inspire people in this movie and it sure as hell worked on me. If you haven't watched this already be prepared to be moved and when you are done with this emotional and inspiring movie it will feel like you moved through a black hole and survived. 10/10."
" One of the best sci-fi movies ever made despite its pacing.
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,6,"After the success of his Batman trilogy, Christopher Nolan went back to doing original stuff for the first time in a few years after Inception became his highest grossing original film in the USA/Canada. The result? Interstellar, a movie that has to be seen in IMAX and on bluray to enjoy the amazing visual effects and sound mix. The movie runs a bit longer than his last long movie, The Dark Knight Rises, but unlike that movie, there's not a lot of action. Too many lines of dialogue which can be hard to understand, and lack of romance. The music by Hans Zimmer is worth a listen on Spotify, and the robot in the movie is very funny."
" Rivals Casablanca Neck and Neck For My All-Time Favorite Film
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,10,"The packaging of an incredibly well told and unforgettable love story in a science fact/fiction setting. This is Interstellar. I was blown clean away. Five subsequent viewings haven't dulled my enjoyment one tiny iota. While this film has its share of in-context special effects, I thought they kept the focus and flow of the narrative very much alive rather than distracting from it. Pacing is excellent. The unexpected appearance of an acting favorite of mine, was also a surprising treat. Interstellar, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. You are a truly wonderful piece of cinema that should not be missed."
" A Must-Watch!!
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,10,"I usually don't really like sci-fi movies because it obviously doesn't represent reality but it this one I was blown away! The acting and the way the storyline makes a full circle it's amazing and so enjoyable to watch. And the way they explore space theories just kind of brings some reality to this sci-fi, because who knows if those theories may become a fact some day.I really think this is one of those movies that will go down in history as one of the best. It's impossible to not like it, even if you're a sci-fi hater you will find this movie, at least, enjoyable to watch."
" A science fiction movie that is definitely worth watching
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,9,"A great science fiction movie, with an amazing plot and of course a very talented director. No one can deny Nolan's talent, all his movies are well made and Interstellar is one of his best works. Some people say that the plot of Interstellar is confusing but I don't think so (maybe because I've watched this movie more than 20 times). Still we can say that it's a bit confusing if you're watching it for the first time but don't worry it won't be confusing after the second or the third watch.Something that really impressed me in the movie is that when something explodes in space, there is no sound, simply because of the vacuum. In many science fiction movies the audience can hear the sound of explosion, gun fire,etc in space, which makes it look less realistic. But in Interstellar every single thing is physically correct, because Nolan had many consultations with physicists to make the movie realistic.Interstellar has many emotional and dramatic scenes too which makes it different from the other science fiction movies. It shows us the pain of a father who left his kids and went to space to search for a new home for the mankind.Interstellar is an amazing movie and it's definitely worth watching."
" Darn Near PERFECT Sci-Fi Freakout Flick
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,9,"The only reason I don't give this sucker a 10 is because I feel the plot should've spoon fed the viewer more of an explanation of how the foike Cooper went from an alternate reality of his daughter's bedroom inside a Black Hole... ummmmmm, yeah, to back in his ""lander"" outside of the said Black Hole... yeah, really?And remember that he was in an unknown galaxy and needed to go back through that ""Worm Hole"" that he and the full crew entered earlier in the film... yeah right, ummmmmmm, yeah... I guess?So are we to believe that the higher mega powers of the future dimension liquid plasma brain mega data and time keepers did all this for Cooper? Or, was the film getting too long and the Nolen brothers said, screw it, somehow he gets back in the Milky Way near humans in the future on a space colony, and they rescue him?And how did that space chick and her robot build that colony on that place where she's stranded at the end? WTF did they build it with? Did the space station crash down and she scavenged its parts... ummmmm, just asking, alright now? Anyway, it was an amazing journey, and good to see Matt Damon get killed, lol.As to Cooper suiting up and trying to go back in the Worm Hole and find the space chic... well, it was certainly a suicide roll of the dice, unless he had a Hitchhiker's Guide To Worm Hole Navigation manual handy, yeah, that'll do her."
" The power of loving someone or something can only make you a better person
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,10,"What makes this movie a masterpiece is not only the precise science facts that are shown, but also the connection between love and science itself. Love makes us better not only when it corresponds to a human but also when you love something that helps you reveal the best of yourself. Interstellar is about finding yourself when you think you've lost everything, about believing in what you love, about trust and hope. But most important, this film is about risking in the name of love. The elaborated performances and the great cinematic - visual effects (mind-blown and so realistic scenes of outer space) are the proofs of the amazing effort the Nolans put into making this great movie. Such a well deserved Oscar for Best Achievement in Visual Effects. If you appreciate science and are a sci-fi movie lover, WELL here you go. Moreover we all know one thing for sure, Matthew McConaughey never disappoints!"
" Maybe spoilers. I'm still watching it as I type.
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,1,"It could be worse, I suppose. I do appreciate that this is written with science in mind, and with masses of scientific research. Well done there. However, having watched about an hour of watching the film, (and looking at the synopsis here), I have to say, I'm not loving it. The only thing I'm going to enjoy at the end of this is that I can say, ""I've watched it,"" and then the knowledge I never have to watch it again. Don't get me wrong, the science appears to be solid (again, well done, nice to see some one making the effort). But there are a few things that make enjoying this film rather difficult. The constant flash forward of the documentary style memories of earth during this difficult time, and then the flashing back to the...for want of better words ""action"" of the film. I do understand the references to what has happened before the film opens, and well done in the writing, but it's a tad forced, and there are far too many questions that aren't addressed. I think too much is being crammed into the time frame. Having finally watched it, and reached the end I am delighted to say ""I've seen it."" And even more delighted to say ""I never have to watch that again."" There were lots of places that the film could have ended, places that would have made a great deal more sense. There are bits of real science, and then we end up with basically ""some stuff we made up at the last minute."""
" the best and most revolutionizing film I've ever seen
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,10,"24 hours later, and I can't stop contemplating this movie. As I've said, this is probably the best and most revolutionizing film I've ever seen. It really lived up to all its well-deserved hype. An outright masterpiece: brilliant, powerful, thought-provoking. Just like 2001 and Contact, Interstellar is the kind of movie that rightly shows the true essence of science fiction; that it is a prodigious vehicle for ideas ‚Äì ideas that are philosophical, political, psychological and so forth ‚Äì all of which relate to the core significance of human nature. And that is what this epic is all about. It is the search for the definition of humanity ‚Äì what it means to be human, what we are capable of doing and what our place and purpose is in the vast universe. Hopefully this may kindle some public pressure on investing more in space exploration. Reaching for the stars and seeking new frontiers creates the zeal that inspires a new generation to think forward and ensure our progress as a species."
" Masterpiece

We were all very quiet, and after a minute we just looked at each other with that look of ""what did I just witness?""This is in my top 5 favorite films of all time. Every single film that Christopher Nolan directs is stunning and dramatically different from his last production. From the plot to the characters, visuals, cinematography, and the score by Hans Zimmer, this is a storytelling masterpiece. In a world full of CG, it's great that Nolan sticks with the whenever possible."

" Another wow movie
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,2,"Another nearly three hour journey into space and special effects. Humans must travel far to find a plot. I guess the special effects and sound WERE the plot. I was thinking the 8+ rating was because the super creative surprise ending was coming. Nope. It was more like, OK, we are out of worm holes, black holes, dust bowls, docking suspense, tidal waves, and multi-whiteboard formulas, so, let's just use a Southpark ending and....it's gone.My review is supposed to be at least ten lines, because they want my review to take as long as this movie. The movie did have quite a few big names included. So must have had a big budget. I guess I'll check what the box office was. Now I know why I never heard of this movie. What happened to earth anyway? Saving the people on earth was the objective and you never find out what happened, even though the writer had three hours to get to a conclusion. Oh brother..."
" Great Start- Horrible ending
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,6,"Interstellar is without question one of the better films I have seen, however the plot held it back from being what could have been a fantastic movie. Even so, I did enjoy my experience and felt the movie's theme of not giving up hope was nice. Let's get the plot out of the way now seeing how it is my primary gripe with this film. Around 50 years in the future the Earth is faced with worldwide Dust Bowl situation, everything is dyeing and within the next few centuries the Earth won't be able to produce any kind food. At the same time, a worm-hole created by an advanced civilization is created near Saturn, giving humanity a chance to survive. Now it's up to the only living pilot with experience, Cooper (Matthew McConaughey), brilliant scientist Brand (Anne Hathaway), and a few other supporting casts to find a new planet through the worm- hole.Throughout the film, there are multiple deaths that our main characters just completely forget about after they happen. Doyle, one of the 4 people sent on the ship dies on the first planet. A huge deal is made out this, however we never hear anything about him afterward. Same thing goes for Romilly and Dr. Manne. This would make sense if the story took place over a long period of time, however basically no times goes by for Cooper or Brand between the first death and the third. The ending is even worse than the forgotten deaths. We realize humans created the worm-hole, are giving Cooper the keys to save humanity by bending time using gravity and telling Murph the answer she has been looking for. Cooper escapes the black-hole to find himself in the future where Murph saves humanity by creating colonies. We forget about any supporting characters such as Cooper's son, have a touching moment with the almost dead Murph, and immediately think about saving Brand who has been doing who knows what on her planet. I feel if this movie could have been much better with more time. Characters could have reacted towards the deaths of others more and the ending could have been much better.The acting is the one thing that kept me truly interested in this film. McConaughey plays his role fantastically with Hathaway and Chastain following right behind. Their acting is the saving grace of this film. I barely noticed the problems I pointed out with the plot because I was so into the acting.I also enjoyed the theme of the film. The entire story is basically an example of never giving up. If at any given point our characters had stopped, humanity would not have survived. Their perseverance is what saved the human race. You could argue the poem that is constantly repeated is another tool used to push this theme. Lighting is used very well in this film to show the theme. During themes where the characters are about to give up hope, the lighting is slightly darker than normal. At the end where humanity is saved, everything is extremely bright. Fast-forwarding at the beginning of the movie shows that they were successful in the end even though you don't realize until later who is talking. This acts just as proof for the theme.Overall I really enjoyed this film, however I would not recommend it to everyone. The plot would have ruined the film for me if the acting wasn't there to support it. If you want to watch a film that shares the never give up on hope theme, The Shawshank Redemption is a good recommendation."
" Space Junk!
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,1,"This film had been sitting in my 'movie bank' for sometime and I was quite eager to watch it. So, as I do with all films I look forward to, I had my checklist ready: * Bowl of Red Rock Deli Chips - check; * Cold beer - check; * 50"" 4K TV on - check; * Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound on - check; * Movie has elements I enjoy (time travel, black holes, etc - check.OK. Press Play.Thirty minutes into the movie and I have counted five 'WTF!' moments. Two hours into the movie and I have lost count of the 'WTF!' moments. The remaining 30-50 minutes spiraled into a load of laughable nonsense.Folks, this movie is complete rubbish and avoid it at all costs. You are not missing anything if you have not watched it. Do not believe the hype or the ridiculous and over-inflated IMDb score."
" A Masterpiece
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,9,"Describing this film is actually proving to be more than a challenge. The only thing I can think to say is that it was stunning, for lack of a better word. It starts off a bit slow-paced and the plot takes a while to pick up, but when it finally does take off, it really turns into something special. The cinematography is absolutely breath- taking, the plot really hits home, and McConaughey's performance honestly brought tears to my eyes. There's truly so many different reasons as to why this movie worked so well. Hopefully I'm not hyping this one up if I say that Interstellar may very well be one of the greatest science-fiction films of all time."

",2017-01-27 00:00:00,10,"This movie is one of the best movies I've seen on a really long time. I personally like the story of the movie and i actually like the end and I like the characters and how it evolve through the movie. And that's not all, the special effects in this movie are just spectacular, maybe is it because i love space but it is really good.The music in this movie is on another level and it just makes the whole movie much more exciting to watch.If i'm gonna come to an conclusion i would say that's the movie is one of the best and have a cool story that most people probably would like and if you haven't seen the movie already I would strongly recommend it for you."
" Very ambitious film, but it feels like you're in a science test
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"Christopher Nolan has always approached intriguing subject matter in his films. His niche seems to be the 'thinking man's film' and Interstellar is no exception.In this dystopian setting, where mankind is enduring severe blight, Matthew McConaughey stumbles upon a team of NASA scientists and must part from his family to find a suitable planet through a wormhole for the human race to migrate to.When it comes to performance, McConaughey knocks it out of the park. Scenes like watching his family age before him as he sits through 23 years of messages after falling victim to drastic time dilation, it's heartbreaking.The visuals and concepts of this film are absolutely breathtaking. From depictions of wormholes to black holes to five-dimensional tesseracts, this film certainly takes us out of our comfort zones.The downside, unfortunately, is that every character has some preachy, philosophical soliloquy ready to go in each scene. The dialogue, especially when they get into space, is incredibly technical and scientifically specific. Your average punter wouldn't be able to keep up with the equations and probabilities presented here. Sure, they will be stunned by the visuals, but that's about it.Also, the very notion that the fate of humanity is saved thanks to the power of love? Seriously? In a film where they literally got assistance from a renowned astrophysicist, Kip Thorne to help them with scientific accuracy, the chorus of a Huey Lewis song is the solution? That affected my investment in the film big-time.Aside from this, this film is a spectacle to behold. It drags a bit but it's worth it just for the visuals."
" Excellent Movie
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,10,"Knowing the physics behind the movie and understanding the possibilities, when something can achieve the speed of light, this is what made this movie for me. Extremely accurate to real physics and an interesting take on what could possibly be.Overall the movie was produced in an excellent manner and the storyline was great. Many of the plot twists I could speculate about but I was glad when they went one direction or another. You could really connect with the characters when they were trying to contact families and that's something I'm sure many wouldn't even have thought about until you see it from that perspective of someone up in space. I definitely want to watch Interstellar again!"
" Ridiculously far-fetched - even for sci-fi fantasy
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,6,"What a waste. I'm a sci-fi fan and even I give this movie only a ""6.""A lot of talented actors, quality sound & cinematography, but the screenplay really doesn't hold up.In addition to being too far-flung in the number of principal characters, it's too long, and becomes almost comical at times in its plot twists.The movie would have been better served to have: - limit principal characters/stories and provide greater depth for remaining ones - Make the earth-related issues more believableYour time is better spent on a lot of other, higher-quality, sci-fi movies."
" Often impressive and very beautiful, but less than stellar
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,6,"As someone who likes the cast, loved the concept and who considers Christopher Nolan very talented and has enjoyed a good deal of his films, 'Interstellar' was somewhat of a let-down. It has a lot of great elements, but also has its flaws and one admires Nolan more for his ambition than his execution.Starting with the praises, 'Interstellar' does look spectacular. It's majestically shot, seamlessly edited and boasts audacious set design and fantastic special effects. The music score from Hans Zimmer is perhaps his best effort for a Nolan film, it has subtlety but also an unnerving eeriness and haunting and heart-wrenching pathos. The sound effects and sound mixing are expertly managed and give a real sense of authenticity.'Interstellar' however has more than just being technically spectacular. It is thought-provoking and awe-inspiring frequently, with some fascinating ideas, and does have a lot of heart, making the emotional elements genuinely poignant. The Cooper/Murph relationship, which is really what takes centre stage, is beautifully done and often very heartfelt. Nolan directs with great ambition, strong direction of the actors and flawless technical command.Matthew McConaughey proves that his Best Actor Oscar for 'Dallas Buyers Club' wasn't a fluke, he holds everything together in a committed, charismatic and deeply felt turn. MacKenzie Foy matches him beautifully as does Jessica Chastain. Anne Hathaway is sassy and emotive, and there is fine support from John Lithgow and Michael Caine.However, 'Interstellar' is overlong and, because of the wildly variable pacing and that the story doesn't quite have enough content to justify it, it feels it. The pacing is wildly variable as aforementioned, there are times where it's fine but there's some choppiness and stodginess too.Dialogue isn't a strong suit either, there are many times where it's thought-provoking and poignant, but too much of it also consists of confused and at times illogical science (the time and space stuff was convoluted sometimes), forced sentiment and things being over-explained and preachy. Matt Damon's character felt thrown in and not particularly necessary, also somewhat silly, while the ending is far too idealistic and too falsely pat.Overall, less than stellar and was expecting much better. This said, 'Interstellar' is often impressive and very beautiful (especially technically, though the central relationship was also beautifully realised). 6/10 Bethany Cox"
" Could have been a masterpiece if it had a better ending
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,7,"Christopher Nolan's most recent film is an epic adventure in space filled with science and philosophy as the characters go into an interstellar expedition in order to save humanity. It is I think the British director's most mature work and it could have been his best picture if not for its disappointing ending. One can't avoid drawing comparison to Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey (one of Christopher Nolan's favourite films). Interstellar is indeed an odyssey of its own, but it ultimately fails where 2001 succeeds.Before I talk about the ending, I want to comment on how good the rest of the film was. It was amazing! Everything about it was a masterpiece: the visual effects, the score, the imagery, the story, everything. Most of all though, the dialogues. As I mentioned above the film also gets philosophical at times amidst the so well-researched scientific script. You listen to the astronauts talking about supermassive black holes and the next moment they discuss about love being a total mystery that overcomes the barriers of space and time. It was much more though-provoking than I expected. The idea alone that a time may come when earth won't have the necessary ingredients to sustain human life is terribly frightening. The main theme of the film I think is survival and how far people are determined to go in order to survive. What would you do if you have to choose between the people you love and the preservation of the human kind? I hope we never come to face this dilemma.And then comes the the ending. This is where everything goes wrong. We discover that the ghost and these 5-dimension beings are actually future humans who have evolved into much more powerful beings and allow for Cooper to send messages in the past to help the people of his age. Then, we learn that Murph and her team managed to create a station that can travel in space and save a lot of people, Cooper somehow is transferred there from the black hole and Brand starts a new human colony in the third planet. All this carefully taken care of scientific background becomes something closer to fantasy. First of all there's the predestination paradox we so often come across in sci-fi movies. How did future humans survive if they needed Cooper to send these messages to NASA? And even if there is an explanation for that as some people claim, why didn't future humans make things a bit easier? They could travel through time and they supposedly created the wormhole that made the whole plan possible. Couldn't they create a wormhole next to the earth so that everyone could be saved? Couldn't they inform people about the best possible planet? And if NASA created a station in space that could sustain life for thousands of people, couldn't it do the same in the Earth saving many more? Maybe Christopher Nolan just wanted a happy ending. Maybe he wanted to satisfy people who didn't care much about science. For me, the last minutes only managed to ruin my impression of the previous 2 hours.In any case Interstellar is a great and very engaging film and its technical aspects are amazing. The ending made the plot seem a bit faulty, but this doesn't make it a bad film. In fact I would recommend it to everyone. You never know, maybe there is a pretty good and scientific explanation for everything and I'm completely wrong. Maybe this is why 2001 is better. Kubrick knew which answers he could answer and which he could not. So instead of coming up with some out-of- place explanations about the monolith and evolution, he just leaves everything open for interpretation letting the movie speak for itself. I wish Interstellar did the same.More reviews at https://reflectingoncinemablog.wordpress.com"
" Noble, visually memorable, clunky and hardly stellar but passable.
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,7,"There is no question that Interstellar is the kind of over ambitious movie that will polarize audiences, but I'll give it credit where it is do.A strong first act is followed by a clumsy and dull second act followed by a climax which is enough of a mind-f**k to partially re-engage you. This is a medium good film, but far from a great one.As far as the cast goes, Interstellar gets fair performances out of Matthew Mcconaughey and John Lithgow. Jessica Chastain is also strong yet strangely distant. Anne Hathoway meanwhile leaves us in the cold. She is as bland as she was in Dark Knight Rises. Nolan as a writer continues to have trouble delivering strong female characters.The dialogue is not the film's strong suit. It is heavy on scientific jargon and forced sentiment and unless you are watching the film with surround sound, almost half the conversation is inaudible. Hanz Zimmer delivers a distinctive score but one that is so overbearing that whole lines of script get lost behind it.The scenes in space are filmed quite admirably. This is movie where you get lost in the cosmos rather than admiring of the CGI quality. Special effects are not meant to be the star of the show. Interstellar sends its characters to planets that resemble real landscapes on Earth, and it doesn't need to dress them up or add flair to make you feel like you are light years from home.I cannot say that Interstellar is not an endurance test, because it is. Though not as exhausting as say the last half of Return of the King, Interstellar is burdened by a very dull middle section with questionable editing decisions and a waste of Matt Damon. The Climax is highly cerebral but might leave you annoyed depending on how hard you try to deconstruct it.The films heart is in the right place. It is an ambitious film with some unforgettable scenes, but it won't age as well as Nolan Batman trilogy, and is an acquired taste that won't be for everyone."
" Pretentious
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,3,"Rather disappointed in that movie. As with many new Sci-fi, the viewer in drown in a sea of special effect to cover a poor story line. This movie is crafted in pure scientist hubris, and is a lengthy attempt at explaining how humanity would self explain itself. In front a the great mystery of the meaning and origin of life, some people seems unable to accept that a few things might transcend us and would rather explain everything by our future genius and awesomeness...Because there is no limit to what we will be, right? It is like 2001 Space Odyssey: massively overrated. The intellectual dilemma of the story is whether humanity is to be seen as a collection of individuals, or as a species, and the answer seems to be that we would be maybe our creator and self little helpers. Humanity as a stepping ladder to itself, out of darkness and non existence. Rather sad..."
" Another bloated, overrated space epic
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,4,"Another outer space film from Hollywood, this time directed by INCEPTION's Christopher Nolan. Thankfully it's better than the overrated GRAVITY, but INTERSTELLAR soon turns out to be overrated in turn. It seems that as soon as a film comes out these days with a half intelligent premise, critics and audiences lap it up and rate it as one of the best ever. INTERSTELLAR is far from that. It has plenty of interesting moments, but the overlong running time is padded and bloated with endless sentimentalism and extraneous characters.It also takes a heck of a lot of time for anything to actually happen. Matthew McConaughey is all earnestness as the protagonist and comes across as a dullard; Anne Hathaway's character is completely extraneous and lacking in charisma. Only old timers like John Lithgow and Michael Caine shine, although Wes Bentley is underutilised in his role. An unexpected appearance from Matt Damon is undoubtedly the story's highlight.For much of the running time this follows the template of a typical space adventure, but around the middle part of the film it starts to get weighed down with endless CGI effects and the whole end part of the production gets muddled and predictable in equal measure, coming across like a rip off of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY but not nearly as good."
" So many things that make this a great movie
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,10,"I've never even thought about answering the question: What is the best movie ever? There just wasn't anything triggering to think about that question even though I've seen a large number of movies. After seeing Interstellar it struck me: This is the best movie I have ever seen. Hands down. I actually had to register to IMDb just for this movie review. Give credit when credit is due is one of the principles I live by. The many beautiful, heartbreaking human relationship subplots. The wonderful acting. The absolutely stunning score. The at this moment theoretical science that could explain almost all of the science parts in the movie (even if they are still just theories). I used hours to study the science behind this movie after seeing it. The despair. I just loved it all. The only thing I am biased with, is that I like the element despair in movies. There is nothing I can think of, that could have been better or anything that annoyed me during the movie. These are the reasons I give it a 10. Interstellar is an absolutely beautiful movie that has so much more going on aside from the main plot. Nothing I've seen comes close. Enjoy the ride."
" Great Movie
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,8,"This movie is on my top list for sure. The movie may seem a bit confusing or slow at some parts, but it all adds up in the end. I loved the twists, and did not see the end coming. It was just all around intense, intriguing and emotional. The actors did such a great job portraying their characters, at times I felt like this was a true story line. Some of the effects were not all that impressive but overall I thought the directional staff did a good job of keeping the plot moving in the right direction. This is without a doubt a must see movie. I recommended this to family, friends, everyone... I'm glad I watched it and would surely watch it again. It is hard for me to find a movie now a days that I don't feel was a waste of time but this movie was not that. You will enjoy it!"
" Boring, clich√©s, plot holes
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,2,"Lots of beautiful visuals to look at, but a completely unbelievable story line including just about every clich√© you can think of: - Just before the film started, we were talking about how many movies started with a hero that has some kids in a distressed situation as it seems like this is a must nowadays to add emotional depth to the hero. Within minutes, this film starts with the hero whose wife died of cancer so he now has to raise the kids. - A drone from India flies over, hero grabs his laptop and takes over command of the drone in seconds. Sure. - All of this while driving full speed straight through a corn field, without the slightest bump. Sure. - The wind blows some dust into a room. Hero stares at is, understands it is a binary code of the coordinates of a top secret Nasa base. - Upon entering the base, he meets the beautiful and smart daughter of the professor. Of course that becomes the predictable love affair, but of course she is first difficult to get and of course the hero first has to save her life at least once. - They blow up half of their space station with an enormous explosion, but no problem, just continue flying with the other half. - Earth needs to manipulate gravity to save humanity. No problem, just fly through a black hole and you will automatically gain any knowledge needed. - But wait, they still have to transfer that knowledge to Earth. The only way to do that is to have the hands of an old watch sway up and down in a Morse code because that watch has a love connection to hero's daughter. And with love you can do what all your technology cannot. (Here goes all your respect for this film using believable technology.) - After years in space, the hero is saved with just a few minutes oxygen left.Altogether it seems that Nolan fans have pumped up the score of this film far beyond a reasonable score."
" I presume that I haven't given away any spoilers here, but still, try to reckon the spoilers (if any).
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"Well, Interstellar is a beautifully crafted movie that has the mixture of science, human emotions, absolutely fine acting. I would like to say that the wonderful photography and the performances will have an impact on you. This movie takes you through many emotions and is actually pretty smooth. The screenplay is amazing and the thing I loved about the movie is that it keeps human emotions intact even though dealing with a generally strong science fiction base. The actors have performed phenomenal and the climax, especially will blow your mind. The ending scenes will make you emotional and the dialogues are well written. So, all in all, I would like to conclude by typing that this is one of the good quality movies and I hope I did not give away any spoilers in my review!"
" Mayn! Christopher how can you do that?
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,9,"The movie I was searching for last 4 years.. I always questioned teacher where do we implicate all the concept we study and Christopher did that. Man! He is so great he always make something new which hallucinates our mind great work dude. The movie which gives a practical applications of Newton's law of gravitation, Einstein theory of relativity the actual concept of space and time and the truth of gravity. Though the concept of world after black seems to be quite grumbling. Anyways no one can make such a movie ever. Sir Christopher Nolan no one can ever compete you. Mind blowing. IMDb : 9. The reason for that it interferes the concept of Allah and ""they"" and nothing much I suggest everyone to watch this movie"
" Nice scenario but boring film
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,5,"It was so boring! It was 3 hours long and nothing was interesting....... Do not bother watching it. You will be disappointed!!!!!!!!! In the end it was kind of interesting,but to get to the end u had to get through 2 hours of really boring content..... The scenario though makes sense and was new. I liked the space theme,but the fact that it was so boring made me despise this movie in general.... In conclusion it is a pretty bad movie, boring ,uninteresting and I will NEVER watch it again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!In my opinion you shouldn't see it either. It is a waste of time. I hope you take this review seriously and not rage with it!"
" Intergalactical overrated clich√© movie, with excellent graphics.
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,5,"Unfortunately, Interstellar in another Sci-Fi movie that failed to make a consistent clever scenario with good scientific related dialogues that make sense and do not try to impress the audience with wambly bubbly magical solutions and unreal metaphysics. The dialogues are stupid as hell, the events are complete unrealistic and unclever (and unoriginal). The idea and the graphic are very good but as I pointed before this movie suffers from the Pop Sci-Fi syndrome plus the need of Hollywood to have a protagonist-hero style-ultra soldier patriot who stupidly takes the solution to himself (like the scene who rides the spaceship without the auto-pilot or the fact the NASA put his hope into a guy who just showed up in his secret door etc...). Everything around Matthew McConaughey it's so boring clich√© and shallow for such a budget movie.The 5/10 is a reflection of a nice idea plus the work of the CGI and the physicists who worked to make the simulations for the ultra-realist black holes."
" One of the best movies I have ever seen!
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Interstellar was amazing. It drags you through an emotional dramatic well thought out story and I honestly don't understand how anyone could not like this movie!?!? I read a lot of reviews saying it was ""unrealistic"" and ""stupid"" but it's a movie! Who cares?!? Nobody says Harry Potter is ""unrealistic""! Interstellar is believable enough. Every time I hear the theme song I find myself in tears. It's not your average American space movie (like gravity) it's so so much more. You feel so many things, one minute you have an existential crisis and the next you're crying and then you're laughing and hfuiewhfruiewhuehehghfiowghewuigheiowghrie. The acting was amazing! I hated Matthew McConaughey before and now it's quite the opposite. WORDS FAIL TO DESCRIBE HOW WONDERFUL THIS MOVIE IS!!!!"
" Best sci-fi movie in years
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"I almost never find movies, that I find worthy of a review, however, I am in a situation in life, where I find joy in very very few things, being a paranoid, drug-abuser, who lost EVERYTHING in the course of 6 months (Family, car, apartment, girlfriend) being a patient at a psycich ward, I found this movie so touching that I had to praise it.Matthew McConaughey, Mackenzie Foy, Michael Caine and Anne Hatthaway, all performed, so intriguingly and masterfull, that I was wept in tears throughout the unravelling of the movie.I mostly enjoy sci-fi movies like, Star trek and AvP movies, I just want to tell you, this is worth watching, even if you're not into non action movies.A true masterpiece and the best Sci-fi movie I have watched for several years!"
" Yaaaaaaawwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnn for nearly 3 hours.
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,1,"Yaaaaaaawwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnn for nearly 3 hours.I put this on in the background and found lot's of other interesting things to do. (Call my daughter), tidy up my emails, cut my nails, Facebook. After a lot of fast forwarding, I gave up 90 minutes into it.Chasing a drone that is nothing like a drone and taking control of it (like that was realistic) what looks like an Atlas rocket on the outside is extremely spacious on the inside. Robbie the robot is made of boxes covered in mirrored fablon (look up seventies material for reviving old furniture). This film is disappointing in every aspect. Unrealistic, poor visualisations, drawn out subject, don't waste 3 hours of your valuable time on it. I've taken 15 minutes out of mine to save you."
