" GREAT BUT WITH RESERVATIONS
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,6,"Firstly, it's Iko Uwais, so you should know it's already an exciting film. The only problem was that the story had a big disconnect. One set of characters are out for blood while the others are being emotional and confused. Great key moments are misused and for action scenes it could have made it an even better film. All in all, 6 out of 10. In my opinion, a decent lazy afternoon watch."
" Direction Could Be Better.
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,6,"As always action was awesome.I watched the movie just for action.After watching his raid and raid 2 movie.I became a fan of his action.The story is good an average level story.But the actions was fascinating.But what the movie lack is acting and direction.Acting was ok but direction could be better.Anyway,If you are an action lover just go for it.I hope it wont disappoint you."
" Absurd, but..
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,6,"Mindlessly entertaining. Had no idea what to expect, and I'm not usually a big fan of karate movies, but this had enough gore to keep me interested, and the action, even though absurd, is fun to watch. Yeah, the participants do the usual stupid stuff like letting an opponent off the hook easily, or turning their backs at the most inappropriate time, or giving up the gun to use bare hands, but the action is frequent and fast-paced, and it never gets boring. Recommend if you are looking for lite entertainment."
" Headshots you with predictability
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,4,"Another entry for the Indonesian martial arts genre. Predictable, to say the least.After waking up from a 2 months coma, now-called Ishmael tries to restart his life but his past puts everything at stake.Nothing to see here, honestly. It's the expected recipe: gory kung-fu-ish action.We see some recurring faces here. Uwais. Estelle. If you like watching this genre, those are familiar.The plot is very shallow and epic-like. Nothing intriguing or anything. You only need to put your head on it for some minutes and you know what is going on. Actually, the movie just flat out exposes himself very soon in the storyline. With that in mind, watch it brainless.I get the movie title but it is so redundant...Not for everyone. Below average to fans of the genre, I would say."
" ""You can write Ishmael""
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,7,"'Headshot' is notable for being the first Iko Uwais vehicle after the two 'The Raid' movies. With those, he was established as a major new action hero for the Far East and the pressure must have been on to keep the momentum going. If there was any temptation to make a less violent flick and increase the potential audience though, it doesn't show. 'Headshot' is brutal, matching 'The Raid' in intensity and only surpassed by the frankly insane 'The Night Comes For Us.' This is a martial arts movie that sees bones being splintered, glass bottles and knives being used as weapons and human bodies contorting as they're riddled with bullets.The story sees Iko washed up on a beach and close to death. After spending two months in a coma, he wakes with no memory of who he is or how he got there. His doctor christens him ""Ishmael"" and he sets out trying to find out who he is. But the people who hurt him find out he's alive and come looking. He's barely begun to piece his life together before he has to fight for it.And fight, he does. Ishmael might not remember any of his previous life but like Jason Bourne before him, he's very good at defending himself. As the gangs hunt him down, Ishmael finds himself in the centre of a Police station massacre, a vicious close-quarters fight on a bus and some wince-inducing punch ups in an underground bunker. It's unpleasant, vicious stuff and horribly authentic. Aside from the fact that Ishmael shrugs off multiple knife wounds and is borderline indestructible, when the characters in this movie hit each other, it looks like it really, really hurts.All of which makes for an enjoyable two hours for action fans. 'Headshot' isn't a cerebral movie; the plot is only wafer thin and it serves as no more than a vehicle for Uwais to dispatch bad guys in increasingly violent ways. It gets by on pure adrenaline and while it does suffer from the final act being marginally less intense than you'd hope, it still ticks all the boxes for a good ""beer and pizza"" Friday night movie."
" Head Ache
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,5,"We've seen this before. A brutal gang boss who picks up kids from the street making them killers. One of them turns renegade and wrecks revenge. What works is the lead actor who's earned his chops in brutal action thrillers.
What doesn't is everything else. There's no back story, no character development. Best avoided"
" Apalling dont waste your time!
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,2,"A very very bad movie without any real story line, movie was just annoying with sensless killings."
" Still not as good as the Raid
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,3,"Indonesian movies try so hard to replicate the success of The Raid, but fail everytime. They go overkill with violence (although is one is much less over the top than The night comes for us).But still, it lacks pace. Most of the fights were average and surprisingly unoriginal, from this talented team.I haven't much to say about it. I loved the Raid but I found Headshot kinda boring. Story already seen multiple times.I wish those talented indonesian filmakers keep the pacing and action from the Raid, and inject a little more plot into it"
" Everything you'd want and expect
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,8,"Decent enough storyline with close to perfect fight and action scenes by the bucketload and on a whole actors quite capable of acting no wooden robots here. It's not completely perfect as it's far from complex but if you want high paced, high octane fun on an extremely violent scale you'll more than get your fix here."
" Not right in the head
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,7,"I guess there is some social commentary here, but this is rather in the background and no serious conversation about it is necessary. What you can expect is a lot of action, a lot of shoutouts and a lot of stunts in general. Don't count on ""reality"" being a part of this. Which you should expect more or less but is quite annoying when it comes to powerful rifles and their lack of ""impact"" or rather lack of penetration power ... ah well, you have to suspend your disbelief, who'd have thunk it? Almost everyone watching I reckon.Having said all that Iko does a really good job and the fight choreography is quite stunning. Do not expect much of a story, and there is a lack of ""comedy"" elements, but that probably would have been weird anyways ... if this sounds like your cup of tea - go ahead and watch, you know what to expect"
" Great Ambience
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,7,"The biggest strength of this movie is its ambience. Coupled with entertaining martial art shows, nice twist in the plot, it is a good movie. But I'm afraid that's all, nothing very special about it. Maybe because we have seen Iko Uwais in much better movies with much better martial art shows, better plot and more interesting twists. And maybe Chelsea Islan wasn't developed enough to make this movie extraordinary. Maybe."
" If you like bourne...
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,8,Indonesian jason bourne movie. Thats all i got to say. The end
" Great action, cool story

" Bourne Again in Asia
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,5,"Shot through the head, and they're to blame; darlin', you give Bourne a bad name.Ever since The Raid, I've been a huge Iko Uwais fan, but sadly, nothing's ever lived up to my first impression. This one, while oodles better than that awful Mile 22, and the second Raid are near the bottom of his filmography.And yet, it's not that bad. If you like martial arts, incredible amounts of gore and bad guys who went to the Stormtrooper School for Shooting, this might be for you. But, plan ahead. This is way too long at 2 hours and many times you'll feel the pain of the length like the agony our hero also feels.Basically, it's the Bourne synopsis. An amnesiac learns slowly of his bad past while discovering he has fantastic fighting skills. Will he return to his dark days or try to put an end to it and slip away with the Florence Nightingale who's obsessed with him?Can't really blame her. I don't just love his fighting skills, he's one of the best-looking actors, ah-hem, men I've ever seen. So, I know how she feels.If it weren't so long, so slow in many spots and so much like Bourne, I'd rate it higher. Also, while you have to suspend your disbelief for this amount of abuse taken during fights, I could never get past how many times guns go off right by the ear and no one seems to be bothered by that. It's like being shot in the eye and the hero just wipes away the blood so he can see better.Eh, I still recommend it, especially for free on Netflix.***Final thoughts: And speaking of which... It's kinda sad his movies make so little money. It looks like he puts a TON of effort into making these fun action films. I guess he can always brag about how much Star Wars Episode VII made, but I doubt he can take too much credit for that."
" Disappointing movie, subpar action and plotholes everywhere
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,4,"I loved Iko Uwais in The Raid and Merantau. I saw the good reviews for this movie and wanted to give it a shot. What a disappointment!The movie tries to be deep : using Moby Dick references, calling him ""Ishmael"", but fails as it barely stays on the surface. Second, there are too many inconsistencies : the female doctor is too young, never works, sleeps in her patient's room, etc.We never know WHY she has to go to Jakarta. Also it's never explained WHY the protagonist is shot in the head. We get flashbacks but it's never cleared out.
There's one guy who speaks English, zero reason why. Everybody speaks Indonesian but him.Now the action : poorly overly choreographed action scenes, with some hits that should have killed the protagonist 100 times yet he stands up and fights again. I'm talking about some guy getting shot, stabbed, slashed multiple times, doesn't seem to know how to fight in one scene, knows kung-fu in another scene, gets a gun, but tosses it, picks another gun, doesn't shoot it, but tries to hit someone with it like a bat...Also, I know they try to make a strong tough female character but oh my, such a failure. I'm supposed to believe a 100 lb woman with a knife can out-power guys with guns? Also that girl uses an enemy as a human shield against an AK and doesn't get a single bullet hitting her? Wtf was thatThe story is mediocre. Those comparing to Jason Bourne, you know they are not honest. Save your money, save your time. Watch The Raid again."
" Thinnest scenario and horrible camera work
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,5,":(
When you can feel the director walking with his camera during fights... very bad"
" This Indonesian martial arts action film is a great surprise
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,10,"It tells the story of the crime lord of an Indonesian island who abducted young children and turned them into killing machines. Decades later, the survivors who have become ruthless hitmen shoot Abdi/Ishmael down because he wanted to become a human being and live a normal life. They left him for dead in the sea, but an old angler rescues him and brings him to the local hospital, where he stays in a coma for two months. Upon waking, he gets acquainted and falls in love with Ailin, the doctor who looked after him. They plan to reunite later in Jakarta, but the hitmen are already tracking them down. Ailin and a little girl are the only survivors when the mafia attacks the bus going to the capital city, and there starts Ishmael's trail of tears and blood again, which will lead him to the moment of truth."
" my notes
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,3,"Not good. at one point i was only watching for the fight scenes. everything else was pretty useless and boring. i compare this to the raid series because it has the same lead actor and some others from those movies. it tried to copy it in a few ways but is inferior in every way. some of the fight scenes were great, fast-paced and hard-hitting. but some was just okay. and there was a LOT of stupid stuff and extremely questionable decision-making by the characters. so many things made no sense, not with regards to the story, but with how the fight scenes happened. and i love seeing violence with purpose in a movie, but some of the violence seemed to be there just for the sake of being violent, and overly violent (1 viewing)"
" Iko Uwais delivers again, but that's no surprise.
",2019-07-08 00:00:00,8,"Iko Uwais is amazing. If you've seen him in other movies, you already know this and don't need me to try to sell you on this one.This movie is pretty much non stop action, with some scenes being very brutal and even a little difficult to watch. (I'm generally not the one to look away, unless it's something like *that* scene from ""American History X"".) The choreography is beautiful to watch and I found myself rewinding and rewatching multiple scenes several times. I really, really liked the way the movie was shot as well, from fast to slow motion, to many different angles used.The rest of the major characters were also great, with Very Tri Yulisman really blowing me away.Sure, the movie is maybe a little predictable, but there's still a good story there - much better than I expected for this type of movie. There's also just enough of drama and romance to add substance, without being cheesy or annoying. (We're here for the action, after all. If we want romance, we'll go watch ""The Notebook"" or ""La La Land"" - both of which are great movies, BTW.)Some of my favorite scenes are around the 29m, 1h11m, and 1h42m marks.Just do yourself a favor and watch this movie. :)"
" Headshot
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,9,Iko uwais is the best martial artist in the world. This is the best action in 2016.
" Sleeper Cult Classic
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,9,"While having your fill of the classic Jackie Chan and Jet Li martial arts fests from the 90's can be pleasing for genre nerds, this sleeper cult classic delivers on all levels. The plot is complex and nuanced (as much as possible for this style of cinema) and the editing helps keep up the pace. The main takeaway here is the incredible action choreography. Perfectly choreographed fight sequences happen at a blinding pace with enough classic marital art tropes to keep the purists happy while also providing a new, fresh zing to engage the uninitiated. There is incredible attention to detail in the choreography and every single sequence shines. There is not one dull moment here.Iko Uwais really comes into his own here. You might have seen him in The Raid movies, enjoyed his cameo in The Man of Tai Chi, or had good fun watching his slow burn performance in Mile 22. However, this is his magnum opus. Supported by an excellent cast, Iko really pours in all of himself here, choreographing and executing action sequences that would be fresh and exciting decades from now. The chaos builds up fast into an excellent climax that serves the narrative well and puts the stamp of marital arts superstardom on Iko. It will be exciting to see his future work.Whether you are a marital arts cinema nerd or a newcomer to the genre, this is a must watch."
" Masterpiece
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,10,"Best directors when it is about fighting. Very nice cinematography, lightning, acting. Only bad part was the unrealistic shotgun kill throuh the table. a Body would never fly lime this. :D i also like the other movies like the raid, the night comes for us"
" Can you please add MOREcamera shake?
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,3,"This had potential, and being a fan of raid1&2... but the fight scenes are just rendered unwatcheable duetothe over abuse of post production camera shake added.It looks like the cam op was Hungover with the withdrawl shakes + 6 coffeesAnd fyi..

" Just for the hell of it!
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,9,"I'm not sure if it's as good as the 'Raid' movies and as you expect so much, it can be a bit disappointing in places. Kind of like the Tony Jaa pictures, it's increasingly difficult to top former films, especially when you start to age. The same will go for Iko Uwais and these incredibly hot Indonesian, action movies. I mean where do you go after this and how do they raise the bar, any further? Despite the great action, the plot did seem to wonder a little. Also I did not care for the sentimental ending, though it does not distract from the graphic violence we all love to watch."
" Very predictable, story makes no logical sense.
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,5,"But for the fights it gets 5 stars. Some great martial arts and somewhat gore-y weapons combat, tho i didnt find it as much ofa gore fest as others here by any means.. The blood was mostly done with cheap effects and didnt look real. The face cave ins and things like that were the only bloody realistic scenes to some degree.
Love the cast but the acting was sub par. They needed better directing i guess since i know many of them are capable of much better. I've seen a quite a few Indonesian martial arts films now, and this one is a easy skip. Only watch this is you've seen everything else and need some mindless fluff i guess... Or just rewatch one of the better ones out there instead."
" Save your Popcorn!
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,2,"This is sooooo bad that KNOW those good reviews were paid for! Others have compared this turkey to Jason Bourne. Jason has a plot, fantastic fight scene and great acting (remember Matt's portrayal of the almost boyish soldier with a killer jock inside him?). The acting in this sloppy cheez serving is wack, the big shot baddies in their terrible suits and cliche sneers... if you gonna go corny at least camp it up like in those macho fun spaghetti westerns. The sound track music sounded like it was taken off a KTV machine and cut and pasted all over the place. As for the plot, it's impossible to write a spoilter about it coz everything is that obvious.
At least in the RAID movies, which led me to watch this turkey, it was straight up and simple serving of ass kickings so you could go to the fridge come back with the six pack and not need to ask 'so what I miss?'.
We do salute the Child Trafficking subtext to this movie though, something that's huge in Indonesia (well the whole region really) , this is not really fleshed out, probably because it would be too unpalatable for viewers... unlike the shootings, stabbings, eye gouging, bone breaking close ups we see throughout this 2 Star Special."
" Senseless story.
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,1,"1.Its a waste of time to watch It.
2.The action scenes are too bad, made me to wish that Hero should be dead.
3.WTF no bullets could touch the hero.
4.Too much fight scene but hero survived all of it
5.i think he was taking some kind of energy drink all the time."
" More enjoyable than The Night Comes For Us
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,7,"HeadshotAfter being rather impressed by the fight choreography and direction of Timo Tjahanto's movie The Night Comes For Us, I decided to check out an earlier collaboration with this director and martial arts star Iko Uwais.
Headshot is a film that tries to raise the bar set by films such as The Raid and The Raid 2.Headshot is a movie about a man (Iko Uwais) who washes up on a beach with a bullet hole in his head.
Nursed back to health by a Doctor named Ailin played by Chelsea Islan, the man has no recollection of who he is or how he ended up on that beach.
This film takes its time in telling its story.
When the action does ignite it is handled masterfully.
Uwais's character who is named Ismael by the Doctor learns through the course of the movie that he is part of a gang led by the viscous Lee played with delight by Sunny Pang.
A man responsible for taking young children and cruelly nurturing them into killers.
When Ishmael learns this he decides that this isn't the life for him now and he must now fight to be free.Unlike The Night Comes For Us, the gore in this movie isn't as over the top.
It is utilised effectively.
Fight scenes are let play out through long wide shots so we the audience can relish every single moment.
Perhaps not as inventive or as intense as the choreography in The Night Comes For Us, Headshot is less fatiguing to watch.
I actually found the plot to be a little more fluid and as a movie from a storytelling aspect superior to director and actors latter collaboration.
Performances are much better too. Uwais and Islan have a believable chemistry and Sunny Pang plays a great villain.Headshot is actually co-directed by Kimo Stamboel.
Not always the case then that two heads are better than one!
This because in terms of the action many will probably be in favour of The Night Comes For Us.
Not me, I'm with Headshot but only by a whisker.
Both movies are superior action movies and put he work being produced by Hollywood to shame.
I think Headshot is the more favourable movie because it isn't as frenetic as The Night Comes For Us.
In terms of raising that bar up from The Raid movies it doesn't accomplish this but it's still a fine action movie."
" Great action flick
",2018-10-25 00:00:00,8,"Great action, quite bloody though. Lead actors did an excellent job."
" It isn't a movie
",2018-10-25 00:00:00,3,"Less story information, a lot a part doesn't in the right right place, and some scene and the story can be improved. But the director looks like lazy to think. Go go indonesian move"
" Fails to deliver on what the viewer wanted most: satisfying action
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,5,"Like many people here, I got excited for this movie because of The Raid I and II. The action sequences there were, as many people pointed out, exceptional and left your heart pumping and adrenaline rushing through your body. They were fun movies to watch. The Raid II developed more backstory and thus dragged on a bit more, but I have happily sat through this because I felt it added something to the experience. All of a sudden we cared about the characters on the screen, they weren't just fighting machines; they had character.Headshot failed to deliver on a lot of levels, but most importantly it fails on the action. The use of slow motion during action scenes was insanely distracting and even pointed out glaring mistakes (like the fact that that guys baton wiggled an awful lot like a plastic one). It subtracted from any realism from the movie. And can we talk about the FORCED love plot between the two main characters? They introduced the doctor and all I could think was ""who is she and why does she love him?"" It's apparent from the setting that she ""met"" him while in a coma. And we're supposed to buy the fact that she fell in love with him while he was in a coma? AND THAT HE FELL IN LOVE WITH HER IMMEDIATELY AFTER WAKING UP FROM SAID COMA??? Honestly I wasn't expecting this movie to have a stellar plot, but when the plot is distracting from the movie it makes the action scenes less enjoyable.Also, outside of the fact the action scenes were distractingly shaky, the whole time I felt that our main character felt held back (maybe that should be the title of the movie). What made The Raid I and II exciting was the fact that the main character wasn't held back; he as a badass and was able to be a badass the whole movie. During Headshot, because he was recovering from his memories, you never felt like he was really fighting at 100%. During all the fight scenes I kept shouting ""c'mon actually fight this guy."" Not because he was listening to what I was saying, but because I was getting more and more frustrated at how much he held back. I know at this point I'm repeating myself, but it was so incredibly infuriating watching this guy I know could beat up anyone who fights him (because canon I guess) look as though he was trying to figure out why he was fighting in the first place. Hand to hand action scenes are not the place for exposition.Finally, our main character suffers from ""I can never die no matter what people do to me"" syndrome. Despite getting stabbed, punched, kicked, headbutted, smashed into a wall, and SHOT, he cant die. And because if he did, that would be the end of the movie. You can't build suspense if I already know the main character can't die. Now I know people are going to say ""well he kinda had the same thing in the Raid I and II"" and you're right. But at the end of the day, those were better movies. And because of that, you just ignore it. But in this movie, fueled by slow motion shots, it's blatantly obvious that he just can't die. The scene on the beach was too much. And that's after he was attacked by a guy with a ""metal"" baton for 8 minutes. It just removed me from the movie so much that I couldn't enjoy it.Conclusion (for those of you who made it this far): if you're looking for a mindless action movie and haven't seen this one, watch it. But then go watch The Raid movies and see for yourself why they're better movies. This movie was frustrating and as a result I constantly felt removed from fully enjoying it. It deserves a 5 star rating because there were some pretty b-roll shots, and the choreography was spectacular (but poorly shot and directed). A disappointing movie to say the least."
" Nice shot but it's not good enough
",2018-03-30 00:00:00,6,"The movie follows our protagonist after washed on the shore dying and losing his memories. Turn out he was part of a dangerous terrorist organization and seeking out for a new life. Of course his old organization will not let him have his way that easily. Well, there is nothing new from this kind of story and nothing is wrong neither since the part about the organization and their method of recruitment were interesting. 
There are surely top notch fighting scenes with our infinite stamina protagonist. It might be physically impossible but well he is the man, again there is nothing wrong about this.
The only thing I can't stand was the gun fight. I mean adding gun fights in action movie is actually good but everyone just have no sense of aiming and no one realize that they can kill enemy without have to point the gun right on the face. And there was even a moment where a grenade can launch a person to the air but it can't even break a glass window. In conclusion the movie has a fine plot and settings, the hand/melee combats are top notch but the ""gun physics"" (also explosives effect) are kinda minus for the overall fighting scene. I hope they will done it better in the future works."
" No matter what, the bad past always hunts you down!
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,5,"Like everybody, I was anticipating 'The Raid 3', instead I got this one. Iko Uwais is not just a rising star, he is making Indonesian films internationally recognised. But seems as fast he's rising, as fast he's sinking. The reason is heavily relied on martial arts. In real life, he himself an artist too. But taking into the account like from Tony Jaa, and Hong Kong, Chinese film industries. That's a one generation thing. To keep the industry on the float in the long term, it takes good stories and performances, alongside good production.'The Raid' duology was good, but not lucky anymore. Basically, this is the same pattern with different characters and situations compared to those two titles. The stunt fans might enjoy it, but what terribly lacked in this film was the a good story. The majority of the film goers, including film critics believe in that. Hence it did not deliver as expected. By the way, this is a generation of CGI film like 'Mad Max: Fury Road'. Yet some kids from the 90s still love to see a pure martial art films.It is an action packed film. A gangster theme. The day when a notorious gangster leader named Lee escapes the prison, a young man was found unconscious on the beach, then he was treated by an aspiring young doctor. Lee finds out about this amnesiac man and sends his finest men to retrieve him. But nothing goes as planned. The confrontation between them slowly restores his lost memory. Defeating all the fighters, he's set for the final standoff against Lee which will bring an end to the narration.❝You saved me before. I need you to save me one more time.❞The production was good, though the performances were ordinary. Because all the focus were the action sequences. At least I expected decent dialogues. It was a weird romance platform, a sub-genre. Romance can blossom anywhere, anytime, but weakly developed to believe it the least. Not the best martial art film too. There were some twists in the narration, but none were surprising enough. The film would have achieved a better result if it had done well in the stunt parts. I'm sure there will be some people who would like it or liked it. I usually like martial art films, but not this one, not my cup of tea.Sometimes the opening does not matter if the rest of the tale recovers well. Very clichéd initiation, but it did not get better. Especially the conclusion was a big let down. The entire film was leaned on Iko's role. Also the character Lee was too much hyped. In between them, the rest of the cast was discarded. Overall, I don't think they have missed an opportunity in here, because I felt nothing were designed so well to be a decent film at any level. From familiarity to the predictability, the storytelling never had the upper hand to get better. Some people think it is worth watching at least once, but according to me not. All I would say is it's your call.4.5/10"
" The most violent martial arts flick ever?
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,7,"It's not every day you see a martial arts movie which may be as violent as any horror flick released the same year. ""Headshot"" is one such movie. It might be second only to ""The Story of Ricky"" in terms of violence, but whereas that one was a cartoonish gore flick, this one is disturbingly realistic, at least in its handling of injury. Off the top of my head we have people getting stabbed through the head sideways, a loose bullet being jammed into someone's eyeball, and someone being impaled on a broken tree branch and then trying to pull someone else onto the spike. Also, countless people are shot to death. You've heard of the Hongkongese genre ""heroic bloodshed""? You don't have to be a hero to shed blood in this one.The ""story"" is the usual ""violent man with no past saves people while other people come to get them"". I think they tacked on some kind of non-explanation for how the violent characters got that way; something about a covert operation training child soldiers. From what you see of this shady business, it is impossible to believe that anyone could come from it and be proficient at fighting; it's one of the dumbest contrivances I have seen in a recent movie. These scenes don't depict a hardcore training program for brats: they're more like an extremely inefficient method to kill children en masse.But you don't (and won't) care about that stuff. You care about the fight scenes, and yes, they are impressive. I didn't think they were as impressive as ""The Raid 2""'s, but it's hard to imagine too many fans of those kinds of movies will leave this one disappointed."
" B-rated Jason Bourne with A-okay fight scenes
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,6,"So I only watched this movie because I really enjoyed The Raid 1 and 2. However, compared to The Raid, it was pretty disappointing. The plot is a cheap, B-rated version of Jason Bourne. Fighting scenes are pretty okay, but not as breathtaking as The Raid. Still, lots of blood and some nice moves.This movie should not be taken too seriously. It was entertaining once, but I would not watch it a second time."
" A fun, fast and frenetic Raid rip-off
",2017-10-11 00:00:00,6,"They say imitation is the highest form of flattery, so on that note Welsh director Gareth Evans should be highly chuffed with Indonesian film Headshot.An Indonesian action/thriller that not only feels like a first cousin/half-brother to Evan's first two Raid films, but stars its breakout performer Iko Uwais, Headshot aims for the frenetic nature The Raid seemingly invented as we were introduced to the apartment complex from hell in 2011 and while Kimo Stamboel and Timo Tjahjanto's film never reaches The Raid's or its standout sequel's heights, this valiant effort is a sight bit better than your average standard action event.Not holding back in its depiction of brutal violence and feats that should've ended in instant death, Headshot sees Uwais's Ishmael awaking with a particularly nasty headache and a potential new love interest in the form of Chelsea Islan's kindly nurse Ailin, only to find out his the target of a group of hard-core baddies and with the simple and over the top set-up (much like once again, Evan's films), Headshot acts as an excuse to deliver some far-out set pieces that showcase Uwais's skills as a beat-down master.Capturing the video game vibe and essence that came across in The Raid films, Ishmael's journey to rescue Ailin and kill all the big bad's including Sunny Pang's ruthless leader Lee feels as though his going from boss fight to boss fight within interesting locations from a bus, a curiously badly secured police station and exotic looking beaches as Ishmael kills off goons one by one in inventive fashion, only to ruin his good work whenever the film stops to try and become emotional and actually tell a story.Something The Raid film's managed to overcome with pure unrelenting energy and story twists and turns, Headshot's weak dialogue, so-so to bad performances and cheesily constructed narrative often undoes the films action wins and no amount of white knuckle showdowns and shootouts can save Headshot from its amateurish execution in these areas, even if you won't care to much when the hits start being landed.Final Say – Not quite a poor man's Raid but not worthy of being talked about alongside Evan's classic action epics, Headshot is an often brutal and fun actioner that feels like an easy to digest entrée too what is Evan's Raid swansong in the years coming, which is hopefully sooner, rather than later.3 chopsticks out of 5"
" I wanted to like this movie
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,3,"The only thing spoiled in this are the movie's directors/choreographer. The fight scenes are too long and make no sense. The fighting is also very unbalanced, w/ the star knowing very little about fighting, then he gets good and then gets bad again. The same goes for his physical being, he's hurt badly, then he gets a boost of adrenaline, then he goes limp again, over and over again. If I didn't like Iko Uwais so much I would have given this only one star and shut off the movie at the beginning hoping the movies plot would get better."
" A Big Kick of Disappointment
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,4,"Headshot looked so golden off the trailer. I was a huge fan of The Raid and thus it's star Iko Uwais. Uwais also stars here as a stranger who awakens from a coma with a case of amnesia and a bullet hole in his forehead. Just who is he and how was he shot? And how is he connected to a brutal gang leader who has just escaped execution? These are the questions at the core of the plot of Headshot. Headshot has some great fight scenes for sure. WhIle not nearly as polished in that department as The Raid, it still swings a big enough stick to showcase that Indonesia continues to be a force to be reckoned with in the action arena. There is also a key factor surrounding the background of the gang and how it recruits that adds a compelling aspect to the otherwise clichéd storyline.But that factor and the good fight scenes are hindered by terrible dialogue and the aforementioned clichés. Uwais is fine here and shows he has the chops to be an A list international star. He also is helped by a terrific Sunny Pang as the vicious gang leader Lee. But they are not nearly enough to save Headshot. The Raid was top shelf stuff. Headshot is Monarch mixed with good juice."
" Not great TBH
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,4,"Surprised this film got such high ratings from others. I've seen a few Indonesian Action/Martial Arts films, and this is probably the worst. I actually got bored during the action scenes which is not a good sign for a martial arts film.The plot is very cliché, which is usually fine with a lot of action films...if the action is good, but here it isn't. The fighting is very repetitive, and you never really get to find out what makes the main characters tick. It's a very shallow action film, with mediocre fight scenes.The highlight of the film was the cinematography, lots of nice shots and angles, and its also nicely graded so the film looks very nice.I'd give it a miss. There's a film Korean film called The Man from Nowhere with similar themes to this film, but its 100 times better."
" More violence than you can shake a broken arm at.
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,8,"Silat star Iko Uwais plays a nameless man pulled out of the ocean and taken to hospital where pretty doctor Ailin (Chelsea Islan) waits patiently for him to regain consciousness. What Ailin doesn't realise is that the mysterious man, who she names Ishmael, is being hunted by a criminal organisation that abducts children and trains them to be ruthless killers.Headshot is not on a par with Iko Uwais' The Raid movies, lacking the simple efficiency of the first Raid movie and the dramatic power and scope of the sequel. It does, however, deliver plenty of what the star's fans expect from his films: namely, brilliantly choreographed bone crunching brutality with lashings of gore. From the opening scene, in which criminal mastermind Lee (Sunny Pang) breaks out of prison leaving numerous bloody bodies in his wake, to the final smack-down between Ishmael and his adoptive father, Headshot is a gleefully violent movie, with countless characters meeting very sticky and extremely painful ends.The story might be a tad simplistic and a little overly melodramatic at times, but with graphic mutilation (nastiest moments being a shell casing in the eye and a machete through the face), bodies riddled with bullets, and some truly bad-ass martial arts resulting in broken bones aplenty, this film is almost certain to please fans of extreme Asian action."
" great action scenes
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,8,"I really liked this movie, it offers great action scenes with Iko Uwais. The story is good and I was interested in knowing the protagonist's past. Aniway,I would have added the deleted scenes. As one of them, really explains the story behind the protagonist and why he acts in certain ways. So, great movie but you need to watch the deleted scenes to understand it even more."
" You get exactly what you expect! [+68%]
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,7,"There is a certain suspension of disbelief when the viewer signs up to watch an actioner like 'Headshot'. Kimo Stamboel & Timo Tjahjanto (dubbed the Mo brothers) tread high-octane action territory (a.la Gareth Evans' The Raid) after their impressive outings in horror (Macabre) and crime-thriller (Killers). The viewer pretty much knows what to expect: a wafer-thin storyline, bucketfuls of gore, horrendous fatalities & well-choreographed stunt sequences. Thankfully, the duo keep their promise. The cast comprising Iko Uwais, Sunny Pang, Julie Estelle and Very Tri Yulisman deliver the goods in stunning fashion. An amnesiac is helped by a young doctor in recalling his past which comes back to haunt him in startling ways. The film however starts off detailing the manipulative skills of the antagonist when he escapes prison. Once the film embraces 'action- mode', there's no looking back. There are some slickly shot fights - one that takes place within/around the confines of a bus and another at a police-station (my favorite of the lot!). The camera-work is quite fluid and the fists-to-the-jaws look undeniably excruciating. The climax sequence although well thought-out and judiciously shot, pales in comparison to the earlier ones. This isn't a film where you sit and analyze the acting talent of the ensemble but Chelsea Islan's presence does uplift certain scenes. Iko Uwais has yet again proved his mettle as a reliable lead faring spectacularly in the action department and reasonably fine in the acting. That said, 'Headshot' is strictly for action aficionados. If you're the kind who gets turned on watching splendidly assembled action set- pieces that involve the usage of fists, swords, canes, guns, fire-extinguishers, typewriters and telephones (accompanied by some bone-breaking), this film will dazzle you, although not on the levels of 'The Raid'. Highly looking forward to Timo's solo directorial 'The Night Comes Before Us' featuring some of the actors from this film and 'The Raid'."
" What if I am Not a Good Person
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,6,"The film opens with Indonesian Crime Lord Lee (Sunny Pang) escaping from prison. Two months later a man is washed up on shore with a head wound. He is attended by Dr.Ailin (Chelsea Islan) and assumes the name Ishmael (Iko Uwais). Lee discovers ""Ismael"" is still alive and sets his forces out to destroy him. The film is filled with flashbacks to describe their relationship which can be summed up in one word, 'Fagin."" If you have ever seen an action film before, you know the formula.This is an Indonesian grindhouse. It could have used a heavier soundtrack. Most of the one on one fighting was good, other times it looked like a JCVD spoof. The opening close range fire fight scene made me initially think this was going to be a Jackie Chan style comedy, but as it turns out, it wasn't meant to be funny. That is just how they roll.I watched the film with English subtitles.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
" Unforgettable
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,2,"Indonesian born Iko Uwais portrayal of officer Rama in ""The Raid: Redemption"" is destined to be a modern action classic, but his latest effort ""Headshot"" is certain to meet an opposite fate. This rebuttal of acclaim lies solely in the hands of the filmmakers (the two directors) who I believe wanted to create a story-driven action movie with minimal dialogues and well-executed Asian panache. What really drags it all down is the confusing material and lack of chemistry between the actors. Anybody watching this collection of moving pictures just for the violence, will not be disappointed. It delivers."
" Unfortunately not very good
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,3,"I watched this movie knowing it wasn't going to be half as good as the raid, but at least hoping it had good action. Not so much. There was so much over acting on every death, some parts I actually cringed at. Ohhhh uhhhhghhh I'm getting hit and shot... bleh. I could barely get through the movie. I don't mind giving this movie movie money in hopes iko goes back to the raid movies. You can tell they tried to make it similar to those movies, but they failed in comparison. I feel like my brother and I made better choreographed fight scenes on our trampoline when we were young. Why are you having iko fight for a weapon when clearly he's made for martial arts? He literally didn't look like he could win any of the fights in this movie. Let's just have him fight one guy at a time and then have another come right after and almost lose every fight. I didn't like this movie at all. The worst part of the movie was the slow motion hits that didn't even look painful. They would get stabbed, shot and stabbed again, but for some reason would slow down an action shot for the worst looking hit. Especially during his fight with the girl. I laughed it was so bad. Oh booom kicked in an awkward position. What a hit! What a load of crap. Move along."
" wow !!!!
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,10,This is only the second time am writing a review for a movie here after being here so many years. This film is awesome ! what made me write this review is the ingenuity of the movie. Some of the details feels completely real and not staged. The combination of music oh my ! and the way film was shot is just beautiful ! Loved it ! if you enjoyed The raid and the raid 2 watch this. It feels like it has so much more soul to it in compare to those for me.
" Call Me Ishmael
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,8,"Another drop-dead serious martial arts movie from star Iko Uwais. This movie is neither light nor kid-friendly, so make sure to watch it when they are out of the house.There is nothing new here in terms of plot--another reviewer called this an Indonesian version of ""Bourne Identity"", and that is pretty accurate--but what makes this movie stand above the rest is by bringing some emotional heft as it delves into characters' emotional backgrounds.If you're looking for something that treats martial arts as something dangerous rather than entertaining and doesn't shy away from the darker side of life, then this might just be what you're looking for."
" Awesome.
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,10,"After an amnesiac is nursed back to health by a doctor, his past comes back to haunt him.Headshot was directed by Timo Tjahjanto and Kimo Stamboel, known as the Mo Brothers, who had never directed an action film before. Timo wrote the storyline in 2 and a half weeks and claimed that ""it may be the fastest story I've ever produce."" The film was produced by Screenplay Infinite Films. Besides starring in the film, Iko Uwais also lead the choreography team for 3 weeks. In the film, every character has their own fighting style, such as silat, wushu, or brutal fighting, based on the background of the actor."
" A mediocre action movie...
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,5,"After some very intense performances in ""The Raid"" and ""The Raid: Redemption"", I was more than thrilled and excited to get a chance to sit down and watch ""Headshot"" which starred Iko Uwais.However, I must say that my expectations were not met, because ""Headshot"" turned out to be a subpar storyline that lacked the same level of intensity and in-your-face brutality as the previous movies such as the two ""The Raid"" movies and also ""Merentau"". So it was somewhat of a disappointing viewing experience.Furthermore, ""Headshot"" wasn't really delivering the same amount of action as seen in previous Iko Uwais movies, and that was also sort of a disappointment. Of course, not all of his movies can be the same level of adrenaline and action, but still...The storyline in ""Headshot"" was adequate, for sure. But it was just not outstanding or particularly memorable. And it sort of just found a comfortable pace early on and trotted onward in that same pace until the very end. There were aspects to the storyline that were good, no doubt about it. But the overall impression just happened to be somewhat generic.Now, of course there is action in ""Headshot"", and the action scenes and sequences are quite nicely choreographed and executed. So when there was action on the screen, it was quite good.If you previously haven't familiarized yourself with the work of Iko Uwais, then ""Headshot"" is definitely a good movie for the introduction, before you move on to the more intense and action-packed movies he has on his resumé."
" Let's try to kill a guy during two hours
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,3,"I'm still waiting to watch my first good Indonesian movie because Headshot isn't the one. I read somewhere that it is a good movie for people who like a lot of action. Well I do like a lot of action every now and then but certainly not this kind of action. It's all so fake it becomes an embarrassment. There is a lot of action, no doubt about that, but the action scenes are most of the time painful to watch. Our local hero, who everybody wants dead, can easily fight twenty though guys. Nothing wrong with that if he's that good and/or strong. But the problem that I have is why those twenty guys are just waiting their turn to try to kill him. Just attack him with twenty at once and job's done. The entire movie it is like that. And our local hero of course gets injured a lot but by miracle every next fight he has he's completely cured. From limping one second before, to beast mode in the next combat. And when there is machine gun shooting with a target at about two meters from you it's impossible to miss, just saying... The actors are also not that great. Everybody speaks Indonesian, what is absolutely logic since it is over there, except one that talks in English. Why he speaks in English is a mystery to everybody. There are loads of things that just don't make sense in this movie and that's why it's just not good. The filming is professional, that's for sure, the story is also okay, but the execution is just lame."
" Skip
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,3,"If you've watched the Raids and expect the same quality of a movie, then skip this movie, please. The quality is sub-par to say the least. The directors are different, so you can tell the action sequences are less realistic; the acting is less average; the story line, well, makes even less sense than the Raids (although the Raids are much more enjoyable), the pace is slow, it's just dragging...Let's just hope Gareth Evans makes another movie soon with the same team!"
" ***** Top Notch Action Film *****
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,10,"IMDb member for 11 years. Big fan of the martial arts genre. I can tell you that this movie improves everything we liked about the Raid movies and much more.I wasn't so sure from the trailer and this being Iko's first film with no Gareth and Ruhian (Mad Dog) if it could be any better. But never worry, Iko took the best of what The Raid films had to offer and transcends the genre again.As a whole, the film is the complete package. You get a story that is just about the other characters as it is the main one. Every performance is believable and emotional where everyone grows into their role. ** spoiler ** And no one is left out of the final acts of the film. 1 of the 2 brothers is actually deaf, Ailin is pulled from a world of healing to a world of killing, All the characters from Ishmael's life bring a different 'end product' to the Assassins Lee has created.Violence wise you will not be disappointed. Past criticism of these top modern top martial arts movies is the lack of guns present in a violent world. Well this movie has all of that, like I mentioned the inspired 'Gang War deleted scene in The Raid 2' is prolonged and enhanced into the story in the first 5 minutes of this film! Blood spluttering, bodies riddled with bullets it really surpasses anything before it.The Director knows how to show the modern use of guns, special effects, weapons and hand to hand getting it on camera in such a visceral way most of the shots being single rotating one takes and ALL of them being pulled back enough. The unarmed vs armed scenes are an eye to behold and is really more gritty yet still choreographed that it works.There is so much to go on about this film. The main thing is the many improvements made from similar scenes in Iko's previous films - the set design, choreography, level of violence, mixed martial arts Kung fu, with MMA and Silat, etc - and attention to detail in every scene truly makes it the Martial Arts Action-er to beat in 2017.And really the only one to do that is The Night Comes for Us (2017) by the same everyone involved in this film plus Ruhian and Joe Taslim. You've been warned!"
" The fight choreography is phenomenal. It is brutal n intense.
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,10,"I really wanted to see this on big screen but saw this on a 50 rs pirated copy. Had seen all of Iko Uwais' films. Had enjoyed The Raid in theatre. The plot line for Headshot may sound familiar, a man found on a shore, wounded and unconscious, wakes up in a rural hospital unable to remember anything. His attending lady physician gives him a new name. Later we come to know that the amnesiac man can do hand to hand combat n other self defense tactics efficiently. Viewers may compare this to Jason bourne, Kill bill or Faster but believe me this movie ain't no another revenge or secret agent run of the mill. This movie is an awesome adrenaline filled, high octane, brutal n bloody action film. Directed by Timo Tjahjanto and Kimo Stamboel (Macabre, Killers). They know how to position their camera best to capture Uwais in full on furious action mode. There is some good camera work n with the attractive locations, the film does engage visually too. The editing is frenetic. The action is non stop. But it is Uwais who is the star of this film. Uwais delivers the bone-breaking, gravity defying flurry of kicks, punches, eye gouges, and throat throttling. His action choreography is the best. This movie also has some of the best movie martial artists and stunt performers in the world — Iko Uwais, Julie Estelle, Very Tri Yulisman, Sunny pang, Zack Lee n David Hendrawan. Anything n everything can be a weapon when controlled by true masters : chopsticks, desks, broken plates, bus seats, pistols, shot guns, machete, rods, etc. but fists, elbows n feet are much deadlier weapons when controlled by them. Jason bourne, Kill bill n Faster looks like kindergarten in front of Headshot."
" Solid Action Movie - Fans of The Raid Will Be Pleased
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,7,"Being a big fan of The Raid I & II, I was looking forward to watching this movie once I had seen the trailer. Headshot proves to be one hell of a brutal action film that really earns its R rating. The action is pretty relentless and doesn't let up with with the movie racking up a solid body count within the first 20 minutes. Iko Uwais is a great up and coming action star and choreographs and pulls off some amazing fight sequences like he's done in other films (Man of Tai Chi, Merantau). Although the movie probably could of been more focused and efficient in terms of the story and the characters motivations, it is still well paced for a two hour film and action packed throughout. Overall, a solid early contender for one of the best action films of 2017.7/10"
" Surprisingly tight action outing
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,7,"Short review: Nicely plotted, acted, little action thriller. The two hours go by fairly quickly.Longer review: Some have suggested that this is Bourne with ""more violence."" And especially after the sorry mess that was the last Bourne film (see my IMDb review) such a feat would have been welcome. But no it is not. The Bourne story -- the top professional with a slight memory problem -- was much more subtle, This is more like Tony Jaa from Ong Bak (who actually looks like the star here!) waking up with a migraine and then everyone on the planet tries to kill him.The action scenes are wonderful, except for the very first scene in the prison, which features too many automatic weapons going off at once. Some are especially memorable. For example -- just a tease -- this film will teach you how the very same bullet can kill a man twice. Once when you fire it. And again when you get your hands on the spent cartridge.Recommended."
" Iko Uwais deliver AGAIN !!!
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,9,For all action movie fan out there if you guys tired with typical Hollywood shaky-cam action scene when you can't hardly see the action at all and the long wait for The Raid 3 to come out then this movie: Headshot is the solution.Just like the tiles Headshot is the fresh new action movie came out in Indonesia from The Mo Brothers staring the incredible Iko Uwais one again prove his name to be the new household of action-martial arts movie.Follow the plot that highly like The Bourne Trilogy but wished it were way more violent Iko has to travel a long journey full of blood and destruction when he encounter a large number of highly trained killer which put the level of violent and brutality far more than ever.The fight scene is very well choreographed with good used of shaky-cam plus some interesting camera move that make every frame fell dirty and realistic.Even through the background story of some certain character are not the best and they acting not like a human at all when taking some pretty nasty stuff their body but still keep moving like a zombie.If you guys can look through all that this maybe the best martial arts movie in recent years
" A top bit of Indonesian action cinema
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,8,"HEADSHOT is an Indonesian action movie that stars Iko Uwais in his first main action role after THE RAID films. It was directed by the Mo Brothers, who previously made the extra-dark serial killer thriller KILLERS, and like KILLERS this is a dark film indeed featuring some ultra-gory action and kill sequences. Plot-wise, it's a simple Indonesian version of THE BOURNE IDENTITY, with Uwais waking up after being found on a beach having been shot in the head.Suspense comes from scenes featuring the imposing Sunny Pang as the villain of the piece. The early scenes in which he breaks out of prison are incredibly harrowing and well directed. The first part of the film builds character in some slow but solid scenes before letting rip with the fight action around the middle section. Action lovers will be in their element with the fast and furious martial arts sequences which feel much like the ones in THE RAID. The set-piece surrounding the bus in the woods is electrifying, but the battle in the police station is the real highlight here and an incredible bit of action which out-does THE RAID and its sequel.After this highlight the film slows down a gear and becomes more predictable, although it's still good. The second half of the film consists of just three one-on-one fight scenes and plays out predictably, lacking the suspense and breathless excitement of the first part. The fights are still exceptional though and Julie Estelle and Very Tru Yulisman are welcome additions from THE RAID 2. The final fight recalls the one at the end of THE RAID and is pulse-pounding. HEADSHOT is an extremely violent film that once again proves that Asian action cinema is head and shoulders above equivalent Western fare, and let's hope that Uwais continues to make this kind of film for years to come."
" Weak character motivation does not stop this from being a true crowd-pleaser!
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,9,"Note: Check me out as the Asian Movie Enthusiast on YouTube, where I review tons of Asian movies. After being inflicted with a gunshot wound to the head, a young man's unconscious body washes ashore in a rural town. For the next few months, a concerned doctor looks over him and his recovery. He eventually wakes up from his coma but suffers from temporary memory loss. Unfortunately for him, his enemies (a group of gangsters who specialize in the selling of guns and drugs) soon discover that he is alive and come back to finish the job.Before we get to the action, I should mention that the biggest flaw of this movie is the character development. Ironically, I thought the Mo Brothers did a very nice job in their last film ""Killers"" because the multi-dimensional personalities of the serial killers were even more interesting than the violence and thriller elements, in my opinion. ""Headshot"" is the complete opposite, and that's especially true in terms of character motivation specifically. I just saw this movie and I don't remember why exactly these gangsters shot our protagonist in the head at the beginning. Or why this cute doctor is so enamored with him. So yes, there are a lot of character motivation problems, but to be perfect honest – it almost doesn't matter because this movie offers a lot of action and violence to compensate.Now if you've seen The Raid movies (directed by Gareth Evans) and you're expecting something similar here due to some of the returning cast members and the production companies, let me give you some advice. This is a Mo Brothers film, not a Gareth Evans film. That's important to understand, because those are two different beasts with different directing styles. But with that said, you do have Iko Uwais handling the fight choreography in Headshot, so there will be some overlap in terms of action design.And here's the deal with the action design. No spoilers, of course. The final half hour, which consists of a three part finale, does have the precise, complex martial arts choreography that you expect from films like The Raid. In fact, the last fight is legitimately satisfying and somewhat surprising because of two reasons: first, the main villain does not fight much at all until that moment; and second, he uses an unexpected form of martial arts that really adds some variety and excitement. In addition, there are some moments in ""Headshot"" where nearby objects – that are not typically used as weapons in everyday life – are used to stun or straight-up murder people. That's one of the signature traits in films directed by Gareth Evans. So that's the aforementioned ""overlap"" that I was talking about.With that said, however, everything before that three stage finale feels like a Mo Brothers film. Which basically means that the first 2/3rds of ""Headshot"" primarily showcases scrappy, simplistically choreographed, blunt, visceral death scenes that would be more at home in a thriller or horror film. Characters are just trying to survive in this movie, and many of them don't. The death scenes in this are very memorable, creative, and gory. There's one scene near the end where a dude gets shot and it reminded me of that infamous scene in Robocop when the ED-209 eviscerated that salaryman in the conference room. Yeah, that's how the violence in this movie works. It's excessive . . . even more so than The Raid movies. But that excessiveness is a lot of fun to watch for people who enjoy ""hard R"" rated action movies and there's actually a bit of black humor that is thrown in at times. So the Mo Brothers really did put their stamp on this.Another thing that I noticed with regard to the action design, is that there's a surprising absence of one-vs-many fights in this. We're used to seeing at least one or two scenes of Iko taking down hordes of baddies in Merantau and The Raid movies, but that does not happen often in ""Headshot"" despite the huge quantity of fighting. It's almost like every fight is a one-on-one match of survival, even in those cases where multiple characters are involved. And that creates a very different feel to ""Headshot"" because some of the ""stock henchmen"" are incredibly difficult to kill. And you may have a handful of these dudes lurking around a crashed bus site, or a police station, or a forest hideout, and our hero has to slowly explore and make his way thru these surroundings while taking out each of these guys one at a time. That also helps to make every death scene very personal and memorable.That action format also helps to create a fantastic pacing. I read a few online reviews that criticized the opening half hour for being slow, but I completely disagree with that assessment. After watching this movie twice in the theater, I don't think 10 minutes went by – at any point in this film – without someone getting violently murdered or beaten. That is not an exaggeration. And the locations change quite a bit, so there's plenty of variety in that regard too. Make no mistake about it – this is a crowd-pleaser for fans of visceral action.Before I leave you tonight, I wanted to point out one more thing – the music and scoring, which are fantastic. There's even some use of heavy, ominous synthesizer music that worked really well. It had a John Carpenter vibe to it, and considering how one of the most memorable sequences occurs in a police station, perhaps the Mo Brothers are fans of Assault on Precinct 13. I would not be surprised."
