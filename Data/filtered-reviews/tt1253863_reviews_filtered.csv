" A big mistake in Persian illustration
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,1,"The design of the clothes and faces of the Persians is wrong and also showing the savages of the wrongly portrayed Persians.
It is enough to have only seen the building of Persepolis. You will notice that a completely wrong image of the Persians has been made."
" Waste of time
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,2,"No real story. No development of characters. No surprises. No deeper value. Nothing. Maybe just funny CGI (first star) and breasts of Eva Green (second star). Poor attempt to earn some more money on 300 success.Oh yes and absurd stupid women power fantasy of two ""stroooong"" women leading armoes of bodybuilder sentimental fanatics.Its honestly not worth watching. It literally offers nothing more than you saw with 300."
" Like an even cheesier ridiculous version of the first
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,8,"Everyone likes 300 it's great stupid action dumb slow mo shirtless dudes the whole shabang this is the same movie but with 5 major improvements Eva Green, Callan Mulvey (seriously he's awesome I'm this movie) cool Boats, less weird mutant monsters and the most wacky looking CGI blood since the bad guy in Blade 1, there's a few downgrades like the lack of Gerard Butlers very not greek accent and less of the god king Xerxes
but this movie was not well recieved and will probably never get a sequel it which it deserves the long and short of it is this movie genuinely rocks it's not as viceral as the first one cos of the wacky blood effects but I think they add such a unique graphic novel vibe to it which the first one captured well bit in different ways you should give it a watch show it some love."
" 8/10
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,8,"I really liked this movie and enjoyed the cinematography very much, this is a sequel to the movie 300, continuing the story after the death of kind leonidas and how Athens came into unity with Sparta against king Xerxes of Persia.

" Stg one of the worst movies I've seen in my life
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,1,Nothing redeemable in the slightest. Worst than the first. I'd rather do my taxes than watch this movie again.
" BLOODY FUN
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,7,"300: Rise of an Empire is not a follow-up but a 'side-sequel'. Set before, during and after Sparta's last stand, this is the same war on another front, a maritime duel between Sullivan Stapleton's heroic Themistokles and Eva Green's psychotic Artemisia. This 'side-sequel' is an adrenaline blast of bloody fun. It is really entertaining but it doesn't improve the semplicity of the plot's first movie. While in the first film there's a great ending, in this 'side-sequel' there's an epic prologue.
Rating: 7,5"
" Messy, muddled, overblown and under-cast
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,4,"Sullivan Stapleton (who, right?) is no Gerard Butler, that's for sure. The rest of the Greeks are also instantly forgettable no-names with limited acting ability.That leaves the film hanging off of Eva Green, who puts in a decent performance but is embarrassingly petite and un-muscular. Physics and physique apparently worked very differently in the ancient world, because Green looks like she's barely capable of lifting a sword, let along wielding it against an adult male. Same problem with Lena Headey: it's pure cringe to watch these tiny little women do action scenes.As to that action, it's over-done. Far, far too much slow-motion, blood effects that are more comical than comic, and for the Gods' sake, stop throwing away your shields. Less would have been more.The plot is unsure of itself, the pacing is erratic, the story isn't engaging, and Green's sex scene is distinctly uncomfortable. I doubt she's proud of doing it.There's just not that much to enjoy here."
" The worst
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,1,The worst movie ever filmed. Disgrace for Greek culture and history
" Army of Artisans?
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,5,For an army of artisans they look pretty damn buff. Sculptors that life weights? Lol funny. One thing that let's this flick down.....lack of realism.
" A sequel nobody asked for
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,4,"This isnt story of 300 and isnt real,the story is far away from the reality and it has much blood"
" An absolute beautiful movie and story.
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,9,"The first 300 was great, and so was this one. It's a great story, with visual effects and action throughout. If you didn't like this movie, then you don't enjoy movies for what movies are supposed to be about. Well acted, well told and we'll illustrated. Everything I look for in a movie."
" Great distortion
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,1,"Again Snyder Rotated the history 180 degrees:
1. Themistocles didn't kill Xerxes's father, King Darius.
2.Xerxes didn't transform into a God King in real life and it's a lie.
3. Artemisia's family didn't murder by Greek Hoplites and she was never a slave. she was not even Greek if you want you can search in internet and see how she really likes.
4. Themistocles and Artemisia never loved or met each other and during these war artemisia was married
5. Artemisia didn't die in these war.
6. Which empire did exactly rised?
7. In Battle of Salamis the queen of Spartans sent only 16 navies in reality but here we see they sent all of there navy force and if they were not there Athens was gonna fell down.
8. In Battle of Salamis none of the parties to the conflict won the war.
9.According to history, the Athenians and Spartans were bloody enemy and never trusted each other until about 450 BC, and even if they sometimes helped each other outside this historical period, it was for their own benefit and on a very small scale.
and other mistakes that you can search in internet."
" Cgi blood ruins batlle
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,4,"It is an okay movie, but the amount of cgi blood and the look of the movie where still new and fun in 2006 in the movie 300. Now it's all overstyled and too much."
" Miscasting
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,7,Not so bad movie but the actors are terrible miscast. Wrong actors for the roles. And the acting itself was just bareable. Just.
" A cartoon for the ages
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,3,Too much CGI. It looks like a couple actors placed in a cartoon. Too difficult to watch for me.
" ""300: Rise Of An Empire"" - Saved By Eva Green.
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,8,"From IMDB: ""Greek general Themistokles leads the charge against invading Persian forces led by mortal-turned-god Xerxes and Artemisia, vengeful commander of the Persian navy.""Aussi born Sullivan Stapleton plays the Greek General who specializes in naval warfare. French born actress Eva Green plays the amazing Artemisia (she really existed in history - Google her) and Lena Headey (Game of Thrones) plays the avenging Queen from the first ""300.""There is less action here than in the first ""300"" but IMO, the standout is definitely Eva Green, she plays the part as both scheming and somewhat
sadistic, is a brilliant swordswoman - and she really hates The Greeks (You'll see why in graphic detail.). This time around the movie features the Ex Persian King's son, Xerxes; who is now a God (at least in the eyes of his people.)Great naval battles galore - the (now) expected topless/sex scene from Eva,
and many interesting twists and turns. Director Zack Snyder delivers, again."
" Good enough to not ruin the original
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,6,"Given the choice ( I don't know why I wasn't asked) I would never have made a sequel to 300. Too much risk.But the $$$ spoke loudly and a sequel we have.Its an ok movie, Eva Green is fantastic, Sullivan Stapleton is average at best.The story is ok, the visuals are good, the movie as I mentioned is good enough to not have caused harm to the original but not much more."
" Why is so much hate?
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,7,"Of course this movie not Epic as the first 300, but yet it's still a very decent movie to watch."
" Naval Gazing.
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,4,"Having discovered a couple of weeks back, that the original ""300"" has lost most of it's appeal to me over the years, I wasn't super excited about revisiting its sequel - a film I didn't really enjoy when I saw it at the cinema. It's not gotten any better with perspective, and to say it cost around double the original, still manages to feel like a cheap knock off.Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton) an Athenian General, attempts to unify Greece's various city states to meet the threat of a Persian invasion, led by Xerxes's (Rodrigo Santoro) most feared commander, Artemisla (Eva Green). With news of Leonidas, and his brave 300 Spartans making a stand against the land army, Themistokles uses all his cunning to battle an overwhelmingly large naval force and still rally support from across the country.The most interesting aspect of ""Rise of an Empire"" is that it serves as sequel, prequel and runs concurrently with the events of the original ""300"". Unfortunately, that's the only really interesting aspect. Sullivan Stapleton, whilst not awful, doesn't have Gerard Butler's charisma and though he has many more speeches, none of them are that interesting. His supporting soldiers too, come across like a budget version of the originals. Michael Fassbender replaced by Hans Matheson, Callan Mulvey or Jack O' Connell. It's not this films fault, and again, none of them are bad - but also true none of them have, so far, gone on to have a career like Fassbenders. Whilst there's a lot of praise for Green, and she is definitely the most dynamic and interesting part of the film - it's not like we haven't seen her play similar characters before.What kills the film though is that the battles, whilst just as tiringly relentless as in ""300"", don't have the variety or spectacular elements as its prequel did. Just lashings of dodgy CGI blood and ships crashing into each other.$100 Million somehow spent to make something that looks and feels like a low budget imitation."
" Even worse than the first 300
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,1,"The first 300 was nothing more than ghey pr0n.This 300 similarly has semi-naked sweaty men grappling with one another, the same lifeless CGI, bad writing and computer-generated six-pack abs.But along the way it mixes in a rough s3x scene, or maybe that was female r#pe, I don't know, but in any event it's not ghey pr-n, it's just pr-n pr-n.And then the sweaty men go back to being ghey with each other.Such a terrible movie. No wonder teenage boys grow up to find the only dates they can get are on FB."
" Good
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,7,"Everything I said about the first film also applies to this one. Essentially, it's more of the same. A visually striking epic CGI spectacle in comic-book style, whose story is both the prologue and the epilogue to the first film. Besides the really powerful visual aspect and excellent choreography of action scenes, this film has not much to offer. The cast is weaker than in the original, except for the fantastic Eva Green. 
7/10"
" Amazing actors
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,3,Amazing actors but terrible script and direction. Unnessary violence
" action packed, but lacks story and depth like the first 300
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,5,"Over the top action, but lacks narrative, depth and storyline the original 300 had. would not watch again."
" A mighty sequel
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,9,"Rise of an empire in my opinion is almost as good as the first with gory and awesome battles, a good intersecting story, beautiful art direction, good performances, and a great villian played by Eva green. The only bad things are the characters are not memorable and some cgi looks terrible. An epic movie and I highly recommend it."
" Doomed to Fail
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,4,"The original was so popular, people had burnt themselves out by the sequel. The nobleness of the 1st replaced with cheesiness. This movie truly was a - 'Chronicles of Riddick' compared to 'Pitch Black' - level of misreading everything that made the 1st film great."
" Pure Garbage
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,1,"Go watch the first film not this one. This film is an assault on one's moral and intellectual sensibilities.The first film was quite excellent, with amazing visuals and attention to detail, filled with wonderful themes of respect, honor, strength, courage, wisdom. It transmits something of the indomitable spirit. It raises, and somehow improves you as a human being.After viewing this sequel film, I felt violated, dirty, cheap, deceived. Like I needed to cleanse myself after mentally ingesting so much toxic drivel. So I watched the first one again, and was immediately better for it."
" Positive
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,8,"I think a lot of these reviews are deluded to the thought of this type of film should be an Oscar winning masterpiece. This is an action thriller throughout and should be watched as so. Action from start to end, a satisfying and easy to follow storyline. A very enjoyable action pact film."
" Good sequel of 300 movie..
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,7,I understand the story just after watching review in tamil..i like the fight in sea with big boats..great stunts and castings...
" I could give you 300 reasons not to watch this....
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,2,"But I won't I'll just give you a few. This movie is nowhere as good as the original 300. Action wise its not great, its over the top but not in a good way. The plot is very terriable, it does't make sense and doesn't even make for high entertainment. I can't for the life of me figure out why the this other than of course the money. The first 300 had its own style this just feels like an unnecessary film that's not realy a sequel or pre sequel."
" Not too bad actually
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,8,"About 20 times better than that idiotic shoutfest Gerard butler had the audacity to make a living from...eva green is superb in this film,an great actress who doesn't get the respect she deserves"
" What should that be?
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,4,"One of the most unnecessary sequel, prequel or whatever that should be."
" Disappointing
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,1,Another lie and changing history... awful awful awful it's not even worth to watch
" IT'S ALSO BEST WAR MOVIE WITH 300 1st PART
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,10,AGAIN I'M SAYING THAT BEHALF ON 300 1st PART IS THIS MOVIE IS ALSO BEST WAR BEST AC TION AND BEST STORY ❤❤🔥🔥😍😍⚡⚡👌👌
" Shame!
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,5,"Could have been so much better, if not for some of the worst picked actors for certain parts, and because if that, shocking acting in parts too!"
" It's an Action Flick, not a Documentary
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,7,"The number of poor review saying this doent reflect history. For goodness sake, it's not based on fact, it's an action film. An escape. if you take it for what it is and you enjoyed the Green Sceeen slow motion of the original, then you will enjoy this.
Loved Eva Green in this."
" I believe the film maker roots was Greek 😁
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,1,My favourite type of move is historical & so disappointed with this one. Wouldn't recommend if you really into history.
" Impeccable cinematography
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,9,"They did an amazing job with this movie. The glaring lighting in the background, a signature theme from the first ""300"" movie, is breathtaking, and so are the slow motion sequences."
" Long and dreary CGI-fest...
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,4,"Now this simply didn't need to be made. Sullivan Stapleton (""Themistocles"") is the Atehnian general tasked with rebuffing the overwhelming forces of Xerxes as he continues with his attempts to overwhelm the Greek archipelago. Eva Green is the feisty admiral ""Artemisia"" who is leading the Persian naval assault and soon this is a war of wills between the two of them. The CGI has none of the subtlety of the first film; the script even more crass and the battle scenes interminably long - and, surprisingly, unimaginative. The storyline is all over the place - not that that really makes much difference to this cartoon-like adventure fantasy. An early outing for Jack O'Connell if you have a pause button; otherwise I'd just give this a miss..."
" Rewriting history with 21st century propaganda touch
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,1,The writer of 300 is well known as a warmonger and culturally ignorant.
" 300
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,6,"Is it a 300 prequel, sequel, or set concurrently with the events of 300? Yes. It somehow manages to be all of the above, and manages to come up with a story that leads up to the events of the original and sorta what happens afterwards as well as creating a storyline of what was happening at the same time somewhere else. It's also always fun when original actors return in cameos to reprise their roles to give further character backstory especially the ""this is madness!"" guy who manages to get a quick story arc."
" Worst lie!
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,1,"That's a biggest and worst lie I have seen in whole of my life
I'm sorry for the producers of this ridiculous show...
And just want one thing from wise people : ""PLEASE READ THE REAL HISTORY """
" 300 rise of an empire
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,5,"Even if 300 wasnt clearly a masterpiece of filmaking or action genre,it was at least enterteining as hell and fun to watch basiacly said everything that this film isnt,themistokles was completly boring and lifeless character with now develompent or personality,while we also didnt know a lot about leonidas we at least know that he has family,but this leader has none of that,also stapelton was completly unthreating or intimidating to be taken seriously,while butler killed it as leonidas,eva green is only saving grace of this film and she was nice to look at,this film is forgettable and lame sequel to a film that it didnt need it in a first place"
" Bad sequel
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,6,"A poor shadow of the real 300.
The movie wasn't to bad until a man fallow from the ship with fire and burn the entire fleet...and a horse in the middle of nothing appears to the hero and almost fly from ship to ship.
Poor dialogues and predictable scenes makes this movie a bad sequel of his great antecedent..."
" It doesn't rise to the expectations
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,6,"300: Rise of an empire period action movie directed by Noam Murro and stars Sullivan Stapleton, Eva Green, Rodrigo Santoro and Lena Headey in the lead roles.The movie is sequel to 300.The only space where movie has an edge from it's first part is the violence and bloodshed which is an integral part of any war movie.The plot of the movie doesn't hold for long and movie starts deviating from it's plot.As far as acting is concerned Eva Green steals the show and is the shining star of the movie, Sullivan Stapleton is just above average. The action sequence impresses and the movie is more violent than it's first part.There are many critics says that the movie is historically incorrect but the director should have the authority to manipulate in a fictional movie.Screenplay is slow but will never let you get bored. Climax is good.Overall a decent movie which could've been better."
" Follow up to ""300""
",2019-12-06 00:00:00,7,"Can't compare to the first ""300"" ( the new movie remake with Gerard Butler ) but nice follow up on the Gerard Butler ""300"" . Good cast, plot/storyline, cinematography and directing again, Eva Greene made this film, if you liked the ""300"" remake with Butler this film is worth a sit down and watch."
" 300: The rise and crumble.
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,5,"Such a poor, damp squib of sequel, to the groundbreaking '300'. it looks the same but quickly becomes a pallid imitation (of the original). The female adversary is pretty lame and totally unconvincing in her battle action. Also you know halfway through she is going to be involved in a heavy sex scene (but not really complaining); although the first episode did not rely on such cheap thrills or assembly line script writing. An okay film but with all considered, it's an awful sequel to a modern classic (now devalued). The rise and crushing fall!"
" 300 : Rise of an Empire
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,6,Though there was a strong effect of creativity and emotions bought down by the predecessor to cinema the sequel lacks it's affect by only creating an action film with lots of blood. Only positive in this film was how the film maker connects it with the prequel. But it still lacks the innovation the last film had.Overall - 3/5
" Blood and screams
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,5,What the hell just happened to 300 this movie is nothing a like the first sequel
" Above Average: 6.5
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,6,"The first 300 is famous for being one of the most divisive films in history, polarizing critics with its sumptuous visuals, relentless violence, and dubious script. Now, the better part of a decade later, the series is back, and it hasn't changed much at all. If you enjoyed the original, you'll probably like this one. If not, steer clear. That said, I enjoyed Rise of an Empire more than its predecessor, for two main reasons. The first is that I didn't know how it would end. Even before 300 came out, people knew about Thermopylae and the futile last stand that happened there. It made it too difficult to invest in the characters, and essentially forced me to sit drumming my fingers until their inevitable death. This was, fortunately, not the case here. The second reason is Eva Green. Best known for her breakout role in 2006's Casino Royale, her performance in Rise of an Empire ranges from terrifyingly understated to unintentionally comic, and steals the spotlight at every opportunity. But even she cannot hold up this movie by herself, since the film, for all its merits, relies on little more than its visual effects and art direction."
" Total garbage sequel
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,1,"Om its release I just ignored this sequel just
By Watching the artcover and the trailer it was clear this was gonna be a cheap imitation of the first film.
And now on Netflix i finally watched the movie.
Total worthless junk. None of the Main characters can act. None of them fits their characters. Everything Is B. Effects are B. Only computer blood. Story is the weakest trash i ever witnessed. If youre a fan of the first sword and sandal movie do not watch this!.
How could they get Eva Green to do this movie is beyond me. It was her earliest days as an actress i bet."
" my notes
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,5,"It was ok. it had its good, its awesome, its bad and its terrible. tried to be like the first one in many ways but failed miserably at it. bad writing. awesome action. meh story (1 viewing)"
" A great lie
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,1,"The whole movie is a complete lie, and none of the events described in the movie are right. For instance, queen artemisia died protecting Perspolis during the invasion of Alexander the Great."
" Shame!
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,1,I am sorry for this film because in this film show the destory my country.
" Worst movie ever!
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,2,"By far the worst movie I can remember watching ever! So many awful slow motion moves that it entirely destroys any joy one can have in watching movie. Who ever was behind slow motion in this movie did an awful job. Usually that is something one doesn't pay attention in a movie because it's subtle and unnoticable as much, added only at right timing to accent the scene but in this it's like it was used to drag the movie to last longest possible and ascenes are completely unnecessary to have that slow motion. Next and worst thing I find about is - was there really not a single actor in the world that speaks proper english accent, that you HAD to use australian speaking actor? To play a Greek? ! Who on earth gave you that god damn awful idea? This movie is a disgrace to previous 300 movie that was so incomparably better! You should had left it at first one and never did this one because it was a massive disappointment!"
" Garbage
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,3,"Quite simply the worst film ever.
The acting is atrocious, even Eva Green can't bring any relief to this woeful tale.
The action is ludicrous and lacks any of the debatable style of The 300 while the buckets of blood which are thrown around just encourages laughter.
As for the history? Not even close.
Don't watch even if it's on TV and you have nothing else to do."
" How many borscht has been spilled?

" A Good If Historically Inaccurate Movie
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,7,First off this movie had over the top blood and gore which went way too far in my opinion as I usually like gory movies but this was to extreme for me. Also there were scenes of sexual violence which were disturbing to me. That said the actors did an excellent job in their roles and the script was well written. The cinematography was excellent and the fight scenes were well choreograped. Plus on the DVD set that I watched there was a bonus disc that contained featurettes about the making of the movie and the real story about the battles and historical people depicted in the movie which are all worth watching.
" Extremly Violent Follow Up To The 300 Movie
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,7,First off this movie was very gory and bloody in the extreme as I usually like really gory movies but this was over the top even for me. Plus there were scenes of sexual violence which were disturbing to me. That said the actors did an excellent job in their roles and the script was well written. The cinematography was excellent and the special effects were outstanding. Also included in the DVD set that I watched was a bonus disc that gave more information about the movies production and the real stories about the battles depicted in the films along with the historical background of the characters which are all worth watching.
" First one was so much better
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,5,"This could have been an extended version of 300 and not the whole movie. Cgi was pretty bad and Eva Green is only good as model. Yeah, se got part of history but it wasn't well told. It is below average for me."
" EVA GREEN
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,8,"Loved it.Moreover, although many will say that I am crazy, I will say that I liked it more than the first part, and that is because, unlike the previous one, here the war is finally seen from the point of view of the Persians, (who were not as bad or cruel as they are painted in the first, just as the Greeks were not as noble or patriotic as they are painted in both films).The clichés however remain, but this time have made us feel more sympathy towards the other side, and the reason for that is mainly due to a fantastic, dark, mysterious, warlike and overwhelming Eva Green, what great success and surprise to see this actress playing the powerful Artemis.And it is that to see a woman, skipping all the ridiculous canons and norms imposed to the force to the women at that time and giving it to those those hyper-muscular macho is a real pleasure.I swear I ended up wishing that in the end she would end up beating the heavy and nasty Greeks, that I do not know about you, but that in the end all this roll of freedom and patriotism, (totally false, in the Persian army there were thousands of Greeks and Spartans exiled by their own cities and who fought for the tyrant, for the Greeks, of course, Persian), I ended up becoming unbearable.The film itself has seemed very entertaining, historically more faithful than the first, with an agile and direct rhythm that does not lead to boredom and with quite a few actors in place.
By the way, am I the only one who was saddened by the death of Artemis and the defeat of the Persians?I'm sorry, but I really can not stand the cockiness of the Spartans or the plasticized and modernized patriotism of the Athenians."
" ""I would rather die a free man than a slave!""
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,7,"Not quite a sequel to the original ""300"", and not quite a prequel either. I was kind of surprised actually that the story of ""300"" and the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. was embedded into the structure of this movie, which in it's way placed both stories within the same historical context. The thing is, if you saw ""300"", you're going to get pretty much a repeat of the same story here, at least from a stylistic viewpoint. The battle scenes are crimson and muddy with a huge emphasis on buckets of gore coming at you from all directions. The saving grace, odd to say, is the presence of a notorious villainess named Artemesia (Eva Green), the leading general of the Persian Army who brings the naval war to the Greeks, led by Themistokles (Sullivan Stapleton), who does his best to unite the city-states of Greece to meet an implacable foe. The film should well appeal to action/adventure fans who go for the blood and guts, but one wouldn't be remiss after a while to feel that enough is enough. Considering the presence of God-King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) making his presence felt from time to time, one might feel cheated by not having him engage in ultimate battle against Themistokles himself."
" Good but not fantastic ...
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,6,"They badly chose the main actor, did not fit the character well but in terms of action and argument does not disappoint."
" Just when I thought it could'nt get worse
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,1,"Hollywood and the deluded movie makers. I'm not even going to get into the 100 inaccurate historical facts the makers try to normalise in this horrendous CGI bullock. Rather grabbing the untruth about the Eastern AND Western social and traditional values in the antiques. We all know that in the ancients there were no female soldiers, warriors or even any sort of high ranked army personalities. It's a proven fact, simple. Trying to introduce two women as the generals (or whatever you'd like to call them) is simply pathetic. If you want to give roles to women in your movies, act appropriate. In the modern time women are at every possible high ranks in the army or whatever, but in the antiques, it was simply not just the case. Leave your gender equality BS for the right movies and right times."
" Totally ok if you watch it with the right mood
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,7,"Okay, this is obviously not as good as the first one. I didn't expect it to be, so I wasn't at all disappointed when all I got were amazing fight sequences, jacked dudes that deliver inspirational speeches, and an over-the-top action overall. It is worse when compared to the original, the villain isn't as good, and the epic level is downed."
" Come with low expectations and you'll be rewarded
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,7,"The first 300 movie was very good, and this one is quite ok. It gives the bigger picture for the first movie and interwoves it nicely in its plot.
The protagonist is not leonidas, although he does stand on his own ground, and the antagonist is not convincing. But the combat scenes are not bad and the general feeling of this movie complements the first one well.
If you are a fan of the first movie and want to learn more of this sudo-fictional world - lower your expectations and watch this one. You'll enjoy it. I did."
" ECSTASY OF STEEL AND FLESH
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,7,"There is nothing like epic historical fantasy to piss-off the Iranians once again. This story starts at Marathon where Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) kills King Darius (Igal Naor) wearing a costume stolen from Emperor Ming. Darius' son Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) goes on to become a ""god-king"" and getting a minor role, while looking like the incarnate of evil. Persia has Artemis I of Caria (a pale Eva Green) lead the navy against Greece where Themistocles is attempting to unite the Greek city states to defeat the invading Persians. Sparta wants to go its own way. The 300 Spartans we get to see laying on the ground dead, post battle as Xerxes proclaims victory and moves on to Athens. I guess that was my bad expecting to see the 300 do battle and that whole thing about the goat path because someone put ""300"" in the title of the film.This is the adult fantasy version of the story. There was plenty of slow motion blood splatter. They like the blood to land on the camera lens (or glass) and look suspended in the air for a while. The speeches given in the film were necessary for the production, but were completely boring. ""Freedom is her wisdom has chosen you to defend her.""There is also both male and female narration because not everyone knows butchered Greek History. This film takes liberties with the accounts of Plutarch, Herodotus, and Polyaenus. For instance, Artemis I of Caria was actually Queen of Halicarnassus and only commanded five ships. Her character is greatly multiplied in this film.Good popcorn film for adults. Nothing more.Parental Guide: 2 F-bombs. Night time distant rape. sex. nudity (Eva Green )"
" This film is foolishly false and falsifies historical events with a racist view
",2018-09-27 00:00:00,1,I just can say this is sooooo foolish And this is a disrespect for Iran's great civilization
" 6.2?
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,1,"I despair.. Either that score is lies or people have lost all sense; the film is terrible, there is barely a plot, the only thing worth watching it for is Eva Green's mesmerisingly beautiful t*ts."
" Amazing, fun, entertaining
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,10,"Eva green, amazing. Aswell as all the beautiful animation and brilliantly done fights and battles the story line is actually very good aswell as being set before, during and after the first 300 film. Just great"
" Undeserved hate for a great sequel
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,9,"First time reviewing on this site and I just wanna say this movie is actually pretty good. Although first off, if you were expecting historical accuracy from a COMIC BOOK movie sequel then you will definitely be disappointed. And it does have a story line you just actually have to pay attention to the movie. Now that that is out of the way I can actually talk about this movie. First off, this movie is EPIC! If you have seen 300 then you know what to expect. you will get blood, shirtless Greeks, violence and blood. This movie is sorta like a companion movie. This time it follows the Athenians in their own battle against the Persians. It follows Themistocles in his battles at marathon, defending the 300 by sea and then a final battle that is epic. Also you get to see a little into the Persian backstory even finding out how Xerxes became the Godking. You also have Eva Green as one of the craziest psycho chicks in film. She is crazy in her role and makes the movie worth it just by herself. You also get to see more of the themes of the first movie, mainly focusing on the themes of patriotism and standing up to tyranny since the Athenians are conducting an experiment called democracy and the Persians threaten the existence of it. you also see a huge difference between the Athenian amry and the 300, with different weapons, battle tatics and also how some of them, don't even have a helmet or shield.(Which I thought was a nice touch) but the action is great, just as crazy as the first only with naval combat at time and Greek naval combat aka RAMMING!!! And it actually is still a good story, not the most provoking or deep, but its still a tale of standing up to the tyrannic Persians( at least that is how they are in the movie) and fighting for Greece and liberty. If there was something they could have done better in this movie was that they could have done more with the Persians and go a little more with Eva Green's character. Other than that it is a fun BA movie htat looks great and gets the blood pumping. It is not as bad as people say it is, this is definitely not the worst movie of all time and it is not a bad sequel. This has everything that made the original great and more with the Persians being explored a little more and seeing more behind the scenes action in defending Greece. See it and you won't regret it."
" Not Quite
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,5,"Wherein the original had a good plot, characters and dialogue; this one suffers in all these categories. The first 30 minutes are intriguing but it soon turns into a disjointed implausible snoozer. By the end of the film, you don't care about who lives or dies but are thrilled it's over."
" Eva stop acting
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,1,"I have never seen anything so wrongly cast. 
The worst ever bad female role i have ever seen."
" Haters Be Damned
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,8,This movie is awesome. End of story. It's got everything you'd want from 300 and more. The naval warfare aspect was sweet and refreshing. This sequel does a fantastic job with cinematic continuity. Almost feels like Snyder made it himself. Well done to Murro on the direction and execution.An enjoyable sequel and a fun time at the movies!
" Forgettable
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,5,"Not much to say really, significantly worse than the first this sequel is nothing to write home about really. The story is essentially copy/pasted and slightly extended and it finishes slightly abrupt. However with fairly good comic action nodding to its roots its visuals are quite pleasing and in cases moreso than the original. Just an average film"
" Worth watching just for the action sequences
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,5,A prequel/sequel that at times parallels the original 300 movie telling the story of Greece and the fight against the invading Persian army led by a god King. The action/fighting scenes were amazing but as good as they were it made for many unbelievable moments. Not as good a 300 due to the lackluster acting. A lot of battle scenes and blood to satisfy the typical action movie lover. Beyond that there is not much to gain from this follow up to the superior original
" Feminist garbage
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,1,"The original 300 was admittedly not a movie worth mentioning, and thus my expectations were pretty low going in to see this sequel. However, that masculinity that was so admirable was gone from the sequel, and instead we get a kind of SJW motion picture in which the men are wimps and the females the 'tough guys', resulting in one of the most ridiculous feminist pieces of propaganda ever created.Ofcourse since the sequel is made in a more modern era of 'Toxic masculinity' and 'Strong female characters', the character or Artemisia ( Eva Green ) & the drastic character change of Queen Gorgo ( Lena Headey, who is also now seemingly superhuman in fighting abilities, which is something that is quite out of character for her after the original film ) were made purely to please the SJW crowd. That masculinity of the original is gone and instead every male character in the movie is a pawn that is being used by both women characters. The ridiculous shots of the sixpack abs are still there, but for some reason all these seemingly 'Manly men' are ridiculed and executed by Artemisia even though she stands a couple of feet below most of them in height, and barely weighs anything. Furthermore, her command with all the males blindly obeying her in genuine fear of her is utterly ridiculous. Why would these men fear this puny woman, it makes little sense. Eva Green is not really to blame for this, as it isn't her fault, but her role simply isn't written for a female. All the male characters are utterly useless, and this basically results in a disgusting anti-male garbage piece of feminism propaganda. Combine this with Gorgo who uses all of Sparta and its gullible and weak willed males to avenge her dead husband, and what we have here is a picture that confuses its genders in a ridiculous manner.Gerard Butler might have been miscast in the original, but there is no doubt that after witnessing Themistokles ( Sullivan Stapleton ) in the lead that this picture basically screams for his return. Stapleton has very little emotional range, and his character is a complete pushover. ( Take the 'rape' scene with Artemisia for example, what a ridiculous bunch of nonsensical women empowerment propaganda that was once again ) The 'manly' mannerisms of Leonidas are gone, and this picture sorely misses his presence, since Themistokles is barely even a presence. There is very little useful dialogue, and once again no sub text or a clear moral message, purely blind feminist entertainment. The action scenes are absolutely horrendously bad, as most of the blood coming from victims literally look even worse than in the original, with the blood looking like fake plastic with a red dye. Many of the action scenes seem like complete CGI, and not very good CGI either. The result is it looks like some kind of brainless videogame created in 1998. The grainy and colorless cinematography of the original returns, except since the sequel is mostly at sea, it is even darker than the original, which results in even few colors. The sea battles are filmed under overly artificial backdrops and lighting once again and never in these scenes do you get the idea that this world feels like it is real. Music is extremely out of place most of the time and doesn't fit in with the kind of picture this is supposed to be. Like in 300, the fighting scenes also focus solely on the main character in question, and never show what enemies are doing, because all that it is interested in is showing what a great bunch of moves the characters in question have ( Mainly Themistokles, who was a gigantic wimp, but somehow fights like a madman ). This means the fighting is only there for the sake of showing some fine choreography because we do not actually see what happens to most of the enemies ( Should take some notes from Seven Samurai (1954) on how to create MEANINGFUL fighting scenes, as every hit of the main character is followed by a cut of an enemy hitting the ground, instead of just focusing on useless choreography of a single character. )Ultimately 300: Rise of an Empire is once again a pointless movie, with nothing relevant to say, except to further shove feminism down the viewers throat, as if that wasn't happening enough already these days."
" The Boys Can't Keep Up..
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,6,"The real let down in this film is the full weak male leads.. wimp ass boring men. Poor Artemisia no wonder she wanted to wipe them out, yes, overacted & melodramatic, but dead sexy sword wealding, bow shooting chick leading an ancient Persian armada with a rock'n wardrobe - she must have been SOOO pissed off she didn't get to play with Leonidous (Gerald Butler) instead!!"
" Not as good as the original, but still entertaining.
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,6,"A feast in so many ways! Unbelievably clear, brilliant photography. Very graphic, but never ceases to amaze. The film is ultimately not as exciting or entertaining as its predecessor, but nevertheless still fascinating. Plot flaws galore, it doesn't quite made sense why Themistokles went to Artemisia's ship, as it seemed like a suicide mission, but the sex scene that subsequently followed was indeed one to behold!The film does become a bit repetitive and the slow motion overdone, but the eye candy more than compensates for this! Sullivan Stapleton makes a likable hero."
" Why oh why?
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,1,"I started watching this on Amazon Prime and turned it off as it was so rubbish. Sadly I forgot this and turned it on again some months afterward. The cinematography is clearly focused on 3D and that's the best part of it. The acting is atrocious, not that the script would help it really. On the bright side it wasn't that long!"
" Worst movie i ever saw
",2018-04-06 00:00:00,1,"The movie is exactly opposite of truths and history , super one sided battle scenes super terrible story line wants make greeks good people and hot as the persian commander has sex with a greek general, omg funniest joke in human history , i can say director even has personal problems with persians plus mental problems , if u know persians ladies will fight till their last breathes and in persian culture they never have good vision about foreigners , imagine now in a battle a persian women with that high skill and reputation even smiles on a greek lol 
i wanted to tell the director to visit change the movie genre to comedy and then i can say the movie is great."
" bad reviewers
",2017-12-31 00:00:00,9,"I have come to the conclusion by reading a lot of so called reviews that the reviewers havent a clue,or did they even watch the film or maybe its the vogue to slag an action/new film off these days, the question should be asked why bother going to see a film if you are going to bad mouth it before you have even seen it, just stay at home next time and writing rubbish"
" Sorry but as a movie in the 300 universe, no way...
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,6,"I am not a particular huge fan of the original 300, but I do like it for what it is. I'm afraid this is not up to par quality wise.I thought this was to be a sequel, but I was wrong, it's more in parallel of the original, with a bit of prequel and sequel around.I did appreciate seeing some of the original cast back, it was definitely nice, even though the movie is not about them (too bad!).This movie follows the previous one with its central characters, and unfortunately the comparison isn't good for it, and this is exactly my biggest issue.* Leonidas is replaced by Themistokles:I have no problem with Stapleton, he seems a great actor, but unfortunately his character is far less interesting. He's pretty much a good guy that cares a lot for everyone with little humor, I found it somewhat boring to watch compared to our previous lead. I understand that it represents the difference between the Athenians and the Spartans, but it doesn't really work out for me, maybe it would have with a better co-lead.* Xerxes is replaced by Artemisia:Now this really did not work. Xerxes was awesome (in limited quantity of course) whereas Artemisia not quite. There was something about her makeup that made me wonder if she was on meth or a goth or something else that did not belong... Forgetting that, her build is not of a warrior, there is no way for her to wield a sword and a shield all day like this. Why are all the guys huge but her, the best warrior of Persia, so tiny? and yet she's the only one wielding not one sword, but 2! (yes yes I understand skills... still I'd expect more a build like Ferris Hellig, especially for a 300 main character!). Some of her scenes were fine, even if not super interesting, but I felt some of her last speeches lacked feelings).* Dillos was replaced by Aeskylos:It's not that Dillos is such an awesome character in 300, but he's good enough in most of his scenes and great in his last ones. I never felt anything good about Aeskylos, this time it's probably both the character and the actor. It's like they needed Themistokles to have some discussions so they sort of forced this guy in, but he serves no real purpose.* The father and son are replaced by... another father and son! The evolution of their relationship is interestingly opposite, as again one would expect between Spartans and Athenians and that was good, but the characters are not that interesting and the boy that needs to prove his worth to his father is not that fun that we needed it. The dad is fine, I think he should have taken over Aeskylos's role and have more screen time.* The multiple Persian armies are replaced by the Persian Navy: That too was fairly boring in comparison. In the first one you never really know what will be coming next, but here it's always the same... Well it is less insulting to Persians though since it has no demons/monsters this time :)The main characters, which is what the movie is really about, are unfortunately fairly boring. The sex scene has no purpose but itself... I could understand one of the 2 characters taking part in it, but definitely not the other A few things seem to contradict between the 2 movies as well, but nothing too major. The first battle had so much blood, they even splashed it on the camera, it was annoying.All in all, nothing to remember."
" Trust is a very hard thing to regain!
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,1,"How would you feel if you found out that somebody lied to you? Would you respect a person who tells serious lies about an important thing?We all know about Alexander's invasion and conquest of Persia but have you ever heard of Xerxes' invasion and conquest of Hellas?Leonidas with many more people than just 300 tried in vain to stop the Persian army and got crushed. But why so much respect for Leonidas? Because he fought intrepidly. What would he have gotten if it happened in the modern era? He would probably have received an army commendation or something - posthumously. Get the point? Okay, he's been exaggerated!The people of Athens ran for their lives days before the Persian army reached Hellas borders. Oh, and it was the Persians who grew beards as seen on all the stone carvings remaining from ancient times not the Greeks. In the movie the Persians look like aliens, orcs, zombies and beasts!Some parts of history are musts to be read. The Greko-Persian wars is an important chapter in the history of mankind.I am so concerned about how our media are run by such illiterate thugs who show no respect to accuracy when accounting for a real event. I mean how can we trust anyone from now on?"
" Not as bad as everyone thinks
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,7,"Honestly this was entertaining to watch and had a well mounted story, yeah it wasn't historically correct, whatever, for that matter go see a documentary, honestly i found it amusing and good not deserving of the 3/10 people are giving it, 300 was a super movie and people are putting this one in a bad spot because of the shadow of the original and that's not fair, this isn't Lalaland or some utter garbage movie like that."
" Worst movie I've seen in a long while
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,1,"Saw this movie recently because I enjoyed the original 300. However, this movie was awful. So awful that I created an account to warn others. The only character in this movie that generated any resonance with the audience is Artemesia. The movie was an excuse to use 300- esque graphics without any of the story or heart. You actually root for the Persians as it was really the only story-building the movie did. You saw how Xerxes rose to power, but very little about our protagonist. As such, I found myself pitying the Persians and found the Greek characters lacking any dimensions"
" Not only insulting Persia, History But also insulting Cinema as 7th art
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,1,"I am sorry for the casts and crews of this movie, who has no dignity and personal standard but only money!.I feel sad for those of you who has uprated this movie out of illiteracy, cause you didn't even heard about Will Durant, The Story of Civilization, or never went to London museum to see Cyrus charter of human rights, The first human right document in the world......I am sorry for the ArtSad"
" Why this movie lacks of the quality of the first 300
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,4,"I would like to start by saying that, despite the fact that I study at a school where we learn ancient Greek language and literature as a subject, my main complaints as for 300: Rise of an Empire are not the numerous historical inaccuracies that this movie has.The first 300 was one of those very interesting films which is adapted from a comic book. This allowed it to have a both visual and plot-wise guide in its original graphic novel. I loved 300, certainly not because of its gore, its nudity or anything of that, but because it attempted to bring to film the comic book as it was. And, if you ask me, it succeeded in bringing a visually wonderful story with well characterized characters. What my feeling was from seeing this film, was that those who worked on it didn't understand why 300 was so good. Intead of bringing a story written with Frank Miller's style, it had no clear plot, and definitely no ending. Next to this, R rated material such as gore, violence, nudity and profanity was brought to such an extent that the film had more in common with an exploitation movie than with the previous film. 300 had some R rated content, but as much as was needed for the film. I heard too many modern profanities and points of language which simply didn't fit the situation (300 had almost no language, on the other hand). Also, I've seen simply too many gory deaths and stabbings, throat slits, decapitations, mutilations and such, which weren't strictly required. Again, 300 had only that amount of this which was required for the plot.Next to this, there were almost no such iconic and visually appealing shots such as certain scenes of the previous film, and the imponency of Xerxes which was shown in 300 was undermined by the introduction of a new female villain who apparently doesn't have to obey to a god-king.While some of the combat was well shot, I think this film should have focused on one single battle, rather than showing a series of insignificant ones. This battle could have been the battle of Salamis, which, if portrayed more accurately (just as how 300 portrayed the battle at Thermopylae) could have provided a very intriguing situation that could have lasted half of the movie. Salamis was portrayed very untruthfully in this film.The abrupt ending was the worst thing. Whereas 300 provided a satisfying ending, Rise of an Empire has a more open one. Leaving an open ending the way this film does is simply meaningless.If you are to watch some sort of exploitation action film set in Greek era, you might not find these points as valid to downrate this film. 300, on the other hand, had next to some of those elements a higher quality, due to its closeness to the original Frank Miller Graphic Novel. Rise of an Empire was almost not based on Miller's Graphic Novel, but, in addition to that, didn't have much in common with its style as well, a style that would have granted it a higher artistic value as a film."
" Dreadful
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,3,"I wonder if the makers of this rubbish, give the supposed younger audience any levels of intelligence. Boy is this bad, its even worse than that 1950's garbage, when Richard Egan starred, depicting the demise of the 300 spartans. This piece of work pretty much sums up why C G I offerings are so bad, no proper script, ridiculous story, and a complete waste of my time. Watch Eva Green in Ridley Scotts kingdom of Heaven, and tear your hair out in frustration, because she is a class act, directed by a classless clown. The action sequences are just plain stupid, and bear no resemblance to ancient sea conflict."
" Boring apart from the last action sequence!
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,6,This is one of the worst sequels ever. 300 was an iconic movie which set a landmark for upcoming action movies. I haven't seen action sequences as good as 300 in any other movie till now. This movie couldn't deliver after creating so much hype after its predecessor. I appreciate performance of Eva Green as Artemisia in this movie. This movie is all about her.We do not get to see much of Xerxes or Dilios as expected. Themistokles is no match for Leonidus. Story is weak as well compared to 300. None of the character seems impressive. Went to theater to watch an action flick but had to wait for more than an hour of boring politics s**t to finally get some good action sequences. The last scene with Lena Headey is superb! This movie is easily avoidable. I see this movie just as a boring build up for maybe something interesting that is yet to come. Hope the next one will not disappoint!
" Now You See It. Now You Don't.
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,4,"Muscle, that is.In battle scenes the Greeks are huge, solid, muscular guys. In between battles they're skinny, pampered Hollyweird actors. The difference is so striking it's absurd.The main bad guy, I'll call her Bitchocles because I can't remember her name, constantly complains her generals can't give her victory. But other than butchering all of Xerxes' advisors, so she can convince him to go to war, she shows 0 ability at strategy or warfare. How about a suggestion? How about a plan? Nah, Bitchocles would rather butcher her own men when they fail.The action isn't bad. Lots of blood flows and spatters in slo-mo, all the better to show off the in battle scene CGI muscle bodies."
" What a masterpiece!
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,10,"The first time you watch it, you may expect it to be like the first 300 movie. In fact, it is, but it's story line is developing in parallel with the first one, and is different.Because of some expectations, it's at the second watching that I've been really able to admire all the beauty and the perfection of this second story.Everything in this movie is perfect. The actors are fabulous, the costumes are beautiful, the soundtrack is marvellous, and all the work they put into the visual effects, make every shot a feast for the eyes.I mean, seriously, you could stop the movie at any frame and it would make a poster of it. It's how beautiful and perfect it is.So forget all the negative reviews, and watch it by yourself, and if possible, twice."
" Please switch off and enjoy
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,10,"Most people hopefully know the storyline is not entirely accurate (but it is based on actual events and actual people). However this movie is all about this delicious comic book style and the epicness of a long lost era.For us Greeks it also hits a nerve as a (quite idealized) depiction of what we are taught in our schoolbooks about the Persian wars. Watching a movie with the heroes of our history makes us proud and it is a very welcome positive reference to our country especially in the context of the last years.For all the 1/10 reviewers please relax, it is cinema, the great escape from reality. I'm already looking forward to the next one."
" Disappointing - Does Not Live Up To The Original
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,5,"I finally got around to watching this movie and WTF were they thinking when they created this one? It fails in every way to live up to the original film. I was expecting something completely different than this half mess. I like about one-half of this film and the other half I didn't.The story is a far cry from the first movie - it sucks, badly sucks. I really expected this follow-up to sorta pick up where the first film left off and not a half messed up prequel.What I did like was the battles and costuming... and that's about it. Most of the actors are okay but could not hold a candle to the first film. My beef with it is the story stinks for the most part.I'm rating it a 5 out of 10 because I half way liked it, and half way didn't. I would recommend the first movie but not this one.5/10"
" Origin of 300, Totally Destroyed by this..
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,1,"I really enjoy the part 1.. It makes me keep wanting to watch over and over again.. But for this 'Rise of an Empire' its totally twisted the fact and lots of loop holes in the story.. Lots of corny before battle speeches that makes me sleepy, overuse of slow motion effects,killings that makes no sense.. I really regret watching this. The greatness and inspiring 300 in my mind is ruined.. If you are going to watch this movie seriously and expect it to be as good as part 1 then trust me you are wrong. I don't even recognize this as 300 part 2.. It's just a lame movie trying to imitate 300 legacy and fail miserably. The high ratings obviously more than half are fakes.. Just go read those positive reviews.. So much loopholes. They can name the crews, actors and actress so well like a book. Wow.. And i saw one of them prompting people to buy DVDs when out. So obvious they are insiders that came here to make fake votes and reviews.. I dun even know the names of the actors and actress so well.. Hey.. Stop cheating yourselves that this was a successful movie. It is not at all.."
