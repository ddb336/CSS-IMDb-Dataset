" It's fun
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,7,Entertaining movie with its flaws but it doesn't intend to be a complex plot either.
" MEH TWO
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,2,"A meh movie. Chris Rock is usually a riot but in this he is more a small, restrained gathering.The movie can't decide if it's a love story, a comedy, a drama or a Black cultural promotion pseudo-biopic. Overly long, choppy and even tho Rock gets every famous friend he has to do a cameo, it is ultimately a failure.A mild distraction with long periods of meh."
" Don't go in expecting riotous laughs
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,7,"Clearly a personal project for writer/director/star Chris Rock, Top Five isn't quite a comedy and isn't quite a drama. It nestles snugly, firmly into the in-between, dispensing funny little slices of life alongside serious, self-searching notes about midlife insecurity and the desire to make something more of yourself. Rock basically plays himself, a longtime comedy superstar who worries that his silly wide-appeal earlier works have trapped him in a vicious cycle of self-loathing and alcoholism. His character is grounded and real, afraid to play anything for big laughs because the pressure to meet earlier comedy heights is so crippling. For the most part, it's the story of his swift rapport and burgeoning relationship with a tailing New York Times reporter (Rosario Dawson), which clicks on all cylinders. The two work so well together, it can be enjoyable just watching them interact over the inconsequential, and that's the real draw. Don't go in expecting riotous laughs; it's funny, but also sweet, and an effective stepping stone to broader subjects."
" Seriously Funny
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,10,"With a serious undertone - every comedian being approached as ""be funny for me man"" while every comedian having a dark side - this is a seriously good movie. The actors, the cameos, geez, even Adam Sandler was funny."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,5,"Well written, good dialogue. had some funny parts. was more about the story which was interesting. not my kinda movie (1 viewing)"
" I HATE HAMMY THE BEAR
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,8,"Andre Allan (Chris Rock) is a top comedian who now wants to be a serious actor. The fact is he sucks at being an actor and since he has become sober, he can't do comedy. In the days leading up to his marriage, Andre grants a long in depth interview to a NYT reporter (Rosario Dawson) who travels with him for a few days in what quickly becomes a formula film.The film is good because it is reflective of the African-American in the modern world going from rags to riches through Hollywood. Sometimes you just can't be good at everything. The top five refers to naming the top 5 rappers, a game they play during the film. The movie has a number of star cameo appearances. It has funny scenes, although not overly original.Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity."
" Actually Really Really Good
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,9,"What is refreshing about this film is that it's not yet another glossy all-politically correct Hollywood piece of garbage for pure mindless entertainment. And that is why this film divides moviegoers into two such extreme camps.The key theme and idea is fairly basic at its core - a stand-up comedian who struggles to redefine himself as e serious artist after quitting substance abuse. But the way the story is told and how the unravels is very engaging. It doesn't spoon-feed the key message to you, and you have to work just a little bit as a receptive viewer to pick up on some of the subtleties.Throughout it is packed with smart and understated humour and satire, which is probably the key reason why it doesn't hit a chord with a lot of people. But well worth it. It's raw, funny, at times crass and it all works because none of it far fetched at all! The best kind of comedy is one that is interwoven into a drama, which is exactly what this film does.On top of all that, the entire cast is pretty superb, and the acting is great. Whether Chris Rock can act or not is probably beside the point - cos he is just playing himself more or less. You can relate to and at least on some level identify with all the characters, who do a tremendous job of keeping the movie smart and witty.America, this is how movies get made elsewhere in the world!Definitely not for kids don't bother seeing it in a language other than English. But highly recommended viewing for anyone with an appreciation for good film making."
" If you have trouble sleeping, then this is the movie to watch.
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,1,"I found myself drifting off every few minutes waiting for a plot to evolve or for the story to progress, but neither eventuated in this pointless excuse for a film. Don't waste your time watching this."
" Adequate ""com"", with some ""rom""
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,6,"'Top Five' is Chris Rock's third directorial effort - and it is better than 'Head of State'! I love Rock as a stand-up comedian, but I feel like he still hasn't quite got it all together in terms of acting/directing. This is by no means a bad film - it's just not his, or anyone involved, best work. It's partially-autobiographical: comedian turns actor, cashes in on simple family-friendly films, gets pigeon-holed, tries to branch out into 'serious' films, flops. In reality, it's almost an Eddie Murphy biopic - hugely successful comedian, drug/alcohol issues, simple family-friendly films ('The Nutty Professor', 'Doctor Dolittle', 'Shrek'), then 'serious' films ('Dreamgirls', 'A Thousand Words').Andre (Rock) starts off as an unlikeable, self-obsessed celebrity, engaged to an even more unlikable reality-TV ""star"" (Union), but is interviewed by Chelsea (Dawson) for an article and lets his guard down. The two of them conversing are some of the better scenes, as Dawson is such a great disarming actress - impossible to not love. You get some (hopefully not based too much on reality) anecdotes and a few funny moments. There's room for plenty of good actors/friends-of-Rock's - Smoove, Tracy Morgan, Cedric the Entertainer, Romany Malco, Kevin Hart, Adam Sandler & Jerry Seinfeld - but none of them get enough time to do anything too funny/great.The eponymous ""top five"" is the question Rock asks others to see who their favourite rappers are - purportedly to 'test' their credibility. I wish Rock has focussed a little more on his top five attributes - being funny, multiplied by five! The film has a decent romantic angle and a good ending, but it not great, nor poor."
" Slowly gains momentum along the way
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,6,"This movie started unevenly: odd cameos and unreal moments. The longer it went, the more I cared. Rock managed to make this character an actual person in actual moments. That's when it got funny. And worth watching. Here's hoping Chris Rock builds from here."
" When persons of color decide to stop calling themselves derogatory names...
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,1,"then perhaps then, and only then, will they ever be taken serious. This is a sorry excuse of a reason to fill a video with as many uses of the word ""n/gg*"" as possible. This movie has maybe, maybe, 2 funny moments. Not laugh out loud funny and not funny ha ha either. Funny in making you smile. That's it. It also is very obvious a video to provide as many ""famous"" persons of color some Christmas money. When anyone belittles themselves for some pocket change then they don't even rank as high as a pro. I simply do not, and never will, understand the use of the word ""n/gg*"" over and over and over again. Has it not dawned on them that it's becoming as common as ending a fortune cookie reading with the phrase ""in bed"". It's laughable. Do all of yourselves a favor - believe the 1 star reviews. They are accurate. The 1 star reviewer is not being paid by the studio or producer who made the video, they're not family members of persons involved in the video, and they're not in the movie writing fake 8-10 star reviews. They're doing their best to warn you. In other words - move along there's nothing to see here."
" Even if it was funny in original, all humor was lost in translation
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,1,"In short, it was the worst comedy I watched within last three years. Now, to be honest, I am not a native speaker (as you can easily guess reading this review), so I watched it in Polish, so it could be that indeed in original there were some funny bits. It may be also that there is, as some people say, chemistry in original. But it was all lost in the translation. It all feel fake, terribly boring, with few bits thrown it to justify calling this... thing... a comedy.But I do not think it all can be blamed on translation. I've watched dozens of French, English, Russian, Czech and even Chinese comedies and I laughed. Here... I just kept looking at the watch to see how much it is left.Awful. Toxic. Avoid it."
