" Outstanding and definitive bio-documentary about Kurt Cobain
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,8,"""Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck"" (2015 release; 129 min.) is a documentary about the life and times of Kurt Cobain. As the movie opens, we are informed the film is based on ""audio and video, drawing, writings, and other materials provided by the Cobain family"". After a brief comment from Cobain's sister and mom, we then go back in time to the 1960s when he had his family were living in Aberdeen, Washington. ""Life was good"", comments his mom. However, as Cobain reaches his teenage years, he becomes more and more restless and rebellious... At this point we are a good 10 min. into the movie.Couple of comments: this documentary was directed by Oscar-nominated and Emmy-winning director Brett Morgen. In other words, no slouch. Here he takes on the immensely complicated job of bringing a truthful and respectful portrait of Kurt Cobain. Please note that the film was executive-produced by Frances Bean Kobain (22-23 yrs old at the time). And let's be very clear about one other thing: this is NOT a documentary about Nirvana, although obviously the band features prominently. The documentary's first half is pretty much flawless as we look at Kurt's upbringing, what drove him to do what he did, and how he ends up in arguably the world's most famous band. The film makers interview TONS of people, including family, friends, fellow musicians, etc. The film also uses animation fairly extensively to illustrate things of which there is audio but no video. Inevitably, the second half of this documentary cannot reach the same levels as we get extensive coverage of Courtney Love and of course Kurt's heroin addiction. But in the end, not only is this a riveting documentary about Kurt Kobain, but it also now is a nice time capsule of the 80s and early 90s.I caught ""Kurt Cobain: Montage of Hack"" on HBO On Demand the other day. Not sure why I had never seen it before. Better late than not. It blows the mind that this coming April will already mark the 27th anniversary of Kurt's suicide. Equally astonishing, Frances Dean Cobain will turn 30 yrs old next year. 30!!!!! In the meantime, if you have any interest in one of the biggest rock stars of the late 80s/early 90s, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion."
" are you here for graphics or accuracy?
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,5,"I was hesitant on writing this review. I'm upset it took me so long to actually watch this ""documentary"". From the beginning, the sweet home videos of a young Kurt are sweet and understandable from the late 1960s, early 1970s. As the story unfolds of what is said to be an accurate look into Cobain's life and hardships, it seems sincere. But as the film rolls on, I started to question if this was really something the late Kurt Cobain would approve of.The graphics and visuals of this film are absolutely stunning and beautiful in a dark and twisted kind of way. (which is mainly why I gave 5 stars) The animations were quite impressive and gave a more modernized look into how Cobain might have been feeling throughout his lifetime. But I do feel this film tries extremely hard to show its viewers how depressed and dark his mind was. It almost feels like the film is trying to convince and maybe even force its viewers to see that Kurt Cobain was doomed from the start. The interviews that are included in the film as some of Kurt's closest family and friends (including Courtney Love) are iffy in my opinion. The interview with Krist Novoselic almost seems like there's more he wants to say about his friend but maybe wasn't allowed or it possibly could have been cut from the film itself in order to keep the ""dark and depressing"" vibe the director wanted to portray of Cobain. It seems as though there's a lot more to the story than what's being televised in this documentary.Again this review is solely based on my opinion and how I took the film. If you aren't a huge Nirvana fan than this film might seem like an amazing and sad depiction of the life of Kurt Cobain. If you are a huge fan of Cobain's work, as well as Nirvana, you might question the accuracy of this film. The only question I have left is, ""if Kurt was here with us still, would he approve of this?"" And in my opinion, I think he would be highly disappointed. Decide for yourself."
" SO INTIMATE AND DEEP
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,8,"Really simple but also wild and crude, just like Kurt...the montage is very intimate and it seems to be there, with Kurt, until the very end of his life: you can see his decline and human drama, but you just can't do anything to help him and save his life"
" Kurt never died.
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,5,"It was enjoying, captivating, and insightful to see never before seen voice recordings and video of Kurt.I did feel like the entire production was through the perspective of his widow, Courtney Love, rather than a having multi perspective lens approach.I also feel like it didn't portray Kurt as a human being entirely. It focused a lot on the darkness of his struggles, but not enough on the joys and happiness that he experienced and radiated.On another note, I feel it didn't focus ENOUGH on the darkness. The documentary ends in November 1993 on the night of Nirvana's legendary ""MTV Unplugged"" live concert in New York City. It does not cover anything in the months afterwards leading up to his death, which I feel would've been essential to cover if you wanted to truly validate his pain. The silver lining in the ending was that the song they chose to close off the documentary, and hence that telling of Kurt's story, was ""Where Did You Sleep Last Night?,"" which is, in my emotional experience, a haunting, but also oddly heartwarming and comforting song about despair as well as so many other emotions that words can't express.The animation WAS GODLIKE! If it was just the annotation, I'd give this picture a 10/10. But why wasn't their any Dave Grohl? He was a key part of Kurt's life and legacy and the fact that they didn't have any interviews with him is outrageous.Kurt never really died."
" Not able to judge the movie completely as I don't know all about Kurt Cobain
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,7,I sure love his music but was unware of the personal side of his. Read only what was being printed in magazines and stuffs. I kind of liked the documentary as it shows what is not being displayed in public.
" Skip this. Watch Soaked in Bleach instead.
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,3,"If you're a fan this is more filler than anything else but if you want to get a deeper more intimate look at KC, watch Soaked in Bleach."
" Intimate and real view of a troubled man.
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,9,"I haven't seen every single Kyrt Cibain documentary out there but I've seen enough to say that this is the best film about the Nirvana singer/songwriter out there. It is very told from his perspective, as much as it could be because he is not around to tell his own story. But through his own written words and interviews. This documentary is about Kurt Cobain, not the death of Kurt Cobain. It ranges from childhood to his suicide yes, but the focus is the man's life, not his death. There are interviews with his family, his old girlfriend Nirvana bandmate Krist Novoselic. David Grohl is completely missing, it seems like he did have time to be part of the film. It does feel like the film could have used his presence. But the film focuses on Kurt as a child and teenager looking to be loved and accepted. The great thing is that director Brett Morgen doesn't make this into a documentary about a myth or rock legend. He gives us an interesting, intimate look at his subject. The focus is also on the music he created without resorting to hagiography. The other documentaries I've seen usually want to focus on how he died, and whether or not Courney Love conspired to have Kurt killed. This film was produced with the cooperation with Love and Frances, Kurt's daughter so it does not go into conspiracy theory stuff. The great thing is that is tries to show Kurt as a human being, not a rock myth.Great documentary.Grade: A-"
" Powerful in many good, and many bad, ways
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,7,"An uncomfortably close look at the private life of Kurt Cobain, short-term rock superstar and unwilling voice of a disgruntled generation. In the decades since his untimely suicide, Cobain's become an almost mythical figure, which isn't to say he was anything less at the height of his mid-90s popularity. To that end, it can be useful to ground his legacy in this way: intimate home video footage shows him unguarded behind closed doors, but also captures his steady state of mental decay. Where there's a gap in his video history between childhood (and it's heartbreaking to watch this happy little boy, knowing what tragedies his life held in store) and early adulthood, journal entries, artwork and beautiful animated segments keep the narrative moving. Clearly he was hanging on by a thread for longer than most could manage, pushed into a pit of despair by a bleak combination of abandonment, physical frailty, intense media scrutiny and constant, desperate drug abuse. It's not the Cobain many of us might want to see, or to believe in, but it feels so close to the truth that I could almost feel his breath on me. As an extreme close-up on one of my era's biggest names it's significant, with a killer soundtrack of course, and unexpectedly real. It frequently feels invasive, though, especially in the interviews with his parents (his stepmother's continuous, awkward smile is particularly unnerving) and I'm not sure I'm totally okay with the way it made me feel."
" Lame!
",2020-02-28 00:00:00,2,"I've read every book out there on Kurt Cobain and Nirvana. I've also seen every movie, documentary or YouTube clip on the subject. I was very excited for this movie.The first half was great. It was a chance to see his family and get a good look into his upbringing. I am amazed at how much he looks like his dad. They have the same hypnotizing eyes. As soon as Courtney Love comes into the scene, the entire movie changes. The main objective seems to be to make Kurt look like some degenerate druggie loser and Courtney is this supportive housewife. Haha! And of course, she manages to sneak several shots of her nasty salami sized nipples into the movie. Not sure how that has any relevance, but ok Courtney. She is the epitomy of a skank. Basically it shows them rolling around with scabs all over their faces, shooting up and basically being terrible parents to Frances Bean. She is the real victim in all of this if you ask me. This movie basically just made Kurt look really unstable, distant, addicted and suicidal. No doubt that Courtney's agenda was to somehow prove that by violating his privacy and showing his diaries, the director and Courtney can come up with their most convenient interpretation of this genius. I hated this movie!"
" Pitty
",2020-01-14 00:00:00,2,"Well watch it but know that it has lots of misleading and false information, but at least you can see what kind of person Courtney is.
But after that definitely watch soaked with bleach and you will understand what I am talking about."
" Get your information elsewhere.
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,5,"An overly long and indulgent disappointment of a rock doc that brings nothing new to the party. Much is left out with gaps filled in by inexplicable meandering 'art'. Be very suspicious of 'officialy sanctioned' films, especially those that miss out key figures, white wash others and look like they were thrown together."
" Great documentary if your a fan of Kurt
",2019-08-20 00:00:00,8,Loved seeing Kurt evolve into a rockstar..I had a similar childhood so I could relate..what a way to express your demons..he was beyond talented..his music will live forever as well as his name..to die so young on top of the world..all I can say is..its too bad he met trash bag Courtney..he was happy towards the end..she was cheating and if not for her he'd probably still be here. Now she's 150mil richer and has fame..but only because of him..without him she was nothing..what an amazing soul he was
" singular voice
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,8,"This HBO documentary on Kurt Cobain has contribution from almost everyone around him. It uses his art work, his music, and his voice to peer into his inner self. It has some of his family, an old girlfriend, and Krist Novoselic. With Dave Grohl obviously missing, I assumed that Courtney Love would do the same. To his credit, Dave has always claim to be ignorant while avoiding discussions of Nirvana. I'm surprised that Love actually shows up to tell her side. It's not a completely successful spin job but she's not one to deny her drug use. It's a portrait of a loving family. It does give an interesting explanation of his OD. I knew about his medical issues but this blames even his heroin addiction on that. Some of the coddling is not helpful but it does expose these inner relationships indirectly. The guy has limited family influence and Love is not the most stable of people. I do find the former girlfriend informative. Actually, I found everything after Teen Spirit rather anti-climatic until Love shows up. It's a loving documentary about an energetic voice rebelling against the world and finding an audience which yearned for that voice."
" PROPAGANDA from Love?
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,1,"This is reeks as a paid Love coverpiece painting Kurt as volatile and suicide-prone at the drop of a hat. Watch ""Soaked in Bleach"" for some actual facts. I never trusted that schemer and smelled a rat from day one. I can't wait for her to pay for her crimes or to be exonerated with more facts to the contrary. At this point, she is highly suspect and everyone knows it."
" Why it works
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,9,"A lot of people were dissatisfied with this film because they do not know what a documentary is. This film brilliantly done by Morgen, shows rare home videos of Cobain in a new light. It is like watching his short life through a time capsule. I wish there was more of it, as everyone knows Kurt was so elusive. I believe if he was married to someone different, we would have had more information and possibly he would be alive today. Those fans that actually read books on Cobain would appreciate this film more."
" Great documentary on a rock icon
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,8,"The life of Kurt Cobain, frontman for Nirvana and the voice of a generation. Shows his history and the forces that shaped him, and destroyed him.Great documentary, written and directed by Brett Morgen who also gave us Crossfire Hurricane (the Rolling Stones documentary) and The Kid Stays in the Picture (the Robert Evans story). Details well Kurt Cobain's life story, from birth to death, his motivations and demons. Insightful interviews with people who knew Cobain best. (Interestingly - no Dave Grohl interview). Most importantly the film goes to great lengths to show his genius and his self-destructive streak and how these two were a package deal. Morgen uses Cobain's own poetry, song lyrics and random writings plus animated imagery to show how dark and tortured his mind was. Maybe too great a length - much of the imagery just feels self-indulgent and serves as padding. It also ruins the flow of the film at times, as instead of moving to the next event or stage, you get bogged down with imagery reminding us of elements of Cobain's personality we already knew about.Quite emotional at times. Through use of footage from his childhood we see the innocence and life lost."
" The best Kurt Cobain Documentary yet!
",2017-11-28 00:00:00,8,"I think this piece of work being produced by Frances Bean Cobain is the best film I have seen on Kurt yet. It really shows how different he was, how Courtney seemed to be the downfall of it all in my opinion. I love the illustrations along with his recorded audio. Kurt to this day is such an iconic rock star but remains such a mystery. Krist (Nirvana bass player) really gives some intuitive insight too. My only griped is that Dave Grohl (Drummer of Nirvana) was not in interviewed. Kurt was such an influential piece of the grunge sound and really the face of it all. A must watch!"
" Unsatisfactory - but not surprisingly - ""authorised version""
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,3,"I watched this ""documentary"" without any preconceived ideas about Cobain and Nirvana. I know their music and about Cobain's death, but I followed their story from a distance. The documentary is unsatisfactory, mostly because of the uneven pace, the length and the feeling that the people involved just tried to justify themselves.The story stars slow, with some sweet (and heartbreaking) footage of baby Kurt, interspersed with interviews with his mother, father and stepmother. I knew little about Cobain's life, but I had the impression the three of them tried to justify their actions even before they mentioned that in his teenage years Kurt was shipped back and forward in his family circle, because he was ""difficult"". His dad and stepmother looked weird, while his mother looked like an older version of Courtney Love (not a compliment).The story includes animated parts of Kurt's journals, photos, artwork, home movies and even some animated ""reconstruction"" of moments in Kurt's life.The technique is interesting, but there is way too much of it, especially the animated journal, showing the handwritten words forming very quickly. It is a non-stop struggle trying to read the text. Also, most of Cobain's artwork is quite violent and depressing.When it reaches the point of Cobain living with girlfriend Tracy and then forming Nirvana, the pace of the story changes. Enter Courtney Love and the rest is basically about her. We're shown plenty of home movies, with the allegedly happy couple in various stages of undress, looking filthy and living in squalor. Then more footage with baby Frances, in the same settings and nudity, with an increasingly emaciated Cobain and Love showing her tits. As mentioned by another reviewer, that was totally irrelevant, since I wanted to know Cobain's story and cared nothing about Love's tits.With the hijack of Courtney Love, the story takes a turn for the worse and seems to drag on forever. Love also does a lot of justifying, especially about the notorious Vanity Fair interview. She admits to using heroin while pregnant, as if it is perfectly normal. Dave Grohl is not interviewed, while Novoselic gives a couple of anodyne statements. The end is quite abrupt and leaves out the final weeks. I guess a touchy topic for the widow.Whatever happened, Cobain seemed sensitive, artistic and fragile man, certainly not a happy guy. He had the misfortune of growing up in a chaotic family and falling for the wrong woman. Some say that life is the narrative we tell ourselves about the events that happened to us. Unfortunately Cobain told himself a sad, violent and ultimately tragic story."
" Montage of Dreck
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,1,"If you knew nothing about Kurt Cobain beforehand, I can see how you would think this documentary is amazing. I found it to be a very controlled and contrived piece of work. Aside from Buzz Osborne's criticisms of the film, the interviewees are obviously just covering their asses. The wealth of biographies and films that have preceded this one painted Kurt's biological mother, Wendy O'Connor, as a cruel and self-centered woman, but in Montage of Heck she's given the chance to whitewash her history and portray herself as a loving, doting mother. And then there's Courtney Love's ridiculous assertion that she only *thought* about cheating on him and he read her mind and overdosed because of it. Speaking of Courtney, the second half of the film is dedicated entirely to her marriage to Kurt. Despite accounts of their vicious fights from friends, this entire segment is showing videos of them being silly and playful. I'm sure they had some happy times together, but this is only telling half of the story.Morgen focuses on diary passages that suggest Cobain was suicidal, often lingering on them with ominous music as if to suggest that he was gloomy and tortured and that his suicide was an inevitability. This is kind of a lazy and stereotypical approach to take, especially in a film that is supposed to dispel the myth of his public persona. For the same reason, it seemed inappropriate to include the ""retarded girl"" story without making it clear (enough, at least to me) that this was part of Kurt's story-telling and not an actual event."
" The Last Great Hero of Rock and Roll
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,10,"I almost never believe the hype about movies like this. But this Kurt Cobain documentary really is as brilliant and innovative as everyone says that it is. I've never seen anything like it!The moment the story starts, it seems real and fresh. Hearing the Everly Brothers and seeing Cobain home movies of Aberdeen in the early Sixties captured a mood, a moment of promise. It seemed like a miracle was going to happen. And Kurt Cobain was that miracle. I loved the way the story began with such hope, and the way the notebooks and paintings Kurt Cobain compiled came to life. The energy and excitement that is entirely missing from Gus Van San't exercise in slumming necrophilia, LAST DAYS, was really crackling all around in the middle part of this movie. I could have done without some of the animated story sequences, though. Having a ""generic"" teenage Kurt bragging about hooking up with a mentally challenged girl, just seemed sort of heavy handed and obvious. This was a guy who would tell any lie just to make the world he came from seem even more disgusting than it really was. But the sequences where he's compiling lists of band names, lists of great punk rock tracks, and lists of ""things the band needs to do"" were not only illuminating, they were inspiring. The last half hour was pretty depressing. Whereas in the early scenes the Cobain family are frank, modest, and courageous, the people from Kurt's famous period are obviously covering their own behinds and revealing just what they want to reveal. The home movies of Kurt, Courtney, and the baby were touching, in a way, but on some level I think they were staged. (That'll cost me some helpful votes, but I just can't help saying what I feel! And this movie made me feel a lot of things.)This is certainly the best documentary I've ever seen about a rock star. There probably won't be many more, either."
