" Reality
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,10,One of the best romance drama in hindi. Made on complications of today's generation youth with comedy. Really it deserves a 10 Stars
" Much better than the first part and full on entertainment.
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,9,"Even though it has a similar style of first part, this story line is much more entertaining and much more realistic. And the cast does a wonderful job."
" Almost As Good As The First One
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,6,"I wasn't quite sure whether this one would work as well as the first movie, since two of the main male actors have been replaced and the audience is familiar with the story-telling, but I was happy to note that this movie worked almost just as well. The two new faces made their roles their own and didn't really give me much chance to miss Liquid and Chaudhary. Chauka and Thakur were so much fun and had their own personalities that led me to root for them too.The movie was fun although the music could have been better. My one big problem with Luv Ranjan movies is that the female leads are all shown negatively. Just one time, I wish he would have a female character not as air-headed or annoying. Moving on to the acting, all three male leads were great. Sunny and Omkar filled the shoes of their characters and Kartik was again fantastic, especially in his 5 minute long monologue. The girls were okay, although their characters were pretty vapid. Overall, the movie was entertaining and a fun watch."

" Who makes such garbage ? Women Hate movies
",2018-06-05 00:00:00,1,It is utter crap ! Actress who works in such film are degraded and shown such poor light I wonder why they are choosing such horrible movies. It is just busy taking jab on women. Full of sexist joke and women hate.
