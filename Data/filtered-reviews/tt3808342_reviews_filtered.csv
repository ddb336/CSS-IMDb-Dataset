" Tears in my eyes
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,10,What to say I guess you understand by the title My condolence to all the victims of holocaust
" one of my favourite films of 2016
",2020-11-26 00:00:00,10,I really enjoyed this movie it was quite powerful and tense I liked the way it was shot in a 4:3 layout I liked the character of Saul he was a really strong character and the story was also great so I would definitely recommend this movie it was fab and exciting.
" Just plain and simple BAD!
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,1,"A sensitive topic like the Shoah needs to be dealt with carefully, since a film based on it is not only an artistic expression but it also serves to chronicle the facts and educate the masses; it is a huge responsibility on the shoulders of everyone involved in the making of the film.
Instead of realizing this, the director has chosen to simply concentrate on a direction style that presumably seems new and different to him.
Very little dialogue, bad cinematography with a greater part of the film only showing the back of Saul's head as he runs around and the camera jerks around with him, the background blurred- all just serve to attempt to dilute the unspeakable horrors of the Shoah instead of trying to portray the facts accurately but sensitively.
This movie has been inevitably compared to The Grey Zone and I'd recommend the latter to the former any day even though it contains some exaggerations like the Sonderkommandos being given proper feasts everyday! It still does a much better job of explaining the background and can be watched even by people who have no prior in depth knowledge of the Shoah!
In conclusion, you're better off NOT wasting time over this movie!"
" Absolutely worth your time.
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,9,Son of Saul is a powerful reminder that things can get bad awfully quick if we're not paying attention.
" A poignant and personal encounter with a man and his persistence
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,9,"A poignant and personal encounter with a Hungarian Jewish man in a concentration camp obsessed with giving a proper burial to a boy. Rendered with superb acting, costumes, sound system, and cinematography, Son of Saul is a piece of art. The film explores themes of dogged persistence of an inmate in the face of adversity, the cruel treatment imposed by soldiers, and the dehumanizing nature of camps. The film also explores, and beautifully, the value of tradition for the main character, Aslünder Saul, as he undertakes a dangerous path. Among its highlights, the film's extensive use of closeups makes this a truly intimate journey with Saul's process, redemption, and courage. Besides, it is a one-of-a-kind feature-film on concentration camps making explicit each step of a laborer while still giving voice, though in the background, to the brutalities of life and death in a camp. Certainly, the viewer must expect an encounter with great pain, with nudity, and with a large number of cruelties and deaths. However, the film is worth the bearing, and a deserving work for an academic award for best foreign-language film."
" An incredible and powerful film to experience
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,9,"Saul is a Jewish prisoner (Géza Röhrig) works as a 'sonderkommando' at Auschwitz-Birkenau Death Camp and is a part of the team that assists in organising Jewish prisoners before they are gassed and to sought through their clothes during the gassing process. When a young boy momentarily survives a gassing and is removed from the death chamber he is smothered by an SS doctor (Sándor Zsótér). Saul claims the boy is his own and risks his own life in trying to have the boy buried.The majority of the film is seen through Mátyás Erdély's close-up camera movements of Saul or the back of his head and are therefore given an as near as possible POV of Saul's life in the camp doing this unspeakable work, while most of the digetic sound of everything else going on and the barking SS orders taking place off-screen to some great and powerful effect. There is no sense of sensationalism or exploitation in the camera or the direction, which would in effect reduce the horrors that went on in the camps.The plot is simple, but captivating with the details well shown."
" Intense!
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,7,Great movie althoug it has some very intense moments which are almost unbearable to watch. Great acting work and the technics used during filming gives you the impression that you're very close to the main character.
" Son of Saul - 80
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,8,"""Son of Saul"" a close, Intensive, exciting and sometimes confusing movie, a throw into a surreal nightmare that you know is true. And most things happend with an awesome soundscape and with a very raw and disturbing picture.But it never gets totally involving, I have a hard time understanding the character's motivation. The perspective of fighting for something human in the inhumane environment doesnt make sense to me, feels quite silly actually. Nor does it ever become completely authentic, it feels very much like a reconstruction of an concentration camp, which is what it is."
" Wanted to appreciate, but just doesn't draw you in
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,5,"First the 4.3 perspective I found annoying, I'm not sure if the purpose was to make the film claustrophobic, but either way it doesn't work for me.Secondly, although there was many aspects of the film I liked, overall it just seemed really unrealistic as Saul can seemingly just wonder around from one place to another in a Nazi death camp. I think in reality he would of been shot in the first 10 minutes.Thirdly and lastly, the over the head camera view I just couldn't get on with."
" One of the great Holocaust movies
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,10,"Well, that was cheery.Alright, it's hard to imagine many Holocaust movies being fun, but this one so effectively creates the subjective reality of one man's need to do one thing right in the middle of a near literal Hell on Earth. Every piece of the film is designed to enhance the audience's immersion into this world, and it's almost entirely done in closeup without seeing much of the horrors of the death camp directly.In Nazi death camps there were a group of prisoners called the Sonderkommando who helped guide the new prisoners in, disrobed them, piled up their possessions, cleaned the gas chambers, and helped feed the fires of the crematoriums. Saul, our main character, is one of the Sonderkommando, and the way the director, László Nemes, the first time Hungarian director, choses to follow him is kind of brilliant. As I wrote, nearly the whole film is done in close up with a very shallow depth of focus. We follow Saul, often from the back, only barely able to discern the bodies, mud, and death that surrounds him, but it implies how Saul survives in his day to day life. He can't focus on the people he's helping to marshal into the gas chambers. He's inward facing, just doing what he has to do in order to avoid the gas chamber himself. The film sells that to the audience through that shallow depth of field so that we know what's going on, but we're not focusing on it. It's such a great way to film the particular story.Saul, as he says late in the film, doesn't consider him or any of the other Sonderkommando to be alive. They're already dead, but something changes within him when he sees a small boy survive the gas chamber only to be suffocated by the Nazi doctor. Saul clings to this boy's body, begging the prisoner doctor to help him preserve the body from the furnace so that he can bury it properly. The movie is Saul's day and a half long quest to find a rabbi to say the Kaddish and give this boy a proper burial (which is apparently not necessary for a proper Jewish burial, but what matters is Saul's quest to make it happen, not the specifics of the ritual). He goes from rabbi to rabbi in the camp among the Sonderkommando, all of whom are hiding their status as rabbi out of fear of the Nazis. When Saul approaches one he doesn't know, the rabbi, realizing that others know he's a rabbi, immediately tries to drown himself.And why go through all of this? As Saul does this, the other Sonderkommando are planning an insurrection against the Nazi prison guards, a plan that Saul gets forced into contributing to when he retrieves gunpowder from one of the women sorting through the possessions of the victims of the gas chambers. Should he be concerned with the burial of a boy already dead or more concerned with helping his fellow living Jews find a way to survive? As he says, he thinks they're all already dead, so he wants to do one thing right. I don't think the movie has a real answer for which way he should have gone because Saul isn't following the correct procedure for the burial on the one hand and the insurrection has little to no chance of any sort of success on the other. He's in the middle of Hell with no good choices, and he chooses to do one small thing he can do.One thread that runs through the film is that Saul calls the boy his son. I didn't think that the boy was his son at all, but reading up on the film afterwards I saw that early drafts of the film (which don't count, only the final product counts) made it explicit that it actually was his son. I prefer the reading that the boy is just some boy and that Saul desperately needs to do something good before the Nazis liquidate the current crop of Sonderkommando and he loses all chance of doing anything right again. So, while Saul insists to his fellow Sonderkommando that the boy is his son, no one believes him and the movie never gives a solid answer. I chose my interpretation there.This movie is harsh and ugly in all the best ways. It puts the audience right in the middle of the reality of the death camps without ever breaking from its method for aesthetic or plot reasons. The central performance by Géza Röhrig is understated, haunting, and perfect for the part of Saul. I loved this film. It is one of the great Holocaust films."
" Too much of everything
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,1,"Did not like it: camera standpoint, chaotic plot, strange end....
I am a big WO2 film lover, appreciate drama, understand the need for realistic filming. But this is too strange for me."
" Freedom
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,8,"The movie deliberately obscures the bloody and cruel violent acts in the immediate vicinity, but conveys invisible events through his voice. The shaking picture is like a personal experience of entering hell. This real feeling makes the audience more deeply impressed with the cruelty. Although there are some coincident plots in this story, it is more humane from the perspective of reflective war. We experience the painful, desperate, and oppressive days in history from the long and cumbersome character life scenes. The little boy who fled at the end of the movie seems to be pinning Thor's spirit. He represents love, hope and freedom."
" UNIQUE
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,10,"Unique style of intense hell.
Brilliant way to show how was the way jews was extermined in a claustrophobia camera movement,"
" Bad camera effects
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,5,"Camera and efects are really amateur level, blurs exaggerated. Short Story and 1.4h duration."
" Disappointment
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,3,Filming technique is brilliant but not suitable for such a movie. Story is very weak and nonsense with all respect to war victims and pains lived at wwii. It is totally understandable under such circumstances dialogs are not very picky and loud. But with out dialog and with this camera view movie is not catchy.
" It isn't fun, but it's essential.
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,8,"'Son Of Saul (2015)' is powerful, the perfect example of an 'arty' technique complimenting narrative. The movie is shot entirely from the eponymous prisoner's perspective - on his face, over his shoulder or, sometimes, through his eyes - and anything he isn't paying direct attention to is out of focus. That's fitting for a few reasons, the most major being that, once the plot gets under way, Saul is of singular vision, intent on completing the mission he has assigned himself no matter the cost. The technique also makes things incredibly claustrophobic, aptly portraying the sheer mind-boggling madness of the horrific situations it depicts. It's set inside a Nazi concentration camp and, although they're portrayed discreetly, the atrocities it depicts really are upsetting. It feels like vital cinema, a story with a purpose (even if that purpose isn't always clear). It's also just staggeringly accomplished, with loads of long takes chock full of background extras and complex yet believable choreography. This never gets in the way of the story - in fact, you may not even notice it - because everything just feels so grounded, so emergent, so real. It isn't a fun experience, but it's an essential one. 8/10"

" recreating the holocaust, resurrecting God
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,8,"Jean Luc Godard criticised film for having averted the holocaust in the 20th century. Whether or not director László Nemes heard this is remained to be known. Whatever the inspiration for this film, thank God the inspiration came. Ironically this is the central tenet of the film. God.
Nietzsche hailed the death of Gods toward the latter part of the 19th century. Scholars are happy to agree that this was in ways a conscious or not prediction of the atrocities that would fall upon mankind in the early 20th century.
The holocaust is and rightly so one of the topics and events most associated with the Nazis. The Son of Saul has ventured into this event with such bravery and humility that one would be forgiven for assuming that the film was a piece of lost footage. Salvaged from the pits of a grave. Aside from the colour of the film and the clear aesthetically driven shots at times, this movie is to the bone, so much that it feels like a documentary.
As students of the world we are taught about the death camps that the Nazi's created and occasionally are exposed to the footage filmed by journalists and soldiers who liberated camps. Liberated. The word seems so unjust. One of the many achievements of this film is that liberation, if possible, is not through the opening of gates, but through the opening of hearts. This is the story. This is Saul.This film is a meditation on God or rather the death of God. Shown by the central plot device which sees the protagonist, Saul, desperately and unwaveringly seek a place of burial for a boy who has been murdered by a doctor. This man merely wants to recognise the humanity of this boy, which ultimately helps us meditate on perhaps this what religions point toward, us. The divinity of life is life itself. It's ironic that Judaism (one of the oldest extant religions) is the group which finds itself tested and scrutinised in the ghastliest manner by these self-proclaimed rulers of things. Ultimately one can't help but think Saul in burying this child is trying to resurrect God, to resurrect life in a place where he seems to have been abandoned.The Nazi's have no God. Hitler placed at the zenith of the human psyche oversees morality. Like a new-born God, one gets the feeling from Son of Saul that Hitler recognised his reign would be mortal and hence his frenetic evil was a result of temporal cognisance.Saul is part of the Sonderkommando, a group of Jewish prisoners who were enslaved by the Nazis. Forced to coerce other Jews into the gas chambers. More, they were forced to clear the bodies of their families, friends and fellow brothers and sisters from the chambers. In this we witness the industrialised nature of the Nazi killing machine. One may read about the intricacies of death camps like Auschwitz, Treblinka and Belzec but this film brings it to life, or rather, to death. Somehow the filmmakers have managed to squeeze the nauseous smells and claustrophobia through the lens onto the screen. It is in scenes like these where bodies are just pushed around like pieces of meat that we are faced to encounter what Nietzsche may have heralded.This is not to suggest it was the filmmaker's intent, but one cannot escape it. We witness the screams of women and children who witness the executions of their naked neighbours only metres ahead. One is forced to find themselves appreciating that the reason as a society we may so often overlook this topic, genocide, is because it's too much to comprehend. The mind somehow protects itself from such evil in order so that it does not freeze via some vicarious PTSD. Son of Saul ignores this via breath-taking acting and filming. Whilst most of the characters are nameless, this fact adds humanity to them. It takes away one less layer of social abstractness so that we can empathise.The cinematography by Matyas Erdely is wonderful. Often the peripheries of shots are out of focus which adds to the chaos of the place. It helps us focus on Saul's focus. Doing so without sacrificing the perpetual hell that occupants of death camps found themselves in.
As stated earlier, this film is a meditation on God. Often, we are forced to believe God is a man in the sky. László Nemes questions this and burrows the film beneath the allegorical veneer of religious stories and tries to reflect on the omniscience of God. That being, that God is immanent. God is us. It is up to us to create heaven, as we now know that it is us who creates hell."
" Words cannot describe ..........
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,7,"It's a well made film, the close cropped shots work really well. All the atrocities are off camera or on the edge of the frame.I have deliberately not gone into detail about the subject matter, it is about the holocaust and it is pretty graphic.It's worth seeing, but I can't say it's enjoyable able in any way"
" Man and animal
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,9,"How can you live with a death sentence hanging over your head, and when any course of positive act is only liken to hasten its execution. Saul, the eponomymous protagonist of Laszlo Nemeth's holocaust movie, responds by trying everything to bury a dead child who may not even be his actual son in accordance with the tradtion of his people, even if that means, as someone accuses him, ""betraying the living for the dead"". It's possible to think of Saul (brilliantly played by Geza Rohrig) as insane; but in a world where no-one has a real grasp on living, perhaps it's not so crazy to use your final moments to fashion a narrative that makes some kind of internal sense. Whereas many films about the holocaust (like 'Schindler's List', for example) tell the story obliquely, 'Son of Saul' is set fully in the horror of the death camps, which are portrayed as a hideous combination of '24' (i.e. with continual action and terror) and Hieronymous Bosch. Instinctively, one feels that (most days, at least) the life (and death) camps cannot have been so chaotically wild, if only to preserve the sanity of the guards; but instinctively also one cannot comprehend the murder of as many as six million. As with many films on this subject, what it really brings home is the fine dividing line between animal and the social construct of man."
" A very disturbing/depressing/distressful movie of a dark place in history.
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,6,"A strange film of an disturbing subject that we all think we know about, but does this film add to that story or does it just shock. The prisoner looking for his family documents through the discarded clothes of people that are about to be killed. He then see a boy who survives the gas and is then killed by a officer. He then decided to bury the boy before he is burned. The other prisoners want to destroy the camp, but he is more concerned with getting the boy buried and finding a Rabbi and looks to the new arrivals to answer his prayers. He then looses the explosives he had the job of getting. They latter escape and he tries to bury the boy but is disturbed and tries to carry the boy down river to escape. The other prisoners drag him to safety but the boy drifts away. The last scene is a young boy finding the prisoners hiding out, but guards closing in on them and then gun fire. In reality his boy was probably killed and they failed in their escape but the boys body, was never burned and was set free. Is the boys body floating away a sign of his soul being set free ?, or is it another failure of a prisoner mission to bury a boy the same age as his son."
" DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE.
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,8,"A different perspective on those involved in the holocaust. Personal, innovative, artistic and powerful experience with the holocaust as its setting."
" worst Holocaust movie ever
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,1,"The directing is so bad that after 20 minutes I still don't know what's going on. the director is a terrible story teller. I have to read the IMDb to know the story, which make no sense at all. the leading actor has an unlikable face. I don't have any compassion for him, just because his unlikable face and expression. I love movies like Schindler's List and The Pianist. But after watching this movie, I had a very bad impression of Jewish people. Seriously, they gave me an impression of rat. I know this is political incorrect, but this is the movie's real effect on me. The Jewish people in this movie are unlikable, especially the leading actor."
" Magnificent, beautiful
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,10,"Son of Saul is such a beautiful movie because of the authenticity of its images, that through its flashes of horror there is such a thing as historical accuracy, and in all this it is not the brightness of the colors which blow us away but the beauty of a smile with which the director leaves us behind. Never to forget, never to forget, never to forget."
" A study on human decency in a living hell
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,7,"A Hungarian war drama; A story about a Hungarian Sonderkommando during World War II who only has months to live because his class of worker knew too much about concentration camp crimes, and he must choose between a clandestine uprising and a personal matter dear to his heart. This is a grimly intense yet unforgettable film experience. The storytelling mastery approximates a haunting sensory journey. It is quite possibly the most harrowing film about the Holocaust because of the skilful camera techniques employed, putting the viewer in the horror at close range and having them observe the sickening conditions inmates had to endure."
" Wasted almost 2hours I won't ever get back
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,1,"I felt so angry after watching this like I just wasted almost 2hours of my life I wont ever get back. The movie follows a man who puts people in bad situations so he can find a rabbi to say a prayer for his dead son. As I continued watching you find put he actually doesnt have a son and he tries to bury the body of a kid and gets people killed while doing so. After the other prisoners escape the camp he takes the body with him and is too heavy to take across a creek so he is forced to let it go. Just while you saying to yourself hurry up, the germans are coming he mopes around while others are trying to help him get away. They come to another creek and sit there and here come the germans and shoot all of them and the movie ends. This movie left a bad taste in my mouth and I created an IMDb account just so I could review this. I cant believe people gave this a good rating. I have seen many ww2 movies and movies about concentration camps that are sad and end where everyone dies but there wasnt any meaning behind this whole movie. The grey zone was much better than this and basically ended the same way. Very disappointed."
" Crap movie...
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,2,"The director wanted to make something unique,but he made a crap movie."
" Annoying technique , unreasonable character but still make you feel auschwitz
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,6,"Its about a prisoner who works as Sonderkomando in concentration camp and tries to bury a boys body in a proper jewish way who survived the gas chamber.
The movie is filmed with a very strange , focusing on main character's head and back , by which the rest is more or less blur. Its not comfortable to watch this movie , and not entertaining at all too. Well noone can entertain in the atmospher of a concentration camp anyhow and in the movie makes you feel this atmosphere very good.
So in this aspect its very realistic but on the other hand the motivation of Saul for the dead boy can be considered as humanistic but for sure its not realistic but fantastic.."
" Irritating style
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,6,The shallow focus employed in the film works for 10 minutes then gets more and more irritating. The style gets in the way of the message
" A horrific subject is handled pretentious and boring
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,3,Seems like the bad camera work is made to make the intelligentia have to say they like it.
" Necessarily grim
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,7,"Son of Saul. Fictional drama set in unnamed concentration camp (although assumed to be Auschwitz as, according to historical text, most Hungarian Jews were sent there). Saul is a Hungarian 'Sonderkommando' - a fit and healthy Jewish prisoner forced to assist in the mass killing of his own people. Saul recognises one of the dead as his son (although we don't know if this is actually true or he imagines this in an attempt to keep his own sanity) and Saul's mission is to seek a Rabbi and give his 'son' a proper Jewish burial. It's a necessarily grim watch and brilliantly made but it's also a film that I probably went into with too high expectations, unlikely to be met. Will, however, give it another watch. 7 out of ten"
" Hell on earth
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,4,"I found this film almost as difficult to review as I did to watch. Surely no-one could imagine the horrors of trying to survive Auschwitz on a minute by minute never mind hourly or daily basis but this film puts you almost literally behind the eyes of one man in the camp as the camera only rarely changes perspective from his subjective viewpoint to a more objective position so that you effectively only see what he sees and experience what he experiences. Immediately you sense the dehumanization of the individual as he and his specially chosen fit and able fellow POW's perform the task of removing, burning and disposing of the remains of the hundreds of daily gas victims there. When he sees a young boy somehow survive the gassing only to be even more cruelly murdered by suffocation by the German doctor on the scene, he impulsively decides to appropriate the boy's corpse and have it consecrated by a rabbi.Along the way he gets involved in a mass escape attempt by his fellow inmates but even then carries the boy's body with him as he moves.As I said, the movie was excruciating to watch at times. Think of all the famous (or infamous) cultural or artistic depictions of hell by the likes of Dante, Hyronemus Bosch, Picasso, Goya and others and you're only part way there. The cacophonous background sounds, abrupt switching of perspectives and sometimes distorted speaking voices all combine to batter away at the viewer's senses so that on a sensory level, the movie succeeds if too well.As others have said however, when you learn that the story itself is fictionalised, when there were thousands of separate stories which could have been told, for me weakened the whole premise. I suppose we must be grateful that there is almost no real footage of the atrocities the Nazis committed in these labour camps and it's beyond argument, especially with the worrying rise these days of Holocaust deniers, that the producers and director of this searing movie, that it shouldn't be depicted as harshly and realistically as here.However, from a personal point of view, the combination of the relentless visual and audio attack on my senses together with that nagging doubt about the contrived nature of the main narrative in the end proved unsatisfactory to me. This subject is so vast and open to personal artistic interpretation that for some this hellish visualisation of events might be the best way to put across such an important message but as a movie viewer, I personally found it brutalising, numbing and much as I hate to say it repellent."
" A great contribution to the Holocaust genre
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,7,"Two days are chronicled in the life of Saul Auslander (Geza Rohrig), a Hungarian Jewish prisoner in Auschwitz in 1944.Saul is a Sonderkommando member of the concentration camp. His own life is temporarily spared and he gets better benefits than other prisoners but he and his fellow Sonderkommandos must do some of the worst work that the Nazis don't want to do. (I'm being deliberately vague to avoid spoilers.) Early in the film, Saul personally takes on a mission that involves a religious ritual and the search for a rabbi.The uniqueness of the directing style by Laszlo Nemes is highly praiseworthy. The camera is either on Saul in close-up or following behind him as the viewer sees what he sees while the background is out of focus. The atrocities seen in the background would have been the main dramatic focus of other films. Here, the viewer is taken to see that the horror is treated as a day-to-day work routine with much activity happening as the prisoners must be visibly busy to avoid the wrath of their slave-drivers. Thus, the casualness magnifies the horror.Rohrig also deserves praise for being in every scene and mostly in close-up at that. He does a fine job in conveying Saul's intensely desperate life while surrounded by insanity.There is much to admire about ""Son of Saul"" but it becomes difficult to understand why Saul is so relentless in his pursuit of his goal even though he jeopardizes himself and his fellow prisoners. Even if there was the slightest comment or hint to get closer to his motives, this could have made a good film into a great one. Some explanations include the possibility of insanity. While this may be true, the ambiguity becomes more frustrating than fascinating.It is easy to compare ""Son of Saul"" to other related Holocaust films that reach a higher mark:""Phoenix "", a German film also released in 2014;""Fateless"", another Hungarian Holocaust drama that was released in 2005;""Kapo"", an Italian film released in 1960. Like ""Son of Saul"", this film took on the difficult subject of concentration camp prisoners who turn against their own in order to alleviate their own personal circumstances. It dug deeply into the pain of conscience in such harrowing circumstances."
" Total pain - A quick review.
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,4,Movie is totally painful. First half you feel pain for the victims but after a certain point you start feeling pain for nonsenseness. I tried to feel emphaty with saul but by the movie comes to end it turned some bitter antipathy. If the point was to show his irrationality we can say that it was achived but anyhow it was hard to stand.
" Rubbish

" Skip this, watch 2001's The Grey Zone instead.
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,3,"Barely a plot, barely any dialogue, claustrophobia inducing hand held camera closeups through most of the film; clearly the director is doing this intentionally, but it just doesn't work. The moral plight of the Sonderkommandos (concentration camp inmates forced to do the Holocaust's dirtiest work) was covered much better in The Grey Zone. This film lacked for me the tension, and even the horror, by trying too hard to be intimate. I confess I didn't even make it to the end."
" A rare masterpiece
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,9,"I'll keep this short: Another rewiever wrote this film was about ""what a man will do when he goes insane"". That just hit me like a hammer, as it is exactly the other way around. This is not a film where a man goes insane. This is a film where one man is the only sane person in a world filled with insane and inhuman people. This is the purpose of the film. This is it's drive. All he tries to do in a world that has completely collapsed is to do one final act from the normal world that once were.This is so much better than all hero movies ever made. Saul is just a glimpse of normallity in a world that just gave up humanity in all senses."
" Horrifically Beautiful!

",2018-02-23 00:00:00,2,"I found this film offensive. In a concentration camp where people were being sent to the gas chambers a guy will focus his efforts in burying a corpse and risking his life and other people's lives to achieve his goal. Meanwhile other prisoners are busy with an escape plan and he spoils part of the plan because of his stupid obsession. In his situation his priorities should be: stay alive, escape and help to save other people's lives but his aim was to bury a cadaver only because of his stupid beliefs."
" If this is a film about humanity, humanity is in a really bad shape
",2018-02-15 00:00:00,6,"Okay pros first: technically this is an excellent film. Cinematography gives it a truly claustrophobic and confusing feel. You really feel like you're the main character in an utterly horrible place that you can't escape and don't really understand. It's something I haven't seen in a holocaust - not really in any - film before.Many people have said how the film is about the protagonist trying to find some piece of humanity in a horrific place. But the film is not about humanity, it's about insanity. The protagonist has gone insane - and I don't blame him considering that situation he's in. For me the problem is that you have to follow this insane unsympathetic character trying to complete his insane task for the whole 1h 40min. He is getting his comrades killed, he's risking their escape plan and generally acting like an asshole just to find a rabbi to bury a boy he thinks is his son.What really worries me is that Saul is caring more about one dead person than a bunch of living ones and people call that humane."
" Where we truly learn, what hell on earth truly is
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,9,"The Holocaust perpetrated by Nazi Germany in World War II is a touchy topic for any movie. Numerous documentaries have graphically shown the camps, the aftermath and the tools; writers and visual artists have expounded viscerally and poignantly for over half a century, and for lasting effect; and, of course, Hollywood and others have given us many biographical or fictional narratives to function as vehicles for holocaust commentary.None of the above, in my opinion, comes anywhere near the power of this movie, by first time writer/director, Nemes Laszo. Initially, the movie title intrigued me: Son of Saul. Which biblical Saul? I wondered. The first few minutes resolved that inquiry when it became evident that Saul Ausländer (Geza Röhrig) is one of the Hungarian-Jewish inmates of the camp assigned - as a member of the Sonderkommando i.e. Special Command - to persecute Jewish prisoners by assisting with herding them into gas chambers to their premature, unavoidable death. The irony of Saul's surname here - in English, Foreigner - serves to align this modern Saul with, naturally, Saul of Tarsus, Jewish and Roman citizen, and hence foreigner, who also persecuted the Jews - that is, until he experienced his life-changing epiphany on the road to Damascus.Röhrig the actor is phlegmatic to the point of being automaton, allowing virtually zero emotion on his face while he, as Saul, ritually and repetitively completes his horrific, daily routine of dispensing death to his fellow Jews. The hand-held camera is almost always on his face or the back of his head as we follow him everywhere in the camp, giving us a voyeuristic sense of heightened observation or even quasi-participation - a disturbingly unsettling feeling. Always in the background, and at the edges, the chaotic sights, unbearable sounds and unforgivable sins of the perpetrators while victims are summarily shot, shoved into gas chambers, thrown into fire, bludgeoned and beaten. These are Saul's days, staying alive for as long as he can, while consigning his humanity to the darkest depths of his persona....Until, unexpectedly, he discovers a young boy still alive - just - in the pile of bodies within a gas chamber: an apparent miracle. It's not clear if Saul knows him, or is even related to the boy. But, from that moment, Saul sets out to get the boy away to safety; and in apparent total disregard for his own life or, for that matter, the lives of his Sonderkommando accomplices in criminal anarchy. Thereafter, we continue to follow Saul as he continues his efforts to achieve his goal before he, also, is consigned to the same fate as all other victims.The denouement, when it comes, is realistic, inevitable and expected, I think - despite the dramatic twist the director inserts shortly before. The setting, acting, direction and camera work are simply outstanding. Never before, in all my time watching movies (sixty-five years and counting), have I been as close to a sense of reality as in this effort. There is harrowing, but also uplifting imagery in this story I will never forget.Highly recommended for mature adults and those interested in holocaust history. Nine out of ten."
" A haunting depiction of what we so easily transform into
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,10,"""Saul fia"" is a unique, extremely powerful and potentially traumatizing cinematic masterpiece. A debut of Hungarian director László Nemes and co-writer Clara Royer, the film is a horribly realistic vision of Auschwitz-Birkenau in 1944.The unfathomable horrors of the concentration camp are shown from a singular perspective: the Hungarian protagonist Saul is a member of the Sonderkommando, a group of typically Jewish prisoners who were afforded extra rations and liberties for assisting in the mass extermination of their fellows. They were executed after their service which averaged around three months.The film opens as a new shipment of prisoners arrives and is guided by Saul and his peers to the gas chambers. As members of the Sondercommando, their job is to get the prisoners into the chambers with no panic arising, collecting their goods for processing and cleaning up the chambers from signs of genocide by the next batch. They are in a hurry. The Allies are closing in, the amount of destruction is scaled up, just in case. The opening is sickening to watch and especially to listen to.As Saul cleans the floors of the gas chamber he discovers one young boy has survived the gassing. He is taken to an autopsy after getting suffocated by the doctors. Saul realizes that the boy must be his son, and decides to do anything in order to give him a proper Jewish burial instead of the ovens. We follow Saul on a desperate quest to retrieve the boy's body and escape just long enough for a burial. He also roams the camp for a rabbi to perform Kaddish for burial.Saul is played by New York -based poet Géza Röhrig. He hasn't acted in anything else for almost three decades and is completely brilliant in what must have been an incredibly painful role. He plays a hollow man, but his hollowness is a force of nature in and of itself. His dead eyes still haunt me.The entire film is shot with virtually one take. Cinematographer Matyas Erdely's camera follows Saul intensely as he walks through the unfathomable inferno of Auschwitz for two days. Shallow focus shows Saul clearly while his surroundings remain blurry. The aspect ratio creates a claustrophobic box around him. We see all the horror but can't make it out in detail. We hear everything.I'm not entirely sure about the suggestive approach; it's certainly better than showing everything in focus but in a reduced manner. A clear, realistic depiction of all that we know went on might simply be too much for any audience to bear. Also, one of the most chilling points achieved by the shallow focus is in conveying the complete sense of detachment Saul feels about the things he sees and must participate in. He exists beyond morality, even beyond survival until he reconstitutes through his son. But for his quest, he's already dead. This also shows us viewers how easily we all get detached. People become bodies become waste out of focus. Just like when psychological dehumanization takes effect.At times the movie feels even tedious while it conveys absolutely incomprehensible cruelty in action. That tedium is intentional. Two hours is enough for one to turn apathetic in the face of genocide. A lesson frighteningly current. And not only in the film's homeland where antisemitism and general xenophobia seem to have emerged as the new normal but also all around Europe as well as the rest of the world. We are weak, fearful and passive, and because of that we can turn into vessels for acts of absolute evil.""Saul fia"" is one of those movies that I find powerful- even masterful- in the extreme but so traumatizing on so many levels that I can't directly recommend it to anyone. It exposes humanity at its weakest, darkest and most dangerously passive, just as it exposes every viewer."
" A deeply moving, cinematically audacious experience
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,8,"Son of Saul blew me away in so many respects. This is quite an unusual film in so many ways, from the direction to the unique and successful way it delivers emotions. It tells a simple story, but anyone will realize how powerful it is by simply reading the synopsis.The one thing that first struck me about this film is Géza Röhrig 's performance as Saul. Given that this story unfolds in Auschwitz and all the horrors that are being depicted, emotions are delivered in quite a subtle manner, on one hand picturing the main character as a man carrying heavy emotional baggage, and on the other showing some surprising inner strength, fostered by his newfound quest of morally surviving by burying the body of a dead boy.László Nemes' direction is quite unique, as it consists of pretty close shots of the protagonist with everything surrounding him out of focus, leaving some of the horrors to the imagination at times, and creating a tense, hellish atmosphere in other scenes - always maintaining this emotional intimacy between the audience and Saul. Had Röhrig not been as stellar as he was, this could have been quite heavy - and borderline unwatchable. Honestly, this was quite a gamble - but the audacity paid off.You will not hear any music throughout the entire film. Again, I felt like it added to the subtlety in the delivery of emotions, as it never dictates how the viewer should feel - leaving Saul as the only true vehicle of emotion. Instead, with everything but the protagonist out of focus, the sound (which is very well executed) complements the blurry background and brings it to life in all its chaos, tension and horror. You don't always clearly see what is happening around Saul, but you certainly hear and feel it with him.The ending alone makes it worth watching the entire film. It is brilliant and it brought me to tears. Without giving anything away, let's just say that, throughout the film, the protagonist never gets the emotional relief of simply shedding tears. Again, emotions are delivered so subtly. But he does get one reaction that really stands out at one point, and it is one of the most truly moving, beautiful moments I've seen in a film. As I am writing these lines, I can still picture this cinematic moment and feel its power. Solid and haunting - in a beautiful way - ending.Very highly recommended."
" Disappointing and Annoying
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,6,"I won't spend too much time on this review other than to say that, with an IMDb rating of 7.5, I expected a much better movie.I quite understand why the director invested so much time and effort in trying to engage the viewer in the main character's view of the atrocity that must have been life in one of the Germans' extermination camps during WWII. The message was conveyed loud and clear that survival for Saul and those like him was a minute by minute matter. Alive this minute and with a bullet in the brain the next if he even looked at one of the SS Officers or guards.Having said that I understand the reasons for trying to engage the audience by use of very unusual cinematography, I must say that I found the idea of looking at the back of Saul's head for almost the entire length of the movie, with everything else around him being thrown out of focus was, after about ten minutes, not only distracting but also extremely annoying. Of course there's a morbid fascination even these days at what the Nazis did during WWII, and it is true that we've seen similar movies made many times over the years. But rarely has a movie on this subject been so annoying and ultimately unsatisfying.I wanted to like this movie ""Son Of Saul"" but I just couldn't forgive it the infuriating lack of focus on the events that were going on around Saul, rather than on the back of his head and its small and insignificant place in the camp.JMV"
" A nonsense pretentious film, total waste of time.
",2017-11-17 00:00:00,2,"This is the first time i write a review, but because this movie is so bad, i really believe in the Oscar hype, but oh my...The Plot is total nonsense, no character develop, no proper dialogue, total frenzy shots, i know is a death camp and the camera moves with the flow of the situation, but, the main character is so cold, like an iceberg, i mean they're already death from been there but he just can't let go the corpse of a child, he clings so much for it that it start to be really annoying. I don't recommend anybody to see this movie, is just a pretentious film, time that will not go back in your life, if you wanna see a really good film about concentration camps, go see The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, but not this, i really mean it."
" An extraordinary film
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,10,"It made me think of ""Schindler's List""(1993) but this ""Son of Saul""(2015) is different. It's as good as Spielberg's film, maybe even better. Love for your own child, even dead, makes you do unusual things, to defy death that awaits for you anyway, inside or off the concentration camp. A film excellently played, filmed, directed."
" worst Jew movie ever
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,5,i usually like Jew movies and i find them touching the holocaust stories out there are great and there is so much emotions in them but this one no sir i don't think so the first half hour is boring that you would probably leave the cinema and choose not to suffer through the rest of the movie but i somehow managed to keep watching and either its a bad ending or good ending it doesn't matter the movie sucks and it does not deserve an Oscar for sure so it is also the worst Oscar winning or nominated movie of the year 2016 and i have seen most of them.
" Made me feel weak and lost for hope .
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,6,"Never reviewed a film before , don't care about my spelling don't care about the ,s and the .s , just watched the film and felt the need to write something . Rated the film 6 , wanted to give it 7 or 8 for the first 30 minutes of the film , but slowly started to get annoyed. Hate the Jewish propaganda of religious importance . F.ck the religion , not only Jewish but Christian , Muslim and all the rest. Hated the importance of a religious tradition to bury a body of a boy , over the importance to save lives. Don't make a film about the few that chose to obey , the few that chose their life over hundreds of others !!!!!!!!!!! .F.ck this film and its maker . Make a film about the people that were brave enough to give their lives to safe others , others lives not just bodies because of their religious believes !!! . Started writing this with a rate of 6 for this film , finished with a rate of 4 . I understand that this is factual , and probably needs to be said and past on . First review that i find when i google this film is ' an outstanding, excoriating look at evil in Auschwitz ... This astonishing debut film, about a prisoner in the concentration camp employed in the industrial processes of body disposal, is a horror movie of extraordinary focus and courage' , my opinion , detailed look at the ill and bent by religion mind that's at the end of it sanity . Chooses the burial of a body over the lives of fellow living people. Courage ???!?!?!? Wheres the f.c king courage ? , insanity all the way !!! . During WW2 courage meant death !! and the word courage should be reserved for the people that lost their lives saving others or trying to end the tragedy of ww2 and the German invasion. The so called courage of Saul caused more death . People around tried to survive , realising that there is no mother f ucking GOD !!!! and even if there is one , hes a f cking pr.ck , allowing this to happen . He was so courageous , that he didn't risk his life for his sons life but he risked his life and lives of others for his sons body . Film about surrender , the less we get of this sort the better we will be . Thank You"
" a harrowing exploitation of the Holocaust, to the taste of Academy members
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,7,"The debut feature film from Hungarian filmmaker László Nemes, SON OF SAUL wins Oscar's BEST FOREIGN LANGUAGE PICTURE in 2016, it is a hard-nosed Holocaust drama takes a unique focal point of one particular Sonderkommando (Nazi's death camp inmates who are chosen to dispense with gas chamber victims), the Jewish-Hungarian Saul Ausländer (Röhrig, sometimes feels stilted but overall quite an endeavor from a non-professional).From the word go, Nemes' discreet modality of entirely putting Saul at the center stage grandly comes home to the audience, starting from an out of focus shot slowly clings to its object Saul, our visual cynosure, then meticulously follows his steps (a back-of-his-head vantage point) and only shows us what is happening strictly from his prospect, it is an intriguing and contained ploy, on one hand, the film waives a holistic view of the happenings, for fear that the uncompromising atrocity it scrupulously re-enacts is too much for viewers to bear, thus mercifully we are only presented with glimpses through Saul's constant movement, who seems to be strung-out yet benumbed, most of the time, he keeps to himself; on the other hand, the skimpy scenes are no less soul-stirring, the gas chamber, piles of naked cadavers, incinerators, dumping truckloads of ashes, the rampant slaughter, the whole package is there (a sterling job for its production designer, the Hungarian architect László Rajk Jr.), selectively materializes predicated upon Saul's presence, one indubitable merit of Nemes' picture is it has miraculously re-created a reliving the horror experience that possibly errs on the side of being so vicarious that one is instinctively repelled and tries to turn away from it. That is an inextricable dilemma of any film, cinema aims to engross, however, when the subject it depicts is inherently repugnant and horrendous to a fault, as a result we are often mired between these two disparate states, a self-inflicted masochism. Is there any redeeming grace to temper the milieu's inhuman brutality and its overlaying smothering? Yes, there must be, it is Saul's spur-of-the-moment decision to carry out a proper Jewish burial for a boy who dies after barely surviving the gas chamber and whom he claims to fellow inmates is his son (is it true? the answer is deliberately moot, but one inclines to nay, which makes Saul's action more perverse and improbable, maybe he thinks the boy's ephemeral survival is a numinous call for his action), so the imperative mission for him is to find a rabbi to officiate the burial, meantime, chivvied by Abraham (Molnár), another Sonderkommand, he is also embroiled into an impending uprising as their last attempt to scupper their imminent doomsday, but Saul is halfhearted. Granted that Saul's intransigency gravely compromises his contribution to the nobler/righteous cause (to an extent that he will lose those precious smuggled gun powders, and volunteer his own demise just to find a rabbi during the infernal pandemonium), the film perilously threats to negate its own raison d'être, which is to retain an infinitesimal trace of faith and courage to survive under such egregious monstrosities in the manifestation of defiance, Jews are being decimated, but their culture and rituals are deathless. In the end of the day, Saul's effort is futile, the rabbi he rescues is a sham, the body fails to be pushing up the daisies and when the camera finally veers from Saul after his hard-earned smile, what manifests is not a glint of hope but a consolation or a surrender only too soon will be rendered insignificant, ambiguity again takes an upper hand in this harrowing exploitation of the Holocaust, for all its calculated aesthetics, its impact is confounding and its laurels are undue."
" No Saul I mean Sell for me here!
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,5,"The Oscar-winning Hungarian Holocaust movie ""Son of Saul"" has received a bountiful of critical and award love. I don't wanna sound like a sour grape, but this sour movie did not move me at all; you want more Saul on your entertainment taste, ""Better Call Saul"" instead. In all seriousness, ""Son of Saul"" stars Geza Rohrig as Saul, a 1944 Auschwitz Jewish prisoner who is forced to burn corpses of his own people. Saul is presented with a dilemma when he sees his son is in the group next in line to be incinerated. Saul then goes on a conquest for his son not to be one of them. He takes heavy risks, connives his allies, all the works really for his son not to be put in flames. Director Lazlo Nemes shoots the picture in close proximity with the lead character, which I found it to be very irritating instead of capturing. I was trying to be Finding Nemes in Nemes' chronological work, but it seems this was his first real picture; and it showed. I am sorry to say nothing struck me profoundly in ""Son of Saul""; not the directing, the writing, nor the acting. And yes, I do think it's extremely overrated. But maybe, me who is the Son of Jose (dad's name) just did not see ""Son of Saul"" the way others did. ** Needs Improvement"
" Do not fall for the 7.5 IMDb rating
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,5,"As the title says, do not fall for the apparently high rating of this movie.I'm sorry to say it but this movie is boring from the beginning to the end, and I'm not talking about art or cinema techniques or whatever, I am just giving my opinion on what the movie meant for me.The story makes no sense at all since the task Saul is performing doesn't correspond to the human nature. Who in a similar situation would prevail the correct disposal of a dead body over his/her own survival? Nobody, that is simple.Another kind of ""annoying"" detail is the visual perspective of the movie, it is uncomfortable to follow the story in that way because almost everything (except the main character) is out of focus.I wouldn't recommend to watch it."
" What We Talk About When We Talk About
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,7,"I found the filmmaking style a bit grating at times. I love the conversation it starts, about the acceptable ways in which to experience the Shoah through art, but it also does feel like it's done as a way of exploiting the horrors therein. Does this filmmaking style work if it isn't based on the Shoah? I don't know that that's easily answered.It's also clear that the plot is a thin veil through which to take a tour of the horrors of the camp without directly dealing with them. It's ostensibly a fetch quest about an oft overlooked person (in historical accounts that is) in the camps -- the sonderkommando -- trying to bury someone who is or isn't his son. A reckoning with grief, and exploitation."
" Son of Saul
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"I set myself a target every year to watch every single film that wins and gets nominated at the Oscars, I had watched the other four nominees in the Foreign Language category, I saved this Hungarian film, the winner, until last. Basically set during the Second World War, Hungarian-Jewish Saul Ausländer (Géza Röhrig) is a prisoner in the Nazi extermination camp at Auschwitz, he a member of Sonderkommando, forced under pain of death to aid with the disposal of gas chamber victims. Saul and the other members know that the prisoners they are enclosing in showers are going to their deaths, the members' work consists of disinfecting the gas chamber after use, going through victims' personal possessions to find valuable items, and disposing of the ashes after the bodies have been burned. One of these gassings however sees Saul pulling out the body of a boy he is convinced is his son, the Germans want to perform an autopsy on the body, but Saul manages to steal the body and avoid this happening. Saul wants to give his son's corpse a proper Jewish burial, he is looking for a Jewish rabbi to preside over the burial, he tells other worker prisoners what he is doing in the hope that they will assist him. Saul finds out that many of the worker prisoners are trying to smuggle out information about the atrocities of the camp to show the world, in order to begin an uprising against their captors. The other Sonderkommando members see their task as more important, and there are many moments when Saul may get stalled or caught, including in the indoor and outdoor crowds of other prisoners, but then there comes a point when the usefulness of the working prisoners for the captors may be coming to an end. A riot breaks out, S-S guards are attacked and the rebellion starts, Saul and a group of prisoners are able to escape, he carries the body of his boy, but he is forced to let it go in the current of the river. In the end Saul and the prisoners find a shed in the forest, they rest to discuss a plan to join the Polish resistance, Saul notices a young peasant boy outside, they smile at each other, the boy runs away and guards pass him, in the direction of the shed, gunfire echoes through the woods and the boy walks away. Also starring Levente Molnár as Abraham Warszawski, Urs Rechn as Oberkapo Biederman, Jerzy Walczak as Rabbi Frankel, Sándor Zsótér as Dr. Miklos Nyiszli, Marcin Czarnik as Feigenbaum, and twins Gergö and Balázs Farkas as Saul's Son. It has been seventy years since the events of the Holocaust, Life Is Beautiful and The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas are examples of films that have successful made a fictional but realistic story using a concentration camp, this film proves that there is still room for a new film about this subject. It is simply watching the life of a working prisoner of Auschwitz over a two day period, but what makes this film really clever is that we only see what the character sees, the shocking exterminations and hundreds of people confined and suffering seen from the point of view of the lead character is much more powerful, it is intense and harrowing, but a respectful and magnificent wartime drama. It won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Film not in the English Language, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Foreign Language. Very good!"
" a Sonderkommando looks to right a wrong
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,10,"I had heard loosely of Sonderkommandos before watching László Nemes's ""Saul fia"" (""Son of Saul"" in English), but the movie takes an unusual approach to it. This is one of the only movies that I've seen in which almost all the focus is literally on one person, with the background blurred. This serves to emphasize the desperation of the protagonist, a Sonderkommando in 1944 Auschwitz, who wishes to give his son a proper burial. Indeed, we see murdered bodies, as well as the atrocities getting committed by the Nazis, but Saul himself is essentially the window into this horrible setting.It's an outstanding movie in every way. While much of the movie may seem slow, it's like this so that the characters can develop. It grows especially intense during the final fifteen to twenty minutes. But the truth is that the whole movie is excellent. It deserved the awards that it won.Another Hungarian movie dealing with the experience of the Jews during this period is 1983's ""Jób lázadása"" (""The Revolt of Job"" in English), about a Hungarian boy adopted by a Jewish couple."
" Son of Saul - a religious symbol of everlasting life
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"The movie Son of Saul is a religious movie about a little, 11 year old boy who actually survives the blast of gas inside the gas chambers in the Second World War. He is lifted out of the corpses of naked bodies and is put on a table. A man listens and hears his breathe - in and out - inhale and exhale. This is like the breathe that God breathes into Adam in order to create man. This breathe is very significant and represents all of human life. Saul understands this meaning and wants a religious leader to mark this miracle - of surviving the holocaust ovens and breathing outside the gates of hell. Saul searches for a rabbi. It is unclear in the movie if a rabbi is found, as I do not have enough knowledge of what being a rabbi entails. Saul did find someone who I think could have been a rabbi - but the burial for the small boy who survived the gas chambers was never completed to the end. There was an attempt made but then they had to flee again. I believe that the boy transformed into a German Spy when he was left to drown - half alive in the river. The river must have awoken the boy and he went to where Saul was hiding to witness him one more time. Saul was then delusional and thought the young boy was wearing Nazi clothes and a informer - but this was the holy child not an informant. Saul was hallucinating. In the end Saul gets shot to death - but not without giving up, withdrawing and being internally defeated first."
