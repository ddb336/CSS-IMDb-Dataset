" Emotional and brilliant
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,10,Thoroughly enjoyed this film. I thought the cast were brilliant as was the story. Very emotional.
" And the best thing in this movie is....
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,7,"STEVE CARELL!!
The rest of it is a sweet love story. Politically, marriage and domestic partnership only has a fiscal meaning to the government. This movie focused only on the emotional aspects, and didn't put forth any legal arguments. Of course marriage and love are deep subjects, but they don't belong to the government. That's why we have coworkers (like the police officers in this movie) and family to help and support us."
" Freeheld Is A Winner
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,9,"I remember this case which sought to deny pension benefits to the survivor of a terminally ill gay police officer in Ocean County NJ. At the time, it seemed very unfair to many people on both sides of the political aisle . The lesbian couple was beautifully played by the amazing Julianne Moore and Ellen Page. Michael Shannon and Steve Carrell also deserve kudos for their performances."
" Intriguing, but detached
",2018-04-20 00:00:00,7,"What Freeheld gets right, it got well fitting cast in a roles they handle the most best. Julianne Moore plays a lead as an police officer phasing a devasteting desease. Ellen Page portrates perfectly her younger partner. Both captivate their characters essence and battles well.Downside is that their dialogue feels forced most of the time. Freeheld captivates the legal battle greatly and gives it time and emotion. But the majority of film it seems that there's no love story what that battle was initially supposed to be built on. Where's the connection that drives eithee of leads?There of, even though coverage on the story was kept together, I cannot possibly rate Freeheld more than 7 out of 10."
" Equality Before The Law.
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,6,"It's better than it has a right to be.Two women -- Moore and Page -- fall in love and move into a house in Ocean County in southern New Jersey. Moore is a detective on the police force and Page works as a mechanic. Well, southern New Jersey is not the New York metropolitan area nor a raffish suburb of Philadelphia. It's not exactly hick country either, not since the highways made it possible to commute to the cities, but it still retains some of its quaint charm. Ocean County includes the pine barrens, a sandy country of stunted pines, prickly pear cactus, and copper colored shallow creeks, a broad portion of leftover coastal plain. It's the only state home of the New Jersey pine snake (Putuophis m.melanoleucus), a tough specimen of which I was happy and proud to catch and release.Where was I? I do wish you'd stop interrupting my train of thought. Pretty soon I'll offer to show you where I store my specimens. Yes, so anyway Moore and Page have a happy household and eventually Moore's partner on the police force, Michael Shannon, comes around to accepting this unusual m√©nage. But then it is discovered that Moore has incurable lung cancer. Despite treatment she gets sicker and sicker and decides to leave her police pension to Page. Uh-oh. The couple aren't man and wife, just ""domestic partners."" Moore's employers at the police department are uncertain about the deal so the matter is referred to the Ocean County Board of Selectmen or Aldermen or Freeholders or whatever they are. They demur.The rest of the movie is taken up with Moore's search for what she calls equality, not special privilege, but the case is sensationalized by the media and all kinds of people with all kinds of motives show up at the Board meetings. Among the most impressive of these visitors is Steve Carrell as a hyperenergetic New York gay Jew who prances around leading chants and calling everyone ""Sweetheart."" Nothing in the movie comes as much of a surprise. There is anger and confusion. A few locals support the cause, the Selectmen are afraid it will cost them votes to hand the pension over to Page, Shannon is stalwart in his support, and sooner or later the anticipated happens. The direction by Peter Sollett is unobtrusive. Moore gives an excellent performance as usual. She sickens credibly. I groan with delight whenever Ellen Page speaks. There is no other such offhand voice, no matter what the subject. But, alas, she's not given much chance to exercise her acting chops. For most of the movie she trudges around wearing a face like the mask of tragedy, as if she'd just been told they stopped serving breakfast at eleven. It never changes. If this were fiction and her name could be made up, it would be Delores not Stacie. Michael Shannon is surprisingly effective. He's beetle-browed and hardly handsome but he brings an everyman quality to his roles precisely because he doesn't seem to be an actor. His underplaying added considerable power to his role as a schizophrenic in ""Take Shelter.""I said initially that it was better than it had a right to be. What I meant was that it wasn't sicklied over with the ghoulish cast of excessive piteousness. Think what could have been done with this adult flick if it had appeared as a drama on Lifetime Movie Network."
" Fight for Equality
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,7,The movie was inspired by the Oscar winning documentary and several of the real life folks have cameos in the film. Julianne Moore and Ellen Page play a couple that falls in love and then deals with a cancer diagnosis and then a fight for a police pension after twenty three years of service to be granted to her domestic partner. Well done as some of the characters you truly begin to despise over the course of the film. It's always good to be on the right side of history.
" compelling history told flatly
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,6,"Laurel Hester (Julianne Moore) is a police investigator in Ocean County, New Jersey. She is a closeted gay to everyone at work including her longtime partner Dane Wells (Michael Shannon). She starts dating young mechanic Stacie Andree (Ellen Page). They sign up as domestic partners. When Laurel is diagnosed with cancer, she applies to have Stacie receive her pension only to be rejected by the town council for their lack of a marriage. Gay activist Steven Goldstein (Steve Carell) sees a golden opportunity to fight for gay marriage.This should be a compelling movie especially with these great actors. Everything seems to be there except for some imagination in its execution. The writing is formulaic. The movie could be interesting if it picks one character to tell the story. It essentially follows Moore in the first half but her character is incapacitated in the last part of the movie. The movie needs some imagination in its construction to make this film more original. On a minor note, the Jersey accent makes the romancing a little awkward. The ladies are good together. Dane has the most interesting journey. This could have been one of the year's best but it's not even close."
