" No words to say best psychological thriller movie
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,10,Anurag kashyap is a great film maker and cast acting is really awesome and terrific background score of ram sampath and other technician also worked really awesome I'm seen movie is 8th std annual leave time but still i give the review.must watch don't miss it! It's really underrated movie.....üëçüèª‚ù§üëçüèª
" Nawazuddin Siddiqui is
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,8,Role of everything like at hollywood positon christian bale.what plots ever he acts.to the backbone.this man unique actors and honour raised by bollywood new genre.
" Just don't watch this movie
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,1,Waste of time. There are lots of loop holes in this movie. Even a kid can catch the police officer as there are lots of evidence available bt its just creating unnecessary drama and showing police department as fool.
" Badly Brilliant.
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,7,"I gave 7 stars to this movie because it deserves them. The film is made brilliantly with great acting and cinematography. The theme is dark and gory. The characters are also portrayed amazingly but there is something missing and you wait for it till the end but won't be satisfied. See, the point is that no matter how great is the acting, filming, camera work, graphics but if the story is weak than there is no point to the film and that is exactly what happens with this one. So if you are in a mood to watch some classic AK movie than definitely go for it, but if you want to watch something which has a some meaning than probably skip it this time."
" Hidden Gem of Bollywood
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,8,"There are no Bollywood movies which highlights (serial killer genre). Raman Raghav 2.0 is Creepy. Outstanding Acting done by Nawazuddin Siddiqui. It feels like documentry of Siddiqui .the Cop vikky also did great Acting.
Climax of the movie was like expecting the unexpected.
Ending of the movie was good."
" A very dark physiological thriller...
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,9,Raman Raghav 2.0 directed by Ak is very dark physiological thriller it's a watchable one....
" Very well done
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,9,"The acting, sound, story all is done brilliantly - loses 1 star cuz it could have been shorter"
" The best indian cinema.
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,10,This movie has become one of the best movies of my life.
" Poor
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,4,"Blend of Insomnia, The Sinner and some other I haven't watched and executd very poorly. Storyline is tiresomely boring and lacks coherence. Also why tf no one shouts or reacts when they see a dead body or are about to get killed? Totally wasted the time"
" The movie may be good but it's just over the top disturbing
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,6,"I think the disturbing part could have been milder, the constant woman abuse was hard to watch for me. Vicky Kaushal played a male chauvinistic pig. Couldn't really like the story when there's all that ott dialogue and scenes in the movie. They should really tone down on this type of violence it doesn't matter what they're trying to show the audience."
" Don't have enough words to dissect Nawaz's Stellar Presence in Here!
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,7,"If I were to sum it up; ""Raman Raghav 2.0"" is nothing but a barefaced character study. Incorporating a Sociopath, a frenzied cop; and their eventual affiliation shaped under distressing circumstances.Depiction of a devilish killer, an insightful look within his crippled mind is in itself a petrifying thing to tell. With the help of Mr. Kashyap's pronounced finesse and an unerring act by Nawazuddin Siddiqui; Comes out an astute impersonation of a demented murderer.Vicky Kaushal as the disorganised & drug addict policeman was simply amazing. The limelight might have been on Nawaz; yet Vicky succeeded finding out his own rhythm. This marked as Sobhita Dhulipala's debut feature, and I can definitely apprehend the success she got afterwards in several roles. A hefty praise goes to Anurag for continuously being the torch bearer in introducing promising talents.Performances are the heart and soul in here alongside a technical prowess commonly showcased in a Kashyap Production! This time, the other aspects failed to accommodate.
The storyline seems inchoate, inconsistencies in the writing being the main culprit.
There are definite loose ends in the screenplay therefore weakening the core contemplation.
Jumping around discrete timelines with advancing chapter sequences; a hard act to follow.He can certainly do better, as his other stirring works are substantial testimonies to that!"
" A memorable movie
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,9,"Raman Raghav 2.0 is a 2016 Bollywood movie directed by Anurag Kashyap and starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui. It is loosely based on the serial killer Raman Raghav who was active in Mumbai in 1960s.The movie is a gripping thriller and will not leave you bored in any of its parts. A brilliant take on the life of a serial killer and how he is almost caught by the cops and always manages to escape. The killings, the emotions involved and the nuances...all have been beautifully depicted in the movie. It's indeed a underrated gem of a movie.The stellar performance put on by Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Vicky Kaushal will get one so invested in the movie that for once one will forget that it's a movie. Sobhita Dhulipala also doesn't fail to impress. Perfect casting.Finally, this movie is a must watch if you like edge-of-the-seat thrillers. You won't be disappointed."
" Thrilling
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,8,"A very dark psychological treat. I think, this is Nawazuddin's best performance till date. Very capturing right from the start with an amazing score that creates a uneasy and fearful environment. Most of the violence happening in the movie is off screen but it is as scary as it gets."
" Evils we see & Evils we don't...
",2020-09-11 00:00:00,9,"A Psychopath Serial Killer becomes obsessed with a corrupt cop who is trying to arrest him. Nawazuddin Siddiqui gives another great performance as the bone-chilling, unpredictable, merciless but surprisingly honest killer for whom murdering is a need. But this film in a deeper level is a study of evil, how mens' desire to do evil deeds is given a justification in the name of justice, nationalism, religion. The writing & direction of Anurag Kashyap is top-notch & great use of techno music."
" Frustrating
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,4,Why is the Indian police so incompetent and people's reaction in danger just incomprehensible.Wanted to like but...
" Don't watch with Children
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,5,Very terrific.. My mood gone off after watching this movie..
" A Meaningless Psychological Thriller
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,2,"Brutal Scenes, Unconventional Story & Conclusion less movie.
Waste of time."
" Movies review
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,1,Tym waste movie movie meant for fun and some great message this movie except nawzudins acting bakwass movie
" Below the standard...!!
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,2,"However serial killer movies are storyes of mentally unstable people, but this time I think film makers aslo suffering from same problem.
Low - level sexuality and violence have been shown."
" A dark psychological thriller which could make you view the people surrounding you differently.
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,7,"A brilliant piece of work from the director of Gangs of Wasseypur, Dev D, Black Friday, etc, Anurag Kashyap and from his production house Phantom Films. The story revolves around the serial killer Ramanna and the cop investigating his his case,Raghavan.
it is basically a love story involving two serial killers one killing people as an habit an; another out of necessity. The film starts with the first act opening with Raghavan snorting cocaine in a bathroom of a night club. Then he dances like a madman mets Simmy and returns home with her . On the way home Raghavan stopped in front of his drug dealers house where Ramanna was killing the dealer.
not being answered by the dealer Raghavan went to investigate and he was spotted by the dealers neighbour whom Raghavan killed. Ramanna saw the whole incident and he found his other half.
Then the story follows with Ramanna stalking Raghavan and killing a bunch of people on the way.He even surrendered himself once and told the police his story by the the police thought him to be a homeless surrendering himself hoping for a better life in jail.The police took him seriously after he killed his sister and her whole family, After that the police chased him and he eventually surrendered making raghavan realise that he is his soulmate.
The character of Ramanna was played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui, who was brilliant in the role and way he claimed himself as the CCTV camera of God, and way he stalked Raghavan was extremely creepy . Vicky Kaushal was excellent as the mentally unstable drug addict cop .The character Simmy was played Debutant Sobhita Dhulipala who was also very good. The story itself is not very strong but the brilliant performance by the actors is what brings life to the film."
" Enjoyed it in parts
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,7,"It's not a psychological thriller like others. It's not a serial killer hunt. It's something else. First there is Raman, a serial killer and then there is a cop inspecting his case. The segments of Raman are relatively better, much better. The parts of Raghav are uninteresting, but get better at the end. But somewhere, they don't connect to each other well. The film lacks the appeal.Taking nothing away Amruta Subhash, Vipin Sharma and Vicky Kaushal, this film belongs to Nawazuddin Siddiquie. He dominates everyone where he is present. Unlike other Pyscho killers, he does not have that trademark smile, he does not look intimidating from his face and act more like a normal person. But, he is still threatening enough and creepy as well. He goes deep into the pysche of character avoiding all conventional means of acting.Some reviewers are saying this is boring, I disagree. It's not. Raghav's character though, is not very detailed. I wish the film was all about Raman only, it would be more interesting."
" The greatest Hindi movie of modern times
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,10,"This movie is not for the weak hearted. Not a family movie. The serial killer (Nawasuddin) played the role of his life. I have watched a 100 serial killer movies, this one is one up there...one of the MOST gripping dark, chilling, evil movies I have seen. It is as realistic as it gets. When you see him eat a leftover burger that he picked from garbage and when he cries and says he is hungry, you feel pity and then you hate him when he is prowling for his next victim.The disturbed and violent cop that is on his trail was played perfect too. I give this a 10/10 because I thought camera work, direction, music, actors ..even the smallest bit was done 100% real. and even though you hate him for what he does you are going to be startled by his honest conversations. I know if you had enjoyed wasting money on chunkey pandeys and sunil shettys you woould not appreciate this movie because your protogonist Raman Raghav 2.0 is sleeping and living and eating in Bombay;s garbage and filthy areas. Greatest Hindi movie of all times!!"
" Bizzare
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,8,"Raman Raghav 2.0 is one of the darkest and bizarre movie I've seen from Bollywood and none other then Kashyap could've done this job with so much conviction. The film marks the acting debut of Vicky Kaushal and he portrays the character of a corrupt alcoholic police officer effortlessly but sadly overshadowed because he was sharing the screen with Nawazuddin Siddiqui played the role of Ramanna a disturbed and bizarre serial killer. Nawazuddin nailed the character brilliantly, his screen presence will give you chill and haunt you for sure. The scene when Raman visits her sister's house was so bizarre that it will definitely haunt you for a long long time and that is why I would recommend it only to the people who likes to watch dark movies as this movie would be too much to handle for regular movie watcher."
" Mai kisi ki aad me nahi chipta, mai wardi ke peeche nahi chipta
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,9,"Unconventional, ultra-realistic, heart wrenching, a mirror.These two characters were so superbly written and performed, I got binged in the first scene itself.It's a connection between the open and closed pretenses. It's the ultimate truth of a human brain, the ultimate answer which is always there but is mostly ignored. A death is a death and there are no criminals as such.All the criminals just do what anyone else would do in normal situations, he is obviously not the most rational being around but no one really is if there are no consequences. People hurt themselves through pretenses, they enjoy suffering and will do whatever they require to in order to achieve what they desire.Raman and Raghav are mere shadows of these desires and that's the beauty of this movie. I enjoy watching cinema which is realistic, and not absolute manifestation of some utopia. I firmly think that more human emotions can be taught from such films than other mediums. People are after-all slaved of their nature and do everything they do just in order to survive in this self-made society."
" Trying too hard but not meeting expectations.
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,5,"Acting was good but movie does not have a gripping storyline.
I didn't have much expectation about the story but I hoped that atleast the movie will revolve around the logic of how the serial killer (raman) sees this world. This would have been a great experience to watch a movie which shows the world of a serial killer but it is not satisfying at all. The only thing that keeps us going is the superb acting of both Nawaz and Vicky.
I have noticed that Anurag tried to make this movie like Quentin tarantino directs his movies. This maybe a good thing for him but Quentin's movie even if starts with a slow pace surely delivers at the end. The same cannot be said about this movie. You will see Raman saying some random things about religion, society and othere stuff. I don't see why it was necessary.
Bottom line is there is no story and no unique experience."
" A good thriller until unless you feel it just stole the idea from insomnia
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,7,"I saw this film a couple of days back and really felt it was a nice movie and one of the best the bollywood have had produced but then today I watched insomnia,directed by most anticipated director Chrostopher Nolan.Insomnia was a 2002 movie and raman raghav 2.0 was released in 2016.Insomnia is a great work of Nolan and was unique in it's idea but kashyap just stole his idea.If you don't believe me then just watch insomnia and you will come to know the truth.They didn't mentioned it anywhere that it was a adaption or something.Really disappointed me today."
" Nawazuddin Siddiqui Show why He's a good actor...
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,8,"What A Brilliant Movie....Raman Raghav 2.0 Is A pyschological Thriller Movie which was really nice. Starring Vicky Kaushal and Nawazuddin Siddiqui who plays psycho killer roles. Movie's Chapter wise Storytelling methods was really impressive. Storyline Was incredible, Screenplay was Awesome and Direction was Unbelievable.
That is a first Movie i watched There is no Hero on movie. This movie based on a Psycho villans.Vicky was awesome but Nawazuddin Siddiqui was Amazing he played her role Incredible when i see Nawazuddin in this movie I'm Shocking Because He looks like a real psycho killer.....You have Must to watch this movie....."
" Ultimate movie with powerful dialogues & action
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,10,"Nawazuddin siddiqui showed realistic impression of a serial killer. He delivered impressive dialogues!!! Major credit goes to Anurag and Nawazuddin. You may not predict how the next scene appears. Unfortunately this movie didn't get popularity due to Mich violence gore...
At last not important to the movie but important to the masala fans...actress Shobita D nude sex scene (never done before) blows your mind away"
" Friendship of art and cruelty.
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,8,Nawanuddin Siddiqui again reached on the hinghest peak of acting. Anurag Kashyap has drawn new painting of thriller of bollywood cinema. As a psychological-thriller it is one of the best. Acting of Nawazuddin Siddiqui put this film it's own succes.
" A masterpiece that was made a few years earlier than it's time.
",2019-10-07 00:00:00,10,The current views on the movie shows that this masterpiece was made earlier than it's time. Now there is not one person who would change the channel if the movie is on. The same people who complained it to be dark during its release are enjoying it now.An oscar level acting by Nawazuddin. I still get goosebumps watching this movie and everytime I notice some new acting brilliance by Nawas. Vicky was also top notch playing a drug addicted cop. The cat and mouse chase between Nawaz and Vicky is amazing. It was dark and that is what you should be expecting when you know its being helmed by Anurag.It did not disappoint me at all. I can watch it another 100 times and still not be bored of it. If this movie was released in late 2018 or 2019 it would have been a box office hit for sure.
" This movie will make you saint
",2019-08-31 00:00:00,10,"What i thought it delivered1. Killings happens everyday around us and the first question we ask or being told to us is ""why is he/she got killed?"". Unfortunately some of us settle down on a reason or start taking a stand, eg. Honor killings, revenge story, relationship cheating etc.
So here, Anurag take away all the ""reasons"" and shows the brutality of killing. Many of us don't like the fact that Raman is killing people without any reason. If we think like that, then we should rethink, ""resons"" never justify killings. Murdering someone is wrong and it can't be justified.2. Anurag shows violence as brutally as it should be. He didn't glorified it. Not like a macho man, a hero jumping and hitting and beating people. Anurag's violence don't inspire people to get violent. Rather it will make you repulsive to it.3. In a movie all violence is off screen, left on your imagination, so rather that pointing how violent movie is, we can rather see how violent i am."
" Dark but beautiful
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,10,It is very dark some may find it disturbing too but the direction and acting is just amazing. Anurag Kashyap at it's best.
" Cult Classic Made by One Only Anurag Kashyap
",2019-05-30 00:00:00,10,"Raman Raghav 2.0 is psychological thriller film
If This Film release in Hollywood It's Going 101% Sure to Oscar. A Gift to Indian Cinema to world
How Cult film is this. Every Moment Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Vicky Kausal Make this Film Perfect with his acting. Must Watch for Cult Movie Lovers

" Good watch
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,8,Extremely well directed film .. Not boring for a minute .
" Horror thriller
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,6,Once watchable...Once watchable...Once watchable...Once watchable...
" Good try but lots of loose ends
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,6,"Good try on many new fronts but leaves a lot of lose ends which they show as if they don't.
Liked the ""sister "" chapter. Others are very diluted. No cat-mouse as described in synopsis on Netflix. That was a huge miss as cop doesn't even try to solve! Actors are fine . Direction is good but story needs more attention."
" Best movie on the subject from India, I know of.
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,7,"There are many movies out there which carry the theme defining serial killers. When it comes to portray reality, psychologists go with the most correct movie to be 'no country for old men'. There was a time when I liked the movies American psycho and No country for old men. I am happy I don't any more, in fact I hate them. On the other hand I totally disliked the movies The silence of the lambs and I am happy for that.Further comes the part including movies I am Okay with. They are The Zodiac (real life based), Identity, Murder 2 and Ek Villian.To follow, I like The girl with the dragon tattoo, Changeling, I saw the Devil and Se7en mostly because how it ends.To add further I like Mr. Brooks and Monster as well.Then comes the movie directed by India's Reality King Anurag Kashyap Raman Raghav 2.0. The movie is entertaining and mostly because the cast of Nawazuddin Siddiqui and the direction provided. It is the best act from Siddiqui till date.Final Verdict: I like the movie (even with theme involving serial killers) because of the same reason why we all like such movies. I am happy that I could slide out some of them as most disliked."
" A tight slap upon the Indian hypocrisies
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,10,"This is much more than just a movie. This is a satire over the existing state of affairs; over the masks that we wear to hide our evil and call ourselves civilized. The evil today does not have a face, it is present in all of us in some form or the other. Some hide it under the banner of religion, caste and other identities. Indian can no more tolerate these hypocrisies. Though a story based upon a serial killer, Raman this story successfully highlights the hidden aspects of our society as well. 
And what comes in mind when it comes to acting, other than Nawaz bhai. A marvelous piece of acting that rightly showcases the character. And the combo of Anurag and Nawaz- what can be better than this. Both excel in their fields. It is evident from the screenplay the efforts put up in the movie making. Anurag has researched a lot, travelled a lot probably to get us the deep details of slums and low income families and so on. And the satires they were excellent- one was the Babaji with a brand new Goggle...haha. What a shame on these religious jokers. The dialogue delivery was awesome. Also add-on the Vicky Kaushal, an emerging star of Bollywood who dares to give us some quality content rather than playing with few items songs and earning money. 
You will love to watch it, especially if you dislike hypocrites......full on bang on!!!"
" His final scene in the movie, where he explains his motive, while finding his soulmate to carry on his legacy is beautiful, bringing out his acting caliber.
",2017-11-06 00:00:00,7,"Anurag Kashyap is back into direction and thankfully in the 'Ugly' mode, than in the mold of the unholy offspring with Karan johar (something Velvet).The movie begins with an unexpected disclaimer that it is in no way related to Raman Raghav, a psychopathic serial killer from Mumbai in 1960's. That did help reduce the budget which would have been required to make a 'period' film, while the title helped catch enough buzz without the marketing spends.The review deserves to be written in 2 parts, first about Nawazzudin's performance and then the flaws. We are first introduced to 'Ramanna' as a voice over a call to the police station, in the form of a murder informant, but the wait is short before Anurag brings him to the screen as a self-confessed serial killer (9 as per his count), story about his first murder being illustrated with his glistening eyes and hand gestures. Even though audience loves the story, police doesn't, and we see him again out on the shady / littered streets of Mumbai amongst a pair of fighting rats and thin cats, sitting smug and comfortable, as if he belongs there. Through multiple chapters guiding the story, the serial killer continues his murdering spree which is done in grotesque manner, not with cold calculation, but with seething anger and passion. The actor aces it in a conversation with a 6 year old child where he explains his twisted logic for the crimes. As an escape artist, we are hardly surprised when he's shown submerged in a sewage drain to escape cops, and emerges to murder the traitor who baited him. The sheer aura of madness he brings to the screen not withstanding his small and lean body profile, scares the audience who keep guessing his next move. The ability to be invisible as a common man in a crowd also helps him. His final scene in the movie, where he explains his motive, while finding his soulmate to carry on his legacy is beautiful, bringing out his acting caliber.Now, to the flaws. Agreed, this wasn't a biography. But, some background on the lead character would've helped, we get none except some indications about a violent childhood from his sister. Then, we would have needed a start. The first murder, it's motive brushed aside as a vengeance for child labour seemed meek. Also, the development of the character, the reason for becoming a serial killer is pushed under the carpet. The second protagonist, the shades-wearing disco hopping cop (who wears the uniform only for one scene), unnecessarily gets a lot of screen time. Although the director does try to justify this towards the climax, it falls through. Credit must go to the camera man and the location scouts for showing us a part of Mumbai we aren't proud of, but have to live with. Also, for Anurag for bringing out again that there's a dark side within every common man.Would recommend this for anyone who loves to watch Nawazzudin perform. For those who hope for another Anurag special, sorry he's way far from his best."
" It's dark,goads the question of morality
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,9,"It has been many days to see a hard-boiled noir like RR2. Characters have been portrayed very well and this thing does the half job for the movies. Nawazuddin is undoubtedly one of the strongest actors in the contemporary Bollywood cinemas, Vicky Kaushal's appearance, acting and style suits with the theme and weather. Vicky's sun glass-worn rigid, cold look, drug addiction, misogyny and rough attitude sways him from typical heroic to antagonist role. There wasn't a single moment where the tension gets loosed, such a well-directed movie. The use of lights and shadows in the night scenes gives the feeling to the audience about the crudity. In the last dialogues, Nawazuddin throws some moral questions to us, the brute side of humans which lurks among us always but we hardly accept it. People kill their mates for money, vengeance, communal disputes, nationalism blah blah... he kills only for his pleasure, not like a masked hypocrite."
" Review - Raman Raghav 2.0 (2016)
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,7,"Anurag Kashyap's flair for churning out unconventional cinematic pieces is something that warrants appreciation. Raman Raghav 2.0 is certainly not a film that you could expect out of a run-of-the-mill filmmaker. The director (who has also co-written the screenplay along with Vasan Bala) is known for not making compromises in the name of 'commercial cinema' and with RR 2.0, he simply reinstates this verity.The film is divided into different chapters that delve deep into the state of mind of the hunter and the hunted. The pacing of the first half is pitch-perfect and the director succeeds in (metaphorically) grabbing the viewers by the throat and pasting them on a wall, subjecting them to the murderous and drug-infested backdrop of the central characters Ramanna (played by Nawazuddin Siddiqui) and Raghavan (played by Vicky Kaushal) respectively. The noticeable factor in Kashyap's films is the subtle maintenance of tone. He never attempts to overrun genres simply for the sake of it. The undercurrent of dark humor is not forced at all. You barely know the characters that Ramanna murders (most of the time, except for his sister's family) as he picks them mostly on a random basis. The viewer is never handed out an option to feel exceptionally grim just because a murder took place. We know that they are going to continue because Ramanna is Ramanna. Nawazuddin makes sure Ramanna stays in our minds for quite a long time. The scar on his head, the earrings, the sunglasses (which he procures midway through the film), the shabby garments that he wears, his wry smile, pretty much everything is on-point. Said to be based on a real-life serial killer, Nawaz coerces us to buy into his outlandish perspectives with ease.The surprise element here is Vicky Kaushal's character Raghavan. He is no super-cop. He is a drug-addict who treats his woman badly, and is almost disowned by his father (which is portrayed through an incident). There is barely anything that he clings himself onto, except for his steady intake of cocaine. The character sketch is comparatively hazy in the beginning but the scenes in the latter half shed ample light on his psyche. Kaushal maintains a deadpan expression throughout, which is pretty much all that is required of him. He is revealed to be an insomniac as well, and wears sunglasses all the time, even in the middle of the night, to conceal his sleeplessness and lethargy. Sobhita Dhulipala in a de-glam avatar plays her part sublimely. In fact, hers is the only character in the film that sanctions a bit of empathy.Musical score by Ram Sampath complements the mood of the film pretty well and the songs are not mere gap-fillers. They convey the internal turmoil of the characters rather deviously. ""Qatl-e-Aam"", ""Behooda"" and ""Paani Ka Rasta"" are all decently rendered. The film mostly shuttles between the slums and lowly neighborhoods of Mumbai. The guerrilla-styled cinematography is reasonably delightful and takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride, with deliberate slacking in pace at certain occasions. The stand-out scene IMO would be the one where Ramanna elucidates how Raghavan is his soul-mate, and how the two are going to be inseparable. Pure stroke of genius!Kashyap is righteously back-to-form with Raman Raghav 2.0 and as a viewer, I sincerely hope he continues to make the world, and not just Bollywood, perceive his work."
" In the mood for ...
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,6,"If you're thinking about watching this, hopefully not singing and dancing. And it's funny that IMDb suggests Bollywood movies on the page this is promoted. It could not be further away from what this movie is about. And while there are still restrictions on things being able to be shown on screen, this is as vivid as it gets in Indian horror genre cinema some would argue.And there is a case to be made. Whenever you have some sort of shackles or guidelines to follow, the creative mind takes a leap of faith. Something the viewer has to do too. It's not an easy movie to watch, for many reasons. And those who are looking to be pleased with violence might feel a bit underwhelmed. Hopefully I put that to rest. Visually on a cinematography level though this is really something to watch. It may have story issues and the gimmick does not always work, but it's still a very interesting experiment ..."
" A movie that touches the monster inside you
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,9,"Imagine yourself committing a crime regardless of its nature or degree, the first thing that your conscious tells you that the action you are performing is wrong lawfully or in value. Reason : Wisdom. So what drives a serial killer insane? Raman Raghav 2.0 tells us such a tale.The movie follows the story of two such identities: a serial killer inspired by the famous RAMAN RAGHAV who claims that he can talk to YAMA and his killings are a result of their conversation & a cop drenched so deep into intoxication that he's unable to sleep. But this movie is not about the usual killings and the manhunt of the unidentified. Raman Raghav 2.0 focuses on how two men are different from each other and yet so similar & how the monster inside somehow connects both of them. Ramanna(Nawazuddin Siddqui) is a slum dweller who kills for any reason let that be the person drunk driving and confronting him or someone who is just sleeping on the road but above all he kills because 'he has to' just like he eats food or drinks water. On the other side of the story is Raghavan(Vicky Kaushal), a senior police inspector addicted to drugs who can go to any degree just to hide this fact from the whole police department. In between is Simmy(Sobhita Dhulipala), the girlfriend of Raghavan madly in love with him but unafraid of his psychic anger. What follows is a thrilling game of cat and mouse between both the men where the hunter is being hunted & people being killed and all for a paranoid reason.Nawaz with this character proves that there are few better than him in the industry at the moment. He performs the role so convincingly so can't question him in even a single frame. Sobhita Dhulipala is subtle and holds her character impressively but her character is largely one-dimensional. The star of the movie though is Vicky Kaushal. The anti-hero abused by his father in childhood, Vicky with his rugged face, bristling eyes & addiction to drugs has owned the character which is completely in contrast to the roles in his earlier movies.A genius in Anurag Kashyap has taken this movie to another level with his direction.Bollywood's best psychological thriller."
" Disappointing movie
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,4,I normally don't watch a movie until I know that the movie has really good reviews. I made an exception for this movie and it totally disappointed me. I think a great script and a talent like Nawazuddin was wasted. The movie did not feel scary at any point and I am not sure what the director wanted to prove here. I was very excited as it is not common to see an Indian movie on a psychopath (from the 60s). I thought it would be something like a Quentin Tarantino movie.
" A movie about two extremely negative characters..
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,1,"Just like his earlier film Paanch, this film too portrays characters without morals..Paanch was a disappointment in that sense and so is this movie. Both characters are bent on killing and covering up their crimes whether it is Raghav who kills 3 children through his girlfriends abortions..or whether it is Ramanna who kills whomever he targets just to get the attention of cop Raghav. Both Nawaz Siddiqui and Vicky Kaushal give decent performances but the Story lacks morals and moralistic characters..just a message to Mr.Kashyap please try to portray some positivity in your movies...you never have any good in your films maybe this is just your worldview of how you have seen real life..which is why you continue to churn out movies like this"
" Trade mark Anurag Kashyap movie
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,8,"Sickening to it's core (Read: Must watch)! A typical A Kashyap movie which moves your guts up in your throat. You feel present in the scenes and actually things happening around you. I watched it after reading somewhere that it is was mentally draining for N Siddiqui while he was performing the role in the movie. And the cast has delivered it; while you feel the emotions of the actors building up inside you, you can sense the cramped up lanes, the stench of slums and people looking at you in the movie. Must watch if you are a fan of dark movies. Rest of the cast is equally good; Vicky Caushal keeps moving between the villain and the guy you sympathize with. Vipin Sharma has a short but very stinging role The female cast is equally good, especially, Amruta Subhash, who leaves a mark on your mind and once you get out of Raman's affect, you keep guessing if she was really the partner in crime with him. Anurag Kashyap keeps his legacy."
" A Nawazuddin Siddiqui Masterclass
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,7,"The movie title is a clever riff. At first I was thinking it is a sequel but the opening title cards reassured me it isn't. It is about a demented dude who draws inspiration from an actual infamous psycho killer. The movie has a lot of missteps - the lack of a cat and mouse A game, flimsily drawn female characters and a cop whom I can't sympathise with, but yet it is compulsively watchable for one reason - Nawazuddin Siddiqui. I couldn't tear my eyes off him. How he delivers his lines with an undercurrent of cold menace and a heavy cloud of sinister underpinning is just perfect. He is a psychopath personified. God have mercy on your soul if you are trapped in the same room as him. I read in an article that he had to be hospitalised for dengue for a few days during the filming and all through the duration he was uttering lines from his demented character. I know I shouldn't trust the internet, but I would like to believe this. What an intense performance!Herein IMHO lies the main problem with the movie. Siddiqui's Raman is so powerful and singular that it eclipses the entire movie. It doesn't help that Kaushal's Raghav hides behind sunglasses most of the time and his character so thinly drawn as compared to his counterpoint. I couldn't finish the movie and had 10 minutes left when my plane landed. It is testament that the film had me in its pocket as all through my holiday I was hoping the movie is still available for selection as it had crossed into a new month. First thing I did when I sat down for my trip home was to see if the movie was still in rotation. A sly smile must have been plastered on my face as I finished the last ten minutes as the plane taxied to the runway. All the questions from the various plot threads have been answered satisfyingly."
