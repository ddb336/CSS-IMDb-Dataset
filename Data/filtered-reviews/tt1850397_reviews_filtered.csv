" Entertaining
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,7,A very well made 'who done it thriller' which has some very good plot twists. Though the ending was over dramatic.
" Just a simple story with some revealing
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,6,Storyline wasn't really good. It's just simple movie until the girl's deadbody is found. But framing a friend in this murder was interesting and rest of the story Isn't good enough.
" If not for the ending, 10 stars
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,5,"It's an amazing story well portrayed by actors and directing, but the ending. The ending forcibly tends to surprise the viewer, when the architecture of the whole plan is well structured by one of the characters. Despite his accuracy, he is easy overwhelmed because of his emotionality for no apparent reasons, when he faces his mate in the last scene, so to get that exact epilogue. The movie ends without any possibility of redemption for the real victims of the intrigues perpetrated by cynical men: the women they used and betrayed as puppets. In my opinion, would have been preferable an epilogue where both the main involved mates and the viewer itself understand the truth by any circumstance like a clue, or an evidence, or the plan devised in the mind of its creator, showing the real nature of the deception with the aim his mates were stuck to their responsibilities to understand the consequences and the suffering of any deception they made."
" Awful
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,3,"The only good thing was how hot Karl Urban Looks, period. Bad plot twist, bad acting choices and bad script!"
" Twists Upon Twists
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,8,A very well done intrigue. Very intricate plot. Well cast and well acted. Keeps you on the edge of your seat.
" The Loftiest Trash
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,3,"This is such an over-stylized mess of toxic masculinity and chauvinism. 5 rich guys get a super high end loft they can use as a safe haven for their extra-marital affairs and unspeakable proclivities. I generally really like Karl Urban and I think he and James Marsden are often underrated in Hollywood but this was such a waste of them both. There's a murder, interchangeable blondes and a lot of overtly sexual conduct. Lower the production values and shuffle a couple things and shift the focus of the movie and it's basically your standard Lifetiime nonsense.Not worth your time. Definitely not worth paying for in any regard. Even if you're just looking for a flick for some cheap thrills this doesn't deliver on that. It really just falls short in almost every category. Pure style, no substance. Definite pass."
" Good worthwhile drama
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,6,"I liked this. The acting was great. Likeable characters. Very sexy guys in this...total babes. Pretty girls too & without uncomfortable sex scenes & nudity. I believe this movie could've even been better somehow with the ending being played out differently. It felt so rushed at the end. It was too much information to process. Instead of it all rushing to a revealed conclusion by the one guy who taped everyone, why couldn't it of been revealed differently. Maybe someone finds a tape? I don't know but when he took everyone back & played the tapes it didn't work well for me because it was so rushed & my brain couldn't process it that fast. I just really fell in love with these acters & actresses & the story was cool. It just needed to be slowed down a bit. The ending felt so rushed."
" 2020 I wasn't expecting much but woaahh.
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,9,"I mean according to reviews it looked just like casual evening detective story but what I just saw. Sometimes I just feel like these movies are over now but this one just reminds me why I love movies with complicated stories, all those clues and secrets so much!"
" solid mystery/thriller
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,8,"Great story line, keeps you guessing til the last 20 minutes.
good acting and direction, copper bottom hit!5 pals buy an apartment, and come across a dead woman, but none of them own up to it, so its a story going back and forth in an attempt to find the killer!!
well worth a watch, novel idea, good movie,"
" My favorite thriller genre...!!!
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,8,Actually it is remake from other language but really it surprise me and story is between 5 married friends..but still the story wasnt simple and non linear screenplay..amazing thriller to watch and worth to watch onemore time for understand whole plot and all castings..
" Points for the concept, and for a few scanty bits of eye candy, but otherwise this is a major whiff
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,3,"A group of five middle-aged guys share the only keys to a private, secret condo expressly for their extramarital affairs. One morning, a bloodied dead woman is found in the bedroom and the arguing and finger-pointing begins. This seemingly has all the ingredients for a great small-scale tension cranker, but ambition gets the best of it, it tries to go large, and the whole thing blows to bits on the launchpad. It's terribly acted, for one, which is something of a surprise given the healthy careers enjoyed by its stars. Karl Urban and James Marsden are well-seasoned, even if they aren't exactly leading men, and Eric Stonestreet - while miscast in a very adult role - should at least know how to carry himself on the screen. Instead it's amateur hour, where limp first-takes abound, and the finished product is something I would expect from a bit of Cinemax softcore, not a polished big-budget production. I don't care about, or even remotely like, a single one of the characters, the writing goes around in circles seeking every possible twist, and the ending really doesn't even make any sense. Points for the concept, and for a few scanty bits of eye candy, but otherwise this is a major whiff."
" Honest Review!
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,7,"The Loft (The ones that you love are the ones that are gonna hurt you) take it seriously, i liked the idea of the movie it is mixed with three genre's romance,thriller and mystery the mysterious part was the reason i watched it, the plot looks interesting so expect strange things to happen, what i liked most about it there is five guy's behind every one there is a secret behind every secret there is a reason behind every reason there is a payment that they have to pay it, the connection between the five guy's that just gets deeper into the topic with all it's back stories is apparently interesting that catches the viewers intention to itself, it is well acted but the main conclusion of the story was a bit clumsy for what all happened, so this movie has actually flopped in money earnings that doesn't deserve it because it's better than most movies in its range, at last it will give you a good message itself so just put it on, 7/10⭐"
" Clear storyline but nothing super special
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,7,This movie's main conflict is simply the fact that they're married and don't have the guts to be honest with themselves.
" You'll never guess! A great thriller
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,10,"Sure it's pretty trashy but hey, it's a thriller in the grand style of 'who did it?'
This little baby will keep you on the edge of your seat right up until the final reveal. It's got all the ingredients of a classy thriller so I'm baffled by all the low scores...what on earth did they want? The Loft is well directed, well acted and certainly well above your average film in this genre. If Agatha Christie was re-born as a hipster film-maker she'd probably come up with a convoluted but exciting story like this.
It ain't Tarantino but it's quite a ride. If you pick the culprit you're a very clever puppy!"
" Pretty good
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,9,"This movie is actually a pretty good one. The plot is very interesting. Plus, you have So many good looking guys in one movie. What can you wish for more?"
" Boring
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,2,"Boring but they made it convoluted with jumping back and forth in time, so instead of interesting it just became hard to follow, the plot does not make sense. Visually it is very poor too, which is surprising as there was not too much job to do. Don't watch it, waste of time."
" my notes
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,4,This is a bad movie. but i still found it dumb-ly entertaining. some bad acting and questionable parts (1 viewing)
" An exciting thriller
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,8,An exciting thriller with a surprising twist. recommendable
" My opinion
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,6,"Same movie as Loft (2008). Though it is at least a year since I have seen original this movie did not do a thing to me. Either previous version is more interesting, or I spoiled this one by watching older movie. As if it is redone shot by shot. The director did not change anything, no new perspective, nothing....
I cannot give it more than 6, though original I enjoyed very much."
" Loved it. Don't listen to the critics.
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,8,"When I stumbled on this film on one of my Netflix binges I gave it a quick search and noticed a lot of critics gave it very negative reviews. I decided to give it a watch anyway (great decision) and I loved every second.I won't bother explaining the plot as I am sure you get the gist from the IMDb page, but it is essentially a murder mystery, thriller.
I watched this with my brother and we spent the entire time guessing who could have done it? And giving out conspiracies as to who killed this woman. It kept you in suspense the entire time as it literally could have been anyone. The ending also did not disappoint. I was genuinely shocked by who killed the woman.I gave an 8 just purely, because I would have liked to have seen where a few of the characters ended up etc however this does not take anything away from the movie. Great film, that makes you think. Highly recommend."
" Enjoyed that thoroughly
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,9,That was class it had more twists and turns than a theme park ride. I watched it with my bro and we didn't say a word to each other the entire time because we was so invested in this.
" Overall good film
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,6,"If your looking for an easy to watch film then this is the one, not to say it's boring or not great in anyway. I'm not going to give an suppliers away but I'm going to say the acting is good with a great cast involved, the script and story line are well wrote and no real plot holes in the film. It gives you teasers through out but it does leave you guessing until the end. Just a quick review but I'd say worth a watch."
" A wonderful idea whose screenplay goes down the drain
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,5,"The loft is wonderful on a idea level. It does peak interest with the kind of thriller it is. But the screenplay written for feature film becomes illogical as the film goes by.When nearly 3/4th of the film is done, it is clear that everything could have been out in the very first sequence if not the very first scene itself. The writer(s) just wanted to make it a thriller and hence did not disclose moments that would have been disclosed if the death of the woman happened in real life. While writing a thriller or a suspense drama one not only needs to know what to hold back and what not to, but also if that would make sense or not to the story.It's definitely worth a watch but doesn't live up to good writing. It could have had been a good thriller had there been nothing beyond the culprit getting caught. They just had to pull the story to make it more thrilling."
" YOUR LITTLE SISTER IS SERIOUSLY HOT
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,8,"The movie starts off with a murdered blond whose face we don't get to see for quite a while. The film is told with select flashbacks to the guys discovering the corpse and the formation of the Loft and before and not always in chronological order so not to reveal the whole story until the end.Five professionals decide to share a loft in order to bring women there where their always suspecting wives won't be able to follow any money trail. The blond appears to be a woman introduced as a politician's aide whose boss is possessive. We also have 5 wives as suspects too. As the film goes on the plot reveals more of itself. It is made to seem complex due to the nature on how we are given clues.The film leaves clues, but there is no way to tie them into anything. And PLOT SPOILER we don't always see what actually happened and have no way of knowing that until the end. It is a mystery that tries to be clever, but not good.Guide: F-bomb, sex. No nudity."
" A Fantastic Little Thriller
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie. The cast is excellent, the plot keeps you guessing and there are several twists in the film that neither the characters nor the audience see coming.Five lifelong friends, Vincent (Karl Urban), Chris (James Marsden), Luke (Wentworth MIller),Marty (Eric Stonestreet) and Phillip (Matthias Schoenarrts) share a secret loft for cheating on their wives. One morning, there is a dead blond covered in blood on the bed in the loft. The five friends all start accusing each other. The story then flashes back to the weeks leading up to the crime and gives you plenty of reasons to suspect any or all of them. Vincent is an architect who tried to leverage a political leader. Chris is cheating on his very scary wife (Rhona Mitra) with an emotionally unavailable woman, Anne (a gorgeous Rachel Taylor). Luke might have feelings for Vincent that go beyond friendship. Marty is a loudmouth, obnoxious drunk. Phillip is a sadistic druggie.The cast does a fantastic job of playing these successful, but very flawed men. Each one could have conceivably killed the girl. The plot gets thrilling when each man starts blaming the other while trying to defend who he is not the killer. The simplest thing would be to just call the cops and let them sort it out, but then the wives would find out about the loft and all five men might be accessories to murder.The reveal of the killer(s) and the resolution were top-notch in my opinion. Even after finding out ""who done it"" the characters still make stupid, but very human decisions. That's what I loved about the film. The killer(s) identity doesn't end the suspense.My only issue with the film is the short attention paid to the female characters. The wives are one-dimensional and are just there to provide someone for their husband's to cheat on (ex. Rhona Mitra just glares at her husband in every scene. She has made a career out of glaring, but she's still lovely to look at). The other two female characters of Anne and Sarah (Isabel Lucas) are underwritten and poorly utilized (and one of them is the poor soul on the bed).. These characters could have been fleshed out better so they were more integral and integrated into the plot. As it is, they just feel kind of tossed in.I'm sure there is a backstory as to why the studio put this movie on the shelf for almost 3 years. It was filmed in 2011 and not released until 2014. I'd love to hear why. Its a neat little thriller and has enough suspense to keep you guessing. The actors/actresses give it their all and the ending(s) catch you off-guard."
" Bombastically overdone and unsubtle... but I rather loved it.
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,7,"A strange but thoroughly enjoyable film. Almost everything about this quirky, old-style thriller is overdone - especially the music, which is excellent, symphonic, and hilariously brash, booming and thundering through every scene.The respectable ensemble cast chew enthusiastically on the scenery while barking out overwritten, melodramatic dialogue and simultaneously maintaining straight faces throughout. No mean feat.The superb, classy, and heavily stylised lighting is a master class in noir-esque cinematography, unsubtly complimented with intensely over-the-top rain effects.Nothing about this film is subtle or underplayed. And it doesn't need to be. It's pure fun, escapism, and self-indulgence, with stylistic nods to movies of a bygone age. I liked it a lot, and was even surprised at the end by who ""done"" it, and that doesn't happen often!"
" Banal copy of original film
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,5,"Conversations, intonations, events - all is a banal copy of the 2008th film. The difference is only in the mimicry of the actors. Because the actors are different. That's all."
" Welcome to cliche country
",2018-04-20 00:00:00,2,"I, like another user, have just opened an account so that I can warn people against this movie. Don't get me wrong it's bad in a funny sort of way but don't listen to anyone who says it has suspense or mystery! The script is one cliche after another for the whole movie and gives men such a bad rep im glad my wife fell asleep watching it. The psychiatrist character is the most vacant looking and wide eyed mental health professional i could ever imagine existing, in fact the only passable character was the new york guy from ""the drop"". God i hate men after this, we are such a bunch of b******s"
" Satisfying
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,8,"It confuses me why some great movies like this have subpar ratings and others are completely overrated. Of all the boring Saturday movies I've watched on Netflix, this one remains my favorite. It's best to go into this movie knowing as little as possible. If you love thrillers and ""who did it"" type movies, this will be a satisfying movie to you. I've read some complaints about the ending, but I disagree. The ending was fairly realistic, and that made it satisfying to me. It's not an Oscar worthy movie, but it's a good guilty pleasure movie, especially for a Netflix day."
" It's actually not as bad as others are saying...
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,5,"I started off deciding to watch just a bit of this movie for fun based on the entertaining terrible reviews -- especially one review in particular by a user who said they created an account just to report how awful it was (and it's their sole review on this site so they were serious lol). With that in mind, I decided I must get a glimpse of this awfulness for myself and hoped to have a few laughs.I actually ended up watching the entire thing and thought it was decent. My extremely low expectations probably helped, but it's definitely an alright movie. I was engaged throughout.Sure, the acting and dialogue at times are bad, but overall the mystery and (most) twists hold up on their own.I think if Eric Stonestreet's character and his wife in the movie were given different dialogue (or even omitted all together from the movie), it could have made the entire experience much better. Honestly, they're the main ones to blame for the majority of the cringeworthy moments. Also, if they had cast a better actress to play the dead woman that could've helped as well.Honestly though, overall it's really not that bad."
" Amazing twists...
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,10,"I think this is the maximum number of plot twists that can be put in a single movie. The story line is good, beatifically laid out. Many plot twists, you will never see any of them coming."
" Watch the Dutch version.
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,2,"Great storyline if it is well acted, which this one isn't. Originally a Belgian movie, later better remade in the Netherlands (where I'm from). I absolutely love the Dutch film, I really hate this one."
" Underrated Good Movie!!
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,8,"Underrated Good Movie with a great choise of actors, every one of them did his part perfectly.
the Plot is good with very thrilling moments and that what makes me thought of its very underrated"
" Just Awful - Let Me Count the Way....
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,1,"All of the characters are sleezebags and/or stupid. The hooker with the heart of gold, the five cheating frenemies, the stupid, clingy, unhappy wives, the dumb sleezy pickup artist who was stupid enough to think some rich guy was going to leave his wife for her.Dumb, dumb, dumb...let me count the ways...1. You don't try to stage a dead body after 10 hours or so...there's something called lividity, which means the blood has pooled, so when you find a body lying on its back and you turn it over on its stomach, the coroner, unless, he or she is as stupid as you are, is going to figure out this dead body, which when it was alive supposedly committed suicide, didn't.2. See above. this also goes along with cutting it's wrist after the fact. The body was already dead, dummy, just leave it as it was. Don't cut it's wrists and hack it up. Again, forensics will determine the blood flow, that the heart wasn't pumping, that the blood is old, blood splatter, etc. Remember you are trying to make this a suicide - not a murder by a butcher who hung around to do more damage to a dead body long after the fact.3. She was dead and left a suicide note, why did you have to do anything with the body???4. If you are going to kill someone with an injection, don't do it in their arm, put a spot where the sun don't shine and hope a thorough examination doesn't find the injection spot.5. After moving a dead body after it's been dead for hour, sob all over it and leave your freaking DNA, skin, and haircells, why don't you . We already know your stupid. 6. How do you still have a key to a crime scene, where you and the actual murderer could get in? Wouldn't the cops change the locks and secure it would more than tape, confiscate the keys???7. A murderer decides to explain everything to a guy wearing a coat, has a cellphone and possibly a wire??? Really bad film-making and writing.8. Why trust a coke-head, out of control moron to cover up the crime? What did you expect a nut-job like him would do? Why didn't you recognize the problem after the fact either? Isn't one of you idiots supposed to be a doctor, haven't you watched The Forensic Files, Law & Order, any cop show??? Ever heard of DNA??? See #1 and 2 above9. You're all liars and cheaters, why would *any* of you trust the other guy???10. The character with the supposed moral compass (he's shtupping the hooker) is as sleazy as the rest of them. Please don't attempt to make it the good guy. He's cheating on his wife and kids. Really? Did he think he was just going to have a cup of coffee with a woman who told him she wasn't wearing a panties in public? He resisted her ""charms"" for, what, like 10 seconds?11. The hooker with the heart of gold...really?12. Is that ending supposed to be upbeat? Get her tested for STDs man. Millions of women in the world, you're bored with your wife, and you pick a hooker?13. Why aren't they all going on trial or in jail for obstruction of justice and abuse of a corpse, lying to the police, and any number of broken laws?Stupid writing, stupid direction, stupid acting. Bad, just really bad, so bad, I had to sign in just to write how bad.And everyone looked unshaven, greasy, smelly, and like they needed a good bath. How anyone wanted to sleep with any of them for money or not is beyond me. Ewww..."
" Catchy to follow, but the twists are not convincing afterwards and the ending is insipid
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,7,"I have not seen the original Belgian film and was unaware of the plot, so my views are totally based on what I saw and how I perceived the progress and logic of the plot. I have to say that most of this 1.5 h or so film felt intriguing - the benchmark of events was thrilling, the leading performances were at least good (I found James Marsden and Wentworth Miller more versatile than others), but then a kind of over- sophistication started to prevail and their solutions did not seem realistic any more - in view of modern applications the police have today, or the doubtfulness of motives behind. Soon the unnecessary number of characters and scenes were included, bringing out certain mess in following the events... And the very ending was too trivial.So, not a flop, but nothing very special, and not recommended if you have previous knowledge of the wrongdoer or guess him too early."
" Good cast and plot set-up, ruined by weak script.
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,4,"If Billy Wilder's ""The Apartment"" had been a murder mystery, this would be it. A group of married men share a secret love nest for their extramarital trysts. The married men include Karl Urban, James Marsden, Eric Stonestreet, and two others. Their arrangement seems to be working just fine until they discover a dead woman in the loft and the group must then figure out which one of them is a murderer. It's not a bad set-up, but the film is all clichés and has so many twists and turns that the story goes well beyond stretching credulity. The film was written by Wesley Strick, who has a couple good films under his belt with the ""Cape Fear"" remake and ""Final Analysis,"" although I believe those films were good based upon the strength of their directors, Martin Scorsese and Phil Joanou respectively. The film is actually a remake of a film out of Belgium and this film's director, Erik Van Looy, directed both. Overall, the film is slickly made, has a solid cast, but falls apart as a result of the weak script."
" Maddening and disappointing
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,4,"The worst part of this movie is the conceit that we should feel any empathy for despicable human beings that have no redeeming qualities. The fact that several of the characters actually end up getting happy endings and reconciliations made me want to tear my hair out. I didn't feel one iota of sympathy for any of them. While there were a few interesting twists and turns, it didn't make up for a clunky script that felt as fake as the attempts to make ANY of the main characters into some kind of heroes."
" A box office flop, especially with critics, and yet..
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,8,".. a movie that's far more entertaining than most of the crap produced these days.Really nice acting, cringe-worthy characters (in a good way) played by talented & believable actors with a nice suspenseful/thrilling plot. I honestly thought I would hate it when I started watching it on BluRay, but wow, I sat through it all without even taking a bathroom break. Not going to spoil anything, except for the fact that this movie is another reason why the so called ""critics"" should not be listened to.Oh and watch it with your wife for the best experience."
" Awful movie; Please don't watch it
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,3,"# No Spoilers!Directed by Eric Van LooyStarring Karl Urban, Wentworth Miller and James MarsdenOverall: This movie is really bad and I definitely don't recommend you see it. Two semi-competent performances and the little amount of will to live I had left in me kept this movie from being a 1/10. It is just plain terrible and I beg of you not to see it. It's not so bad it's good; it's so bad it's awful.# Possible Spoilers!Good:1. Wentworth Miller does decent as Luc Seynaeve2. Karl Urban was okay as Vincent.3. I was reasonably interested in the movie throughout.Bad:1. All other actors were appalling2. Two grand, game changing twists were not needed. One was fine.3. Speaking of the twist, I guessed the final outcome within maybe 10 minutes of the film starting.4. Horrific cinematography.5. Even the minuscule effects used were awful.3/10"
" The original Belgian version was better but this one is also fine.
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,7,"I have a couple of questions after watching The Loft. The first one is why some people don't like this movie? If you wanted to watch a mystery thriller then this is what you got. There's no way in hell you could see the end coming. That's what makes a mystery thriller standing out from the rest. A good story with some twists you don't see coming. My second question is why do we need to remake a movie that has been made before and even better? I saw the Belgian version of 2008 before and even if it is the exact copy of this version the original was even better. So why spending all that money on a movie that already exists? Just put some subtitles under the Belgian version and you got an even better movie. Saves you money and time. And if you watched this version of The Loft to see Matthias Schoenaerts play in it than you could have watched the original version as well because he plays in both movies. That must be a premiere I think. Anyways, even though I preferred the original version I still think this one was also good. Good story with good twists and with a good cast. What else do you want on a movie night?"
" Thriller with a twist
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,7,"The loft is a mind boggling thriller about five men who share a loft, where they will sometimes take women up there and cheat on their wives. One thing I'd like to say is that I got angry a lot throughout this movie just because of the animal like behavior of the sick men in this movie. There are like 2 characters in this movie that are clean and not adulterous, lying, cheating filthy people. Having that said, I liked the casting and I thought that every actor did their best to represent their role. James Marsden, Wentworth Miller, Karl urban, and Eric stonestreet all did a pretty good job. This thriller does have a somewhat surprising twist ending, which I always love and then just when you think you have everything all figured out, something else surprising occurs. I also don't think the movie was too short or too long, I think it had a suitable runtime. If you like entertaining mind boggling thrillers, then the loft is for you. It certainly could've been better, but I don't think it deserves all the hate that it's gotten. 7/10 for The Loft."
