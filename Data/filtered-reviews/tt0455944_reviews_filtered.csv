" Great Movie, Great Acting. Better than the 80's TV series ""The Equaliser""
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,10,"I don't intend to do a full review for this movie, it's already been done by others. Great Movie, Great Acting. Better than the 80's TV series ""The Equaliser"" about an ex-CIA-operative now living a quiet simple life reading books who goes on to using skills learnt in service, for the good of others who are unable to defend themselves. A true vigilante for the good, who enjoys giving pain and suffering to those who truly deserve it. Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) hard as nails, ""nails-it"" with a great performance. A must see if you don't mind a little well deserved violence. 10/10."
" The eding was way dumber than the entire movie.

",2021-03-10 00:00:00,9,Veterans all try to get justice themselves because they see that the law is inadequate so it's a good movie
" How are you all rating this so highly
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,3,Thought this film was going to end about 12 times and it just went on forever. Not good
" Denzel has the moves!
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,7,"An early scene in the workplace where Denzel claims to have been one of Gladys Knight's Pips shows he's got the moves and is great fun.He is really good in this as a calm but completely badass lead, but I want to give due credit to Mr Csokas for bringing us such a watchable and charismatic villain. Great performance!"
" Good but not Great
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,7,An action movie with very muted action. Still good though. Denzel acts well without the need for much dialogue. All in all it's just a bit too easy for my taste. Would have like some subterfuge.
" Active Movie
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,7,"I liked this more than I though I would, it kept me entertained."
" Way too much violence
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,6,"Could have been a great revenge movie, but the violence shown is ridiculous and fascist-like. Totally unnecessary."
" Takes suspension of disbelief to the max.
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,4,"The film starts off promisingly. Good atmosphere, good directing, cinematography and acting. You could be fooled into thinking a good story is about to unfold.Wrong! Dumbass, outrageously implausible action flick unfolds. Denzel walks about killing Russian mafia guy after Russian mafia guy. Walks into a room with 10 armed Russians. Takes them out, one at a time without a gun. Nobody shoots him, even though he moves like a snail. They wait for their turn to die.This is all to protect a young implausibly attractive prostitute from their evil clutches. BTW all the prostitutes in this film look like glamorous actresses. On her behalf, Denzel practically takes down the entire Russian mafia all on his won, without breaking a sweat, without any consequence. He can do all this because he was an ex-marine/intelligence officer, which means you're an indestructible killing machine regardless of age or physique. Which is good because Denzel looks like a scrawny .They actual made a sequel - Wouldn't be surprised if the plot revolved around him going back in time and destroying Hitlers army before the outbreak of WW2. Kills them all by himself. Takes out a whole platoon with his hands. Sneaks into the Chancellery, kills Hitler. All on behalf of a Jewish girl he meets who's grand parents were sadly killed during the occupation.Only watch this for laughs. Absolute Jokesville,"
" similar to Taken (2008)
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,10,"I liked this movie. Good topic, action, actors, skills, technology, feelings. Although it is negative, it is reasonable, logical, motivational. Bit more deep and brutal than Taken sequels of Liam Neeson, it is professional, and although it lacks emotions that Taken has, this has more action and skills. That is what I deserved from movie that lasts longer. Reminds me of real world topics and words like prostitution, human trafficking, and corruption. The main characters here looks like some savior, experienced, serious, but also sane, smart, moral. Comparable to real life topics and issues with the said topics of crime, corruption, dirty money... Can't wait to see next sequel."
" A solid OGWAG movie (One Guy With a Gun)
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,7,"Pretty much a standard OGWAG movie like his earlier Man on Fire, Jet Li's Kiss of The Dragon, or Liam Neeson's Taken.It's a genre that always is fun to watch and his cold blooded, mysterious-past having, jaded, dead man walking vibe is pretty much what you expect.Not a fantastic film, but solid if you're an OGWAG genre buff.I'd give it a 6.5 but I'll round up just because a 6 is slightly too low."
" This bloated dismal junk wastes Denzel completely.
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,1,"Classic film noir in particular shows us how ridiculously bloated films such as The Equalizer (2014) are. Its deranged 2 hr 12m run time is exhausting. Equalizer took 45 minutes to establish what The Narrow Margin (1952) fixed in one-fourth thatThe Equalizer actually bothers to give Denzel an hispanic buddy he's helping become a security guard to show you what a good guy he is. I'm amazed he doesn't also have a Chinese pal to nail that market.Not even an interesting character beat as in Seven where Morgan Freeman throws a knife into a dartboard, or sleeps to a metronome ticking. Here it's 'wrap the tea bag in a napkin.' Meanwhile the girl ""the equalizer"" is protecting has vanished for, what, at least an hour? What a script.Director Fuqua had the good fortune to luck into Training Day early in his career. Otherwise, he's a waste of hundreds of millions of dollars. Skip this junk."
" A must-watch
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,9,"This movie isn't perfect but no movie is. If you're looking for a movie full of action and amazing acting, I definitely recommend."
" Excellent Revenge Movie
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Oh Denzel is great in this, it's a real feel good revenge movie good versus evil."
" Denzel is better than the trama itself
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Denzel is great, even making a movie with poor and repeated story. It proves how a charismatic actor like him is important to save the show. The sequences are quite predictable and somehow boring in some aspects.This story shows how Russian girls are slaved by prostitution mafia. It's hard to accept situations like this. Why authorities don't go against it? Money and corruption, of course."
" Stupid, but what the heck; fun to watch
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,7,"Nothing new here; one man army with superhuman abilities rights the ills of society. Denzel gives a likeable performance, but his age makes the fight scenes truly ridiculous. However, despite the violence it is all good brutal fun."
" Enjoyable, even if the main character is a little too ""immortal"".
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,8,"It's satisfying seeing bad guys get what they deserve, and the Equalizer delivers on this premise very well. If you like seeing nasty, arrogant criminals getting their comeuppance, this movie (and the sequel) is for you.The only pitfall is a minor one. The protagonist played by Washington is a wee bit TOO untouchable. He's never really in any imminent, life-threatening danger that isn't easily handled by his ""Manchurian Candidate"" situational awareness combat mode. He's always the one dealing the cards and in 100% control of every situation.In other words, he walks into a situation and always comes out unscathed. This smacked me as a bit too watertight.One of the appeals of a hero/vigilante story is their story arc - rise, fall and rise again. It seems to me the main character has no real fall. It's more like he's reached the top and there is no bottom. He's basically a demi-god of sorts.Would rate the story one more star, possibly even 10 if they'd managed to make the main character less than immortal. There is a thrill seeing them overcome seemingly insurmountable odds, but it seems there were no odds for the Equalizer to surmount - he had it all figured out before the conflicts even started which is the movie's only weakness.Otherwise, outstanding acting by everyone involved, pacing was great, and overall a good story."
" Very Good Action Thriller
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,7,"This is a slightly more toned down version of the John Wick series. Not quite as intense as Wick but it has its moments of gore and action.
Washington is great in the lead and the badie played by Csokas is convincingly nasty.
We'll recommend action movie."
" Excellent Stunt Sequences
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,8,"Story line is simple. Denzel acting was outstanding, especially the fights he has nailed it. But while watching we shouldn't think logically."
" Spectacular lead, compelling storyline!
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,10,Watching Washington in an action role after long I had my qualms about it but he absolutely nailed it.Direction and sound track get full marks too!! Robert McCall is some who can be a great friend or your worst enemy.I love how he took help from his friends and didn't do this entirely on his own.
" A Great Pumped Up Version of the Tv Show
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,8,"Lots of fun, action and drama come together to create top notch entertainment.Denzel really owns this role and plays, what I felt, was a faithful performance to the original character. Just a badass dude helping his neighbours.Very nice action elements that tie in brilliantly with his life as a former agent, familiar with doing nasty things to nasty people.For something similar check out his Man on Fire remake :)"
" very good movie
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,9,"Robert Mc All works in a supermarket a lot of hours. he has insomnia, and a lot of images ih his past. he meets alina, a young prostitute (Moretz), But Alina dint work alone, the russian mafia kidnapped alina whwn she was a girl. one day Alina was bitten , Robert iniciate his revenge. Alina was in the hospital very damaged and alina""s friend(Haley Bennett( told Robert the methods of young girls sexual explotation. Alter this, Robert kilss one by one the russians and the corrupts americans, who work in narcotrafic, and sex explotation. At the end Alina receivve 9900 dollars from Robert, but anonymous, and she changed his old work....and his life.The end was fantastic."
" Absolutely ridiculous fighting skills
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,1,I was enjoying this film until the scene where the main character gets into a fight with some very nasty Russian gangsters who were armed with guns and knives and other lethal objects. His fighting skills are at least 1000 times superior to those of any human being who has ever lived. Even a cartoon character would have struggled to emulate them.In a comedy film that would have been great of course but in a serious film it was just ridiculous.I immediately stopped watching it and deleted it.
" You don't get service like this at B&Q
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,8,"I enjoy this film. Everytime I watch it. Yes we've seen it before. What action film isn't clichéd? But if you want to veg out and relax, this is pretty good to do that to. Good stuff from the 2 leading characters."
" A great action film with an amazing score
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,8,"I really do not expect this to be this good. It's perfect. If Taken can get a 9/10 then this should too.First of all, yes I am a huge action film fan. I liked the violence in this film. The ways of killing people are so creative.Special shout-out to the composer Harry Gregson-Williams! This film's music score is really good. It perfectly fits with the badass of Robert McCall.The fight scene in the mall is an example of good cinematography and good action. I always thought that the hero being too overpowered is always bad. The Equalizer proved me wrong!TLDR: A must-watch for action movie fans.Grade: A"
" Good looking but extremely dumb film...
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,5,"Action is nice, Denzel is fine, story is garbage...One lone super CIA hero crashes about 200 members of Russian mob including spetznaz warriors...I mean all American action films are unrealistic, but this one is just plain silly...To say the truth, it is also super tiresome to see forever pictured evil Russians...just by the size of their presence in US ,they are not the most formidable and large group of ruthless bandits. Just forever continuation of cold war ere fear mongering by corrupt US media)!5 stars for good action scenes!"
" A decent flick, but predictable
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,7,"If you've seen any great action movies the last 15-20 years, you'll see nothing new with the Equalizer. The movie was well made, acted, paced, directed, and entertaining.
Only complain I can really make of the movie, is that it's too formulaic: With other movies, like Taken (2008), Sherlock Holmes (2009), or even John Wick (2014), the plot is anything but unpredictable. If this wasn't the case, you would easily look at a 8/10 or maybe even 9/10 movie, in The Equalizer.Go give it a watch, if you haven't already."
" Hilarious
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,1,This movie is hilarious. Its like a liberal out of shape old man is beating everyone up with his slower then Steven Seagal Aikido. Hilarious. Oh yes and out of touch Hollyweird with there cops are Crooked. Yea cause tacos places makes so much money lmao. Hollywood has no writers anymore. But this was so funny it was watchable. Wouldve been even funnier if Denzel was using a cane to get around. Smfh
" Denzell Washington Makes A Movie With Antoine Fuqua
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,4,"Denzell Washington works at a Home Depot in Boston. When he isn't doing that, he sits in a diner, reading books and chatting with the other customers, including prostitute Chloe Grace Moretz, or helping an overweight security guard try to get in shape so he can become a rescue worker. Then Miss Moretz is kidnapped and beat to a pulp, and he proceeds to take down the Russian mob operation that killed her.it's a revival/prequel to the TV show from the 1980s, in which Edward Woodward would help small people fight back against the big nasties of the world. It was a pleasantly fantastic premise, and Washington, as always, convinces me that he is that man. Director Antoine Fuqua directs with his usual pornographic love of violence. It's appropriate here, although his director of photography, Mauro Fiore chooses an odd color palette that suggests that Home Depot only uses natural light, while the streets of Boston are lit by artificial light during the daytime."
" Great
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,9,Full action and funny moments. Great movie to watch
" It will be an unforgettable experience for fans of Denzel Washington's genius.
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,8,"The action thriller directed by Antoine Fuqua, and was released on 2014, starring Denzel Washington, Marton Sokas, Klose Grace Morets, David Harbor, Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo.
The film begins in a low rhythm and quickly reaches an explosive state shines brightly.
Robert McCall is a man with a mysterious past. Now he is a gentle and ordinary man who goes to work hard and leads a solitary life as an employee of a hypermarket in the city. Meanwhile, he meets and befriends a young woman named Terry at a restaurant he regularly visits at night. One day in front of Robert, she is abducted by Russian mafia men. He later found her in a hospital with injuries sustained as a result of the brutal torturing. He realizes that she has to escape the clutches of the Russian mafia in order to have a good life.
With this, there is no doubt that the revenge against the terrible Russian Mafia for the calm natural Robert will thrill the audience along with the theme and the excellent performance of actor Denzel Washington.
He fought against the injustices before him and came to the aid and shade of the helpless common people. The different presentation, excellent cinematography and heavy BGM bring the film to a high standard.
I am sure The Equalizer will be an unforgettable experience for fans of Denzel Washington's genius."
" Edge of the seat action.
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,9,"I am a big fan of the ""Equalizer"" television series. When they brought Robert McCall to the big screen I was intrigued. Once again Denzel Washington shows his talent to create a totally different spin to a character. While more physical than the Edward Woodward character he makes the character his own.Leaving the company McCall is living the quiet life working in a home improvement store. He is helping a young man fulfill his dream of becoming a store security guard by working with him and making sure he meets the requirements. While at his favorite diner he meets a young girl who goes by the name of ""Teri"". It doesn't take a genius to figure out her profession. Alina wants to break free of her lifestyle but her pimp would rather make an example of her when she assaults her customer. Learning she is in the hospital McCall decides to take things into his own hands by confronting the pimp and his crew. He offers money for the girls freedom. Underestimating him the pimp disrespects him and sends him on his way. What surprises me is that he didn't keep the money before throwing McCall out.Before the dust settles the crew is dead and the pimp is dying a slow painful death. Enter Martin Csokas a.k.a. Teddy Vladimir Pushkin's answer to Luca Brasi. The build up to the climatic battle kept me at the edge of my seat. Hope there will be third movie."
" Denzel was perfect for this role
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,8,"They literally couldn't have picked a better actor to play this role, it suits him so well. Marton also played his role so well because he was so creepy. I'm a sucker for a denzel Washington film, I've loved him ever since training day. Amazing action film with a great story, would highly recommend."
" Outstanding actor
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,9,Denzel is a great actor. I thought The Equalizer and The Equalizer 2 were very good
" Good action movie with story.
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,9,"It is a good action movie with strong story. Actions are classic and believable not foolish or unrealistic like in many action movies. Denzel Washington is perfect in his role. His electrifying actions really impressed me. Mostly silent, but sharp and smart mind, proper guidance and ever help behave to anyone, those are characteristic of Denzel's role is inspirable. Only complaint about we do not know his past very well. If director give some glimpse then it would be more better. the fight between smart and dangerous bad men and clever & sharp minded hero is perfectly enjoyable for every action lovers. Almost all characters are perfect in their roles. Must watch."
" Love love love
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,10,I love this movie ! If the made a million sequels I would watch them all!
" Superb
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,10,"Superb film, Denzel carries the character perfectly. If it wasn't for the drawn out final showdown which felt a little too much like a Die Hard movie to fit in with the rest of fhe movie it would be one of my all time favourites"
" Surprisingly good
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,8,"I love Denzel, he is the unsung magic of action movies and in this title he is shockingly good.This is a kind of revenge movie with retired ex special forces (maybe?) guy who does good but gets caught up with gangsters. It's been done several times now, but here they polish the character development a little, and the action scenes are top class.This kind of movie makes me look at something like 'John Wick' and think why does anyone like that trash... this is way classier, and much better filmed.8/10 solid with good acting."
" Weird cringey flick
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,5,"Feels like a bad crime thriller meets worse super hero..
Full of odd cringe moments also poorly cast.
No spoilers some of denz worst work."
" The bridge
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,10,Great lifestyle show with some great hardware/diy tips. Intense soft ball side story
" Run of the mill straight to video trash...
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,3,Denzel is totally wasted here as he sleepwalks through a cliche-ridden script....he's far too good an actor to be making this garbage. Guess he must of needed the cash...!
" Flawless, well-crafted, another great Fuqua and Washington collaboration.
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,"This movie is the perfect combination between action and drama. The action supplements the plot rather than compensating the lack of it which is the case for a lot of action movies. Washington is intimidatingly believable as the nice guy/trained killer, another outstanding performance. The cat and mouse game between him and Marton Csokas maintains a relentless suspense. The scene in the restaurant is an absolute masterclass of acting. The rest of the cast are amazing also. Elegant direction by Fuqua, same level as the John Wick movies. Fantastic movie."
" Not bored once
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,9,"Good movie, good story, cinematography, loads of action the only thing I'd say wrong with it is not much dialogue, otherwise would have given it 10, looked forward to watching The Equalizer 2 and have now watched it."
" Enjoyable if not particularly memorable
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,7,"Based off the old Edward Woodward TV series of the same name, the film follows ex intelligence agent Robert McCall as he decides to help a young girl he meets in a cafe after she is beaten to a pulp by her Russian mob employers. Things spiral from there as he doles out justice to all those he meets who prey on the helpless. This is a pretty good action film, with a great bad guy, satisfying and visceral action scenes, and of course Denzel plays the character well. The plot is servicable, but the dialogue and characterisation could have been better. Overall its a decent watch, but its not a film I think I'll ever feel the need to see again"
" Equaling the Plainfield
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,8,Watched this movie again after a long time! I forgot how good it was. Enjoy Denzel movies. Brilliant watch and he never disappoints. Great acting.
" Very Good
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,7,"Was recommended by a work colleague. Fully enjoyed, would recommend to others. Denzel Washington was really good"
" Great deadly movie 7/10
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,7,"Denzel Washington is the only reason this movie is not failing. In many cases this movie may seem simple and quite boring. Any other action movie could have been made like that, simple story and plot, no surprises nor twists. I've seen many of those kinds of movies before but ""The Equalizer"" is beyond all that. It is intriguing and deadly. Denzel Washington delivers a fantastic performance and has most of the best lines in the movie. The fact that his character suffers from OCD is important cause the audience can identify with his character, see for themselves how he deals with his rivals and threats and how he finds a way to get out of every bad situation. One memorable sequence in the film is the one near the ending, the ""home malt"" sequence where Denzel's character faces his enemies at the store and sets off traps, it is filmed so well that I had to appreciate every shot of that sequence, the water dropping from the sealing on his face. Every moment from that sequence was intriguing and awesome. ""The Equalizer"" is another good movie by Antoine Fuqua and I wish to see more of Denzel's character in the future."
" Quite brilliant
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,10,"This movie is great, an unsuspecting hero to normal people but we know his past and the way he takes everyone out to help everyone he needs to is amazingly brilliant. The story is packed full of depth with a violent edge which is amazing."
" Great film but in bits and pieces.
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,7,"I have watched John Wick and from some sources I got to know The Equalizer is similar to John Wick, so I was pretty excited as I loved John Wick.After watching Equalizer,I had to say it was completely different from John Wick. It wasn't a fast-paced continuous action film like John Wick nor it had much action sequences.It's rather slow-paced, with movie continuosly losing and regaining its grip unlike John Wick. I was more impressed by the character of Denzel Washington.It's not a revenge drama or a detective film its a movie about a man fighting for justice and beyond himself. Whereas John Wick fights for himself.Denzel Washington was charismatic and accurately portrayed his character. As far as action is concerned it was more brutal but had far less sequences than John Wick.If Denzel had given an unimpressive performance I wouldn't even have watched it. As title suggests some scenes were interesting whereas some were quite boring and unintentional.But definately worth a watch!!"
" BEST STORY AND BEST ACTING AND HUGE FAN OF DENZEL WASHINGTON
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,10,"THIS MOVIE'S STORY IS BEST , ACTING IS BEST AND I'M HUGE FAN OF DENZEL WASHINGTON'S SUPERB ACTING 😍😍❤❤⚡⚡👌👌🔥🔥"
" Very good
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,9,"Very good. I like this film.
It show some things with Denzel Washington that I appreciate."
" Could have been great if it hadn't turned silly
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,5,"The film starts so well. Interesting character played by Washington. A quiet man who goes to a coffee shop at 2 am every night to read one of hundred books recommended by his wife before she died and there he meets a young prostitute who he tries to help when she gets beaten up. Then suddenly he turns into Rambo and starts slaughtering all the bad guys in greater Boston. The last twenty minutes are just ridiculous - he tackles and destroys a small army of baddies armed with sub machine guns using the contents of the DIY superstore where he works. He could picked up half a dozen of their weapons but no, he tackles the ruthless leaders, armed to the teeth, with a nail gun and of course wins. It was like watching an adult version of Home Alone. And then, obviously getting leave of absence from the Home Works Depot, he travels to Moscow and kills a mass of Russians. What a waste of a good actor and an initially good plot idea."
" Denzel Washington save the movie
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,6,"The thing that makes this film watchable and cool are Denzel, sure there is a history, a over the top one, but also with feelings."
" Very good film
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,8,A bit unrealistic at times but overall a very nice film
" Cliched But Entertaining
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,7,"Just viewed this movie tonight. Denzel fans should enjoy it. Similar to his role in Man of Fire. It is essentially a good action movie about a 'bad' good guy going after the bad bad guys (Russian mobsters) and the 'good' bad guys (corrupt cops) after an encounter with a young prostitute in a cafe.I loved the original TV series. Edward Woodward was one of my all time favourite British actors from the immensely enjoyable spy series Callan, and the movies Wicker Man, and Breaker Morant. I was hesitant to watch this film, as I thought it was going to be an over the top American take on a classic British show. While it may be over the top, the film doesn't resemble the TV show except for his name.This film is quite gruesome in its action scenes, and the over use of squelchy sound effects when Denzel dishes out his justice is annoying. There are some good performances from other cast members - Marton Csokas is excellent as the softly spoken, cold to the bone marrow Russian sent to 'sort things out'.The fight out near the end of the film is dark (as in not enough light to see what's going on), but you knew when someone got slaughtered, as the loud, squelching sound effects kicked in. The scene with some constructive use of razor wire had me laughing. Denzel manages to quickly rig up a pully type arrangement with razor wire while being pursued by five baddies. Anyone who has ever tried to work with wire knows it is the most uncooperative stuff ever invented, and certainly wouldn't magically uncoil without a big fight.Denzel is one step ahead of everyone in this film, and we get the idea that Denzel may have been a bad guy in his earlier life, but the ending was too quick which spoilt all the previous tension building retribution. And that is all I have to say about that."
" Great!
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,"If you like movies where the good guy kills all the bad guys from the bottom to the top in a mercyless and cruel way, this is yours!"
" Allowing Instagram to Decide What I Watch While in Isolation Day 5:
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,6,Just one in a long line of 'old man get's revenge' movies. Honestly The Equalizer offers slightly more than most films in it's oddly specific genre with a great lead performance from Denzel Washington and a competent director behind the camera (Training Day's Antoine Fuqua).If you tend to like gritty dramas with bursts of graphic violence then this is truly better than most of the competition but if that's not your thing then you probably won't be won over by this.
" One of Denzel's worst performances - soul-less and generic
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,3,"Everything about this movie is generic: the music, the lights, even the fighting, with some pretty corny cinematography to round things off. I generally really like Denzel Washington as an actor, but he gives such a lackluster performance in this one, and I think he has been miscast, or at least been misdirected by a director who does not seem to have a unique vision at all. Denzel's character's back story is something that we have seen time and time again, but it comes off as unbelievable here. On top of that, the story is so badly structured, with some characters that play a big role early on seemingly forgotten for the rest of the film. Altogether a huge disappointment."
" Denzell is one of the best actors in Hollywood
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,7,"The movie was amazing and will probably stay as one of my fav action movies ever and to make matters even better Denzel Washington is the movie and his performance in the movie was impecable and so was the main antigonist performance.The action was well layed out and sought through, although there are some scene kinda get me boring but the story and emotion put into this movie is just great and the music in this movie are amazing I even downloaded some of them on my phone so I could remember how it feels to be a badass like DenzelAnd the final fight of the movie where Denzel faces off against Marton and his gang in the super market was if not my fav scene of all time and the way Denzel finishes off Marton was just SOO BADASS and SICK, when I heard they were making a sequel I was the happiest man alive and when I watched it I had the same amazing feeling as when I watched the first one. My honest opinion would be something like 6.5 or 7/10 but I just love this movie SOO much I have to give it a 7"
" Sad and unrealistic
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,7,"The chick is hot, leggy, super slim and has long feminine hair. Then they damage their own goods? They destroy their own money maker? That makes no sense. Then the girl gets a boyish short hair cut. How is that for a downer?"
" Good vigilante thriller
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,7,"This was a rather nice surprise and one of the better action movies I've seen from past decade. It has a good balance of slower drama parts and rough action senes. But it all ties together, and the tension keeps building all the time. Denzel Washington is great as the lead guy. He's tough and cool but also has a subtle emotional quality behind his serious face. The supporting characters are also ok though they don't have very much to do. There's just enough something to make you care about the characters.Now comes the (minor)spoiler section:The main character's past is not explained very much which bothered me a bit. But in the end I also felt that it was a nice mystery to be left open. But the problem is that the movie starts in a rather serious and realistic way but then it's revealed that this ordinary guy has some secret super commando skills. Why is it that every time in movies when a main character runs into a criminal gang he just happens to be some war veteran, former cop or agent or something. Well, maybe that's because we're in an action movie. I just felt like the humble personality of the character didn't completely fit together with his overpowered combat skills.Overall it's a good movie. Recommended for anyone who likes thrillers about a renegade guy seeking justice against a whole bunch of bad guys."

Denzel Washington is some ex-CIA/super-soldier/superhuman/whatever that helps out good people and kills bad guys. Straightforward, right?Action scenes were damn enjoyable and the ending was epic. Who else could kill with a nailgun and look so badass?I was debating on giving this film a 3/5, but I've rewatched it so many times that I think it deserves an extra star.4/5."

" One of My favorite movie ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,10,"Strengths: The combination of Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington (Robert McCall) is one that always works. They bring out the best in each other. While this isn't one of Denzel's greatest acting jobs, he does way more with the role than you'd expect. The movie does a good job of showcasing how nice of a guy McCall is, which makes his violent outbursts way more interesting. The action scenes are well handled. I loved the way McCall would see things in slow motion before acting them out. They hold nothing back in terms of violence, making sure each scene looks as brutal as it needs to be. And thanks to the tension built up by Fuqua"
" Denzel at his (usual) best.
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,7,There was a time when Al Pacino was my most favorite actor-no more-Denzel Washington is probably the only actor that can make a lousy movie into a classic. I have yet to see a movie starring DW where he doesn't turn even the creepiest movie into something worth watching. I don't think ANYONE can compare with his abilities in the acting field-thus he is my new favorite and one of the two or three who can make any movie worth watching. It's really not fair to his fellow actors how he takes over the screen with his ability and makes everyone else seem like a hack!
" DENZEL WASHINGTON IS FANTASTIC, PROBABLY MY FAVE DENZEL FILM.
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,8,"I loved ""The Equaliser"" & i loved the legendary Denzel in his role as the extremely skilled & dangerous ""Robert McCall"" an ex-CIA Agent turned Urban Vigilante. Denzel is one of the greatest actors in cinema history FACT & i grew up watching & loving this guy & over the years he's cranked out some Amazing films such as ""Training Day"" & ""Man on Fire"" & ""Deja Vu"" & ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" & ""The Bone Collector"" & many, many more films. I'm a fan of Denzel but some of his flicks i didn't like such as ""Inside Man"" & ""The Book of Eli"" (terrible ending) & ""2 Guns"" but most of his work is usually excellent with excellent performances.
Here Denzel gives another incredible performance to his big list of great roles!!! McCall is a deadly man but a good man who will stop & help someone in trouble & here set in Boston he gets in deep trouble with the local scum, the Violent Russian gangsters who pimp out young girls & here ""McCall"" helps out a young brutalized girl ""Teri"" played greatly by Cloe Grace Moretz & comes head to head with a very dangerous man called ""Teddy"" played intensely by Martin Csokas, we also have a small role for the excellent Bill Pullman who turns up later in the film.
Director Antoine Fuqua has created a fantastic urban vigilante action Thriller that's exciting, gritty, brutal & fun.
The fact Robert McCall works a regular ordinary job in a hardware store is just genius & grounds everything is a sense of realism.
McCall goes about his violent business cleaning up a dark crime ridden Boston & meets good people as well as bad people.
Some of my favourite moments are just of McCall sitting in the all night diner reading his book & drinking his tea, little scenes like that are just beautiful with the night time setting & the look of the city streets at night are all captured beautifully.The Action is brutally fun when McCall starts using his ""Special Skills"" on the local thugs & corrupted cops, it's a joy to watch him doing what we would all love to be done in real life!!!
Another excellent Denzel Washington film & role, this is probably my favourite Denzel film & role!!!"
" The black death
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,8,"Denzel Washington made this film. His portrayal of his character is great and you can feel the lack of emotion in his face.This film is a straight up karma Action film.It hits all the places needed for a good action film, crazy killings and a bad-ass hero.Must watch film for any fan of revenge action movies."
" Overly unrealistic, just like ""John Wick"".
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,6,"As I said, the story is too unrealistic for me.
A man against the entire Russian mafia.
And he got away with only two small wounds.
This can only be a fantasy film. The plot was action-packed.
Sometimes it was exciting, but why do you need a simple
man as superhuman. I would like to see more reference to reality."
" Bloody good!
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,10,So much violence done to the right people. Loved seeing villains getting put down like dogs
" Watch out for Denzel Washington
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,6,"The Equalizer stars Denzel Washington and is directed by Antoine Fuqua who directed Training Day, which also starred Denzel Washington. Denzel Washington plays a hitman who wants to lead a normal life, but after an innocent girl played by Chloe Grace Moretz ends up in the hospital by some Russian gangsters he decides to take matters in his own hands. We don't really know what Denzel did before he decided to live a normal life but from what I saw it looked like he was a hitman and I like how he portrayed the different personalities to this person. The movie was a little too long for my taste, because it focused on his vigilante personality while at the same time dealing with the Russian gangsters. But what I really enjoyed was how he goes to an ordinary innocent man to an assassin when people mess with the things he loves the most. He's not necessary lonely he likes helping people and he tries his best to leave his past behind and the concept of having someone go from innocent to hitman is very well acted by Denzel. But this is where the movie has its faults. For one thing Chloe Grace Moretz doesn't have a lot of screen time and I felt that they could've done so much more with this character so we could understand the pain and suffering she went through. The main antagonist is the other problem. He tries so hard to be scary and intimidating that it almost comes off as laughable because we've seen this happen in so many movies that he doesn't really give us anything to work with. This movie is more of a spy movie than a revenge movie as it is mostly a cat and mouse and also feels like a Hitman video game than anything else. So overall, I'm not saying that it's a bad movie, it was average with a protagonist that was likeable, but there were some pieces that didn't fit together and that's where it went wrong."
" Virtue, valor, strength and Denzel to bring it all together
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,8,"It is going to be good even before I see it. Denzel picks roles that work for him; the budget is there to support it; and the film maker is good at what he does. It's a formula and it works to produce movies that I enjoy ... a lot. In recent years there have been similar hero / anti-hero movies coming out with big name stars playing them. I remember a lot of them being similarly good. After I watched the Equalizer, I thought to myself that I knew it was going to be good."
" Like This Film
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,8,"I normally dislike reboots. I always laugh at people with no new ideas, but this one was good.
The acting is solid, the violence and action is believable and extreme and they even have super thin flaunting chicks (though the ho gets a boyish hair cut sadly). So there is a lot to like.
Watch it."
" Copied the British TV series that starred Edward Woodward as the Equalizer.

" Rescued by Denzel
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,7,"This is a pretty standard by the numbers action movie which is saved from total mediocrity by the usual brilliant performance Denzel Washington. A film that would otherwise quickly fade from the memory if it wasn't for the stylishly filmed moments of morally questionable, ultra violence punctuated throughout its length. The final showdown is certainly one of the more gruesome and imaginative endings I have see in a while."

" misogynistic and boring
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,2,"This film was made by men for men, and it has really gotten tiring. A man (good guy) going on revenge spree against Russian mafia pimps. He is trying to save a girl prostitute , and you only see like three women characters throughout the film for a few minutes, mostly victims and prostitutes. Everything else is male violence trying to show who got the bigger balls. Boring and expected. Please Hollywood stop making such boringass films."
" Nothing unexpected

" DENZEL DELIVERS
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,7,"Proof that some actors can be perfectly cast and bring an average production into a good workable one.The story is typical, the plot twists predictable and the action a little bit too optimistic.But all that doesn't matter when you have the universal trope of justice delivered with superb bare faced acting of a character brought to life as Denzel does."
" Awesome
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,10,"Of all the action movies ive seen throughout the years, i must apologize to Mr, Washington for waiting five years to see this one. Don't uou wait and check out this out."
" How many times have we seen this movie?
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,3,"Loner guy befriends the young girl in trouble and has to rescue her from her pimp. Been done a million times before. True Romance, Drive, the Professional, Taxi Driver, but really just a total rip off from the 1980 film the Exterminator.It was too slow and predictable. Unfortunately these type of movies have just been done to death. Like the Taken series, John Wick, the one man with a deadly past goes on a revenge justice murder spree.Everything is just so cliche from the Russian Gangsters to the lone expert killer and the vulnerable abused prostitute. In addition rip off dialogue from the Godfather, Pulp Fiction.So sure it is a waste of time evening fun film, but don't look for originality."
" The Old Timer Who Masters Time...
",2019-10-29 00:00:00,7,"""What I do have are a very particular set of skills, skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.""The infamous monologue taken from the movie of the same name set a new milestone in action pictures, reinventing the vigilante figure with the additional ""special sets of kills"" and replacing the 'crusade against violence' by a less high-scaled and more personal-oriented fight, like saving young and vulnerable girls from the claws of male predators and abusing pimps. It's quite a bold move in an era where 'damsels in distresses' and urban violence have stopped to be popular tropes, but I guess this is why it took the talent of versatile and quality actors such as Liam Neeson or Denzel Washington to elevate the film about the level of pure macho-power exaltation.Audiences would accept these men as role models rather than regular action movies stars maybe because they bring a dimension of humanity and fatherly warmth. Not that it lacked in Arnie, Sly or Bruce Willis but I'm talking about 2010s standards where it's not too cool to sound cool anymore. As Robert McCall, Washington doesn't replay Bryan Mills but gives his own depth in a role that could have been rather two-dimensional, that he made it to finance his ""Fences"" or make a departure from his award-baity performances doesn't matter, he's quite the man in a performance that isn't too showy even in the showiest parts. And you've got to credit the patience Antoine Fuqua demonstrates in the exposition.McCall is the bookworm, getting through the Top 100 must-read Books, he works in a home depot shop, gets along with his colleagues, coaches one of them to lose weight to pass a security job test and befriends a young prostitute played by Chloe Grace Moretz. It all builds up to the crucial moment where he makes his 'Mills' offer to Russian hoodlums who showed that women's welfare wasn't their priority. They're all drowning in vodka and cocky arrogance, with every inch of their bodies harboring intimidating skulls and tattoos but naturally, no one takes ""Dedushka"" seriously... so the old-timer has no other choice than teaching them a lesson or two about time efficiency. It takes twenty seconds of a nasty fight to make his point but since he aimed for sixteen, we get the idea that he's slipping. Still, it's the establishing moment we've all waited for.The act isn't without consequences and brought the attention to a Russian Mafia ""Don"" named Vladimir Pushkin (quite the name) who sends his best dragon ""Teddy"" (Marton Csokas) to hunt the killer. This is a standard action picture about a man singlehandedly defeating the almighty Russian mafia and while the film does find ingenuous ways to avoid the obvious comparisons with ""Taken"", it's the charismatic presence of Denzel Washington that makes the difference. And it's not a detail, when you have a title that doesn't say much about the film but sound cool enough to make you curious, you've got to have a ""name"" to press the play button.It seems crazy said like this but choosing the right movie to pick on Netflix is such a patience-demanding ordeal that all it takes is a title and a charismatic actor. Say what you want about Denzel Washington, his movies aren't all on the same caliber than ""Malcolm X"" but he always delivers a memorable performance even in a role that doesn't aim for award and where cinematic excellence consists on dodging caricature and being believable as a skilled fighter. And that's the power a few actors can pretend to have, something that makes Washington equal to Clint Eastwood, his ""presence"" is more vital than his ""words"". But even Eastwood couldn't do without worthy antagonist and Washington's presence is enhanced by a solid villain.And maybe that's the aspect that gives the film a slight edge over ""Taken"", which is that the villain always possesses a special set of skills and doesn't let himself intimidated as well. And so we follow a cat-and-mouse chase where the roles are alternatingly reversed and where the chasers become the chased ones and we don't know if the film is as good as the hero or the villain So the film follows a long storyline where we see a lot of fighting, some remarkably gruesome that reminded me of ""A History of Violence"", but even violence can get routinely and the most memorable parts turn out to be the quieter ones, which all takes us to a dinner conversation and the closest to a great confrontation the film ever got.When McCall confronts ""Teddy"" to his own past in Soviet Union, the writing is brilliant, in fact it's so good that the fact that the film chose the safe way and end with a climactic confrontation set in McCall's job area, his own comfort zone, left me disappointed. It seems that Fuqua wasn't so confident about his material that he thought he had to keep on the track and makes the violence an escalating process... but think of a film like ""First Blood"", once we know that Rambo is a man not to mess with, the film surprises us with the heartbreaking Vietnam monologue, revealing a hidden depth in Rambo's personality, I wish ""Equalizer"" could find a way to take us off-guard.It's a sign of lack of maturity when a film doesn't try to surprise you, even a film like ""Taken"" chose to have a shocking moment where Mills' mission proved not to be a complete success, but in ""Equalizer"" even when McCall's friends and colleagues are taken as hostages, it's hard to believe that none of them was killed just to make a point. So, either the bad guys underestimate McCall to the end, or act dumber than they should or get too soft it's almost off-character. I guess it makes the fiim as good as the hero... after all."
" Truly Amazing
",2019-10-21 00:00:00,8,"Denzel's acting in this movie reminds you once again what a great actor he is; the slow pace of the events unravel a mysterious cold character, only later on to melt your heart with his human actions!"
" Not Denzel's Best movie ever but it was okay.
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,7,"Movie starts off in the life of Denzel's character Mr. McCall. At first the audience will see him as a single older black dude who works at home depot or in the movie its called ""home mart"" anyhow he apparently helps out some heavyset co worker get his security license and is also providing knowledge and wisdom to his two youth co workers also. He appears friendly and polite to all his female coworkers as well. The plot delves a little deeper as we learn his character can't sleep and has insomnia and spends most his nights at a 24/7 diner drinking tea and reading books. it is there where he befriends a young Russian prostitute and she gives him a CD of her singing and befriends him back. Later something happens to the girl without too much spoilers she is a prostitute for the Russian mob. He goes after them out of revenge for hurting her.The plot: it was very bland and mild. It sort of is intriguing but most of it you will say to yourself eh, its been done before.Action sequences: again nothing special here, the ending part to the movie is very cool and Antone Fuqua uses his typical cinematography with water dripping every where.The sound track has a song by Moby that we all know and a song by Eminem at the ending credits.Keep in mind this movie came out in 2014 and most of you have seen it already. My basic review is this: its an okay feel good movie but doesn't do Denzels great acting abilities any justice. Like I said the plot is very bland as we later find out in the movie that he was an ex-CIA assassin and left his wife due to the agency. its never really explained why he goes after the Russians considering they didn't kill the girl. Nor does it go into detail about his connection to the CIAThe antagonist who is the ruthless Russian Mafias lieutenant is assigned to find and track down and kill Mr McCall for a bigger Russian boss located in Moscow called ""Pushkin"" played by an actor I like named Marton Csokas.The Russians are in bed with some corrupt cops as well who work in Boston and one is played by David Harbour (Hell-boy). Denzels character tracks him down and is able to use him to flush out the remaining mobsters.The fat guy is played by Johnny Skourtis an unknown actor who does a pretty good job of being Denzels side kick as he always seems to have one in all his movies. Denzels character is trying to help him lose weight to become a security guard for the Home Depot company they work at and Denzel is constantly finding him trying to smuggle potato chips in his healthy tuna sandwiches.The girl is played by Chloe Grace Moretz another unknown at least by me, who actually survives but unfortunately her friend isn't so lucky who falls victim to Marton the antagonist character.All in all like I said its an okay movie. reason being is Denzel Washington you expect the movie to be great and when it isn't it is somewhat of a disappointment however like I said the movie doesn't disappoint but isn't great either just flat out okay."
" A Denzel Washington flick
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,8,"The Equalizer is an action thriller movie Starring Denzel Washington, Marton Csokas, Chloë Grace Mortez, David Harbour and Johnny Skourtis and is directed by Antoine Fuqua.The movie is based on the 1980 TV series on the same name.The movie might not be that profound but it is a very well planned action thriller. The killing by guns, knives, corkscrew, barbed wire and drill is not only brutal but also shows the true character.The character of Washington is appealing in the form of ruthless fighters so as of Csokas who is equally ruthless and smart. The fighting scenes is amazing. Background music is also good.The only little flaw in the movie is it's slow climax.Overall a convincing action movie and if you are an action lover this is a movie for you."
" Good entertainment but tooooo long
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,8,"2 hours is really a stretch for a movie with such a simple plot. It's a good story, but the first part drags way too long. Good action and terrific acting from both Denzel Washington and Chloe Grace Moretz. Good directing from Antoine Fuqua as well. It is a good action movie, but this one isn't really mesmerizing. In a few years, I will remember John Wick movies way better. That's what happens when you have a good film but almost no originality whatsoever. I enjoyed it, but I also feel a great potential that could have been better exploited."
" Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua make magic again!
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,8,"This dang thing is near perfect. It introduces you to Robert McCall, the man and his inner character before it unleashes it's hammer. Once the action starts though it's relentless and taut. Denzel Washington inhabits both sides of the character completely and seamlessly. Martin Csokas is sadistically at home as the tattooed Russian psychopath Nicolai Itchenko. Director Antoine Fuqua of Training Day fame once again delivers a winner for Denzel."
" Well written and produced

",2019-06-17 00:00:00,7,"This movie has a generic plot, damsel in distress, the bad guys, the overpowered superhero that can kill anyone in the most stylish and ridiculous ways... but it's entertaining, like if you don't think about the plot too much and you just want to enjoy the good guy punish the bad guys and bring a small piece of justice to the world.Cool slow-motion scenes, cool fight scenes (ridículous, but cool), and Denzel is great at this role. Fun ride."
" Perfectly Average
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,5,"This movie came and went quietly from my personal perspective but for a certain demographic this movie was a smash. I work at a video store and I can't count the number of times people ask for it, are frustrated we are out of it, or ask if the new one (which is just now releasing in theaters) is out on DVD yet.Now that the new on is dropping, I thought I would see what the fuss is about. After all, just because it had flown under MY radar didn't mean it was bad.I would love to say that this movie was outstanding but it wasn't. I'd love to rant about how terrible it was, but it wasn't. It was just a solidly made movie that doesn't do anything really outstanding.It's the sort of movie that fills video shelves, that gets made because we demand more entertainment and no one can keep up. I don't really understand why people were so gaga for it.Even if you like any part of this movie, there are other movies that do that thing better. If you like the fight scenes, ""John Wick"" is better. If you like the saving of the girl in it, ""You Were Never Really Here"" or ""Taken"" does that better. If you like the Russian mob stuff, ""Eastern Promises"" is better. If you like Antoine Fuqua or Denzel Washington, ""Training Day"" is better.Literally, the only reasons I can think of to see this movie are if you are a Denzel Washington completionist or if you'll just see anything he's in.I know I'm going to end up seeing the sequel (probably because I'll need to review it) but I don't really know why. There is nothing in this film that demands one, thought it left room open for one. I suppose every aging actor has to try and Liam Neeson it these days, but I don't expect it to be any better than ""Taken 2."""

He also acts as a Life Coach to those around him particularly an overweight co-worker Ralphie (Johnny Skourtis) who wants to be a security guard and Teri, a Russian immigrant prostitute (Chloë Grace Moretz) who he bumps into at a restaurant.Bob gives out advice like ""You got to be who you are"" and ""Doubt Kills."" His advice to the prostitute that she could be anything she wanted, didn't work out when she thought she could be a boxer with her Russian pimp. Sometimes people need more than a life coach, they need a vigilante who happens to be one of the Pips.Armed with a trained eye, honey, clover, and a cork screw, Bob takes on the entire Russian mafia which contains nothing but heavily armed stereotypical sociopaths with satanic tattoos.There must be nearly a 100 new vigilante films out there right now. I know, I reviewed most of them. If I was going to watch one, this one would be it.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" May the Blood Flow
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,8,"Denzel Washington is just great and The Equalizer belongs like the John Wick (Keanu Reeves) and Taken (Liam Neeson) movies to the new masterclass of revenge/vigilante movies. The Equalizer is a true to the heart successor of our former (or still) heroes of long gone times like Mr. Eastwood and Mr. Bronson: the king is dead, long live the king, so to say.The Equalizer is great stuff - if you like your action spiced up with a good shot of violence."
" The quiet ones are the worst!
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,8,"Denzel Washington's, often slow delivery to his performances, suits this character perfectly. The quiet, nice guy, who's lifestyle is obsessively mundane and runs like clockwork, has a score to settle, with anyone who does wrong.Impressive action from Washington, a great build up, in general a real crowd pleaser"
" DOESNT GET A TEN COS ITS NOT MAN ON FIRE
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,9,"Just reviewed EQ2 so thought it was time to revisit EQ1. This is an outstanding trip out by Denzel, Marton, Chloe and Melissa with more than adequate support from the filler bad guys. Loved the side bars to keep the equalization trundling along. This film in my opinion, is so good I even watch on commercial full channels (along with MonF) which is not normally true unless a film beats my fairly high bar for excellence.. This one beats the bar by some height. The scene between Teddy and Robert in the restaurant was truly epic in its perfection so Kudos to Denxel and Marton for nailing it. Only minor niggles were the small plot holes and Roberts use of anything but a firearm for maximum death causing. Lets be honest, given his former trade I am sure he is more than proficient in stuff that goes bang at the pointy end. Having said that, maybe it added to the overall deadliness of our main man and perhaps JWs pencils could be added to the mix lol. In summary far better than EQ2 but hopefully equal to or even subservient to a prayed for EQ3. As usual, well played Mr Fuqua you excel in this Genre plus a good score that matched the films pace and ambience"
" Denziel brilliance
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,8,This film is just another of denziels quality film list he is brilliant and the film is actioned packed and brilliant must watch
" Stylish and surprisingly good action film
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,7,"Hollywood don't tend to make action films like this anymore and it's an odd choice. This film might have a basic core storyline with some government spook thrown in for good measure, but it gets it right. The film is grim and gritty, but it is nice to see a revenge film dialled up. It is not John Wick tempo, but it is never boring, Washington adds much needed weight in the lead."
" Amazing
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,10,A movie that portrays the difference between good and bad
" Crescendo
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,6,"First act: the plot has potential, it's a bit slow, but let's see how it develops.
Second act: the villain is interesting, but Denzel is some kind of supernatural force, I don't buy that. I think this is the umpteenth silly action movie.
Third act: ok, I get your point. The hyperbole is so clear and so fun now, that I like it. I like the character, who fully shows himself for what he is. I like the ""funny"" killings, and the bold lines.This movie is a linear crescendo, and I think you'll get rewarded if you have patience.
My rating is some kind of average between the three acts."
" Needs more equalizing
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,6,Denzel carries this movie on his shoulders. Nothing else was good except when he uses his watch and does his thing. Needed more of it and never got satisfaction.
" Great Performance By Denzel Washington.
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,7,You can notice several things in this scene when McCall start analyzing the area first thing he notices is that the thug thumbs back the hammer he also notices the thugs eyes are unwavering and are at a fixed point that shows that the thug wasn't bluffing and he had the intention of killing the woman for the ring he also notices the tattoos on the thugs hand and neck indicating that he's a part or was a part of the Aryan Brotherhood and is likely done prison time increasing the chances that he wouldn't hesitate to kill the woman after that McCall is weighing his options he could kill the man in seconds and be done with it but there was the risk of the woman being killed in the struggle and as soon as the child walked in he realized that there was even a higher risk of not only the woman getting killed but also more innocent bystanders he figured the best bet was to let the man get away with the money in the ring and then deal with him later I love the way those scenes are shot no words need to be spoken it's all done visually
" Effective and dynamic
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,8,"In the inventory of almost normal heroes like Jason Bourne, Jack Reacher, Frank Castle, Bryan Mills, John Wick, ... here is a brand new one: Robert McCall a.k.a. The Equalizer. He gives a chance to the unlucky ones against the villains, by 'equaliz'-ing the forces. In this first opus, he meets by chance a prostitute as young as lost and ... hop! hop !! hop !!! ... he annihilates the Russian underworld of Boston. Wooooow!. Sounds easy!! The result is rather successful. I loved it."
" Are there Police Advisors to make the movie realistic?
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,5,"In the scene when Detective Masters (David Harbour), hears the alarm sounding on his car, he walks out the door to his bedroom and checks his revolver for bullets.
This is where an advisor is needed: all of the bullets have dimples in the primers, indicating that they have all been fired, so he is actually taking a useless handgun, unless he throws it for protection."
" Too slow or Too less action?
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,6,"The beginning of this movie is too slow.
The story was not as I expected. But It seems to me that this movie could have been finished early.
And I guess this is a action movie, and McCall is a very strong and skillfull man as we can see in the movie, but he kills the Main villain of the movie without showing any skill. As we see, The villain called ""Teddy"" is also a good skillfull fighter. Then, at the end of the movie why there was no hand to hand fighting scene?Although , I liked the last part where the lady came back and talk to McCall.My opinion is that, this movie could have been better."
" Super Disturbing
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,3,"I saw this film two years ago. My stepfather insisted we watch it. I was dubious from the start, considering it's not my sort of thing, and could see it was rated 18. Cue about 30/45 minutes in and an incredibly graphic and disturbing violent scene which I tried hard not to focus on (I discreetly took my glasses off). There was another one near the end too. Is also full of swearing. My stepfather was laughing. Really? Most load of violent rubbish I've ever seen. He's on about watching the sequel now, there's a film I'll be giving a miss, especially after reading about the violence in that too. I dare say there are others who liked it though. The reason I've rated this more than 1, is the fact that I do know Denzel Washington is a good actor."
" A kinda mediocre film.
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,7,"It's a strange set up for an action thriller. I love the ideas and ""cat and mouse chasing"", but honestly it has really bad trouble with its messages and direction. It felt really bland half the time and it really brought down my interest. The characters are passable along with some other elements. Some great fights scenes are shown and other ways of killing people are also seen. The way he works up through the gangsters system and taking them down is very awesome to see. However, this movie is kinda mediocre to the point where it's only passable overall. Yes it has good things but a lot of other things aren't execute well. 7/10."
" 5 killings in 16 sec.
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,2,"Denzel Washington calculates in his mind how much time he needs in order to finish 5 gangsters in a room. He says ""16 seconds"" but he fails for 6 seconds. This is most probably a shame.Professionals like Denzel should be hired in the U.S. special forces. Their men are too slow, weak and inefficient. If Denzel managed to finish the whole business of some Mr. Pushkin in the East Coast alone, one wonders what the hell their men do for living."
" Another Mess by Antoine Fuqua
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,3,"First of all I made the mistake of seeing The Equalizer 2 before this film. #2 was terribly misdirected and virtually impossible to understand. Now that I've seen #1 I understand a bit more about #2 BUT sequels should be able to stand on their own and Fuqua totally failed on that point.Of course Denzel's performance is excellent as always but in general this, and #2, are simply not worth your time to watch. I cannot understand how Antoine Fuqua gets directing gigs."
" A remarkable action masterpiece!
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,10,"This felt like a complete movie. A complete action movie that was fully developed in terms of plot, characters, action and almost everything it had to offer.The Equalizer is a remarkable action masterpiece!Denzel Washington isn't just a great actor, he's also one of the top action stars of Hollywood. As a killing machine who is equally disciplined and caring, his performance is a sight to behold. Every other cast member has given possibly their best.The film develops its characters, sets up the conflict and gets the action sequences staged at the right time and in right amount. Every fight has something special to offer. I can assure you that you'd definitely want to see the action scenes again if you happen to like the film.Antoine Fuqua is one of the best action filmmakers out there, and this 2014 action thriller bears witness to that."
" The story is general
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,7,"The story is general, but the scenes and editions of the film are good. Especially at the end, the water droplets are matched with the protagonist's indifferent face."

Reviewers who find fault with this movie define themselves, not this great, entertaining movie. Loved it!!! Bon Appetit"
" Great flair
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,10,"I avoided this movie for years because it was very obviously just another big star big action movie. It's better than that. It reminds me of Bourne movies, highly professional and really, really enjoyable. The filming is super, wherever this movie goes, streets, bars, stores, one gets a real sense of rich urban texture. For no other reason this is a great look at Boston. The director has a talent for lighting and sympathetic closeups, as well as a sort of earthy pathos. It's a good length, its a good pace. How the baddie got his accent is pure talent. Denzil is as cool as Man On Fire. This movie is a guaranteed antidote."
" A good man removes bad people
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,8,"I liked this movie. It feels right. It does not feel meaningless, because it teaches us something about how we can chose to live. It speaks about how we can show kindness and be helpful to people we meet and people we know and people we hardly don't know. It also gives us hope that bad people will not win. That being good is worthwhile."
" Film review
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,10,I really like this movie Denzel did very well acting in this movie he is a star actor and the scene with him inside the room taking out 5 guys is amazing he did a great job with the movie
" Good story and just for Densel's performance the movie gets the best ratings
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,8,"This whole movie is all about Densel's performance on each frame. Story is definitely great, I wished the villain had more story of the past rather than narrated. Could have helped for the Part 2. Overall fun movie"
" A More Deliberate Jason Bourne
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,8,"13 May 2017. Teddy, the cold and sinister character, in The Equalizer played by Marton Csokas had a similar role as a polished and sophisticated professional in The Bourne Supremacy (2004) facing Matt Damon's famous elite and dangerous Bourne character. The Equalizer has similar elements of the Bourne series with its carefully choreographed physical scenes and relational interactions. Yet Denzel Washington is offered secretive role playing an even more common place character who only become even more creative in his use of every day instruments.The is slow to build and the Denzel's character is allowed time to develop along with the simply, normal everyday series of regular business day job activities and a somewhat obsessive-compulsive night light routine of staying up late and reading books at an all night café. In the Asian movie fashion, Denzel's character is faced with a moral dilemma of becoming who he was and placing himself in danger and watching the innocent be abused and maimed for their desire to be what they want.By movie's end, there is a surge of violence in intense but singular doses unlike the continuing big explosions and multiple slaughter on screen. Instead there is a deliberate and calculated almost methodical approach to a sort of moral physical justice that offers up one origination story for the original 1985 television series. The focus of this movie is not so much on the spectacular special effects but a more cool sophisticated use of lethal behavior similar to Liam Neeson's earlier Taken (2008)."
" A high quality action movie
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,8,"I'm not sure why it took me so long to watch this - perhaps the hype surrounding it put me off, or maybe my dislike of remakes - but I was pleasantly surprised to find The Equalizer to be a well written, well directed and superbly acted action movie.
The pacing is excellent - a little slower than most of the genre, and with a measure of subtlety not usually found within it. Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying this is The Godfather or A Matter of Life and Death, but it's a damned fine action flick. As Luc Besson found with Taken, get a solid script and put a superb actor in the lead, and you can raise the bar on the standard gun-toting fare.
As you might expect, the movie is violent, often gory, and some of the action a touch on the heroic side, but it's well enough done that it is believable and never for a moment takes the viewer out of the film.
Highly recommended."
" Very entertaining action thriller
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,7,"I did not expect to like it that much. If you're into John Wick and Taken, this is definitely for you. Maybe not the most original and a few too many cheesy slo-mo shots but still a well executed action thriller Movie."
" Mükemmel

" Too long, man
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,5,"So I watched this movie, 'couse becouse of christmas I have some free time and I just wanted to watch good, simple action movie to relax.My problem with The Equalizer is the fact that it's over two hours long and that's way too much, becouse the plot is very simple. Hour and a half would be just fine but it feels just way to long.Action scenes are fine. They're not nearly as good as fight scenes in John Wick, but they're fine. My problem is that they were too dark and it wasn't always clear what's happening.I really liked the actors. - Denzel Washington was good, but Chloe Moretz stole every scene she was in. She was as great as usually.
The other thing that was missing for me was some humor, but it's not a big flow.Overall it's okey. If you haven't seen John Wick, or new Mission Impossible movies, or A Man From U. N. C. L. E. I recomend any of those over The Equalizer but if you have and you like action movies. - It'll do alright."
" Too long not like the tv show
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,2,I more or less enjoyed the movie as an action movie but it was a bit too long and nothing like the tv show. I was hoping more for something similar to the tv show.
" Incredible action movie with a focus on characters
",2018-12-19 00:00:00,9,"The Equalizer is an incredible action movie with a focus on characters. Denzel Washington gives an incredible performance with a great supporting performance from Chloë Grace Moretz. Antoine Fuqua's direction is also incredible with some amazing fight scenes. It's only downside is a one dimensional villain, who is quite forgettable but good enough in the fight scenes."

" Everything John Wick wanted to be.
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,8,"Guess which movie I'm describing:
A retired hitman/ agent is pulled back into butt-kicking mode because the Russian mafia messed with something he cared about.John Wick? The Equalizer?Answer: Yes.The difference is The Equalizer really just towers over Wick as a film.
Full disclosure: I appreciaed the cinematography of Wick and saw what it was going for but felt the whole film was flat and gimmicky more than the cool and flashy film it was going for.
Not all would agree with me.Where The Equalizer beats John Wick is that Equalizer weaves a story and plotline that is actually engaging, featuring characters that you care about.
There's the human element to The Equalizer that Wick just missed.
Denzel Washington is about the best at his craft and he shines at translating human emotions through his character onto the screen. Further, there was a redeeming aspect to the story with a guiding ""noble cause"" that excused this film from being just another action-thrilller filled with ""senseless violence.""
The action sequences, while not as flashy as Wick, were delivered with more meaning.
Wick suffered from losing impact through running a continuous loop of action sequences that all started to blend together.
The Equalizer took care to mind the pacing and rhythm of the story, interweaving action and downtime for plot and character development.The story telling was direct enough to not be confusing, but left enough up to the imagination to avoid being boring. For example, it was never spelled-out what Washington's character did for a living prior to working at the hardware store.There were some interesting McGuyver-esque ""being resourceful with your environment"" elements to the action that was refreshing in comparison to the heaps of cliche action films where gunplay/ Martial arts are the only vehicles for kills.The cinematography was flawless and ventured into some creative shots and techniques. The big climactic ending entailed some dazzling filming involving some artful use of lighting and rain. That film-work alone is worth the watch.The main antagonist did seem to be going for a very Kevin Spacey vibe in looks and persona. The casting almost was a doppleganger for Spacey. I have to wonder if they missed an attempt at getting Spacey for the role. I felt on that front, it felt that character a bit forced
and cliche.My apologies if this review came off as more a comparison, but the two films are just so similar on the surface and (in my opinion) The Equalizer was a superior film in almost every way.8.5/10"
" November review
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,8,"This movie is great, this action movie has great action scenes and the plot line is amazing with how overtime the main character develops and the action increases over time with times of suspense."
" One of the best action movies ever made. Period.
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,9,"I love smart movie-making, where the film doesn't spoon feed you everything, and instead respects its audience/viewers to fill in the missing blanks (another great example is Mad Max Fury Road). This movie starts slow with an intentionally boring life of an ordinary man, then ramps it up to true badassery when the time comes; the optimal use of theme music, and external tracks makes me get goosebumps every single time. Oh, and I've only seen 2 guys who can ""act"" incredibly without ""acting""/ with a poker face - one is Bill Murray, the other one is Denzel Washington.
PS: I love John Wick, but this movie outperforms it in every way possible, except for maybe Keanu Reaves."
" Bad!!! ASSS MOVIE as in Stellar!!!
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,10,Denzel just got that bad m^#*@; style film. The story needs to move forward for the next film!!!
" Not bad
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,6,"This isn't a bad movie. It's not a 7, but not a 6 like I rated it. Somewhere in the middle. Why? Ahhhhhhhh it's a modern version of The Book Of Eli. I guess if you have seen John Wick you have seen this movie. Good movie just not original."
" Denzel making the classic role of the Equalizer all his
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it is about a friendly stranger who chooses to fight for what's morally right. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Sometimes when mandem.

" a silent killer
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,10,"Yes its predictable, but that is not a problem at all. Denzel W.plays a guy who reminds me of ""the book of eli"" who kills 8 evil opponents at once. like: i am the nicest guy you have ever met, but you can not treat me like an idiot. you have been warned, but you didn't listen. in one scene he tells the dying gang leader: ""You should have taken the money"" D. Washington is brilliant in that role."
" Ok action movie, but has nothing to do with the TV series
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,7,"As an action movie, this would have rewarded 8 points, despite logical flaws (like, wtf, leaving fingerprints everywhere?). However, it's been styled as being about Robert McCall, the star of the TV series, but it's got nothing to do with that character. And that ain't Denzel Washington's fault, who did a stellar job, but that of the screenwriters and producers. The movie's McCaul is simply a totally different character from the TV guy. So, to advertise this movie as ""The Equalizer"" is fraud, there's no way to excuse it. Younger folks who don't know the series may not care about this, but if you had been a fan, you will be disappointed."
" Very conventional thriller
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,5,"""The Equalizer"" was somehow difficult to review since the movie never clearly shows where it wants to go. Without spoiling the story for people who are still interested in watching this movie, it is a very conventional American thriller about that lonesome guy who gets tipped over the edge and starts killing people. The movie barely evolves above TV storytelling and TV characters. It tries to be cool and stylish at times and a bit Deathwish-like but it fails to establish any kind of originality. Without Denzel Washington, and he plays the loner well, this movie would probably lose every incentive to watch it."
" ""Know how"" to be a decent citizen
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,8,"Call McCall.. if you need any help.. Solid action movie, convincing acting. enjoyable to watch. ""must see"" if you wanna be a hero."
" Another example of 'better left alone""
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,2,"Take a decades old, successful English TV series ""The Equalizer"", mix it up with an equally old film series ""Death Wish"", bring it up to the modern day and rack up the violence. Use tons of the chase and fight scenes you've seen in numerous other movies of this ilk and 'voilà' you have ""The Equalizer 2014"".Denzel Washington is a fine actor, why does he do trash like this?The sound editing and musical effects gained this movie an extra star."
" Loved it. Denzel great!
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,8,"Denzel has done this kind of role before in Man on Fire. He certainly can hold his own in this type of movie. His character Robert is very likeable. The violent set pieces are great to watch and filmed with skill. The villain Russian leader Martin Csokas reminded me so much of Kevin Spacey. he was credible, certainly better than Pascal in the 2nd movie but one weak link was the finale in the Home Improvement store. It went on for to long and was predictable. Also Chloe Grace Moretz goes missing for a large chunk of the movie. I felt it would have been better to have her around as she is a quality young actress. Still Denzel is class. Always watchable. Great movie."

" At its best when it isn't trying to be 'cool'; at its worst when it is.
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,5,"There's a slightly sadistic edge to a lot of the violence in 'The Equalizer (2014)', even to that perpetrated by our hero. It doesn't help that he's presented as a cold-blooded killer who often stares into the eyes of his struggling foes as the life slowly drains from them, someone who murders a number of people entirely of his own volition and not even in self-defence or in direct defence of others (though he does deal out death in order to 'help' people). The violence is so key to the plot, being used in all but one of the 'solutions' to the problems our protagonist aims to 'solve', and even the movie's overall arcs and messages, with our hero actively encouraged to go back to his violent ways and with those methods actually being somewhat endorsed as the only real way to 'win' even in a situation that could've perhaps been circumvented entirely, that the bloodshed feels highlighted almost to the point of glamorisation, as opposed to being shown in a graphic manner (perhaps more realistic than most) to emphasise its consequences - both physical and psychological - or its last-resort nature. These problems are emphasised because the flick clearly thinks it's incredibly 'cool' - with several moments utilising overt slow motion and an over-the-top score to try to convince you of its apparent 'coolness' and, in the process, completely reducing any effect the moment could've once had, instead of letting an inherently impressive moment naturally impress (at one point, even making a scene literally laughable). Despite the fact that it shoots itself in the foot, so to speak, and reduces its own impact through the very techniques it uses in an attempt to enhance it, the initial intention still shines through and actually makes for an experience that starts to, perhaps strangely, feel a little uncomfortable at times. It usually fails to provide enjoyment on either a serious or silly level, despite its occasionally successful character-work and some entertaining sequences. In reality, the first twenty minutes are actually the most successful. It's probably no coincidence that these occur before any of the killing kicks off, with the focus placed on likeable characters trying to help one another simply by being there and doing what they can. The best moments are the ones most akin to a quiet drama - and this is coming from someone who loves action cinema, by the way. This proves problematic, then, given that the whole point of the piece is that its protagonist is a vigilante. There's a key difference between hero and vigilante, though, and the film doesn't seem to understand that. There's no comment on his brutal methods or flawed morals. Most importantly, there's no real entertainment. 5/10"

Needing only, it seems, about 2 hours sleep a night, Bob frequents an all-night diner where he befriends prostitute Teri played by Chloe Grace Moretz. She ends up in the hospital thanks to some pimp heavies, and Bob exacts bloody justice on the guys. Unfortunately, these are the henchmen of a huge Russian mafia operation in the US, and Bob's fight becomes a full-scale war against the leader Pushkin (Vladamir Kulich) and his bad-guy-in-chief, the curiously named Teddy (played with menacing glee by Marton Csokas, Celeborn in. This movie is a cut above the normal mafia crime drama story. Washington's Bob is portrayed as an intelligent, thoughtful but deeply wounded man, and the audience can empathise with his burning desire to give back to society. Chloe Grace Moretz is (again) outstanding as the equally wounded Teri trying desperately to find a way out of the deep pit she finds her life to be in. Moretz looks set to continue her trajectory to become a Hollywood Great.And Csokas as the steely and cold Mafia killing machine makes for an extremely menacing villain."
" Good guy with almost superpowers
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,8,"Some people say this movie has zero story, I disagree, our beloved Denzel Washington is playing the role of a person with a big heart that helps people in need. What more story do you need? Very nice film, I always wanted to see bad people suffering in movies and good people succeeding."
" Denzel Washington is a baddas
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,10,This is a great action film always enjoy Denzel's movies the fighting scenes are brutal don't want Robert McCall on your bad side
" Moronic.
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,1,Probably the dumbest movie of all time. Might be watchable with a labotomy.
" No good
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,1,Sorry but only Edward Woodward or at least someone who resembles him can play the Equalizer (Denzel Washington doesn't by a long shot).
" Surprisingly good.
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,9,"I never really watched the TV series, I just saw it here and there, so I can't claim any 'fandom'. It was mostly a case of watching this as a standalone film. The revenge genre is one of my favourite genres and this film is a very worthy addition. It actually scared me at times, sort of like The Godfather did, but the direction, the script, the performances and cinematography are all top notch. I've not seen the second one yet, but I'm looking forward to it. Washington nails it, as usual. Is there anything he can't do?"
" What do you see when you look at me?
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,7,"Mark Twain once said; ""The two most important days in your life are the day you were born and the day you find out why."" ""The Equalizer"" opens with this quote. This quote reveals the purpose of the film and what to expect from it. In the first 10 minutes of the story, we get an intense character depiction of Robert ""Bob"" McCall (Denzel Washington). This description is very important for the development and progression of the film. Robert is a perfectionist and overly organized. He lives alone and works at a construction store. He has insomnia and when he can't sleep, he goes down to a 24/7 diner where he drinks tea and reads. In the beginning of the film he reads The Old Man and The Sea from Ernest Hemingway. If you know this book, you can easily relate the old man to him. His inner thoughts and dilemmas are similar to the old man's. Actually, in the first 10 minutes of the film, director Antoine Fuqua tells you more or less everything you need to know about Robert. After this point, nothing surprises you in the means of his life and actions. During his visits to the diner, he creates a special bond with a young Russian hooker Alina (Chloe Grace Moretz). They mostly discuss about the book and its effects on the real life. One night when Alina is beaten up and sent to hospital, he visits the Russian Mafia, who are selling her, and offer them $9800 to let her go. They refuse the money and after a little talk he kills all the five men in the room brutally in 19 seconds. The film actually starts after this point. This scene proofs that Robert is not an ordinary man, but a professional killer.""The Equalizer"" is a one man show. It is one man against the Russian mafia. This time, an American hero saves a Russian girl from the Russians. I normally hate this kind of stories where Americans are the good guys and Russians are the bad. Cold war is over and they keep making films like this. However, this one time, I will pass on this fact because the story is much more complex than just the Americans and Russians. Also, the main actor is one of my favorite actors of all time. I know this approach is not professional but I am not a professional critic anyway. As I said Robert is a highly trained killer. Through the story, we find out that he is a retired CIA black ops operative. He tries to live a quiet life, but this kind of guys can never be left alone. The more they try to stay away from trouble, the more trouble finds them. ""The Equalizer"" is a story of a guy like that.The story of ""The Equalizer"" is like a chess game. Both sides are trying very hard to win. They both think before they act and there is a constant attempt for anticipation of the opponent's move. This is the strongest point of the story. ""The Equalizer"" has the same idea as in John Wick or Taken series. There is one man against everyone else. The film is action packed and highly entertaining. It is maybe a little brutal but this doesn't change the course of the film. The soundtracks are equally beautiful. ""The Equalizer"" was loosely based on the 80s TV series of the same name. A couple of days ago, ""The Equalizer"" 2 was released, and tonight I am going to see it. This was the main reason why I have seen ""The Equalizer"" for the third time. After tonight, I am going to write also about the second film. No matter how cheesy they can get, I like stories like this. People like Robert are revengeful. No matter how good and fair they are, once you do something bad to them or to their loved ones, they never hesitate to go until the end.Denzel Washington's performance is outstanding and it sets the limits for the film. In films like ""The Equalizer,"" leading role performance is as important as the story itself, because everything is based on this performance. To be honest, I don't recall a bad film from Denzel Washington. I find a lot of similarities between him and Morgan Freeman. Washington's performance is not the only outstanding performance in the film. Marton Csokas, as Teddy Rensen/Nicolai Itchenko, puts an amazing performance as the villain of the film as well. He plays a highly trained sociopath. His performance makes an enormous difference. When both the good and the bad guy's performances are harmonized with a good story, you get to see a film like ""The Equalizer."""
" suspenseful
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,9,"Antoine fuqua is great, denzel washington is himself . love the suspense . aaaah ! the satisfaction when the character is a vigilante using his evil knowledge to do in the bad guys ... (until they go crazy themselves) ..."
" cool film
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,10,"Always love this kind of film. The good guy, after being abused comes out ahead. Big budget, like the way they slow down his actions and then speed up. Lots of feelings in this movie. Main guy helped lots of people cuz he is a good guy with a dark past. Good stuff."
" Breathtaking!
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,10,"What a surprise! Went into the theatre just expecting a regular action movie with Denzel taking the lead. Did not expect what I was gonna see. Great acting, memorable characters, decent story, action is amazing with a incredible performance by denzel. Wouldn't mind a sequel at all as plenty of depth to discover in the characters."
" Great movie
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,10,I saw this on FX recently in preparation for seeing Equalizer 2 with my brand new MoviePass (here's to hoping MP is still around for years to come!). I loved Equalizer. It was action-packed and not boring at all. Highly recommend!
" Not quite The Equalizer I remember
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,7,"As a fan of the TV series I was disappointed that this bears little resemblance to it's source material. That isn't to say this is a bad film. In the series Edward Woodward fed up working as an agent gave it up, but wasn't willing to let his expertise go wasted. He took out an ad to help those in need. He occasionally had help for former colleagues. He lived in a nice apartment. Drove a Jag. The very city of New York was almost a character unto itself. The Robert McCall Denzel plays him more like Liam Neeson in the Taken series. 
I guess my big problem is once again Hollywood has taken a property with name recognition. I enjoy this film for what it is, but I would still love to see a faithful adaptation of The Equalizer."
" A very good movie
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,8,Great movie until the last 10 minutes - DW further solidifies himself as one of the all time great actors - if ending was more plausible I would have rated it a 10. Fist fight in store would not have happened and Robert couldn't just hang out in the diner after these events. But even with a weak ending it was very good - looking forward to the sequel.
" Jhon Wick alike
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,5,"Russian Mafia, explosions and Denzel Washington... No very creative."
" In one word - badass
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,8,"I liked how the movie led the viewer into the story without giving a full background of Robert McCall's character (played by Denzel Washington). This way there's a little mystery lingering around him the whole movie and the viewer is given some bits and pieces that he or she can put together on their own.
That said, the peaceful start of the movie ""goes south"" real fast once McCall pisses off the wrong people so he becomes the target himself. One thing I can say for sure - you don't want to find yourself on Robert McCall's bad side.I found this movie really entertaining as it kept me in suspense the whole time and also guessing what twist might come next. The psychological battle between the protagonist and his nemesis was very well done. So were the fight scenes which were brutal and merciless at times.The ending and the resolution was a bit amusing to me, since Denzel unleashed his inner-MacGyver in order to deal with matters at hand. I might get some strange flashbacks the next time I visit supplies retail store :)"
" Denzel Washington made this film better than it was
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,8,"So I just finished watching Equalizer (EQ1) again, so I can watch Equalizer 2 (EQ2) for the comparison.It's too bad both films had the same director and writers, as they have a bad habit of dragging out the writing and the scenes. Both films at just over 2 hours is just way too long, especially in the simplistic singular plot or EQ1. However, that plot still worked, and mainly because of the entire casts especially Denzel Washington's performance(s). EQ2 certainly had better pacing and a more suspenseful plot - albeit predictable, however it had many plot issues and holes as well as some scenes that needed to be edited down. The new supporting cast was not as strong either. Which did I enjoy better? Probably EQ1 by a small margin, but they both got an 8/10 from me, as they each had their merits and issues. Nevertheless still enjoyable. I hope if they come out with a EQ3, they speed up the pacing within the writing and directing."
" Not nearly as good as 1st one, sigh
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,6,"Of course Denzel is the man and makes all movies look good BUT this script was terrible. The action scenes good, fight scenes better but everything else average and predictable. Hopefully this is the last one.Side note: disappointed that Denzel's first sequel was something as blasé as this. Any of his previous movies made as a sequel would have had more of an impact."
" Nothing new here, but some great action
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,7,"Denzel probably invented walking away from an explosion. Too be honest, he's got a dad bod, but he's still kick ass. Is it confidence? Not sure, but it's always a pleasure watching him kick butt. What else to say? Soundtrack isn't too bad, and some shots are very stylish and cool looking. Watched this for the third time in anticipation of the sequel...which I won't see in the theatre even though I did the first. I do remember enjoying the tv show this was based on. Yet another reason to get some retro tv channel..."
" Since the 70's Intro of Sick Revenge Fantasies, What's Happened?
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,1,"Well the Cold War ended. Violent crime rates plummeted. But Hollywood vigislaughtergore(new word) has sky rocketed. Words like pandering and exploitation come to mind. But especially hypocrisy. I doubt that a single person who works as an instructor of firearms would endorse this film genre. Certainly not anyone in the NRA. Then I ask myself why do some people want to give Washington a pass? He's successful and rich? Huh? Feudalism 2.0 has landed. People at the top of the social pyramid are just innately better than common folk. Well the ones that have been anointed by the media that is. I suppose it really helps to work in the media. I don't live near the media centers, where should I go to grovel? Is just paying for this crapola sufficient tribute?"
" A Denzathon all the way
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,7,"This is a thriller saved from B movie mediocrity if not for the standalone performance of Denzel Washington. He virtually carries the movie forward by the weight of his performance outshining all other characters including the main antagonist. 
Its a must watch for every action movie fan out there."
" A tad too over the top
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,7,"There is no bigger fan of Denzel Washington than yours truly. Dude is just great at his job. When a person's chosen profession is to portray other people than yourself, it's going to require a lot of studying. Or maybe just a lot of common sense.
 I think almost anyone with enough nerve can probably do some acting. All you have to do is watch how other folks do things in normal circumstances , and imitate them. 
 Yeah right... Denzel does every personality known to man in the most convincing way. From the super dork, to the cerebral peace keeper, to the slightly deranged family man, to the lovingly hateful detective. 
 I like real stuff in movies. The kind of thing that is actually possible for me or someone I know to witness on a given day. The ONE MAN ARMY kinda movie is not really in that realm. I mean does anyone actually have an affiliation with a person like this? Please tell me where these people live. 
 Hollywood has always done a good job of making Marvel comic heros seem to be normal. They make Gotham city and Metropolis look like everyday cities that just happen to have a dude in tights flying around saving days like kids save baseball cards.
 But I believe this should type of movie has its place. A place for anyone other than D.W. 
 I don't know. I just think he's above this kids stuff ...stuff that just CANNOT HAPPEN."
" Makes John Wick Look Realistic
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,6,"""The Equalizer"" is based off of an 80's TV show about an ex-spy/mercenary that helps people with problems that need to be solved outside the law, and while the movie ultimately sets this aspect up, most of the film just leads up to that point, and I have to assume isn't really connected that strongly to the show. 
Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua have worked together before in the memorable and very well-crafted ""Training Day"", but Equalizer shows that the people involved are only as good as the script, and that's where the weaknesses of this come into play, as well as some silly editing and scene-transitions. 
Middle-Aged Men action films are something of a sub-genre now after Taken, with multiple franchises and installments based around the concept, including the very popular John Wick series. You always use a jury of your peers, so John Wick is the peer to something like Equalizer, and is better because Wick established a stylized alternate world to our own and had well-practiced choreography without jump-cuts, edits, and slow-motion. Wick also got beaten up and ran out of ammo several times in the movie, and had to be saved by friends more than once; in short he was skilled but still human.
Denzel's Robert McCall almost never expends a shred of effort, with planning skills that would make Batman look like a sloppy procrastinator. It's still fun for what it is, and Chloe Moretz, Martin Csokas, and the rest of the cast do a great job in their roles, but the movie gets more and more absurd as it goes in terms of how resourceful and skilled McCall is, to the point that he singlehandedly takes down a wing of the Russian Mafia, disrupting their entire operation in Boston, and then travelling to Russia and killing the kingpin, all without much effort (even though he does sustain a gunshot wound to the shoulder, which isn't a big deal to him).
I love seeing heroes take on the bad guys, it's a great, timeless fantasy that can be very rewarding and inspiring if done well, but The Equalizer takes any suspense and drama out of the equation, and there's very little struggle on the part of the hero. Wick got outclassed in a hand-to-hand fight and James Bond routinely gets knocked around in his outings, but it's hard for me to root for a hero who at some point doesn't get taxed or pushed, no matter how resourceful they are.
It's saved by Denzel's solid-as-always performance and the rest of the cast, but The Equalizer has material that has been way better by much better productions."
" FANTASTIC MOVIRE
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,10,Just watched this movie! One of the BEST movies I have ever seen. I LOVED IT! Can't wait to see the Second one in a few weeks!!
" Can't wait for the sequel! - 79% (Very Good)
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,8,"Fun, quotable, stylish, and overall a really good action flick. Denzel is the ultimate badass."
" An amazing thriller film
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,9,"The equalizer is an action movie directed by Antoine Fuqua, where Denzel Washington is the leading actor. In this film, Denzel plays McCall, a man who is retired CIA operative and now he works at a hardware store. He belives that he has put his mysterious past behind him and now he can live a quiet life in Boston Massachusetts, but during his last nights reading a book in a restaurant he meet Teri a teenager prostitute under the control of Russian mafia, he can't stand the situation suffered by the girl and decide to help her.
Therefore, the equalizer is a great film to someone that like a good action, because it is full of this. In addition, the film talk about the traffic of women, where the women need to work such as prostitute in another country and suffer in hands of bad men. So, besides the good actions the film makes a criticism about this problem faced in our society."
" Breathtaking, phenomenal, astounding, remarkable!
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,10,"There's always something to improve but I had to give this movie 10/10. It movie was simply remarkable, and even though the story was predictable to an extent, It seemed to me as if every scene of the movie was carefully planned, directed, reviewed and redirected to make it look meaningful and extraordinary. At the very beginning there are several scenes shot at a small cafeteria where Denzel goes to read books and which also a young escort girl frequents. When they are having a conversation, the escort girl surprises Denzel with her knowledge of people - the small clues she learned to observe about people when working as an escort (""I'm Teri."" ""Bob."" ""You don't look like a Bob. You look like a Robert. Robert reads books like this. Bob watches TV.""). When she is severely beaten up by her pimp, Denzel decides to come back from his retirement and bring justice one last time. He then kills her pimp and everyone else in the room who underestimated him because of his age and calm personality. When Nicolai (Marton Csokas) comes to the city to clean up the mess and get rid of the killer (Denzel), he gathers all the information available until he narrows down the suspects to Denzel and pays him a visit impersonating a police officer investigating a murder (when leaving - ""I'll be in touch."" ""Don't you want to leave me your card, officer, in case I remember anything? That's what you policemen usually do, right?"" ""Must have given them all out."" ""How did you find me?""). Last but not least, the ending fighting scene was simply phenomenal - it was like Home Alone for adults - Denzel as Kevin and Marton with his mercenaries as the burglars who in this R-rated version didn't end up in jail. By the way, I really don't understand the negative reviews here. Enjoy!"
" great action movie and an excellent omage to the 80's show
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie. This is an action movie done right - at least for me that is. I find the pace, the character development all of it is right on track. It's not perfect by any means but I just LOVE watching bullies get whats coming to them and this movie delivers! I liked how Denzel's character has got OCD and is meticulous kind of explaining his odd way of calculating how he is going to do the things he does.There are no real surprises or twists here, we are introduced to the characters, told who is good and who is bad after that there is no explaining needed that the bad guys need a good ass kicking. Thats all this movie is, watching good guys fight bad guys. The way it's done though works for me, the music, setting, style and pace all make it an excellent movie that I think is worth watching again and again."
" Thrilling
",2018-06-11 00:00:00,8,"I must have missed this film when it came out, and in a way it's a bit of a shame because it is actually a pretty cool film. Come to think of it, it did remind me a lot of the television series Chuck, but only in the sense that the protagonist happened to be this Black Ops specialist who was working in a Bunnings style hardware store. Well, not quite Black Ops because he has retired, but in many ways he still seems to be set in his ways.
 Anyway, he has this habit of going to an all night diner around 1:00 am to have a cup of tea (and he even brings his own teabag, they just supply the water). So, he strikes up this conversation with this girl over time, and it soon turns out that she has landed up in a bit of trouble. She happens to be a prostitute, but not one that is doing it willingly, and her pimps are basically treating her as a disobedient possession. As such he decides to go and teach them a lesson. Well, he is polite at first, but these type of people tend to be so cock-sure that he eventually shows them who they are actually messing with.
 Well, one doesn't simply walk into a restaurant owned by the Russian Mob and pretty much take everybody out without drawing some attention to yourself, and this is basically what happens. A highly trained special forces operative, who happens to be the guy that cleans up messes for the mob boss, comes over to the United States to find out what is going on. Well, I guess you can probably see where this is going.
 It isn't really one of those fast paced movies, at least at first, but that has more to do with the cat and mouse nature of the protagonists. Both are quite highly trained soldiers, though one of them doesn't like to let it on, while the other seems to want to show off his skill any change he gets. It seems to relate to the various types of power relations - soft power and hard power. One rules by the first, while the other simply rules through what he doesn't do. We obviously suspect who comes out on top in this particular movie, but then again the ending is generally pretty much set out right from the beginning.
 I guess this film touches on a few things, but once again it seems that the Russians are being painted as the enemy. Even if it isn't a hangover from the Cold War, it does seem to create this stereotypical image of the brutal and hard Russian who lives by his own rules. Once again they seem to be taking upon the mantle of the bad guys, and even if they aren't KGB, they are Russian Mafia, but the difference is that they tend to be somewhat less refined. However, when compared to other mafia group, they do come across as the more brutal and nasty of them. 
 Yet it was still a pretty cool movie, and there were a couple of little subplots thrown in as well, which all tie up nicely in the end. However, one interesting thing is that they don't always show our protagonist acting, sometimes, such as when he went after the armed robber, there is only an implication of what actually happened. We know he found him, but we don't know what he actually did to him - we just know that he eventually got what he wanted. This was well done in a way.
 It's a pretty cool movie, and certainly worth watching, though one of the main reasons I wanted to watch it was because I saw a preview for the sequel where he happens to be posing as an Uber driver."
" Possibly the best action film ever made
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,10,"If you 're a fan of movies with every day bad a$$ heroes then this one is for you, basically Denzel plays a retired government agent/assassin, but he is now working at a diy storestore, he meets a woman who wants to be a singer but is being exploited by Russian gangsters, Denzel is a firm believer in helping his friends achieve their goals and does not like to see injustice, so anyway he helps the lady he met out of her situation, but in doing so opens up a whole can of worms. If you like movies like die hard & John wick but don't like this movie then you may have to ask yourself a question am i a racist? Only joking.. Sort of !"
" Just amazing
",2018-04-27 00:00:00,9,"This movie was simply superb!! The plot is very simple yet manages to make a huge impact on the audience. The director has shown that a simple plot can be made into a brilliant movie. Cheers to Mr. Fuqua for that.Coming to the acting, Denzel Washington was just too good in his role. I believe no one else could have portrayed Robert McCall any better in a movie than him. The intensity that his character was supposed to possess was clearly shown. Chloe-Grace Moretz as the teenage prostitute was also good in her small role. The villain played by Marton Csokas was also good.One of the best things about this movie are its themes which are dark, gritty and violent. The action scenes were very well done especially the climax scene in the warehouse. Another thing I loved is the concept of the movie. Denzel plays an ex-CIA special forces officer who left his job to live a quiet life as he promised his deceased wife. But seeing a young girl in trouble, he decides to get back in action and goes on a violent rampage against the Russian mafia. In a certain way this movie sends a great message to the society that there are still good people out there who are ready to help all those who are oppressed. Watching this movie will make you wish for the existence of someone like Robert McCall in real life who would provide vigilante justice which is something the world desperately needs especially with all the atrocities being commited around the world on certain groups
of people.Overall this is a great movie and a wonderful action thriller which also has a good story that the audience can enjoy and I'm eagerly waiting for The Equalizer II."
" Did not feeled like a new modern action flick
",2018-04-25 00:00:00,6,"I consider this movie to be an attempt of comparing with John Wick. I'm not saying that I'm a fan of John Wick but The Equalizer was not that hitman action movie that i wanted to see. I feeled like inwas watching the transporter but instead of Jason Statham was Denzel Washington. The begining of the movie went slow, very slow the the action began for a short moment and it was impressive. I dont really know what happened but the ending wasn't as i expected or thought, it was boring and too long. It's true that a hitman should kill without making noise or by engaging in gun fight only if necesarry but this one was a bit boring. Oh and the russian mafia cliche is getting kinda' old"

" Hollywood Version of Mentoring
",2018-02-20 00:00:00,8,"Take the action portion out from this movie and we see an older man who gains a sense of purpose defending and mentoring the young. If just for this message, this movie is worth viewing! There is a dignity Denzel's character gives to life. Whatever his true inner purpose, he is taking action to help those in need. Yes, it is the Hollywood version of a human with superhero skills. I guess it is simply too much to make a movie of just a normal guy or gal who gives to others. The subtext here is important--we need mentors, especially those who can defend the weak, innocent, and vulnerable! It gives hope and restores dignity from those who rob it."
" Entertaining
",2017-12-11 00:00:00,8,"Acting: Denzel Washington and Chloë Grace Moretz did their best and were obviously the best in the movie. What surprised me was the performance of Marton Csokas(whose resemblance to Kevin Spacey is striking). It was way better than I expected. The others did well enough. 8/10Direction and cinematography: Antoine Fuqua is really starting to grow on me. His style is clear and very easy to follow. Direction was great in this movie. 9/10Soundtrack: Average. I liked the Eminem song during the subtitles, Guts Over Fear. 7/10Plot: The first two thirds of the movie were great. The final act was.. not so great. It wasn't bad either, but when the main hero is so perfect, you know he's coming out of everything alive and safe. The villain was pretty good, I was afraid I'd have to sit through the entire movie with that first Russian villain. Thankfully, he was just here so we could see how much of a bad-ass Washington's character is. I liked the restaurant scene, it reminded me of Heat. Very well written(the whole movie, not just the Heat scene). 8/10Overall: It was much more entertaining than I though it would be. A pleasant surprise. Best scene: Restaurant."

",2017-11-06 00:00:00,8,"I sort of remember the mid-80's TV series The Equalizer, and I sort of remember watching a few episodes. I certainly don't remember the late Edward Woodward kicking serious bad-dude-ass like Denzel Washington does as Robert McCall!First, the bad news. I know every bad-dude-ass-kicker looks good in the near-dark, lit only by a single 7k Xenon sitting high atop a Skyjack 25-yards yonder, with the pouring ""rain"" twinkling all around in the background and rolling off said bad-dude-ass-kicker's weathered face and squared jaw, but was it really necessary here? I mean, come on, it looked like it was done on purpose...and not in a good way. The scene I'm talking about could have been shot somewhere else to have the same impact. Worst. Shot. Ever.More bad news: Open Memo to Hollywood: We get it, the Russians are the bad guys again but please stop, for the love of Igor, stop using non-Russian speaking actors to fill the roles needed - especially Henchmen and smaller speaking roles. We hate it when ""Russians"" are actually Americans pretending to be Russian after spending an hour with a dialect coach in their trailer before their scene (I'm looking at you-who-shall-not-be-named-but-starred-in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). (Ok, so I exaggerated that a teeny bit, but her accent was terrible in that movie.) Anyway, I digress. For this movie, I'm talking about the horrible Russian spoken by Chloë Grace Moretz. She plays an underage Russian prostitute with perfect English, but horrible Russian. I guess that's better than a horrible English accent and horrible Russian! I knew nothing about the plot of the movie and I didn't even know she was a Russian prostitute until the bad guys showed up! Chloë is a great actress, and for her limited screen time did well...save for the parts where she needed to speak Russian! For the sake of credibility, another talented and beautiful female actress - from Russia - could have worked just fine. It's a small role with limited screen time (even Chloë's name on the one-sheet seemed like an afterthought.)Now the good news: Denzel, belovedly referred to as ""dedushka"" (grandfather) by the Russians, and ""Pops"" by his co-workers at the local ""Home Mart"" (and that's another thing, why not make a little sponsorship cash and have Robert McCall work at Home Depot?) seriously kicks some bad-dude-ass! His character is a little OCD (I can relate) and quite inventive (oh, the things one can do with a corkscrew in under 19 seconds)!I loved Denzel in Tony Scott's Man on Fire (2004). He was almost born to play these kinds of characters (I know, right). The Equalizer is a good action film that will keep your attention, but no gnarly 80's tunes to bring you back to the days when a middle aged Edward Woodward was playing the dedushka (hmm, the Russians were our enemies then too)."
" What was the point again?
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,4,"This movie is lifted up by the presence of Denzel & Chloe but when the action starts it just feel like something is missing and the slow-motion moments is used way too much. It just feels like there is no point to this whole movie. And I tried to get it why Robert (Denzel Washington) did what he did. But nope I was completely lost all the time and even at the end when the kingpin in Russia asked the same question , why? And I first thought Denzel would say; Uh, I don't know.I mean he didn't even know the little girl, and didn't even trust her enough to tell her what happened to his wife etc. Nope it just felt like another brainless go in and kill everyone. And I don't get it at the end all over sudden he couldn't take down one guy? Nope this movie was all over the place so yeah I was really disappointed."
" Amazing in its prescience of Russian meddling
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,9,"Odds against you? Need help? Indeed, the Hillary Clinton campaign could have called upon the Equalizer to battle against the Russian- led fake news in the 2016 presidential campaign. Just in case you're wondering, Miriam Webster defines prescience as ""foreknowledge of events"" and it seemed this 2014 blockbuster really seemed to have its finger on the pulse when it came to the Russian gangsters who are infecting the American social fabric.I'm a huge fan of The Equalizer TV series, and this movie carries on the fine tradition that's for sure. No messing around by McCall. He gets the job done, delivers justice and rails against police corruption. Perhaps in the sequel he can also rail against the TSA agents who like to pick on minorities, and maybe McCall deliver his own kind of justice to them.Melissa Leo and Bill Pullman play former CIA operatives, and it's good to know Melissa's character can beat rush hour traffic by getting a lift home in a helicopter. It beats having to encounter the TSA brutes at the airport."
" Superb action flick.
",2017-08-31 00:00:00,10,"Robert McCall (Denzel Washington) is a retired CIA black ops operative who lives quietly in Boston, Massachusetts and works at a Home Mart hardware store; McCall befriends many of his co-workers and helps a security guard trainee named Ralph pass his qualification exam. McCall promised his recently deceased wife that he would leave his old life behind. Unable to sleep, McCall spends some late nights reading in a 24/7 diner where he befriends Alina (Chloë Grace Moretz), a teen aged prostitute for the Russian Mafia; McCall regales Alina with philosophical interpretations of the book he is reading (The Old Man and the Sea)."
" Not a bad movie
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,7,"This is a bad ass movie.Denzel Washington's role is cool. The fight scenes and cat and mouse scenes are cool too. The atmosphere set and the tempo is cool too. A little tad too long at 2.11 hours, otherwise cool movie. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have an action flick.7/10"
" Very good action movie, bad thriller
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,7,"In this film, Antoine Fuqua presents us a former CIA agent who embarks in a fight against Russian pimps. Robert McCall, played by Denzel Washington is an awesome man, arriving has killed 5 men with their own weapons and a corkscrew. He is impressed by his mastery of the fight but also and above all by his inhuman cold blood, he manages to pierce the skull of a man without flinching. The character is very imposing and we attach to it but what caused me problem in this film is: Why? Why embark on it? Just because he's attached to a young prostitute? I find it difficult to get there unfortunately. This film is still a good action movie but as far as the plot is concerned, we will go back, it still deserves 7/8 because the action is very successful. Very good action movie, bad thriller."
" Passable action gimmick that could have been something more.
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,6,"The first few scenes of the Equalizer suggest that it is going to be an intelligent movie, and then it turns into a gimmick....Denzel Washington the untouchable action hero.There are individual scenes in the movie that are quite rousing and filmed with flair and panache. It's easy enough to argue that The Equalizer is a perfectly good action movie, but for the intelligent viewer, it is too hard to get completely emerged in because there are too many distractions.The script has a disjointed feel to it and it leaves its hero under underdeveloped. It's always nice to see Washington as a top tier bad ass, who is as untouchable as the younger Steven Seagal, but after fter one action scene you get the feeling that this movie is going to allow him to come away from every fight without even a scratch or a moment of hesitation. And then comes the ultimate action gimmick of all; a scene concludes with him walking away in slow motion from an explosion.The climax of the movie involves a one against ten face off in hardware megastore. Here we start to border on satire as Washington disposes of his enemies one at a time using the merchandise. these images will put a smile on your face, but they go on too long.The Equalizer, like Taken, is an action movie that doesn't rise above the sum of it's parts and leaves you a little dumbfounded about how seriously to take it.. There are dramatic undercurrents in they story that would have elevated the movie if director Antoine Fuqua has not chosen to abandon them."
" It glued me to my sofa; can't walk away even the nature's called.
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,10,"It is not a Run-of-the-mill (ROTM) action movie with ton of explosions and gun fires. It is one of a kind. Generally speaking, ROTM action movies always hurry to tell watchers who is a guy and his background, and also his motivation/reason of action. That is almost tell us everything. Then, nothing left is be explained, and he just shoots at everything that moves. On the other end of the spectrum, this movie tells us nothing ... oh, he is just an employee in Home Mart at Boston. Well, it seems that he enjoy his job but not his life. What's next? He might have something in his mind, or a ghost form the past, perhaps! The director (Antoine Fuqua) and writer (Richard Wenk) just know how not to be spoon-feeders.If Denzel Washington is white, he is very fit to Agent 47 role.I have got nothing else to say, but it is Must-watch film."
" It's only a movie!
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,10,"The Equalizer is certainly not an original. Movies like The Matrix or Bourne Supremacy come up from time to time to make our head spin. The rest of the time, you get junk. The Equalizer is somewhere in between. Solely because Danzel Washington plays an interesting character very well. The rest of the cast is also excellent. The direction and photography makes it enjoyable to watch. It seems to me that many viewers are addicted to fast pace movies. If it's a bit slow starting, they tune off. I don't mind personally. Not every action movie has to be fast and furious. There are people, who like fast pace and others who enjoy some thinking time, or are simply waiting for a break in the action to go to the bathroom. Your wife or girlfriend won't likely appreciate the violence, but in this kind of action movies, you expect the baddies to act evil. I found The Equalizer enjoyable. Love the atmosphere and waited patiently to see the bad guys get wasted. It's always a satisfying feeling. Short of ever seeing that kind of outcome in the real world, we're bound to see many more of these movies, good and bad, in the future."
" Very underrated film
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,7,"Despite this been a pretty solid film it is generally criticized in the film community. It is an action film but a well-structured film. Denzel's character does fool with you which such a simplistic approach to life that does not prepare you for the rest of the journey. To those who enjoy Taken, you must enjoy this.We discuss why we like this film on our movie podcast:https://goo.gl/Skr065"
" The Old Man's Gotta Be The Old Man; The Fish Gotta Be The Fish...
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,8,"This is not the Robert McCall I grew up watching and that isn't a bad thing. I like the idea that writer Richard Wenk and director Antoine Fuqua reenvisioned the 1980's character for the modern era. As always Denzel Washington is superb and brings a new dimension to the character of The Equalizer.Robert McCall is a warehouse worker in a D I Y retail store who at work helps his fellow employees, though out of work he's a solitary character with a habitual routine that verges on obsessive compulsive disorder. Each night he goes to the same diner and sits at the same table and orders a cup of water, into which he drops a teabag. While there he reads a book, he's on number 97 of the top 100 books to read before you die. He has a conversational relationship with one of the prostitutes that use the diner as a way station. This relationship becomes stronger and when she comes in battered and bruised McCall takes it upon himself to help her out...From here on in you begin to learn of McCall's secret past as the action and violence amps up. McCall is a dark man who keeps his feelings in check though you never get to find out what makes him such a cold and logical executioner. This may be because there are more works in the pipeline, I hope so as this was an enjoyable movie.The only irksome element of the story and movie is the relationship between McCall and the prostitute Teri, played by Chloe Grace Moretz. As I previously stated, their relationship takes on an extra vitality. However, when she's hospitalised, he goes to the hospital though never makes contact and this is the last we see of her until the end; and this appears to have been an afterthought to give McCall a more humanistic presence. I think if the characters had more scenes together throughout the movie this could have help to detract from McCall's cold robotic personality. Maybe this wasn't the director's vision.There's nothing in this film that hasn't been covered in other movies but that doesn't stop this from being an entertaining 132 minutes; It kept my attention so well that it really doesn't seem that long a film.If you enjoyed the series, or like action films, or love Denzel Washington (or all three), then this film will be right up your street."
" Another Denzel Washington Triumph
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,7,"I can't remember ever watching a Denzel Washington film I didn't enjoy and this one was no exception.I can remember English actor Edward Woodward pioneering the original American, made for television series, back in the late 1980s and bringing the role of Robert McCall to our screens.Denzel does amazing justice to the film version of this debut vigilante role, with a strong story line full of action and violence and a depth of character which sets the scene nicely for any follow-ups which may come along ... 'The Equalizer' is born!"
" surprisingly good
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,8,"This was way better than I expected, although Denzil has made some poor films in his time this was certainly not one of them. Better than the original TV series with Edward Woodward, although done on a far larger budget I thought it had Paul Greengrass written all over it until I saw the credits. The music score deserves some acknowledgement too. I Only hope the following episodes are just as gripping."
" an equalized john wick?
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,9,"if u ask me which is better , john wick 2 or the equalizer , i ll say with no hesitation, the equalizer...the hero is a badass too yes, kicking asses , putting traps, predicting everything, but its Denjel! a good actor! and the movie has a plot! a believable plot, although some clichés are here too..in fact the entire story is upon Denjel s shoulders..and he made it ! his fight style is also natural and well performed and not gun fights and shot heads like Wick s...the villains are also believable in their part...well, i enjoyed it!"
" Denzel Is Back!
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,7,"Over the past couple of years, Denzel Washington went from Hollywood A-lister to serious disappointment. ""Safe House"" was a disaster, ""Flight"" was okay at best, and movies like ""Pelham 123"", ""Unstoppable"" and ""2 Guns"" are a dime a dozen. Where was the Denzel from the mid- 2000s, where films like ""Deja Vu"" and ""Man on Fire"" showcased him at his best? I almost didn't even go see ""The Equalizer"" because I was so afraid of another disappointment. Luckily, while not perfect by any means, this film shows that Denzel does still have greatness in him.For a basic plot summary, ""The Equalizer"" tells the story of Robert McCall (Washington), a genial man who works at a home repair retail store. While warm, genial, and helpful at work, Robert's home life paints a different picture. He lives alone, a slave to routine and very little joy, and frequents a late-night dinner due to insomnia. At that diner, Robert strikes up some casual conversations with Teri (Chloe Grace Moretz), a young prostitute, and gets to know her on a more personal level. One night, Teri shows up with bruises covering her face. The next night, she doesn't show up at all. This leads Robert (who obviously has a very violent past) to do what needs to be down to find her abusers.""The Equalizer"" could almost be a sequel to ""Man on Fire"" in terms of acting and intensity. Denzel plays a very similar role (very much based on vengeance) and shows with ease that he can still be ""the tough guy"" when needed. What truly makes the movie great, though, is that director Antoine Fuqua (who also directed Denzel's breakout hit ""Training Day"") knows how to utilize the great actor to his furthest potential. The first half of the film is set up so well that even a paint-by-numbers second half is forgivable because viewers are already snagged hook, line, and sinker.That being said, this isn't a five-star, all-time effort for a couple of different reasons. It becomes a bit predictable and over-the-top in the second half. Whereas ""Man on Fire"" was able to sustain both the intensity and emotional energy for the entire runtime, this film drops the emotional stuff in favor of sheer brutality at times. Remember those scenes from ""First Blood"", where Sly Stallone's John Rambo sets forest traps for the police officers hunting him? Well, a similar scenario plays out in this one...only involving home-improvement equipment in a retail store! I would have preferred a bit more emotion and character development (specifically more about McCall himself) in the movie's second act, but it doesn't fall completely flat because the ""bad guys"" are such scum-bags that you don't mind the gruesome violence.Thus, despite its obvious flaws, ""The Equalizer"" is more than good enough to vault Denzel back into the spotlight that an A-list career like his deserves. A quote from the film has McCall telling another character ""you got to be who you are in this world...no matter what"". After a number of misfires, Denzel gets back to ""who he is"" with this exciting, bombastic film. Not his best, but puts him on the right track again."
" Denzel being brilliant - a very good film
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,6,"I remember seeing The Equaliser, the TV show, when I was young, staring Edward Woodward. This is the same, but totally different.Denzel plays Robert ""Bob"" McCall, and we see him initially start his days in simplicity, in a mundane job, in a simple home, reading, not sleeping and enjoying quiet solitude and routine. The pace of the film can be described the same way. Quiet solitude and routine. Nothing happens loudly or quickly and you have to pay attention. Denzel is at his charming best. Think Training Day, think Safe House and Magnificent Seven with the charm of the Prince in Much Ado About Nothing.Antoine Fuqua, Director, also working with Denzel on Training Day and Magnificent Seven, is flawless, seamless and deeply committed to a viewing experience that immerses the viewer. Often, more often than not, lighting is low in The Equalizer and little is said or explained. What happens in the dark, is salient but not narrated. This makes for a slow burning piece of great cinema; tension and pressure mount and you feel it. Like John Wick (Keanu Reeves) as ""Baba Yaga"" - the bogeyman - Washington's dealings with Russian mob are equally devastating, accomplished and quiet.Watching the film, you don't know who Robert McCall is, just the guy in the 24hour diner reading through the list of 100 books before you die (incidentally I'm shamefully only on 30), and making tentative friends with Alina or ""Teri,"" brilliantly played by Kick Ass star Chloe Grace Moretz, the young prostitute. You don't know who he is, but that is drip fed to you through the film. Unlike other heroes McCall doesn't do what he does for glory or recognition, he does it for justice and moral right. You don't hear Teri's story either, which is a blessing, but not having backstories and motivations narrated is a clever ploy for you to fill in your own blanks, or keep the pace quiet and slow. Moretz and Washington's friendship is lovely and believable. He is a trustworthy person, and like his unobtrusive violence, righting wrongs, you don't see sexual violence in this film either; the awful things Teri has to endure are not spelled out, which is a relief. Less is more. Martin Csokas, a good actor, but known for his hammy portrayal and terribly overdone Russian accent in XXX, was perfectly cast here. He too played it understated and deadly with the confidence or someone who has never been realistically challenged before, possibly drawing on his experience of playing Celeborn in LOTR ... quiet graceful and deadly! When I say unobtrusive violence, meaning you don't always see it, sometimes you do. This is not a film for under 15s by any stretch of the imagination. There's some very up close uses for common household items put to alternative use in the film. If you are a bit squeamish or sensitive, don't watch. That said, Fugua uses darkness and suggestion well even in these scenes. Everyone in the cast put in performances to be proud of, but Washington of course was the stand out. He truly is a phenomenal performer. Whatever he touches is golden, and I very much like seeing age and experience, and economy of violent movement, showing professionalism and realism over glamour and youth and showy unrealistic fight scenes any day. Especially with Denzel! Marton Csokas, known for his terrible Russian accent and hammy acting in XXX, is infinitely more formidable as a Russian mob fixer, here."
" Best Bad Ass Movie ever possibly IMHO
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,10,"Great story, and the character build up was done so well with this movie that you can't help but get sucked in and love Denzel. The story is unique but it has to do with the timing of the release. It's possibly that this movie would be ""just another one of those"" types of movies which I can't state as I don't want to spoil anything. Then end is very well done, which is hard to do as a lot of movies are ruined by the very fact that they don't hit the bulls eye, sometimes they come close and sometimes they completely miss the mark. With this movie, I think they hit the bulls eye, so you have a good movie and a good ending. No one will not enjoy this movie, and if you're a Denzel fan, it may become your favorite? Now I want to watch Man on Fire again and I will definitely be watching this movie again, this goes into the family, movie library."
" Could be the classics but turned to be just another action movie...
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,6,"To say frankly, I have just came across this movie by chance. Checking out new movies and saw Denzel starring. I watched the trailer and thought ""Hmmm, it could be interesting, maybe something different"". I still remember those recent ""Taken"" and ""John Wick"" masterpieces (rather poor plot, but masterful direction and best ever action and fights). So watching again the same ""bad Russians in the USA"" and great deal of clichés I felt nothing but bitter disappointment. Well, wait for another try... P.S. Russian gangsters' bodies are not the canvasses for painting. The more does not mean the better..."
" Paint by Numbers
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,3,"The movie is a series of clichés. Denzel saves it from being 0 stars.One cliché this didn't have was the bad guy operative being an old associate of Washington's character.Slow mo walking away after whipping the bad guys? Check.Slow mo walking away from an explosion? Check.Getting ready to ambush the bad guys? Check multiple times.The bad guys burst into the room, but the good guy isn't really in that room? Check.Declaration ""I am the storm"" or ""I am the something"" aka ""I am a bad ass""? Check.Someone asking ""who are you""? Check multiple times.Scoping out the room than whipping all the bad guys? Check multiple times.It was easy to whip the bad guys, but I'm a little rusty? Check.Hero knows his home turf? Check.Give the bad guys a chance to walk away. but they don't?
