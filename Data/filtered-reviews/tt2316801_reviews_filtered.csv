" It's very hard for me to gather the words to express how amazing this movie is!!!
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,"The American interpretation of ""The Beauty and the Beast"" has nothing at all on the French interpretation of this astonishing story. The music, camera angles, the scenery, the COSTUMES, DESIGN, AND DETAILS are absolutely PREFECT!!!!
The whole time I kept on repeating ""The details!!!!""
This movie left me with a feeling that I can only try to fill by watching it a million times more. Amazing."
" Almost perfect but no drama musical on it!
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,9,The movie has potential to be great but there was missing part that made it imperfect to wit no drama musical on it.
" Vive la France!!!
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,10,"I've waited seven years to watch this. English dub. Not complaining either. This by far, best version of this title. Cinematography, sets, wardrobe, cast, director, crew, graphic artists, et el...superb. I'll see it again and again just to view it all. One perusing does not do you justice. Stop nitpicking, it's originally French, their story, telling of the book as well. Disney didn't come close with their live action, though I loved it too. Enjoy it for the rich fantasy it is. As I do all of its incarnations. 10/10 x infinity+ = Elatedness."
" Yawn. The Umpteenth Version of Beauty & the Beast.
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,6,"Was this version necessary? Nope. Sure, there was gorgeous scenery and landscaping as well as a lot of time spent on the set design and soundtrack, but without the audience (that's us) emotionally involved in the story, it was just a 2 hour blur of a well-worn tale. This version is closer to the Czech story line from the 1976 version that, say, the award winning Disney animated version from 1991. In a way, I preferred the Czech version even if it was much more primitive than this CGI rendition. Recommended? Not really, only for completionists like myself."
" The best version
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,10,"Really love that movie, actors, costumes, stunning castle. I enjoyed every minute of watching this movie."
" The best original live action CGI Beauty and the Beast this French film offers.
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,10,"I have seen this non Disney live action movie Beauty and the Beast and I loved it very much, I loved the CGI animation, special effects and beautiful scenery that Christopher Gans directed. I also liked the cast Vincent Cassel and LÃ©a Seydoux. I also loved the music soundtrack score very much.The children are read a bedtime story, Belles father is a merchant, his merchant ships gets caught in a storm, 2 of them sink and the 3 one is confiscate to pay for his debt. Belle and her brothers and sisters are forced to move out of their house into the countryside. She asks her father for a rose, he goes over to the town at the seaport and is threaten with violence and leaves to go home, he gets lost in the woods and takes refugee in the Beasts castle, he rests, eats food and before he goes home, he picks the red rose and the Beast threatens to kill him for stealing a rose, the father begs for his life and heads straight home and tells Belle she's wanted at the castle. Belle takes off and lives at the Beasts castle.Belle explores the beasts castle and has dreams about the Beast who was once a man, he neglects his wife who's a princess because he's hunting the golden deer. She meets the cute dog creatures called Tadums who play with her. The Beast asks Belle if she will marry him but she refuses each time.There's a hetero love moment where she dances with a Beast which was amazing to watch, one night she becomes scared and runs off in the woods at the lake, she falls in but the Beast rescues her. Finally the Beast gives in Belles request to return home to her sick father, her brother Maxime sees a Jewel on Belle his sister and goes over to Perducas to form a mob and to invade and storm the Beasts castle. Belle has a dream with the Prince killing the golden deer which turns out to be his wife and he is cursed to be a Beast and his hunting dogs turn into Tadums and his people into statues.Belle heals her father and they ride over to the Beast castle to stop the fight with the giants killing Perducas men, Perduca stabs the Beast and he gets cursed and turns into a tree and dies, Belle tells the Beast she loves him and he turns back into a human prince, the Tadums turns back into hunting dogs and the statues back into people and the movie ends with the children playing in the garden and Belle greets the prince and her father's a flower merchant and they lived happily ever after.First of all, I liked the costumes, Belle and the Beast wore, it was very amazing, I liked Belle how she stood up for herself against the beast and how she had to learn to get along, I also liked how the Beast was doing his best to be a gentleman and cared about Belle very much and saved her life from drowning in the lake, I was sad when the beast died but he came back to life as a human prince. I liked her father and felt sorry for him when he lost his sunken ships, I liked her brothers and sisters although I didn't like how her oldest brother fought with his younger brother Tristan and joined the mob. I didn't like Perduca who was greedy for money, he reminded me of Gaston from the Disney movie.I also liked the cute Dog Tadums. I also liked the ballroom dance party. I also liked the CGI special effects and scenery it was so beautiful. I was sad when the prince accidentally killed the golden deer which turned out ot be his wife. I was a little surprised to see partial nudity in this movie thought it's not fully shown. I also liked the waltz soundtrack by Pierre Adenot and the end credits song by Yoann Freget called Sauras Tu M'Aimer .Overall this is the best Beauty and the Beast adapted film of all time. It's a shame that it's forgotten by most people in America, I think they should give this film a chance, it's too bad this didn't win any awards for best Special effects, best live action fantasy film. also I prefer this non Disney 2014 live action version over the 2017 Disney remake which I would forget about.If I could rate this film. It would be rated PG-13 for mild language, partial nudity, thematic elements, some violence, peril, some scary scenes."
" A wonderful movie
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,10,"A wonderful movie. Stuffed details, masterful acting. Wonderful finale! A splendid and magical setting suitable for both small and large. The favorite adaptation of this tale."
" Nothing more beautiful...
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,10,"...may be imagined. This is so beautiful that I gasped several times at the truly stunning images before me. As a child I particularly loved this tale and nothing could improve on the romantic imagination of a little girl, I thought, it never has before but this exceeded anything I imagined and in every way I found it truly satisfying. It captivates, enraptures with beauty beyond the gorgeous and fantastical dreams of a child. Perfect and I highly recommend to all those who are interested."
" DNF
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,5,"There was something about this that I just found unwatchable. Hated the dubbing, but the movie looks beautiful"
" Lovely
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,7,Lovely story. It's actually quite refreshing to not know who the actors are for a change. We got to focus on the movie more for this reason.
" Great scenery and actors, boring plot.
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,5,"I don't want to get you bored with long texts. My personal opinion is that 2 very good actors (Bella and Cassel) are wasted in a film with slow and uninteresting plot.The same thing goes for the director. The special effects are great, the backgrounds and the places are awesome but it's just that.PS. I saw it with French audio + subtitles so I may have missed a lot of important details. Sorry about that."
" the most beautiful fairy tale movie ever!
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,9,"La Belle et la Bete, in its French title, was a very popular movie in France thanks to the 1940s version with Jean Marais as the Beast. This new version pays clear homage to that older movie -- the beast, in particular, is very close and some of the scenery is very similar -- but it modernizes and takes full advantage of color.The scenes around the ruined palace, the simply astounding, gorgeous, amazing dresses that Belle wears in succession there, the color effects with rose petals, the contrast between the green enclosure and the forbidding ice cliffs guarding it (as much guarding against exit as against entrance, it must be noted), all add to the purest imagery in any fairy tale movie ever made.
An Oscar should be voted by acclamation for the people who created Belle's four dresses (white, green, blue, and red, each with matching jewelry, and, for the red dress, riding cape).The modernization comes through an extended prologue (other versions just have Belle's father get lost right away), a corrresponding shortening of the developing relationship between Belle and the Beast -- you can tell she is growing fonder, but it appears to happen very quickly, which is actually a much better match to the fairy tale style, where time is very elastic -- and the attack on the castle, which Walt Disney in its 2017 movie sugarcoats as an attempt to free Belle by the villagers, regains meaning and strength as an attack by bandits with whom one of Belle's brothers has fallen. The overall tone is dark for much of the movie -- the tale is meant to be terrifying for much of its length, something Disney unavoidably abandons very early.Fairy tales, except in Disney versions, have a lot of shading in their characters and this movie successfully renders these shadings, from the nearly purely evil head bandit to the nearly (but not quite ;-) purely good Belle. I could have done without the silly and vain sisters, but they are part of the tale and serve to demonstrate that Belle is able to love even those who do not treat her well and whose foibles are all too obvious to her. In the Disney version, the Beast was nearly pure evil before he was turned into a Beast and is, except for some anger management issues, purely good by the time Belle meets him. Not so in this movie, although he, like Belle, changes very fast -- again, the movie follows fairy tale traditions of compressing time at will.
(There are a lot of reviews that downgrade this movie because it does not develop the romance between Belle and the Beast. Developing romances is not what fairy tales were about! Characters in these tales get very little choice in their actions -- their actions are dictated by the necessity to address important themes and stimulate/frighten/delight children into good behavior while entertaining them. Children do not ""get"" romances anyway, but they do like people living happily ever after. Sleeping Beauty gets swept off her feet by the Prince after one wake-up call, er, kiss; Cinderella gets a few hours of ballroom dancing. Belle, in this movie, gets three full days and four nights full of highly informative and emotionally significant dreams at the castle -- far more than your average fairy tale heroine before tying her fate to some guy. And, in any case, these days and nights at the castle are, by fairy tale tradition, out of time -- they can last as long as you want them to, you can regard the given number as an allegory for a much longer period, etc.)Vincent Cassel makes a good Beast, especially before he gets turned into one; he remains a bit dangerous looking even after he returns to human form, but that presumably adds to his magnetism... Still, he does not quite rise to the level of Jean Marais in the older movie -- but any French person would say to that ""how could anyone?"" I do not envy Belle, however, as there is no evidence that the Beast, neither as Beast nor as human, has any sense of humor.. (But then, that is the case in most versions -- in the Disney version, you immediately regret the Beast when you meet his human conversion, who is clearly a major bore...)Lea Seydoux is outstanding as Belle, the best Belle I have seen among 5-6 versions. She's not a raving beauty, but she looks great in that role, as she did in Les Adieux a la Reine -- she looks like she grew up in these fancy dresses.
She's really good at mixing steely determination with vulnerability -- this Belle know exactly what she is doing and why, if not where it will lead her.Belle's father could be a bit better -- while suitably commercial (money clearly means much to him, at least until he loses Belle), he is rather colorless for someone who was supposed to have built a trading empire. The chief bandit is suitably sinister, especially when jovial. The other roles -- the three brothers, the two silly sisters, and the card-reading girlfriend of the head bandit, are fairly minor, but suitably cast.The director succumbed to a bit of whimsy by turning the hunting dogs (beagles) that accompanied the Beast when he was a prince much given to hunting into cute little dog-like creatures with very big eyes. (They turn back into beagles once the Beast turns back in to a man. It's a bit odd that the rather violent hunter who later becomes the Beast had beagles as hunting dogs -- he must have had a sense of whimsy himself, although it does not come out anywhere else in the movie. The beagles are in fact rather cuter than the cutesy creatures they turn into.) I did not care much for that part -- too Disneyish and seemed out of place in this movie -- but I am sure it will help young children sit through the more tense parts. After all, this is a movie intended for children (with suitable emotional support) as much as for adults -- as shown in the intro to the movie, where Belle reads her own tale to her young children, taking care to provide emotional support as needed.The movie could be improved by shortening the intro somewhat. While placed in the age of big sailing ships and horseriding, which makes for some nice early scenes, the intro takes a significant amount of time and will probably bore the kids, for whom financial ruin and moving to a house in the country will probably seem like a major improvement over the big fancy house in town ;-) This time could then have been added as one more day/night at the castle -- more time to enjoy the incredibly beautiful scenery and to gawk at one more incredibly gorgeous gown for Belle!Other than that, it's the perfect version of Beauty and the Beast."
" Worth seeing
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,7,"Watched the French version of Beauty and the Beast on Netflix. The film was less whimsical and far darker, but still an enjoyable adaptation of a classic. It reminded me of a Brothers Grimm dark and twisted fairy tail. Acting was all around well done and the production value was great. The film did have a few pacing issues near the end though. Overall a 7.5 out of 10."
" Stunning adaption
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,8,"The cinematography in this is absolutely incredible. The story is fantastic. I do wish there was more storyline on Belle falling in love so you are able to grasp that she has indeed fallen in love with a beast at the end. I like this version better than the Disney one. It's closer to the actual tale than Disney. 
Watch it, you won't be disappointed"
" YOUR NAILS NEED A MANI...!
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,7,"Reuniting w/his Brotherhood of the Wolf actor, Vincent Cassel, Christopher Gans gives us an update to Beauty & the Beast, jumping the current live action Disney release from earlier this year. Although no songs & talking kitchen aids are to be found in this version, we do have a full-bodied, CG entry that trumps the Disney release for pumping up the genuine menace & grandeur due to the story's Gothic touchstones. What Disney's version incorporates better is the precise through-line between Beauty & Beast making it obvious why these two fall in love w/each other. I would also recommend Cocteau's version from the 1940's for a take that is both flighty & sumptuously artful."
" Beautiful and worth a watch
",2017-10-04 00:00:00,10,"Is it perfect no, but it is worth the watch. I have repeatedly watched this movie just for some of the small details I may have missed the first time around. Contrary to most of the negative reviews the cgi is Not terrible and ssooooo obvious. Missing a bit of love story but you get the point. Closer to the original story than most of the remakes.Basically watch it once and judge it yourself."
" Sorry Disney!
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,10,"This film kicks the arse of anything Disney ever cleaned up, sanitized, recycled, re-churned and has fed us for years including the most recent fluff starring Emma Watson. They had us believing for years that Belle just up and went to that castle and fell in love with the Beast, yeah right! The fairy-tale belongs to the French people and they sure told their story right in this movie. I want this one in my collection. Oh! And the soundtrack's awesome too. A+"
" The French version of the famous fairy-tale.
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,7,"I should have seen this before the latest Disney version of the tale. It came a couple of years ago, with a wonderful cast and visuals. French cinema is not a great vfx powerhouse. Unlike most of the famous Hollywood mythical and fairy tales originated from Europe, it's rare to see them converted to films in the similar fashion in its homeland. One of the reasons was the international market, to earn back everything they have spent for it, and more. When such projects do happen, sometimes the filmmakers tie up with Hollywood co-production to secure returns. Even if you take this film's worldwide box office, nothing overwhelming. But the challenge they had taken was truly appreciable.That's not it, this is the most redesigned versions of them all I've seen so far. Because I haven't seen any other than Disney's, excluding the modern timeline adaptation like 'Beastly', 'I' et cetera. Yeah, even the Disney's live-action retained original from their animated version, but visually extraordinary. And in here, the story was same, thought told in a different way. The graphics too were very nice, I did not expect that. Despite it is being a fantasy and a children's tale, the contents were more serious. That reveals they were very keen to bring the adults to the screens than the kids. Yet nothing too seriously targeted the grownups like 'Tale of Tales'.Everyone knows the basic storyline of this tale. A recently lost their fortune, a family of six siblings with their father relocates to a small farmhouse. No one other than the youngest daughter, Belle, was happy to be in such nature surrounded place. But one day when her father got into a big trouble, she takes his position and becomes a prisoner in an abandoned castle. Since then she begins to learn about the mystery man of the castle, particularly his past, reason to be ended like that. And following, a twist in the narration leading to the finale, everyone's fate will be revealed.âRemember... A life for a rose.âThe film was two hours long and well filled with the scenes in it all over. It doesn't feel like we're watching a fantasy film. The colours, costumes, medieval story, misty mountain, all is the major reminder that you are watching a fairy-tale. Though you won't get anything magical from the story right away. Not until the third act. As for the story, from such vastly known tale, you can't expect any major surprise. As I said, some minor changes can be witnessed throughout. But such kind of scale the flick has in all the department, that too coming from Europe makes it a very special.Definitely no to comparison with the Disney's. Both of them were fine products on their own way. But people would compare and pick one when they are based on the same source. That can't be stopped. Disney had created their own brand, aiming for kids. You can find the people who liked both the live-actions. I never knew the original tale, I mean from the original source/text. Those who are familiar with are saying, this is most closest one. But something I did not understand was the Beast was cute furry Beast, just like Disney's. I anticipated something tough physique, hard character, I mean Beast as a real Beastly.Excluding that slight displeasure, I have had no other complaints with the film. I enjoyed it, yet there's another thing which is actually a question rather than a disagreement. The actors did their parts, though I felt the Beast character should have been played by a younger one. Vincent Cassel is a brilliant French actor and he did his best for it. Lea Seydoux as Beauty surely an excellent pick. The direction was good. Cautiously spent for everything in the film. So they have got a fine final product. Most of the people going for it, only keeping in mind Disney. You won't get that Disney's singing, dancing, overall appeal. One must clear off his mind from any great ideas and then only give it a try. Remember, it is not a very good film, but simply a good film.7/10"
" Another forgettable remake.
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,4,"The belle et la bÃªte is the French version of the classic musical animation of Disney Beauty and the Beast, I am not much fan of musical, but even I knowing that the French version would not be musical I was not excited, because the music of the animation was Excellent and missed a lot in this version, other things is lack of fidelity, the talking objects have not been exchanged for a strange animals, the actors do not look like their characters, especially Lea Seydoux who has nothing to do with Belle , And even Vincent Cassel is a great actor, he does not remember Beast, even if the makeup is good, director Christopher Gans can not get the actors' attention, and it's a good time for clichÃ©s, the photograph is very beautiful, there are moments With a very happy tone, the dialogues are medium, some are very uninteresting, the CGI is more or less, and the soundtrack is forgettable, La belle et la bÃªte is a remake of the classic animation very weak, with several problems of Scripts, poorly used actors and a median only direction. Note 4.0"
" It's Worth Seeing
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,6,"I have a number of fairy tale films I like seeing just because I'm busy sewing or something and need some motivation. I saw it on Netflix and didn't think I'd like it, but I found myself engaged. I won't go into the entire story because enough people have for those to get the gist of what's it about. I enjoyed the cinematography, the CGI wasn't as annoying as some people found it. This film definitely brings you the magic of an enchanted forest and castle. Again, if you like fairy tales that are a bit dark and enchanting and you need something to pass the time, then this film is for you.Now, what I didn't like was what everyone else found fault with. I didn't see how Belle could go from having such a horrible dislike for the Beast to loving him in the space of a day. There weren't enough scenes that showed a budding relationship between them and then with her getting flashes of his past to see what a jerk he'd been, that's definitely not to going to win him any points. It basically just comes down to a rich, magical dude using things instead of his personal qualities to get the girl.I'd wish Gans had stuck more to the original story where the Beast, in the book, had many conversations with Belle and his well treatment of her and the dreams would have been about the handsome prince (and I don't know why Cassel was cast for the role of the prince because he just didn't fit, which also could have affected the lack of dynamic between he and Seydoux, who I think did fine as Belle). I know he was probably trying to be more ""American"" by focusing on all the action, but I think too much time was spent on the dreams of the beast's backstory. Also, I would have liked to see more interaction between Belle and the puppy critters. She says they became her best friends but they never had any personal contact at all.However, if you just want to drown in the enchanting scenery and gorgeous costumes, you can forgive the cons."

" Translation is lacking
",2017-06-03 00:00:00,6,"Yes, the costuming and visual values are excellent. I watched this with the English dubbed in. Only Belle and the narrator make it work. It's too bad that my high school French is not good enough to let me watch it in the original French. I suspect that the actors would seem greatly improved. I do like how this version shows the father to be a self-centered coward. Even as a child it always bothered me that the father was willing to sacrifice his favorite child to save himself."
" So good
",2017-05-22 00:00:00,10,"This blew me away. I couldn't believe how much I loved it. I have attention deficit disorder and I actually sat and watched this without doing anything else, getting up, or looking away. That almost never happens and I cannot stress that enough. The film looks stunning and has high quality camera work and art direction. The costuming is incredible. The casting and acting is top notch (truly). But what I especially appreciate and what really stood out for me and tempted me to write a review was that this was not the same scripted tale of Beauty and the Beast we have been over saturated with by Disney. This is a new story and not predictable and much more adult even. Yes there is still that question of whether Belle is just suffering from the syndrome that kidnap victims can get for their captors but at least he is smart and when they bicker it's believable there is chemistry. I recommend this and trust me that it's not the same story over again, it is quite different."
" Way better than the 2017 musical thing Disney Made. Visually, ""tre belle!""
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,10,"Not going to write a long winded review. My wife and I had a look at the ""2017 Disney Emma Watson"" musical released recently, and it was rather terrible. I am not personally into broad way musical kind of stuff, and I could not stand it. This 2014 version the French made just jells a lot better for me. I can't speak more than 5 words French, but I loved this version of the story and how it unfolds. The graphics and cinematography was also excellent. Visually very stimulating. Well worth your time."
" Didn't feel like the characters developed properly
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,4,"The movie had some really strange moments. In my personal preference, I didn't like that Belle wasn't pure of heart. One of the first signs was when she first caught a glimpse of the Beast when he was standing behind her, her natural reaction was to grab a knife from the table and try to stab him.The next part I really didn't like was when she got angry that she couldn't see her family, she verbally wrecked the beast for not being a man, so much so to make him run away. After all of this, she witnesses him eating and runs in terror. He chases her down and pounces on her. After this sequence in which he both puts her life in danger by weakening the ice, than saves her. She is now in love with him... The family was annoying and not entertaining and I skipped Gaston almost completely. The only part of this movie that really caught me was the golden deer scene. That was a strong plot point, but not strong enough to save the empty relationship of Belle+Beast."
" A Visually Stunning film that will Blow you away
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,10,"When looking at movies I happened upon this one out of curiosity, and I am all the better for it. First, clear your mind of the Disney releases and story lines behind them. On many layers this masterful work will enchant you, from beginning to end. Disney should be put on notice, because the makers of this film made Disney look like amateurs. The sets, and costuming epitomize the true essence of what movie magic is all about, and will not disappoint you. Even the ending was wonderfully magical. The film score is awesome. Vincent Cassel, LÃ©a Seydoux, AndrÃ© Dussollier all should be recognized for their fantastic talents. The makers of this film have something to be truly proud of. This is a lavishly and visually stunning film, completely delightful, and worth watching a few more times to see what you may miss. The details are exquisite to behold. I can with certainty recommend this film to anyone, knowing they will agree."
