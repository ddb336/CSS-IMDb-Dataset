" Anti-Venezuelan
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,1,Anti-Venezuelan propaganda!!! This is just a dumb script movie with the sole intention of depicting Venezuela in a negative way.
" So so.
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,5,"The first 15 or 20 minutes are very good, until it gets to Venezuela... The rest of the film is comedy actioner by numbers: lazy script, little laughs, a bit of action, all a bit boring and predictable at times. The film is like a lazy, unimaginative rehash of ""Romancing the Stone"" with Douglas and DeVito, though of course that one was a much better movie. At least the tomb raider-like, ass kicking girl that helps the main character is excellent and pretty hot."
" A Good Movie That's Funny That Will Hold The Viewers Interest Throughout
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,9,"03/21/2021 For this off beat comic movie Kevin James was a good choice but his female book editor , actress Kelen Coleman was not. What the movie needed was as many female comedians as they could get in this movie. I just watched an excellent dead pan comedian Iliza Shlesinger that would have been excellent playing off of Kevin and would have made this movie much better. Another funny light hearted female comedian that does air head really well is Anna Kendrick. She does funny 24/7 on overload. Overall this was an enjoyable funny movie at times so I can definitely recommend watching it. Bon Appetit'"
" (Living) Fantasy
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,7,"Or daydreaming of sorts. A lot of people had dreams or fantasies like that. Being a hero, being a spy, fighting for a good cause and fighting against evil. And Kevin James or rather the character he portrays here has the same thing going on for him. And it really is fun to watch this. Having seen similar themed movies recently, I have to admit this was more than enjoyable.And the stunt work is really phenomenal - plus it does not take itself too serious. Some jokes may seem offensive to some, but overall you should not be too sensitive on things, because the mood and tone is overall the right one for this type of comedy. So action, jokes and tension from start to finish - what else do you want? Oh travel to other countries also check ..."
" It does what it says on the tin...
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,9,"It's a great action comedy which Kevin James pulls off belieivably very well with the athleticness and agility involved in some scenes. It's not a good look for the CIA - but then again, does any film make them look good!?
A good film to watch with the kids."
" No apologies
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,9,"Almost every review apologizes for the quality of the movie , but says they enjoyed it. I couldn't care less if critics, or Hollywood elites like this type of movie. It's entertainment. It's enjoyable, it's funny, it has a beautiful female agent, Kevin James is funny, and lots of cartoonish action. There is some gratuitous violence, so I wouldn't let anyone under 13 watch it.And it has more truth about what the CIA does in South America, than a lot of serious dramas."
" Clever writing, dialogue and jokes.
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,8,"The true star of this movie is the writing. Clever plot, clever dialogue and clever jokes. The acting is good (not great). And the action is good --- for a comedy movie.Zulay Henao is gorgeous.(I expect many reviewers are going to criticize this movie saying it was stupid and unrealistic. First of all, most action movies are. Secondly, it's a comedy. It's supposed to be stupid and unrealistic. That is one of the running jokes. It makes fun of action movies.)The music is good. But it's all top ten hits redone in Spanish. I didn't get that.This movie is good. Not great. Anybody giving this movie less than a 5, is just looking for something to complain about."
" Totally Could Happen...
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,5,"ðŸ˜‚ Ok so that was a flippant statement, as this film presents the most ridiculously far-fetched plot yet for a Kevin James movie. However, credit director Jeff Wadlow for re-writing and adapting the script to fit the Kevin James comedy style, and maintaining a non-stop pace in this action-comedy.Well-casted, this movie is non-stop action fun and always lets the audience know IT knows YOU know this is just for fun. It never attempts to act like it's more than what it is - a simple slap-stick/action farce with Kevin repeating his now pigeon holed character. It's worthy of no more than a 5/10, but still a fun (albeit mindless) flick to watch when in the mood for such. If you like Kevin James movies, no problem - it's a watch. If you don't, pass on it."
" When was it funny?
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,5,"The movie is supposed to be a comedy, right? Or at least action-comedy. The thing is, I literally laughed once for the whole movie. One time. When he said Bingo-vich. That was funny! The rest of the movie though... I don't know, maybe its just me but I didn't find any good humor in there..."
" Right up there
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,8,"Excellent movie, surprised that I hadn't seen this before. Had some funny moments, not a belly laugh production. Definitely recommended to watch."
" Fun assassin adventure
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,9,"I agree with the positive reviews, you'll Like this movie. It's a fun, writer in over his head movie, where make believe becomes real. Happy, silly, fun and entertaining."
" ""Still need a good signature line.""
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,7,"Well, it's got the word 'assassin' in the title, and since I've got an ongoing IMDb list that focuses on assassins, I thought I'd give this a try. The funny thing is, I don't think the main character in the movie ever killed anybody now that I think of it. That's because Samuel J. Larson (Kevin James) is an insurance actuary and would-be adventure novelist who's invented the fictional character Mason Carver. He's drawn into a Venezuelan coup attempt by virtue of a literary agent reinventing his persona from a fiction writer to a real life, globe spanning killer for hire.As insane as the whole idea sounds, this is generally a fun movie that keeps pace with it's action and humor. What's impressive are the fight scenes and martial art encounters involving actors Kevin James and Zulay Henao portraying DEA agent Rosa Bolivar. Those sequences seamlessly place their stunt doubles into the middle of the action without compromising someone like James, who's size and weight precludes an ability to fly through the air with the greatest of ease. I liked Bolivar in her role, fortunately the story line didn't try to make the most of a romantic entanglement between her character and partner Sam Larson.The story itself introduces a host of characters conspiring to do away with each other in the hotbed of Venezuelan drug trafficking, mercenaries for hire, and political corruption. The one liners come rapidly and take some of the edge off an entirely implausible story, so if you're up for something just a little bit different, this one might fill the bill for you. Kevin James fans should be particularly pleased."
" A lot better than you'd think
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,7,"I don't often laugh out loud at jokes in movies, but I did three times in this one. The story is silly, it could have done with a bit of tightening up here and there, but on the whole it's just enjoyable nonsense.A solid seven stars."
" Paul Blart: Fake Assassin
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,5,"Decent watch at best, not likely to watch again, and can't recommend.The premise isn't very strong to begin with, though it and the movie have its humorous notes. The biggest problem with this is that Adam Sandler (a notable friend of Kevin James) did a movie similar to this (The Do Over) a year later and it was barely believable with someone relatively fit. Now that's a consistent joke, in Kevin James' career as well as this movie, that he's a big guy and doesn't look like he could be an assassin, but it doesn't pay off in the joke or the message.At least in ""You Don't Mess With the Zohan"" which preceded this, the joke was that he was so ridiculous he could barely be real. This is almost the opposite of that: ""how incompetent can we make him and he not die""? And it still took quite a bit of plot armor and comedy writing to save him.I think that's the real problem with this: it's not funny enough to just be a comedy, but it's not action enough to just be an action movie. The way it is, as well produced as it is, it must be an action comedy, and it's just not strong enough in either category. Zulay Henao carried most of the real action, and having 3 (4 if you count the CIA) different protagonists pulled focus away from Sam far too much. This is especially true when the beginning of the movie so establishes it as his movie that they even shot his idle thoughts during his writing process.There are just so many other things to watch, and if you're in a Kevin James mood, watch ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop"" (the original, not the sequel), at least that's funny and clever.And if you're in a normal guy action movie, ""The Do Over"" is okay, and ""The Secret Life of Walter Mitty"" is actually pretty amazing."
" Liked it a lot
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,8,"It good twist to the usual spy films, with humour too!"
" Kevin James
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,7,"Very good & enjoyable movie, concept is very funny. There is no dull moment in there to point out."
" A movie with an interesting idea, that ends up to be the usual comedy with the usual jokes
",2020-01-14 00:00:00,4,"I found this movie randomly while I was exploring the Netflix catalogue. The title captured my attention, and the trailer definitely pushed me to watch it. The premises are good: an aspiring writer is going to complete his first book, about an international assassin. His story will be published, but they will change the title and the editorial will categorize the book as nonfiction, claiming that the story is real. The author will find himself involved in a conspiracy to kill the president of Venezuela because of the publishing.Action sequences are surprisingly good, considering that this is a simple comedy and the editing is very dynamic, for sure from a technical perspective there is nothing much to say: it is well made. At the beginning there are funny scenes and I have found the story really catchy. In the middle section the movie starts to be too much repetitive, jokes and comedic situations are always the same and what seemed to be something refreshing, becomes boring and stagnant. Kevin James does his best, his performance along the movie is valid, even if there a few moments in which is not really great. In general cast did a pretty decent job, even if there were some important characters such as Juan or General Ruiz that were really annoying, because completely cliche, even for a comedy of this kind.I understand that this movie wants just to make you smile, and does not want to be at all a masterpiece, however I was expecting a little bit more, since the trailer was so well done. The beginning and the ending of the movie are just okay, but the middle section is boring (including actions scenes)."
" A true comic niche
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,9,"From King of Queens to this current movie, Kevin has come a long ways. Not that I cared much for his Mall Cop movies, but with this movie, Kevin James has definitely carved out a unique comic niche for himself."
" Cuckoo, but fun...
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,8,"Putting all Times New Roman aside because I suppose some publishers do accept it... I mean, if you want to see a movie get made, it shouldn't be about a writer, right? Or a rockstar? Because these movies never get made?People will comment on the subject matter, probably, or have, but I haven't read their (not they're) reviews. I do have to say it's totally unrealistic that he just used ""The Ghost"" in his book even though he was told not to. I mean, every self respecting author would have introduced the phrase ""Call me the Thesaurus,"" right?It does have action, and jokes, and more writer jokes, that even people that aren't writers will get, but hey, yes, they are good writer jokes. And I really enjoyed watching it. First he gets abducted to be forced to assassinate someone or the other guy? Or why not just everyone?It's too weird to write a normal review. It doesn't make me question anything. It was just fun. Yeah, I say Kevin James IS fun. Always has been probably. Maybe some screenplays really suck? Why do they always blame it on the actors?Why is he SO LIKABLE? I don't know. I feel it's more like he (not he's, see that, slang right there) likEable, with an E. Signing off, over and out, and hitting enter."
" Way funnier than I thought
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,7,"I saw this with my family because we are Venezuelans and we thought let's see what this is about, and I was sure it was going to suck. But I was so wrong, this was really funny, but I think it was extra funny for me because I am from Caracas and I could see everything was so fake that made me laugh, besides I felt very close to the main plot... they are trying to kill the president, that is our collective dream. I also enjoyed the acting of most of the characters specially Andy Garcia was the best! So if you are bored and want to see something light you can watch this"
" I came in with low expectations but....
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,8,"I was pleasantly surprised. I'm not a big fan of these types of movies but the characters were great, the action was above par for an action comedy, the comedic time of the jokes was great and I think they did a great jobs with the casting.The reason I waited so long to watch this is because I thought Kevin James couldn't pull off an action comedy like this but he did a stellar job. Definitely worth watching"
" Just saw this on Netflix - Saturday 28th September
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,10,"Not a high Kevin James fan yet found myself thoroughly enjoying this ""True"" Story action packed comedy.Well thought out and written fun movie which kept me on the edge of my seatWell timed comedy with no flat line jokesGreat movie. Mr. James should do more movies like this and stay away from Mall Cop etc scripts Perhaps a sequel?"
" Confusing, Lacklustre and boring
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,3,"Ok, I almost fell asleep watching and hay 3 out of 10 best Kevin James movie ever."
" It's fun
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,8,"Sometimes you watch a movie just to have fun and kill time. This is the movie that does that. Funny, cute actress, great twist and fun plot. It's not a movie to win an Oscar so stop being negative about not liking it. Sometimes you go outside and play basketball not to win and dominate your neighbor. You go outside to have fun and shoot hoops. This movie is like that. You watch it to have fun. Eat some popcorn, have a laugh, feel some suspense etc. it entertains."
" Amazing
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,10,This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Kevin James deserves an Oscar for this amazing performance. Lots of laughs and great action. Would recommend to everyone. SEE THIS MOVIE.
" It's funny
",2019-07-17 00:00:00,7,It's a funny movie. It's not art but it wasn't meant to be.
" Dumb fun, but still fun
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,8,"Take The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, dumb it down to a Paul Blart level, add some fireworks and you get this movie. Apart from a few illogical moments and some femi-lines thrown in for the... you know who, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It's just what it takes for a fun, laid back movie night. Kevin James funny as always, and the ""tough lady"" partner was an obvious, but welcome choice."
" Not half bad
",2019-06-07 00:00:00,7,Surprised by the low ratings on here. I guess Sheep do what sheep do best without an independent thought.This film is no Oscar contender but it's pretty entertaining and interesting. I thought it would be some cheesy film where the main guy turns out to be some super hero by the end and gets the girl but that didn't happen. We were often reminded that Kevin James was in over his head and while he adapted he still often fell flat on his face in comedic fashion. Quite an interesting adventure in Venezuela and overall kinda decent.7.5/10
" Kevin James with another Family Fun Flick
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,5,"In an era of a lot of garbage TV this is a breath of fresh air in that regard. It's a family friendly mindless movie. Runtime of 98 minutes makes it attainable for a mid week movie for those of you who work.As for the movie itself Kevin James is pretty good quality, not his best but better than his Mall Cop movies. The whole movies teeters on a comedy and fun action movie. Original screenplay is a plus and the plot is good! If it was any longer than an hour and a half I would have probably turned it off.I recommend the movie under the 'Family mindless movie night' category. It's got just enough humor and action to make this watchable"
" B movie nonsense
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,4,It's just about watchable and fast paced which makes it bearable but there are just no real laughs and a cheap tacky feel to the whole thing. Just about ok to watch whilst doing something else in the background but that's about it.
" Something I liked James in but the movie sucks
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,4,A pretty basic spy movie but was surprised that Kevin James actually did a good job acting in this one and was more out of the usual. Hopefully he becomes a better actor over time and does not resort to the usual stuff in future movies. this film had alot of promise but its not enough skip this one and watch the incredibles or a james bond film
" A Not So Dumb Spy Hero Action Comedy
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,8,"12 November 2016. It took a while, but either actor Kevin James, director Jeff Wadlow, or screenwriter Jeff Morris or all of them together were able to produce a not so dumb spy hero comedy. Traditionally of late, dumb heroes have been presented as clumsy and truly mentally challenged. Yet in the beginning, it required a lot of talent, intelligence, and finesse to truly pull it off, as Charlie Chaplin as The Great Dictator (1940) or Peter Sellers as Inspector Jacques Clouseau in The Pink Panther (1963). Now usually our comedic heroes have become bumbling fools and lazy copy-kinds of the pratfall junk humor without intelligence as even Kevin James found himself in Paul Blart: Mall Cop (2009) or Owen Wilson in Shanghai Noon (2000). It took director James Carpenter with actor Kurt Russell to successfully replicate a decent not so dumb hero who was actual pretty narcissistically blind about its own failure in the comedy adventure Big Trouble in Little China (1986). Instead in Memoirs, the audience is immediately presented with an opening scene with action-packed James Bond themed physical combat accompanied with its own version of Bond's energetic musical pulsating melody. Building upon the more over the top writer fantasy comedy of John Candy's performance in Delirious (1991), Memoirs captures a much more competent but innocent civilian with a case of mistaken identity which requires our, hero, Same Larson becoming super spy Mason Carver played by Kevin James. Memoirs accomplishes in its fine balance between humor and serious action and intrigue offering its audience the thrill of laughter and suspense, like a delicious sweet and sour Chinese dish."
" Totally un related from Venezuela's reality
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,2,"Im Venezuelan and this story is completely absurd and un related from Venezuela's landscapes, geography even characters spanish accent. I think is mexican or something. Totally offensive they definitely didn't research about a bit of history of Venezuela"
" Totally enjoyed it
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,10,"If you're tired of typical movies, watch this. Was totally worth my time."
" Amazing
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,10,Amazing simply amazing! Sandler and Kevin James are a tour de force in this international spy saga. Bravo!
" WASTE OF TIME
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,1,"STOP GIVING KEVIN JAMES HIS OWN MOVIES, HE'S TERRIBLE AND WASTES FILM AND THE VIEWERS TIME"
" Make a follow up Netflix
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,9,Come on People this is a silly movie with a funny lead and could have been made in to a trilogy at least my opinion is Netflix should make more keep Kevin and zulay as leads and build something round it.
" The Ghost...!
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,10,I really enjoyed it... All Kevin's movies are hilarious. Fantastic!!!
" Too expected and unreal
",2018-08-14 00:00:00,4,"It's basically true memoirs of a lÃµco writer.
Its a movie for a family night, but certainly not a movie to watch with someone older than 12"
" It's simply not funny
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,3,"This movie isn't the first attempt to use the plot of a totally inexperienced civilian getting pushed into the cutthroat world of international espionage, to put it mildly. But I think it could have worked again with enough effort by the writers and the director to push it up several notches than usual. Sadly, there is very little spark to be found here. I will admit that Kevin James is appealing and likable, but even he seems unable to wring any laughs out of the sorry script. The movie simply isn't funny at all, one reason being that the energy level is usually very low. The only time when there is more energy is with the action sequences, but they backfire on the movie by being excessively brutal and bloody for what is supposed to be a comedy. Things aren't help by a somewhat limited budget, which gives most of the movie a look and feel of what you would expect from an American prime time drama. The end results could have been worse - the movie is never aggressively bad enough to irritate or anger the viewer - but the execution all the same is so lame that the movie still ends up being a complete waste of time."
" Funny comedy
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,9,"I could not believe when I saw the 5.9 score. This is a definitely way better than that: funny, full of action with actually an innovative plot. I would certainly recommend it!"
" The Professional Critics are Idiots
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed the entire movie. It has nice pacing, the humor is well done, the story is engaging and when you knock of off any thought of academy awards, this is well worth watching. I am sort of hoping they can fashion a sequel. I enjoy light comedy. I enjoy high drama. I enjoy art films. I enjoy them for what they are. This is action and light comedy. Once you understand that, this is fun."
" A good timepass movie and dome really good acting
",2018-04-08 00:00:00,8,"The movie has a crisp story & editing, and is good popcorn movie. Liked the acting & comedy as well."
" I won't waste many words on this...
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,3,"The ""International Assassin"" of the title is actually an aspiring writer of pulp fiction, who is mistaken for his intrepid alter-ego by South American rebels. It's an engaging, if not very original premise. After a fairly clever opening sequence, the plot accelerates, and before long runs right off the rails, and plows into Stupidville, with a series of improbable comic escapades...minus the laughs. I'll give ""True Memoirs of an International Assassin"" a couple of points for jungle scenery, a few low level chuckles, and the appealing Zulay Henao as a kick-ass female freedom fighter. I didn't have high expectations for this straight to Netflix offering, but even in the crowded field of mindless brain fodder, this one's a dud."
" Entertaining throwaway action/comedy with Kevin James & Zulay Henao
",2017-12-14 00:00:00,6,"RELEASED IN 1970 and directed by Jeff Wadlow, ""True Memoirs of an International Assassin"" details events when an unpublished American author's spy novel is changed by his new publisher from fiction to non-fiction, thus thrusting the homebody author (Kevin James) into the thrilling, life-or-death world of his fictional protagonist in the most dangerous city on Earth: Caracas, Venezuela. Zulay Henao plays the Latino babe he teams-up with there. Kim Coates, Maurice Compte, Andrew Howard and Andy Garcia appear as other characters the writer meets in South America.If you like Kevin James, this is an action-packed comedy highlighted on the female front by Zulay, Emilie Ullerup and others (e.g. Katie Couric). It's too incidental to give a higher grade, but it's snappy and thrilling for what it is. I enjoyed the stereotypical depiction of a filthy rich drug lord, basically living like Hugh Hefner in a vast mansion with half-naked women frolicking about the pool.THE FILM RUNS 98 minutes and was shot in New York City, Atlanta & Dominican Republic. WRITERS: Jeff Morris & Wadlow.GRADE: B-"
" Fun, but Could Use some more Substance
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,6,"This movie had a solid idea, some solid acting, and a good story. The acting is OK, and the direction is good enough, but overall, it's nothing great. It all just comes together in a rather predictable movie, albeit a fun one. I found it to be entertaining enough, though I would've enjoyed it more had this movie had some better writing. A lot of the jokes didn't seem to land the way they seemed to be intended for, and the pacing could definitely use some work.Overall, this movie is entertaining, but not meant to be watched with active thinking. Maybe some good background noise, or if you need to kill a couple of hours, but not something I'm likely to go back to watch."
" Funny is not the word bu "" The Ghost"" is the word.
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,7,"For a while as the movie started and proceeded for 15 minutes I thought it was not going to pick up speed. Then i got into the groove and started imagining like my hero. I am familiar with his moves since I like to do the same. I an sure there are lot like me as well. Then came the real part when he is called out for an assignment. Some of it reminded me it was a movie because the impossible were happening but in a humorous way. I was able to settled with that score. As the movie proceeded I thought he will fall in love with the chick but he was a true professional to the core. He knew what was to happen next and so he was well prepared like Sherlock Holmes. He is honest, humble and simple and that was what attracted the war lords. Mysteriously he was always saved at the last second. That was awesome direction by the director. I guess the hero knows it since it is his book of action. Audience like me were momentarily worried about our hero's safety. The female operative is stunning and her good looks did not seem to mesmerize our hero. I must say it was a fun filling movie and quite relaxing . I give it a 7"
" Not a moment wasted.
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Full disclosure: In my frank opinion, these types of Sandleresque films as a whole get scored way too low. They do not aim high, but usually hit the mark quite accurately.This film is, simply put, fun. There was not a moment where I got bored or thought about switching to something else. When judging films one must consider the films intentions. of course this isn't Schindler's List or LotR: Return of the king, but what it aims to do, it does wonderfully. While I was watching this film there was not a moment where I thought 'This is boring' or 'I want to switch to something else'.If you want a lighthearted, yet action packed comedy/action movie, this one fits there perfectly."
