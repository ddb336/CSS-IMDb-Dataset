" Gratuitous violence and wokeness spoiling a potentially interesting idea.
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,1,"This is an awful movie. It has meaningless violence, we get the new math wokeness of 1+1 not equal to 2 and even the sentimental Lucy meeting old Lucy with the Elliot - E. T. finger greeting. The idea of exploring the greater potential of the human brain might interesting, but this movie completely corrupts that idea."
" Significant
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,9,"Seldom post on here. There exist only five movies I can watch over and over again, North by North West, Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Big Lebowski, Dazed and Confused and this. Lucy is ultimately the movie that Limitless, with it's all star cast wanted to be, but alas fell short.
Poignant and incredibly clever, a disturbingly accurate reflection of a twenty-first century existence. Call it what you like, Sci-fi, drama, fantasy; bottom line it's art and quite philosophical.
I don't like much but I loved this, Scarlett Johansson as an actor in my humble opinion is as good as it gets. She nails this role."
" If you understood this. I swear life would be easier
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,10,"""Life was given to us a billion years ago. Now you know what to do with it."".
The writer of this movie is genius, I don't give a **** about anyone talking bad about this movie.
It's completely amazing& perfect , I can't say how many times I've seen it but maybe in the third time I've understood it 100% and I am so happy that i did.
""YOU ONLY PASS ON IN LIFE, THAT'S OUR PURPOSE."".
I recommended that you re watch it if you didn't understand this movie. Even a couple times that's fine.
Anyway they are not going to make a sequel and I'm sad :("
" Great concept and idea of a movie
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,10,"Compelling and edge of the seat entertaining. Well executed, delivered and acted. I can't see the flaws in this one. She is an incredible actress and so is Morgan in this film. Very thought provoking with our potential ability's."
" Missed opportunities
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,6,"Brilliant first half, lousy second. Too much focus on the bad guys. And the bad guys weren't given a credible incentive to take it as far as they did.*** Spoilers ***Lucy's powers were just way over the top. Telekinesis, psychic knowledge, et cetera. Lost me there. Like someone else here said: the human (or Luc Besson's) mind isn't capable of thinking up what someone would be like when using let's say 60% of his or her brain capacity.And the bunch of bad guys walking in on bunch of cops in a hospital and shooting everyone? That's just silly and unbelievable. Even if the bad guys would survive this there'd be cameras everywhere. Basically a suicide mission, and why? A good script doctor might've at least given them a (better) reason.And then that last shootout with the scientists, well, pfff, Lucy having all those powers, wouldn't she take care of the criminals first before going on that 100% brain capacity metaphysical travel?
A lot of it just makes no sense, and when things make no sense I tune out.I thought the (visuals of the) time travel was cool though.
And I liked Lucy's last message about her whereabouts."
" Wish I could control time too...
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,1,...so I can get this time of my life back and decide never to watch that film. Stupid.
" I know about ""suspension of belief"" but damn...
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,3,"This was embarrassingly implausible. No stakes, no risks, even Superman was likable and vulnerable. If they developed the Lucy in the beginning of the movie that would have been more interesting than the weird robot she became. This was laughably bad. Why did a supposedly talented director and supposedly talented actor agree to partake in th...oh, the plausibly large checks."
" Good production quality. Cringe-worthy script. Every line of 'science', not just the 10% thing, was backwards.
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,1,"'The 10% myth isn't true, but if you can just roll with this one thing, the rest of the film is interesting and watchable' is something you can say about Limitless, but not this drivel. Everything was fine about this film, the acting, the music, the cinematography, the pacing, the cgi, all excellent, except the script, which was garbage. Even the plot was basically okay, although quite predictable. the general premise, though far-fetched, wasn't what ruined this. Every sentence of 'science' was a mashed up jumble of science buzz words. Every one. Science word spaghetti. Any coherent sentence communicated fundamental misunderstanding of the basics of what things are and how they work. The one thing this film got right was this - 'Ignorance brings chaos, not knowledge'. And this film is full of ignorance."
" Pay No Mind to the Poor Reviews
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,10,"Those who were disappointed with this movie were expecting the typical Super Hero happy ending. In truth, you must be one to appreciate the journey rather than reaching the destination. To be honest, I had second thoughts because of the poor reviews... I'm so glad I took the risk of purchasing this incredible movie. It is very much worth every penny.Luc Besson obviously has a brilliant mind to, so far, be the only director I've known to convey such a philosophy I very often thought about (and still often do today). I only wish my Father was still around to share this ""thought provoking"" 90 minutes with me. We'd have had so much to talk about after watching this.It did seem poorly initiated at first. Clearly they struggled to decide how to get to the point where what matters most. Certain scenes and delivery will make you smirk and chuckle, but really, there's no need to write off the quality of the message or disregard the entire package because of those little things.Are you a deep thinker and wonder if you might or might not enjoy this movie? I say go for it!"
" Just no
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,2,The fact I managed to watch this entire movie is a testament to my strength and will of character.
" Wonky acting and horrible dialogue.
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,3,"I'm not here to talk about the science behind the movie because it's a movie, it's fantasy. What I have a problem with is the terrible dialogue and the really poor acting. The CGI is glaring and obvious and the action scenes look ridiculous."
" Lucy
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,8,"Lucy is asked by her one-week boyfriend named Richard to deliver a mysterious case to Mr. Jang in the hotel lobby. Richard chains Lucy to the case so she has to get it unlocked by Jang. She goes in and asks the front desk for Jang.Richard gets shot outside the hotel and Lucy is surrounded by men in suits. She is escorted to a room. Lucy can see bloody ankles and feet and gags. She is forced to sit in a chair. Men who speak Korean and Mandarin surround her. She is ordered to open the case and it turns out to be pouches of a new drug that is blue in colour.Lucy is slapped and wakes up in a hotel room shirtless with only her black lace bra. She looks down and sees a wound near her hip. A man comes in and throws clothes at her to wear.Lucy is chained alone in another room. Two Chinese men are with her and say in Mandarin she is beautiful. The taller man touches her cleavage and Lucy says she is not in the mood. The man slaps then kicks Lucy, breaking open the stitches and also the bag. The drug absorbs into her body. Lucy has all this new energy.Another man comes in and Lucy spreads her legs invitingly. The man begins to take off his belt and unzip his pants. Lucy uses the belt to her advantage and manages to get a gun.With her new abilities Lucy calls in an international drug number. She informs him of individuals with drugs who will be going to Berlin, etc.Throughout this movie Morgan Freeman and Lucy narrate about cells, existence, time. They show animals having sex to reproduce and a couple doing it in their trunk.In the end Lucy and the investigator have a flirtatious moment. Lucy kisses him. They meet Morgan Freeman and other experts. Lucy is given the rest of the substance that are usually only found in pregnant women whose bodies create it for the fetus. Lucy provides all her knowledge into a computer and her body dissolves. The investigator asks the experts where she is. He receives a message on his phone from Lucy that she is everywhere."
" Watching this movie for the first time in 2021. I have no words other than: BEAUTIFUL
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,10,"First of all, thank you Ralph Smart for recommending this movie to me in one of your videos! :DI couldn't sleep at night so I decided to watch a movie and I am greatly satisfied with this one!I was wondering what the score on IMDb was, and shockingly it only has a score of 6.4.I believe this movie deserves a better score than that, and that is why I am voting 10/10.If you haven't watched this movie yet, please watch it! It is really worth it. :)"
" Interesting story and enjoyable movie, for the most parts...
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,6,"I was initially recommended to sit down to watch ""Lucy"" back in 2014, but I skipped on the movie as I am not a fan of Scarlett Johansson. Then in 2021 another friend recommended the movie to me, so I figured there might be something to it, and I sat down to watch the movie.I didn't know that it was a movie written and directed by none other than Luc Besson. And that alone pretty much guarantees some sort of entertainment.And yeah, Luc Besson does deliver with the 2014 movie ""Lucy"". I will say that it was definitely a surprise of a movie, and I was thoroughly entertained by what the storyline turned out to be.Well, that goes for the majority of the movie. It was a great action ride that gives you something to actually think about. But then Lucy reached 70% brain capacity and the movie just crumbled underneath itself. At that point the movie went from being really interesting and captivating, to just becoming downright ludicrous and laughable. Everything that writer and director Luc Besson had established and built throughout the course of the movie crashed hard as Lucy progressed from 70% to 100%. Now, I will not give away what happened here, but it was definitely a slap to the face of the viewers with a cold, dead fish.Visually then ""Lucy"" was a pretty astounding movie. The visual effects department definitely knew what they were doing, and the effects were gradually layered onto the movie as Lucy's brain capacity increased. And it worked well in favor of the movie.""Lucy"" has a pretty good cast ensemble. Now, I am not overly keen on Scarlett Johansson's acting talent, but she actually was nicely cast for this movie and performed quite well. Needless to say that Morgan Freeman delivered his usual spot on performances here. I found it a very interesting, but really great, choice that they hired Choi Min-sik for the movie, because he is such a mammoth actor and really brings something unique with him, so he was a marvelous addition to the cast list.I will say that I thoroughly enjoyed the movie right up to the 70% brain capacity marker, then it was just crumbling to pieces. Had writer and director Luc Besson opted for something else, the movie would have fared better. My rating of ""Lucy"" lands on a six out of ten stars, and it was that last 30% of the progress that dragged the movie down."
" Loved it
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,8,"This movie requires a sequel. The concept, its execution, the line up of actors - well done. I hope the studio decides to expand on this movie. I watched it for the 2nd time and I regretted not sharing my thoughts sooner. It may have prompted a sequel."
" It's ok. Nothing spesh
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,6,"I haven't seen a Luc Besson film in a while. Probably not since Leon. Since my memories of that were good I thought I'd give this a go.It's ok if A bit humourless as Scarlett goes on a Jason Bourne-meets-John Wick kill-crazy rampage. Her robotic delivery, No doubt brought on by her super brain reaching never-experienced-before heights, becomes a bit tiresome after a while.It's a basic shoot em up with Little character development But lots Of neat action mixed with a bit of movie-science that grounds This superhero. It's ok but nothing spesh."
" 6
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,6,"Good movie, I was expected something else but I can't complain about what was given. The plot was interesting, I would even say maybe something new. The doctor/professor scenes didn't make it better so I would even say it could be better without them, only movie about Lucy and her abilities. I would recommend to watch this movie for fantasy and action lovers."
" Could've been a really good movie
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,4,"Okay, so basically this could've been a great movie and some scenes were dope. The whole movie is badass and it has very original moments. There are many things that I do not understand tho.1. How did she manage to get all these powers?
If the drug made her get the powers, why did nobody else get them? There were like at least 3 people with the drug in them and they were just kinda living their own lifes? I do not understand. Am I dumb?
2. The drug - how did she get it on the plane?
Ok so I know this is a movie but how did she get the blue drug on the plane? Am I missing something?
3. The ending
It is horrible. Seems like they just ran out of ideas and added all of the ideas into the ending to make it look like the movie has more budget than it really does. I don't know what else they could've put in it. The movie is basically about a woman who has every single power that we as people do not normally have. She dies when she reaches 100% of her brain knowledge. They could've used a different ending than just transitions and then poof - she disappears but also is somehow everywhere? Makes no sense to me.Overall I really liked the special effects. The idea is not the best but the whole Chinese mafia gang adds it's own originality into the movie and actually makes some type of storyline instead of just a woman magically getting super powers."
" [9.1] The human brain is infinity
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,9,"Lucy, the movie that opened my eyes to the limitless power of the human brain.The movie that made me gasp in awe time and time again and overheated my 11% brain cells.The movie that showed me how ignorant I was before.And the movie that makes me keep waiting with utmost impatience and anticipation for Lucy 2, as soon as I discovered that it was in development.Once more, a magnificent production from Luc Besson, who's a genius in creating simple action flicks with deep messages."
" Beyond imagination
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,10,"Loved this film, just makes you wonder how much of our brain we do not use. Packed with action, Science fiction or not a great film to watch."
" Greetings from Moscow
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,10,"Yesterday she was just a sexy blonde, and today - the most dangerous and deadly creature on the planet with supernatural abilities and intelligence. What had recently been considered a fantastic theory by the best minds in the world had become a reality for her. And now she will turn from a prey to a huntress. Her name is Lucy."
" The impossible reality of it.
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,10,"I have no idea why people are so mixed on this film.
I LOVED it.
Scientifically it's not accurate but the possibilities of imagining that it is? That's in the mind of the beholder.This is SCI-FI and the aim is to make you imagine the unimaginable. If you have no imagination then don't bother watching it.
From start to finish, the acting, the roll out and the delivery was so entertaining that it actually makes you wonder 'but what if'.If you're watching this for factual information, you need to find another film because this ain't it.If you want a film with lots of action, Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman and the freedom to explore Luc Beesons work- stop and give it a go."
" 3 stars for Taipei
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,3,Taipei looked pretty. Thats it. This film was terrible.
" It's not good is it.
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,4,"Scarlett is as expected brilliant but the role she have been given to play doesnt do her capabilities as an actress any favours. The movie starts of interesting and appears to have been brought to life from an actual good ide, it is however not more than 15 minutes before it loses its plot and becomes a run of the mill science fiction/action flick.I would love to see this idea toned down and remade to be less out there, for one that would open up the actress/actors possibility to actually act, secondly it would bring more people along on the trip seeing that the enhanced ""features"" gained would be something that obeys the law of physics..Conclusion: not a movie you watch twice if you value your time."
" A Nonstop Mind-Bending Sci-Fi Action Flick from Luc Besson
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,7,"When this movie first came out, I shied away from it because the previews telegraphed that it might be derivative and predictable. It was neither.Author/Director Luc Besson (The Fifth Element, Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets) has once again used his command of imagery to literally show us an entire universe full of profound meanings normally hidden from us. The title character ingests a drug that allows her to fully utilize the brain that we ordinarily use only 10% of. Scarlett Johansson transforms from a directionless ne'er-do-well victimized by life into a focused, unstoppable woman on a mission.It's a wild, nonstop ride. To enjoy the film, you really have to suspend belief for its runtime and accept the basic premises of his story. After lots of bloody gunplay, some borderline preposterous pseudoscience courtesy of Morgan Freeman, and one of the best car chase scenes ever, we arrive at a totally surprising conclusion. Besson's provocative ideas about what humans might do with maximum brainpower are fun to watch even if they are sometimes absurd. Visual effects from ILM and major Québec firm Rodeo FX ensure that the mind-bending finale takes you to places you've never seen before.No major award nominations or wins for this one. Although I deeply admire Besson's style, this is more a summer action flick than truly great cinema. Recommended nonetheless."
" Lucy
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,6,"Lucy is an ambitious sci-fi extravaganza, to say the least. Despite its ambition, for some odd reason, it settled on a mere 90-minute runtime. While I often tend to be a fan of short straight-to-the-point films, here, the short duration is only damaging. As such, the resulting film often feels unfocused and rushed.That isn't to say that there aren't good things in it as well. Indeed, there are quite a few of them. First of all, the concept in Lucy is great. I was all aboard with the idea of exploring how powerful the human brain might be, assuming we were able to access all of its capabilities. And while that concept and everything it brought with was one of the better parts of this film, the way it's was explored and brought to the silver screen, was one the worst. There are so many ideas and so many concepts that it tries to fit into one concise film, that no matter how long the run time would've been, I doubt it could've ever made much sense. And although I do admire the insanity that it tries to control and manage, I can't help but feel that there never was an intention to make a film that would've captured it all in a reasonable manner. However, despite an apparent struggle to contain and showcase all of these ideas, they do create a rather interesting overall product.Now, while there is a lot to like conceptually, there are also some fairly odd choices. They are thankfully apparent mostly in the beginning and slowly start to fade away as the film kicks into gear. One example, out of the many, could be the use of weird parallelisms and metaphors to help the viewer along. Early on, as Lucy, the main character, has to enter an ominous building, the film quickly transitions into a shot of a mouse entering a mousetrap. It goes without saying that Lucy is supposed to be the mouse and the building the mousetrap. Since that much is obvious without a metaphorical example from the animal kingdom, it begs the question, why was it there in the first place, and why were there others like it later? One theory, and this one of my own making, is that we humans are nothing more than animals. Not the most creative, I know, but bear with me for a second. A big part of the film and what it most adamantly tries to say is that we, humans, are trapped by our own constructs. That we would indeed be just like animals, had we not created the rules and laws that govern our lives. That idea, then, opens up the seemingly endless possibilities that could be unlocked with using our brains to their fullest capacity. Could we, potentially, control all matter and thought? Could we, even, travel through time, unbound by the laws of nature? The movie clearly thinks so. And in its attempt to make us think so as well, it paints a picture of the two different beings using those aforementioned metaphors. Animals and humans on the one hand and humans that are no longer trapped by the limits of their brains, on the other hand.As I said, it's a great concept. And although I wasn't a big fan of the heavily used parallelisms, they certainly got the point across. However, the biggest problem wasn't the concept or how it was delivered. What made Lucy difficult to watch, at times, was the clear lack of focus. That concept alone could've easily been made into a movie of its own, and it would've probably been longer than what we have here. But despite its constraining length, Lucy tries to do so much more. At the same time as it's exploring human nature and the deepest questions of our existence, it also tries to create a John Wick-esque action thriller. As a result, both parts suffer. Either this movie should've been twice as long, or it should've focused on being one thing. I think it could've been a great action thriller with the elements of revenge it had built into it. I also think it could've been a great sci-fi film had it only focused on exploring the concept it so heavily relies on. However, trying to combine the two, especially in the way it was done, created a lacklustre result that failed to make me care.But at the end of the day, despite its problems, which there are many of, there is a good amount to like here. As it explores the concept and all the possibilities that might come with unlocking our brains, it creates a visually stunning experience. And the action is also quite fun. And had it not been for the overabundance of ideas that were attempted to be included, Lucy could've been a great film. As it stands, though, it ultimately failed to make an impact on me, despite dealing with such an interesting idea."
" I don't what it was.
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,7,"I actually decided to watch this movie because of it's less time duration and also to see the power of human brain. The movie started very interesting and engaging but after sometime it started to become, I don't know........ a horror movie. I am not commenting on the Science logic or story line of the movie, they were OK with some obvious loopholes and some senseless scenes. But I actually felt it had many similarities to a general horror movie in many scenes."
" Tried to do too much resulting in flat story
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,5,"They wanted to do too much in one movie resulting in an action packed mumbo jumbo. The film borrows from every action movie (Venom, X-men, Inception, Mission Impossible and Old Boy) but these elements felt like afterthoughts put in the film with the purpose of making it more blockbuster. The end result is a lot of scientific chatters, flat characters, pointless conflicts, unnecessary action sequences and cliched plot elements.Let's take a look at some of these:Why did Lucy ends up in a Chinese hideout dungeon while the other three guys goes to airport in Europe? Oh because they can do a cool Inception spinning room scene.Why did Lucy, who could essentially control anything, have to drive erratically through Paris creating multiple car crashes? Oh, because then they can have an awesome car chase scene.What happened to Lucy's empathy and compassion? Oh, because then we can have a hot gun flinging assassin bent on revenge.Why's the point of Morgan Freeman's character other than exposition? Oh because someone needs to explain what's happening as Lucy goes on her rampage.Why did we have a French and Korean gangster gun fight stand off at the end? Oh because then we can have a missile launcher causing a big explosion."
" Weak story line
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,1,"A girl aproaches two taxi drivers. One she shots in the leg and the other takes her to the hospital. She tells him to wait her outside leaving her bag full of weapons inside the taxi. Inside the hospital nobody seems to notice that she is carrying a weapon in plain sight. She goes into a surgery room, shoots the pacient and asks the doctor to take out the drugs from her body. Then she goes out and contemplate nature. Not one single police officer in sight."
" A mixture of Limitless, Matrix and a bucket of sick
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,1,"This film is so hilariously bad, you have to watch it.It starts off bad, gets a little worse, you'll be really tempted to turn it off but don't! No, keep watching as it gets dumber and dumber and dumber still. Can it continue to get worse? Oh yes!The ending is so spectacularly dumb that it cannot be described, has to be seen to be believed.One day the cast will look back on this and retch."
" ""Now you know what to do."" -I don't
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,4,"What happened? I'm even more confused at what Lucy was trying to talk about. Luc Besson probably tried to create a film with contemplation of humanity, plus what he's good at: heroine physical battles with unidentical enemies. I mean it ended up really not as good: discussing about philosophy that the film established upon, the question was vaguely answered at the end; focusing on action and fight, Lucy either used pistols or her super powers to end every fight, literally no fist fight. Then with all above, the mixture was formed, Lucy, I don't know what happened. The only one contributing to the film was Choi Min-sik, I love the insanity he presented."
" Strong mainstream film
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,5,"With maybe too much gore, the story of Lucy is totally entertaining and worth watching if you like SF movies."
" What if .... ?
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,7,"What if we could get complete control over our cells ?
It was a nice take on the matter but it came with some limitations too.
What if you got two lucys fighting ? ... mindblowing, I guess."
" Damn good sci-fi.
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,7,"My Rating : 7/10Not a single boring minute - it's even great for multiple viewings!'Lucy' is science fiction and philosophy going on an epic romance through the ages - there's drama, action and well there's Scarlett Johansson!Infinitely entertaining - 'Lucy' is great time at the movies."
" Lost in the teeth of the Langoliers
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,8,"It all starts in Taipei, Taiwan, because in 2014, Taipei was the central platform of drug distribution in the world, at least from Asia, and at least too, according to what the film says, and continental China was not yet the monster Trump depicted too often. A poor little American, we guess, girl is trapped into entering a deadly drug trafficking ring by a male acquaintance of hers. It is all entirely fictitious and mostly impossible, but that is not the point. The only point, if there is one, is to show how obsolete humanity is with its vaguely 10% of their brain capacity actually used. So, what about a drug that can widen your brain capacity and capability progressively to 100%?That's the drug Ray Kurzweil would love since he wants to remain alive up to when Artificial Intelligence will cross the red line of human intelligence within now thirty years and become more intelligent than man. So says Ray Kurzweil. He calls that the Singularity. He can only imagine it being possible with millions of nanobots in your veins and your various organs to regulate them and clean them and enhance them, and a lot of food supplements, some being nothing but plain drugs like the one imagined in this film. But Luc Besson is at least not as crazy as Ray Kurzweil and he knows that such a singularity will never happen. So, he can imagine the fact that it would transform the human beings who would take these drugs into pure energy and they will be able to merge with universal energy and negate time.The film is wrong on the concept of time. The concept of time is human, and in the universe, there is only duration cyclically ordered, scanned, sequenced. It is more a tempo than time and this tempo is variable, the very fact that discards this tempo-ized duration to be time: time has to be absolutely regular. We all know how variable some of these natural cycles are: the cycle of the moon has a clear average but in fact, it varies a lot more or less between 27 if not 26 and 29 solar days on earth. We also know the menstrual cycle of women can vary a lot between 15 and 36 days, both from one woman to another and from one period in the life of one woman and another period in the life of the same woman, even if most of the times it only varies between 27 and 29, maybe 30 solar days. And life is experienced in the natural universe through and via such cycles of duration.We cannot understand what a drug cartel could do with such a drug that can make the human user go up in brain capacity. What can be attractive in this phenomenon for a simple Joe Blow? But suspend your disbelief and be credulous for unbelievable possibilities; Luc Besson has always dealt with extreme and often impossible exaggerations. He is the Mark Twain of the cinema and his stories are always tall tales.In a short, shortened version of the long, tall tale, when she reached 100% Suzy will be able to enter all networks and grids and she will be invisible, immaterial, and yet everywhere. I guess this is a revisited version of Buddha's belief that if you die in a state of enlightenment, you step out of the rebirth cycle and you merge with universal cosmic energy. He has to show us this transformation and I must say the special effects and the digital engineering used to produce and process all kinds of images that are supposed to represent nothing at all except this nibbana or nirvana, in Pali or Sanskrit, cover up any meaning in it. But how can you represent something that is not material but purely mental? You just can't. So, the sequences showing this transformation are by far too material and they lack any beauty or even frightening challenge. They are pictorials produced by a computer with the help of software like Photoshop, even maybe more complicated, but the same principle. True enough, since 2014 we have improved our means in this field.So, what's the result? The drug has been recaptured. The Taiwanese mafia has been eliminated. A few dozen French cops have been eliminated too. Lucy has been able to travel back to a certain Lucy in West Africa and transmit her all her knowledge in a gesture identical to that of God and Adam in the Sistine Chapel. Charming but that did not change anything in the present, so it was absolutely useless. It was, in fact, a trip and a gesture that are basically religious in essence. You could have done better. Then going back to the Big Bang, so we may think, does not solve the real problem of knowing what did the big bang go bang from and in? The chaos in Paris driving systematically against the traffic is funny but just absurd and so destructive that it was surreal, meaning unreal.In this film, it was obvious that Luc Besson was starting to evolve towards a type of cinema that has no real depth but is only supposedly fascinating visual effects and rhythmic action. And we all know that we cannot travel in time because the past is the past and has been eaten up the Langoliers of Stephen King, and the future cannot exist before its time because it is the result of what comes just before, so the future has not yet been produced. You can always jump in your seats like some mountain goat and go ""Boom! Boom! Krank! Krank!"" and other animal calls of the sort, that will lead nowhere.Five years later, after returning to Los Angeles, his cinema business in Paris was sold to who knows whom? And is it finally done? One thing is sure Luc Besson is no longer the real boss. Yet since 2012, the studios of this Cité du Cinéma have produced quite a considerable number of films and TV productions. But concerning Luc Besson's films, he is very good at injecting movement into what is by essence slow or static, but that does not create mythology, a mythic vision. Great inspiring texts or discourses have more than just words and intonations. They have inspiration and they create awe and fascination, fright and appeal, angst, and love. I must say this film leaves me rather cold.So, what would you say altogether and in the end? Just one thing. It is slightly exciting due to the rhythm, but rather contemplative' due to the visual effects, and the discourse itself is both too academic or too gibberishly meaningless. Could do a lot better.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"
" Great, unusual concept, but mediocre implementation. Still recommended though.
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,7,"Fiction / action movie. A truly pioneering concept, what would happen if the human brain could perform at 100% of its potential at the same time (although the 10% mentioned is more just a myth rather than reality). The title itself suggests the development of intelligence and evolution since a discovered skeleton of modern humans ancestor was named Lucy. So an ordinary girl gets involved in drug trafficking before she realizes it, only that the new drug is based on a substance that is produced during the embryonic stage of development. Eventually it ends up in an increased amount in her blood and begins to overstimulate the brain. That's where the imagination and the action begin. Obviously, there were plenty of exaggerations especially towards the end of the film, but this is a fantasy film and not a scientific research. Very good acting by both Johansson and Freeman, a lot of imagination especially before the end and a really unusual concept, which only reminds me of The Lawnmower Man (1992) with the increase of intelligence and the end. Unfortunately, despite the great idea and the very good performances, the film did not have a decent script, nor enough imagination or action as a whole, while it could well be developed for at least another half hour to show more imagination or action with nice effects focusing on the increased abilities. Great idea, but poor implementation. It is recommended, but it could be much better.6.5 / 10 from me"
" Good pacing, stupid philosophizing
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,6,"THE BAD
Lots of philosophizing by writers who know nothing about anything.
The writing is so childish that it's very hard to suspend your disbelief.THE GOOD
It's a good superhero story.
Never boring. Definitely entertaining.ADVICE: If you have an ounce of intelligence just lower your expectations a little and enjoy yourself."
" A slightly better made Neil Breen movie
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,4,"You just gotta love when you as a viewer have no idea what are the strengths and weaknesses of your main hero throughout the movie. Creating tension and drama is for shmucks, real kino has none of that, real movies are about how awesome and all-powerful the main hero is and how everyone else just sucks.
Also I would love this movie recast, with Mila Jovovich as Lucy, Bruce Willis as a cop and Ian Holm as a professor... wait, I've seen this one, this is just 5th element all over again, but dumber! Well, I guess its not stealing when you steal from yourself.
And yes, that's not how brain works, using 100% of it is just epilepsy."

" LUCY IS THE BEST
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,10,"Lucy is an amazing movie. During the movie I sat very nervosly to see what happens.The effects are very realistic and the plot has caught me from the beginning.
Lucy is a girl from a drug traffickig team.She is captured by some bad guys,and a very strong drug is inserted in her stomach. Those drugs give you the power to use one hundred percent of your brain,but gradually. Somehow she escapes and the bad guys want to catch her.Lucy gets in touch with the most popular doctor.She wants to give all the information that she has to a computer for the good of the mankind. But the road to the doctor is very dangerous,Lucy fights with the bad ones ,using her powers given by the drugs.

The take on meaning of life, existence, perfect knowledge is a fun one, and deep enough to convey a feeling of grandesse.Big shoutout to the amazing cast, ofc this feels utterly 'overcast', but I love all the big names in such a comparetively shallow script. Comparetively, because all in all it's a thoughtout, well done movie, that - just to set it into perspective - remains an action movie with sci-fi elements.Great watch!"
" Hit and miss? Or just miss?
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,5,"It's one of those movies - you see Luc Besson, Morgan Freeman, Scarlett Johansson, I mean, how bad can it be? Well, it turns out, not that good.The premise of utilizing more of our brain potential is always intriguing, there's some action and a nice message. But the concept gets tedious and difficult to follow, until it turns out sheer simplistic and kind of silly in the end.If you are interested in catching a ""what-if"" movie about utilizing more than 10% of our brain, go see Limitless, which is enjoyably plausible."
" Possible but impossible
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,9,"Awesome imagination about the highest level of humans in a logical way, though fiction but a human can have the capability to have a holistic approach 24*7, this can be achieve my mere observing inside deeply. So 10/10"

" Best story flow
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,9,"To be honest, the first flow of the film was like a crime thriller movie and then comes the sci fi which was the epic part. The main success of the film is that they have explained the sci fi topic as a easily understandable way. A good spending for a sci fi movie lovers. My most loved part was the climax in which Lucy started travelling by time and th graphics of there was really awsome."

It can walk on its own, damn it!I really look forward to rewatching this movie again in the future. That's rare!Great work, a lot of value a lot of tension, a lot of play, real humans. 10 out of 10 prime time production value."
" Deserves more rating than it has (must read)
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,10,"This movie has been a rollercoaster ride for me. It was not just Lucy alone who was experiencing what happens when your brain usage increases. We, as viewers were equally thrilled as if it is happening with us. Anyone who is giving a lower rating to this movie needs to understand that this is an SCI-FIC movie in which SCI stands for Science and FI stands for fiction, which means Fiction in the field of science and technology, So stop complaining that the movie is untrue since we know it already. Nobody knows what happens when you use your brain at better levels because no one ever has. So in the end, it is just the moviewriters' imagination that what would happen if someone reaches that level. What you are guys comparing this movie with? Because there is no Lucy in the real life. Some people wanted Lucy to take advantage of her condition and do more superheroes kind of silly stuff, but probably the director didn't want a superhero movie, but just a science fiction movie which tries to wake you up out of your daily life routine of waking - eating - job - sex - sleeping and to do more with your life. I pity those reviewers who rejected this movie because it is impossible but jumped off their feet when Captain America wield Mjölnir. These reviewers are the reason I didn't watch this mind-blowing movie in the last 6 years but I'm glad at the end I did. Of course, the movie could have many possible ending but to be honest, when you are truly awakened, you are hardly destructive but at eternal peace. Scarlett did a good performance. Innocent in the first half-hour and unstoppable in the rest of the movie. The character matched her commanding yet innocent face. Plus she is beautiful. It is a must-watch movie. Go with it."
" Nope
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,1,"It started well but it took a dramatic turn for the worse.The main actress doesn't 'feel' anymore is a big problem. Not letting an actor show emotion for that long in a movie is distracting and guess what, doesn't let the viewer feel anything for them either.The movie could've been so much more but instead got distracted in giving weak messages of evolution.Don't get me wrong, their acting were all on point but they were given a script that was beneath them."

I watched it with my friend the other day for the 3rd time and she was absolutely shocked with the ending when Lucy (Scarlett Johansen) becomes everything around them as she gains full control of her cerebral capacity (100%). I would highly recommend this film as it's just AMAZING !"
" Fearless attempt at the super human
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,9,"Luc Besson seldom has perfect stories, but who needs perfection.
A ambitious mess has its own charm, there is a fearlessness and willingness to take almost impossible stories and try to do it."
" What a waste
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,7,"Forget the fact that the notion that we use only 10% of our brains is not correct, this movie is a waste of an opportunity. Imagine the movie ends with Lucy using 50 or 60%, you could build a luc besson cinematic universe. More people with different agendas than Lucy and the interactions between them. I wonder what besson would do with that."
" Masterpiece
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,10,"What is so fascinating about Lucy is the fact that she is able to combine the mythology of action films with that of comic books. The protagonist (Scarlett Johansson) is a superhero, but instead of having selective powers - like invisibility or the ability to fly, for example - she has all possible powers. Thanks to an accident involving a synthetic drug, Lucy starts to develop her brain, and soon she can control everything and everyone around her. (That is, drugs can have very positive effects, children, but don't try this at home). The prospect of a character capable of anything can be completely absurd in terms of script, but powerful in terms of image.Lucy does not live in a parallel world, of the future, she is not particularly intelligent or well intentioned. The young woman is accidentally chosen by a group of mobsters these days, and sets out to seek revenge for purely personal reasons: the character does not want to rid the world of drug trafficking, or evil men, just to do an extreme experiment itself, which leads it to seek and steal this synthetic drug from several people. Lucy is one of those strong, avenging women, a hero without character, as was Kill Bill's fascinating Widow, for example. She is one of the only female characters in the entire plot, surpassing all men in intelligence and competence.What follows is an absurd and inventive succession of moments of action. Everyone has seen shots and chases before, but this story makes an unprecedented representation of the action: instead of shooting the bad guys, Lucy disarms them with the power of thought; instead of overcoming them with punches, she sticks the bad guys on the ceiling (!) with a small gesture of the hands; instead of crashing into cars and generating explosions, it causes them to roll over on their own in the middle of the street. The script sends out naturalism and explores the potential of this great video game with sincere joy. The narrative is fast and lean, investing in the progression trajectory - the percentage of the protagonist's brain development appears on the screen, increasing. What will happen when Lucy reaches 100% of your brain?Luc Besson seems really invested in this project. He puts pop rock music in car chases, and soon afterwards uses excerpts of classical music (the same as the highly intellectual Nymphomaniac, by Lars Von Trier) to show the protagonist watching the sap of a tree running through each part of the trunk and roots. Lucy can be serious at times, hilarious at other times, and who would say, even poetic and moving in a few moments. Some images of the cosmos border on parody, others refer to Terrence Malick's transcendental aesthetic. The result, of course, is a surprising mess, aware of its excesses, without fear of displeasing. Lucy constitutes, from now on, a small trash classic, a script for a B film covered in Hollywood packaging.As for the metaphysical pretensions, the discussion about the capacity of the human being, the relationship between time and space, it is merely a background to attribute verisimilitude to history. No one in their right mind can believe the complexity of that scientific data. Everything is obviously false, but the film distorts rules of science to imagine a fiction - thus constituting a science fiction par excellence. The speeches of the great intellectual Norman (Morgan Freeman) are as simple as a pre-university entrance exam review, his data presented in Powerpoint does not convince anyone. But Besson includes comical comments, inserts about the animal kingdom, which reinforce the humorous character of this strange science: no, Lucy does not take herself one bit seriously. And for those who still have doubts, the human being does not use only 10% of his brain, as stated in the premise of the film.Who also deserves congratulations for this film is Scarlett Johansson. The actress could be content with the fame and salary obtained in great action films, in the style of The Avengers, but she continues to seek demanding, difficult roles, such as the operating system in Ela, the man-eating alien in cult-trash Under the Pele, and now of that kind of total woman, heir to the first woman in history, also called Lucy, and equivalent to a goddess among humans (""I am everywhere,"" she says). The actress does well in all these roles, deals with projects with great commitment, and builds in detail the progression between the initial Lucy and the others, with different percentages of the developed brain capacity. Johansson brings this small coherent, insane and fun project to life, marked by a healthy desire to bring something different to action and science fiction blockbusters.I liked this criticism of AdoroCinemaFilm seen on August 26, 2020."

" MIND-BLOWING, SPECTACULAR & AMAZING
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,10,"Lucy is a 2014 French science fiction action film written and directed by Luc Besson and produced by his wife Virginie Besson-Silla for his company EuropaCorp. It is an English-language film shot in Taipei, Paris, and New York City. It stars Scarlett Johansson, Morgan Freeman, Choi Min-sik, and Amr Waked. Johansson portrays the titular character, a woman who gains psychokinetic abilities when a nootropic drug is absorbed into her bloodstream.
The film was released on July 25, 2014, and became a box office success, grossing over $463 million, more than eleven times the budget of $40 million. It received positive, but also polarizing, critical reviews. Although praise was given for its themes, visuals, and Johansson's performance, a number of critics found the plot nonsensical, especially its focus on the ten percent of the brain myth and resulting abilities.
25-year-old American Lucy is studying in Taipei, Taiwan and is tricked into working as a drug mule by her new boyfriend Richard for a South Korean kkangpae and drug lord. Lucy delivers a briefcase to Mr. Jang supposedly containing paperwork, but it actually contains four packets of CPH4, a highly valuable synthetic drug.
After seeing Richard shot and killed, she is captured and a bag of the drug is forcibly sewn into her abdomen to transport the drug for sale in Europe. While Lucy is in captivity, one of her captors kicks her in the stomach, breaking the bag and releasing a large quantity of the drug into her system. As a result, she acquires increasingly enhanced physical and mental capabilities, such as telepathy, telekinesis, mental time travel, and the ability not to feel pain. She also becomes more ruthless and emotionless. Using her new abilities, she kills her captors and escapes.
Lucy travels to the nearby Tri-Service General Hospital to get the bag of drugs removed from her abdomen. Lucy is told by the operating doctor that natural CPH4 is produced in minute quantities by pregnant women during their sixth week of pregnancy to provide fetuses with the energy to develop. Sensing herself growing physical and mental abilities, Lucy returns to Mr. Jang's hotel, kills his bodyguards, assaults Mr. Jang, and telepathically extracts the locations of the three remaining drug mules from his brain.
Lucy begins researching her condition and contacts scientist Samuel Norman, whose research may be the key to saving her. After Lucy speaks with Norman and provides proof of her developed abilities, she flies to Paris and contacts a local police captain, Pierre Del Rio, to help her find the remaining three packets of the drug. During the plane ride, she starts to disintegrate as her cells destabilize from consuming a sip of champagne. To stave off her disintegration, Lucy consumes more of the drug. With the help of Del Rio, Lucy recovers the rest of the drugs. Meeting Norman and his colleagues, she agrees to share everything she now knows as the main point of life is to pass on knowledge, something for which she now possesses an infinite capability.
In the professor's lab, Lucy discusses the nature of time and life and how people's humanity distorts their perceptions. At her urging, she is intravenously injected with the contents of all three remaining bags of CPH4. Her body changes into a black substance that begins spreading over computers and other electronic objects in the lab, transforming them into an unconventionally shaped, next-generation supercomputer. She mentally begins a spacetime journey into the past, eventually reaching the oldest discovered ancestor of mankind, implied to be Lucy. She touches fingertips with her, then goes all the way to the beginning of time and witnesses the Big Bang. Meanwhile, Jang enters the lab and points a gun at Lucy's head. He shoots, but by then Lucy has reached 100% of her brain capacity and disappears, moving into the spacetime continuum. Only her clothes and the black supercomputer are left behind.
Del Rio enters and fatally shoots Jang. Norman takes a black flash drive offered by the supercomputer, after which it disintegrates. Del Rio asks Norman where Lucy is, immediately after which Del Rio's cell phone sounds and he sees a text message: ""I am everywhere."" Lucy's voice is then heard stating ""Life was given to us a billion years ago. Now you know what to do with it."
" Science Fiction
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,7,"The movie was entertaining, however not perfect. It pretty described the science-fiction of using all the brain capabilities and their impacts on the human beings."
" Darwin would be so proud!
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,5,"Lucy is an interesting science fiction movie that takes Darwins theory of human evolution and turns it into a science fiction fantasy on the same level as an X-Men movie.The story follows a young woman named Lucy (Scarlet Johansson) who is forced by a Korean mob boss to smuggle a new kind of drug overseas by way of surgically implanting the packaged drug into her lower stomach. She fights back against her captors and ends up getting kicked repeatedly in her stomach which ends up splitting the bag inside her stomach mixing the drug into her system. Almost immediately her body and cells react violently to the drug as she begins to adapt to it on a cellular level ultimately speeding up the evolutionary process which gives her brain access to the untapped potential of the human brain which makes her smarter, faster and stronger.This isn't the first science fiction movie to explore the idea of accelerated evolution using chemistry and it won't be the last. The storyline isn't that different from the Planet of the Apes reboot trilogy the only difference being that instead of humans it's Apes and instead of an illegal drug it's a new advancement in chemical science. Although Planet of the Apes is just a bit more realistic than Lucy in terms of how evolution actually works but neither movie are close to being realistic.I did find Lucy to be very entertaining it's a fun action movie with enjoyable characters and gorgeous visuals. The action is like a cross between The Matrix and John Wick combining things like characters being suspended in mid air and fast gunplay.My only real gripe with this movie is Lucy's character basically evolves into what can only be described as a powerful mutant from the X-Men universe but even the X-Men comics and movies idea of evolution is more realistic than Lucy's and that's saying something.I recommend watching this movie if you enjoy science fiction action movies as that's pretty much all it is an entertaining hour and a half movie that you say ""meh it was okay"" to after watching."
" Needs a smarter script
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,5,"If you want to make a movie about a super intelligent heroine, you need a super intelligent script. Too many little things make no sense."
" Propaganda for gullible Darwinists
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,5,"Half of this movie is great. The premise of somehow unlocking the full potential of the human brain is a rich subject perfectly suited for the ""Sci-Fi"" genre. ScarJo does an excellent job with the role... until she becomes the emotionless Darwinbot. The notion that the % of usable human brain function is continually ""evolving"" is where the propaganda comes in. I'm not going to get into the whole philosophical debate about Darwinism except to say that it is mind-numbingly idiotic. Humans have never been apes. We have always been human. Choices are what have brought us to the brink of extinction. De-evolution, to be precise. Once we choose to live as we were designed to live, only then will the full potential of our brains be unlocked."
" The first 10 min. are great. That's it!
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,5,Just love how the story opens. Those cuts of Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) getting in that situation with the drug dealers mixed with Chita hunting is great. It is an unusual idea which I found great and hoped to see more of this great editor work but that was it. From that point the film became a movie that just entertains and so nothing special. But still for that introduction that I must say I very appreciated I give this motion picture a 5/10
" Interesting!!!!
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,7,"A delightful action,science-fiction film which toys with the idea of how our capacities as humqn beings would develop if tgere was a way to use the full capacity of our mind instead of the 10% approximately we currently use.I found both the premise and the execution rather delightful.Certainly reconnended despite its frequent hyperboles!!!"
" Utter nonsense
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,1,Just because you get 5 times more brain power doesn't mean you know what to do with it. You can only become a martial arts and weapons expert if you actually learn it. Doesn't matter how much brain power you've got. Anyway an extra 80% of Scarlett Johansson's brain power still isn't that much. Another nonsense modern Hollywood film. Limitless with Bradley Cooper does a better job.
" Truly a great film.
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,"When I first saw it I thought it was a load of c**p and I laughed, I was given the blue Ray but I gave it away for nothing. Not long ago I was bored with nothing to watch so I gave it another chance but this time I concentrated and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, because it was so good, so good in fact it made me think, what if?
It's a action packed thrill ride with a great performance from Scarlett Johansson, she is just as good a action star as any male actor, she's hot, sexy and brilliant.It certainly deserves a much better rating.Brilliant."
" Stupidity in chaos

I had seen similar film Limitless and loved it. But character development and screenplay was so poor that it became just gimmicks of special effects.

Now look at that equivalent space in the trunk. If only we could activate that unused potential in the trunk, right? If this movie was working with the equivalent of that flawed analogy, by the end of the movie they'd be utilizing all the potential in that empty space above the car, extending up into the upper reaches of the atmosphere.I'm not someone that demands scientific purity, necessarily. I expect a certain amount of artistic license to be taken for the sake of a more entertaining experience, but they just keep piling on more and more absurdity to this flawed concept, with Morgan Freeman doing a banal voiceover narration of the complete nonsense as if his voice, alone, can overcome the fundamental stupidity that they keep doubling down on throughout the movie. The ridiculousness becomes more than one can take very quickly, and that point is reached way, way before they're done piling on more idiocy."

If you try to take this movie too seriously you might be disappointed. If you've enjoyed movies like: Transcendence (2014), Interstellar (2014), Limitless (2011), Altered States (1980), etc., then I feel you'll like this one too.Side note: I really enjoyed the quick cuts. Quit unique, very humorous at times, sad at others but always in direct relationship to whatever preceded the quick cut--very entertaining!"

And like Cliff Robertson in 'Charley' and Ray Milland in 'The Man with the X-Ray Eyes' what she discovers along the way both transforms and overwhelms her.Ms Johansson plays yet another of her fantastical superwomen crossed with one of Luc Besson's lethal ladies surrounded by a swift, hallucinatory production that clocks in at a commendably succinct 90 minutes."
" 1 Star people are ignorant

Perhaps if someone were to film dog poop with their 2009 cell phone and shake the phone excessively every other minute, then maybe that movie would deserve 1 star. Maybe.
People that give films 1 star are being intellectually dishonest. If a movie has a premise, which Lucy does, and it has a decent flow of a story line, and it does, then it's already achieved more than 1 star.
One review on this app the person said that they hadn't seen the movie, but gave it one star because people use 100% of their brains. Well it's obvious this person has never seen other sci-fi films. There is no such thing as a Wookie, lightsabers or fast than light travel. You know, fiction.

" Nothing was making sense
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,1,"The imagination of the director was pathetic, no actual concept, no visualisation. Even after such strong cast the movie failed at every expectations."
" Now here's a proper superpower....
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,5,"So ""Lucy"" (Scarlett Johansson) is caught up in a drug smuggling caper. When the package she has in her innards leaks, the new synthetic drug she is carrying gets into her system and boy does it change her. Meantime, Morgan Freeman is a top scientist trying to understand why humankind - and most other sentient beings - appear to exists using less that 5% of their cerebral capacity... Yes, you've guessed it - ""Lucy"" now has a quirk that enables her to use much more of her brainpower; and that in turn enables her to do just about anything - even manipulate matter and time. She is, luckily for all concerned, quite a decent soul and so rather than set out on a course of world domination, she settles for involving a Frenchman policeman, Amr Waked, in her hunt to bring her traffickers to justice and, hopefully, to relieve her predicament. There's plenty of action, loads of car-flipping chases but the vastness of the opportunities offered by the story are not really translated into anything like what could have been. The effects are fine, Scarlett always carries off these kind of roles well enough, but Freeman features very sparingly and offers us very little by way of characterisation. I am afraid that this is just a waste of a good idea..."

" Limitless better

They were inspired by the movie Limitless, but they were ridiculous. There are many inconsistencies in the movie itself. It can only be viewed for action and entertainment purposes. Follow the limitless better. The changes in Limitless were based on a logic framework. They are silly in this movie."
" Absolutely shocking, complete Waste of time

" Just so bad
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,2,"I've never done a review before but I needed to get this out of my chest. This is the worst movie I've ever seen, I thought it would be like Limitless, but the whole thing makes no sense. The plot is just so bad. Only the acting is good. DO NOT watch this. Trust me"
" One word: awful
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,1,"I just did not like this one bit. I clicked on this because I wanted to see a women superhero, with some decent powers. But so many parts just made no sense to me, I'm a film graduate and I found this hard.
I felt like the film was trying in parts to be weird, just to be weird when they could have gone down a better, simpler path. So much was just simply unexplained and done just because she has these ""powers"". She is a superhero so she can do this random thing now for no reason.
The characters: they had 0 depth, so I didn't care what happened to anybody. Morgan Freeman's character didn't serve a purpose. Other than do that lecture he might has well not been there.Yeah I didn't enjoy this one I won't lie. And if you are watching for a simple watch. Do not"
" On paper this would be exactly my kind of movie
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,6,"The first time I watched this I was so disappointed that I forgot everything about this movie. I watched it again just now and I can appreciate some of it. The action is great. I find it very hard to suspend my disbelief because they focus way too much on the ""humans use only 10 percent of the brain"" myth and its not just ""fake science"" like I would let every movie get away with. It's bad fake science. If they just cut all the scenes with Morgan Freeman or toned down the focus on the percentage thing this movie might actually have been great. It's a missed opportunity to make a smart movie I think."
" Probably hit or miss for most viewers
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,6,"This movie has an interesting premise but doesn't do much with it. It has many, many flaws and you'll have to suspend your disbelief in order to enjoy it. A lot. Virtually every minute.See, the main problem isn't that much that the entire movie bases on the myth that we only use 10% of our brain. I am okay with that, you take this one thing, establish that this IS true in the world this movie takes place and then go with it. But everything else isn't any better. Our brain is doing ONE thing: Thinking! So this drug would make us super smart but that's it. But in the movie the drug allows her to do everything from telekinesis to shapeshifting and outright magic. There are lots of scenes with pseudo-science talk that tries to explain this but you don't need to be a scientist to know all of it is more than fiction, it's fantasy.On top of all that pseudo-science you'll also get an even bigger dose of pseudo-philosophy. I don't know if they just mixed every remotely related eseteric theory or if it's the fault of the mostly horrible dialogues, but seriously, most of the science and philosophy talk in this movie sounds like they took all the rejected ideas that Lindelof wrote for LOST but were considered too crazy or corny even for him!If it was just the bad science and corny philosphy, I wouldn't complain, though, as long as it's just a vehicle for a fun action movie. However, it also affects the script and movie.
First, there are many illogical scenes that wouldn't even work within the bad science we get presented. For example Lucy just watches someone speaking a few lines of mandarin and a moment later she is fluent in that language. No matter how smart, you can at best learn the words that have been spoken. Or, later she begins to disintegrate when she is running low on drugs. She literally lost many of her teeth, her skin was peeling off in clouds of dust >and eye was displaced<. Then she takes more drugs and the process isn't just stopped, it magically changed her to the state she was in minutes earlier.But more importantly, the authors somehow wrote themselves into a corner about one third into the movie because at that point she was already a being with superpowers that nobody could match and here adversaries are still simple humans. During her next encounter with the bad guys there is no fight anymore, she just makes them float around.
So, in order to still have some action scenes, what did they do? Lucy forgets about her superpowers, locks herself in with those scientist to have a slow verbal conversation about her current state even though she is about to build a supercomputer and store every information she has. This forces the poor police to fight the bad guys themselves even though Lucy could have dispatched them easily within a minute or so.And once you start looking for things like this, you'll notice them everywhere. The very first thing she does after the drugs start powering here is killing half a dozen henchmen with ease within a second. She kills guards without flinching, even that poor guy on the operation table. But she lets the crime boss that is responsible for all of this go without killing him? And again, later, in the police station, she does it again with the captain of the henchmen? Just so we can have another unecessary encounter with them later?
Lucy does, however, kill a lot of innocent byspenders during her car romp through Paris. I mean, yes, we don't see anybody get killed on screen but come on, that many crashes, flipped cars and so on can't be without casualties.And most of this would easily be avoidable. All they would have needed to do is one of two things:
A) Either tone it down and give her superpowers later in the movie, bit by bit
OR
B) simply let that henchman captain eat some of the remaining drugs at some point so he gets superpowers as well so we can have a proper fight!But as it is this movie doesn't work as SciFi thriller because the science is so bad, it doesn't work as a philosophic or fun movie because Lucy doesn't really do anything with it, but it also doesn't work as an action movie. I don't even know why many claim it to be one, there aren't many action scenes and the ones we have are either unnecessary, short, underwhelming or a combination of those.So, why do I still rate it 6 then? It still got that many stars for the eye candy and generally everything else that hasn't to do with the plot. Johanson played well in the first half (later on she is like an emotionless robot) and the special effects were quite good. I was also pleased to see authentic set pieces in Taiwan (I have family there, so I can tell it's genuine). The movie has a lot of potential but it just doesn't know where to go with this."
" Great beginning, ridiculous ending
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,4,"Everybody understands it wasn't supposed to be a documentary or serious science fiction movie. But after the first half, it seems the creators get tired and say WTF let's go crazy. It becomes cartoonishly silly. If it wasn't the great acting and looks of Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman, few people would bother to watch."
" Interesting plot, poor execution
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,4,"Lucy is a science fiction action movie directed by Luc Besson and stars Scarlett Johansson, Morgan Freeman, Amr Waked and Choi Min-Sik.To be honest the plot of the movie is fresh and realistic but with some loopholes the movie disappoints.The acting is good and Scarlett Johansson impresses in the role from a frightened drug mule to a super powered human being with extraordinary powers. Morgan Freeman is a legend and knows how to reprise his roles. Choi Min-Sik was marvellous in the role of a brutal drug lord. Amr Waked was also good.The only problem was the execution and loopholes. Here are the few loopholes. Why the captors started kicking her stomach when they are aware that she is carrying a packet of drugs in her stomach, the drug is shown as very costly and vulnerable? Why did she go to a hospital to remove packet out of her stomach as in the previous scene she had removed a bullet from her body herself? If she was so keen to save the humanity by taking the possession of drugs why did she killed the patient on operation table? and why she shot an innocent taxi driver just because he can't speak English? From a brutal who is killing and shooting everyone to a humble and soft human in the end is something which was needed an explanation.The movie would've been much better provided more attention were given on the development of a good plot rather focusing more on senseless action."
" good movie with well action packed scenes 7\10
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,7,"The first part of the film was pretty grusome and I had a hard time watching it. but at soon as I got through with it and continued watching, apparently it is a well done movie with really good scenes. I loved the character of lucy, how from a young student she evolves in to something completely out of human logic, it is a well done character development and it goes perfect with the whole plot of the movie that talks about evolution and using percents of the human brain to evolve. great job scarlett johansson!. and morgan freeman is as always a revolution in his roles, how he talks and how hw acts during the film is just fantastic. the editing was good and very accurate to the film. how they show scenes of the nature and evolution, showing some shots of the nature and how it connects to the plot."
" Lucy
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,7,"The topic discussed in this movie is about the world after the development of the human brain. According to the current development of humans, Einstein is said to be the highest, with 20%. This data is speculative and cannot be verified. So it gives people more imagination. Many people say that the special effects of this movie are rough, and the discussion of the topics is not deep enough. This is because human imagination has limits. Basically, the special functions that can be used in Hollywood are all used up. And all the imagination of science fiction comes from human observation and longing for unknown things. For example, we envy birds flying, so superhumans can fly, we envy cats can fly over walls, and cat people appear, and we envy invincible The body, and then Iron Man appeared, taking you to appreciate the high-tech of future armor. In fact, after all, it is a kind of psychological compensation for the audience.
As for Super Body, his important meaning is not to present a movie to everyone. The conflicts and conflicts in the movie are far-fetched and there is no need to exist, such as why not kill the blackboard boss, such as why not kill the chase The gang of gangs will then execute their own super brain plan, all this is just to make this movie more like a movie. Everyone who appears in this film is working to continue the development and discussion of the brain for the director.
The old drama bone Morgan Freeman has been telling everyone about the brain story from the beginning, forcibly making up lessons, and in the end did not participate in the important plot of the story, he is the interpreter in the movie, telling you, you do n't understand Come, let me take you to the theater together, and let me explain to you.
So this film can remove all the story attributes, because he does not affect what the director wants to say. The director just shows you a fresh idea and tells you what you can do if it reaches 20%, then 40%, 50%, 80%, 100% ...
So what is 100%? is God? Because everywhere! It's time, because he is everywhere!
So the film conceived us about the human brain, the infinite possibilities of the human brain. It has nothing to do with the story.
This film is a science and education film in a story coat."

So i dont want to say spoiler about this movie, just watch it for relax..."
" Maybe I had a big expectation
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,5,"If I would watch this film random, probably I would like it more but I was a little bit disappointed about the flow of the script especially ending was unsatisfied. Visual effects are good, acting is normal but did not catch me somehow. Must be watched but not a classic."

" Desperate to be smart, but fails
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,5,"It tried desperately to be smart, but kinda failed with it's gaping plot holes, unexplainable change of character personality, and fails in scientific knowledge. Nonetheless, the movie was an interesting concept that if executed properly, it would've been the next ""Inception."" The special effects were great and that's the only quality of this movie that didn't bother me in some way."
" Amazing! Focused on Human mind
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,10,"A really surprising mindbending movie created by Luc Besson is amazing more than science fiction and mindbending. This film really gives us the unlimited power of human mind. And Scarlett Johansson... Played her role best. At first this film thrilled you... When this film catch it's speed .... This film just engaged you in this film. I loved this Film because the Idea is fresh and focused on the human mind power. ""What happened if you can use 100% of your brain"" this film gonna give you answer of this question. Overall this film is best and must watch film."
" Great Movie About Idealism
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,8,"The danger with beliefs is not you're going to hold wrong beliefs, it's that you hold beliefs at all. Therefore, when you fill your mind with a lot of ideas about what's true or what's false that than obviates the searching for deep direct experiences. You're not willing to let go because you're stuck in a paradigm lock. People like to think that they can represent reality with ideas without recognising their ideas are apart of reality. There are limits on what you can represent with ideas. Representation is not the real thing and as simple as it sounds a lot of highly intelligent people forget this. That's where a lot of stuff goes wrong because if reality was simple and not complex, and reality was intuitive and not counterintuitive than this strategy might work. Except, what humanity has discovered time and time and time and time and time again is that reality does not work in the way we assume. Reality is filled with very weird paradoxes and facts that are completely contrary to anything we assume and that many of our speculations that this is contrary to direct experience. Your speculation about reality are always suspect and could always be overruled by direct experience. The movie isn't perfect but it tries to open your mind to new possibilities."

" still spreading 10% rumor in 2014?!
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,1,"I literally gave up the movie songs 20 minutes in when Morgan Freeman said ""10%"" but i did spend another half an hour skipping to try and understand what Benson was trying to say.since the first scene, it's clearly a philosophical movie. and the second one sets the tone for the action and timing. but the attempted science in it is completely intolerable and unreliable. it ruins the whole experience.there is, still and indeed, an interesting philosophical question about the meaning of life. i say question because the movie does claim to answer it but it actually barely scratches any real answer. it's just spoiled beliefs around what's time and life.reason i give it 0 stars is because of wasted resources. so much potential thrown away. if you want a good action philosophy, try Matrix or Deadpool. there aren't that many action movies that can do philosophy... but this one just hit a hard rock bottom!"
" Okay
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,6,"Intersting plot yet the overrated power of knowledge creates holes which draws the movie away from essential good-movie ingredients like character development, feeling and emotion."
" Flatters to deceive
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,5,"This is a hard movie to rate so I've gone down the middle. There are some pretty spectacular action scenes and the visuals are incredible but the whole movie is too fast paced and any and all character development has been abandoned. The film really suffers for this, Johansson's role in particular, as her character is very difficult to connect with. I don't agree that she played it well, she was a hackneyed stereotype ""dumb"" New York broad at the outset and then tried to juxtapose that against a permanently serious, hyper-intelligent robot after her drug enhancement. The former character was a lazy effort and the latter just came across as wooden. If Keanu Reeves irritated you in The Matrix then so will she. There was a scene that tried to connect the two characters together, where she talked to her mother during transition but it didn't work and there were no vestiges left of her initial character. Some conflict in terms of what she loses from her original life versus what she gains from her super powers would have been interesting.Of course it's ridiculous to get all worked up about the scientific nonsense in the film, it is sci-fi. What bothers me though is that there's no real reward for the viewer in accepting the premise, there are many philosophical and moral concepts that could have been explored. At the half way point it's all set up for this, then Luc just downloads a pointless shoot out scene (why weren't these ""bad guys"" just killed at the start anyway? Lucy had no problem killing others at random and she hated the mafia goons more than anyone). This is accompanied by a good 15-20 minutes of full throttle CGI, zooming around time and space with no obvious purpose.The plot suggested that the climax of the film was the unveiling of the inner workings of the universe, this ultimate knowledge to then be deposited on a pen drive for the good of mankind (in some way, again not explored). It might have looked like some mysterious black hole pen drive but it could have been a 5 dollar stick from Walmart quite frankly because all that she explored was the history of the universe as we already know it anyway! There was nothing other than currently accepted theories of evolution, the asteroid collision and separation of our moon, the forming of our solar system from nebulae and lots more of that all the way back to the big bang! There was a bit just before this where the big bang was sucking its source material from another parallel plane but it wasn't a patch on how Men In Black did it, with the universe in a marble that aliens are playing with. Now that was thought provoking.If you treat the film as a pure, mindless action flick then it's entertaining. Just don't get drawn into thinking that it's going to provide any level of pathos or cerebral stimulation because it rips you off on that front after sewing the seeds so well initially. The ending was flat as a pancake. A shame, as Leon showed us what Luc Besson is capable of."

" Complete nonsense
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,5,"Lucy (2014) is something in-between of a bad sci-fi film written by someone who doesn't know how the genre works and a basic action film with a very pretentious script.Lucy is too nonsensical and not nearly grounded enough to be an enjoyable sci-fi film since it not only has no rules whatsoever but also breaks its own rules that are not even there (imagine that). I mean, she can manipulate matter, intercept radiowaves, see in x-ray vision, but she still needs to fly by plane, to drive cars, she needs the help of other people to make her a drip only to have at least 2-3 characters in the film.
She says she feels everything and remembers everything, yet she calls her mom to tell her that she loves her, even though she acts completely emotionless all the time. She says she doesn't feel fear and a couple of scenes later she seems frightened when she starts to disintegrate like in The Avengers on the plane. Inconsistencies like these just show how unaccustomed the writers were with the genre.The film also has a drug lord villain who is so unnecessary and incredibly not threatening to her it just makes no sense (also, great job on wasting Min-sik Choi in this). They make parallels to wild nature indicating that she was prey for a predator and then she sort of becomes the predator, but not really and they never come back to this...whatever.I'm not even going to start on the brain capacity usage, ok, a theory is a theory, whatever, but you've got to have rules in your sci-fi story or it will completely derail into absurdity.P.S. Yes, Luc Besson, we know you love female heroines and stacking up police cars."

I was fine with it in ""Limitless"" were this was still an acutal belief of the scientific world. But expect something better in 2014, also when they try so hard to sound sciency.

",2020-03-22 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this for the most-part. The momentum in combination with the 90 minute runtime, kept myself entertained for the entirety. It's far from perfect, but it's entertaining. Then again I didn't labour over the science to over complicate the overall enjoyment. The climax is probably the most contentious and unfavourable issue, but I appreciate the intent of Luc Besson's vision.Note: It's probably best to ignore the super low-scoring trolls, who create accounts to downvote and spread negativity. If you don't have some constructive criticism, don't say anything at all. Any 'Not helpful' downvotes on this review are probably by the aforementioned."
" Shallow writing and lack of any internal consistency
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,2,"There is good science fiction and bad science fiction, this movie is very bad science fiction. It lacks any internal consistency, leaves huge gaping holes in the so called explanations of what is happening, and tells a very boring story. Morgan freeman plays no role in the story except for background. Skip this movie if you can."
" Terrible movie
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,1,"To say boring it would be very good evaluation, but this is beyond stupid and boring. Definitely the worst movie of my life."
" Bad action movie and even worse si-fi movie
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,5,"There are some interesting parts in the film, like the nature scenes at the beginning that gets your attention but overall is premise is dumb and Scarllat's character, I know it's supposed to have almost no emotions, but this makes her character not reliable in any way, in the end, it's just a weird film, and I like weird stuff when it's done right, it fails as an action, and also fails as a science fiction a complete mess."
" Ignore the science, enjoy the action
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,7,Bad science turned into an actually satisfying action movie.3.5/5.
" Well
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,5,"Not amazing. The trailer looks very good and I was super excited about watching it but in reality it is like it's a very short film where they try and pack as much as they can into a very short space of time when in reality it is a long film. It has almost two separate story lines. The one about her becoming super human and the consequences therefore and the drug trafficking.This film left me with a LOT of questions, none of which were answered. Very good acting but poorly planed story line and plot.I was delighted to see Julian Rhind-Tutt playing the very British and funny scientist! The st was well done. Scarlett was amazing visually and mentally. Morgan was what you would expect of the legend. There was not nearly enough character development tho"
" quite good, considering that it is a Besson movie..
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,6,"This could have been much worse, considering that it is a Besson movie. It's not a 10/10 movie, but if you take it for what it is (an imaginative Sci-Fi french movie), then it's quite good.the basic idea is well developed, after all, and the key behind it is told when Lucy says that the only measure unit in the universe is Time. Everything else is a construct of our brain. That's why she is able to move through time at the end of the movie. It's so blatantly evident but still some of the big-brained bad reviewers seem to have missed it entirely. Probably they were already sit in front of their computers ranting while writing a bad review.still, the movie has many defects though being quite enjoyable. some Star Trek movies are considered far superior but they are much more stupid than this one."
" Combination of superhero and sci-fi
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,7,Worth watching it... Super action movie with essence of super hero and sci fi touch ... Scarlett just nailed it .
" Pretty good actually
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,9,"In the beginning I thought maybe a 7.5 because the movie was good but in my opinion I Don't think that would happen if we use our brain 100%, but a comment in this section made me rethink. It's sci-fi, so just enjoy the movie, a sci-fi doesn't need to have a logic, just imagination and creativity. I would have give it a ten but I am a little picky and I give 10/10 really hard."
" Not terrible, if you can get over the (lack of) science.
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,5,"The main problem with this film is its classification as Science-Fiction, because the science aspect is laughably awful. The myth of humans only using 10% of our available brain power was debunked a long time ago (although I can understand why it persisted given the terrible decisions most of us make on a regular basis).That said, the film does have some plus points - production values are high and the acting is generally good. The first half in particular contains some scenes which generate genuine tension - it's not hard to imagine oneself in a situation (like Lucy) where your fate is completely determined by others and your life is of little concern.Unfortunately the second half of the film is something of a mess, with action and special effects taking the limelight rather than the story or dialogue. It would have been nice to find out a little more about Lucy and how she came to be in this situation.Overall I'd say this film isn't terrible, but I think an opportunity was missed to create an interesting and compelling story. And the science aspect is cringe-worthy for any true Sci-Fi fans."
" Sweet movie
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,7,"Sweet movie like dear Scarlett i really like it. Scene, Scarlett's beauty and action."
" Nothing.
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,3,Hey that's nothing in here... It's a 0. +3 because there's Scarlett.
" Dont go by the ratings. Its a MUST WATCH!
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,9,This film absolutely blew me! I was glued to my seats for 90mins straight. Its totally a myth but what if its all true? An absolute must watch. I really don't know why it's rated only 6.4 on Imdb. A 9 on 10 for me! Great movie!
" Terrible plot
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,3,"The premise of the plot - humans use only 10 percent of their cerebral capacity, you can unlock the rest with a blue meth from Breaking Bad. Fact - humans use their whole brain, just not all of it at once at every moment. Hence, we can all go home, the movie is built on an incorrect premise, a myth perpetuated by uneducated people."
" I am everywhere
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,8,"A female American college student on an exchange trip to Taiwan gets caught up in a horrible drug deal and turns into a drug mule. When the drug she's forced to carry inside her body leaks into her system, she gains unimaginable powers that unlock her brain's full potential. Speaking of which, Lucy is based on the popular fallacy that we humans use only a small percentage of our brain, about 10%. But I have never before seen a movie that takes full advantage of a fallacy and made it so entertaining. Like Luc Besson's other films, he takes a simple, corny story and executes it so well. I remember seeing it in the theater and how mind-blown I was. The film's lessons and theories about how life evolves on earth and how the foundations of math and science are mere sketches and the capability of the brain. It makes one wonder: what if we could use all of our brain capacity at once? Would we be able to make things move with our minds? Could we change our appearances? Could we teleport? Because the film's philosophies are incredible but the plot itself is a bit silly, I'm giving it an 8/10."
" Irresistible
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,8,"It's one of those movies I can't stop watching once I start. Despite its many flaws, it's captivating. Morgan Freeman appears lost throughout, but Scarlett is terrific. She and Besson seem to have been on the same wavelength."
" Lucy !!
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,8,The concept of the movie is really strong... SCARLETT JOHANSSON nailed it as LUCY....Story and Length of the movie could be extended to explore more..& and the Ending of the movie could be better...none the less overall a great concept movie ..
" Live this movie
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,10,Watched it three times. I love that she remembered her childhood. The only flaw I thought was reducing all of her down to an USB stick will make it dated.
" Really liked this despite crappy reviews.
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,8,"You have Luc Besson so it aint going to be highbrow Shakespearian type storytelling. Scarlett Johanson is great, she can really act. I really liked tjis movie. Its not meant to be a documentary! It is bloody good fast paced Sci-Fi. Well done, well executed and very enjoyable. Suspend reality, open your mind and be entertained.."
" Perhaps one of the worst films I've ever watched
",2019-12-23 00:00:00,1,Perhaps one of the worst films I've ever watched. You have to have an IQ of a toad to enjoy this film. The best part of the film was that it was only one and a half hours long so I didn't have to endure this catastrophe of a film for too long. You literally can't watch 1 minute of this film without running into a plot hole.
" Total nonsense
",2019-11-30 00:00:00,1,There was a thread of a story wasted by total nonsense and a ridiculous ending. The story of a woman forced into carrying a drug which leaks and turns her into a superhuman could have been interesting. But it was undercut with so much nonsense about the 10% brain usage and a nonsensical time travel ending that it was very hard to watch. I fast forwarded several times because the absurdities were too much. This took pseudoscience in cinema to an extreme. Even the sequences of her transformation were silly. It's like they had specific visuals which they wanted but had little thought where to put them. I read that the directory said that this movie was 10 years in development. But they could only come up with this?
" utter nonsense
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,1,"How is this rated 6!!!
Aovie based on a myth, and they double Dow on the falsehood at every chance they get in this movie, there's nothing to be said, nothing to criticize ...
Acting... mediocre
Sfx ... mediocre
Directing...mediocere"
" Winner winner chicken dinner
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,7,"Ok. I only gave it a 7, but it was a good movie. Scarlett did well and it was directed by Luc Besson. Besson did Valerian as well as many TV shows whether it was writing or directing. Nothing cheap here. But it's starts a head movie and then it goes into something far beyond reality which I wasn't expecting at all. I was hoping it was going to be more realistic. Kinda lost me."
" Absolute rubbish
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,1,"Enough said, can't believe that anybody would fund this nonsense."
" Can someone tell Scarlett Johansson not to play in action movies?
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,1,"When you have an average script which can be entertaining although and you cast Scarlett Johansson for the role your project have already failed. She is incapable to convince the viewer that he sees a film, but Scarlett trying unsuccessfully to act."
" It was surprisingly very good
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,9,"I didn't know what to expect, the trailer didn't really tell the story. Also Morgan Freeman, anything he's in, I'm watching. He's the best! Scarlett Johansson was also refreshing in this role, well done! The movies kept my attention 100%. And I didn't see a lot of things coming, which the viewer doesn't get that often. If your ready to dissect the science, get over yourself! It's Science-Fiction at it best, and you don't have to be up in a spaceship hunting down aliens. Give it a go, it's a good watch!"
" suspending disbelief is beyond any possibility for this movie
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,3,"Lets say i love sci fy and i love fantasy and i love action movies.and im quite capable to suspend disbelief in most movies.
i watch superhero movies i watch space operas.. and when you watch such movies you know this is beyond real life possibilities therefore you can suspend disbelief and enjoy the movies.
this movie however fals into the science category so you as a viewer tend to check the things shown and said of to what you know is known and real in science.
ive seen a movie like this before that i could enjoy and was quite similar even if it also does not check with science.
that movie is limitless.
the premis we only use 10% of our brain is an old one that just wont die but not based on what science says.
however if that is the only thing thats unrealistic i and many others can suspend disbelief and accept it for this movie.
once you do that anything showing immense mental capabilities can also be accepted .
so i loved limitless.
this movie however goes beyond so many things its laughable.
take limitless and throw in . telekineses,telepathy deffying gravity,projecting images on tv screens straight from toughts, changing hair color legnth and shape, hell flying apart into could of dust and reassembling.seeing through walls ground doors. watching lines coming out of cellphones that are supposed to be the cellulalr wirells data lines?? and touching it with fingers and reading it ???
while this is not a mary sue movie. wehre the hero has not gone though growth and hardship before becomeing powerfull. this movie does have links to mary sue writing.
reality , nature and scientific laws are bend for her to succeed.
anything is possible to further the plot.
basicly she turns into a godlike being that transcends all physical laws of this universe.
so here i am watching this movie , and i find it a ridiculous version of limitless.
for the role given scarlet johanson acted well.
the script , well lets just say the forst part wass amazing. up untill the part the drug changed her and she was rolling on the ceiling.
i will watch thif to the end because im just 60% through and i always finish what i start. but lets just say my eyes are rolling so much and sighing through this one its torturous. .
if you haven seen limitless yet. and also this one not yet. and need to choose. then choose limitless.
you will be able to suspend disbelief for real and enjoy."
" Deep, deftly-made, and morally bankrupt
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,6,"After spending 24 hours reflecting on ""Lucy"":I've seen some movies in which monsters become heroes, and some in which heroes become monsters. I've seen many movies with characters that are both heroic and monstrous.I think ""Lucy"" is the only movie I've seen in which we're asked to accept a monster as a hero even though she is consistently monstrous and never once heroic.The only theme I can find in this movie is that, in the fight to survive, might makes right and the lives of less gifted or less powerful people are disposable. The monster becomes immortal at the end of the story, which is ambiguous at best - on the one hand she is no longer rampaging through the city streets endangering public safety, but at the same time she has never shown any ethical concern whatsoever for anyone's well-being but her own.We are told to likewise pursue individual immortality, apparently with utter disregard for the needs and integrity of others. Immortality in this case is defined entirely in terms of biological and intellectual information - moral and emotional information is completely neglected. In this light, the ambiguity of the ending is terrifying. This could be a very successful monster movie if writer/director Luc Besson had given any indication at all that he was aware of the terrifying moral and ethical implications of his story. Unfortunately he seems to think Lucy is far from being a monster, but is in fact an ideal woman: smart, beautiful, powerful, and devoid of empathy or righteousness.6/10 for its depth and deftness of storytelling"
" 7+
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,7,Solid movie.A good mix of scifi and action which kept us thoroughly entertained.Will definitely watch again.
" Human brain evolution
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,10,"This movie shows us how brain works , importance of Dolphin, is the only thing uses its brain more than human ( 10 percent ) and dolphin uses its cerebral capacity 20 percent , and dolphin has echolocation system which is found in nowhere else. Human beings evolution starts with one cell then split and so on until big Bang , cells could make one person then into another and so on , humans with this minority power this 10 percent could develop and cultivate the Earth ,There is a Philosophy , humans are more having than being .
Humans are not unity of measurement , mathematics are not universe's laws , it is Time ,
Time fives legitimacy to its existence , Time is the only unit of measurement. Without time , we don't exist . Time is unity .I believe , God loves us that grant us 10 percent . Otherwise universe would be ruined .
And no theory of humans evolution are true ."
" Unique movie
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,9,This is a different movie i feel like i was with her y the rating is less i can't understand maybe u didn't feel that moment there expression and acting skills villa attitude camera work production work all this are very good concept is normal but screenplay is awesome and even her acting is good 4.5/5
" Worst movie ever made
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,1,"Started off good, then she gained powers and used none of it for good, let a tonne of people die then turned into a usb, worst movie ever."
" Watched this title thrice with kid.. and wife.
",2019-10-29 00:00:00,10,"They both where so impressed with the CONTENT.. (wether its truth or myth)
Only real scientists know about same..But on request I had to take both kid/wife together for another 2 shows.As far as I am concerned I was fascinated with a brilliant idea, behind great brains and specially the SCIENTIST who believed in LUCY.Lot of more to say soo little time, will edit this review for sure someday
(Many on my lists, I only review, where i like/disliked most)."
" Good action movie.
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,8,This is a very good movie with the fast action and fighting maneuvers.
" Lucy
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,5,"Luc Besson mixes action with science fantasy in this slick but empty thriller.Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) is forced to become a drug mule in Taiwan with her body inserted with capsules of a new synthetic drug CPH4. When it leaks into her system, her mind accelerates in its abilities and she begins to transcend.Chased by the drug kingpin's gang, Lucy ends up in Paris as she seeks help from Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) an expert on the potential of the human body.With shades of Limitless, Lucy wants to say something about the power of the human mind and evolution but settles to be a dumb action thriller."
" Intresting and unique..mostly
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,7,"I liked this one especially the first 3/4 of it, the end goes a bit silly. Its a cool movie, very Luc Besson identifiable, his style. Great action sequences, interesting locations China, France- I always like to see movies not specifically in America.Very interesting and unique story idea -that humans only use 10% of their brains and Lucy can break this barrier and reach a whole new level in human evolution. Scarlett Johansson is amazing here, impressive, when she first gets kidnapped so scared then as the drug leaks into her system so badass.Morgan freeman -much as I adore him often does these sort of cameos in movies these days and not much acting. He is good here as the sympathetic scientist... Just thinking he was also in that movie with Johnny Depp, Transcendence very similar story, he does more here."
" I wish it was a remake of Limitless, but it becomes very silly very fast
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,4,"I saw this movie a couple of years ago, and decided to review it now after reading a review about another movie that compared unfavorably to this one. How can a movie be worse? It's very hard to like Lucy after you've watched it to the end. It starts good - pretty much like Limitless - a failed adult is exposed to a drug allowing her to use 100% of her brain and she becomes super smart and capable in a short time. But then the choices this genius makes and the stuff she does and doesn't do to get out of a dangerous situation, are just plain silly. And after you've don't care anymore and just want this movie to end, it becomes silly on a truly galactic scale, but I won't say any more so not to spoil your face-palming."
" Lucy Simply Rocks
",2019-09-15 00:00:00,7,"I like this one a lot - good production, a fine cinematography, plus lots of well ""composed"" action scenes and a fantastic Scarlett Johansson. The story of course is one of pure fantasy but Luc Besson's movies mostly have that taste of ueber-life. Well done."
" Not real
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,5,Well it was kinda good but I hated thier acting. Btw we human use all of our brain
" Below Average: 4.0
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,4,"Even putting aside the ridiculous premise, I didn't really have that much faith going into Luc Besson's latest. The French action legend hasn't made a truly good film since La Femme Nikita back in 1990. That being said, he hasn't made any terrible movies since then either, and this somewhat dubious trend continues with Lucy. As is the case with most of Besson's work, anyone with half a brain will be able to follow the storylne with little trouble. Lucy unintentionally ingests an experimental drug. This raises her mental capacity to ridiculous heights, effects-driven hijinks ensue. Pretty standard stuff really, and the leaps in logic are so glaringly obvious that ignoring them quickly becomes a distraction (why push cars out of the way you could simply fly over them?). Granted, this fact does not seem to go unnoticed by the film itself, as several welcome moments of self-awareness manage to slip themselves organically into the storyline. But even knowing of its inherent flaws is not nearly enough to save Lucy from its cliched, high-concept plot and bring action."
" I liked it a lot!
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,10,"Finally a movie that you need to think through a bit, it's fun to wonder."
" Lucy
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,5,5/10 - really cool science-based action plot line is ruined by poor execution
" Love the science
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,8,"I liked the science and concepts of this movie, and had just enough action as well, good story line. Great actors and characters. Watched several times."
" Unimaginative and pseudoscientific cringyness
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,3,"So be it that ""Lucy"" perpetuates the boring ten percent of the brain myth. It's more difficult to accept the ridiculous and unimagitative depiction of a person who extends these ten percents. Somehow accessing her full brain gives her control over matter, neatly giving her the ability to overcome every obstacle (even the expendable evil Koreans). Good for her, boring for the audience.Lucy's development fall in the predictable trope ""higher mental capasity = acting like a robot"". ""I don't feel pain, fear, desire. It's like all things that make us human are fading away,"" Lucy says. But accessing her full brain would logically make her feel even more and make her more human. I'd rather watch an emotional roller coaster ride development like that than robot Scarlett kick Korean ass.At one point she's about to disintegrate though, Jeff Goldblum style, and that's kind of cool. But in the next scene she's all right again. Phew! For a moment I expected some interesting development there.""Lucy"" is full of pseudoscientific stuff that doesn't impress at all. Like, ""All social systems we've put into place are a mere sketch. (You don't say?!) Time is the only true unit of measure"" is presented as Lucy's revelation towards the end of the film. And what is time, if I may ask? But the film doesn't bother to explore the concept of time. That's too heavy and untouchable for this kind of flick."
" Stupid. As in stupid.
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,3,"Ill give the movie 3 - because of an interesting concept, and the first 25 minutes or so, were actually very interesting, exiting and well-written.
From there in it is more like very, very. very poor writing, nothing makes sense, and you have a feeling, that the producers said something like:""Hey - we have a terrible script - lets cover it up with CGI. Like with tons of CGI. And a few good well-known actors. - That should do the job of making a block-buster. right?""No.Dont waste your life on this movie.Why should accessing more of our cerebral capacity make us able to become a god? And if that really happens - why should that god choose a USB stick as the medium where we could find all information on?Nothing makes sense in this movie."
" Lucy is as unbelievable as Love,Death&Robots unique and fantastic is
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,10,"This movie is propably the most fantastic, unrealistic and over the top movie ever.

" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,9,"Awesome awesome awesome. so interesting and crazy. beastly action. amazing music. epic scenes. has an artsy aspect to it. so imaginative and creative. so many parts where I said I've never seen anything like this and don't think I would even be able to imagine something like that. great acting. a bunch of scenes that will stand out in my memory. also a PERFECT example of how much better a movie is when you don't watch any previews and know nothing about it (5 viewings)
SPOILERS
intensity continues to rise throughout the movie that leads to a perfect ending."
" Weird, cringy but a good story
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,6,"Some of the scenes in the movie are weird, like just way too weird to watch.The language is unintelligible. When these people speak I can't understand, they should've hardcoded the foreign language subtitles so we, the viewers could understand what these people are saying.Some of the scenes just exist & they just leave questions hanging on the minds of the viewers.Overall the story is good. A really good remake of this movie can be done in the future."
" Fantastic
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,8,"For everyone taking science classes here,this movie is just a fiction.Its meant for entertainment and they've did it best.Forget your brain and enjoy it"
" Has to be in contention for the worst movie ever.
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,2,"I'm a bit surprised with all the 10 * reviews. I mean even with giving it the benefit of doubt, no way this movie is over a 5 in any aspect. Some movies establish context before bending or breaking the laws of physics like the Matrix did. This movie did not bother with any of that. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie had no written script and the director just went on with scene after scene with whatever was playing in his head."
" The cringest movie I've seen in awhile
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,2,"I am seeing this movie for the first time after years it has been out, and I'm glad I never spent money on this. This movie was so ridiculous from start to finish and it was so cringey, I'm not sure how these actors willingly signed up for this movie. I know this is fiction, but it was so ridiculous I felt it was embarrassing"
" A decent sci-fi action flick
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,6,"Ah, another mass of reviews giving out ridiculous 1s and 10s.Lucy is a decent way to kill 90 minutes if you enjoy action and decent effects. I think the camera is fixed on Scarlett Johansson's static face for at least 20 minutes in total - so it's a good job she's pretty.It's a work of fiction, nobody should be caring about the 'science'; of course it's nonsense. This film is much like Limitless with superpowers thrown in."
" Great
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,8,"Lucy ""I've always wondered how life including creating creation worked as a kid, does nature have a heartbeat if you can't hear or see it?Could it be possible to have some form of power inside me, control everything and still live a normal life?I was blown away at the staggering capacity that was put to create the film that gripped me and no matter how much I was convinced that was it, WOW! There was more to come!So ask yourself, do you want see Lucy in action or think you've heard enough (don't answer that, watch the film)"
" And then you will know why are you living for.
",2019-05-17 00:00:00,9,"It's a spectacular movie with a fantastic script.
It's the mix of science and philosophy, which leads you to the meaning of life: share your knowledge.
Scarlett is superb, as always.
The photography, the effects and a ""bit"" of actions will keep you entertained, while you will think about how we are missing the full of us, using only the 10% of our brain.
What can we be at 100%? We will never know probably, but to watch the movie is a must. Both for scientific and philosophical believers.
And of course for you, cine lover :)"
" Lots of shooting & action. Not much of a plot
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,3,"This movie suffers from the same things that a lot of other recent films do: reliance on action, CG, and lots of explosive color. However, it fails in too many ways. Lots of foreign language with no way to know what's being said leaves the audience in the dark. Symbolism used but never explained, I didn't get a lot of it until I read the information on wiki explaining it. All this leaves a lot to be desired; the director and screenwriter have failed on a grand scale to tell their story. Any movie that you have to see multiple times to understand it, or need to read the director's explanation after watching it, is poorly written. As this is one of those, it doesn't qualify as decent entertainment as a movie. Perhaps it does as a puzzle. But most people don't want to go view puzzles without the information of how to put them together; in this way, this movie is like a jigsaw puzzle of a monotone piece of cardboard, cut up into a thousand pieces, so you have no way to figure out which piece goes where. Still, the light show was enjoyable to watch, much as a fireworks display is. But it's basically meaningless without knowing what it's supposed to represent."

" Lucy. In the sky!
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,10,"What a mind blowing film.
An independent film 'under the skin' showed Scarlett's Alien side, 'Lucy' shows her logical and philosophical side and 'ghost in the shell' shows her almost human side.
It's interesting to see how Luc Besson brought this film on to the screen after nearly 10 years of planning. Scarlett was the right choice for this project. It's good how she makes Lucy's humanity more Godly yet unforgiving.
One can not help noticing how she talks in a mono tonal voice through out as she appears not to struggle with her emotions, or lack of it.
Is this robotic phase a case where she has achieved immortality and emotions are irrelevant.
Over all I gave this movie a 10 because it is a difficult story to project to the audience on many levels and Besson did a good job.
Or we will end up thinking what is going on but like Kubricks 2001."
" Loved it until the end.
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,5,"The year is 2014. I've got a rare day off work, a free movie pass and figure a matinee would be a great way to pass a couple hours. So I look at what's playing and see ""Lucy"". It's a movie by Luc Besson which is good. I liked several of his movie. It's a movie starring Scarlett Johansson that I really liked. And the trailers for it looked interesting so I figured this was my movie.And like the title says I enjoyed it. There were aspects of philosophy, science, some kick ass fight scenes and then came the ending. There are very few movies in which the ending made me angry and this was one of them. They could have handled it in such a way that would have been better but they chose to end it the way they did. I felt cheated by it because it was such a let down.The story itself deals with the titular Lucy. She's a young woman who in order to make some money agrees to deliver a briefcase. But that's only part of the deal and she wasn't informed of the rest. Instead she's drugged and forcibly turned into a drug mule where this new synthetic drug is literally stitched into her and will be cut out when she reaches her destination. However one of the bags bursts and she ODs on it. Things get really strange and she starts to develop terrifying mind powers as she races to find a way to punish the people that did this to her and if there's a way to save her life.We're taken on a ride in which elements of science, philosophy and what it means to be human are explored. A lot of people criticize Scarlett's wooden acting but this is explained as being her having gone ""beyond"" emotion due to the drugs in her system. And then at some point near the end it just takes a hard left turn into something I just didn't care for. I can think of a half-dozen different ways they could have handled it and gotten the same kind of ending but as I said in the end it just fell apart and I felt cheated. Even though the movie itself didn't cost me anything, I still felt cheated.Personally see it for what it is and understand that the ending is really weak."
" Better Than Average Sci-Fi - Lucy
",2019-04-05 00:00:00,6,"Before viewing this film, I had a rather low opinion of Scarlett Johanson as an actress. Also, for the first ten minutes of the film, I was not really impressed with her performance because I figured she was a low-life playing a low-life in a film; not exactly a stretch. Then I was surprised by her range and acting ability. My opinion of her has changed radically. Morgan Freeman is always good; and he is good in this film as well. The story of a street girl who becomes the smartest person on the planet is entertaining, and the production values, although a bit violent, are first-rate. Some of the characters (like the Asian drug dealers) are stereotypes and cartoonish, but we forgive that because the general story line is very intelligent. Surprising to see someone resurrect their career with such an outlandish film."
" So bad I couldn't even finish it
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,1,"If you are going to give super powers by supposedly unlocking 100% of your brain atleast stop explaining it all the time why it works. It's so vexing and disrespectful to your audience. The morgan freeman sections belong in a biology lecture not a movie. All the dumb CGI is also needleesly long and boring.
There's also no character development because as soon as her body absorbs the drug she is instantly able to kill anyone, absolutely anyone regardless if they complete innocent bystanders.
I thought I would like this movie as I love Limitless, but this just takes the piss."

Based on a mix of real and disproven concepts stretched out to the farthest edge of your imagination.It explorers some very interesting concepts if even for a very short time, with bursts of spectacular visuals. Enough to get any science fiction and non-fiction fan to start thinking.It's also sexy, fun, and action packed. A very unique and enjoyable blend of genre's."
" This is a movie that should not be taken seriously at all.
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,4,"I watched this movie at the cinema back in 2014, and I just rewatched it on Netflix.
""Lucy"" is one of the most foolish movies in the history of film. At first this flick is easy to understand, but as the film continues it becomes more complicated with the double-talk and the false belief of why humanity exists and how humanity was brought into existence. This movie is all over the place, it's promoting Darwinism, Evolution, and the ten percent of the brain myth (which has never been proven, even scientists cannot prove this myth). As a strong in faith Christian, this film is basically like a comedy to me, with very good special effects. I give this a 4/10 rating because there are still some positive elements (no pun intended) there are some very decent performances, I like Scarlett Johansson as an actress her performances are always very well-acted in whatever role she plays, there are some good action scenes, and as someone who loves film music, the Score is fantastic, the mixture of electronic experimental and orchestral is different and is worth adding to a Playlist.If you still haven't seen this flick, I recommend it if you just want to be entertained, but if you are someone who is looking for answers as to the why when and how of the existence of the human race, then I don't recommend this movie, it will just lead you astray."
" Lucy Review
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,9,"After being beaten up by Taiwanese gangsters, the bag of blue crystals sewn into drug mule Lucy's (Johansson) stomach ruptures and leaks into her bloodstream, causing her brain capacity to surge. But as she enters superhuman realms, her tolerance for human weakness diminishes.
For half a movie, Lucy reminds you why you used to love Luc Besson. Not bothering with the rigours of set-up, we meet Lucy, a partied-too-hard student doing a last lap of Taiwan before shipping back to real life. She's sort of slutty: bottle-blonde hair, hooker skirt, and a week-long boyfriend (Borgen's Pilou Asbæk) who sure isn't a keeper. Scarlett Johansson, milking the contrast with the super-Lucy to come, plays the pre-transformation girl as likably wide-eyed and vulnerable, with just a hint of native savvy.Cajoled into delivering a suspect suitcase (how many innocent drop-offs include a handcuff?) to a Taiwanese syndicate, it takes only a few slick cuts before Lucy is up to her pretty neck in luridly tattooed wacko-gangsters with a bag of CPH4 - the latest in designer drugs heading for Europe's clubs, albeit one that has bypassed the trial stage - sewn into her stomach lining.Amid the film's ready supply of screwy science is the news that CPH4 is some kind of atomic-powered growth formula that, in quantum amounts, kickstarts the development of all the bones in a foetus. When the bag splits, in a flurry of CG fireworks, the cosmic cocaine smashes into Lucy's cerebral cortex, upgrading her from pitiful human levels of ten per cent brain usage towards the Stargate-crossing mystical hooey of 100 per cent capacity. In other words, upgrading Lucy from victim of male brutality into superhuman Lady Vengeance.For a blissful while, the film lands on a hyper-cool fusion of superhero gig and exotic thriller, with Besson mounting a series of divinely amoral, logic-be-damned sequences of lethal Lucy going about her brainiac makeover. Apart from taking out a penthouse of snarling hoods, this includes breaking into a hospital and forcing a doctor to remove the remaining CPH4 without anaesthetic while she uses his cell phone to call home.Meanwhile, leading brain specialist Morgan Freeman (only using five per cent of his total wisdom) expounds on the limits of the human brain and what might lie beyond - by 50 per cent capacity the laws of physics become your playthings. Using the X-Men register, Lucy develops into a slick-chick combo of Magneto, Mystique, Professor X and Quicksilver.Then, as literally mind-blowingly intelligent as Lucy becomes, the film crosses into ultra-cobblers. From that welcome self-homage to the sleek early Besson of Nikita and Léon, via the ultraviolent revenge-tragedies of Park Chan-wook (Oldboy star Choi Min-sik makes a suitably heinous kingpin), it freewheels into the quasi-philosophical sci-fi burbling of The Matrix as Lucy starts jacking into some higher state of consciousness - like Samantha from Her - and what was silly, sexy and fun becomes silly and pompous, consuming the stylish action in lumps of matter-tormenting CG. By the time Lucy is vaulting through time and space, things comes over all Terrence Malick (yes, you read that right), grandly pixel-painting the Big Bang, the dawn of life, and stopping off to gawp at an angry dinosaur. The last thing anyone wants is for this nonsense to mean something.
What keeps us watching, eager for the outcome, is the always scintillating star turn from Johansson, perfectly capturing the psychological plunge from foolish waif into a luscious-lipped, icy-eyed, femme-fatale Dr. Manhattan, moving beyond the constraints of morality, desire, fear and frailty into superhuman levels of pouting."
" Terribly cheesy but well-paced and comes to a compelling climax
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,6,"Terribly heavy-handed, from its pointless visual metaphors (the pursuing bad guy is the cheetah, Lucy is the antelope, wow, nice one) to Freeman's excruciating presentation (yes let's hear ""cerebral capacity"" said one more time, thanks) to its bad plot exposition (see Lucy mind-reading and saying what we already see). All of this said, it's got a good action-thriller pace, and the extremes it goes to with its concept in the end are actually pretty compelling (if still presented in a cheesy way).

This movie is really about Luc Besson bestowing a beautiful, stunning, and highly entertaining experience on us which also manages to be very thought provoking. If I had to compare with others by him I'd say it's sort of like Leon meets 5th Element. That means gorgeous eye-candy and stunning action-oriented performances. Yes, you ARE intelligent enough to disassemble its more out-there premises - but, why bother? Just enjoy the ride. You won't regret it.And BTW, the track heard over the outro credits is NOT on the Eric Serra CD (since he didn't write it!). Also, missing is the Mozart Requiem and ""Sister Rust"" (for the same reason) that set the perfect background for vital scenes. But they can be had if you search diligently, FWIW. They too are well worth seeking out. Just remember: Caveat Emptor."

",2019-03-14 00:00:00,8,"I agree that the ""science"" in this film is blatant babble science, but heck, this is *fiction* for heaven's sake! The ""science"" is only a plot device to create scenes in which to have fun! Imagine if we bring the same critical scientific criticism to classics like X-files, Travellers, or Fringe? Sure, in this movie, they took it *way* too seriously, but even over-the-topedness that can be considered entertainment. Anyway, setting the science critique aside, the drama was fun. Even the hokey way in which the story culminates is fun. You have to see it as tongue in cheek. It's only gob smackingly disappointing if you try to take it seriously.This applies even to the story line. After all, Lucy isn't faced with a whole lot of challenges that threaten her. Yeah, yeah, maybe time, but not even that, really, For her objective, there wasn't any need for her to find scientists. Maybe not from an internet cafe, but why not from the comfort of a more private household....."

The film Lucy produces a compelling and exhilarating experience. Lucy easily engages, and Besson creates an evocative world of Euro-Asian textures and action beats. Undergirded by classic themes and science fiction narrative layers, the film does not offer anything necessarily fresh in terms of its story; but it does produce a quick-moving and cleverly imagined piece of work."

I didn't know where this was going but suddenly I got very interested, and I was not disappointed... at first. But as the percetages rised I stopped getting into the story, with an unfortunately disappointing ending."
" Silly, but not boring.
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,6,"Writer / director Luc Besson is determined here to give us superhero-styled escapism stemming from some provocative ideas. The theme is that human beings really only use about 10% of their brains' full potential. So what if someone were able to tap into the other 90%? What would that person be able to do? What would they be like?Scarlett Johansson plays the title role, an ordinary average gal roped into an untenable situation by a guy she barely knows: deliver a mysterious briefcase to a Korean mobster named Mr. Jang (Min-sik Choi). The contents consist of a synthetic drug that supposedly allows users to tap into that aforementioned 90%. It's inserted into her system, and she becomes a rapidly evolving super-human who turns to an eminent professor (Morgan Freeman) and a badass cop (Amr Waked) for help.Ultimately, it's pure fantasy & fiction, and this viewer certainly wasn't expecting anything resembling a documentary. It's very fast paced (clocking in at a mere hour and a half), action-packed, over the top, and ridiculous as all-get-out. Nevertheless, it's fairly amusing on that level, with some violence & gore, and a plethora of digital effects work.Scarlett is easy to watch, as always, and her performance can be monotonous at times, but generally it's entertaining. Freeman again projects effortless quiet authority as the films' requisite brain science expert. Choi is a hoot as the unrelenting villain, and Waked is good as he injects a little dose of humanity into the proceedings.All in all, this is something of a hoot, one that doesn't require the prospective viewer to work their own brains that hard.Six out of 10."
" this is your brain on drugs
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,4,"Far from being just a ridiculous, terrible movie, this movie is an exciting view into the vast world of stupid that humanity can dream of. Putting aside that 10% of your brain myth underpinning the entire plot that has long since been debunked, there's just so many logical inconsistencies in this film that it's a little baffling that someone didn't catch at least some of them during the process of making a major blockbuster like this. But the real tragedy here is that I think there was a better film hiding underneath it all that could have been in more capable hands.Consider the start of the film, for example, wherein Scarlett Johansson's character Lucy unwittingly becomes entangled with a criminal syndicate. This is my favorite part of the movie because Ms. Johansson plays the role with with such visceral emotion. Her terror at finding herself suddenly and unexpectedly in the midst of a life or death situation is compelling. But already here there are some problems, like the absurdly public and unnecessary violence of the criminals. Of course, criminals can be violent, but even the most violent crime lords do their dirty work in the shadows or in guerrilla-style hit and run attacks, not brazenly on their front doorstep. Working that way would inevitably bring conflict with authorities (at least in first-world, developed nations) and spur public outrage, forcing even a corrupt government to confront the issue. But more than that, it isn't needed. Lucy is already oozing palpable tension and fear; the violence, if anything, relieves the tension by giving a face to her fear instead of letting the nameless dread wash over the viewer.The movie goes downhill really quickly after that. Basically, Lucy gains godlike abilities before we're 30 minutes into the film. This completely blows any tension or concern for her out of the water. She's become unstoppable, so why should we be concerned? Instead of gradually building her self-confidence and powers with us along for the ride, we watch her seize to be human in the first act. How can we relate anymore? The director seems to think that watching her plow through endless armies of bad guys will be entertainment enough, and maybe for some people it was. But I suspect most people would have liked to go on that journey of self-discovery with her, even if we had to worry about her well being a little along the way.Another major problem with the movie is that in a very real way, after Lucy is exposed to the magic smart drug--well, actually it isn't described as a smart drug at all but rather as a concentrated energy drug produced in limited quantities by pregnant mothers to give babies energy to grow; no explanation is given for why a super-powered Monster energy drink would make you smarter, but whatever. Anyway, after she is exposed to the drug, in a very real way we watch Lucy die and something else that only looks like her inhabit her body. Her personality is completely different. Before her exposure she's shown to be expressive and empathetic. After her exposure she is emotionless and cold, coolly executing many, many people including an innocent bystander who, she explains while dumping his body on the floor, had a terminal condition anyway.The audience is encouraged to believe Lucy is still the movies heroine, since most of her victims were bad guys. And I'm not saying that a hero can only have a batman-esque philosophy of no killing ever, but such a bloodless attitude towards what our society would describe as murder is far more indicative of an antagonist than a hero. Frankly, the movie would have been far more interesting if the focus had switched to destroying this man-made monster with unfathomable motives instead of worshiping a super powered sociopath. But it was the simple acceptance by the other characters of her actions that gave me the willies. Particularly since it is implied that Lucy is us evolved into some future, ideal state. What kind of messed up future do these writers dream of for humanity?Another problem I have with the film is this idea that the laws of physics and space and time really only exist, in some sense, because we believe they do. There is no level of intelligence that disables gravity or lets us push our fingers into someones skull and extract their memories. Yes, it's their universe and all that, but it just feels like such a lazy tool. They're not trying to create a world with magic, they just needed a way to show how her increased mental capacity allowed her to overcome all of these obstacles. And since they couldn't think of a series of actions that would accomplish that, they invented some magic mind powers to create a shortcut to their goal. It's lazy and stupid.Speaking of, I also have to take exception with their depiction of academia and science. In between Lucy's adventures, the movie also cuts to Morgan Freeman's character giving a presentation at some academic conference about the brain. He starts with that 10% myth, moves on to a complete non sequitur about cells and their environments that seems to be there only so the movie can make a callback to it later in reference to Lucy, and finally starts talking about what happens to humans accessing 20% and 40% of their brain (while also accidentally debunking his own speculation about what happens by referencing how dolphins already access 20% of their brains; where exactly are their crazy powers?).Now, I've been to a few academic conferences in my time and they can indeed be a forum for the free exchange of ideas and even some educated speculation about future possibilities. But here, when he just pulls these very specific notions out of his backside about what happens at each level of attainment (that sound more like a description of what happens when you level up in a video game than scientific research), the crowd just gazes at him adoringly and accepts his confession that he just made it all up without any follow-up comments. I guarantee you that would not be the response. Academics are a competitive, hard nosed bunch who almost relish the opportunity to pick the unprepared apart. Make a claim like that and then admit you just made it up and you would be in for a deeply unpleasant inquiry from your audience.Ok, I need to bring this crazy person rant to a close. Believe it or not, this is actually the much shortened list of my complaints, but I need to save something for my friends and family to really make them regret answering the phone, so I'll stop it here. Obviously, I didn't care much for the film, but I'll say this much: if you like Scarlett Johansson and enjoy special effects laden action films and don't care too much that it all make sense, then I suppose you could enjoy this film. Ms. Johansson does as much with the script as she can, I think, and the cinematography is quite good, as are the special effects and fight scenes. Also, I think I could see how some people would enjoy it as a kind of revenge film, particularly since one thing they do depict pretty well is the misogyny of the villains. But if it's the idea of a smart drug that interests you, I'd recommend Limitless with Bradley Cooper as a much better alternative."
" Could have been better without cinematic drama
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,6,"The main reason it was only 6/10 was because they sacrificed authenticity for cinematics. I hated the monotone, emotionless portrayal. Aside from that...Obviously suspension of disbelief is needed for a sci-fi, but there were things that just didnt sit right. For someone who's supposed to have ultimate knowledge, lucy did a lot of things that went against common sense. Small things throughout the movie that was just looked past, but just bothered me."

" Return of the 10% of the brain myth
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,7,"What's interesting, Luc Besson thought the myth was fascinating enough and hasn't been used sufficiently in other medias to make a new movie about it when it's been proven wrong already.
What this movie does well, it's starts a conversation about it for everyone who hasn't heard (enough) about it yet.
My first impression was that 'Lucy' is going to be a really bad movie, just existing so that Scarlett gets to be a Superhero as well, since in the Marvel movies she has no superpowers. But 'Lucy' is actually way more than that.
Especially the ending was interesting and even if the 10% statement is wrong, the movie could even work if they didn't involve the percentages. In it's state, it is a well portrayed adventure we get taken on and makes you question some aspects of life and your own potential and it's always great when a movie achieves something like this.
At the moment I feel torn about 'Lucy'. My thoughts went all across the board in the ratings, but in the end it is thought-provoking enough for a 7/10 and I would recommend it."

" A Nice, Action-Packed, Exciting, But Somewhat Empty Thriller
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,9,"7 February 2015. Lucy is science fiction based on the reflective speculation of what if a person could access 100% of their brain. Lucy refers to one of the earliest humanoids, who happened to be female, and also the name of the female star, played be Scarlett Johansson. She happens to befall a strange drug smuggling ring becoming the first person to begin to ""revolutionize,"" a term introduced by Morgan Freeman's character. In the process, Luc Besson has developed an sci-fi action thriller evolving mind, space, and time. The pacing is energized and the mental evolutionary conception of Besson is consistently brought to the screen. This is a rare movie in that upon repeated viewings, the power and consistent developing emotive and mental presentation brought to the screen by Besson and Scarlett is impressive.Thus action scenes sometimes become overly dramatic and fake looking, for the sample the car chase scene, even the initial transformation of Lucy is a bit over the top. Overall it seems that Besson;s attempt developing this progressively leaping mental concept that is satisfactorily captured on film. The Outer Limits' Five Fingers episode (1963) accomplished the same speculative venture in its television spot while Christopher Nolan accomplished a much more creative and meaningful spectacularly looking backdrop in his Interstellar (2014). Overall, Lucy is entertaining speculation that's fun to watch, with decent intensity and thrilling action that's worth to experience. Scarlett Johansson underplayed performance really stood out. Nicely done.Other classic movies that Lucy follows in the footsteps of Brain Storm (1983), Charly (1968), The Time Machine (1960), Time After Time (1979), and of course 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), and its contemporary, The Machine (2013)."
" It's an entertaining movie. Take it as that

And if you start to dissect into the scientific facts, then you are watching the wrong thing. Watch a scientific documentary instead.What this movie achieves is entertainment. You get a lot of action, a lot of science fiction and things that require a vivid imagination. But what I enjoy is that it makes us think beyond what we know and to break us out of the usual mode. And this movie achieves that.I haven't seen a more entertaining movie in a while and compared to a lot of what is out there, I'm surprised why this is rated so low."

",2019-01-10 00:00:00,3,"Why, why, why did the director have Scarlett Johansen jerk her head around like a robot and tilt her head for the entire movie. Yeah, we get it, this is her ""intelligent, computing"" look. Puleeeease. Was the movie geared towards first graders? Because that silly trope ruined the movie.
Also, her character is a hypocrite. While driving the cop's car and he complains about her killing him, she says ""we never really die"". Okay, then if she feels that way why is it so important for HER to survive? Makes no sense. Also she is a killer, as she kills countless people in car accidents that she causes.
In the end, she leaves humanity a giant computer filled with advanced physics, yes this humanity who still allows child abuse, child slavery, decimation of the planet, drug trade, murder, etc. Yeah, we deserve that and will handle it wisely, for sure!!! The movie is kind of a fun watch if you can not scream in frustration from Johansen's jerking head the entire movie through. The one part I liked was when she kissed the cute cop and told him that he would help her to ""remember"", so he was her link to being human. That was good."

" Lucy Review
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,10,"A fantasy about unlocking 100 percent of the brain's potential that expects viewers to be using just 2 or 3 percent of their own gray matter, Luc Besson's Lucy plays more like a big dumb superhero flick than sci-fi: The powers Scarlett Johansson gains when given full access to her brain quickly outstrip anything one can imagine 3 pounds of skull-bound neurons and synapses being able to do.
Besson's script offers neither the well-drawn character dynamics nor the clear motivations of a decent comic book origin story, and as it is quickly clear that no baddie has much chance of stopping Lucy, action sequences carry little weight. A top-shelf cast and the (fading) memory of Besson's action hits will help the picture at the box office, but word of mouth is unlikely to keep it alive long after a strong opening weekend.
Johansson's character begins as a party girl studying in Taipei whose new boyfriend (Julian Rhind-Tutt) is involved in bad stuff. Thanks to him, she winds up being an unwilling drug mule for Jang (Choi Min-sik, making the most of a role that forces him to speak through interpreters). A big bag of a superdrug called CPH4 is sewn into her guts, awaiting transport to new markets in Europe. But the bag springs a leak when Lucy is roughed up by her captors, entering her system in such quantities (cue fun CG shots of cellular-level transformations) that it activates huge chunks of cranial real estate she'd never been able to access before - like that little-known lobe that lets you turn off gravity when it suits you.
Helpfully, Besson has been cutting between Lucy's story and an academic lecture in Paris where researcher Samuel Norman (Morgan Freeman) has been hypothesizing about the very thing that is happening to her, making remarkably specific predictions about what might happen if humans were able to use more than the 10 percent we currently use (a myth, by the way) of the magnificent supercomputers in our heads. His ideas, like some of the film's other early scenes, are illustrated with cutaways to nature footage suggesting the ways in which all of Earth's creatures are interconnected, governed by the same laws. Think Luc Besson doing The Tree of Life.
The early stages of Lucy's transformation offer plenty of kicks and even a touching moment or two: After making her badass escape from Jang and his thugs, she struts into the nearest hospital's operating room, shoots the patient on the table - a glance at the X-rays told her the patient's brain tumor was inoperable - and has a surgeon pull out the remaining drugs planted inside her. Forgoing anesthesia, she borrows the surgeon's phone and calls her mother while he cuts her open, describing what's going on in her head. ""Mom, I can feel everything,"" she says as the camera almost imperceptibly rocks; sensations and emotions stretching back to her birth are available to her, triggering what proves to be almost the last human-like response she has in the film.
From here on out, Johansson's performance grows colder and more analytical. Besson doesn't let her become as persuasively alien as she is in Under the Skin, but he doesn't want a human, either. Lucy sets out to round up other batches of the drug and get to Paris, where she can let Dr. Norman see his theories in action. Why do this, one wonders, when in a matter of minutes she has already read his thousands of pages of research and surpassed his understanding?Plenty of films and novels have envisioned what would happen if we gained conscious control over our entire brain. While most would probably make a real neuroscientist cackle uncontrollably, it's hard to recall one whose ideas were more laughable than this one. We may roll with the film as its heroine learns Taiwanese over the course of a cab ride or sees the electromagnetic spectrum of cellphone calls, swiping through them as if she were reading their conversations on a touchscreen. We may even buy it when she's able to change her body at will - sure, growing a webbed hand would take some time and fuel, but at least a body's cells are controlled by its brain. But the film gives not the slightest justification for Lucy's increasingly godlike abilities, which soon include time travel and levitation. Every now and then, a nugget of real philosophy is dropped into the screenplay, but it's surrounded by so much blather that even a generous viewer has trouble using it to justify what Lucy experiences.Even more damning in an action film, Besson doles out powers in a way that nullifies much of the drama to come. Once we've seen this woman put an entire room of people to sleep with the wave of a hand, why would we be worried for her when a smaller gang is pointing guns at her? (And why wouldn't she just pull the same trick here, instead of wasting her time with showier and less believable feats?)
The movie occasionally attempts to make Lucy's quest accessible to mortal viewers. Though she doesn't need the assistance of a French cop named Del Rio (Amr Waked), for instance, she keeps him with her as ""a reminder"" of her fading humanity. But the reality-based action (a long, wrong-way trip through Paris traffic; a showdown with gangsters who want their drugs back) feels irrelevant to what the film really wants to show us. Unfortunately, though it concludes with a line suggesting Lucy has finally found all the answers, Lucy never tells us what the question is."
" Writer Luc Besson, famous for Taken and Leon turns Scarlet Johansson into Sarah Connor
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,7,"Lucy is a sci-fi, action movie written and directed by Luc Besson. The movie feels like it's split in two with the first half starting out fairly plausible and by the end of the movie grows into heavy CGI and sci-fi.Luc Besson is famous for Taken, Leon, The Fifth Element and The Transporter. He is a very good writer. This film leans more towards The Fifth Element in its levels of sci-fi and plausibility but I personally believe Leon and Taken are his masterpieces.The acting in the movie is good for an action movie, never likely to receive Oscar nods. I thought Min-Sik Choi was very good as the dictator boss and Morgan Freeman was his usual composed and impressive self as The Professor. Scarlet Johansson had some memorable scenes in the movie and she pulled off the change in her character superbly.The way the film shows the origins of humanity and the development of time, particularly in the end sequence is very impressive and well done.I was a little disappointed with the Soundtrack. I thought this movie could have done with something similar to the Drive Soundtrack or Tron...or even Terminator. Such distinguishable OST's from the action/sci-fi genre. But other than a few main scenes in the movie it lacked memorable backing.This movie is very similar to The Terminator and has elements of The Matrix. In fact, during many scenes in the movie I thought that Scarlet Johansson reminded me of and would have made a great Sarah Connor when it was remade.Overall, I would recommend this movie. It's an entertaining watch from a very creative writer and the plot is very interesting. 7/10"
" KNOWLEDGE IS GOOD
",2018-12-20 00:00:00,7,"I love science fiction when the emphasis is on science. If you love hype, special effects, gadgets, and a slightly different plot, this one has all of that. However, I have a hard time grasping the concept that special abilities such as manipulating time, space and dimension will happen when a person uses more of their brain.These type of films, of people who suddenly acquire special abilities is not new. The film gave me flashbacks of ""The Man with the X-Ray Eyes,"" ""Limitless"" ""Transcendence"", ""The Time Machine"" and ""2001..."" just to name a few. There are more.Lucy is given an experimental drug, CPH-4 that erupts in her abdomen and if you have seen one preview for the film, you know pretty much the whole film and have a good idea where it goes save the details.PLOT SPOILER: The scene that ties the film together is when she is back in time and meets our ancestor, a man-ape which reminds us of Dr. Leaky's ""Lucy."" Here, as in the painting of the Sistine Chapter our Lucy extends her finger, like God, to touch the finger of the man-ape. It was as if they created the whole film for this one scene. This was the equivalent of the man-ape touching the monolith in ""2001..."" Lucy imparts to man an unconscious universal knowledge (Hollywood New Age obsession) as would later be demonstrated with the painting of the Sistine Chapel and Dr. Leaky selecting the name ""Lucy"" and Faber College of ""Animal House"" using the phrase ""Knowledge is Good"" as their school motto.Unfortunately, the ending dragged on a bit, like a man entering a monolith. I was hoping for more face to face ""Kill Bill"" type action.Looks good on the big screen.Parental Guide: Minor swearing, maybe an F-bomb. No Nudity. Scarlett does get groped."
" Starts strong, falls apart.
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,4,"""Lucy"" starts out as an entertaining SciFi action flick. About halfway through it devolves into a SciFi mess that is heavy on the ""Fi"" and altogether missing the ""Sci"". Sadly, it ends so badly it makes the first half of the movie especially disappointing. How can something start good and somehow go so bad?"
" Misleading
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,4,"You'd think this was going to be an action flick, based on the trailers. It could have been, but it wasn't. This is especially odd since Luc Besson is usually pretty darn good at action flicks.Instead, we get...something that wants to be a deep philosophical film about the nature of humanity but lacks pretty much everything necessary.Scarlet Johanson does as well as can be expected given almost nothing to work with. Her work in the first half hour is great, but after that...not much you can do when your only direction is apparently, ""You're no longer human, you're a computer. Think The Vision with less personality, that's what we're aiming for!""Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman, used as exposition to give the audience the world-view necessary to make the plot work. It doesn't have to be true or scientific or proven; it's science fiction. The Force hasn't been proven and isn't based on solid science, but the Star Wars series is some pretty awesome sci-fi. Yet that first movie used a few lines of dialogue by Alec Guinness to set the stage; here we get Morgan Freeman pontificating and giving us far less than Obi-wan's explanation of The Force.The main problem with the movie is it lacks any form of sense or internal cohesion. Okay, using more of our brain gives humans power. Not a bad premise for a sci-fi flick. A flick of her finger knocks a precinct of cops out, but she has to levitate Asian bad guys one by one.And that's about it as far as action goes. The movie devolves into some sort philosophical art piece about the meaninglessness of being or something. There is literally no point to this movie. There's no plot resolution...or plot at all.So, final opinion...if you're a Scarlet fan, watch it but don't expect a reprise of Natasha. Just don't expect a plot that makes sense or any sort of meaning for the couple hours you spend staring at the screen."

" She-God Lucy
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,6,"Lucy is an okay movie that you maybe will enjoy.
I got tired of this movie and stopped caring about the movie the more it continued cause the movie just gets silly.CHARACTERS
All the characters are one dimensional ass hell.
Lucy had a personality for 30 minutes and den it all went away after she got the CPH4.
She is just this bland character with no personality and no threat is given to her.
She is this really smart person who can do telekinesis and other amazing powers who is fighting a group of koreans with guns so she doesn't face a big threat.
The rest of the characters that is in this movie are barely shown or even have a major importance to the movie cause Lucy just steals the spotlight.VILLAIN
I wouldn't call him a villain cause he has no major importance at all to the movie.
It's the group that has more importance to the movie and they dont give Lucy a threat.
There is nothing to say about anything when it comes to this movie cause Lucy is the only person with most screen time and when she doesn't have screen time it's about her.EXPOSITION
This is something really small but in the beginning of this movie when exposition was given then it was Samuel just talking and explaining what the plot was gonna be about.
There isn't a major problem with that but there could have been better ways to explain the plot.VERDICT
This movie is fine just don't expect much from it"
" Most unscientific film i have ever seen
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,1,"The notion that an average human using 10% of his brain is completely wrong . Also CPH4 do not increase brain capacity , infact its not even related to the brain. OK, let's ignore this, but I still found this film completely illogical .In the scene where CPH4 start showing effect for the first time , how did she gain that physical strength . She was supposed to use her brain more than ever but has nothing to do with power. In an another scene, she removes a bullet from her shoulder without feeling any pain, means if you can you 70% of your brain you will not feel any kind of pain. Seriously? Then, she can see all the mobile waves traveling in the air with naked eyes and can even zoom it. The screen writer thinks you can do anything if you can use 100% of your brain. You will literally become God.Another dumb scene was in which Lucy explains to the scientists that numbers are just creation of our mind and does'nt physically exist. Like all those scientists are dumb and not already knowing that. And how come Lucy has gained so much knowledge. Brain capacity and knowledge are two different things .
This film is far, far away from Logic ."
" LOVE this movie

Seriously I have multiple thoughts in my head & this movie just added more... I know I'm stupid in a lot of ways, but the way my brain works almost seems more like a quantum computer over a PC, or MAC. I just don't know how to control, or tap into it."

" pleasant
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,7,Scarlett Johansson was breathtaking. Morgan Freeman master crafted into a work that will be followed by a pleasure to follow
" Long on fiction, short on science
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,7,"""Lucy"" is more wish fulfillment fantasy than anything else. Wouldn't be great if we all had God-like powers locked away in our brains just waiting to be released (kind of a metaphysical version of a letter from Hogworts). Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) experiences this cognitive renaissance when she is forced to mule an experimental drug hidden in her abdomen by a vicious Taiwanese drug-lord. The drug, a synthetic prenatal hormone, allows her to vault past human (and physical) limitations and archive 'The Highest Possible Level of Development'. She eventually meets up with Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) a pseudo-scientist and expert on the quiescent 90% of our brain while an army of the nattily dressed gangsters search for her. A massive gunfight (borrowing heavily from The Matrix) accompanies a trippy extra-corporal experience (borrowing heavily from the 2001: A Space Odyssey). Energetic and entertaining, ""Lucy"" is best enjoyed using only the right-side 5% of your mental capacity, but if you have read some of the many fawning reviews on IMDB and expect to achieve enlightenment, I suspect that you will be disappointed."
" So bad I watched it 12 times
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,10,Stellar performance by Scarlett Johansson. Amazing special effects. Raw vengeance and cleaver concepts. My only regret was the fate of Lucy in the end but I guess it was essential to the story line. I love the way Lucy brings the vengeance.
" Science and action!!!
",2018-07-17 00:00:00,7,"I saw this movie earlier this evening and I was empressed. The movie mixes in some science with action and the two big stars, Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman, are great. Analeigh Tipton's brief part was a scene stealer all the way. A great movie to watch on a Monday night."

" Boring
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,2,"This is the worst science fiction movie I've ever seen. I've seen better B movies than this. It relied only on CGI. The acting was terrible, and when Lucy became ""super woman"" she also became creepy, with staring blank eyed and no expression. Most of the film was special effects, or too much of the gangsters, car chasing and shooting. When Lucy became that Super Woman she was callous, for speeding a car through a busy public city and causing car crashes everywhere. Reminding one of the ""nobody"" scientists about his deceased child was very sad and pointless. Lucy travelling in time was perhaps the only excitement but then she turned into a massive oily blob at the end, disappeared, and said ""I'm everywhere"". The whole film was just crap. So according to whoever made this one, gaining too much info makes people bigger jerks that never smile."
" Review Nr 1000:A bizarre mix of guns, Scarlett Johansson and Einstein's relativity theory.
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,7,"Seen this sci fi gun flick before, remembered it as a ludicrous incredible story. That is true. But if you look at it from another point of view then this movie can still be enjoyable. It sure has got speed, action and suspense.The weakest point however is the impossible ludicrous story. What is the ludicrous story about? Scarlet Johansson becomes a forced drugmule at gunpoint. The drug she carries however accidentally gives her superhuman capibillities, that is the ludicrous part of this story. How ludicrous? Well, she can melt with machines, she can stop bullets, travel through time back to the dinossaurs. Ludicrous enough? Still there is something to be applauded for in this picture and that is it's guts. It dares to try mix a normal gangster movie with vague scifi nonsense. And surprisingly enough I watched it till the end, however bizarre and plain stupid the story was. Normally I really dislike implausible stories, let alone this kind of bizarre time travel story. But somehow director and writer Luc Besson pulled it off. It could have been better though with a more credible story, now it is merely a good action packed scifi B movie."
" Purports to be an intelligent film about unlocking the potential of the brain; the irony isn't lost on me.

To make matters worse, the feature ends, in a final slap directly from the director to our severely-underestimated intellect, by the central character using all of her brain power to... turn into a USB stick. I'm not joking, but I wish I was. 4/10"
" So bad!!!
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,1,A complete waste of time. Depressing and sombre movie with ridiculously implausible plot. Kept watching it thinking how much worse can this get?
" Mediocre at best.
",2018-04-04 00:00:00,6,"Nothing special to say about this movie. It just lost it's tracks as the movie went on, it became too much unreal, too much confusing, unlogical, delusional. As some other reviewer said before me, Limitless dealt way better with this idea than Lucy did. I liked the concept, but in this case it was badly executed."
" A typical idea that set that bar for its fiction to the absolute max
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,7,"I love science. Naturally, I didn't like the extremely non-scientific idea at first too. I remember when the movie came out and people were like ""well people do have limited access to their brain so you never know!"". Absolutely hated that. But should my opinion on the movie be influenced my such unscientific opinions? NO! It's a movie for crying out loud! And generally, your opinion should not be influence by who supports a certain idea. I'm no expert so I'll keep it simple. The movie starts brilliantly. Scarlett proves once again she is not just beautiful. Enjoyed the directing, cameras, etc (with my very limited knowledge).What I loved about the movie was that it took the sci-fi idea of the ""100% brain access"" (such as Limitless) and shredded it to pieces; there's nothing beyond this, and I doubt there will ever be. Some might (reasonably) argue that the end was too much. Ok, yes it was, but that was the point; no movie will ever be able to take this idea to a more extreme level ever again. Plus, it was the only ending that not everyone would expect; anything ""weaker"" and you'd be like ""pff the ending was casual"".On the downside, as we approached the end of the movie, it became a bit irrational, even in its own world. Sometimes even forced. Moreover, the constant attempt to make it sound scientifically possible throughout the movie made me cringe. But I guess I should have been more prepared for this."
" Awful

It was the first time I watched a movie with this kind of plot and it was a good surprise for me. I also liked the direction which was made by Luc Besson because I believe he did a great job and it can be easily understood from the whole duration of it. The interpretations of Scarlett Johansson who played Lucy and Morgan Freeman who played Professor Norman were simply amazing.To sum up, I have to say that ""Lucy"" is a good and interesting movie with which you are going to have a great time.

" stupid, stupid, stupid
",2018-02-22 00:00:00,2,"Violent and unpleasant movie built around two truly stupid ideas : a) the idea that normal humans use but a tiny part of their brain and b) the idea that one can become really, really, really intelligent by taking designer drugs. In fact, taking designer drugs won't simply make you smart : you will be able to levitate, fly, build revolutionary computers, travel through time and space, read minds, render yourself invisible ! It's very reminiscent of the old joke about the little boy asking for tampons as a birthday gift, because with tampons you can do everything you would like to do - go swimming, play tennis, climb mountains, and so on.A small question : have you ever heard of ""endocrine disruptors"", chemical substances disrupting the hormone system of both animals and humans ? Such disruptors are, or can be, present in all kind of household products and plastics, such as cosmetics, food containers (think meals to be heated or reheated in the microwave), baby toys, packaging, and so on. Studies have linked the presence of such endocrine disruptors to serious threats to human health, including a diminished intelligence in descendants. Even if only part of these fears turn out to be true, then we're facing a health crisis of stupendous scope and gravity, for which thousands and thousands of innocents will be paying the price. And while we're at it : a general lowering of the IQ is precisely the thing that causes the collapse of a civilization. As a result we're talking about an existential threat.Now here's the strange thing : if you go to a major studio and say something like : ""I dream of making a big budget blockbuster, with stunning stars, about the link between environmental pollution and human health and about the danger to our children's intelligence"" there is every chance of being laughed out of the office. In fact, there is every chance of you being escorted from the premises by security guards. And yet there is money and interest to be found for random nonsense such as ""Lucy"". Upon reflexion, perhaps this DOES prove that homo sapiens only uses part of his brain..."

He says ""only 1/5 of it is science"". REALLY? What has he been smoking? This movie makes absolutely no sense, it's completely irrational from the very start to the last scene.

Suspicions started to boil during the sluggish first dialogue and the following crude montage of nature clips. From then on I knew this was popcorn. Despite it's ridiculous premise and pretentiousness i was still entertained somewhat. The movie quickly goes so overboard that you can't but laugh at all the fast-paced madness that unfolds. If it hadn't taken itself so serious it might have worked. Now it's just a failed attempt at making a good philosophical sci-fi action flick.

",2018-02-04 00:00:00,9,"Unless you are nearly brain dead, you will find this film stimulating. If you are a sci-fi buff like me, even more so. A film like this reminds me of how starved some of us are for films of this sort. This film was brilliantly directed by the French Maestro. Beautifully acted, by Scarlotte Johansson. While the transformation is happening, we see Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman) giving a lecture on the capacity of the human brain. He says people generally use only about 10 percent of their brain's capacity. (Yes, it's an urban legend, but you'll enjoy the movie a whole lot more if you ignore that fact and just go with it.) Norman, an authority in this field, has no idea his path will soon cross with Lucy's.Lucy accidentally ingests the drug and her neurons begin firing. Her brain begins to grow ever-more powerful - so powerful that she's able to easily disarm any captor and figure a way out of any situation she's in. She needs someone who understands brain function to help her while a team is hot on the trail to dispense with her. The film moves at such a frantic pace and provides such mind-boggling visuals and fascinating concepts about time and existence that it's impossible not to be entertained. Besson also throws in some brief but exhilarating nature scenes to emphasize Lucy's vulnerability (at first) and then to expound upon what she is learning.Somewhat improbably, it's also an ideal culmination of a sci-fi trilogy Johansson may not have even realized she was making. In Her, Under the Skin and now Lucy, the 29-year-old veteran has not only delivered some of the finest work of her career, she's found a trio of characters in conversation about what it means to be human through the eyes of an outsider, be it artificial intelligence, alien or an accidental superhuman. In fact, it's near impossible to imagine Lucy without Johansson and her perfectly calibrated performance, a crucial component to investing in the story's inherent silliness.The action was a little over the top at times. The Chinese gangsters were perhaps a metaphor for the Chinese Politburo. Perhaps the world's ultimate criminal organization, that will stop at nothing to achieve it's ends. What you'll find here, is a well-crafted science fiction yarn that might make you think more than you bargained for while you enjoy the shoot-ups and vehicle crashes."
" ""Limitless"" was far better
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a complete Turkey.
The premise of the mind enhancing illicit drug is far better explored in the 2011 movie ""Limitless""."
" ""If Lucy be lousy...""
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,2,"(Title is Shakespeare, FYI.) And, yes, Lucy is lousy. I'm sure a million reviews here have had a blast with the ridiculous '10% of the brain' premise. Personally, my objections (also likely share by many) go to: Morgan Freeman. ENOUGH. We know you're the go-to God figure and it's extremely tired. Then, and worse, is the irritating shift in style. The audience putting up with the pseudo-science-spirituality garbage has the right to expect that Lucy will spectacularly kick the bad guy asses at the end. But, noooo. Instead, Lucy, who could in a heartbeat save a bunch of lives, goes time travelin'. Most annoying of all is the 'Contact' nonsense about how humanity may not be ready for so much knowledge. Ya think? Ultimately, this is way pretentious bilge."
" MADE BY ALBERT EINSTEIN HIMSELF
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,10,"This is a movie essentially about Scarlett Johannson or whatever her name is being so unbelievably smart she turns herself into a f***ing USB Flash Drive by way of... Psychokinesis? Extrasensory Perception? Some other third force of using 100% of your brain?Seriously, this movie isn't focused on the journey of Lucy. It's specifically about Scarlett Johannson turning into a U-S-B- F L A S H D R I V E. 10/10 movie I liked it when she remembers what her mothers titty milk tasted like."
" Unique and pretty awesome!
",2018-01-12 00:00:00,8,Deep and philosophical are two words that personally describe a great movie for me. Lucy fills in those boxes and more. A slow start but a great and questionable ending is why I give this movie an 8/10.
" Missed the mark
",2018-01-08 00:00:00,4,"I'm a big Besson fan, Le Grand Bleu and The 5th Element are amongst my most favorite movies. I feel like the director (and writer) really missed the mark on Lucy. Even with the prerequisite suspension of disbelieve, there are so many holes in the plot, there is no character development and too much gratuitous violence. It's ok for a director to take a risk and fail, but this feels more like laziness and uninspired work. While there is a some redeeming entertainment value, this movie misses the mark of what could have been a true classic in that genre."
" Not horrible, but certainly not a memorable sci-fi film
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,5,"How best to explain 'Lucy'? I'm not really sure - my best bet is 'Limitless' crossed with 'The Matrix', but without the best bits from either! Basically, Lucy (Johansson) gets involved in a drug ring in Taipei and it just so happens the drugs 'unlock' the full potential of her brain. The biggest flaw of the film is right there - it's based on the urban myth that humans only use 10% of their brain power. We may not always use 100%, but we certainly use more than 10% for the majority of the time!The best bits are the amazing car scene in Paris, the intercut footage (cheetahs, dinosaurs and other bits of nature) and Morgan Freeman. Unfortunately, that's more than counterbalanced by the fact that the film struggles to make 90min, has a lack of actual action/excitement has a huge cop-out ending and Johansson acts like a robot, which is apparently what a hyper-evolved human would be like?!?Considering Besson made 'The Fifth Element' - one of the more fun, inventive Sci-Fi films of the last 20 years - it's a shame this film is neither fun, nor original. I definitely think the filmmakers thought they were being far more philosophical than they actually ended up being."

Please drop me your comments!
I have seen with great interest the movie that was premiered this week (1.12.17)in our nationwide commercial TV movie channel Star that in the very start was marked as U-rate whiCh later was corrected into PG. necessary parental guidance
The movie starts very rogue with unnecessary violence Lucy M was pressed by her boy friend to deliver a handbag with CPH4 a chem. essence inside a plastic bag as a new drug The gang kills him . Among other 4 persons she got a surgery The bag was planted iside her body aimed to transfer this essence to a target .CPH4 was leaked inside her body resulting into an increase of her minds potential first to 20%. and gradually increasing. The boss then wanted to stop her. .. while she wanted to know on what can happen to her life and take revenge against the gang...
Movie was full of action with very fast pacing with many poor visual effects from just typical metaphysics and telecom effects(goof!) to time travel in 100%(possibly not goof .
Very good drama with lots of suspense and very simple plot . Scarlet leads the film wih her good play while Morgan is nearly useless.
Action plot and run4/5
Now on the background :The writer is totally ignorant in basic physics and scientifically full of holes in favor to suspense and action.
The main point CPH4 is a real ingredient in pregnant mothers. There are many sites including Quora that probe these allegations and Benson knows that. Many sites refereed to this ingredient and the facts behind that and the movie.
I have some very good knowledge in radio and limited in metaphysics paranormals and neuroscience that help me to go in depth of the writer's ignorance: Some new researches show that we use our full brain. Lucy with in just 20% learnt Korean and Chinese, fully memorize 6500 pages from a teachers works ,excelled in shooting with a gun, drive without knowledge at her first time as Shumacher (haha!),do telekinesis, deactivate others minds (min control poss. not goof ), read distant people's minds (possibly not goof) but also control radio frequencies mobiles and TVs and map the radio spectrum to identify the communication frequency between the Koreats and then listen to them from the... police transceiver!
Really ? How can she faultlessly drive at so very high speed as the best car racer without any previous experience ? How can she map the entire spectrum? ?How could she decode the digital coding format of mobiles ?showing reach of 00s is stil a wrong excuse. Both GSM bands were digitally encoded using TDM.
And finally in the end of the movie before starting the final experiment, well aware of the gang outside the experiment room and with more than 70% MR e she could really remotely neutralize all of them with just a simple thought or even kill them. Why she expected the police to do that? this proves she is idiot.
And finally Lucy taking the role of God!!! haha...
It is clear that Benson wanted to favour action and suspense at the expense of everything other (logic and some basic physics) and become troll.
In a way to troll against his audience with the 'nonexistent background adn get ridiculed.Therefore: He had to do a lot more side research before making stores full of goofs.
Scientific Background :1/5 except possibly the paranormals .that get the 1Anyway i watched it for second time the next day for looking again the goofs. It was recorded as the time aired was too early 9pm the time my 8 yo daughter was playing with her friend in the house. I m sure to watch it several times again mainly for laughing a/o analyzing the movie more ."
" Another perspective
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,7,"Giving all the intelligence aspect it must be appreciated for looking into it in that way, in other words stupidity prevails. Loved the montage work the prestige of the actors. and come on it is a Sci-Fi. where is the harm in attempting to prove one more time that people are still complicated but stupid enough to see that."
" ""Time is the only true unit of measure. It gives proof to the existence of matter. Without time, we don't exist.""
",2017-11-22 00:00:00,7,"Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) gets mixed up with a group of ruthless drug smugglers. Still trying to process what's actually going on, she wakes to discover the smugglers have sewn a packet of a new drug into her stomach. Before she can deliver the drugs, however, the packet busts open, releasing the powerful drug into her system. The drug's effect is an ever increasing utilization of her brain. Soon, Lucy is capable of manipulating matter and energy with her mind. She contacts a renowned scientist for assistance. She realizes that the drug will kill her within 24 hours and she wants to pass on the knowledge she's gained. But the smugglers are intent on getting their drugs back. They follow Lucy half way round the world for a final showdown.Overall, Lucy is a fantastically entertaining film. The action is nice with plenty of fights, gun battles, and car chases. The direction from Luc Besson couldn't be much better. He keeps things moving at a very lively pace. The acting is also superb. Scarlett Johansson proves once again that a woman can be successful as the lead in an action oriented film. And Johansson does an excellent job portraying the changes to Lucy as the drug changes her brain. Nicely done. The supporting cast is also solid. I particularly enjoyed the performance of Amr Waked as the bewildered French policeman who helps Lucy in her journey. Another highlight for me has to be the special effects. Just amazing. Finally, even though things do get a bit messy and even rushed toward the end (this is my biggest complaint), I still had fun with it. The time travel bits were especially moving.I really like and appreciate the message I got out of Lucy. Being a father of two boys and getting older each day, I too sometimes feel that the only real commodity of any value that I have is time. Time to spend with my wife and kids, time to do things I enjoy, time to live my life - that's what's important. It's not material objects or anything else. It's the limited time we each have on this Earth.Finally, if you read comments on Lucy, you'll sooner rather than later run into criticism of the scientific errors made by the film. People love to point them out. I honestly didn't have any problem with the film's scientific realism. It's a movie - I wasn't expecting a science lesson. I accepted the scientific mumbo-jumbo just as I would in any sci-fi film. In the reality in which the films is set, it all makes sense. In our reality, it doesn't. I went with it and didn't let it affect my overall entertainment."
" A proper action-sci-fi romp
",2017-11-17 00:00:00,7,"Better mention straight away that I'm a hardened sci-fi buff and often critical of films in the genre.As opposed to some of the sci-fi block busters the latter years, this one makes no pretense to, uhm, be pretentious. Neither is it filled with the now popular faux soulful ""scientists"" that more often than not come off as soppy morons. This is a wild ride for the senses of wonder. Like some fun loving reviewers note, it's not at all trying to be scientifically correct - it's heavy on the fiction and demands of the viewer that you let go, sit back and enjoy the ride.I'll quote fellow reviewer thuffman-219-557602 who said it in simple and clear terms: ""Bad-*** car chase, science-fiction, sex appeal my goodness, Morgan 'the man' Freeman, Chow Yun-Fat worthy shootout, visuals that will blow your-effing-mind, and it didn't even take 2 sequels and a prequel to do it."" I reckon it's natural that this is by the creator of Leon - don't actually expect another Leon though, this is Luc Besson doing something different. Neither should you expect deep character development or carefully pondering concepts in this express train of a movie.In summary, the action is good and unrelenting, the sci is perhaps more fantasy than science, but still entertaining if you let it be, and the fi ranges from gritty to moments of almost Olaf Stapledon wondrous."
" Evolution
",2017-11-15 00:00:00,8,"is one of the best movies about evolution that I've seen but to understand it you have to pay attention from the beginning as always Scarlet did an amazing role also Morgan did as always amazing, I recommend it for those who like to talk about where we came from, how the planet Earth was created."
" Good but not enough
",2017-11-10 00:00:00,7,"to be honest; the movie is prepared with the really good scenario, but the effects really was inadequate. the effects were really bad especially at the end. apart from that, the subject is beautifully rendered. in general if we think that 7 points was a film that deserves to. compared to limitless, it's a poor film according to it."
" This movie tries desperately to be philosophical, but it fails.
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,4,"SPOILER ALERTThe movie starts off great, with good acting and a plot that makes sense. Then, after ~ 40 minutes, the main character turns into a zombie and the movie becomes lifeless, predictable and boring. Admittedly, there are some good action scenes in the 2nd half of the movie, but they are of no importance to the plot.So, what is the plot? Lucy is accidentally given drugs, which enables her to use more of her ""cerebral capacity"" and ultimately turns her into God: When she travels back in time, she touches the finger of the first man, just as God does in Michelangelos fresco.This is no coincidence; this very fresco is shown earlier in the movie. At the end, we hear Lucy saying,""Life was given to us a billion years ago. Now you know what to do with it.""Does Luc Besson want to tell us that we should try to become God, too? This makes no sense, since Lucy never wanted to take the drugs and become God. While becoming more and more godlike, Lucy loses all her social skills, her empathy, her emotions. During only one car ride, she probably kills hundreds of people, just because she is in a hurry. Does this mean that God is cold-hearted, without empathy and doesn't care about life? Lucy says, ""we never really die"". Even if that is true -- does that legitimate to destroy hundreds of lives? One death affects more than just one person.The other characters were absolutely irrelevant. Lucy reads all of Samuel Norman's ""research"", but after that he is of no help to her whatsoever. His philosophical words impress no one, Morgan Freeman is wasted on this role. The only thing he does is tell us at the very beginning what is going to happen in the movie. He tells us that, when we unlock more cerebral capacity, we gain control over us, then others, then matter. A student asks,""But what if, for some reason we ignore, somebody unlocked 100% of their cerebral capacity?""My first thought was that we would become God, since it is almost the only thing left. I was very disappointed to find out I was right. There were no plot twists and no surprises. There was no character development, only character degeneration. At the end, Lucy becomes transcendent and ubiquitous, the ultimate step of becoming God.Close to the end when the environment turned white, I realized how much this movie resembles The Matrix. Sadly, this movie can't compare to The Matrix in ANY way."
" I liked it
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,7,"I had never heard of this movie until it was recently shown here on TV. Scarlett Johansson unwittingly gets transformed into some kind of super hero and sets out on a violent revenge against the gang of Chinese drug dealers who abused her. Simple but very entertaining. The film moves at a fast pace, plenty of violence & special effects, good cast & is set in China & France, so interesting locations. And Scarlett looks HOT as ever...."
" Lucy is Another Limitless But coated in Theory of Evolution
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,6,"Theory of Evolution Charles Darwin twitched his contemporaries with so-called ""compelling"" evidence in his 1859 book ""On the Origin of Species"", presenting counter defense for his theory of evolution. Core of his theory was based on concept of ""Natural Selection"" according to which ""species act to preserve and accumulate minor advantages in result of genetic mutations. Suppose if a member of a species developed a peculiar functional advantage such as wings and learns to fly, its offspring would inherit same advantage and pass it on through process of reproduction. In simple words, natural selection is the preservation of a functional advantage that enables a species to compete better in wild and seemingly inferior and disadvantaged members of the same species would gradually die out.""Director Before dissecting new sci-fi thriller ""Lucy"" it was necessary to give readers a small bite of theory of evolution which has been inspiring Hollywood directors throughout cinematic history. Director of ""Lucy"" Luc Besson is no different. Luc Besson is the same French director who touched the fame in Hollywood tinsel town with Bruce Willis starer ""The Fifth Element"" in 1997. He has its expertise in telling sci-fi stories but with ""Lucy"" he has gone nose deep explaining Darwin's ""theory of evolution"" with high octane car chase sequences on streets of Paris and same time predicting about possibilities if someone, by chance, gets capability of using 100% of his or her cerebellum capacity. Using 100% of brain capacity does not seem an idea which has never been exploited by Hollywood. Fans of sci-fi adventure movies have already seen similar idea in Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro starer fabulous movie ""Limitless"" in 2011 but in ""Lucy"" Luc Besson has tried to explain similar concept in a grand manner. Plot The plot of the movie revolves around a blond American girl name Lucy (Scarlet Johansson) who is trapped in the middle of horrific drug deal by his boy friend. She was forced to deliver a case filled with some highly advanced lab drug to dangerous mafia boss Mr. Jang (Minsik Choi – Old Boy, I Saw The Devil). She is further dissected and filled with same drug in her abdominal by Mr. Jang's men to make her a conduit of delivery to his clients. Because of torture during her captivity packet of drug in her body leaks to the maximum level and creates some chemical reaction after mixing with her DNA and results super ability of using her brain to exceedingly optimum level. With her newly gain super power she contacts Professor Norman (Morgan freeman) who has done extensive research on concept of utilizing human brain more than 10% which is the maximum level to date. Mixing of drug in high quantity in her body gives Lucy limitless powers to see beyond the existing and visible world. Due to her possible death in result drug she was advised by Dr. Norman to see and record evolutionary process of human being from single cell to multi-cellular organism. Performances ""Lucy"" is filled with multi-star cast from Hollywood, France and Korea. As mentioned above main lead has been performed by beautiful Scarlet Johansson. She has brilliantly displayed both shades of naivety and fearlessness. As far as Hollywood reverend Mr. Freeman is concerned, it seems he has become an integral part of every movie with similar concept. Oblivion, Transcendence and now Lucy Mr. Freeman has not shown slight diversion. Along with fast paced action the other USP of the ""Lucy"" is performance of Korean actor Min sik Choi who has given not surprisingly fantastic performance without speaking a single word of English in whole movie. His ruthlessness as mafia boss and drug dealer is worth to be witnessed. Conclusion Lack of novelty in story is big minus of the movie but unique style of storytelling by Luc Besson, execution and performance of Min sik Choi make ""Lucy"" worth of repeat watch."
" It just gets worse the more I think about it
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,3,"Now, I love movies and I have seen plenty worse than Lucy but for some reason this movie just rubbed me the wrong way and I found myself getting genuinely mad as I watched. This movie stars Scarlet Johanson as Lucy who, early on in the movie is kidnapped and used as a drug mule for this drug that enhances people to use 100% of her brains capacity and, after it gets into her bloodstream, it allows her to do all kinds of supernatural things. Plenty of people have a problem with this premise and I don't really. The film Limitless deals with a similar subject and (although Limitless handled it better and more realistically) I could suspend my disbelief for this premise. And after this moment the movie begins to fall apart. First off I was baffled by some of the director's choices in this movie. A situation would occur and it would suddenly cut to a 'symbolic' show of a similar situation happening in nature like a mouse walking towards a trap or cheetahs stalking prey. And it just seemed so... Pretentious. I get what's he's saying but there was not a hint of subtly in this symbolism. And the whole script just seems so convinced it's being new and groundbreaking it forgets to be any of those things. Stuff just happens, it'll display some impressive visual effect with no explanation of what, how or why and you can tell we're supposed to be amazed saying ""what does it all mean?"". I'll tell you what it means: nothing! There are plenty of other annoyances in the movie, Morgan Freeman's inclusion is pointless, the ending just seems preachy and uneventful. It seems like we're watching everything unfold with no stakes or consequence, and that brings me to my main complaint. Lucy is boring and empty because there are no stakes in anything going on. As soon as she gets these powers there is no conflict or competition. People chase her with guns and try to fight but none of it matters, she can just knock out a whole room without any resistance. We are never told her limitations because she has no limitations, she has no threat. Resulting in her character being boring, undeveloped and leaves all the side characters on the side line because there's nothing they can do in this situation. She's so powerful she needs no help and has no competition resulting in the side characters useless and all of the action scenes are boring and unsuspensful. Lets also not forget how Lucy is a terrible person once she takes the drugs, before she was quirky, Scarlet Johanson played her well but as soon as she becomes a god she is just dangerous. She shoots an innocent cab driver in the leg because he doesn't speak English, drives recklessly and even kills a man while he's being operated on because he apparently 'couldn't be saved anyway'. Nice protagonist writing there. And the ending... Oh my god. The ending. I won't spoil anything, mainly because there's nothing to spoil. After all of the efforts and 'conflict' in this movie amounts to nothing and the movie ends as if it's taught us something so deep but all I learned I wasted two hours of my life watching NOTHING If I were you, I'd skip this one but if the premise interested you I recommend Limitless starring Bradley Cooper. It's much better than whatever this tried to be"
" An amazing, smart, action packed joy ride!!!!
",2017-10-03 00:00:00,10,"First off, this is one of the best written, choreographed, acted and thought-out movies I have seen in a long time! The action is intense but so are the mind bending philosophical quandaries and scientific/pseudo-metaphysical theory busting propositions/hypotheses.... I feel like this movie may be too much for some people to wrap their brains around but it has such great effects and fight scenes it could probably keep a teenager occupied for the full hour and a half (if their parents let them watch it). This movie can be compared to others but aren't most movies nowadays ramped up contrivances of past scripts and monologues????!!!! The idea of this movie reminds me of James Bond movies, Jackie Chan movies and the movie Altered States. It has a little bit of everything for everyone (except young kids). Though, if you don't like action, Scarlett Johansson, surreal ideas or Morgan Freeman, you might not like this movie."
" Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,2,"Written and directed by Luc Besson with Scarlett Johansson in the lead role and Morgan Freeman with the same performance as always, that is, he does not even need to act, he just needs to be Morgan Freeman. Lucy (Scarlett) suddenly sees herself as a ""mule"" in a drug business; when the drug breaks free inside her body she undergoes a transcendent transformation, that is, she does not get ""high"", she does not get ""stoned"", she does not die from ""overdose"", she only ""trips a little"" and in due time manages to use all the functionalities of her brain up to 100%... to beat the crap out of the bad guys. ""So what about all the knowledge and wisdom that comes from such an advanced mind to help humanity?"", you ask. Well, that's really not needed, because now she can satisfy her thirst for blood (or that of the viewer) by being some type of super-ninja with super-powers inside the Matrix, in a race against time before turning into a super-quantum-D-Wave-type computer that self- destructs when Freeman pulls out a pen drive that contains the knowledge that can lead mankind to the next level of evolution. Besson, listen to me: stay off the drugs.Bad premise, bad sci-fi, neither science nor fiction are credible. But some people will guarantee you that this is an inspirational film and that it is thought provoking... go figure!!! Evolution my a**!!! 2 stars because effects... affects brain, hurts... shutting down... I'm nowhere."
" Very good, very special!
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,10,"How much does it mean to have a cool story and a good director! Actually, it's the most important, for any film. And, this one has a generous script and a top notch professional director. I've always liked Luc Besson, starting with ""Le Dernier Combat (The Last Battle),"" which fascinated me when I first saw it a long time ago (seeing it recently, I did not like it anymore) . Moving through ""Subway"", ""The Big Blue"", ""La Femme Nikita"", ""Léon: The Professional"", ""The Fifth Element"", Besson has become better and better, more spectacular, more refined. Climbing with this ""Lucy"". The first movie in which I like Scarlett Johansson and Morgan Freeman (I'm not the fan of anyone). But here I liked them both, very much (secret: good story, good director) And all the other actors are good. Spectacular filming, stunts like I've never seen, fights as I've never seen before, all new and innovative. And, an editing like I've never seen before. A spectacular, dynamic film, from the first frame to the last, not one second of boredom. Very good, congratulations to everyone, I will always see it again with great pleasure. It's all worth the congratulations, because the result is visible, they worked hard on this film, and with a great achievement!"
" Lucy
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,6,"I browsed the reviews and concluded that my taste in cinematic entertainment is not the norm. Harsh negatively embellished comments really fall short of grasping the escape factor from real life/science. This is a film I watch a few times a year or when I just want the best exposure to watching a highly talented actress play the role.Plausibility of what we would be able to do using a greater portion of our brain power brings me to Carlos Castaneda teachings; Yogis; Aborigines; Indigenous Shamans; and the initiated to going beyond the very closed mindedness of Occidental (materialistic culture). Thus the condemnation of the film - is the predicted reflex if Occidental perception to psychologically attach to the predominate negative aspect of expression - civilized behavior.You connect with the universe (expand your self awareness/collective consciousness) you have to cut the wires (neural cortex limitations to enliven the Limbic System) to your Westernized-dualistic perceptions. I like that Morgan Freedman plays the scientific catalyst. Added credibility to the Darwin theory. We do exist in a prevailing Darwian economy if you haven't noticed.The drug smuggling thugs is emblematic of society's ignorance and selfish greed. Lucy becomes the monolithic inspiration for us to evolve in our awareness beyond dependency on technology. We ultimately are the technology.Technically, the script is tight, stands on all fours- smuggling of the drug in ""mules"" is very feasible(ask a DEA agent) and the fetus growing hormone does exist. I Googled it.Remember, we never thought of using computer laptops 50 years ago or an Internet. Nor using DNA evidence to prove criminal activity and trace our birthright heritage. As Einstein said, ""Information isn't knowledge."" Knowledge comes from pushing the limits of our minds by daily exercise in breaking through falsehoods-critical thinking - not negation of ""what if"". We know telepathy is fact. Bifurcation is possible.This film brings awareness to the fundamental prospect of groundbreaking cures being sought after by pharmaceutical induced target specific genome treatment research. There is still a lot we don't know or just block out - for instance your eyes don't see a rainbow - it creates it in your mind. That's how light and our Ozone bends sunlight. Perception of reality is ""time"" as stated by Lucy. And Einstein even came to this conclusion: that beyond time is eternal love. All encompassing is our ancestral past, present and future. That is the perception Lucy attains through mind expansion. We are all basically an energy field tuned to specific vibratory frequencies-according to Tesla. Einstein concurs.Lucy evolves into the collective universal entity that exists in all of us. Higher States of awareness-people with high IQs are exceptionally brilliant intellectuals-with photographic memories; mathematical whizzes, telepathic. Child prodigy's in chess.I love Lucy for all the reasons I mentioned and ones to be shown to me each time I watch the film; on my cinematic journey to enlightenment."
" AVOID unless you are taking serious drugs
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,2,"Hi I will remember the name Luc Besson so that I can avoid anything he's written.There is so much to say about this movie and none of it is good, so suffice to say, it is the dumbest movie and waste of time ever. I've watched commercials that were more gripping."
" Nonsensical garbage
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,3,"'Lucy' tells the story of an ordinary woman who develops superhuman, godlike abilities after she is abducted by a drug lord. Lucy is forced to hide illegal drugs inside her in order to transport them abroad, but when the substance accidentally leaks, she begins to develop superhuman powers and abilities.This might be science fiction, but that doesn't excuse such a ridiculous plot. It's so illogical and dumb that, while Lucy might be gaining brain capacity, it feels like you as the viewer are losing your own. Very little of this story makes sense, especially the second half of the film which is almost entirely action and violence.The most frustrating thing for me is how Morgan Freeman is wasted in a role that could have been filled by anyone. Ultimately his presence brings nothing to the film. 'Lucy' is garbage and will probably only satisfy the die-hard sci-fi fan."
" I wish I could unseen this insult to Sci-Fi genre

The movie is just stupid from the very first moment they say we humans use only 10% of our brain, a myth debunked many years ago, and this is stated right at the beginning (the whole movie is based on that premise) so we start the movie with the left foot.However, the first scene is quite promising with great suspense and terror: Scarlett is kidnapped and forced to work for these drug mobsters as a mule. Then a moment later, when you see her in convulsions crawling on walls and ceiling as she was a girl from an Asian horror movie you know there is something wrong there. All goes downhill from that scene on.I don't know why I kept watching, maybe just because I love that woman. Anyway she does not look that good here and her character is so empty and inhuman you just don't give a damn about her after a while. She kills lots of innocent people just because they don't speak her language, or because she needs a surgery, or because she is being late. And on the other hand she doesn't kill the mobsters who put her into this mess. WTF is that? Oh and while killing all those people she was supposed to get smarter! What kind of message is that? You get smarter, you kill people for no reason? Almost at the end Morgan Freeman's character says ""I am not sure if humanity is prepared for this."" Frigging A! Of course, we are not prepared, that woman is the proof! If you use more than 10% of your brain you will become a ruthless killing cyborg, not a human being! In fact, after she receives the ""knowledge"" she even starts speaking emotionless as the Terminatrix from T3. The movie has lots of plot holes with ridiculous scenes, gratuitous violence, etc. It's so over the top that it's boring. At some point I thought I was watching a Japanese Anime with live actors, a parody or something, but the movie actually is meant to be taken seriously! All of a sudden being intelligent makes you able to morph, time travel using swipe moves in the air like John Anderton did in Minority Report and see ""The Matrix"" everywhere as Neo once did?I am so sorry about this movie and I can't believe it was made by the same guy who made Leon and Nikita. My 2 points are only for the guys who did the CGI."
" Too much exaggeration
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,3,"The movie is cinematic-ally brilliant with nice looking graphics and great acting. But as far as story is concerned, its illogical, too much exaggerated and uselessly stretched. I've seen good movies with the same concept, for instance ""Limitless"", which has almost same idea but the way they presented it, didn't let us feel it is a science fiction, rather reality. Controlling body cells and metabolism is somehow a logical thing, but CONTROLLING TIME AND THE PLANET!? Its way too much exaggerated. Not recommended."
" Last 15 minutes are worth watching the rest of the movie
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,6,"I am happy I didn't follow my instinct to quit this after the horrible first hour. With all its second-class action movie plot in the background and not so good CG the major part of the movie did actually build quite a good momentum for the surprising end.Some very interesting philosophical points were given through the movie, some very discretely and some not. All of them led to quite good portray of life. I personally did find some references to the evolution and rise of AI. Especially the pace of the AI revolution may match to the one in this movie.If you're looking for an action movie, this is average. If you have a taste for details, be careful. In the end you will be surprised as I was!"
" very good
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,7,"I have read reviews and the point missed was that Morgan said there are two things to do and that is to 'reproduce' and or become' immortal' and when I realized this I understood that she dabbled with that kiss to the Frenchman and that this meant he thought of maybe using him for reproduction ,but chose Immortality by getting the other blue packets and sucking them into her system.Then she was omnipresent and this suggests GOD! Goodflick..got me thinking..."
" An Entire Movie Based on Ignorance!
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,1,"Humans do not use only 10% of their brains. If you suffer an injury to any part of your brain, you will suffer some debilitation. We use 100% of our brains and one of the dumbest science myths ever is the entire plot of this movie. That's just pathetic, and I can't sit through total garbage like that. If the writer had any knowledge of anything whatsoever, he/she could have created a plausible story, but instead we get a multi-million dollar production with the intelligence of a 5th grader. This embarrasses me as an American."
" More fiction than science but at least it wasn't a horror movie
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,7,"Most films that are promoted as science fiction usually turn out to be some other genre masquerading as sci-fi by adding space ships or futuristic settings. It seems like 90% of the time they turn to be horror movies with the werewolf replaced by an alien or the haunted house replaced by a space ship.To Lucy's credit, it actually tries to inject a bit of speculative science, but in the end it turns out to be mostly a superhero/revenge/action movie, with flashy special effects.To buy into this movie, you have to accept Professor Norman (Morgan Freeman)'s lecture early on which reiterates the old story about how humans only use 10% of their brains. His theory is that if we could unlock more, we'd develop ""powers"" like mind control, similar to how dolphins developed echolocation.His theory is proved true by Lucy (Scarlett Johansson) who is kidnapped and turned into an unwilling drug mule by Taiwanese gangsters. They surgically implant a bag of their new, experimental drug into her abdomen. Then one of the stupider henchmen kicks her in the stomach, breaking the bag open and giving her a massive overdose. The main side effect (besides apparently briefly reversing the direction of gravity) is that it starts to unlock more and more of her brain.As the percentage she can use is occasionally flashed on screen she starts developing superpowers like telekinesis, the ability to alter her appearance, the ability to see and control the flow of digital data, and eventually even time travel.The bad guys pursue Lucy as she attempts to get more of the drug to unlock more and more of her mind, both so she can get revenge and so she can transmit her new-found knowledge to mankind. Meanwhile her abilities get vaster and ever stranger as she turns into some sort of super-intelligent, emotionless robot-person.If you can buy into the sci-fi part of it, you still have to believe that most of the characters (including Lucy) can just shoot people willy-nilly with little or no repercussions. For example, there's a scene shortly after she escapes from her captors early in the film where she walks into a hospital toting a big gun, walks into an operating room, shoots the patient on the table, pushes him aside and demands that the doctor remove the remaining bag of drugs from her stomach. She even has time for a lengthy phone call with her mom. Then she just walks out of the hospital like nothing had happened. What, the hospital had no security? No one thought to call the police when a bloody, gun-toting woman came strolling in?But if you can buy all that, the movie is well put together and a visual treat. And I have to admit that I didn't turn it off (I watched it on TV) because I had to see where it was going and how it would end. The ending is actually pretty clever, although it starts to approach 2001 A Space Odyssey level obscurity for a while there."
" Lousy attempt
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,5,"The movie is based on the ancient concept of expansion of consciousness. A human mind is limited by ego barriers and our own personality stops us from seeing the bigger picture. If we could get over obstacles we set up to ourselves, and we started to expand our consciousness further and further, at some point we would merge with collective consciousness, namely, we would become one with God. Interesting idea, but in this movie, unfortunately, banalized and made into lousy SF. Luc Besson should continue to make Taxi sequels, cause it fits him much better than lousy attempts at spiritual SF.4,5/10"
" A Bizarre Flight of Fantasy, but WOW...
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,8,"I'm giving it an 8, just because I've watched it three times, and it still has my attention...This is a rather dry and subdued look at the potential power of the human mind, and I'm one of those ten percent that find it fascinating...Lucy takes her boyfriend's place as a narcotics ""mule"", ends up with a large bag of blue drug surgically inserted in her stomach cavity. The bag leaks, and she begins a transformation into a super mind, with bizarre mental powers materializing throughout the flick.Now, like I said before, this is a rather dry and bizarre movie, so it won't appeal to a huge audience. The ending is something of a let down for superhero fanatics, but I found it appropriate in maintaining the subdued atmosphere...I find that I really do like this one...**Update** Heh heh, I'm watching it for about the eighth time tonight 20 November, and it is still exciting to watch..."
" Potentially good but a disappointing failure
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,3,"Like far too many movies these days, an interesting plot sets the stage for a potentially good movie but it ends with a thud. Yeah, I get it, we only use a small portion of our brains and potentially have the power to do so much more. I suspect the writer/director used less of their brain than the average person uses when the ending of the movie was decided upon. What could have been thought-provoking ended up being a pointless waste of 90 minutes. Like so many other movies that end in what would be, in a book, mid-sentence, I'm left feeling like they simply ran out of film."
" ""I am everywhere""
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,9,"The most stunning thing about this movie (aside from Scarlett Johansson) is the deep spiritual meaning that comes near the end. Yes, amid all the mayhem, the shoot 'em ups, the science impossible there is something very redeeming about this and it has to do with what it means to be alive and to be human.What Lucy is able to do cannot possibly come about from taking substances into her system as in the movie. However the incredible power, knowledge and freedom she achieves is something that may be possible for humans some distant day--or rather possible for our intelligently designed descendants who will be cyborgs or something beyond that.The story itself and the way French born director Luc Besson (""Léon: The Professional,"" ""La Femme Nikita,"" etc.) moves the plot along with action that keeps us enthralled amounts to a first rate sci fi thriller. Johansson who plays Lucy and whose countenance dominates the film is wonderful. And I don't mean merely from the fact that her face is mesmerizing but also because she does such a great acting job in a demanding role.I am giving this film only 9 stars because of the rather lame idea that we use only ten percent of our brains. That idea was disposed of decades ago. Of course as a metaphor it works okay. However it could be better said that we are currently achieving only ten percent of what we could achieve.I also don't think Besson, who also wrote the script for the film, has the right notion about time. He has Lucy say, ""Time is the only true unit of measure. It gives proof to the existence of matter. Without time, we don't exist."" However, time like other units of measure really just compares two or more things, in this case events. Many scientists believe that time per se does not exist and is an abstraction, or as I see it time is a mathematical point.But much of the philosophy and/or psychology in the film is if nothing else interesting and worth thinking about. For example Lucy says, ""We've codified our existence to bring it down to human size, to make it comprehensible, we've created a scale so we can forget its unfathomable scale."" This is true in a practical sense but I believe it is also true in a philosophical and a spiritual sense.I will be seeing this film again.--Dennis Littrell, author of ""The World Is Not as We Think It Is"""
" Great fun really, a bombshell, sci-fi galore, and something that stays with you
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed watching this, i believe the movie looks if not too deeply at a choice we have to make over and over, should i follow what i believe is right and question this again and again as to expand my consciousness or 'tried and true, safe way that breeds frustration as i cannot possibly be happy by repressing the uniqueness of who i am by submitting to everything and everyone but believe this is safe'. Really interesting and surprising at many instances, of course Luc Besson has contributed to many a blockbuster including the 5th element, Le professional, among others, i enjoyed the quality of the effects, the well supported story line and of course felt entertained once i viewed the whole movie, the riveting ending and the ongoing confrontation with the Korean gang, past the ending i did feel i learned something and that t me is always a measure of entertainment."
" Johansson is undoubtedly a Hollywood leading lady
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,7,"Ambitious in its subject matter - Writer/Director Luc Beeson continues to stay true to his storytelling regardless of how ridiculous its content. I enjoyed the idea of the film but felt it didn't execute to its potential. This is definitely a ""love it or absolutely hate it"" kind of film in its genre. I feel like I approached the film appropriately anticipating exactly what it intended to be - just a fun 90 minute thrill ride with an absurd premise - w/ Scarlett Johansson & Morgan Freeman at the helm. AND by the way - after seeing Ghost In The Shell & now Lucy - there's no reason for any haters out there to doubt Scarlett's talent & ability AND bank-ability as a Hollywood leading lady. You can always count on Beeson to be authentic and unafraid to put everything into his filmmaking; so go into Lucy open-minded and you may actually find yourself liking it."
" Didn't make any sense
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,3,"Now I'm not saying anything really bad about this movie, but what was the point of this? Scarlett Johansson able to access through computers and then suddenly at the end she is in control of everything on the internet? Come on man. I mean I know this is an action sci-fi film but did this really have to be made? I mean who would want to make an action sci-fi film about Scarlett Johansson who plays Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe a freaking computer system? Scarlett shouldn't even be in these crappy sci-fi action films and just stick with being just Black Widow in the Marvel movies. Of course she was fantastic as Kaa in the CGI live-action version of the Jungle Book too. Seriously the director of this film needs to rethink this so that way he can sleep better at night."
" Not Bad.
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,6,"-I know that the main point in this movie is not a story about Lucy and Richard but film starts corrupted a bit.-Creating invisible things and make people can't move? Exaggerated.-Sliding your hands and traveling to the Big Bang? Exaggerated.There are such silly things like these in this movie but except them, you must watch it.My Note: 7/10"
" Incoherent
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,3,"This isn't a film which bears close scrutiny. It appears to have been developed from the mashing together of a few factoids, without any deeper understanding or research.i, The three million year old skeleton of Australopithecus afarensis named ""Lucy"" evidences the progression of skull size and brainpower in our species' development.ii, Lucy was named for a song which many believe is about drugs.iii, The odd idea that seems to have taken hold that we only use 10% of our brain.Add in a superhero element, some strands of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Christian deity themes of omniscience, omnipresence, and Michaelangelo's Creation of Adam, obligatory violence and a car chase.As a thesis, it fails utterly. As a distraction, it was enough to keep me watching to the end; a ridiculous end, at that, where Lucy turns herself into graphite powder and a suspiciously long USB stick (as if that's what humans are fashioned from).There's the usual Hollywood fare of casting an English-accented male as a baddie, zero concern for incidentals who die as a result of the plot, a deep confusion between intelligence and memory, and a professor whose gibberish is eaten up by other academics because he talks slowly and appears to be amusing himself in his own mind with hyper intelligent asides (even though he actually seems to be thinking about some cat videos he saw on YouTube).There's enough in the film for reviewers to hang a theory on but it's all so incoherent. People will always try to connect dots that really aren't connected; it's human nature. If I made a film about Fred Flintstone, a tortoise, some spam, and Donald Trump's elbow, someone would make a connection. Admit it - you want to.All that said, the car chase was rather spiffy, and I liked the font used to display what percentage of her brain Lucy was using. The rest was risible. It's what I expect from Hollywood, but not really what I've come to expect from Luc Besson."
" Open your minds
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,8,"I didn't see this when it was out at the cinema because the posters made it look like a ""medusa touch"" horror, and I don't like being scared. I've just watched it on terrestrial TV, though, and I was sucked in by it after a few minutes.It starts off quite camp, but the ideas behind it I thought were more grown up, and they don't deserve the dissing that is meted out in reviews.Spoiler: | | | | \/ The idea that reality is very complex seems to be backed up by quantum entanglement experiments, dark energy conjectures, and variable speed of light hypothesis. We've even got to the point where physicists are claiming many universes might exist, continuously dividing, or that we are all living inside a computer simulation. The idea that the human brain is too primitive to process this complex reality also seems fair. The idea that the human brain constructs a simple model of the world in order to enable it to function in a complex universe therefore seems highly plausible. Some people have even gone as far as saying that time is an illusory construct to stop everything from happening at once. ISTR in the film, Lucy says that time is what gives legitimacy to matter. If a higher brained being did see things as they truly are, rather than in a mirror darkly, is it unreasonable to think that he might be able to smash the illusion, or to take control? I therefore don't think the antigravity, telekinesis, precognition etc is so silly."
" An 'amazing story' for today
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,8,"Confession time first – I was initially drawn to this movie because it stars Scarlett Johansson, a favourite screen actor of mine who by this time had become enough of a 'star' to help a movie into the listings even (perhaps especially) though the script may be a little outside the usual Hollywood fayre. This movie may be a case in point, the story of a girl who accidentally ingests a dose of drugs which cause her to bring into use the full power of her brain beyond the 'ten percent' of it which we normally call on.It's worth remembering that this movie is a work of fiction, based very loosely if at all on any real science, rather than a documentary, something which director Luc Besson has himself pointed out in at least one interview. But while it's not something you'd quote in a science paper, this movie is a great piece of entertainment whose pace and increasing scale make for a great adventure. Scarlett Johansson is found again in the kind of role which she plays so well, that of the bemused 'outsider' who doesn't initially understand what's going on around – or in this case, inside - her. Her journey from this state to one of awareness and growing command of her increasing power gives the film a very strong narrative drive.During one sequence, the title of one of the old pulp sci-fi magazines, 'Amazing Stories', came to mind. 'Lucy' is truly an 'amazing story' for our day, based very loosely (if at all) on actual science, but if taken in that spirit – as a 'scientific thriller', perhaps - it makes for great entertainment, and is well worth seeing."
" Hard to swallow, even for the spiritually open-minded
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,5,"People say we use only 10% of our brains. The scientific community is 100% sure this is false. Call me a killjoy, but I find it hard to accept movies that are based on an utterly anti-scientific premise. In fact, I find promoting blatant falsehoods that promote anti-evolutionary thinking a bit irresponsible, even for the sake of art and entertainment!Science education set aside, how does LUCY work as a movie? Well, Scarlett Johansson is convincingly awkward and beautiful. Luc Besson's obsession with strong mysterious female leads clearly shines through and Johansson as an actor delivers. The movie is hyper-stylish, with gleaming colors and convincing CGI (lots of). The action is as entertaining as the visuals. And thankfully they decided to keep things short, focus on the core idea and stop right before it became trite.That said, I think LIMITLESS dealt with the 10% myth better as it stayed (somewhat) more within the realm of scientific credibility. And as far as movies go in which people develop godlike powers, LUCY doesn't beat the likes of THE MATRIX or SYMBOL (shimboru,2009).All in all an interesting but ultimately mediocre movie based on an utterly ridiculous (and intellectually dangerous) idea."
" A Touch Too Much
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,5,"Coerced by someone she thought was her friend, ""Lucy"" (Scarlet Johansson) is taken prisoner by a Korean drug lord named ""Mr. Jang"" (Min-sik Choi) and forced to become a drug mule for him. To that end, a packet of a new drug called CPH4 is surgically inserted into her abdomen and she is told that she must take it from Taipei it to a city in Europe. However, prior to leaving she is treated rather harshly by one of her captors which results in the bag breaking open and releasing a large quantity of the new drug into her system. This causes her to have increased mental powers which continue to rise to an alarming degree. And using the new powers that she comes upon she also gains revenge on those who put her in this predicament. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this started off rather well but began to get out-of-control towards the end. It was all a touch too much. Perhaps if the director (Luc Besson) had kept things moving at a slower pace then it's possible this film could have really been something special. Unfortunately, he kept upping the ante to the point that it bordered on the ridiculous. Again, while this wasn't a bad film necessarily it could have been much better and I have rated it accordingly. Average."
" Asking the Wrong Question
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,6,"SPOILER ALERT!(July 2014.) I saw the much-anticipated 'Lucy' last weekend and, before going into my review, I'd like to make a few preliminary comments. First, I am a huge fan of Luc Besson. Ever since 'La Femme Nikita,' I was convinced this guy could do no wrong. Second, I am in love with Scarlett Johansson—don't tell my wife. Third, I'm very aware that no matter what I say here, this movie will make a ton of money. So that said, what's my take? I was disappointed.Apparently, 'Lucy' couldn't decide what it wanted to be. On the one hand, it is a smart, funny, bloody sci-fi thriller that doesn't skimp on the action. On the other, it's an vfx- laden treatise on the history of man and his ability to utilize the untapped potential of his brain. Judging by the official trailer, I was promised the former. And I was getting it in all its Luc Besson glory until Lucy finally meets Morgan Freeman's Professor Norman in Paris. There was an upside to the mindy, spacey stuff that takes us from man's beginnings with the original Lucy to the wonders of the universe. I enjoyed the visual effects— especially when Lucy stops Time with a wave of her hand. Sure, that's cool. And the movie came in at ninety minutes, which meant we weren't saddled with a slow-moving second act. But when the screenwriter stops caring that Lucy is on the lam and an evil Korean guy is after her, and opts instead to focus on her morphing into a frickin' computer made of giant Nutella-like tendrils, that's when you lose me. This is a basic tenet of screen writing. As we've learned over the years, it's the Hero's Journey, people. So what happened to Lucy? Well, SHE DIDN'T COME BACK! Instead of an arc, we got a trajectory. She never gets to have the final battle with Mr. Jang—that's left to the battle-weary French cop Pierre Del Rio. Once Lucy's brain reaches a hundred percent utilization, she trips off somewhere beyond Time and Space, probably meeting up with an alternate universe version of herself, which is the OS from 'Her.' Seriously? What am I supposed to do with pure energy? I invested a lot of my emotions in this woman, and now she just disappears? And just like Professor Norman, I am left with nothing but a thumb drive with a bunch of ones and zeroes on it. Great. I guess I should start that backup now. Oh wait, she melted all the computers.The movie already has the elements of a great sci-fi action thriller—bad guys, experimental drugs, exotic locations and a woman who, though she graduated Phi Beta Kappa, starts out dumb as spit when it comes to choosing men. Speaking of bad guys, the only thing better than a Korean bad guy is pairing him with an English bad guy. Bravo, Luc!As I said before, I was good with everything until the fateful meeting with Professor Norman. Previously, she had only spoken to him by phone or video screen. But once she meets with the good professor and other scientists, we're transported to the Science Channel as Lucy's brain utilization increases and everyone discusses the nature of Time and Space. At this point, I wouldn't have been surprised if everyone adjourned to a nice restaurant and spent the next five hours discussing Sartre or the symbolism behind clowns in horror movies. Here's my idea for a third act. When Mr. Jang and his army arrive at the university to kill Lucy, she is already starting to lose her powers because the drug is wearing off. That, coupled with a blinding headache and other side effects from the drug, it's a question of whether she can still take out the bad guys before they can kill her. A massive final battle ensues where everything—the university, everything—is destroyed as Lucy battles with Mr. Jang and his men while becoming weaker and weaker. At a critical moment, Mr. Jang shoots Lucy. Weak and bloody she still manages to send him to hell. Then she collapses as the professor makes his way to her. As the professor examines her, he realizes that she is once again human. How? Well, her irises appear normal. Working fast, he and Del Rio get her to the hospital, where surgeons operate on her and she recovers. Epilogue. Lucy is standing outside the airport with Del Rio. She's going home to see her parents. He says, ""I guess we'll never know what would have happened had you hit a hundred percent."" Just then, a toddler drifts into the path of an oncoming taxi, his mother running after him and screaming in French. Suddenly, the taxi stops completely, as if Time itself had stopped. The crying mother retrieves her child as Del Rio stares at Lucy in amazement. ""What?"" she says, smiling. Then she kisses the cop on the cheek and walks into the terminal. Setup for a sequel? You bet. Every great movie asks a question at the beginning that must be answered at the end. In 'Lucy,' the question appears to be ""what would happen if we could access our whole brain instead of just ten percent?"" To me, that's the wrong question. It has nothing to do with a hero's life. What happened to Lucy could have happened to anyone—the conniving boyfriend, the French cop or Professor Norman. I think a better question is, ""Will Lucy become the person she is meant to be?"""
" Mindless is only proper word for this cerebral capacity nonsense romp
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,2,"Doing movie about cerebral capacity usage without any logic, with heavy pseudo science - that's what Luc Besson (writer and director) did here. I can think only that he was high during whole time when made it. Too bad, because he really has gift for film making. Only good thing about this was pace, that's why I gave 2 stars. Actors: Morgan Freeman in another typical role of ""scientist"", throwing another pile of crap to audiences - like that cell will choose immortality in environment without life support :-). Indeed, movie would be much better without that whole pseudo science crap - but it tried to be serious - what is biggest flaw. Scarlett Johansson: probably best cast for this. Cool bitch most of time. Possible that some did not accept role after reading script. Overdone violence, without any sense in most cases: probably worst moment was killing of taxi driver just because he did not speak English. But that driving during Paris, causing death of minimum 20 people was also plain mindless. Couple words about superpowers: how can increasing cerebral capacity bring telekinetic, time travel and other things ? Author seriously lacks some elementary knowledge. But he likes blood on screen. No thanx, no Luc. We don't need such person, who kills brainlessly, lacks any empathy totally to be someone who shows us the new path. You are just lost, and sequel (what I just saw that is announced) can be only even bigger pile of nonsense."
" 100 % Brain activity would equal total burnout
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,8,"I liked the film. stylish and nicely tempo-ed, good entertainment. Now concerning the fantasy of obtaining 100% brain activity. I don't think that is possible. first of all, the brain is not purely intellectual. a large part of the brain is controlling hormones and chemical stuff in the body. Lucy says she can control all of that, by changing her hair color and growing the hair long in an instant. How can you cognitively ""know"" when to force the body to produce a hormone ? and Dolphins have a sonar, however they have a large organ to project the waves, humans haven't, at least not that developed ( needs to be investigated !) However to use 100% of your brain, would be a complete burnout of the brain. In the interviews after the film there's a neural scientist that says there are many drugs that are intellectually or cognitive, like Ritalin. however I have seen people on Ritalin. And after a blissful high, they go rock bottom and needs several days of rest, to get back in balance . the drug in the film was a natural pregnancy drug, that seemingly females produce once pregnant. Just like the body can produce endorphin when were in love. I would say that if humans is to use 20 % of their brain, the brain first of all must be double in size, then still use 10% of that double size, that would be 20% of our brain mass. the problem is not the 10% of the brain. but realizing a good idea and pull it off, not being ""afraid"" and impose too many barriers on the natural behavior. I think the movie was good entertainment."
" It has a cool plot with cool story..But needed more..
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,5,Lucy has cool story to build. It has potential but it failed largely.Lets Talk About the good things. The action is good. There is a scene in the plane for 3 minute with Lucy's body skin coming off that was cool. And another scene with Lucy Driving that was fantastic. Now with the negative things. This movie Starts Suddenly and in the start there is a scene with a mouse going towards a mouse trap for 3 seconds only to give us a hint that Lucy is going into a trap. And through Out the next 1 hour they are showing us this type stuff. Lucy got the ability from the drugs which is put inside her belly to transport. while he is in the captive of the drug transporters despite knowing that she has drugs in her belly they kicked her there didn't care about the drugs or transportation and Lucy got powers.These Powers started as believable but as the movie goes by became totally unbelievable and over the top.The dialogues are cheap some times. Even when the character of Morgan Freeman comes to know that she has the ability to unlock the brain potential 100% with drugs his reaction was just sympathy to her that's bad script writing and that's through all over the movie.She did things which was believable if it is shown to us properly but instead of that things just happens and Lucy is in her 100% and She travels through time.At the end she described things which seems and feels totally over the top.In the Lucy Is nor horrible neither good. Its A flat movie with great concept but feels over the top concept because of bad directing and script....5/10.....

I usually read others', but this time I did really feel I had to tell mine.So, like many other movies, the idea, the concept is fine, even great, considering I'm a science fanatic, despite all the bullshit about using the x% of our brain and such. Few points that sum my opinion.1. Random wilderness footage at the beginning is really random and weird, especially considering they have no direct linking to the happenings and, after two-three scenes, the idea is totally discarded.2. Something that should start from epic karate skills suddenly turn out to let Lucy levitate, like if she's somehow possessed by a demon. What's the point?3. What's the real point of the whole movie, besides explaining what happens when brain reaches 100%?4. Why should she keep all the drugs for herself? So that they won't fall in the wrong hands? What could be ""wrong"" hands if she, herself, kills directly and indirectly hundreds of people to accomplish this?5. Luc is a really bad director, we all know that, but even kindergarten children would be disappointed to find out when she's at 20, 30, 50% blatantly flashing in your face instead of slowly discovering themselves how escalading is the brain of Lucy. Very, very, very wrong move, mr. Besson...6. When Lucy start disintegrating herself, no explanation is given: what and why is that happening? She basically can manipulate the matter but she still can't keep herself altogether.7. The final scene clearly explains she created a pendrive containing all the human knowledge she, as a 'goddess', could gather throughout her space-time traveling skills. Why rushing like this, if she clearly states 'she's anywhere' and therefore can do this later or in any other, simpler, fancier way possible?Definitely a great idea condensed in a poor, sad, low-cost, b-movie film. It was just like giving all the knowlegde to cure cancer to a fish entrapped in a glass bowl. Hope to see a remake by someone else, like Mr. Nolan."
" I get it...wait what.....no I don't
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,5,"I went into this movie with my eyes and mind open but along the way it lost me. I get it she ingested this massive amount of drugs (possible spoiler) and it starts to change her but it has a car crash way of doing it. I understood the matrix no problem but this had me scratching my head and my best friend was looking at me like ""wtf did we just watch?"" I do like S.J in most of her roles and she carries this off well.I just found it too flashy but she is just enough to carry the movie with a bit of action thrown in.Props if you understood it but it just was not my cup of tea."
" Besson's newest film can't convince the audience in any category possible
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,5,"Just saw the movie in a sneak peak preview. Actually I was excited as I saw that it was ""Lucy"". The first half an hour was genius. The analogical cuts to short animal clips fitted perfectly. Also Lucy's role is been shown strongly and believable. But Besson couldn't take up the picture heavy-, Stanley Kubrick- style of filming for too long and returned to his bog-standard pattern of popcorn-cinema-action, which indeed had new Superlucy-aspects but could not fulfill the full potential of this movie. The next problem is the not existing narrative structure and logical flaws here and there. Besson's compulsive, mandatory chase in the streets of Paris with French cars and Lucy's not-so-understandable revenge campaign are also part of the story. Apart of that Besson tried to implement a bit pseudoscience, but also could not integrate that consistently which results in rudimentary sentences like Bill and Ted's ""all we are is dust in the wind dude"".Conclusion: A genre mix without a soundtrack that stays in mind, a Johansson, who wants to play a strong and believable role, but can't because of the staging which doesn't reach the audience to a 100 percent. A strong and image-heavy implementation which collapses too fast to a below standard look and causes every role to fade away. A pinch of ""I need energy and matter"" á la ""Transcendence"" and complete is Besson's newest film, which can't convince the audience in any category possible."
" Super Woman goes out of control-A ""Space Oddessy"" Ending
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,8,"Lucy is also the nickname of one of the earliest known primitive ape-like creatures that evolved into modern man. This Lucy (Scarlett Johanssen) is an American ex-patriate living in Taiwan. She is captured and turned into a drug-carrying ""mule"" with a package of a most powerful drug that she accidentally absorbs into her body. Things go terribly wrong. She slowly evolves into a super-being that makes Supergirl look like a panty-waist. She is able to control all manner of communication, and hooks up with a most learned professor played, of course by Morgan Freeman, in Paris. The Taiwanese ""Mafia"" wants their drugs back which leads to an action film with a very intense appetite for bloody carnage as people are stabbed and shot to death all over the place. Even she kills people. It saves time! She appears to regress back to the beginning of time as her brain usage approaches 100%. Us puny humans only use 10% of our brainpower while dolphins use up to 20%. So she has everything from x-ray vision to the ability to defy gravity and sticks her assassins, helpless, on the ceiling. She also has better diagnostic powers than a CAT or PET scan. She learns Chinese in an hour. She places all her total accumulation of knowledge into a pen-drive and disappears entirely. Some of the digital effects make no sense whatsoever as she ""reaches out"" to the mainframe computer in the University Office. She Tweets back ""I Am Everywhere"". A great mind-bending (far-out) light show that takes us back to the very beginning of time that is almost comprehensible, given the storyline. Stanley Kubrick and Douglas Trumbull would be proud. Totally entertaining if you can stand its brutally violent nature, but also totally preposterous and unbelievable."
" Luc Besson was hijacked by an idiot
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,1,"10 % myth. Bringing the suitcase to the client instead of getting a locksmith or something to brake the chain (she already had extra 500 dollars) and then bring the suitcase to the cops. drug makes her all mighty, others who know how to make that drug pursue her instead of using the drug for themselves by making more. A professor claims that cells can be immortal and speaks about the 10% myth and is still a professor. I forgive this one but the guy must be really idiotic to say that the first human was named Lucy as in, her name when she was alive was Lucy and related stupidity. Lucy lets the mobsters life, but kills the person in the hospital bed, kills the taxi driver, kills random people on cars during the car chase. She recommends organic food. The cops are pursuing her but suddenly turn on her side (ok, maybe it is because they found the mobsters first, but they were very unsuccessful getting ready for the mobsters). We could make a drink-every-time-something-is-idiotic-in-this-movie game, but it would be lethal to the players."
" So Cliché...
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,1,"As I watched this I thought to myself that there can hardly be anything more pseudo-intellectual than this movie. Scenes are predictable; there is no convincing explanation for the main character turn out to be the way she is at the end - except for the fact that she is Scarlett Johansson - and the fact that Morgan Freeman was thrown in there looks a lot like a desperate decision in the hope that the whole plot would appear any smarter.From an action-movie perspective, nothing interesting goes on either, as the main character seems to be nearly always on top of situations, offering no thrill to the viewer.In fact this is an extremely visual movie showing and attractive star who pretends to be doing intelligent stuff, whereas neither the characters not the plot get to be intellectually satisfactory.In my view, the 40million spent on this movie could and would be better spent on a university funds. And that's about the only thing I can think right now as an alternative for the producers to possibly redeem themselves."
" Possible reality well presented with few entertainment gimmicks!
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,10,"I really enjoyed the movie scene by scene. The director skill-fully delivered the real purpose of life, self-realization!. This is what many religions are trying to convey for so long and terrible failing. Please don't mistake this for a sci-fi movie but it is 100% possible reality for everyone. There are ways to achieve it one has to explore but sure not by consuming CPH4 or any form of drugs.I strongly recommend this movie to anyone in the path of self-realization and people tired of society's terms and conditions. I give 10/10 for all the hard work and crystal clear story-line and screenplay. Hats off to the team and the cast.!"
" To knowledge.
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,7,"I recommend this one, not because it's *good*, but just because it is so completely bonkers, I couldn't help but enjoy it. This movie is not ""everything but the kitchen sink"", this movie is everything *and* the kitchen sink, with some dinosaurs and shootouts thrown in there too. Johansen plays a tourist caught in a drug smuggling operation, forced to be the drug mule, and carry the experimental new drug out of the country, hidden in her abdomen. When the packet of blue crystals and goo burst inside her, the fun begins. From then on, her character's IQ skyrockets, she reads people's minds, and the film becomes a series of explosions, shootouts, and wild chase scenes, as Morgan Freeman basically narrates (in this most ridiculous musical montages(!)) what, theoretically, happens if a human could access 100% of their brain, and while Scarlett Johansson's character basically becomes The Terminator.Bright and colourful, with good effects work, and a hilarious car chase, filled with stunts and car flips, and sexy Johansen in the lead make this fun and watchable, but its lead girl is unsympathetic and robotic, its logic is absurd, and its villains weak.One of this movies that can be fun if watched in the right frame of mind, but also one of the oddest films ever made."
" lead actress way too good for the movie
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,3,"Considering who is directing the movie, I had very high expectations. Alas.Visually very nice, plot has great potential, and Scarlett Johansson can play anything, but much of this good stuff is totally wasted. I have no problem with the premise - that humans don't use full potential of their brains, and it would certainly be intriguing to try and construct what would happen if that changed. But why so linear? Why so predictable? There's no intrigue, no conflict, no development. And why equate higher intelligence with emotional impotence? It is a contradiction in itself. Besides, if Lucy was totally emotionless, why would she try so hard to pass her knowledge, which is the sole reason for everything that happens in the movie?Finally, resorting to dinosaurs for me is a sign that creativity has reached rock bottom. Great disappointment."
" Very shabby
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,3,"This is very poor and quite bizarre. Propped up by the talents of Scarlet Johansson and Morgan Freeman, there is little going for this movie barring their acting talents.The concept piques one's curiosity to start with - an innocent girl caught in a dark deal starts to gain powers after massively overdosing on a new drug. But the idea is developed in the worst possible way - as a pointless expansion of her powers to superhuman with no real moral quandaries to worry about, backed up by the most ludicrous pseudoscience.I pity Freeman, tasked with playing the intellectual behind the absurd concept that by unlocking the untapped potential of the human brain, incredible powers over other people and inanimate objects can be unlocked.This concept gradually replaces any semblance of a plot line until I found myself counting down the minutes to the movie's end. Very shabby."
" Boring action shlock
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,4,"A bunch of needless trashy action that is completely incompatible with the plot. Lucy is, early into the movie, an omnipotent being who knows everything yet she refuses to end the trouble that's out to kill her. She effortlessly kills several goons who kidnapped and forced her into being a drug mule, but she doesn't kill the mastermind who controls the entire organization and can command armies of henchmen. Why? To fabricate a pointless conflict so we can have DUH SWEET ACTION SCENES, since there would be none otherwise as Lucy is god and can kill anyone at will. The ending is even worse, as she is even more powerful but *conveniently* occupies herself while the army of Chinese mafia raid the building. She sacrifices the lives of several security personnel, almost loses that airport guy who really serves no purpose in the story, and almost gets shot in the face herself because she thought it would be a good idea to not do anything about it."
