" Not the worst Will Farrell movie
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,4,"This movie has some cute smiley bits, little funny bits and awful many silly bits like a Will Farell movie is expected to be - not his worst movie though."
" HILARIOUS FEELGOOD FAMILY FUN
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,7,"What a great team up of Wahlberg & Ferrell as these two play off each other so well & reminded me of the old skool Classic comedies of the 80's like The Great Outdoors for an example where you get two great actors teamed up in a silly fun-filled Comedy of crazy antics & oh my things get ridiculously crazy & silly but always hilarious.
Mark Wahlberg & Will Ferrell were absolutely fantastic together in Buddy Action Cop Comedy,THE OTHER GUYS & carry on that perfect chemistry to this family Comedy with a big heart.
Basically Ferrell is a step dad to a couple of kids & is a very timid & loving type of guy & the kids real dad comes back into the picture & that's Mark Wahlberg who is the super cool, Handsome & muscular alpha male who wants to get back in with his beautiful wife & kids & push Ferrell out & it leads to many hilarious moments & side splitting humour.This is really a very feelgood film one that really cheered me up & cracked me up & I'm a fan of both actors as Will Ferrell is a comic genius & Mark Wahlberg is one of the greatest actors working today!!!
A really funny film with two great leads having a blast together & you can feel the fun."
" Not bad at all
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,6,"Daddy's home is a pretty good film and has a lot of silliness to it and laughs. The plot is rather run of the mill but handles it in a unique way, the entrance of the Dad played by Mark Wahlberg is genius and the relationship between him and Will Ferrell is really amusing in how Ferrell's character tries to win over his new
kids in increasingly ridiculous ways.6/10: Funny film for children and grown ups alike"
" Simply funny
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,7,Was a good movie if you want a laugh... all actors had brilliant comedy timing and the story was funny... the ending was funny too.
" Was very good but the ending didn't work for me.
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,6,"It felt like a producer or someone had insisted
on a ""safe"" ending, its as if the film could almost feel itself suddenly start failing and got embarrassed."
" Brilliant
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,1,This is the best comedy movie ever made and a great storyline also.
" If you like Will Ferrell films, you'll like Daddy's Home
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,7,"This film is a solid addition to Will Ferrell's filmography. If you are familiar with his films and enjoy that sort of humour, then Daddy's home will be right up your street.I was maybe expecting a little more, and thought that it could have been a tad funnier in parts, but I could be being overly critical. It was still funny, and there were a few really laugh out loud moments.Will Ferrell is always great, so there is no surprise that he smashed it in this role. He's building quite a decent onscreen partnership with Mark Wahlberg after a few outings together now, and their chemistry on screen was solid in this film.The story was fun, very predictable but still fun!There's not much more to say here really. I was entertained for an hour and a half, and if you like Will Ferrell films there's no reason you won't be entertained too."
" Very entertaining
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,9,"""Daddy's Home' is a lot of fun to watch. The are a ton of laughs in this movie. It has a very likeable cast. They all do a great job. They are all given time to shine. I actually saw ""Daddy's Home 2"" before I watched this one. It didn't make any difference. ""Daddy's Home"" is a lot of fun. It will be joining my regular rotation. Honorable mentions: Thomas Haden Church and Hannibal Buress."
" Dad off
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,6,It's funny in wierd ways and Will ferrell with Mark wahlberg worked well together in the movie.It was better than I expected it would be
" Average plot but great comedy
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,8,Nothing spectacular is going on in the plot but the movie is super funny. You are watching a comedy so who cares about the plot? I don't agree with all the negativity surrounding a very funny film that serves its purpose very well.
" Good Silly Fun
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,8,"This is good, classic comedy at its best. Will Ferrell vs. Mark Wahlberg for the attention of Will's wife (Mark is the baby daddy). It's absurd at times, but absurdly well done. I laughed out loud A LOT, and that's the point of comedy."
" A perfect weekend watch
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,10,"The movie is the perfect comedy to binge on the weekend, with some especially funny bits from Thomas Haden Church!"
" Hated it, Hated it, Hated it.
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,1,"1 star isn't enough for me to accurately describe how this movie made me feel.I'll attempt to explain. On a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 is a film that I absolutely loved, and 1 is a film that I didn't like anything about...Daddy's Home would be a -10/10.Because I actually HATED this movie. And I usually don't hate movies; I either like them, love them, or don't like them."
" Fun movie u can watch with whole fam
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,10,Surprise kids can watch too they find it funny to not only for adults enjoy friendly fam
" Standard Hollywood gruel, inoffensive but forgettable
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,5,This certainly wasn't as bad as I feared it would be and it was actually quite funny at times. Will Ferrell has plenty of good moments and the primary dynamic between him and Mark Wahlberg plays out quite amusingly. Is it memorable? No. Is it original? No. But will it while away a few hours after a long day at work? I suppose so. Half-hearted and predictable but some decent comedic acting pulls it through.
" Daddy's Home
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,3,"To be honest, I mainly knew about this film because of the Christmassy sequel starring Mel Gibson, it was rated low by critics, but I wanted to make my own mind up, directed by Sean Anders (Sex Drive, That's My Boy, Horrible Bosses 2). Basically, mild-mannered radio executive Brad Whitaker (Will Ferrell) struggles to be a good stepfather to Megan (Scarlett Estevez) and Dylan (Owen Wilder Vaccaro), the children of his wife Sara (Linda Cardellini). He is also seemingly sterile, following an accident some years ago. Over time, the children grow closer to Brad, with Dylan confiding in him about being bullied and Megan asking him to take her to a father/daughter school dance. One night, Sara receives a call from Dusty Mayron, her ex-husband and the kids' biological father. During the call Dusty discovers her new marriage to Brad and says he will be visiting the next day. Sara hesitates to let her ex-husband come, but Brad convinces her that it is important for the kids to have their father and stepfather establish a respectful relationship. When Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) arrives, Brad is immediately intimidated by his tough, muscular appearance and his charm with Megan and Dylan. Dusty repeatedly talks Brad into letting him stay, despite Sara warning about Dusty's true nature. It eventually becomes clear to Brad that Dusty is intending to drive him away from the kids and reconcile with Sara. Dusty shows Brad up constantly, including getting the kids a dog, finishing a treehouse, and making him appear to be racist. Dusty continues by trying to create tension between Brad and Sara, taking them to a fertility doctor, hoping Brad's inability to give Sara a baby will cause them to split so she will return to him. The two men do appear to reach an understanding, helping the children. Additionally, Brad and Sara are overjoyed to learn that they have a chance of having a child together after all. However, Brad is stunned when Dusty reveals that he still intends to drive him out of the family. Desperate to impress Sara and the kids, Brad spends thousands of dollars on early Christmas gifts, including a pony and the tickets to the best seats at a basketball game. At the game, Dusty once again shows Brad up, being friends with the coach of Dylan's favourite team. Irritated, Brad begins drinking heavily. During half-time, a drunken Brad is chosen to try to shoot a basketball to win a prize. Brad ends up ranting about Dusty before accidentally pelting a cheerleader and a disabled child in a wheelchair in the face with basketballs. Humiliated, Brad moves out of the house. But Dusty is rejected by Sara when he tries to comfort her and forces him to step up as a dad to help his kids. Four days later, Brad is depressed and living in his office at work. Dusty, meanwhile, is overwhelmed by the responsibilities of being a full-time father. When Dusty decides to call it quits and leaves on the day of Megan's father-daughter dance, his friend Griff (Hannibal Buress) goes to Brad and convinces him to fight for his family. Brad catches Dusty at a bar and tries to get him to come back. Dusty admits that being a father is hard and admires Brad for putting up with everything that he must go through. Brad says that being a dad with all the hardships is worth it because he is doing it for his children. Dusty is convinced to go to the dance, and he and Brad arrive together. There, they find out Dylan is being picked on by a girl named Serendipity (Reba Elizabeth Carston), and almost get into a fight with her father Jerry (Bill Burr). But Dusty acts like a father, he puts a stop to the fight by starting a dance-off. Brad and Sara reconcile, and Dusty decides to stay and be a good ""co-dad"" to his kids. Later, the whole family is happy; Brad and Sara have a new baby boy named after Griff, and Megan and Dylan have finally accepted Brad as their stepfather. Dusty has become wealthy a voiceover artist on Brad's radio station, and has moved across the road, and he and Brad are now friends. Dusty has also moved on after meeting a woman named Karen (Alessandra Ambrosio), and is now a stepfather himself, to Karen's daughter Adrianna (Didi Costine). Sara is immediately intimidated by Karen, being more gorgeous, and she is also jealous of her professions as a doctor and a novelist. In an ironic twist of fate, Dusty is now in the same position that he put Brad in a year ago, when Roger (John Cena), Adrianna's more muscular biological father, shows up. Also starring Thomas Haden Church as Leo Holt and Bobby Cannavale as Dr. Francisco. Ferrell is rather pathetic as the try-hard stepfather, and Wahlberg is smarmy as the good-looking biological dad with a hidden agenda. There are the deliberately over-the-top and humiliating moments, but there are not as many bickering scenes between the two men as there could or should have been, overall, it is not all that funny, and a little boring, a below average comedy. Adequate!"
" He he he
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,8,Not as good as the second but still a very great movie mystery watch Will Ferrell and mark are great together
" Pretty good
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,7,"Nothing mind blowing but a good laugh on the couch. Some of the jokes are a bit cringey but at least there's a good moral to the story. The mom was kinda a nobody character though, she could have been much more."
" Stupid, Funny at times.
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,5,This movie is pretty stupid but it has its moments at times. I died laughing when Brad hit the cheerleader in the head with a basketball.
" This movie makes you so mad, and not in a good way
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,2,"The point of this movie seems to be to make you feel really frustrated and desperat on behalf of the main character. This is not new. The problem is that it is so exaggerated that it's unrealistic. The main character is exposed to unbelievably unfair situations and you're suppose to believe that the other characters don't see the unfairness, but it just doesn't work. Why would you believe that the mother suddenly doesn't see the obvious manipulation by the biological father and takes his side, when she herself explaines to the main character and the viewers that he can't be trusted in any way. It's not even a situation where you really would take the bio. fathers side. If done right this feeling of frustration can work really well, but it just doesn't work. Plus the movie's kinda sexist. It seems that it's still mainstream to think that boys shouldn't hit girls, and they shouldn't, but why for the love of God should they hit other boys? And the scene I'm referring to here is not even that funny, it only concentrates around this don't-hit-girls-even-though-they-are-older,-bigger-and-extremely-mean thing. And then they say that she probably just likes him?! Is this 1960?"
" Funny
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,9,This movie will help teach kids about stepdads. Two dads are better then one.
" Funny, Average Comedy
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,6,"The best way to describe this movie is, average. A PG comedy that's easy going, predictable and might make you laugh. It's not bad, and it's not awesome either, just something to waste time with that might make you laugh, wont make you feel bad and you probably wont remember the next day.If you're a big fan of Mark Walberg or Will Farrell, you'll probably enjoy this film. Mark is showing off his muscles more then ever. Will, still acting the stupid helpless guy. All in all, a good time waster movie."
" Bit of a strange one, for me
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,7,"'Daddy's Home' is a bit of a strange one, for me.Solid enough plot and a good cast, but the film didn't make me laugh all that much - it tried to shoehorn the morality aspect into it too much. The end scenes were actually the most enjoyable part, not in a negative way either - I genuinely liked the ending, just everything before that was average."
" One Of The Best Comedies Ever
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,10,"One of the best comedies ever. Whenever you think someone has hit the punch line of a joke someone else expands on it, then another person expands upon that...the jokes can just go on and on its amazing! I was doubling over with laughter through the whole film! And it's a really intelligent comedy too! You'll especially appreciate it if you are a father. A must see for any Dad, or anyone who loves to laugh!"
" Ferrell and Wahlberg Are Back!
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,6,"I love the combination of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. They have such a fun exchange between them. Ferrell is goofy, and Wahlberg is serious and aggressive. It's perfect!Daddy's Home is about a family with a stepfather. The real father of the two children return, and tries to push the stepfather out of the picture. From then on, it's a battle of wits between the two. Eventually they learn to live together in harmony.I thought it was really funny. I was absorbed all the way though. Hannibal Burres is also really funny in this movie, and his appearances are so random. The kids are fun to watch. It's a very family oriented movie. There's also a funny scene with Ferrell at an NBA basketball game where he gets too drunk and ends up throwing a ball at a cheerleaders head.All in all good movie.Watch it!6 stars"
" Actually surprised.
",2019-11-29 00:00:00,7,"Let's face it, nowadays it's a major surprise when a comedy actualy makes you laugh and for me, Daddy's Home shockingly did that, and I mean shockingly because I had no expectations at all. Previous Ferrell and Wahlberg pairing didn't prove effective last time I checked, mainly the reason I was unsure about this film. The plot certainly serves as a seemingly expected recipe for comedy, even though most comedies are horrible at executing properly plots that on page appear to be funny. Rivalries between two opposites most of the time deliver, and this is no exception.
Both Ferrell and Wahlberg play their parts correctly, each providing their own funny input to a hilarious cocktail that is their chemistry together, something I feared it wouldn't turn out so well.Daddy's Home proves you can still make comedies with a small but effective plot and an adequate execution with two great leads, forging its weight on the efficiency of the pairing. Lighten up and enjoy."
" Linda Cardellini is....
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,2,"The most beautiful woman on the planet. Step aside Gal Gadot, the real super woman is Linda. Ok, enough drool. No one could save this family comedy and Will Farewell hasn't been funny since OLD SCHOOL days. I'd rather watch pizza rolls burst in these microwave."
" Basic but fun...
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,7,Daddy's Home is oozing with likability with Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg in this family comedy. The story of a step father and a father fighting for the love of the kids is unique to me at least and some hilarious antics ensue. I like how the Will Ferrell's and Mark Wahlberg's characters hate each other then they learn how to be father's at the same time to the kids. Love Griff and the boss in the movie are two great stand outs. Really enjoyable comedy.
" There is always a bigger fish in the sea
",2019-07-08 00:00:00,4,"Not the first time I see the Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell duo; and as always it's a macho & wimp cocktail stirred but not shaken. The same I can say about myself after watching the dad rivalry that stretches for good hour and a half, but why is that?Contrast is the key to attract attention to the picture, and we see it everywhere. Literally, each breath of Dusty by Mark Wahlberg is countered rickety by Brad (Will Ferrell), every cool trick slammed by a disastrous pirouette. Once or twice it's funny, but after the plot becomes as predictable as obesity after McDonalds.Nevertheless, I think that out all of the mess we can dig a bunch of witty and cracking jokes from fit and cool Mark. He never fails to deliver unexpected refreshing breeze amidst the stale stink of rotten vegetables. Honestly, more than a half of the jokes are even lower than a toilet humor and force a desire to scroll further to the end.Still wondering what did I just see, I would say that there are a few good moments that make you appreciate being yourself but overall for me it's a total disposable comedy that passes in your memory as NASCAR racers by the vigilant fans - blink and you'll miss it. The only difference is that you will not expect the second circle with a flaming desire."
" WARNING!!! Major spoiler for Frozen in this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,8,"Seriously, they straight up give a major spoiler for Frozen (not the horror movie, the one with Elsa) in this movie as if it were nothing. What is wrong with them?!!?!?!? What if someone hadn't seen it yet?Anyway...I think people watch this as a straight comedy and hate it for being a bit painful.But although it's delightfully comedic, I think this movie has more to it than that; it's a charming story of people competing for the love of the same people and their attempts to fulfil the role of a father. The nurturing step dad verses the mega sexy biological father in a test of machismo, daring and cunning.It goes to a dark place because the pains we go through to be the best parent and spouse we can be are tough, especially as we unintentionally challenge the traditional nuclear family.Expect an explosive bout of head butting as two very different people learn to see from the other's point of view. It's an idea we've seen before but it's fresh with its handling and tone.Watch if you want a lot of cheap laughs and a very intelligent application of character, motivation and conflict."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,5,"Meh. had lots of funny parts but lots of jokes fell flat or felt corny or forced. and the story was pretty stupid and followed the same plot formula as so many other comedies (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
common comedy plot formula: 1 couple is happy. 2 conflicts escalate. 3 husband messes up and wife is mad at him. 4 husband wins her back and redeems himself. also I normally try not to over analyze the story in a comedy movie but the part where she made him move out because he went crazy at the basketball game was just so absolutely ridiculous. There was no previous tension that showed they were having problems, all they showed earlier in the movie was that he was the greatest husband and dad of all time, but he messes up one time and she kicks him out? That makes NO sense. terrible wife."
" FAMILYFUN
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,8,I Love basically any Will plus Mark movie but this one is just all that great.Must watch
" Best comedy in years
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,8,"As usual Ferrel is excellent in his role as the step dad and Wahlberg playing whatever role is required of him brilliantly.I have now watched this numerous times, due to how enjoyable and funny it was.If you enjoy a comedy, particuarly the type that does not have childish humour in it. you will love this."
" One of the most irritating worst movie i have ever seen
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,1,"This movie was so disappointing that it prompted me to write a review.Unfortunately I'm forced to give it a minimum of a 1 star rating, when it actually deserves 0 stars.Sara what disgusting non actress."
" Funny but flat
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,4,"Albeit a funny movie, it just doesn't have the grandeur that I come to expect from these two great actors. I absolutely loved the Ferrel/Wahlberg combination in The Other Guys, but it's just not as great in this film. Don't get me wrong it has it's moments where it's truly funny, but it also has moments where it's just too much."
" Can't decide how ridiculous it wants to be
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,6,"Daddy's Home can't decide how ridiculous it wants to be. In some parts, it acts like a straightforward situational comedy, but then at other times it is completely cartoonish. It also wanders between family-friendly entertainment and immature innuendos without finding its footing on either side. And yet, for some reason, I still found myself somewhat enjoying it. What's up with that?"
" Small laughs. Pretty typical
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,5,Tried to like it. It seemed to get funnier as it went on. Lots of corny parts. Put this on if you're not doing anything
" Average
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,7,"As expected, this film was average - 7/10 stars if you ask me."
" DADDY'S HOME
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,10,"DADDY'S HOME is a laugh, once through the ceiling a grown man fell on a fork and died being a robber."
" a comedy about being a step parent
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,2,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows the struggle that step parents go through to relate. The direction and screenplay are sub-par. The casting and acting are sub-par. All in all I would give this two out of a possible five stars.
" A REALLY HILARIOUS MOVIE
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,10,So funny and cool movie but it has an awkward story but if you wanna just laugh and have fun it's a good choice.
" Terrible.
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,1,"I can't pinpoint exactly why. But it was just a really predictable movie. Not engaging. Annoying. Waste of time. 
Watched this in cinema- I've never walked out a movie before. 
I've never left a movie review before either."
" Excellent
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,10,Will is hilarious in everything. This is a great funny family movie.
" Terrible movie
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,1,"My god this movie just doesn't end. This could be used as a torture technique. Just doesn't go anywhere. I could say how unrealistic this is, but I'm sure I'd get people saying Will Ferrell doesn't make movies that are supposed to be taken seriously. No what he makes are movies that would make a great 5 minute skit on SNL and has no idea how to take it past the fifth minute."
" What a Duo!
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,10,"The pairing of these two actors is like two stars colliding! Such chemistry! They play off of each other like they've been doing it their whole lives! This movie is HILARIOUS! From beginning to end, a truly marvelous movie!"
" It was ok
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,6,Some jokes were bland some were ok the acting was horrible.
" funny classic Will Ferrell type comedy
",2018-06-14 00:00:00,7,I enjoyed this movie very much love Will Ferrell and having Mark Wahlberg in the mix in a dad vs dad comedy not had the chance to see the second movie yet but if you're looking to giggle the night or day away id choice this movie slightly slow on the start up but so picks up
" cringe, cringe and more cringe
",2018-06-13 00:00:00,1,"I can't believe that these actors actually read the script and said ''yes, I'll do that'' and actually did it. This movie isn't funny. It doesn't make sense. In a cartoon like fred flintstone, it's clearly indicated that it's a cartoon and they make all sorts of unrealistic things like using dinosaurs as appliances, or talking to aliens. But this movie just has these moments where you think ''please stop insulting my intelligence''. This movie might be entertaining for an 8 year old, but I think it poisons their mind. It tries to make people think how ''the stay at home dad is a beta male loser who has no backbone, and the alpha male is the cool dude!''. No, the alpha male is the one who raped your mother and hits you, is unemployed and causes you trauma. The ''bad boy'' is not the ''cool father''. And no 40 year old is a beta male loser with no backbone.Apart from that, it just doesn't make sense why they let that bad boy loser in the house. It's like a massive plot hole within a plot hole within a plothole, full of unfunny jokes and cringy moments."
" THE KING IS A GUEST IN HIS CASTLE
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,7,"This is a light near-family comedy. Brad (Will Ferrell) is the step-dad who tries very hard at being accepted by his wife's children. Just when he is making a break through, their real father (Mark Wahlberg) shows up. He is super cool and has AC/DC swagger music. Brad works as an executive at a light Jazz radio station. Wahlberg appears to be an iron man mercenary.As expected there is a testosterone battle between the two. Sara, the wife (Linda Cardellini) reassures Brad, but the audience has to wonder if having a buff Mark Wahlberg part time is not better than having Will Ferrell all the time.The comedy is in part slap stick and at times adult as the guys drop their pants and body parts are compared with their backs to the camera. The story was formula and many jokes were on the stale side. The boss (Thomas Haden Church) for me was the highlight of the film as he tells stories of his various ex-wives in an attempt to help Brad...or not.Guide: No f-bombs, minor swearing. No sex, some sex talk. No nudity. Wahlberg shirtless."
" Amazing!!
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,10,I have to say that Daddy's Home is one of my favorite movies ever!! It is incredibly funny and Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg make a fantastic team in movies. My favorite character is Griff! He is soooo funny! Everything he says just makes me laugh every time I watch this! I give this movie a 10/10 in my book!
" ""The concept is good, even if the execution is formulaic""
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,6,"2010's THE OTHER GUYS, which starred Ferrell and Wahlberg in the lead roles, was a surprisingly enjoyable blend of over-the-top humour and witty dialogue. It was also a great showcase for its two leads, bouncing off each other like they'd been doing this for years. It's therefore perhaps a little surprising that it's taken five years for the duo to team up again, though this time the roles require them to be each other's antagonists rather than cop-buddies.Ferrell is Brad, a well-meaning stepfather to his wife's children. He aspires to nothing more than having these kids look up to him as the father figure he's always dreamed of being. However, this becomes complicated by the sudden arrival of the kid's actual father Rusty (Wahlberg], thus beginning a battle of wits between the two for the affection of the kids.The concept itself is a good one and carries potential, even if the execution is about as formulaic as we've come to expect from this sort of comedy. Its central story arc of two rivals competing for something or someone, only to come to the realisation that they might have to work together to achieve a common goal is nothing we haven't seen a million times before. As such, the script never fully allows the two leads to reach their full potential, though there are some undoubtedly laugh-out-loud moments (Ferrell and a curtain-blind, we'll say no more).Director Sean Anders has had a sketchy record so far, with a directorial record that includes 2008's gloriously unfunny SEX DRIVE, 2012's seldom seen THAT'S MY BOY and 2014 inferior sequel HORRIBLE BOSSES 2. It's safe to say he does not carry the weight of expectation on his shoulders. It's because of this that Anders can feel somewhat reassured as DADDY'S HOME is his best film so far, and hopefully a sign that the filmmaker is on his way in the right direction, even if there is still a bit of a way to go.Ferrell, not always used to playing a character as mild-mannered as Brad, has to tone down the usual schtick, only allowing himself a few fleeting glances of that glint in his eye that suggests he's just had the most ridiculous yet awesome idea ever. Wahlberg continues to show he is a lot more restrained when approaching comedy. As Rusty, he channels his inner-douchebag to create a guy who is actually not really very nice at all, with few qualms about wrecking Brad's life if it means he can get what he wants. He's a difficult character to like, or at times even find funny. The inevitable conclusion dictates that there is some character development by the end that really doesn't feel very true to Rusty's character, only serving to highlight the unfocused nature of the script these guys are working from.In the supporting roles, Linda Cardellini brings a real sense of warmth to the role of Ferrell's wife and Wahlberg's ex that could easily have been a throwaway part in lesser hands. As Ferrell's boss, Thomas Haden Church fares less well; not really possessing the comic timing to land the jokes he's presented with. In fact, you can't help but wonder that his part may well have been written with a different actor in mind. Finally, Hannibal Buress milks a role that is essentially not a lot more than a running gag.DADDY'S OUT will no doubt appeal to those after a more cuddly comedy, and there are a few decent gags to be had here. However, in the end this just feels like a bit of a missed opportunity, let down by the restrictions of its family-friendly rating."
" Good Comedy!
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,6,"Will Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg, Linda Cardellini and Thomas Haden Church star in this 2015 comedy. Ferrell (Anchorman) plays Brad, a mild-mannered, radio host who tries to be an ideal stepfather to his wife's kids. Things start well, until he meets Dusty (Wahlberg), Sara's (Cardellini) ex-husband who competes with him to win them over. Brad and Dusty eventually become friends and help each other. Church (Spider-Man 3) plays Brad's boss, Leo. Ferrell and Wahlberg are great in this and together as they were in ""The Other Guys."" I recommend this good comedy."
" Great cast team-up = a hilarious flick
",2018-02-07 00:00:00,8,"I found this funnier than most critics did, but it's one of Will Ferrell's better recent comedic films, and adding Mark Wahlberg to the equation made this film a hit for me. Great laughs and simple fun. A well deserved 8/10 from me"
" it is what it is
",2018-01-30 00:00:00,6,"That ""Daddy's Home"" stars Will Ferrell as a straight-laced stepdad having to cope with the cool original dad (Mark Wahlberg) should tell you all that you need to know about it. Pretty much the whole thing is a series of gags as the two dads vie for control over the family, with no shortage of crude humor. I suspect that they enjoyed filming it, especially the motorcycle scene. I will say that when it comes to slapstick comedies about parents, I preferred ""Bad Moms"" and its sequel to this one, but there's still no lack of fun here. Good times."
" You should better watch something else
",2018-01-03 00:00:00,5,"Will, the ""black widow"" of Hollywood is back! His voice isn't that loud, his behaviour isn't that strident, but he has company to plus his negative sides, right? Although I'm not a fan of this guy called Ferrell (I don't even plan to, either), nor of his ""amigo"", Mark, the two of them make a pretty good team together, I admit. They seem to have some chemistry in between, which helps with their acting. But not enough. The movie still lacks a lot things and misses the main point of comedy, to entertain people. If you're a parent, go play with your kids outside, you won't miss anything, I promise!"
" The worst movie I have ever seen. Just terrible.
",2017-12-30 00:00:00,1,"I really liked watching the other guys so I thought their might be some of the same chemistry here with Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell. 
Boy was I wrong. This movie is unbelievably bad. Unfunny, poorly written, terrible story just a mess. 
The story itself is just bad. Its unbalanced. Plus their are some really random things like an out of nowhere dance off with Bill Burr near the end of the film which is just cringe worthy. Also the motorcycle scene. What in the world. Do not believe the other reviews I have no idea how people could like this"
" Just okay...
",2017-12-17 00:00:00,4,"Has some decent comedy but sometimes becomes too silly or cruel in its manner. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg can be quite good actors, but the performances are quite basic. I like the way Farrell's character really wants children, which is unconventional. Lina Cardellini's character is kept to the sidelines and has little development throughout the film. She often becomes a plot hole by letting Whalberg's character get away with far too much! Furthermore, some of the comedy can be funny. Like some of the back and forth between the fathers can be entertaining. However, some jokes really fall flat and needed a lot more work. Certain scenes like the basketball scene are far too cruel, we are supposed to root for the main dad but this scene makes it incredibly hard to feel anything for him. The cinematography is very dull and uninspiring, it could of added to comedic scenes if used effectively. There is a quiet a funny cameo near the end, which was a little unexpected. Overall a few decent laughs but better comedies are out there."
" Another ok Will Ferrell movie
",2017-12-13 00:00:00,7,"I don't know he seems to be high expections for a Will Ferrell comedy these days but he's just not delivering. Yes this movie was good I laughed don't get me wrong it's just missing that something I didn't belly laugh like I did with Anchorman or Step Brothers. You hope to have comedy on that par especially with Mark Wahlberg in it because again when the two of them were in The Other Guys I cried with laughter this I didn't found it kind of boring in parts.
Nothing against the actors everyone played their parts beautifully just could do with a bit more punch."
" Truly Shocking Film
",2017-12-09 00:00:00,3,"The worst kind of Self indulgent American Claptrap - which is meant to double as funny, entertaining and ultimately a lesson in life.This film is basically about massaging the ego of the dreadful Mark Wahlberg - as if he doesn't love himself already?Even my wife and daughter, who can usually handle any level of mediocrity, admitted this was awful.Don't waste 90 minutes of your life."
" Daddy Is Home Baby!!!
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,5,"I expected better from this movie, I will admit the jew himself ""Will Ferret"" and ""Mark Gangbang"" make a good duo. They were good in ""The Bad Guys"" but this movie wasn't the best. All my autistic friends like this movie but some of them probably like Elf as well the dumb ba*****s. By the title of this movie I thought I was in for some Step-Dad and Daughter porno but I was heavily misguided. When I watched this movie all I could think about was, ""Sh*t I wish my dad came home"" but sadly just like this movie he disappointed me. I give this a 5/10 f***s given."
" Sometimes very funny, at other times just try-hard
",2017-11-24 00:00:00,6,"""Daddy's Home"" is a 95-minute award-winning comedy movie from 2015 that recently returned to the headlines because a sequel is coming out these days that adds the legendary Mel Gibson to the cast, but we will talk about that one later. Today the focus is on this one we got here. It is among the most known career works by writer and director Sean Anders and the story can be summarized quickly. Will Ferrell plays a family man, only problem is the two kids are not his, but from his love's previous relationship. And when that man (played by Mark Wahlberg) enters the family's life again, it is not helping Ferrell's character's plans at all for the kids to finally accept him as their co-dad if you want to call it like that, especially as Wahlberg is (apart from the issue of responsibility) the perfect man, but not really the perfect dad. This is 100% about the comedy for me. There were some moments where they slightly tried to make a statement on good parenting and emotions, but these were really not too memorable at all. But it's fine as the film never takes itself seriously at all. Ferell is the MVP here without a doubt, but he also has the best material and he only has very few moments when he is missing the mark. It sure helps too that for the most part he is next to a relatively limited actor when it comes to comedy at least.Some parts I liked a lot indeed. For example the very ending with the inclusion of John Cena and the turned tables. Or also the ""racism"" parts about the Black buddy. And there are more fairly hilarious sequences for sure. You will recognize them when you see them. Oh yeah and Linda Cardellini is still as sweet as it gets. What else? Sadly, there is negative too. The film is pretty generic and predictable at times, like with the big conflict in the second half that has Ferrell's character somewhat move out. But did anybody think that Wahlberg would really take his place and then the film ends? Or that he won't fail again with responsibility? Hell no. Even if that was a nice idea to turn the tables again. There weren't really any moments at all when the cast disappeared into their characters that much that I felt like I was watching genuine, actually existing people. Admittedly you cannot blame the actors too much as the script's constant craving for humor made it really difficult for them. There are two sequences that certainly can be considered among the film's defining parts, but both went horribly wrong, namely the basketball part (small cameo by Kobe Bryant) and the dance parts near the end (Ferrell's character would never ever have dances topless there all of a sudden). It was a reference back to the idea of dancing to solve problems and conflict, but it just felt wrong. And they quickly built in a new antagonist there to make sure we don't really see Wahlberg's character as such (anymore). We should accept him as a friend eventually. This also explains the scene after the fast forward where we also get served the idea that he really no longer is interested in taking Ferrell's character's place as he has his own family now. So yeah, I think it was an entertaining watch and this one is worth seeing once, maybe twice. Sadly at times they just did not manage to restrain themselves in their attempts to make this a funny watch and the result is sadly that it feels absurdly over the top. But luckily, the good is still more frequent than the bad and I also liked the dialogue writing here for the most part, which was smarter and wittier than I initially expected. Overall, I give this project a thumbs-up and recommend checking it out."
" It is a funny and charming film.
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,7,"Daddy's Home (2015) This is a comedy about a mild-mannered step-father (Will Ferrell) who vies for the attention of his wife's children when their biological father (Mark Wahlberg). Although the film was panned by critics, it was very successful and grossed $242 million worldwide. It is a funny and charming film."
" Yes. Yes I Did Rate This A 9/10
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,9,"(Flash Review)I know that is a crazy rating for a silly comedy but the jokes were really funny and worked for me as well as exceeding my low expectations. I can totally understand rating this a 4-6/10. For me, compared to the last several dumb comedies I've watched, it actually made me laugh hard. The plot, at its core, was a good carrier for the over the top surprising and comedic scenarios. Onto the plot, which is about a step dad who is newly married to a wife with two elementary age kids and suddenly her ex-husband re-enters their lives with the hopes of winning his family back. Ferrell, who is the new husband, plays a kind-hearted, emotional and gentle man while the ex is Wahlberg who is of course strong, brash and intimidating. The two men joust back and forth trying to prove they are the better father figure with their varying personalities and skills. Cue escalating and sensational testosterone battles. Who will end up winning the family? Will the two learn any moral lessons during their many fiascos? Ferrell is on his game as Wahlberg plays off of him well; often shirtless. In fact, there was one scene where the two are talking and Wahlberg is constantly doing push-ups or pull ups. Pretty random and oddly amusing. A good reason to drag a female guest along to the movie. Ha. Above average for this genre."
" A nice, comedic film
",2017-10-06 00:00:00,8,Daddy's Home (2015) is a meaningful and funny movie. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg performed well in this movie. The movie has it's fun moments and sentimental moments. The Climax of this movie will put a smile on your face. It's a film that every father should see because it contains a beautiful message for them. So feel free to watch the movie with your family and have a good time.
" One of the best comedic movies I've seen lately.
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,9,"Y'know, I am the kind of guys who's really skeptical about comedy stuff. But this movie had it all; no overused jokes, all different kinds of comedy (Expressional comedy, dirty comedy, non-dirty one..etc).Whenever the joke feels insufficient or unsatisfying , the writing -afterwards- makes it even better by STORMING IN with a better joke. I am not saying every single joke was original, but it certainly fit the movie, and everything felt like in place. The acting is just so good, two of my favorite actors paired up and gave us one of the most well-written greatly comedic movies.It is so underrated, I don't think this deserves 6 at all, if anyone is being skeptical, it's these guys who's making tra-sh of this movie. And what's really questionable is the popularity, really ? This deserves to be FAMOUS, more than those unworthy movies (yep, whichever came to your mind rn). The storyline was pretty convincing as well. The ending man ... Are you kidding me ? One of the most unexpected actors got in the mix.I'd recommend this movie to everyone, especially the teens, it is so good, and leaves a flavor of contentment and fulfillment inside you.9~10/10."
" Being parents mean
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,7,"A great family subject movie, some silly yet interesting, typical comedy happy ending. *What do I think?
 I am super annoyed with irresponsible parents. Giving a birth is just a small journey, even pregnancy is just 40 weeks, not to speak of the travel time of a man's sperm. Yet raising a child is a life journey, it is not easy to be a responsible parent, let alone a stepdad. But the stepdad character works very hard to gain his trust with his stepchildren and treats them like his own, I really fond of him!*What I learned?
Learned a word oriental from this movie, it is politically incorrect to use this word, and the admonition has the force of law under federal and New York State documents. No wonder I never heard this word before."
" 90 minutes of seeing someone getting kicked in the groin
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,3,"I think I'll put as much thought into this review as the writers did for this movie. Will Ferrell is the dorky step-dad. Really nice but uh oh the kids don't like him. Girl kid says random mean things and has advanced vocabulary for her age and is articulate when convenient. Starting to connect with boy kid but not quite there! Uh oh their real dad is coming home. He is super cool Mark Wahlberg! His hair is slicked back. Can you guess what he drives? A motorcycle! Not a stupid Ford Flex (Hahaha cute self-aware product placement!). Will Ferrell is kind of a wet-blanket and Mark Wahlberg sweet talks himself into staying with the family. Who can tuck the kids in better? Marky Mark of course! He's so cool! Can Will Ferrell drive that motorbike? He can try! Ooops he drove through the house and got stuck in the wall. Don't worry Marky Mark has his shirt off and will punch you out. You're such a dork compared to him! Now they hired someone to fix the house but Marky Mark makes Will question his masculinity! Send him away! Uh oh he's black! Now you feel racist and it's Hannibal Buress so obviously he will call you out on it, silly! Don't you feel dumb! Don't worry, cue the montage of you being a cool dad helping the kids in sports and after school activities. The audience can see you're the unsung hero cool dad Will! Oh no, you cam home and Marky Mark built a tree-house and a half-pipe with Hannibal! Now he's living at your place now too! He's so kooky as well, always commenting on family issues when he shouldn't! Oh Hannibal, you big goofball! Will is now going to prove he can skateboard and be cool! He probably won't hurt himself. Oh he died. Yes he literally dies and Marky Mark brings him back in a ""hilarious' sequence where he tells all the kids to stay calm before calling 9- 11. This movie is so fun and unpredictable. How will it end? Read on! Earlier we find out for no reason Will is sterile but it wasn't for no reason because Marky Mark says she does want a kid! Now they go to the clinic and the doctor thinks Marky Mark is the best, his penis is huge and he has the record for the most sperm and his balls are perfect. Will has weird balls and then he goes to jack it and the curtains fall down and a whole office birthday party sees his sad presumably small dinky. Oh you can't catch a break! Blah blah blah he has early Christmas and tries to make himself look better to the kids. He gets Lakers tickets for the family but Marky Mark comes too and then he knows the Lakers trainer (Of course) and then they get court-side seats without Will. He mad and randomly yells at the kids and mom gets mad. I almost forgot there's a mom because her character barely has any purpose other than decide on which wonderful man to fight for. I think she has a job because at one point she was wearing heels but who can be sure. Those type of things would just get in the way of the comedy! Who's Bechdel and why are they giving me tests? Anyways, Will gets drunk at the NBA game but he wins the half-court throw because why not. Oh hey Paul Scheer, you're in a movie that you would probably mock on your podcast. Will so drunky he throws the ball at a cheerleader's face. Ooops!!! He wants another throw. He hits a child in a wheelchair?!! He can't catch a break at all! This goofy movie! And he is kicked out of the house. We're almost done, I think. Marky Mark is gonna be super awesome dad and win his wife back because she is a prize to be won, okay. Oh no he gets annoyed about waiting in line with his new car, to pick up the kids. He drives off!!! Now Will is with Thomas Hayden Church who has Colonel Saunders facial hair because why not. He's probably the funniest character in this garbage anyway so I'll give him a pass. Now Hannibal shows up to tell Will that Marky is skipping town. What next? Will goes and gets Marky Mark and they go to the daughter's dance thing or whatever together. On his motorbike together because funnier, okay? Now the bully thing with his son gets tied up here that I forgot to mention earlier because it's dumb and just adds to Will being a doormat and loser character because it's just the way to do comedy! Looks like the bully is a girl! Twist! And the dad is Bill Burr. Is Marky Mark gonna fight him? Almost! Will suggests dance off instead! Let's undercut everything and just have a dance off! This is superb! Hilarious! Does the wife take him back? Do you have any doubt? Course she does. Now Marky Mark has a literal castle next door because he got so rich because of his job as the jazz radio voice at the station that Will worked at that I forgot to mention earlier because it was also stupid, I mean clever and there's so many clever things packed in here that I miss some. Well the jazz station makes a lot of money because reasons and they can pay him millions and millions it's a great gag don't worry about it. And he has a Ford Flex, Will was right it's great. And now he has a new wife who has a kid already. And they had a dad. Looks like shoe is on the other foot! Who could it be? John Cena! Duh! So perfect! Can't wait for the sequel."
" Greatly disappointed in the language
",2017-06-15 00:00:00,1,"Not a family movie. The amount of bad language makes this movie unwatchable by most normal families. There was no need for it. Words which little kids need to be protected from a while longer until they are teenagers.The premise for the movie was a great idea but it was poorly executed. It was also extremely predictable. I was bored enough to walk out of the room about the 1/3rd mark. I watched the rest of it from a distance catching some funny scenes but then ended up turning it off because of the language.Will Ferrell plays his typical part and Mark Wahlburger does his typical part. The kids are annoying little brats who would have been four when their daddy left them, so the idea that they know any thing about their dad and ""how cool he is"" isn't logical.Complete failure."
" not a movie for children of any age
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,1,"Interesting concept, but the adult theme is way too much for children. A fertility doctor, process to get sample from prospective dad, discussion of male genitalia is completely inappropriate for children and who, above child age, would be interested in this level of detail? Since when did age 13 become mature enough to delve into such an adult theme? Never, that's when. I would have been embarrassed if I'd taken my son to see this and would have left the theatre immediately and demanded my money back."
" Better then expected
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,8,"It took me I while to watch this film but when I did I thought it was great. Easy to watch and funny. Surprisingly funny. I love Will Ferrell and Mark Walberg in this and I adored the moment the motorbike guy took off his helmet to reveal John Cena. This film took the meme opportunity. If you haven't seen, I'd recommend it."
" Quite funny...
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,7,"This is perhaps one of the better Will Ferrell movies in years, and I was more than genuinely entertained by the storyline as I sat down to watch it, though I did so with no particular expectations as I feared it would be another run-of-the-mill mass-produced standard comedies. But I was proved wrong, luckily so.The team up of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg worked so well, because they had amazing on-screen chemistry, and they each brought something very unique to the movie. Will Ferrell brought his usual comedic charms, while Mark Wahlberg of course brought his rugged appeal and bad boy approach. But it just all worked out nicely together, and this was definitely a great recipe for a hilarious movie.Sure, the storyline was fairly generic and straight forward, but you quickly look past that because the is a lot of hilarious situations in the movie, situations where both Ferrell and Wahlberg get to shine in each their own rights.I was laughing hard and loudly many times throughout the movie, and if I have to pick one single scene to represent the entire movie, it would be the scene where Brad Whitaker (Will Ferrell) have taken seat on Dusty Mayron's (Mark Wahlberg) motorcycle and it loses control of it. That scene had me laughing so hard and I went back to watch it two or three times.The characters in the movie were also quite interesting, especially because their are very charicatured versions of stereotypes. But it works nicely because of the acting talents hired to portray the characters and roles. I did think that it was a shame that Thomas Haden Church wasn't given a bigger and more prominent part in the movie, because he could also have contributed a lot more to the movie than what he was allowed to do.""Daddy's Home"" is really an entertaining comedy that will you have laughing hard. And if you enjoy comedies, then you should most definitely take the time to watch it, if you haven't already done so. And regardless of if you are a fan of either, both or none of Ferrell and/or Wahlberg, then the movie is still great to watch."
" Unfaithful Wife
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,4,"The movie ""Daddy's Home"" is a quite awful movie keeping in view the great cast inducted in the movie. Once the divorce has been made why the ex-husband came to see the kids and stayed in the home for a week, either the American's are too broad minded or they don't have the concept of shame at all? The acting of the wife Linda Cardellini was pathetic as being remarried again she is still taking side of the ex-husband and zeroing the new husband in every possible way. What is this happening throughout in the movie and the second husband Will Farrell is being humiliated altogether. What is shown might be a custom or tradition in US families; well it's not a custom in other societies that after the second marriage the ex-husband is that much welcomed in the house as in this movie. The wife tilting sometimes towards the new husband and sometime towards the ex is very strange and quite difficult to grasp. I gave this movie 4 out of 10 being too clumsy and way too different than actual marriage relation."
" Cardellini saves a weak Will Ferrell outing
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,3,"Will Ferrell is so associated with his roles in 'Elf' and 'Anchorman' that I often find it difficult to see him play other parts.However, this is the sort of comedy that he could make in his sleep and to be fair does a good job in his role.It's a one joke comedy really, with lots of irrational things happening to stretch things out. I found it odd that the DVD box touts it as being a 'family comedy' when some of the jokes are inappropriate.Ferrell and Wahlberg have good chemistry, and this is clear throughout, though the saving grace is Linda Cardellini, who I wish would make more films.This is an average comedy that will mainly appeal to those who follow Ferrell's work."
" Solid Comedy; worth a watch
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,8,"Overall: This movie serves its main purpose - It's funny. Everyone who I watched this with was crying from laughter in this movie. I would watch it; it is entertaining enough.Good: All the characters are fun and interesting and the premise is quite cool. It is hysterically funny with lots of jokes due to the drastically contrasting character.Pretty much everyone does a good job acting wise with the two standouts being obviously Will Ferrell and Mark Walhberg. The two kids also do fantastic jobs considering their young age which is to be applauded. The story is okay but the ending more than makes up for it with a heart-warming, full circle end. The cinematography was reasonable and can't be faulted much.Bad: ​The actual story itself was pretty mediocre and was just a scramble of scripted events of them trying to beat each other without any rhythm or structure to them until the end. Linda Carledini's acting was sub-par and just felt lazy and like she wanted a pay check. The ending felt, while clever and funny, like sequel bait which, while I'd love to see, is something I hate in a movie that isn't pre- established as a series and has a satisfying ending.Best Part: 'James and the Giant Peach'MVP: Will Ferrell as Brad8/10"
" Ugh X 10000000000
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,1,"There I was, having a really bad day. Made some dinner and sat down to watch something ""funny"". Picked this POS dreary comedy, even though I can't stand either Will Ferrell or Marky Mark Three Nipples Wahlberg. ""How bad can this be?"" I said to myself. Less than 30 minutes later I beat myself with a wooden spoon I used to stir pasta sauce. This is a pointless TV sitcom-level ""comedy"" that features all the wooden forced laughs you won't laugh at. It features heart-warming goop that you will gag on, like half-frozen Eggos with cheap syrup and margarine instead of butter. It features the overpaid and shrill Will Ferrell as a supernice guy who's so sensitive he gives butterfly kisses to his adopted kids. They hate him, and so will you. Ferrell tries so hard to be a real dad to his children by marriage (don't ask why he can't have any kids of his own, the reason is stupid beyond belief) while his wife stands around and mildly chastises the kiddies for drawing pictures of neo-Daddy with poop for hair.Enter studly no-good ""real daddy"" Marky Mark Three Nipples Walhberg, who wants to reclaim his kiddies by virtue of being a muscleboy who rides a motorcycle and gives out 20 dollar bills at bedtime. Let's not forget he abandoned his kids and wife for selfish reasons. He immediately overstays his welcome, makes sure we see him shirtless, and displays the acting chops that made him famous, like sliced white bread is famous. Obvious rivalry ensues, and you turn off the device you're watching this crap on and are happy it was free. Yes, I'm guilty of poor judgement, but I lived to tell you not to pay attention to this stupidity. You've seen it before. Many times. Ferrell and Marky Mark are past their prime, and this rank exercise in comedy proves it. Ugh."
