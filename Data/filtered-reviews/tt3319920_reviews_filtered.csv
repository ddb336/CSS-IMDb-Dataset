" Slow as molasses...Boring as tar
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,4,"For the love of Mike, I've never seen a movie with a description that had the potential to be so titillating turn out to be so slow, turgid, and uninteresting."
" A warriors deadliest weapon is his mind.
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,8,"To be or not to be...Regression is a very underrated film simply because it correlates your mind to infinite thoughts and ideas.Do military soldiers really practice techniques to make themselves fall sleep within 10 seconds?When you intake LSD, are good and evil images really there?Was Saint Nicholas a real human being?It is what YOU believe. What you perceive. What you think of. What you dream of. YOU. It is all up to you of what you believe."
" ""Based on true events"" ruined it for me (minor spoilers)
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,4,"Because this movie chose to start with ""based on true events"" and set it in Minnesota in the 1990s, I began watching with the bias that there is no real abuse, and this is an example of false recovered memories. So every attempt to create suspense with cult, satanic, or ritualistic abuse scenes and the ""is it real or not"" trope fell flat for me. And those scenes are the majority of the movie. Every character gets to experience their own version of the ""is this really happening or is this in my head."" All those scenes were boring to me, because I had already decided that nothing was real. The movie also seems fully aware of this because it ends on a sentence about regression therapy being now discredited.
There is still a few twists here and there. The effects are also not bad. Camera work is adequate and the acting wasn't bad.
I won't see this again, but if you did not experience the same bias as me you may enjoy it."
" Highly underrated
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,9,"I really really liked the ending of the movie. You realize then, that you yourself have been a part of this mass hysteria. It took me a while to believe that there is no satanic cult. It wasn't cristal clear to me from the beginning. Also I didnt know about the regression therapy and just thought wtf he is hypnotizing this people!! That can't be legal. Lol
Anyway, I guess the low rating is mostly from people who want to believe in the great evil behind things whereas the simple explanation is mostly the right one. ;)"
" Average.
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,5,Looking for something to watch this afternoon and stumbled across this one. I did manage to watch it all but it was extremely difficult to do. Very long and drawn out. If you haven't seen it then don't bother.
" Atrocious
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,2,I don't think I've seen worse acting in my 30 years of life. Watson just can't act.
" A fine Sunday night movie I wish was a little better
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,4,"I scrolled throughy list of movies to watch...and this was on the list.
After watching the trailer, it looked interesting enough.
I like Ethan Hawke, even in bad stuff.
Emma Watson is fine ish. Not a Harry Potter fan...but Ive seen her in other stuff.
Her ""success"" always hinges on the character she's playing/script.It was irrelevant that she was the actress chosen for this. Could have been anyone.Sundays, I want something I can half pay attention to, half do other stuff.
This movie had for the first 40 minutes or so.
Interesting enough to keep me interested and see where it's going.
And a few good jabs at religion.
You're agnostic. You want to, but just can't believe it.But it fails to deliver in the end.
No need to watch again.
And if you're wodnering whether to check it out...just set your expectations low. It will pass 90 minutes or so, but won't satisfy.You people rating it an 8 or above are out of your minds. If this is a 10, then how do you rate another movie that is WAY better than this a 10?
Seven with brad Pitt. 10.
Regression. 10.
Wait. How the fuxk are you rating a masterpiece like Seven and Regression the same?"
" Takes too long to get to its point
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,3,"It's kind of hard to spoil this film since it is based upon ""true events"", then opens up with a case of an alleged ""satanic ritual rape and murder"" as part of the ""Satanic Panic"" that dominated the 80s.
The ""Satanic Panic"" was not at all justified, and the whole alleged string of satanic cults and satanic murders in the 70s and 80s were proved to be hoaxes or otherwise not related to satanism in any way. As such, if this film is claiming to be based on ""true events"", and in particular on a ""regression therapy"" which looks and sounds to me exactly like Hollywood hypnosis, you can tell nothing good is going to come of this.
This film decides to play it straight, with the vast majority of it being taken upon as an actual investigation into an actual satanic cult rape and murder, with a girl Angela claiming her father and grandmother and some other people were involved. The father turns himself in and confesses despite not having any memory of it.
The police employ a psychologist who starts using ""regression therapy"" to try to get the father to ""regress"" to the night he supposedly raped his daughter, whereupon more information comes up that implicates another police officer. From here, officer Bruce Kenner starts having nightmares or otherwise visions of the satanic ritual rape and murder as described by Angela. He listens to an interview conducted with her repeatedly, to the point of memorizing every word of it.
For an excruciating period of time, very little actually happens in the film, as Bruce interviews person after person, the Satanic Panic makes the news night after night, and the already weak case seems to stall to nothing.
Then suddenly right at the end, during a scene or maybe an hour after a scene in which I had nodded off or gotten distracted and missed it, Bruce somehow realizes that one of the Satanic Cultists in his recurring nightmares is actually a woman in a newspaper ad. From there, he somehow comes to the conclusion that the entire cult is nonexistent, and Angela had been lying all along.
A confrontation with Angela later confirms it, but without any evidence and his word against hers, there's nothing he can do. Angela's father refuses to believe it and insists upon pleading guilty despite the fact that he didn't do it.
All of this happens in literally the last 15 or 16 minutes after more than an hour of otherwise plain and boring nondescript police procedural horror with no evidence and no witnesses.
If this was trying to have something to say about the ""Satanic Panic"" of the 80s, it took an awful long time to say very little, if anything. If it was trying to be a mystery, it gave us literally nothing in terms of any threads or evidence to follow. If it was trying to give some cheap thrills and scares, it failed even in that."
" Satanic rituals & child sacrifices
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,8,"Amenabar on orgasm on this one: A variant of the ""everyone's in it except you"" conspiracy genre, that has been done to death. The difference with this is that Amenabar resolves it much more rationally than most of the older films in this genre and that's satisfying and unexpected. So, +1 for that. But if such is the case, what's the purpose of the effects and visual delusions of the main investigator? Well, I suppose just an added bell to scare a bit the viewer. It almost works, even if carried off a bit far. Amenabar seemingly absolves this case as mass hysteria, but as always there are always two sides to every question: It is NOT very clear that ALL similar cases reported/recorded are just delusions or mass hysteria, so at this point looks like he hasn't researched his homework on the issue, even though the film admits that the FBI has been involved in some such cases. Leads one to think that the issue is essentially benign and related to psychology, but that's not quite the case. There ARE such obscure groups of people in existence (Satanists & Devil worshippers), even though the official carriers of these organizations have officially denied any involvement in questionable acts, as such (Search YouTube for documentaries on Satanism Child abuse victims, etc). Of course, if you are stupid enough - as an adult to involve yourself in such organizations, you'll just have it coming, so overall, the movie misses that point: -1 for that. A wider more well-rounded perspective story, including dubious or questionable (perhaps even unsolved) cases would've been more satisfying and would prompt the viewer to think the issue a bit more, instead of relying on some abstract dream visuals which don't do the issue justice. Overall, quite good, with excellent 1990's cinematography (+1) and good acting by Ethan Hawke and emotionally burdened, dramatic Emma Watson. Watch it if only as the apotheosis of all films Satanic conspiracy all in it horror genre - with an fresh twist."
" Boring snoozefest
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,2,Boring snoozefest. Skip it. Nothing memorable here.
" Good movie! Scary
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,7,I like it I don't know why is so underated. This movie scared me
" Strange high drama, excellent production
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,8,"It's worth seeing Regression for the talent on display. It's a dark, moody and frantic movie, with strange twists and turns. It looks at guilt and innocence and the part mass media plays defining what we believe. Thus, regression is modern movie. I hesitate to call it a horror movie. Regression is more in keeping with a strange but true tale, be it a very dark one. Horror fans and fans of true crime alike should find plenty here to enjoy."
" Completely forgettable
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,4,"While not the worst movie I've ever seen, it surely was forgettable. That's too bad because I've always held Amen√°bar in high regard. The Others was truly chilling and The Sea Inside was beautiful and gripping. However, given the subject matter, Regression should have been compelling and unsettling. Unfortunately it was dull and surprisingly lackluster. Too bad."
" headtwisting
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,8,"I thought i was immune, but was i wrong this movie got me good. I had the strangest dreams after i saw this movie, were i find my self in limbo between half wake half sleep , one such dream got me terrified, the one about a commercial icescream truck that stops slightly visual in front of my home, where the truck driver runs up my stairs with heavy steps and stops at the doorstep to my bedroom."
" Regression suppresses the psychological overburden of satanic panic for a hellishly pedestrian thriller.
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,5,"The moral mayhem of satanic abuse hysteria plagued American media primarily in the 80s. County officers charging potentially innocent folk with child abuse claims, including ritualistic injuries. With many states cementing their faith as devout Catholics, the mere mention of Satan and his overwhelming power amongst people sent many into overdrive. Civilians petrified of the outside world in case they see ""cult"" members staring at them in hooded cloaks. The media's mass perpetuation enabled pedestrians to see what they wanted to see. To cause national panic. To issue a story that was a mere fabrication. Susceptible souls, such as the fictional detective Kenner, were caught in the midst of hysteria and hurtled down a route of satanism due to convincing proposed testimonies from apparent sexually abused girls, including Angela.Amen√°bar's psychological thriller persuasively conveys the irrationality and frenzy of satanic abuse hysteria through the conviction of its central character, detective Kenner. A workaholic unable to disconnect his mentality from the case, as he investigates Angela's testimony, which rampantly gears his imagination up to maximum potential when he envisages ritualistic fornication and infant sacrifices. Amen√°bar exquisitely supplies atmospheric fear through grisly environmental shots, especially given the constant torrential rainfall in Minnesota, and acute focus on Kenner's psychological downfall. Thanks to an ever-dependable and committed central performance from Hawke whom, once again, goes one minuscule step further and essentially becomes the character. The minor details from the fatigued eyes to the drained expression illicit an effective portrayal. Its tepid horror is founded upon the visualised imaginations of its characters, with the curative procedure of recovered-memory therapy (RMT) enabling those moments at the hands of psychologist Professor Raines. A collection of unproven techniques that have patients staring into a metronome and attempt to recall the memories based on what the other individuals in the room are spouting out. Much likes its usage in the film, which is minimal to say the least, it proved ineffective and was a catalyst for the mass hysteria.That's not Amen√°bar's main problem. The issue is that it's structured as a thriller, bearing in mind that hysteria is typically based on fabrications and is outlined in the introductory title cards. So with that enveloped into the viewers' minds, the ""thrills"" were inevitably inconsequential given the predictable nature of its plot points as a collective. Amen√°bar inserts a mystery element that teases the idea whether or not Angela's testimony was truth or deception. Organically, it was deemed pointless. A genre splice for the sake of enabling various jump scares and setting up a climactic confrontation that clearly irked many audience members. The mystery strand could've had some grounds for existence had Watson's acting been remotely resonant or expressive. She was monotonously unconvincing and that was a fundamental distraction (should've let Professor Lupin teach her some more Defence Against The Dark Arts!). Her over-acting was obnoxious and Angela's general motive was too menial given the severity of its evolution. Ultimately, the feature's conclusion with Angela's father deterred from the main purpose of illustrating satanic abuse hysteria and coincided with a faith-based resolution. Almost contradictory to a degree.Still, this was panned by both audiences and critics upon its release. A statement that seems somewhat unfair. Whilst the contents of Amen√°bar's feature is inconsequential and underwhelming to say the least, he does conscientiously capture the contagious delirium of mass hysteria through technical brilliance, with the assistance of a sharp central performance from Hawke. Had he focussed on the widespread frenzy totally instead of the inferior victimised case, perhaps many would've been going crazy over this."
" Alejandro Amenabar
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,7,"Best thing: As Ethan Hawke is imagining the ""fornication"" alleged to have taken place in a barn in the middle of a Satanic meeting, we see his visualisation of a naked couple making out materialise inside the car that is parked in there. The Satanic visions are often (intentionally) hilarious. In another film we might be expected to take those same sequences seriously, but anyone who knows the slightest thing about the Satanic Panic will understand why that is not the case here.Worst thing: Sometimes imitates the cheesy supernatural BS movies a little too accurately. When a woman is terrified by a domestic cat, I couldn't help but remember the stupidity of similarly styled movies like ""The Rite"" with Anthony Hopkins or ""White Noise"" with Michael Keaton. Despite the inevitable reversal, Regression can often feel rather more sincere in its depiction of superstitious hogwash than is really appropriate.Alejandro Amenabar is a director who seems to hold an obsession with unusual twists on the concept of the afterlife (Open Your Eyes, The Others) and the opposition of faith and reason (The Sea Inside, Agora). It's a little unfortunate that audiences mainly seem to be disappointed by this film when they discover that there WASN'T a massive baby-murdering conspiracy organised by hooded Satanists - as if that were a massive surprise! (For once, a film claiming to be based on real life actually tells the truth.)The real mystery here is how anyone comes to believe in hooded Satanists if there, in fact, weren't any. It is the subtext that much of what we see in the film is the product of mass hysteria which really made the film interesting to me.As for performances, Ethan Hawke and David Thewlis are both brilliant. I've actually heard some people claim that Emma Watson is the best thing about this film, but it seemed clear to me that her accent wasn't even as convincing as in other films where she's used an American accent before.Perhaps a rather odd comparison I'd like to make is with ""The Witch"". You see, ""The Witch"" showed events as they were described by settlers. Similarly ""Regression"" shows events very much from the perspective of Ethan Hawke's detective character. What we see in the film is the hysteria of unfounded fears from an insider's perspective and that is something common to both films.So what is this film's take on the satanic panic? Well the clue's in the title. The key to everyone believing the crazy statements devoid of evidence so completely is the supposedly ""scientific"" methods of 'hypnotic regression'. This crosses over with some Satan-centred rhetoric on television and at the local Church to produce an explosive combination. One criticism I've heard is that a lot of those coming forth with dodgy statements were much younger than Emma Watson's character and were fed their stories much more forcefully, but I think the filmmakers are keen to show this from the perspective of a well-meaning relateable police officer who is trying to do his job well. That would be a tough sell if he were shown badgering young children in the interview room.While I greatly admired many aspects of Amenabar's previous film ""Agora"" I recognise that it has a number of failings. But Regression was a very interesting and compelling cinematic experience for me and I simply do not understand the hate."
" A lot better than I thought
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,7,"Noticed this got a damn load of hate, honestly..give it a chance.-great acting, especially the lead.
-lighting and cinematography is excellent.
-visuals look amazing, try and watch on Blu-ray if you can.
-story was somewhat decent (minus the ending)
-script is decent and actually engagingConsthe ending...I mean seriously? Just being like ""hey satantanic cults and abuse don't exist, science and regression therapy is false"" Felt like a real cop out, they are indeed real, very real..(maybe someone had some links to them?)If you can ignore that ending it's a decent film to be honest.Just also like to add I went in blind and knew nothing of the story this was based on, so maybe that's why."
" Weird
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,5,"In the end is about deranged people Who imagine things! the question is why they imagine satanic cults and baby sacrifices instead of anything else!? But nobody question that, it seems to me that this movie was made to discredit anyone who speaks the truth about those things which are of course real, just watch the finders and dont be fooled people, satanic cults are real."
" Another great movie from Oscar winner Amenabar
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,7,"I guess the low ratings are from the people who expected a blood gore or jump scare because of the Satanic theme in the movie. I don't want to give away the story so you will miss the fun. This movie is a decent suspense thriller with all the satanic devotion elements and given complete explanation. If you like suspense psychological thriller with some horror elements, then you should watch it."
" Mislabeled but intriguing
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,9,"What a fantastic movie. Based on a true story this was beautifully depicted and the scenery and acting was marvelous. Would have gave full stars except it is not scary enough to be a good horror movie as it was advertised. The genre label didnt match, I found it more of a thriller. Excellent movie I would watch again."
" The answer is in the title of the movie #spoilers#
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,3,"I was rather confused as this movie rolled along, but being aware of all of the false memories that were 'recovered' using regression therapy, and knowing that so many were hurt by false allegations, I hoped that the truth would in the end be discovered. And thankfully it was. A good movie, but so sad in what happens to what happens to the fictional family as a result. But in reality it would have been Angela who would have had the regression therapy. It was though, very interesting seeing how it might work in reverse. One reviewer commented that SRA actually does exist :) I'd like to know where this person found this."
" Good suspense build up but...
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,4,"The movie builds up good suspense but when it comes to justification of the climax, you are dissatisfied.Definitely human brain is not so weak that you just tell them stories and they start to hallucinate.And all 4 people hallucinate?. LOL. Seemed like a comedy ending."
" Critics seems to forget...
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,7,"This film is based on real events. People seem to forget that, when they say the ending was disapointing. Well the end was already written for this movie.
Someone else is claiming that the director protects satanic cults, because no evidence was found. Well again it was based on real events and guess what. No evidence was found.
Everybody has a right to an opinion, these guys are not to be talen seriously.When thats said, I think it was a good movie. Predictable, but a solid thriller."
" Terrible
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,2,This film is so obvious from the get go. America's Salem history all over again. Overwrought and ridiculous. A waste of time as it's neither horror or suspenseful. The title says it all. I can't believe some of these viewers haven't caught on. We know the mid 80's hysteria was caused by the evangelical crowd; there was never any proof anywhere including this amalgamation of stories. It was rumor run amok. Regression therapy has also been debunked. Another 80's-90's social hype. So everything about the story is regressed-non existent.
" Interesting concept
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,8,"Despite a slow start, the movie picks up and engages you really into its stream trying to find out if there is really a satanic angle to it. While the whole time one would think that the dreams are not actual dreams but something happening for real as shown by other horror movies, the case doesn't apply here for once and they are actually dreams result of a mass hysteria, that make you believe there is actually a ghost when there is not.
Not sure of the negative reviews I personally liked it."
" Fairly descent occult thriller.
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,5,"Just like all these lowkey indie thrillers like
Frailty etc. The movie sticks its Landing. There's nothing you havent seen before but the next day you have forgot even watching it.
Ethan hawke Is ethan hawke. His never bad in any roles and And its obvious He's a safe card actor when wanting to make horrors or other things. He han be In a A studio blockbuster and the next week a b level horror like Sinister or the purge. Hermoine Is Always good but what happened to her career? 2019 and I haven't seen her in a long while.
Like a Said ok movie with no suprises."
" Very enjoyable watch - underrated movie!
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,9,"It definitely is worth a watch. I don't see the current 5.7 average rating anywhere fair for this movie.
It is a very good story, great acting by Ethan Hawke as the main actor.
Nowadays, I think people neglect a good story and character-driven plots, when they instead overrate the cheasy superhero CGI action-packed special effects blockbusters, that flood the market.
I wish more films like this were made - the average rating should not be under 7.0 here.
I would give it an 8.0, but upped to 9.0 just to help the unfair score.
An enjoyable movie that I would recommend."

David is Professor Kenneth Raines a psychiatrist who helps a policeman named Bruce (Ethan Hawke) in a strange case of sexual abuse in the 1990s.Cons: But no, this movie becomes a false promise, no one in the cast is a real highlight (not even David himself), it's like an unfinished or badly made episode of The X-Files, it's like watching David as Scully and Ethan as Mulder, the movie tries to scare and suspense you but it doesn't even make it. Harry Potter fans who are anxious to see the ""meeting"" between David and Emma Stone....Well...they will be disappointed because the scenes between them are almost null and there is no dialogue in their characters, I imagine that Alejandro Amen√°bar must have felt a very intelligent man or simply very pretentious when he directed it.

" Creepy but not great.

Plain and simple: the writing just isn't very good. It could have been a decent movie with better writing. There wasn't enough character development for me to buy in to the story and the dialogue was sometimes poor."
" The Fake False Memory Syndrome Foundation probably funded this mess
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,1,"This movie basically is just a bunch of crap to help further the extended abuse of SRA survivors who still can barely make it through life. When it was dubbed the Satanic Panic it helped to de-legitimize all cases of SRA. In other words, anyone who had a repressed memory and claimed the memory was done through a satanic cult was instantly put in the category or truly false cases. Once it was dubbed an SRA case the proper steps were never taken to further examine all the facts. This movie was simply another knife in the heart of true victims of SRA."
" Interesting source material squandered

Ethan Hawke and Emma Watson are both fine actors but I found them very awkward in their roles. They felt miscast and poorly directed. It's not a terrible film from a technical perspective, but by the time the end credits roll you will feel the acute tinge of regret that only comes from wasting 2 hours. If you want a great film about similar subject matter, watch ""Session 9""."

So this is the main incentive to watch this movie, how is he gonna surprise us?The movie itself is really well filmed, you can feel his style in it, so if you are not used to it, you might find it a big strange at the beginning but nonetheless is a movie worth an opportunity. You might find the movie a bit slow at some points, but you spend most of the movie with your eyes open trying to get what is going on and how it is going to end.As for the cast, both leading actors are marvelous in the roles. Ethan Hawke, as he is lately getting us used to, does a pretty good job of his police inspector and as for Emma Watson, who plays the victim, is saying goodbye to Hermione for good, and we don't get reminded of her at all.Don't expect a horror movie cause this is not; it is a suspense/thriller movie nearer to classics like ""The Changeling"" than ""The Howling"".

" I would recommend all viewers voting five stars or less to have a regression and experice this movie all over again.
",2018-10-30 00:00:00,10,"I usually do not watch movies with low rates, but since I really miss Hermione and Remus I just had to <3I loved every part of it, so please do not make this movie the Movie-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named then.Give it one more go - it's really great!"
" Not what you think it's about.
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,1,"This movie is false advertising. I was expecting a horrormovie/thriller. Its just the oppsosite.*MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD*This movie is not about a satanic cult. It's about a lie. And its about mass hysteria.This movie seems to have it all. Great acting, great atmosphere, great creepy soundtrack. But beneath the surface it's not a horrormovie. It's based on a lie.
Had this movie really been an actual horrormovie about an actual satanic cult. With sacrifices of babies and animals and sexually abuse of children and worshipping the devil, it might have been an interesting or even great film.
Instead its all a lie. None of the things that the girl Angela claimed happened were true. She made it all up, because she hated her family.I allow the one star that IMDB, demands, for the acting, atmosphere and
soundtrack.Avoid this, if you expect a horrormovie."
" An engaging thriller
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,7,"Judging by the reviews it seems to be a polarizing film that has determined this, rather unfair, low score. I found Regression to have an interesting premise, well written, crafted and credibly pulled off by stylish director Alejandro Amen√°bar. Writer/director of The Others and Open your Eyes, as well as writer of the English version, Vanilla Sky. A classic thriller with a classic twist. Worth watching."
" A superb thriller.
",2018-06-13 00:00:00,6,A really clever story involving Satanic cults. An unexpected twist gives this movie the edge over other of a similar genre. Well acted especially by Hawke and Watson. Retained for future viewing.
" Well crafted movie, which could've been better
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,7,"I almost didn't watch this as the current 5.7 score is rather low, but I'm still glad I did as I think it was better than that score. Not much, but still enjoyable. It's a ""quality"" movie, where pretty much everything is top notch, but the script sadly lacks. Atmosphere, cinematography, acting and casting all worked well with the exception of Emma Watson. She wasn't bad, but she wasn't good either. She didn't really make me think she'd be a girl from small town Minnesota (?). In the end she was just ""Emma Watson"". It's probably not her fault as she doesn't have a lot of screen time and the character development in general is rather thin.The biggest problem was the script. The movie deals with satanism (and religion while at it), sexual abuse and ofcourse regression. This is a lot for one movie to cover. While the initial story was somewhat interesting, it never really got itself together and didn't know where to focus, which made the movie rather difficult to get a grip of. In the end I was a bit confused about what really had happened. The movie was both confusing and anti-climatic as they kind of swept the whole table clean in the end. This probably makes it sound like a really crap movie, but it was a good watch anyway. Spooky, very strong on dark and moody atmosphere, too bad the story didn't quite match everything else. I'm still giving it a 7."
" Satanic investigation
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,7,"This film has the ability to be a lot better than it was, with a great angle of the satanism abuse, it reminded me of a real life story here in the uk. This one is clearly based on true events, but perhaps wasn't as engaging in the beginning as the end and it's easy to get lost in somebif the story. That being said it's a worthy watch and perhaps one that becomes more clear with a second viewing."
" Boringly executed
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,4,"REGRESSION is one of those psychological thrillers populated by a cast of victims, police, and psychologists. From the first instance I hated the blue/greyed out colour scheme, which makes this look just like all the rest of the coldly realistic thriller/dramas that do the rounds in today's Hollywood. The story is slow-witted and involves Satanic abuse and a woman who has been raped by her own father. There's a conspiracy angle that doesn't go very far, but mainly this is dialogue based. It tries to be worthy and important but feels quite dull and unpleasant at times. It doesn't help that the lacklustre performances of Ethan Hawke and Emma Watson spoil things further, with only David Thewlis proving a high point in the casting."
" A realistic spin on unrealistic events, combined with horrible acting
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,4,"Hawke tries to unravel the abuse of a young woman, suspecting an organized satanic cult. While searching for the thruth, the power of suggestion seems to get to him, making him doubt if he's looking in the right direction.Hawke does a great job of playing a conflicted cop, who puts the victim at the 1st place and only the thruth matters. Unfortunately the movies rhytm is confusing by strange shots and editing making this movie feel rushed. The message is very interesting and makes you wonder how to approach these cases, if they where real. Although based on real events, this is still just a movie and it depends on convincing acting. Which is what Emma Watson doesn't seem to be able to do in this movie. Rarely have I seen such woonde, stiff, uninspired acting which makes the twist in the end fall completely flat.The movie would have been better with more character motivation, and less Emma Watson."
" I don't kill babies
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,5,"Angela (Emma Watson) accuses her father (David Dencik) of molesting her. Detective Bruce Kenner (Ethan Hawke) brings in psychologist Professor Kenneth Raines (David Thewlis) who uses regression therapy and uncovers a huge Satanic conspiracy, one that has been sweeping the nation since the publication of a book on Satanism.The film was half interesting. The problem was having lived through the 1990s while Rosanne Barr was on the cover of every tabloid, I knew exactly where the film was going, and once it got there, the film quickly fell off a cliff. The acting and script was fair. Nothing to write home about.
Guide: F-bomb, sex, brief nudity?BTW. There are currently organized Satanic Temples throughout the US with the largest bring in Detroit (cheap property values). The people in the church do not really believe in Satan. They are atheists who are using Satanism to irk Christians."
" Quite good for a (scary ?) movie (spoiler)
",2018-01-19 00:00:00,7,"I don't know why the rating is low, maybe when people figure out that there is no real demon at the end and all those potentiel evil group doesn't existe, they get so dispointed. But not me, I must say that the logic of whole history is ok, I read some kind of book or article in the real life, people lies and make themself believe in it, creepy. That's why I dont like the 'crocdile' of new Black mirror, our memory is really something subjective.
Back to the movie, the rythem is good, it keeps a tough tension. Worth to look it"
" Spoilers follow ...
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,8,"This slowly unravelling story features a typically intense performance from Ethan Hawke (as Detective Bruce Kenner), and features UK actors David Thewlis (Professor Kenneth Raines) and Emma Watson as the shy young victim at the centre of it all Angela Grey. It is written and directed with great, gloomy, foreboding flair by Alejandro Amen√°bar.The cast are excellent, which is just as well during the early stages of 'Regression'. This first act looks great, but could uncharitably be described as 'a lot of people standing around talking.' This is a necessary price to pay if you are to appreciate and fully understand the twists and turns events subsequently take.The lack of traditional jump scares indicates this is intended as a subtle, thinking person's horror and as such, works very well. Grey's burgeoning friendship with Kenner is charming and you feel pleased she is beginning to see an end to the traumas she has been put through. She is very easy to sympathise with, as Grey discovers. And yet it is a mistake to take anything at face value, because in true demonic possession style, things are not always as they seem.Despite being top billed, Watson isn't in this a whole lot, and yet events circle around the character of Grey. Watson has become a somewhat controversial figure, with some questioning her talents as an actress and others lauding them. It is difficult to know why this is. Perhaps it is because she uses her platform to highlight women's rights; perhaps it is simply because she is educated and successful beyond acting; perhaps it is because she seems successfully to have progressed from child star to adult actress. Or perhaps I am easily pleased (who cares, really?) - I find her quietly impressive here; she holds her own amidst some exemplary performances.Is this a perfect film? Not really - it could have benefitted from losing 10 minutes of run-time, and it needn't have taken quite so long to get going. Also, the final twist could have been given more gravitas. But 'Regression' is a very solid, expertly produced mystery and I enjoyed it."
" Yes, Hidden or Ignored Gem
",2018-01-12 00:00:00,10,"I grew up in a cult. The classic kind from the seventies. And then they disappeared but heavily influenced DC politics. This movie is a close representation of perhaps mass hysteria experienced on all levels of the media and is a good provocation of what it is like to be stuck in a fraudulent system.I give this film the rate of a ten for simply stunning acting, very, very subtle transition from scene to scene, great cinematography, an incredible score and for truly capturing a spirit of mystery and for allowing nonfiction to be fiction or vice versa, to being true to the spirt of a kind of collective mysteria all religious people seem to suffer from and for dealing with a forbidden topic, that is, the one devout Christians most fear. Yes, this film deals with heavy issures but because things like this have happened to others and to me, i cannot say they are not true.Thank you, Ethan, Emma and to Mr. Amenabar."
" brooding atmosphere
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,4,"It's 1990 and satanic cult hysteria has swept the nation. Police detective Bruce Kenner (Ethan Hawke) investigates John Gray who admits to abusing his daughter Angela (Emma Watson). Kenner calls in professor Kenneth Raines (David Thewlis) to use memory regression. George Nesbitt (Aaron Ashmore) is a cop and a suspect. The story is a muddle with limited tension. This movie needs to sell the audience on the supernatural cult before surprising them with a twist. It never really sells the cult idea possibly due to the opening text. I read it as a hysteria unfounded by reality. There is a brooding atmosphere and Hawke has a brooding personality. It's trying to be Se7en without pulling it off. Filmmaker Alejandro Amen√°bar has done much better. Honestly, the cast is more intriguing than the movie. This may function better as a straight up horror but then the final twist is a betrayal of that."
" Solid psychological thriller
",2017-12-20 00:00:00,7,"**** May there be spoilers ****
This is one film that you will need a certain state of mind to appreciate it and enjoy it. The plot, while weak, is gripping enough to keep your attention through the slow pace of the film, Acting is not exactly top notch but good enough to be believable, some better than others. The film will take you, at a slow pace, through a mounting aprehension of a tragic ending, only to defuse it at the very last minutes. Don't expect Hitchcock but it is a very watchable movie that, while leaving a lot of unexploited areas, does wonders on a format suitable for theaters.
Solid direction, a good --not jaded- argument, fine camera and cutting, over average acting, and best of all a cohesive use of the limited resources of a lo-bud production."
" Satanic Sex Cult or Hysteria?
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,7,"It's the 90s in Minnesota. Angela's (Emma Watson) father has admitted he sexually abused his daughter, but he says he has no memory of his actions. Detective Bruce Kenner (Ethan Hawke) believes Emma and must coax the truth out of her, but what is the truth? If you were a teen or adult in the 80s and 90s, there were quite a number of sexual abuse allegations in which satanic cults or rituals were allegedly involved. This story is similar to that time in many ways.Good movie for Halloween if you're staying in. Adult themes."
" Poor performance, incomprehensible plot, disappointing ending
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,4,"Poor performance from Emma Watson in this particular role, not very credible. Luckily, Ethan Hawke makes up for a little of it. For almost the entire movie, you're going in rounds and wondering what is going on. Only the last 10-15 minutes give some revelation and it's fairly disappointing. Sure, you'll keep watching it in the hope someone will explain what is going on, but you'll end up wasting your time."
" Bamboozled!!!!
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,7,"It was amazing! This movie was portrayed beautifully and it had so much tension and such good acting What I didn't really expect was the plot twist!!!! I was just pranked??? And that was great too because people don't expect many cases like that to go south, especially in a horror/thriller film. The ending also shocked me, for the main character to just not suffer that horribly in the end is very rare in these types of movies."
" Well Acted with an Important message
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,9,"I really enjoyed the movie. I thought it was very well acted and would commend in particular the actress who portrayed the grandmother. Both Ethan Hawke and Emma Watson gave strong performances, also. As a criminal defense lawyer, I was happy to see the credibility of psycho-therapy examined; very refreshing. I think the movie calls into question much more than Satanic Ritual Abuse and would hope viewers could make the connection with many other aspects of life. Would highly recommend despite some downright gory and scary scenes."
" Not to bad
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,8,"Psychological thriller with a few suspenseful, sometimes overdone effects, that seem a bit strange i a way. In the end you will realize why though, it is part of the movies message. A bit obvious plot twist also. I enjoyed the film nevertheless, but could not give it a 9 or 10. 8 fits well in my opinion. I recommend to watch it if you are interested in mystery police thrillers (would not call it horror flick). People who review the movie as under 5 have either not payed attention or had unrealistic expectations from the start, I guess."
" Promising but Disappointing
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,5,"Starring: Ethan Hawke and Emma WatsonReview: Regression started off like a pretty good movie. It had a dark, ominous tone. I like Ethan Hawke as an actor. Emma Watson is pretty hot. It seemed like it was going to be a solid movie about questioning one's faith, the brutality of man, and the intricacies of the human mind. It had all the makings of a good movie, but it wasn't one. There were some good parts. The revelations at the beginning were intense and the weird satanic visions that haunted Ethan Hawke were pretty creepy and built suspense. Overall, it was pretty predictable, though. In the age of plot twists, it's pretty common for people to try and guess what it is. Filmmakers don't usually stray too far from my first guess so it's kind of hard to be surprised. Regression's ""plot twist"" was obvious from a mile away, though. It would have done well as a horror movie if it had stuck with those elements, but that's not what type of movie it was. Ethan Hawke and Emma Watson's talents were wasted on this movie just like Ethan and Selena Gomez's were wasted on Getaway (literally the worst movie I have ever seen).What I Would Have Changed: I would have scrapped the psychological aspect of the movie along with the ""twist"" and made it a straight up horror movie about a cop helping a girl who's been abused by a satanic cult. Those were the parts of the movie that made it interesting. The ending pretty much negated all of that.Verdict: I wouldn't watch it again. If you haven't seen it but want to, I'd recommend waiting until it airs on TV to watch it. Or get somebody to rent it from Redbox for you.Follow me: @KallMeKarter"
