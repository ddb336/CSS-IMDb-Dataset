" All That Looks Good Does Not Provide Pleasure
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,4,"The cast, costumes, location, and lighting all glow in this story of a specific and brief time in Princess Grace's and Monaco's existence. Unfortunately, the story is very uneven, and at times simply inept to the point of frustrating and befuddling. It's a shame to waste such a strong cast, Parker Posey who is usually excellent is wasted here and her talents have no opportunity to shine. Frank Langella's character and does fare better but still, Grace of Monaco isn't nearly what it could have been considering the talent involved. I hate to say it but this is a real snoozefest."
" Only covers a short period of her life
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,6,"Nicole Kidman always seems to have sad looking eyes. Did they choose her for that look & was Grace Kelly the same? The problem with films like this is you are watching a dramatic creation and how much of it is true, has to be discovered by more reading! If films are going to tell true stories, I would like them to be true!
The film is fine but only covers a year or so in the life of Grace Kelly. I think a film that covered a longer period would have been great to make."
" Never Read Critiques Before Watching
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,8,"A classic example of a fun and very watchable movie blighted by wrong expectations...biased sentiments...and unfathomable demands.This film clearly states at the start that it is a ""fictional story based on true events""...and as such should be viewed as pure entertainment.It's a small movie with big aspirations...and just plain fun to watch.Strong acting...not easily pulled off...and highly professional.Watched it on Netflix with no expectations...found myself pleasantly and sometimes
emotionally invested in the ""fairytale""...and like all good fairy tales...this is dark in surprising ways.Watch it for the cast...and don't be too harsh."
" Not disGraceful at all.
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,7,"This movie has been on my list for years now and didn't get around to watching it until now because of the overwhelmingly negative reviews. What made me decide to finally watch it is that some critics reviews singled out Kidman's performance.Right off the bat, I will say that the film has one of the worst scripts in a movie and so poorly directed and Kidman's almost perfect performance was in the middle. Those are the two major flaws of the film that the lead cast, Nicole Kidman, has to carry on her shoulder but despite her great effort to elevate the really bad writing, her great performance was botched by the director. Credit to Kidman for being able to pull off a really good ""Grace Kelly"" portrayal. I read a lot of reviews here on IMDB saying Kidman never looked Grace Kelly. Of course she doesn't. Nobody does. It was a huge challenge for her because it was something prosthetic and make up can't compensate. So the film will have to rely on her performance and Kidman delivered. If this was filmed 10 years ago, it would have been a role of a lifetime for Kidman. Despite giving a great performance, Kidman was already too old to play the part. I had no problem with the accent. I have seen some of Grace Kelly's films and Kidman managed to mimic the breathy speaking voice of Grace and even some of her mannerism.7/10 for Kidman's performance, amazing set, costume and cinematography.The highlight of the movie is at the end where the Olivier gave an extremely close up of Kidman while delivering a speech. Great expressive eyes and I wasn't distracted by the botoxed face not by a minute. That was how great Kidman was in the movie."
" Grace of Monaco
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,10,"'Grace of Monaco' is a biographical drama that was released in 2014 and directed by Olivier Dahan. The budget was estimated at $30 million. The scriptwriter was Arash Amel, who was also the producer of the movie. Nicole Kidman played Grace and her on-screen husband was played by Tim Roth. The composer for the soundtracks was Christopher Gunning, who has worked for many years creating content for movies and for television.This movie highlights the difficulties not only in being a part of high society and in political life, but also some misunderstandings between a married couple that could be solved with dignity and wisdom if the interlocutors have any desire to listen each other.The whole movie explains the same story, but from the perspective of different people. Therefore, I think this movie owes much to the script. The music on the one hand gives a certain charm, and on the other hand highlights a great deal of involvement in the characters' emotions, and you start to believe them.Written by Anastasiia Shystovska"
" Days of Our Royal Lives!
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,5,"It's probably not quite as bad as the reviews would have you believe. Mind you it should also be underlined that Grace of Monaco is a long way from being good. It just struck me as being much like a very glossed up, extravagant episode of a daytime soap.As the movie opens, the main thread sees big bad Monaco neighbour France talking trade blockades of its tiny, independent, but wealthy adjacent state. It did occur around this time, but the good reasons France took to choosing this option are never explored. Rather, the film depicts the episode as a David and Goliath struggle, with Nicole Kidman's Princess Grace eventually proving to be the expert with the slingshot and France's President Charles de Gaulle, her target in the unlikeliest of diplomatic battlefields..There are sub-stories involving Grace being offered the lead role in Alfred Hitchcock's Marnie and being strongly tempted to take up the offer. Another sub-story which arguably does resonate strongly because of contemporary occurrences on the international front, sees Grace being unsettled by marriage difficulties, compounded by feelings of irrelevance with her royal role and duties. May be this was the case with the former Grace Kelly, but somehow I can't see her as being the sort of person who would not bother to learn French after living in Monaco for 6 years, as the co-regent, as the movie suggests.If anyone was going to play Grace Kelly, I guess it would be Nicole Kidman and she makes a good fist of it, whilst never really sounding like Kelly. I'm not sure whether it was the script, the director, or a combination of both. But poor old Tim Roth, gets the rough end of the pineapple, playing an extraordinarily, weak, insipid, indecisive Prince Rainier, Grace's husband. The bloke did rule Monaco for 56 years. He must have had some regal qualities and abilities, but they are not forthcoming in this story. Frank Langella looks somewhat lost too as Father Francis Tucker, who appears to be a spiritual advisor to both Grace and Rainier.We get lots of shots of a sunny Monaco which is always nice and the sets and costumes look the goods. But the dramatic content is never convincing. Seriously, diplomacy via a ball room! I found it difficult to accept, as I did Grace doing an Eliza Doolittle with Derek Jacobi's Henry Higgins clone, Count Fernando D'Ailieres. It's all pretty inconsequential, even unbelievable; France declaring war on Monaco??Ultimately Grace of Monaco leaves us none the wiser as to what made this iconic figure, who must have been as complex as she was fascinating (certainly one of my personal favourite stars), tick. It's stylishly presented, but almost empty of dramatic heft."
" Nicole Kidman Could Be The Princess Of Australia.
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,6,"Grace Kelly was a fascinating character. Alfred Hitchcock was in love/obsessed with her, and you can see it in the films they made together. She becomes one of the biggest stars in the world, and then she quits to become a Princess. The world held its' breath to see how she would age and if she would, someday, return to Hollywood. And, as the world waited, she inexplicably drove her car off a cliff and died.Nicole Kidman did a great job in this role. I highly recommend watching 'Rear Window' (1954) and 'To Catch A Thief' (1955) before watching this film. Grace Kelly had a way of 'seducing the camera' - not many actresses have that ability. She wasn't overtly sexual, but I can understand why Hitchcock got all 'locked on'. Nicole Kidman can also 'seduce the camera' and she proves it in the final 30 minutes of this film.I was shocked that the film didn't address her sudden death. Instead, they left that chapter for another film and another audience. This film was about Grace Kelly adapting to royalty. The 90 minutes flew by - I could have appreciated a little more. Wonderful biopic.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

" Two hours of true beauty...
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,9,I don't understand what the outrage for the real artist is not the one that copies only but that who can bring out the reality again with his mark on.. actors and directors definetly did that and were damn good at it.
" Peace. love and beauty
",2019-08-08 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie because it is a great example how movie industry should be uplifting morales.. Simply to glorify love, peace and beauty.. No bloodshed, guns or crimes for cheap excitement.. we have enough of this in our real world, we should get peaceful resort in real examples set by great people.. Thanks to the movie makers and to great Nicole Kidman to put this great story of the great princess of Monaco"
" Grace of Monaca, she is not just a pretty girl.
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,4,"Real life, well run, well acted, shows political facet of film actress who reluctant to get carried away by the monarchy of the principality of Monaco, Alfred (Father of Thriller) is a figure in the film because she was his favorite.
Good actors, good assembly for a simple biophobia but of impact. It goes beyond the image.
She is not just a pretty girl. She was supportive and warrior supporting her husband."
" A story True enough to be worth the telling
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,7,"When the film came out, I admit I was predisposed not to like it. The casting seemed absurd (Kidman being about 20 years to old to portray grace at the requisite time for one thing). The trailers made it seem naff, as if the story was just another 'Princess Diaries' or similar. When the reviews were in, I decided I had been right to avoid it.
Tonight I watched it on TV simply because nothing else was on!
I have to report that it is a far better film than expected. High production values, and Miss Kidman's usual high quality performance (and a very soft camera focus) help. I thought Langella was also good, and Tim Roth isn't bad in a rather underwritten role. Robert Lyndsey's performance was odd but as it's a small role, not too distracting.
What saves it from Lifetime Movie of the week status is that the story of this little principalities battle with France and how it finds a place within the modern Europe with which it must live is genuinely interesting, and was unknown to me. History is almost always more interesting than fiction. And while I'm sure that some of the story may be fictionalised, the basic story here has enough 'facts' to be genuinely engaging and interesting, and pretty entertaining."
" Fine content
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,6,"For all the poor reviews it did hold my attention as shown on BBC, on a rainy Sunday."
" A Powerfully Captivating Fictional Drama
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,9,"8 September 2016. There is something humanly powerful and inspirational in this fictional account of Princess Kelly of Monaco. The tender and intense dramatic script requires Nicole Kidman to disclose the valuable possibilities of falling in love and loving a King. This fairy tale is about real life fairy tales and how they are considerably different from each other. This revealing movie is dramatic in the superficial media glow of the rich and famous and the low of real royalty life as well as its possible redemption. As dramatic in scope as the Cuban Missile Crisis was for America, the human turmoil and sacrifice offers a great message of hope and perseverance on the part of Kidman's character. This movie without the action, thriller, adventure epic plot outline, depends more on the courage and intelligence, and moral fortitude of the characterization performance which makes this movie all the more powerful and amazing in its appealing and valuable, informative presentation.Madonna in Evita (1996), Gillian Anderson in House of Mirth (2000), Natalie Portman in Black Swan (2000), Charlize Theron in North Country (2005) are some of the powerful performances that this movie brings to mind."
" Let's mess up history then, shall we?
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,2,"The bad thing about messing up history and making a movie about a real person that is not based on facts but fiction is that we tend to remember the movie. So, now thousands of people will believe that Kelly saved Monaco (de Gaulle never went to any ball, the situation was negotiated peacefully with France at the end). They will believe that the marriage with the prince did not include numerous extramarital affairs on both sides and they will believe that Grace was as tall and elegant as Nicole Kidman, the perfect princess. Too bad, because reality was good enough. The movie is beautiful, superbly esthetic, but that is all."
" Nicole Kidman best performances.
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,9,"Set amid sun-dappled Mediterranean locations, filled with fabulous frocks and elaborate production design, Grace Of Monaco is soap opera on a lavish scale."
" adore your betters, you proles
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,2,"""Grace of Monaco"" is mainly bland, polished nonsense, mixed with product placement and name dropping. It wastes your time with random drivel and wanders from one meaningless incident to another. The few ideas it does succeed in having or expressing are unkind, entitled or retrograde. For instance, the viewer is supposed to admire, nay venerate Grace for her brave determination to learn something about the language and culture of Monaco. Can you believe it : she even - gasp ! - talks with some locals !God ! If you're going to make a new and permanent home in another country, the very least you can do is learn the language. This becomes a positive duty if you're married to a member of the royal family. How are you going to represent or defend your new country, if you're unable to walk into a coffee shop and ask for one coffee, black, two lumps of sugar please ? By the same token, all members of a royal family should be familiar with social habits and traditions - it's one of the most basic requirements for the job. But no, the viewer is supposed to adore the Grace character for her pluck, bravery and self-sacrifice. Half-hidden beneath this exhortation there are some pretty nasty assumptions and prejudices. Try : ""No American should have to learn a foreign language, it's up to foreigners to learn English"". Or : ""Rich people don't have to worry about the needs and feelings of proles"". Or : ""If taxpayers throw you large chunks of money, you should not feel obliged to do something in return"". Another idea the movie is trying to sell to you : there is no need to worry about the existence of Panama-like tax havens, provided these havens yield a crop of good-looking celebrities. Still, I for one could live with the thought of the various creators of ""Grace"" living in undeserved luxury, if that meant that they would never make another movie again."
" Boring. So boring.
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,1,"This movie has sucked me into watching it twice now and, you guys, I'm mad as hell. 
The trailer leads you to believe that it will be this dramatic re-telling, albeit largely fictional, of Grace Kelly's life when all it really depicts is one or two inconvenient situations that she was faced with. 
The first time I watched it I was so disappointed and bored by the end but I decided not to review it because I am a Nicole Kidman fan. 
But then the unthinkable happened. This movie is so boring that I forgot I'd already seen it before and watched it again only to fall victim to the same torturous boredom AGAIN!
Do you see what I'm saying, it's that boring I forgot about it.
This movie is 1 hour and 43 minutes of stifling yawns and trying to stay awake all while just waiting patiently for it to get even remotely more interesting. 
What a let down."
" This Movie by any other name would still be a treat
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,8,"I agreed with the reviewer that there could have been a different title for this film (perhaps ""I am Monaco""). However in the final scene I understood why the title fit.When Hitchcock offered Grace one million dollars to play a part in a movie I thought this might have been a plot device where the sum could have gone toward paying off Monaco's debt to help show that even that would not sway the Princess from her new role or that it was such a pittance it could not address the deficit to help understand the severity of the blockade.There were sufficient intrigues without that aspect. The story and portrayals were touching making the film worthy watching. Although I appreciate the negative reviews they did not sway me from enjoying the movie."
" A Beautiful Stinker
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,2,"I really wanted to like this film, and scanned my mind for another actress who would be able to play Grace. Other than, Naomi Watts, all I came up with was Kidman. Watts and Kidman seem to do a tag team sort of thing with portrayals like this one; they seem to take turns playing fluttery ice queens with a Secret Sorrow. But Kidman never convinced me as Grace, never could seem to hold onto her accent correctly, and lacked some of the anger and spice that I hear Grace had in good measure. And may I say that it was odd to see a Miss Congeniality-style training montage in this film? The film kept doing this thing where it would switch to sweeping hyper-closeups of Kidman's face, well, parts of it, as she emoted slightly. Very irritating and I kept saying ""What are you trying to convey, Director? What?"" The script stretched credulity in almost every scene. But the final straw for me was the meandering, self-serving speech the film's Grace presented at the Red Cross Ball, a speech which we are led to believe averted a war between France and Monaco. Really? It was laughable and poorly presented and summed up the entire film for me: a beautiful disappointment that made me yearn for a glimpse of the real Grace and her charm and beauty. I just might watch Rear Window to cleanse my palate."
