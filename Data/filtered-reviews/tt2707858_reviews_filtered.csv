" Visually enticing, but falls short of being a must watch movie-even for the die hard fashion fan!
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,3,"While at times cinematically pretty and with the main character Pierre Niney at times physically enticing and appropriately charming...the overall movie is very weak. The downfalls of this production are too many to name: poor acting, unfortunate storytelling, weak directing, bad casting, considering it was made about an icon, it is unfortunate to have him eternalized in such a lackluster film."
" A love story with fashion thrown in
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,9,"I went in with low expectations and really enjoyed this film for its two central performances and as a love story. It does, in fact, follow a pretty standard biopic formula, but there's a reason formulas are popular. It makes the tumultuous events of St. Laurent's life into a story that is watchable.I think if you are expecting some kind of singular insight into St. Laurent, you're not going to find it. He was brilliant, sensitive and mentally ill, and he needed his lover/business partner Pierre Berge to anchor him. He partied way too much in the 1960s and 1970s.Certainly, there was more complexity to the story. The film glosses over the menage a trois between Berge, Victoire Doutreleau and St. Laurent lasted a lot longer and was far more fraught than in this film. Berge and St. Laurent later separating romantically but still being together is also glossed over, as is the fact that they married right before his death. Now all of that would make a really interesting and messy film, but it probably wouldn't be nearly as digestible.So, watch this for the love story, the authentic fashions, the fantastic sets (especially the Moroccan villa) and two very empathetic performances. Then, go read about the actual history."
" No redemption
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,5,"The film es bleek, no redemption, no story arch. It was so terrible being Yves? I bet there were moment of pure professional glory... but I guess being gay was what was most important thing about hike in his personality. At least that it was portrayed... his sexual life in our face... fashion and milestones 0.5%."
" I enjoyed just colorful costumes and color scheme of images.
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,3,"I didn't know Yves Saint Laurent was homosexual. Also the story forcused on that, so maybe we should call it love story better than his success one. I think it was not enough to depict his suffering."
" Indulgent fun
",2019-06-08 00:00:00,7,"The famous fashion designer is the subject of this French biographical film covering a twenty-year period beginning with the time he worked for designer Christian Dior in the late 1950s and later met his lover/business partner Pierre Berg√©.This film is as chic as the designer himself. The various styles in fashion, music and lifestyle varied greatly from the late 1950s to the late 1970s and this film emphasizes the aesthetics, charm, indulgences, scandals, and revolutionary feel, taking the viewer on a joyous ride.The same storyline was exposed in the documentary L'Amour Fou (2009) which was made shortly after Saint Laurent's death in 2008. The documentary is more complete in covering the full life story and its aftermath upon Saint Laurent's passing. The fictional film concentrates more on the difficult years of addiction and obsession in the 1970s but despite the incompleteness, it's still enjoyable mainly due to the lead performance of Pierre Niney who even looks like the designer."
" Quite a alright French biography drama!
",2019-03-19 00:00:00,7,"From out of all the biopic dramas I've seen, I gotta say this is one of the confusing ones I've seen because well, I never heard of Saint Laurent before nor it's creators who were a gay fashion designer couple. However watching the drama was quite gluing to watch and of course both the couples embraces were very uplifting as well as romantic. The actors did a good job playing the men and the backgrounds of each places they were in are quite elegant. Even the park scene was quite nice, I say people are right that France does have a romance size to it.This isn't really one of the best gay movies I have seen but it's certainly not bad to give it a watch if you feel like watching a movie! 7/10"
" A tad boring unfortunately.
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,3,His life is not necessarily biopic worthy. Not much going on. Better to watch a documentary. It's more a gay love story without depth. The cinematography is beautiful but not mindblowing.
