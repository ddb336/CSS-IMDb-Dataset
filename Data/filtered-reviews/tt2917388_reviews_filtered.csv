" Hopkins as Usual Delivers even in a B movie
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,7,"I suspect that not too much Hollywood was added to the story, so the film is not as action packed as viewers may wish. However, Hopkins as well as the rest of the cast turn in a respectable performance. A very watchable film"
" Better Than Average Kidnapping FIlm-But Flawed - Kidnapping Mr. Heineken
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,6,"Crime films can either be tragic or comic, and some of them try to be both. The masters of the comic crime films is, of course, the Coen Brothers. But when crime films try to be just violent or tragic, they tend to miss the mark. There are exceptions, of course, like The Godfather, but films like those are a once in a generation occurrence; the other 99 films of the genre are usually average unless they contain humor.
This film is practically humorless, despite a few lame attempts by veteran actor Hopkins to be pithy. His portrayal of Heineken, however, is impeccable. The other actors had an IQ of over 150; unfortunately however, that was the combined score of all five members of the incident. Poorly planned and executed; with no forethought of how and where they would go after the ransom was retrieved, this group of imbeciles thought they wouldn't be noticed missing from their normal routines once the ransom was paid. Didn't it ever occur to them that if just ONE of them was apprehended, the other four were toast as well? So, we are introduced to the five comrades early on, and are supposed to be sympathetic to them in some way. But we aren't. We consider them idiots, and for good reasons. Did this incident have any chance of success, whatsoever? Absolutely not. Simple math was against them from the start.
If you have ONE man who is a serial killer and kills one person in one incident, you have a limited set of clues to follow, and in many cases, the crime will go unsolved. But if you have FIVE people committing a crime you multiply the variables of things that can go wrong by five; and then your chances are far less likely to succeed. The plot of the film is interesting, and the inevitable conclusion is to be expected, but with a few bumps in the road. Worth viewing. PS - Showing Mr. Heineken at the start of the film as a flashback was, in my opinion, a big mistake, as it clearly gives away the inevitable ending of the film. I would be willing to bet well over 80% of the audience would not have known whether Mr. Heineken had survived or perished in real life before they watched this film."
" A great time, suspense, humor, and action.
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,10,"My wife stumbled across this on Netflix, and it
Became the date night movie. Both loved the actors and story. Plenty of humor and action and great suspense."
" Outstanding
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,7,Well told absorbing tale of a notorious kidnapping by audacious middle class culprits.
" Mundane
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,4,"This is so average in every way. I have no recollection of this event and I'm a news junkie. I can only conclude that the true events were as boring and fairly uneventful as this story, it's very unfulfilling."
" Ok
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,6,Not bad and based on true story. Some good acting but in total an average thriller.
" Serviceable crime drama
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,7,"All the elements are here but some things are not working. The actors give their all, but are a little cliched. I got the sense there was too much dialogue. The story itself is exciting enough, but I guess I've been spoiled by movies about Baader Meinhof and Gomorrah, where the leads were charismatic and the danger more pronounced, and the vision of Europe had more depth and colour. Call me crazy but I thought the lighting and the film stock used were running counter to the intrigue. It all seemed a little too high contrast indoors, and not enough contrast for the night scenes. And the film stock used seemed to lack a little definition and could have been, well, less ordinary, more big screen. There were plenty of locations, but I still got the sense that all the action was taking place in a rather dull, single suburb. Then again, maybe in reality it did. On the plus side, I did think the depiction of the early 1980s was pretty good. I also thought the use of Sir Anthony Hopkins to be a redeeming stroke of genius. Of all the actors his sparse yet crucial use was a joy to behold, and lifted the entire movie. I thought Sam Worthington good too, and to be fair he somehow outshone his immediate friend and unofficial leader of the group, being a darker character and definitely better groomed. That's what I found frustrating about the movie, little things like the lead's uncombed hair. I also don't remember the soundtrack at all, so maybe that was an opportunity that went begging. Kidnapping is an interesting ride and worth a watch, especially as it is all true, but I do believe it could have had a lot more clout."

" Bad but watchable movie.
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,5,"Shame on the casting director for casting Jim Sturgess. He is one of the flattest actors of all times. Except for 21 he has not contributed to any movie he was in. In this movie he is on one of the leading roles and his acting is so poor that you can write your mail, play candy crush while watching the movie.If it were not for Sir Anthony Hopkins, there'd be nothing to look forward in this movie."
" MONEY OR FRIENDS
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,5,"The film is based on a true story. In 1982 Amsterdam, A group of out of work construction workers, who have experienced the good life, are desperate for money. Their idea is to kidnap Freddy Heineken for ransom.The film takes about 30 minutes until the kidnapping, establishing background and minor chracter build up. At this point the film becomes a drama about kidnappers buyers' angst. The action was sparse and not spectacular. Oh, there was a car chase and some gun fire.This film opens with Freddy Heineken (Anthony Hopkins) talking, giving me Hannibal flashbacks. In fact that was all I could think about as where this film goes in the Hannibal chronology until he was off screen.This is at times a boring crime drama. Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Forgettable but not bad
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,5,"Critics were after this one. It's true that doesn't do anything great. But it manages to do almost everything ""ok"". Maybe the biggest problem is that it looks lazy, because they don't bring anything really great in any aspect. It lacks a bit of strenght on the emotion, witts on the dialogue, intelligence on the plot... etc. But is not bad"
" Don't mess with a rich man
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,7,"This movie was quite down to earth, better than I expected. Childhood friends know each other well and their emotions. A decision is made to kidnap Mr. Heineken (Anthony Hopkins). All goes well, but as the days and weeks go by waiting for the ransom and to go back to a ""normal life"" everything starts to unravel. Mr. Heineken does not seem like he has been the kidnapped. Immediately he plays upon his capture's emotions, even saying that one cannot have friendship and money at the same time. This is exactly what happens to the kidnappers, leading to their capture and ruining their friendship. Mr. Heineken had really been control all along. He makes it his personal mission to get the kidnappers, not for their actual crine but because they dared to slight him and his money and power."
