" Very Funny
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,10,"Very, very funny movie. The humour was maintained throughout the film."
" Mediocre for Simon Pegg
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,4,"Upon reading about this film I enjoyed the concept and gave it a shot.
Unfortunately there are parts in the film which stand out like a sore thumb for how poorly written they are.
The idea was great, the execution was poor."
" Very funny !
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed it a lot. If you want to relax and watching a nice comedy with bright colors and decent CGI, well it is a good choice."
" Absolutely Anything
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,2,"The good thing about Absolutely Anything. Robin Williams managed to work with one of his comedy heroes. The Monty Python team. They all provide voices.Unfortunately the film is a dog and I do not mean the one William's provide the voices to.Terry Jones directed this mess. It really is a reworking of Bruce Almighty but made actually worse.Simon Pegg plays feckless school teacher Neil Clarke. He is randomly selected by some aliens and given special powers. If he manages to use his powers to do good, the aliens will not destroy the planet.Clarke never manages to get to grips regarding the use of his special powers. He does get his neighbour Catherine (Kate Beckinsale) to fall for him. She is being pursued by her insane boyfriend, Colonel Grant (Rob Riggle) who forces Neil to abuse his powers or his pet dog dies.Absolutely Anything is unfunny at every turn and wastes its cast and potential."
" Pretty Boy Pegg is Wonderful!
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,10,"Nonsensical of course, but hilarious. Simon Pegg is a delight, as usual.I loved Dennis the dog. Give your brain a rest, and watch Absolutely Anything. You'll love it.Robin Williams voiced Dennis the dog. Some of the funniest scenes in the movie are with Dennis."
" I was watching it with the kids ..The only inproper thing is the f word
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,6,This is quite an interesting movie and I can't believe there is a last movie of Robert Williams
" A terrible movie.
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,1,"The movie has no plotline at all, it's a collection of ""funny"" ideas and scenes, it does not follow any established framework to a story and with essentially ""it was all a dream"".This movie being rated ""15"" seems like an oversight as save for two visual gags early on in the movie the whole film could've been a 12a or even a PG.I don't want to type an essay about this movie as it's not worth the time it'd take but it's basically Bruce Almighty but with none of the comedy,acting,story... anything."
" Doesn't make sense
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,3,"Potentially a good idea but when Pegg has the power he seems to be incapable of understanding what he can do or needs to do. There also needed to be some form of rule or restrictions on how he could use the power to prevent complete and utter misuse.
If you had the power why would you waste time faffing about in your mundane job and existence.If he understood he had the power to bring back his class after he had aliens destroyed them then he must have realised he could do and undo anything he wanted.More thought was needed and this could have been funnier or even more interesting without all the flaws."
" This Movie had its Minutes and the Rest was OK but Not Good
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,5,"Probably worth watching on a quarantined afternoon but any other time probaly not. Some of the dialog was really good but the not so good overshadowed it. On the whole, I think a five star rating is appropriate for me, but others might think more or less."
" This was enjoyable...
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,6,"I sat down to watch the 2015 movie ""Absolutely Anything"" in 2020. Oddly enough, I hadn't even heard about the movie prior to now, as I sat down to watch it.Initially I sat down to watch it because I hadn't seen it before, and also because I saw that the movie had Simon Pegg in the lead role. I was genuinely surprised to see that the movie also had the likes of Robin Williams and Kate Beckinsale on the cast list.I wasn't aware that this was actually the last movie that the late Robin Williams worked on, so it was a humbling experience to listen to him give the dog a voice in the movie.Now, ""Absolutely Anything"" has the heart and spirit of a classic comedy. I mean, there is just something essential about it, something that relates to the comedies of the 1980s and 1990s that I grew up watching. So it was a rather enjoyable experience to sit through ""Absolutely Anything"".I was genuinely entertained and it was a good storyline; a storyline that had a good amount of humor to it, but also was driven by the characters in the movie.If you enjoy a funny movie that has a good and entertaining storyline, then ""Absolutely Anything"" is definitely a good choice. I am rating it a six out of ten stars."
" I so wanted this to be great
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,5,"I so wanted this to be cutting edge humor.
Douglas Adams, the Pythons, Eddie Izcard the table set for breaking the mould.It starts out with plenty of gusto and promise but then slivers into the realm of predictable. If there is one thing this kind of humor needs to be void of - it's predictability. Once there the down hill slide continues. When we stop laughing we start being critical and, unfortunately, there is plenty of bad stuff to point out.The once masters and founders of the genre didn't manage to adapt to the times, didn't manage to keep it fresh. This leaves the sensation of a something that this may have been funny a long time ago.But humour is a perishable and in 2020 the humour has faded. If nostalgia is on the menu - there is a wealth of better material available."
" Everything is perfect to its own place, By pressurizes you can't make yourself happy
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,7,"A man who lead a simple life . He tries to write some exceptional novel , and goes to dream on about his thinking . Other hand he had a polite dog. Who liked to see the Tv series on about Rocket, Satellite even outside the world. But suddenly that man got a illusion of a power in him. And tried to be the happiest and most powerful person by any time.But though he got fun by applying sudden but end of the day he noticed everything was any happiness. At last of the movie he transferred his power to his dog. And his dog dismissed that power forever. Then he leaded a better life again.The short note of this movie is, You can't make happiness by your muscle power.Do your work properly you will be happy and you will enjoy your time every moment."
" Absolutely Pegg
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,6,"Simon Pegg can make as many movies like these as he wants. B movie nonsense that explores something fun. He's done a few of these already and so far I've enjoyed them all. None of them are amazing, and this is no exception, but it's definitely an enjoyable bit of background fun."
" Terrible
",2020-03-09 00:00:00,2,"A wonderfully wistful premise wasted on a movie that's a gargantuan glob of garbage. The movie is about limitless power, yet every character (especially Pegg's) consistently makes the most illogical, nonsensical decision possible, with no reasonable explanation as to why. Instead, director Jones (who displays no real directing touch) just tries to go for the easiest joke, and ironically the batting average for actual laughs is nearly nonexistent."
" 'Biscuits!! They're in the cupboard, for crying out loud.'
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,7,"A very light hearted and delightfully silly comedy with an all star cast. Neil Clarke (Simon Pegg) is an English teacher who struggles with his job and is in love with his neighbour Catherine (Kate Beckinsale). A group of five aliens (voiced splendidly by the remaining Pythons at the time!) bestow the power to do absolutely anything by random to Neil in an experiment to see if the human species can determine the difference between good and evil. What ensues is relentlessly fun and occasionally really funny! Upon watching it again, it loses some laughs on more watches strangely and feels more discombobulated in not an entirely satisfying way. Nevertheless, there are still hilarious sequences, a central romance that you invest in and a great cast bringing their all. I particularly loved Robin Williams lending his voice to Neil's dog Dennis which provided a beautiful insight into the mind of a dog! Beckinsale is enormously likeable and a treat to watch on screen and Eddie Izzard appears in a supporting role as the school headmaster and the things that Neil makes him do is really funny. It's a pretty good outing for Director Terry Jones and this turned out to be his swan song, leaving the world with a jolly spirit and plenty of giggles to look back on"
" A solid sci fi comedy
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,7,The hidden gem here is it's one of the last films Robin Williams worked on. It's really nice hearing his voice again.
" This has to be the worst movie Simon Pegg has been in
",2020-01-31 00:00:00,3,The movie is okay... Ish. I wouldn't recommend it or want to watch it again.
" Absolutely Nothing Much To It
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,6,"The Monty Python stars John Cleese,Terry Jones, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam, and Eric Idle re-unite together to provide their voices in this British science fiction comedy entitled,""Absolutely Anything"". It stars Simon Pegg, Kate Beckinsale, Sanjeev Bhaskar, Rob Riggle, Eddie Izzard and Joanna Lumley in this film about a group of mischievous aliens who provide an embittered school teacher Neil Clarke of extraordinary power in order to see how he will use them.While the viewer can see the intention of providing a good comedy,too bad that the film could be classified as boring and unfunny. Added to that,we also see that we also see a loosely knitted and episodic story of the film that could make the viewers wander while viewing it as it is far from interesting.With regards to the positive features of this film,we get to see a charming film.And of course,who could forget Robin Williams? It was his last film feature before he passed away."
" Unexpected Saturday Night Delight
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,8,"I had spent the usual 20 minutes skimming Amazon Prime - an old fashioned videoshop without the sweets at the till - for films and saw a comedy in one of its lowest categories with Simon Pegg's face on it.No idea what to expect but the rest of the main cast looked. They wouldn't sign up for crap would they? Appaently not.A little treasure of a film. Not brilliant. Not great. Just very good. Highly entertaining - some bits predictable, but aren't all films like that?Well acted. No joke overplayed. If I could do anything I would worry about the little stuff too.Hope this gets a wider audience - it deserves it."
" How did this steaming turd slip through the cracks?
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,1,"I gave this one a miss while it was in the cinema because it looked juvenile but I dismissed it as a silly, pre-teen summer comedy and thought nothing of it since.Only now have I actually sat down and watched it and...What the hell have I just watched? This has got to be one of the worst films ever made. Who on earth green-lit this project? Was it just because of the original Monty Python writer and cast's inclusion? I can think of one redeeming factor (which I will mention later) but other than literally that one thing, there is nothing even close to what could be considered a joke - let alone a narrative - in this ""comedy"".I only really gave this film a chance because of Simon Pegg who gave a pretty weak performance here, although he is lightyears away from being the worst thing about this disgrace to film.I don't even know where to start talking about this.The CGI I suppose. It is MAGNIFICENTLY bad. The aliens (played by John Cleese and company) look like something out of a failed Star Wars rip off from the early 80s. I don't have much to say about it other than that, no words can even come close to describing how putrid they look.The acting overall is very pantomime-ish, overdone and comical (in a bad way). Kate Beckinsale does nothing other than be conventionally attractive. Rob Riggle as usual is an overacted buffoon that could never be taken seriously in any professional capacity and Simon Pegg, much like the character he attempts to portray, is utterly tragic. The late Robin Williams also voices a dog, which is probably the worst role he had ever taken up thanks to the terrible writing.Speaking of writing...The script is a tone deaf, inconsistent, unintelligible disaster. It has no idea what demographic to aim for with insults written as ""frick"" or ""feck off"" only for Simon Pegg to tell his dog a few scenes later to ""Shut the f@%k up"" Which begs the question who on earth was this film made for? Fans of Monty Python? No, their awful alien counterparts are barely given screen time. Maybe for kids? No, there are several instances of profanity and inappropriate sexual innuendos. For teenagers? No, they will likely be bored by the aimless plot and uninspired writing. For adults? No, it is far too childish (in spite of the weird sexual references and inconsistent profanity) to hold their interest for more than five minutes.The film is made for no one, I can't imagine anyone enjoying this.What even happens? The main character is a down on his luck loser that is hopelessly in love with the incredibly attractive girl next door (very original). He works as a teacher and is unsurprisingly respected by no one, including his students and peers, other than his fat friend. He is then by chance given unlimited powers in which he can literally do anything at the snap of his fingers.And yet... in spite of the film's limitless premise, nothing funny, endearing or even somewhat interesting happens because the script hinders what should be an unstoppable power with endless potential. Instead it becomes nothing more than an enabler for lame gags and superficial stakes throughout the redundant plot.The only funny line in this wet fart of a film is when Rob Riggle calls Simon Pegg ""an apology of a man"" The only time the film made me exhale through my nose slightly more forcefully than normal.This film is Absolutely Garbage. How in God's name did this piece of faeces get away with an aggregated 6/10 on this website? I'll never understand. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy and it should only ever be used as a form of vile torture.Stay the hell away at ABSOLUTELY ANY-COST."
" What a waste of time and talent
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,1,"This is absolute proof that you can take a good budget, an incredible list of talented film makers and actors, a great idea and still produce a stinker of a film."
" Shocking and embarrassing
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,1,This is the absolute worst film ive ever witnessed in my life and im so sorry that i wasted time watching it. An actual 4 year old could have written this plot. Petition to cancel this movie from earth.
" Shocking and an embarrassment
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,1,Absolute worst film I've ever witnessed im my life. An actual 4 year old could have written this plot. Petition to cancel this movie.
" Completely ridiculous, and that's what makes it good...
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,6,"Typically irreverent as is common in British comedy, Simon Pegg does the genre to perfection...all while being the ignorant buffoon he loves to play. If you like stupid plots that have some saving moments, this would be it..."
" Did not reach my humor
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,5,"The story was copied from ""Bruce Almighty"".
However, I did not feel the movie really funny.
I think only kids would laugh about it.
The movie was entertaining, absolute average.Recommended for children and young adults."
" Zany British comedy
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,10,"I loved this film so much I had to watch it again. If you could imagine how a Monty Python film would look in 2015 this is it. Great story line and a superb cast. If you had stumbled on this film as I did, you begin to realise that the top comedic actors of the last 50 years are the voices for a group of crazy aliens and a dog.Simon Pegg as Neil plays the classic ordinary guy, with an ordinary life who suddenly finds he is able to make extraordinary things happen. Also a great performance by Sanjeev Bhaskar Neil's hapless friend Ray. I can't understand why the reviews haven't been better. But perhaps it takes a certain type of humour. I could recite the whole of Monty Python's Holy Grail and most of Douglas Adams Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy and if this type of nonsense does not appeal to you then you might not understand the humour in this film either."
" Absolutely awful
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,3,"This is a dreadful copy of Bruce Almighty. Despite the considerable talent involved it manages to fail at every turn with half baked ideas, poor jokes and a terrible script."
" Fun, light, comedy
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,7,"This was a fun movie, in the same vein as Bruce Almighty."
" I was so excited when I saw the cast
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,5,"I had never heard of this movie but when I came across it on Amazon I knew I had to watch it. Monty Python, Robin Williams, Simon Pegg, Kate Beckinsale, Eddie Izzard, Rob Riggle. All stars!!!!! However this movie is very forgettable and disappointing if only because of the star power and potential it had."
" Absolutely annoying...
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,4,"I thought this film could have been amazing.. but it was horrendously annoying. The lead does all the wrong things throughout, making it an obvious goofy fail movie. I wanted to see something much more full than this.. it lacks a lot.Or maybe I'm just having a bad day..."
" Incredibly dull and unimaginative, wasted potential
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,3,"Given the god like powers given to the main character, he is amazingly, stupidly unimaginative. The script wasted the concepts in inane and unfunny uses of the power. You'll be very frustrated watching this. Skip it."
" Good movie but disappointed with words
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,8,It was perfect to watch this with our 12 year old but were disgusted at the F reference half way through. It just didn't need it and could have been referenced another way.
" Absolutely Anything by Terry Jones
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,5,"One of the most interesting questions to explore is, if someone has the powers to be able to do anything what would the person do. This question can be explored through some stories, which can be explored either in the funniest way or in a dramatic way. Some funny stories would explore this question through workable humor, by seeing how the main characters who get these powers, try to be as responsible as possible. Some dramatic stories would explore this question through deep emotions, on how the main characters slowly become less doubtful, by using these powers in the course of the story. Other stories can even use both elements, by balancing the humor and the drama to be workable from the beginning to the end. The comedian filmmaker Terry Jones seems interested, to explore this interesting question, by elaborating a story filled with humor. As it would bring the other members of Monty Python together again, besides casting actors like Simon Pegg and Kate Beckinsale. As well as Robin Williams which with this story, becomes his last movie to act. In 2015 came out Absolutely Anything by Terry Jones with Simon Pegg, Kate Beckinsale, the Monty Python Team and Robin Williams. The movie's plot: A group of aliens (the Monty Python Team) decide as an experiment to randomly choose the teacher Neil Clarke (Simon Pegg), by giving him the powers to be able to do anything. Once Neil realizes he has these incredible powers, he would try use them cautiously. Including by trying to find a way to conquer Catherine (Kate Beckinsale), or the woman he is in love with. As well as turning Neil's dog Denise (Robin Williams), into a talking rational thinking creature. The movie seems to be intriguing by using funny humor, as there were expectations the story would be convincing for the audience. The humor works well for some scenes to be hilarious, through every single angle shots and the editing. As well as thanks to the funny monologues and dialogues, to be workable in the funniest moments. But the humor of the story is not enough to make a convincing movie, which does not give any reflections about the meaning by having the powers to be able to do anything. Simon Pegg did a well done performance as Neil Clarke, a teacher who gets these extraordinary powers. But without have any idea how to use them, even Neil tries to be as responsible as possible, by having most of the time not any good results. Kate Beckinsale made an acceptable performance as Catherine, who then falls in love with Neil. But once Catherine finds out Neil has these powers, things would get a little bit complicated. The Monty Python Team did good performances as the group of aliens, who analyze in the goofiest way if the experiment is moving forward with either good or bad results. Robin Williams was hilarious as Denise, a talking rational thinking dog who loves Neil, but his big mouth would get Neil in trouble. In the movie there are some funny scenes, as each of the cast do well done performance. But still does not get any answers about the meaning, of having powers to be able to do anything. Absolutely Anything is an entertaining movie with workable humor, but without giving any answers to be explored, as the premise of the story was supposed to."
" Absolutely Saw That Coming
",2019-06-04 00:00:00,7,"Let me first say this: I'm a HUGE Simon Pegg fan, as well as British humor, I LOVED the fact that this popped up on Netflix, and I'd forgotten all about this movie! I'd not seen it yet, and this being Robin Williams last movie, released posthumously a year after his death, just made it that much more precious to watch!There's no zombies, and there's no Djinn, but boy do we have some interesting aliens! Simon's character is riding his bike when he gets struck by a van! At that moment, in a very Vogon-esque a la Hitchhikers Guide To the Galaxy, there's a ship with I believe I counted 5 aliens above the earth, trying to decide if they should just destroy our planet too make way, OR, as some of our new friends are sporting chaps, they want to know if Earthlings are a race worth saving. So, they decide to bestow ABSOLUTE POWER upon a man randomly chosen, to see what he would do with said power! Now these aliens are a panel of SUPPOSEDLY SUPREME BEINGS, and I can't keep from thinking the one- who's so evil - looks like a prawn, another- who's more benevolent - has a beak like a tropical bird, they all resemble SOMETHING on earth Lol ! So, just as his crash occurs, our hero has this power bestowed upon him.Like ANY TYPICAL super power movie, you have the shock of finding out you have the power, then there's the complication with the girl, and the ultimate MORAL question, ""If you CAN use your power to make her love you, and she'll NEVER KNOW, SHOULD YOU?"" Then there's the typical bumbling awkwardness, which embarrasses him, and keeps him so many times from asking the girl out etc.This Movie is a reviewer's dream of cliche Super Power movies! The ONLY saving grace of this movie that keeps it out of the circular file? Simon Pegg & Robin Williams! Those 2 are electric! Lol! So, sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride!!!"
" Creative and Funny
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,9,"I don't usually find myself laughing out loud, but I certainly did during this movie. Based on other reviews, guess this is just my kind of movie with silly Monty Pythonesqueness."
" A family-friendly film...with one scene with a lot of swearing!
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,5,"This film would have been a 4/10 had it not been saved by Robin Williams as Dennis the Dog. I loved the premise of the film, however was let down by the performances of Kate Beckinsale, who played a really dull television producer, and Rob Riggle who is, frankly, annoying. However there were some very funny scenes, with Simon Pegg and Sanjeev Bhaskar, particularly when Ray is turned into a sausage. I think the film didn't fully understand who its audience were as there were some very childish humour combined with some very explicit sexual references!Afterthought: R.I.P. Robin Williams, we all miss you!"
" English humour isn't for everyone.
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,8,"I'm just glad to see that much talent in one movie.
It had a slightly hamfisted feel that reminded me of ""Click"" but all five Pythons?!
Gotta love it."
" Love this movie
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,10,Hanging out with friends and telling them how much I love this movie!! So good 😂
" An okay film
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,5,Has its moments but i feel like the budget and a couple of other things held if back from its potential.
" Entertaining Comedy with Robin Williams's Last Voice-Over Appearance
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,7,"14 November 2017. In the same vein as its previous incarnations, Bruce Almighty (2003) with Jim Carrey and Oh, God! (1977) with John Denver, Simon Pegg gets his chance at absolute power, but with the help this time of extraterrestrial superior beings in this romantic comedy. There are some really funny moments in this comedy yet the poignant, emotive bite doesn't quite as sting as much as possible. Robin Williams appears in voice over as the dog, in his very last movie to be released with his passing in 2014. Kate Beckinsale remains in great form from her Serendipity (2001) days while becoming the face of the Underworld franchise. Overall, this movie is an enjoyable entertaining experience without the deeper, richer moments that it was capable of."
" Great actors, good potential, both wasted
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,6,"There was a lot of good potential in this movie-WHAT IF YOU SUDDENLY HAD THE POWER TO DO ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING? There were great actors who CAN act, but just decided to phone it in on this movie. What could have been a 'memorable classic', turned out to be just a 'fun movie'."
" A lackluster revisit to ""The Man Who Could Work Miracles""
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,5,"I was surprised that across a dozen reviews I did not find a single mention of the 1936 film of the H. G. Wells story starring Roland Young. Absolutely Anything is amusing. There are some good laughs. However, it has all the flaws outlined in detailed by other reviewers (no chemistry between leads, mostly set in an apartment, lots of overlooked potential, etc).I was immediately struck by the similarity in premise to the far better The Man Who Could Work Miracles. It's dated, of course, and the effects are of the period, but the story is both more ambitious and funnier where it attempts comedy.If you just love Simon Pegg, which I do, by all means see this, for completeness I suppose. (What's really, truly shocking is how completely unfunny the segments with the Python alumnae are, with the possible exception of the wonderful resolution that comes from Dennis, the dog, and that's not funny because of the Python people, but because of the just desserts served up. Nod's as good as a wink. I can say no more.)After you see Anything, go directly to watch The Man Who Could Work Miracles and enjoy Roland Young's mousey character as he gives in to temptation, as a human being really might."
" Not bad... Not bad at all!
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,8,"Its a simple funny movie with a bit of moral tied to it. Acting wasnt that bad at all & ya it may not be a big all star movie, but I enjoyed it. Quite a few funny parts to be honest & well some deserving parts as well. I have nothing bad to say about the movie, but I must say its not for everyone."
" sweet and innocent, in a slightly naughty way
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,10,"I love fantasy. And for those like me, this is a solid pick.This feels like a very British film. And so I can see why the original Monty Python cast came in. And it has mildly dark bits by Robin Williams, which is his best talent, he has a dark and free sense of humor.Our hero grows, as he learns how to deal with his truly awesome powers. There is a bit of the gift that needs careful handling here, and he must practice. And a lot of learning to love and trust himself, since he has been having a rough time of life lately.Watching him go through upbeat changes is lovely. And seeing him do so many very silly things is too. It takes a light heart to see this. If you're in the midst of a heavy day, wait until you're not. If you're feeling like a big kid, then this is a great choice."
" Enjoyable
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,7,"If you want casual, easy fun, this is the movie for you. Silly, illogical, crazy and entertaining."
" Couldn't Maintain the Humor
",2018-10-09 00:00:00,4,"""Neil"" (Simon Pegg) is an ordinary teacher who has a crush on a woman named ""Catherine"" (Kate Beckinsale) who lives one floor beneath him in the same apartment complex. Then one day a group of aliens discover that the earth is inhabited and subsequently decide to give one particular person--in this case Neil--unlimited powers in order to see whether humans are worthy of surviving as a species or not. Needless to say, this creates all kinds of trouble for Neil and everybody who has any kind of relationship with him. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film started off rather well but couldn't quite keep the same level of humor throughout due in large part to the cartoonish nature of some of the scenes. Fortunately, Kate Beckinsale managed to provide some measure of solidity otherwise this film would have been much worse. That being said I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average."
" A diverting time passer...from which I guess I expected too much.
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,6,"When I first read about ""Absolutely Anything"" on IMDB, I was excited to see it. After all, it was directed by the late Terry Jones....and I adore almost all the post-Monty Python stuff he's done. His documentaries have been brilliant and I longed to see him direct yet again...plus he co-wrote the film. And, I was excited to see that five of the old Python actors were in the film. Ultimately, however, this all led to disappointment as most of the Pythoners were NOT physically in the film but just provided voices for some goofy aliens. And, while there is a quick cameo of Jones himself...it was just too quick. Plus, and I know this will sound awful, Jones turned out to be in horrible health when he made the film and he was suffering from rather severe Dementia. I have no idea how much this affected the movie...but surely it did.The story itself is a silly thing where Neil (Simon Pegg) is suddenly given god-like powers in order for these aliens to test the human race. And, if he does poorly and acts selfishly, then the entire planet is slated for destruction. Naturally, Neil is dumb and does lots of dumb things with the powers but ultimately makes a great decision at the end.In many ways, the film is like combining the old ""Twilight Zone"" episode ""Mr. Dingle the Strong"" (where Burgess Meredith is given Herculean physical power) and ""Evan Almighty"". The film IS enjoyable and it kept my interest...unfortunately, it also was nothing more than this and the Python reunion (of sorts...and without the deceased Graham Chapman) was a bust. Watchable and worth seeing...provided your expectations are not huge.
By the way, in a weird case of art NOT imitating life, there is one point where Neil's dog (voiced by Robin Williams) saves someone from committing suicide. Considering Williams himself committed suicide and the film came out well after this, it seem in questionable taste to have this scene."
" CAN I HAVE IT IN WHITE
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,7,"Neil (Simon Pegg) is a teacher who dreams about his neighbor (Kate Beckinsale) and loves his dog (Robin Williams). When the film combines STAR TREK 1 and BRUCE ALMIGHTY, aliens give Neil absolute power as a test for the survival of all of mankind.The film has potential and it had its moments. The absolute powers follow precise speech with no regard to consequences. I kept waiting for the film to get better and have the big laugh. It didn't happen. The high point was using the cast of Monty Python as the voices for aliens.Guide: A couple of F-bombs. Brief nude female torso"
" ""Bruce Almighty"" meets ""Bedazzled"" Absolutely hilarious
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,8,"Anyone who rated this less than a 5 has no sense of humor. I don't know what the heck they were expecting to see but whatever it was it was not ab out this funny flick.Simon Pegg, a British staple in comedic endeavors, is perfectly cast as the poor shlub who is given the power to have anything he wishes just by saying it and waving his hand. The kicker is that he only has the power for 24 hours and that his wishes don't go exactly as planned.The maxim, ""Be careful what you wish for,"" could be the theme of this funny flick - especially if you are used to speaking literally. The power is granted to Pegg by a bunch of the weirdest assortment of aliens this side of the Bar Scene in Star Wars who travel from galaxy to galaxy looking for species worthy of joining their fraternity of planets.I liked this film so much that I watched it a second time with my daughter. You'll love it."
" Absolutely anything - so stupid jokes, if can't better
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,5,"Indeed, the worst part of this is script. It seems just as a sloppy work. Could not fill 80 minutes (real duration) with decent jokes, good dialogs and sense. There were some funny moments here and there, but most of it seems forced, uninspired.
Supposed to be some romance, love story, but only real love here was love between Neil and his dog. Too bad, because basic idea has great potential. 
Then, all those ideas what to change - writer just went in direction to make something funny, shocking. often lacking elementary logic. Probably best example was with unlimited food. 1 minute after Neil said it and waved, on TV was talk about very big average weight of people in China. Seriously ? The wishes have backward effect ? Then why he did not go in changing history ? Or, best question: why did not change self ?Only real good joke/point was with dog at the end.Acting: was overall fine, considering material. And I need to say, that I can imagine that some more famous actors/actresses refused to participate in this. There was too much F-word without real need. Most of characters acted on really low level considering language, social behavior, etc. Surely, comedy is not to be realistic, but there must be some level of it. Grant was completely over top with stupidity.And yet another movie where annihilation of humankind from some superior intelligence was considered. I find it very disappointing, that screenwriters take it rather than some theme about how to make self better. Maybe they failed in it, and take all others as such ? Ratings of main involved:
Simon Pegg: 7
Kate Beckinsale: 6 - she pulled out what could from poor script
Terry Jones as director: 6
Terry Jones and Gavin Scott as writers: 0 - hey, I can give here rating 0 ! Hurra me !

" And Now for Something Completely Different
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,"This film deserved a better fate than the one it got--a quick release before disappearing into the void. The film isn't perfect by far but Simon Pegg makes a funny lead character, Kate Beckingsale is breathtakingly beautiful throughout and the Monty Python gang has a nice turn as well.But the real surprise for me was Robin Williams. I have NOT been a fan and he's caused me more pain than laughs throughout his career. But in this, his final role, Williams is absolutely FABULOUS. He's funny and gives Dennis character a lot of heart. What a great way to go out.A few reviewers have noted this is a ""family friendly"" comedy. But be aware there's a lot of unnecessary swearing that I found...well, unnecessary. But Jones delivers a script with more hits than misses and as a director keeps things rolling.This is one that is well worth giving a try."
" Stupid fun
",2018-04-03 00:00:00,6,"Maybe sometimes you do need to throw subtlety out of the window and just make an honest and unpretentiously dumb movie. You, creators of Absolutely Anything, make an excellent point with your movie there. As I watched it, I often found myself thinking ""This is so silly,"" but then wondering ""is that a problem?"" As far as stories for romantic comedies go, this one must have been fished out of the very bottom of the barrel. It exists only as a base for the movie's situational comedy. Half the humour comes from jokes centred around the magic wishes of Simon Pegg's character getting taken too literally. How original... The rest of the humour comes from the level of ridiculousness of the effects of each wish. The humour is therefore not high brow, but the movie is nonetheless funny, with a lot of good timing. Absolutely Anything feels less like a movie and more like a comedy sketch that has been stretched to movie length and given a budget. That budget is not giant, judging from the level of CGI effects, but big enough to get top billing actors. Simon Pegg does his Simon Pegg shtick with relative ease. Kate Beckinsale is ok, though she doesn't do much beyond providing a pretty female co-lead, who somehow looks 28 at the age of 44...must have been one of the wishes. Both leads are a bit bland. The most interesting additions to the film are Rob Riggle and Sanjeev Bhaskar. They are not funny, but their performances add colour to the movie. Robin Williams plays only a minor role, but considering that this was his last movie, there is extra value there. He isn't given anything particularly funny to say though and does not appear to have been given room to do improvisation. This movie is harmless. It is a little bland and forgettable, but it is stupid fun."
" If you just want a funny movie, this is it.
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,8,"People who hate this movie, admit it. The scene where he ""solves"" all the problems of the world and we find out without global warming the planet freezes is the reason you hate this movie...If you expect everything to be dark, miserable and filled with horrid people screwing each other over then this isn't the movie for you. It's a fun movie with screwy antics and yes a bit of juvenile humor. Not everything has to be some dark reflection on the human condition. Sometimes a movie can just be fun with out some kind of serious moral or strong political message. Get over yourselves folks. Try smiling, laughing and enjoying life without all the darkness. This was simply a fun movie. Don't try to make it into something more than it was."
" Seriously funny
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,10,"If you need a good laugh watch this movie! Everybody in this movie was so funny. The main character is pathetic at first but you learn to laugh at him and like him. The characters in this movie were so funny, great job on the script. If you are a serious person you probably won't like it as it is just for laughs and nothing serious. I loved this movie but I like to laugh."
" Fun, Funny and Fantastically enjoyable.
",2017-10-12 00:00:00,9,"Absolutely Anything isn't the kind of film that would win awards, nor will it come in on the top 100 films of all time, but that's not its goal; it is a fun film with a lot of acting talent including Robin Williams in his final role before his untimely death and the members of Monty Python in voice over roles. Simon Pegg is a likable guy surviving on a teachers salary as he tries to write a novel and trying to woo the girl of his dreams, and failing miserably but then fate... or in this case aliens throws him a hand.This movie was made to be just a bit of fun, it's not trying to rewrite the art of film making and it also doesn't rely on the over top, gross out humour that we've become accustomed to lately. I found each joke landed well, and gave full belly laughs many times throughout the film. It wasn't offensive or rude and was rife with British humour. Absolutely Anything deserves so much higher ratings, it is a fun way to spend 1.25 hours."
" Amusing, but not really funny.
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,5,"'ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A British sci-fi comedy which reunites all of the living Monty Python members, for the first time since 1983's 'MONTY PYTHON'S THE MEANING OF LIFE'. It was directed by Monty Python actor Terry Jones (who's also directed or co-directed the other Monty Python movies) and it was written by Jones and Gavin Scott. The film stars Simon Pegg, as an average human guy that's chosen at random, by a galactic council of aliens, to be given the powers to do absolutely anything he wants. The powers given are a test, by the aliens, to decide whether or not Earth should be destroyed, or if it's inhabitants should be allowed into the galactic council or not. The film is also notable for being Robin Williams' last film role (as the voice of a dog). The movie also costars Kate Beckinsale, Sanjeev Bhaskar, Rob Riggle, Eddie Izzard, and the additional voices of Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, John Cleese and Eric Idle (the Monty Python cast). It's received mostly negative reviews from critics, and it only received a very limited indie theatrical run in theaters. I found it to be pretty poorly executed, which is a shame considering all of the talent involved. A group of four aliens, which call themselves the 'galactic council', find a space probe containing information about Earth (and the human race). They use this information to debate whether they should destroy Earth, or allow humans into their elite council. According to the council's rules they must choose an earthling at random, who will be given powers to do whatever they want (as a test), and if they use the powers for good than humanity will be saved. They randomly choose a lonely secondary school teacher, named Neil Clarke (Pegg), for their test. He of course knows nothing about how to deal with his sudden gift, and he puts the entire planet in jeopardy. The movie is amusing, but it's not really funny. It tries to be somewhat emotional, and insightful at times, but it fails at these elements as well. Pegg gives it his all though, in the lead, but the material just doesn't work at all. It's a good concept for a silly sci-fi comedy, but it's just a little too silly and not thought through enough (in my opinion).Watch an episode of our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at:https://vimeo.com/236806254"
" Not terrible...but not great
",2017-10-04 00:00:00,5,"This movie did a lot of things right, but also failed on many levels. Kate Beckinsale is a wonderful actor and is usually a great leading lady. Unfortunately, her work in this movie came off as forced and generic. Simon Pegg delivers as best he can without Nick Frost. I felt like the movie overall was an ""R"" rated Bruce Almighty but instead of God, we got Scientology. Not a bad watch but you really do not want to watch it expecting Shuan of the Dead or Hot Fuzz."
" Corny and childish, but some good laughs
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,5,"This movie started out completely stupid and continued that way until the story-line and situations became a situational comedy with a ""what would you do"" and a ""what would actually happen"" scenario.If you can get past the childish premise and basis and the ""bizarre crew of extraterrestrials"" as the movie is billed, there are really some ""laugh out loud"" moments if you are the type of person who can loosen up enough to enjoy them.British movies are usually not my thing, so that could pay a role in my not being totally impressed by this. British movies to this American are usually so stupid its embarrassing to watch, or so complex and dialogous I fall asleep trying to pay attention."
" Good idea badly executed
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,2,"Simon Pegg plays the same character in all of his films; it was funny in Shaun of the Dead but it grew tired quickly and bizarrely he still does it. Needless to say Simon Pegg's ""everyman"" character is every bit as annoying as it was the last dozen or so times he played it. I found myself transfixed more on his hair transplant than his lines.The talking dog played by Robin Williams could have been done so much better. The lines the dog was given were like a cross between Dr Dolittle and What Women Want: ""what if a dog could talk?! Oh I bet it would say how much it likes biscuits and wants to hump your leg!"" Predictable bilge.The ""chemistry"" between Kate Beckinsale and Simon Pegg was strained and unbelievable. There is no way that she would like or even consider Pegg's charisma-less neighbour. We also never find out why Rob Riggle's character liked her so much or the details of how they met. Speaking of Rob Riggle, I expected more from him really.Eddie Izzard was completely bland in this. He can't act, he's not funny and he should stick to walking around in lipstick and his pink beret preaching the virtues of a ""fair and equal society"" while enjoying his millions like the rest of his celebrity peers.The aliens were completely unnecessary and the ""Monty Python"" ""team"" playing them were humourless too. ""Monty Python"" was and never will contain an ounce of humour: just tired jokes and idiotic quirkiness.The only saving grace of the film is the exploration of questions like what would happen if everyone had enough food that they wanted and a home they wanted. However, despite knowing the film was a ""comedy"", I found myself nitpicking for plot holes. I lost count of the number of times Pegg's dull character could've wished to improve things. On one occasion, his friend begged him to stop some woman literally worshipping him, which he could've done in a second but of course he was too busy so we were treated to more of this stretched out, unimaginative ""joke"".The ending was also nonsensical. Why would the aliens give anyone enough power to destroy them? Very disappointing."
" Very funny
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,8,"It's not too big on the story, but it a great movie that doesn't take itself too serious. There was many moments that made me laugh out loud, something that's usually pretty hard to do, but I'm more on the British humour side than the American side.It's similar to Bruce Almighty in many ways, but I thought this one was way better. Jim Carey can be funny, but only in small doses. This movie keeps it lightly."
" Absolutely...Disappoining
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,5,"""Absolutely Anything"" is a comedy starring Simon Peg as Neil, a very under-whelmed school teacher. Neil is just an average Joe. There's nothing special about him. He lives in a hum-drum world, surrounded by average people, and works at a job he absolutely despises. Sounds like most of the people I know...Unbeknownst to him, he is given a special power by some all-knowing, supreme aliens to do ANYTHING. Little does he know that how he uses this power will determine whether the earth survives as one of the planets. The aliens (wonderfully voiced by former Monty Python alums) observe his every move and, well, are not impressed.I was not very impressed with this movie either. It had a huge amount of talent: Simon Peg, the gorgeous Kate Beckinsale (it was nice to see her smile for a change), Rob Riggle, Eddie Izzard, and the voice- over talents of John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, and the late Robin Williams. However, unlike other critics, I was not impressed by Williams' performance at all. To me, it just seemed very scripted and sedate. Also, with this many comedic actors in lead roles, there should have been so many more laughs. The message of ""with absolute power comes absolute responsibility"" was negated with sophomoric penis jokes and an ending that was just, well, ridiculous.Rated ""R"" for brief nudity, language, and sexual situations. ""Absolutely Anything"" was ultimately absolutely disappointing."
" A Fantastical Comedy with Heart and Originality
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,9,"Critics have said that Terry Jones' latest film is a disappointment, considering this is likely his last film. I would say the real disappointment is that with the sun setting on Terry Jones' career, the critics of our day are still as bloodthirsty, ruthless, and petty as they have always been and that he has to suffer for it. If you aren't aware, his mental condition is such that Jones no longer has the capacity for speech/communication; it's like a variation of Parkinson's - he is still in good physical health otherwise (John Cleese and Eric Idle have only recently made this public on their most recent tour together). Now I'm not saying that because of Jones' condition that they should take it easy on him; I'm saying that they've always been hypercritical and they fact that they are taking it out on a sick old man is just extra vile. Add to that what may now truly be Robin Williams' swan(dog) song and the last reunion of the 5 living Pythons on screen and we have ourselves a travesty - this film never had a chance to be welcomed as all the talents involved deserved. It's not the most unique premise, to be certain - summing it up easiest would be ""a secular Bruce Almighty"". Jokes and gags are clever, cheeky, and kept me chuckling throughout. Honestly, I don't know how anyone could not laugh when Simon Pegg's wishes are hilariously misinterpreted. Seriously, did I mention Simon Pegg is in this? If you are a fan, that should be enough to pique your interest and it's quite an entertaining hour and 25 minute jaunt."
" cliché predictable juvenile propaganda

" Pegg and the Pythons
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,7,"It's hard not to like 'Absolutely Anything' – Simon Pegg, best known for his role as 'Shaun' in 'Shaun of the Dead, Spaced' and almost every other film where he's played a slight variation of his usual lovable slacker alter-ego – plays, well, her a variation of his usual lovable slacker alter-ego. However, when he's wandering around in London one day pining over his neighbour, Kate Beckinsale, he's given the power to have anything and everything he wants by the cast of Monty Python (albeit computer-generated alien monstrous versions of themselves who live in a space ship and decide to test humanity in this way to see what happens – and whether to blow the entire planet up while they're at it!). All Pegg has to do is wave his hand and his innermost desires come to fruition.He therefore fixes the entire world's problems and everyone lives happily ever after.Okay, so that would make a pretty dull film. Everything goes about as swimmingly as you'd expect given a man who talks to his dog unlimited superpowers. You'll notice I opened this review with the line 'it's hard not to LIKE Absolutely Anything.' I didn't use the word 'LOVE.' And the reason being that this is basically one of those films that you can have on in the background and do other things and not really miss that much.It's definitely not bad. It's just not a 'classic' comedy. Yes, the appearance of the (remaining) Monty Python boys is always welcome. Even their beautifully-weird alien incarnations are as madcap as their geriatric human selves. And it's great to see them all together on screen again. In some ways... the film could just be about them and would be even better! Pegg plays Pegg. Kate Beckinsale plays 'generic love interest #56' and there's an array of characters who you'll sort of recognise from other things, but not really know where. The only real stand-out character (besides the CGI pythons) is the dog. The reason being because one of Pegg's wishes is that his pet can talk. And talk her does. For he's voiced by none other than the (sadly) late, great Robin Williams and, yes, he's definitely on a par with the Pythons when it comes to enjoyable screen time.If you're looking for a fun little comedy to pass the time then this would fit the bill. It's a nice enough film which doesn't really try to be anything too amazing and should appeal to pretty much everyone. Once you know the premise then you'll probably predict every last plot point that's to come. However, I certainly couldn't bring myself to hate it and will definitely re-watch it again in a couple of years."
" Funny British version of ""Bruce Almighty""
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,7,"Simon Pegg, Robin Williams, John Cleese and the Monty Python gang are just some of the comedic talent in this movie. Now admittedly yes it is essentially a British remake of ""Bruce Almighty"" (which I absolutely love) and while it's not hilarious it is certainly very funny. So the plot in it's simplest form is Pegg's character is given the ability to do absolutely anything he wants by aliens looking to accept Earth into their alliance or destroy it and what follows are some rather funny outcomes. Now I am a fan of Simon Pegg partly because I was born in the same city as the actor and I genuinely find him very funny (""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Paul"" are two of my favourite comedy movies) and there's no question I adored Robin Williams so those two names drew me to want to see this movie and I was laughing at practically every joke in the movie. Now in truth the story could've been better but for what it's worth it isn't terrible. My only gripe with it is it should've been a ""15"" certificate due to the number of times the f-word is actually used in it and the brief nudity in one sequence (to put into perspective it was rated a 12A here in the UK which allows mild swearing, maybe one use of the f-word and implied nudity not in your face ""those are definitely breasts"" nudity) which certainly surprised the adults who had brought their young kids to see a movie with Robin Williams as a talking dog let me tell you. The movie is good, it is funny, is it the greatest comedy ever made? I'd have to say no, but it's a good movie for a chuckle and especially if you're a fan of any of the actors in the movie...just don't let your children watch it if you don't like them hearing the f-word or seeing naked breasts in a movie rated ""12A"" (or ""PG-13"" or the equivalent certificate if you're watching in another country)."
" Absolute Power
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,6,"Empowered with the ability to do absolutely anything by a group of aliens testing whether humankind is inherently good or evil, a milquetoast British schoolteacher struggles to decide what to do in this comedy co-written and directed by Monty Python alumnus Terry Jones. The gags are very much hit or miss, but there are far more hits than misses as the film frequently derives humour from the overly literal nature of his powers, finding himself in a dog bowl when wishing himself back home having dinner with his dog and so forth. The dog -- voiced by Robin Williams after being wished the ability to talk -- is the biggest highlight of the film with a particularly funny scene in which he is mistaken for a gay lover. Amusing as the film often is, the plot frequently feels very contrived with the aliens only ever existing as an excuse for the protagonist's inexplicable powers - and the film's constant cutting back to the aliens musing over their experiment is an unwelcome distraction, novel as it is to have the aliens voiced by the five still living members of the Monty Python troupe. The film also spends far too much time on side plots involving a beautiful yet lonely neighbour (played by Kate Beckinsale) and her possessive ex-boyfriend (Rob Riggle). That said, Riggle has some very funny moments as he spies on Beckinsale in an often slapstick manner, with his condescending attitude towards Brits bringing to mind Kevin Kline in 'A Fish Called Wanda'. All in all, 'Absolutely Anything' is not bad for what it is, but Jones has clearly not aimed too high either."
