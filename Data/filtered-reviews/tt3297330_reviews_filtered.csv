" Good Kill = Good Movie!
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,10,"I'm glad ""Good Kill"" is getting good reviews because it's a GOOD movie! Watch it tonight, you won't be disappointed!"
" Boring
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,4,"This type of movie is just frustrating. The acting is forced, there's no chemistry, and the whole story is whiny. A Farce."
" Garbage
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,1,"Blind patriotism may be the mark of a fool but films like this are endemic of something I find far more sinister. I was a combat medic and served / deployed during OIF. For all the difficulty I have experienced both during and after my time in the Army, I remain defiantly proud. I couldn't have asked for better men to serve alongside. America is very lucky to be protected by men and women who not only have guts but also some of the biggest hearts I have ever seen.
I would never say bad apples can't be found in that barrel nor can I always attest to the wisdom of our civilian leadership. But America will always be a great country because we have the moral courage to question decisions we have made. Sometimes we fall short, but the resolve to do better is always a priority. Oliver Stone's Platoon for example is an excellent film about soldiers at war. It's greatness lies not just in its brilliance as a work of film, but also as an opportunity for Americans to look at themselves in the mirror. We need films like Platoon just like we need spell check on Microsoft Word. It is highly critical of the military and our involvement in Vietnam. It's brutal, uncompromising, and heart breaking. Stone holds up the mirror and we can decide whether we like what we see. That's the hallmark of an honest anti war film. But just like we need Platoon there is nothing wrong about films that serve as testaments to the bravery and fidelity of our fighting men. Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down are fine examples.
Good Kill doesn't fit anywhere in this equation. It's not an anti war film, it's a hit piece. It's a film with a palpable hatred for America, the armed forces, and the men and women who serve. They couldn't even be bothered with seeking out technical advice. A film that doesn't understand its own subject matter is already in big trouble. How am I supposed to take it seriously if there is zero authenticity to it? The technical gaffs could fill an encyclopedia. Good Kill's greatest sin however its unapologetic lazy. This could have been a better film with a different script and director. There is material in this subject that could potentially raise very interesting questions. Good Kill can't be bothered with anything that approaches objective thought. It repeatedly rams the ""message"" down our throats and then kicks us in the ass for good measure. It typifies the fundamental stupidity of the hate America crowd. They don't want to be challenged and can't handle ambiguity. They have a hawk's eye for human weakness but no stomach for it.
The idea of a drone pilot arguing with a CIA officer over an intended target is just ludicrous. Good Kill promulgates the theory that our military will gladly waste billions of dollars worth of missiles for the soul purpose of hunting down innocent civilians as if it were sport. This may exist in some Leftist's wet dream but here in reality its simply laughable.
The fact of the matter is that I am alive today and have a beautiful family. On multiple occasions I, and many others, would be dead had there not been a drone pilot watching our back. They saved a lot of lives but the type of crowd that enjoys this type of rubbish probably sees that as a bad thing."
" You can't handle the truth.
",2019-07-31 00:00:00,9,"US Patriots will hate this.
An insight into the CIA led American war machine that sadly the UK are party to.
Ethan Hawke plays a veteran pilot battling his morals more than al Qaeda or the Taliban.
Set in Las Vegas 1000s miles from any warzone... ask yourself would you do this?
My neighbours 5 year old girl is currently frolicking happily but noisily in the garden mid summer. Should I get my gun?"
" Great acting can't save a stupid script
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,6,"Glimpses of brilliance, but ultimately oddly structured, misplaced home drama, improbable actions by far too many, over-played evil spooks, egregious errors*, and just generally not right. A miss. A big miss. Surprised it was released it was such a mess.*Air force does not fly off carriers. Seriously, at all."
" Solid drama on the ethics of drone warfare
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,7,"Having written my summary there is not that much more to add without spoilers. The camera work is good, the relationships are well written and acted and the plot is solid if unsurprising. It's a professional production and worth a look, important for its day and as realism for our times."
" A LOT OF LOVE WENT INTO THAT HATE
",2018-09-27 00:00:00,6,"The film centers on Tom Egan (Ethan Hawke) a former Air Force pilot who now works in Nevada killing terrorists with drones. He is part of a crew of four and a commander (Bruce Greenwood). When the CIA takes over selecting targets, collateral damage is not an issue. This provides a conscience problem for Tom and one of his co-workers (ZoÃ« Kravitz). Two of his co-workers have no problems performing their duties providing a debate on the morality and sanity of what we are doing.At home Tom would rather make love to a bottle of vodka than his wife Molly (January Jones) a hot blonde and former Vegas dancer. He prefers to drink and brood at home, isolating his wife from his feelings.The film claims to be based on a true story from 2010. The double tap funeral incident depicted in the film happened in 2009. It may be better stated it was inspired by true events. A low budget 2013 film on the same topic is ""Drones.""""Good Kill"" is a drama that debates the drone issues but has no solid conclusions, except maybe to buy stock in drone manufacturers. The pro-drone elements are shown to be on the zealot side, leaning the perception of the debate to the left. The commander tells his trainees, ""This isn't Playstation"" but admits those who are good at X-Box are recruited for the position.Guide: F-bomb. Sex. No nudity."
" Eye on the sky
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,5,"This is a war movie debating a moral dilemma. What if arcade games became real and you could just blast people from the sky?Major Thomas Egan (Ethan Hawke) is a cool pilot. He does not drink a lot, he does not curse a lot. A fighter pilot who is currently operating drones from some unknown location near his home in Las Vegas. Egan wants to go back to flying planes. His superior Lt Colonel Jack Johns (Bruce Greenwood) tells him that this is the modern face of aerial combat. Remote killing whether both of them like it or not.One bunch of people who like drone warfare is the CIA. They order attacks in Afghanistan, Yemen and other places and play little regard to the Geneva Convention. Egan and a few others such as new crew member Vera Suarez (Zoe Kravitz) have doubts as to the legality of these orders and whether they are committing a war crime. The others in the team do not care as long as they get to kill Muslims. Not even contemplating that 'just following orders' is no defence to a war crime charge.At one point it is mentioned what if the enemy gets drones and one day starts to attack US cities in retaliation. No one can come up with an answer. At least the film contemplates it.Egan's life unravels, his marriage starts to disintegrate as he cannot talk to his wife about his job. His dream of flying fighter planes remain distant.Good Kill written and directed by Andrew Niccol, never really becomes a good movie. Egan is affected by the things he has to do, the screenplay just feels heavy handed and almost looks like a stage play."
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,6,"Major Tom Egan (Ethan Hawke) is a decorated Air-force pilot, who after five deployments, has been assigned to a base in Las Vegas, where he conducts drones strikes over Afghanistan. He hates his job and feels like a coward, but things get a whole lot worse, when the CIA commissions his team to start doing questionable jobs. Egan starts to come apart and take it out on his co-workers and family, leading to an uncertain future. IFC films are right at the top of my list right now as the absolute best in independent film. Seldom have they disappointed me, and I wouldn't describe my feelings about Good Kill as disappointed, but rather indifferent. This film, based on a true story, was exceptionally written and features a fantastic director and an amazing cast, but it also moves at a snails pace and is extremely repetitive. It's just drone strike, reaction, intervention, repeat, over and over again, followed by an ending that wasn't all that surprising. Ethan Hawke gives a powerful performance, despite the fact that he lacks the kind of emotion this role sorely needed. I understand that having Egan be this stone cold guy on the outside is a major theme, but it also makes for a lot of seemingly endless conversations and interactions. Good Kill has a lot of elements I look for in a movie, it's well written, has a cast I really enjoy, a director I know very well, still, it's lacking in emotion and levity. The film is monotonous and much longer than it had to be, all in all, not bad, but not great."
" Watch ""Eye in the Sky"" instead
",2018-06-30 00:00:00,3,"6/30/18. Way too slow in its brooding approach to the moral consequences of drone warfare. It looks like they reused the explosion footage 10x. No kidding. Talking about low budget. This movie is almost the same as ""Eye in the Sky"" with Helen Mirren, which was much better in generating suspense and questions about why we should ever resort to drone warfare. Why not just have video wargames replace real warfare why you're at it."
" Cliche-Ridden, Boring Movie
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,3,"If you're excited by the war on terror and want to be lectured on the morality of the drone war circa 2010 then you might enjoy this movie but only if you have a high tolerance for boredom. This movie has the soldier's stereotypical messy home life, stereotypical moral dilemmas, stereotypical PTSD and stereotypical problems with self-medication. I've liked January Jones' acting in other roles but in this role she is devoid of sincerity. Will Ethan Hawke;s character rebel from his immoral assignment? Will his marriage survive? Will he get together with the hot enlisted woman? So many questions we don't care about."
" Watch ""Drones"" Instead
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,6,"Languid expose of US drone warfare from the operators' perspective. Good intentions but lacks real tension, becomes repetitive. For me, it became too involved with effects on Major Egan's personal relationship. ""Drones"" is a better treatment of the same subject. Even though that film may lack some of the background (political) detail given here it is more gripping. And the Afghani targets become more real than here where they remain figures on a screen."
" not suit to Americans
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,8,"It too true, too realistic, too brutally honest, to Americans. Your brain will hurt, your American proud will be hurt. So no wonder it's only made some 300K$ at box office. LOL. As one of the solider said, we can kill faster than they make it, guess lots Americans think the same...well hope U.S.A understands, he is talking about genocide an entire race, well, which indeed can be an outcome of the vicious circle."
" Delivers a very good and mindful point.
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,6,"Ethan Hawk dwells in this movie right away. He is such an amazing actor, from my point of view, showing it here once again. He bleeds with emotions in each scene possible. The movie shows the ethics of war, the psychologial terror this people go through, while taking orders from the upper ""floor"". It shows the reality and the real number of times, people doubt and rethink their profession of killing others, taking innocents along the road. Again, as I feel about a lot of other movies, I think that the pace is a bit slow, but the point of the movie actually doesn't ask for a pacy movie at all, so I might be wrong."
" We are living in the future
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,8,"This movie looks like a sci fi movie, but it isn't. 
It looks like a Bourne franchise movie, but it is not that, either.
This movie is what the war looks like today. No more US soldiers back in coffins covered by Star'n'stripes flag, they say.
OK, folks, I have bad news. Drones can be driven by your enemies, too.
Not only the Good Guys from Pentagon and CIA have drones, but Russian and Chinese, too. And these weapons can be bought and sold, just like nuclear weapons. War leads nowhere. It is just a lot of money in weapon Corporations pockets, in the US, just like here in Italy and everywhere.
War to terrorism leads nations like US and Israel to be terrorist themselves. This is history not my opinion.This movie tries to show how human can be a drone based war. Maybe even worse PTSD effects. Alcoholic and psychotic disorders instead of physical injures. We can see Major Tom going down a spiral of madness through alcohol, impotence, seclusion and anger which raises its acme when he shoots the 7,000 miles away raper, like an almighty vigilante.It is not strange that this movie got mild average ratings (as Jarhead (2005))
Most people simply don't get it. They probably think like M.I.C. Joseph Zimmer (the one who talked about how green is Virginia to new women soldiers) 
they kill us, we kill them. No time for stopping and reflecting about military mistakes.
It remember an interview a few decades ago, in which Buzz Aldrin (1930), the astronaut who was with Armstrong first mission on the Moon, said he wanted to nuke terrorists. This explains a lot about Trump victory and making US great again!"
" Grim, powerful stuff.
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,8,"I had very low expectations of this film, expecting a sanitized Hollywood ""product"" with a toothy pilot bravely quitting his job on the one freak occasion that he's ordered to do something morally questionable.It wasn't like that at all. In fact, he's ordered to do something morally questionable almost on a daily basis. And he does it. Every time. And then he goes home to his wife. Day after day after day. The film bears a strong resemblance to newspaper articles I've read about drone pilots - who reportedly, do indeed go off the rails due to the corrosive nature of the work, ie, either killing from a safe distance or watching powerlessly as allied troops are attacked themselves (by IEDs - the closest thing the enemy has to drones).This film does a great job of depicting the disintegration of Ethan Hawkes' mind as he's continually ordered to commit what are, by any definition of the word, war crimes. Even if you still agree with the war, by the end of the film you'll be thinking ""This is not a job for a normal human being. This is a job for psychopaths or possibly artificial intelligences""."
" Way too worthy
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,3,"GOOD KILL is a worthy ethical drama masquerading as a military thriller. Ethan Hawke plays a drone operator who spends his days blowing up targets at the behest of the US government, but eventually the stress of the job takes its toll and he begins to crack. I found this long-winded story to be pretty depressing, if I'm honest; the subject matter is an interesting one but not so here. I found the whole thing, morals and all, done much better in EYE IN THE SKY. Hawke downplays it on autopilot, and only Zoe Kravitz shines as his friendly colleague. The marriage drama stuff is particularly gruelling and uninteresting. The worst thing about this? It's a film about ideas, methods, and feelings, but they forgot to put the humanity in."
" Wow! Excellent movie! ... typical that it did not receive a wider release
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,10,"So much better than that Helen Mirren 2015 p.o.s. Eye-in-the-sky propaganda piece. Before the limited release of ""Good Kill"" in 2015, I saw it advertised in Tribute magazine, and kept waiting for it to come out. Now in 2017, just saw another great Ethan Hawke acting-choice ""Maudie"", and thought, ""Hey, where is that drone movie?""... then ordered ""Good Kill"" DVD. If you want to understand why, ""Good Kill"" is the better movie, then read every book ever written by Peter Dale Scott.Enough said. Thanks to all the brave people who made this movie happen. An important record that will stand the test of time, and inform future generations about how barbaric our civilisation is."
" True and honest
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,10,"A daring movie about a painful subject.I'm so glad that from time to time there's a movie with a good, honest and true story and with good performers. True and honest, no matter how it will make you look or feel. I could really feel the characters, especially Ethan Hawke with his master performance!Honest story and honest acting."
