" unwatchable camera work
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,1,Very amateur camera work and extremely boring plot.
" At least as good as the original ""the Mechanic""
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,8,"Less. Realistic and good script. Realistic
Even the ""return"" to pick up his job is not unrealistically. It all makes sense. Off cause some actions seem to be exaggerated for a normal human being. Conclusion: worth watching if you like ""action"""
" A movie for morons
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,2,This movie doesn't merit a review. Our hero caught up to a $50 million yacht using a 2 horsepower personal underwater propeller. That's the reality of the rest of the film too.
" A lot better than expected
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,8,"Just watched this going in thinking ""its just gonna be some braindead rubbish to pass the time"" but it was actually a very creative and fun fast paced action flick."
" Star Power Only
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,5,"There are only 2 reasons you would watch this move and they are the main stars.Beyond that, this follow up lacks anything that would capture your imagination or your heart.The movie looks flash, so it had a budget but there was no attempt to make anything more than a XXX of Fast Furious clone/knock-off as they wait for the franchise dollars to roll in!You like the stars you will tolerate the movie!"
" Amazing
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,10,"It's amazing film, such as every other film of Jason but this one is particularly interesting because of the background of the stories. Also the fact that Jason performs all his stunts it's kind of shocking! I don't understand the bad ratings but in my opinion it's a very good film, I totally recommend it!!!"
" Someone Should Have Called the Mechanic to Resurrect this Film
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,2,"Mechanic: Resurrection, sees the return of Jason Statham as the badass Arthur Bishop, who after the events of the first film, fled to South America to live a seemingly normal life. However, thanks to an old friend, the ex-hitman is forced out of retirement and contracted to carry out three assassinations. Alongside Jessica Alba and Tommy Lee Jones, the stakes have never been higher for Statham's character, or that's what the film wants you to believe anyways.Directed by Dennis Gansel, Mechanic: Resurrection, released in the summer of 2016, five years after the release of the first film. This time around, the film shed its gritty nature of the predecessor in favour of a broader colour pallet, more action and even goofier dialogue. However all that culminates into what seems like a very cheap, poorly made film. The first act to this movie is absolutely dreadful, it is so ridiculously slow to the point where you feel bored to tears, and the action in the opening sequence is laughingly bad. The CGI and green screen work was absolutely abhorrent, that would make you think you were watching some movie made for under a million dollars. The way the action is presented during this sequence is so weirdly directed that it was difficult to comprehend how bad the film was. It features these shaky-cam moments with the subjects clearly in focus and just the background is unstable. It's super disorientating and left a bad taste in my mouth.It doesn't help that the film screeches to a halt for 20 minutes, as the filmmakers force a relationship between Statham and Alba, as to set up the plot for the rest of the film. Luckily the film does get a bit better in its final two acts. The plot is very videogame-esque, with Bishop tasked with completing three separate assassinations, that appear to be near impossible. The big baddie is someone that blackmails Bishop into completing these tasks and does not have his best intentions in mind, and taking him out also seems unlikely due to his influence. All this just seems like a plot to a Ubisoft game or something, and the action that follows also feels like it would be cool to play. Although it is quite goofy, I did enjoy the mindless action, I found the the three targeted missions to be dumb but also a little fun.Despite the change of pace, Mechanic: Resurrection cannot escape its brutal opening and poorly executed presentation, with so many fade-to-black moments making the entire film feel so choppy with pointless scenes. The acting isn't also something to write home to about, it's serviceable given the goofy dialogue and plot, which I must add is incredibly questionable. There is a sequence in the film wherein after Bishop completes one of his assignments returns to try and take out the guy that's giving him orders, however all this just leads to nowhere outside of a 7 minute action scene. It just feels relatively pointless outside of establishing that the antagonist is well fortified and that it will take Arthur a lot of effort to kill him. Much of this movie is littered with moments like that, where Bishop makes questionable decisions that sort of oppose the characterization that he is a ""smart"" guy.Mechanic: Resurrection, is bad. Sadly it's not bad enough to categorize as a ""so bad its good film"". There were sequences that I enjoyed but there were also moments that were particularly difficult to get through, most notably the first act, which was so obscenely bad that I was preparing myself for the worst. Although the film does pull itself out from the putridness of its opening 30 minutes, its still not enough to save the film as it is very poorly made and for that reason I am giving Mechanic: Resurrection a 2/10"
" Enjoyable
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,6,"I want to love this movie... I really do. Great actors, lovely scenery, some really cool action sequences. Statham is entertaining as always. But the story fails a bit. It is not logical and it feels like you press ""Fast forward"" and skips important parts of the story. Did they cut off too much? Yes. Too jumpy story to get more stars."
" Nope
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,3,The fact that the next movie the director did after directing this trash was Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver says a lot about this movie
" Mechanic: Resurrection
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,4,"I watched the original, a remake of the film starring Charles Bronson, a few years, I saw the trailer for the sequel and had a feeling, despite looking fairly cool, it would be disappointing, but I decided to go with it anyway. Basically, since faking his death, Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) has been living quietly in Rio de Janeiro. Renee Tran (Rhatha Phongam) is a courier who knows his true identity and approaches him. Her employer wants Bishop to kill three targets and make their deaths look like accidents. Bishop manages to escape her and the mercenaries and flees to Thailand. He stays at the resort island beach house of his friend, Mei (Michelle Yeoh), and learns that Tran is working for his former childhood friend Riah Crain (Sam Hazeldine). Some time later, Gina Thornton (Jessica Alba), comes to Mei wanting aid for her bruises before returning to a boat anchored nearby, where Mei sees her being beaten by a man onboard. Mei calls Bishop, and together they rescue Gina. The two men fight, and Bishop accidentally kills the man, and is unable to identify him, after this he sets the boat of fire. While Mei tends to Gina's injuries, Bishop finds that Gina is also connected to Crain. She reveals that Crain had threatened the children's shelter in Cambodia that she runs unless she got close to Bishop in an effort to force him to do the assassinations. Over the next few days, Bishop gets to know Gina better and they fall in love. As expected, however, Crain's mercenaries arrive and abduct them. Crain keeps Gina hostage to ensure Bishop completes the assassinations. The first target is a warlord named Krill (Femi Elufowoju Jr.), who is being held in a Malaysian prison. Bishop gets himself imprisoned, and gains Krill's trust saving his life. Bishop then kills Krill himself and escapes with the help of Crain's operatives. The next target is Adrian Cook (Toby Eddington), a billionaire and former trafficker of underage sex workers. Bishop climbs Cook's penthouse apartment to evade the tight security, and breaks the glass bottom of his overhanging pool, sending Cook plummeting to his death. While giving details of the third target, Crain lets Bishop speak to Gina, who repositions the camera so that Bishop can identify Crain's boat. Bishop attempts a rescue, but Crain thwarts it and demands Bishop to complete the last assassination, giving him 24 hours. The final target is Max Adams (Tommy Lee Jones), an American arms dealer in Varna, Bulgaria. Bishop plans the job, but realises Adams is Crain's only major competition. Bishop instead approaches Adams to warn him and get his help. Bishop fakes Adams' death and reports to Crain that he was successful. Bishops is directed to Crain's submarine pen, where he decimates Crain's mercenaries then makes for Crain's boat. He fights off more of Crain's men and rescues Gina. He discovers the boat is rigged with explosives and puts Gina in a diving bell. Bishop kills the remaining mercenaries, then overpowers Crain and secures him to the boat. Crain and, seemingly, Bishop, are killed when the boat explodes. The remains of the boat are salvaged boat. Gina returns to Cambodia and to teaching and is surprised when Bishop appears. Adams discovers how Bishop survived and destroys the evidence in gratitude for sparing his life. Also starring John Cenatiempo as Jeremy, Anteo Quintavalle as Frank, and Bonnie Zellerbach as Headmistress. Statham is suitably tough, Alba looks great, and Jones is an interesting choice as a hipster arms dealer, it is fairly simple but also predictable story, but there are some set pieces and cool chase and explosive sequences that get your attention, just as silly as the predecessor, a daft but alright action thriller. Okay!"
" This beats its predecessor, which I did enjoy
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,7,"Improves upon the first film, which is a rather impressive feat.I felt thoroughly entertained throughout this. I do like Jason Statham films admittedly, sure he plays very similar roles each time but I find myself enjoying the vast majority of his work. 'Mechanic: Resurrection' is no different.Statham is excellent as he reprises Bishop. I rate his performance, just like in 'The Mechanic'. I find what Bishop encounters in this film much more riveting than what happens in the 2011 production, it's class watching him go piece by piece; even if you have a fair idea what's going to happen.The aforementioned lead is notably joined by Tommy Lee Jones (Adams), Jessica Alba (Gina) and Michelle Yeoh (Mei). The latter two are unfortunately pretty basic characters, but Jones is very good in his role - I love the look and behaviour of Adams, entirely thanks to the actor himself. Sam Hazeldine (Crain) isn't a great villain, mind... kinda dull in fact.I always enjoy seeing films travel the world, as this visits numerous countries including Brazil, Malaysia, Australia and Bulgaria - it allows the story to feel global, as opposed to being limited to a random American state. I like the music, also.This beats its predecessor, which I did enjoy by the way. I'm not saying it is anything incredible, or even one of Statham's best, but all I can state is that I had a fun time."
" Enjoyed it with a few bevvies
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,6,Got me mates over to our clares for a few bevvies last sat night. Me mate Steve said its a true story.
" Mechanic: Dereliction
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,5,"I really quite enjoyed the original ""Mechanic"" (2011) so was quite looking forward to this... unfortunately, despite a decent enough cast on paper - this is not a very good film. When Jason Statham's girlfriend is kidnapped he is charged by nemesis ""Crain"" (Sam Hazeldine) to carry out three nigh on impossible murders and then to make them look accidental. Now one of his tasks - with a bloke in a cantilever swimming pool 80 stories up was quite good - it reminded me a bit of ""Diamonds Are Forever"" (1971) and there is quite a quirky appearance from Tommy Lee Jones in some fun slippers, but otherwise this is an overly digitised, sanitised and poorly constructed sequel that really makes little use of the star, nor of Jessica Alba or Michelle Yeoh who shows up for about three minutes too. The effects are well executed, and the thing looks OK, but it has nothing to get your teeth into and it is episodic style is quite sterile. It also happens to feature possibly the ugliest super-yacht ever built. Let's not have a third..."
" A Great Time Passer
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,8,"I like the movie its a typical American action movie, it has traditional cinematography and the acting is great from Jason Statham and Jessica Alba, I'd recommend the movie as a pass timer but its a shallow movie with no depth to it. The fighting scene in the movie are directed with poorness as our main character has super powers and no one from the others has any security skills to kill him or even injure him. in the fighting scene on the boat a lot of the security guards needed to wait until Jason Statham hit them or even shoot them. At 1:04:24 of the movie Jason Statham pulled the safety pin of the bomb and used the security guard as a human shield this move is unrealistic. This explosion would lead to Statham's death, which cannot happen as our lead character cannot die, he will pass gun wounds, knife cuts, bomb explosions and will survive but the enemies will not. Overall the movie is a great time passer but it will be a great commercial movie if Jason Statham worked more on his expressions as he maintained the same fake expression through out the movie and if the fighting scenes became more realistic."
" Good action movie
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,7,"I quite enjoyed this on the whole. Enjoyed the first one so when I saw this on Prime I had to chuck it on.My main issue was that I just wasn't sold on the romance side of the film. I wasn't assed about whether they got together at the end or not. They had known each other for a couple of days at best.The action scenes I really enjoyed, some good camera work and it was just fun to watch. That's what this film is isn't it? Just an hour and a half of action, I don't expect an overly interesting story (although I thought the plot was more than fine) that makes you think too much.
It's a typical Statham film, an almost brainless action flick. But that's what I enjoy and I need films like this.Ps Alba just wasn't it this film. Thought her performance wasn't fantastic won't lie. But after the first 20 mins or so she is barely in it."
" Mechanic Resurrection
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,5,Hit man the Stath's new best friend (Alba) is kidnapped by his arch enemy forcing him to make 3 impossible assassinations (one being Tommy Lee Jones) and make them look like accidents.Good action packed fun for an undemanding Friday night crowd. The 3 assassinations come quick and quite cleverly - they didn't look like accidents to me - and everything moves along as most of The Stath's films do - lots of well choreographed fight scenes and dark laconic humour.
" Blaaaahhhhh
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,4,"Nothing new from Stathem here, he needs to ask Guy Ritchie for more work, and Jessica Alba has allowed her career to stall by stubbornly refusing to get the acting lessons she so desperately needs"
" Mechanic: Bored Again
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,5,Jasin Stayfum does his best and a surprisingly well known cast are wasted in this boring and largely incomprehensible production. I only watched this film because it's on TV and my internet is down.
" AWESOME ACTION PACKED THRILLER & ONE OF STATHAM'S BEST FILMS!!!
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,7,"Jason Statham is Awesome & one of the best out there making these old school type action Thriller flicks just like Schwarzenegger, Stallone & Van Damme would've made back in the day & Statham fits in with the Action Legends now in his own right.Statham is back as the best of the best contract killer, Arthur Bishop & this time he's made to take out three big league targets for an old enemy of his & to assure he does as he's told, they've captured his new love, the beautiful Jessica Alba.
This sequel hit like the excellent ""Equalizer 2"" as a film that i put off watching for ages because i thought no way will it be as good as the first film & seemed like they was just trying to make a franchise out them for the sake of it but i was so wrong with both sequels because i ended up loving the sequels more than those Excellent first films!!!
""Resurrection"" is a fantastic slick & beautiful looking Action Thriller that often feels like a fun Spy film in the style of of ""James Bond"" a little as our pumped up hero is super smart & quick thinking & gets into the most secure places easily like a super spy but of course he's not, he's a super Assassin & is one of if not, Statham's best characters.
This fast-paced non-stop action fest has it all with beautiful locations & tropical waters & breathtaking stunts & action set pieces. The Action is quick & bone cruchingly fun with Statham kicking Ass the skilled way he does & plenty of gun play too.
Resurrection is definitely one of the most pure enjoyable & fun action films of Statham's Career & bringing a higher level of quality to this slick action film is a nice role for the ageing Hollywood legend, Tommy Lee Jones & he's Awesome here as an Arms dealer with morals & Jones gives him a likable quality even though he's basically a wacky bad guy but shares some nice scenes with Statham & just lifts the film up by his presence, i smiled whenever he was on screen.All in all this fun sequel is more entertaining & more re-watchable than it's grittier first film. Had a great time watching this thrill ride & is my favourite Statham film next to ""The Meg"""
" Definately Award Winning For The worst Film made
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,1,Just forget it & watch your tie nails growing. That's more interesting 😂
" Jessica Alba? Seriously??
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,5,"Jason Statham stays in, which is the only connection to the previous Mechanic. Ben Foster is out. Jessica Alba gets in. Two of these 3 decisions were pretty bad.Jason Statham is being Jason Statham, who plays a superior assassin, but lacks interest the second he doesn't have a better acting supporting co-star. The first half of this movie is forgettable at best. Only in the 2nd half when the speed is turned up, you'll have some entertaining action and kills, which makes the movie slightly better, but still nothing more than a shadow of the previous movie."
" People give this garbage 10/10?
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,1,I love Stathan. I love action movies! But my god this is horrible! I am just wondering... People that give this movie a 6+ score must be lobotomized or they have never ever seen another movie in their lives... shame
" Love for Alba
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,10,Two of my most favourite actors in a film is enough for me to give 10.
" Very good movie
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,9,"The usual plot, ingenious escapes, and explosions but nothing new in the way of plot. That doesn't make it dull, however.This time, Bishop, the most dangerous hit man in the world, is living in the South Seas, believing he's at last left his past behind. He's blackmailed into leaving ""retirement"" to do three kills...Of course he does it, with plenty of fisticuffs, acrobatic skills"
" Illogical and outdated
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,3,"Illogical , bad acting , sick and outdated plot . One of the worst movie by statham. Nothing good about movie except Jason statham's action"
" Watchable despite it's flaws
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,6,"It's may be shallow on contents,but it's oddly satisfying watch. The fight scenes are Jason's trademark as always. The fight in the very beginning will make you believe that's it's not going to waste your time. Give it a try, it's mindless fun."
" Very predictable
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,6,"Fun action as usual, the plot is paper thin but works. Writing didn't make sense at times."
" Boring
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,3,There was no need for a sequel but they made it anyway.
" Shakycam spoils it every time there is action...
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,3,"It would have been a good flick if it wasn't for the damn camera shaking around all over the place when ever there is a fight, bloody annoying when you are trying to watch something..."
" This is what Hitman should have been!
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,6,"I'm sure I saw the original movie, but can't remember it, or whatever came after it. I was craving some action, and this did the trick. The whole idea of the character though, made me think it should have been based on the Hitman video game, instead of those other 2 attempts. Make a murder look like an accident and even with disguises. Some good stunts and scenery, and one particularly cool assassination. Also, I miss Jessica Alba. She's not the best actress by far, but sure looks good in that bikini!"
" Just for fans of Jason Statham
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,5,"I suspected it from beginnen, that it would be one version of the many Jason Statham movies I watched before. It is banal in most every issues. Some scenes are worthy, I like the ideas. But all in all it's like all the other Statham-stand-allone movies, just less interesting. If you wanna see some well choreograped fights, click it. To see some better and more original action, watch some older movies of Statham or movies he did with other actors."
" Why?
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,1,The plot makes no sense at all. It's just unbearable to watch till the end.
" Disapointing
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,5,"After the realy good first movie, this is a disapointment. How does this big case fit in a Double bottom of a Cargo Container? This movie is dump. Fun, with a promising cast, but stupid. Or worse the maker of this movie believe we are stupid."
" Has its moments
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,6,"A sequel to the 2011 film The Mechanic, which is a story about Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham), a skilled hitman whose speciality is to makes his kills look like accidents. Now he's retired from that line of business, but an old rival of his finds him and puts the squeeze on him to kill some more.I liked the first film. It was tight, had Jason Statham in it, had some really cool scenes and featured enough surprises to make it interesting and worth my while. This sequel has Jason Statham and the cool scenes, but it's a bit scatterbrained and very predictable. We still get all the heists where Bishop meticulously plans and executes his kills, but the rest of the film is on tracks. You can pretty much tell how it's going to go from minute one.I also wish they had done a bit more with Jessica Alba's character. Now she's very much the damsel in distress. I though they were going to with another route for her character, but they missed that chance completely. She's merely in the movie to look pretty. Which she does, she's Jessica Alba after all, but her character could have been so much more.Still, if you liked the original film, this film is pretty much more of the same. It's not quite as good, but it's not entirely without merit."
" It's how agent 47/hitman movies should have been like
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,5,"However, the movie is enjoyable at the same time it's missing flavour.Its a colourful movie yet its missing a few more colours that could make this movie a master piece.I do not plan on watching the prequel because it does not feel like I'm left out of knowing what happened in the mechanic 1."
" Not Worth Watching
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,1,"Just a really bad movie overall. Does not follow suit at all with the first movie.
Very cliche, predictable, no real suspense. Protagonist doesn't face any real threat in the movie. It's just endless shooting..after the first 30 mins which provide nothing to the storyline.Save your time, don't watch it."
" Fun action sequel with Jason Statham
",2019-08-19 00:00:00,7,"After the events of the previous film hitman Arthur Bishop has faked his own death and retired to Rio de Janeiro where he lives under an assumed name. Unfortunately for him he is tracked down by people working for Riah Crain. Crain is an old friend turned enemy who wants Bishop to assassinate three people for him. Bishop manages to get away and move to an island off the Thai coast. Once again he is found; this time by a woman, Gina Thornton, forced to work for Crain. They fall in love then Crain's goons grab Gina and tell Bishop that if he doesn't take the job Gina will be killed. These hits will entail going after one man who is in an island prison off the Malaysian coast; another who lives in a secure penthouse in Sydney and finally a man who lives in a cold war era bunker in Bulgaria... then there is the problem that Crain might not keep his end of the deal.This film might not have a complex plot but it does serve to deliver a succession of exciting action sequences. This action is nicely varied with Jason Statham dispatching henchmen with knives, guns, grenades and his bare hands... there are a lot of henchmen that need dispatching! The main targets are each unpleasant in their own way so few viewers are likely to think Bishop is wrong to kill them to save Gina. Jason Statham is on fine form as Bishop; a fairly typical roll for him which should please fans. Jessica Alba is solid as Gina, getting in on the action a few times. Michelle Yeoh was somewhat underused and sadly took no part in the action... something that I'm sure will disappoint her fans. As is often the case in such films we are treated to a variety of stunning locations. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of good mindless action."
" Loved it
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,10,"Great plot, acting, action, blood, guts, stuff blowing up, everything my wife and I love in a movie."
" Dismal
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,3,"I watched this one night on TV just because it happened to be on - I had seen the first one. I'm not part of the Jason Statham fan club but equally they can be quite entertaining, this however is not.
The basic plot is simply ludicrous; ultra assassin (Statham) is coerced into killing bad guys for another bad guy to save the life of a girl (Alba) he's known barely 48 hours. Each kill is 'impossible' but Statham achieves it with ridiculous ease and the body count of goons just becomes a blur after a while - helped immensely by a silenced pistol that never runs out of bullets!
In the final showdown doing the obvious - kill the girl! seems to elude the bad guy and a sadistic death awaits him. Hero & Heroine reunited.
This was clearly done solely for the money and I'm sure Jason Statham did very nicely out of it while Alba, Yeoh and Jones are utterly wasted although I guess their pay check was pretty good. The losers are the audiences who paid good money at the cinema or wasted 140 minutes of their time."
" I can not unwatch this.
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,1,"This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
There was less CGI in the toy story movies.
I have so much dislike for this movie it is hard to find enough words. But I'll happly keep typing so that my review of this crap show counts.
JS what where you thinking.
""Hey let's go really cheap on all effects, get 3 big name people to star in the movie, have zero actual point and let me kill more people than Stalin in a short crap movie""Where was the bullet counters. I never have seen a pistol with 30 rounds in a mag that looks standard.Be realistic atleast 2% of the time people.
They put CGI where ever they could.
It isn't that hard to fly a real helicopter over Sydney and to film it. So next time do that.Please do not waste any time watching the movie.
Go watch the grass grow or cold water in a sink with a bow floating in it."
" We're only in it for the money
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,1,"Evidently the people who rate this highly and say ""c'mon it's just fun"" have no concept of what ""fun"" is. ...or...have an interesting perspective of what ""fun"" is.Jason Stratham kills 100+ ""actors"" (although skeet shooting clay target pigeons is probably a more accurate descriptor than ""actor""). This is what ""fun"" now is...slaughtering 100+ people. And not giving a (expletives deleted) about it.Fun is also an inexhaustible supply of ammunition, explosives and gadgetry all at ones fingertips to just use and go slaughter people. And nobody in the world really cares. Why? Because it is just Jason Stratham ""having fun.""That's all this ""movie"" is. If that is your perception of ""fun' then have at it. For the rest of the world who actually want something more entertaining than killing as many people as Cecil B Demille then don't bother."
" my notes
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,4,Some cool scenes but pretty stupid overall (1 viewing)
" I managed 10 minutes
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,1,"I have no idea why but the cinematography was so awful I couldn't get past 10 minutes, it's just so bad it's unwatchable . Daniel Gottschalk needs to find another job."
" Needed a better service
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,4,"Ace assassin Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is thought to be dead.In Mechanic: Resurrection Bishop has been tracked down in Rio de Janeiro. after faking his own death. His former associate Crain (Sam Hazeldine) sends some goons to force Bishop to do three assassinations and make them all look like accidents.Bishop fights them off and flees to Thailand where he comes to the rescue of abused Gina (Jessica Alba,) She is the bait that Crain kidnaps in order to force Bishop to carry out his tasks.This is a globe trotting action film, Brazil, Thailand, Australia, Bulgaria all enhanced with CGI. Some of the action scenes are fun such as the fight on the way to Sugar Loaf Mountain. The glass swimming pool job sticks out, but too much of the movie is generic and forgettable. The film grinds to a halt without the action scenes."
" Good action

I think the previous work was better"
" Good movie
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,9,I write to those who write very bad reviews about Jason Statham's Mechanic movies. Perhaps his movies are not your cup of tea. Perhaps choosing another action film actor would be the thing to do. Mr. Statham's movies do make money so (like myself) fans of his works can enjoy.
" There are no action movies to be made
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,5,"The first half of the movie is just too bad to be seen. There are no action movies to be made. The latter half can only be regarded as barely introductory, after all, there is no plot and logic at all. In summary, every agent is a chemist."
" One of the worst movies I painfuly had to watch
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,1,"I watched this movie because I was recommended it after watching Mechanic with same actor. That one was fine but the sequel is just rubbish. Terrible story, terrible actors and no point of this even being a movie. They did Mechanic because the story was already there from Bronson's original so with this sequel it's like they hired a glodfish to write this movie. Two writers to write this garbage? Both you writers couldn't even write a food label let alone a movie thats how rubbish it is. I would have given it 0/10 if i had an option to. How Jason agreed to this movie is beyond me. Maybe the money and Alba had something to do with it but still should have never agreed to destroying a good movie reputation with this trash."

" Becomes more and more by the numbers
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,6,"This movie starts out really well, nice execution of energy and action. There are some nice parallels at this point with Matt Damon as Jason Bourne in Bourne Supremacy (2004). Jason Statham's martial art or fighting form at this point is even more fascinating for its more realistic street style. Yet as the movie proceeds along, it becomes more and more by the numbers as even the odd, unnecessary use of a villain kidnapping and the attempted rescue on a large boat only seems to detract from the action. Jessica Alba gets to do a bikini reversal of the famous Ursula Andress reprise from James Bonds' Dr. No (1962). Statham's Arthur Bishop's intriguing use of weapons and bomb, however becomes more boring and tedious and even supposedly this assassin kills don't seem to have the riveting death scenes as even the mechanics don't have the same thrill as say Tom Cruise's Mission Impossible exploits. The movie eventually settles down by kill by the bullets eventually and unlike Hitman: Agent 47 (2015) the energy and power seems to fizzle more and more until a more pedestrian ending occurs."
" What did I just watch?
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,3,"Imagine a world where handguns carry 30 bullets in a single clip, where you can shoot forever and never have to reload. That is the world that Arthur Bishop lives in and boy does he love it. The Mechanic 2: Resurrection felt a little stale to me, don't get me wrong, it's basically as action packed as skydiving, except this movie didn't pack a parachute and it falls...hard. I think that action sequences were done greatly, but there is practically no storyline whatsoever, they try to create this love story, but it doesn't really make any sense. It also happens so freaking quickly, you are sitting there wondering, ""Wait, he loves her?"" Maybe I missed something from the first movie, but this movie just didn't do it for me."
" Not a bad action movie...(slight spoiler)

You get all pretentious about production values and plot inaccuracies and the acting and the direction, but I think you're missing the point. This film never set out to be a ""Usual suspects"" or ""Heat"", and I'm sure nobody involved in it ever thought it was going to a classic, few films are. Instead, what we have is a film designed to be watched after the pub on a Friday night with a beer and a spiff, and in that context it does the job moderately well.

Jessica Alba (didn't realize she was in it until after I rented it or it wouldn't have made it home with me in the first place) arrives and a complete cheese fest begins. Soap Operas are written better than this garbage. I don't understand what kind of person this was even written for. I would like to think my kids would have the good sense to shut this garbage off about the same time I did. Lame. Lame. Lame. Laughable that anyone would choose to participate in this mess. I didn't even make it long enough to see Tommy Lee Jones. He must be hurting for money to participate in this. Sad.

" Nail-biting thriller and un-stopped action with Jason Statham as a hot-headed and top hit-man
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,6,"Spectacular follow-up plenty of frantic action , thrills , intrigue and lots of violence . Sequel to ¨The mechanic¨ by Simon West , at the same time a remake from classic film directed by Michael Winner (1972) that was starred by Charles Bronson with screenplay by Lewis John Carlino . Thrilling movie about the very deadly rivalry between contact killers and in which the hardened elite hit-man Bishop performing a lethal mission . Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) is a very professional hit man who always works alone , he is the number one killing people with a bullet whose reputation has caught up with him. Bishop makes his missions of the way more mechanic and perfect, and that's why he is known as ¨The mechanic¨ . Present-day , he is retired , stressed and tired and living under a new secret identity, as Arthur Bishop has found shelter in noisy Rio de Janeiro. However, there takes place a set-up against him , and under the serious threat of being exposed by his arch-nemesis, a relentless killer called Riah Crain (Sam Hazeldine) , a former hired assassin and nowadays , a powerful gunrunner . Bishop will have no other choice but to agree in carrying out three dangerous suicide assignments across the four corners in the world . As his last assignment for an old colleague results to be the killing three important business men . But Bishop is caught in the middle of treason and threat .This crime thriller packs intrigue, suspense, noisy action-packed with grisly killings ,explosive excitement, thrills and lots of violence . This moving film is as calculating , cold and passionless as its central characters , two brutal enemies . Jason Statham with his usual hard acting displays efficiently his weapons and killing mercilessly his objectives . It's certainly thrilling , though the morality may be questionable , even in this time, as the spectators were clearly on the Statham's side in spite of being a cruel killer . Statham as a wealthy murderer for a powerful magnate offers the sort of strong acting as always. Furthermore, appears a nice secondary cast such as Jessica Alba as Bishop's love interest, but the romance isn't what this movie offers , it is about action and violence and director knows his work , as well as Sam Hazeldine , Michelle Yeoh , John Cenatiempo and special mention for veteran Tommy Lee Jones in a brief appearance as the millionaire Max Adams . 
  It packs stirring musical score composed, orchestrated and performed by Mark Isham . Colorful cinematography by Daniel Gottschalk with spectacular scenes filmed in several locations in Phuket, Thailand , Bangkok, Thailand , Penang, Malaysia , Sofia, Bulgaria ,Varna, Bulgaria , Buzludzha Mountain, Central Balkan Mountains, Balkan Mountains, Bulgaria Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, (Sugarloaf Mountain) ,Corcovado, Rio de Janeiro, Sydney Opera House , Macquarie Street, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia . This big hit motion picture was professionally directed by Dennis Gansel though with no originality , being a simple and plain vehicle for a big star : Jason Statham . German filmmaker Gansel has directed a few but successful films such as : The wave , Napola , We Are the Night and Berlin I love you . The director Dennis Gansel 's well-oiled techniques generate some explosive entertainment and excitement,as usual . This is an acceptable film about a deadly rivalry among killers , thrilling kidnapping and restless rescue that will appeal to Jason Statham fans and action lovers ."

" A hilarious action film with an inept plot.
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,5,"If London Has Fallen came out last year instead of this year, Mechanic: Resurrection would be considered the London Has Fallen of 2016. Three months from now, I probably won't remember much of this other than the fact that Statham was in it and a bunch of boats explode, and not just because it's forgettable and incredibly stupid. The story was pretty weak and despite the fact that I just saw this like three hours ago, I've already forgotten the villain's name.Oh yeah, and I guess Jessica Alba was in it.Luckily, the stupidity this film proudly wears on its forehead is one of the many types of stupidity I can thoroughly enjoy if done right, and I can safely say that Mechanic: Resurrection was both pleasingly stupid and probably the most decent a film with 'Resurrection' in the title could possibly be. The reason why I keep mentioning this and London Has Fallen is because both movies pretend to take themselves seriously and feature protagonists that are so humourless that they essentially become the opposite. Just look at those frowns on their faces. They are deadpan comedy acts, scowling their way through over-the-top carnage and jump-edited fight scenes. While Gerard Butler has shown some range in his other films (including a couple other action films), Jason Statham continues to prove that he's only got one act--which I'm sure he's well aware of, given that the Crank films utilized his knack for uber-seriousness to full comedic effect. This act of his is actually one of the reasons why his fans (including me) find him so entertaining to watch. He's like a lowkey Schwarzenegger with a British accent.So when I mentioned that the story was weak, I meant that it involves some dude from Arthur Bishop's past kidnapping his girlfriend and then telling him that he has to do three impossible assassination jobs in a specific number of hours in order to get her back. Oh, and they have to look like accidents.But see, here's my problem with that plan. I don't usually do this, but anyway; if you consider these spoilers, you can skip the next three paragraphs, and I've set the spoiler button on just in case, but since they happen in the first twenty minutes of the movie and set the whole plot into motion, I don't really count them as spoilers, so whatever.Our villain wants Bishop to do these jobs before he even kidnapped his girlfriend, but he refused because he wants to stay ""dead"" after the events of the first movie and then flees to Thailand like every sensible action protagonist does when they need to live a new life under the radar. The villain's solution? 
 He kidnaps Jessica Alba and sends her to the island Bishop is hiding with an ""abusive boyfriend"" whom Bishop kills and saves her from. But if it weren't for a horribly misplaced Michelle Yeoh (seriously, Ms. Yeoh, why would you let them do this to you?) with whom Bishop is also friends with noticing the scuffle on a boat floating a good distance away from the island, Bishop would've never even known about it. And if poor Ms. Yeoh didn't turn his attention to it and give him a quick moral motivation sentence to get him to change his mind about minding his own business, he wouldn't have gotten involved even if he DID know about it. And since our villain knew him since childhood, one would think he would've seen the flaw in the first step of that plan.But it gets even better: the villain not only expects Bishop to save Random Jessica Alba, but he also expects him to fall in love with her in such a short amount of time so that when he eventually sends his goons to kidnap her, he'll be too scared for her life to say no. His entire plain hinges on this cold professional assassin falling in love with a random stranger in the course of two days. He didn't stop to consider that maybe the man he blames for leaving him behind in a war zone so many years ago wouldn't care about what happens to Jessica Alba when he kidnaps her? He didn't think the amount of time he gave Bishop to fall for Jessica Alba might not be enough? What if Bishop didn't care what happened to Jessica Alba? Would he let his goons try to use brute force to persuade him like they failed to do in the opening scene? Why wouldn't he just try this honeypot thing with Jessica Alba first so that he could get Bishop when his guard is relatively down instead of trying it when he's already chased him off to Thailand with his guard raised to maximum? And why Jessica Alba? Was Eva Green too busy?It would make a little more sense if he mentioned that Bishop still has some kind of moral code that would keep him from letting Jessica Alba die, but throughout the whole movie, he goes on about how he would do anything to save Jessica Alba because he's so in love with her or something. He's THAT convinced that part of his plan worked. The rest of the movie's preposterousness at least makes sense compared to this one stupid detail. This plan should've already failed before it even started! The best thing about this is that the villain died believing that his plan actually worked, and never once was corrected by Bishop or anyone else with any shred of common sense.Anyway, the three jobs Bishop has to do are fairly clever in a low rent Jason Bourne/James Bond kind of way. They're probably the few highlights the film actually has, aside from the boat battles and the hilariously stupid glider scene at the beginning of the film. It's a good thing this movie didn't take itself so seriously, or else I might not have had nearly as much fun as I did. The action scenes are entertaining, but not all that engaging, and the music is serviceable at best. Tommy Lee Jones stuck out a bit as an eccentric gun runner with far too little screentime, and despite this being intentionally deadpan-comedic in its presentation (I hope), I feel as though they missed an opportunity to explore some of Bishop's background to make him seem a bit more human and add a more personal connection to the villain whose name I've unregrettably forgotten. Because of the nonexistence of that element, the villain just comes off as a whiner with a big boat and a chip on his shoulder. ""You left me to die"" is about as fleshed-out as his character gets, and that does a service to the film's short runtime, but a disservice to its already shallow, unoriginal plot.Having caught this on closing night, I felt kind of lucky, because I didn't even know that this was showing in my local theatre until I walked by it earlier today and saw ""ENDING THURSDAY"" slapped across its poster. Lucky me! I went in with low expectations and came out a happy man knowing that Jason Statham hasn't changed a bit since his last movie and probably never will!"
" Move Along, Folks. Nothing To See Here.
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,5,"Watching this movie, you get the nagging feeling that the filmmakers were just going through the motion of creating a generic action film and could care less about presenting anything new on the screen.To say the bad guys were one-dimensional and derivative would be the understatement of the year. Jessica Alba's character was painful to watch. A school teacher with martial arts skills out of the blue like that? I don't think so. Tommy Lee Jones could've played his role in his sleep. As a matter of fact, he WAS asleep since he was shown in his pajamas. Skip this turkey and look for action elsewhere."

" Tommy Lee Jones character is the highlight of this movie
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,3,The stunning views & Tommy Lee Jones are about the best things in this movie & really his character could have been more. Story line & action started off great then it fell apart once Bishop made it to the island. Love Jason Statham but this one fell flat for me.
" I love Jason Statham!
",2018-04-27 00:00:00,7,"First off let me tell you this as a disclaimer. I have a bit of an obsession with Jason Statham. It must be said before I continue, and yes it is hard to be objective about a movie that he stars in.Ok on to the specifics! the movie itself is 98 minutes long (1 hour & 38 minutes). Sometimes I want these movies to last longer, but they also have to have the content to extend them. So I believe, even though I want more, that this length is perfect for this type of movie. It is set in the genres above and that is spot on. It has an R rating, due to the nature of the violence and the language used throughout the movie. The language is generally sporadic and not the main reason for this rating. This is indeed the sequel to the 2012 movie ""The Mechanic"" (which I also loved). Jason Statham plays Arthur Bishop who is an assassin that specialized in accidental deaths. Jessica Alba plays his love interest Gina, and the curve ball of the group is Tommy Lee Jones who plays Max Adams one of Bishop's targets.So the story line is simply this: Bishop left his old life and assumed a new name. He is found by his old frienemy Crain (Sam Hazeldine). Crain wants Bishop to come out of his hiding/retirement and assassinate three high profile targets to keep his secret identity safe. Clearly like any movie he doesn't respond well, but is later put into a situation where Gina, is captured and held hostage until he eliminates the targets. Of course like always he has to keep each kill looking like an accident, in order to ensure the safety of Gina. You will have to watch and see about Tommy Lee Jones, I don't want to ruin it. That is about all I can say about it without giving anything away. I for one don't know if Jessica Alba was the right choice for this role. Yes she is/was a high profile star for some time. Yes she is attractive, but I feel like they shot too high for the roll in a way. I feel like it would be a better movie if there wasn't such a household name, so to speak, in that role. So in a way that is a compliment to Alba haha.Jason Statham has been my favorite actor for years now. I like, in a way, that he has stayed a 'B' list actor all while continuing to be the star in movies. His fight scenes in any movie are amazing. They are well thought out, well written, and very different than most. He opts to fight by hand to hand combat and use his soundings to his advantage. His slight accent makes him perfect for a ton of roles, as well as his physique, and demeanor. This movie, does have plenty of action, unlike ""Atomic Blonde"" which I reviewed previously. Yes is had fight scenes, but it also has helicopters, explosions, dangerous people, risky stunts, and more. This movie was never received well, partly because it isn't as main stream, and partly because it is a sequel to another movie that wasn't received all too well. That doesn't mean that it isn't a good movie.There are a couple negatives about this movie as well. This is the hard part for me to admit haha. Some of the explosions and fire graphics are far too fake. They really seem like they took no time at all to make them seem any bit real. Again being a bit picky, movies like this tend to allow pistols to hold 50 round magazines without having to re-load. This movie is guilty of that, unfortunately. The sound track is just blah, as it is your typical action suspense sounds. It was never there to be a hit sound track, and it won't be. I like to have a well rounded movie and that does in cooperate things like music and CGI. I want the whole package and this movie, like mannny others falls flat at times. In summary I love Jason Statham. I love his movies. I think his love interest was casted wrong, but it is only a minor thing. It is a typical action movie if that is what you are looking for. It has every piece you want to see, and you should watch it at least once. that way you can judge for yourself! :DThat all being said I would recommend watching this movie in any capacity! I personally give this movie a 6.5/10"

" Don't bother
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,3,Jason reprises the role created for Charles Bronson 40+ years ago. The action scenes are so speeded up and jumpy I was getting eyestrain. A by the numbers script makes this Mechanic very mechanical.

Which action film has ever been realistic, we know they're not, just damn good entertainment, which this is. This film is much better than it's prequel, a remake. I watch a film for entertainment, not to pick fault with storylines or realities. One of Jason Stathams good one's here."
" Nothing like it's predecessor
",2018-02-12 00:00:00,5,"Nice action-packed movie, but it can't match the prequel. The storyline is interesting, but not very credible. Where its predessor was well-thought, this one feels like its made in a hurry. For the rest its like an average action movie."
" Terrible
",2018-02-09 00:00:00,1,"Jason Statham performs his usual, action packed, indestructible man who can do it all sequence, but the plot is terrible.
Jessica Alba is among the worst actresses out there, and this movie is a perfect example to prove it.

" Bad portrayal of Penang ...cheap movie

He manages to escape to a remote location in Thailand where he is quickly discovered with Jessica Alba, who was planted there by Crain...against her will. After a one night stand, Crain captures the two of them and ""forces"" Bishop to assassinate three people or Jessica gets it. With Alba being the best squeeze on the market, Bishop succumbs. The swimming pool murder scene was a little better than the first one.The film has some minor twists at the end, but nothing major, being closer to a Seagal film, than ""The Usual Suspects."" Other than a bikini, Alba didn't bring anything to the screen as most of the acting was bland. Even Tommy Lee Jones phoned it in. And where does Bishop get a water proof cell phone that works anywhere in the world, even on remote islands? Guide: F-word, brief sex. No nudity"
" Film tourism with some trouble
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,2,"Wandering through Rio, Thailand, Malaysia, Bulgaria, Bond style. We have an actress who was in a Bond, Michelle Yeoh, here in a small role. Jason Statham and Jessica Alba, they are not exactly what could be called actors, they are just presences. More interesting would have been if Jessica had beard, and Jason would have occurred in bikini. But we have a great actor in this film, Tommy Lee Jones, a true delight, even in a lesser role stretch. Charles Bronson definitely is twisting in his grave."
" Horrible movie.
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,1,"Horrible movie. Poor effects, script, acting. A movie with zero intelligence and respect for it's viewers. Everything from start to finish is so predictable, all problems are solved easily, it's just not reliable.

" Arnold Level Body Count
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)Who cares what the story is about; this is a shoot 'em up brainless flic. The reason why Statham busts out his skills is the most vanilla you can imagine. Former gun for hire retires and is forced back to do one last series of jobs to save this woman he only just met but just has to rescue. Who cares when you watch him gun down so many men that is becomes obscenely comical. This blood bath earns a 6/10 because they somehow, in this watered-down genre, find slightly new ways to kill people. Got to credit the creativity. Haha. Some actually made me audibly grunt with amusement like a teenage kid. The three men he is hired to kill are actually fairly amusing, over the top yet spectacular. T. L. Jones does not need to be in this. Is he really hurting for money? Jessica Alba does not act very convincingly and their romance is just barely passable. If you want to suspend some disbelief and go on an amusingly bloody ride this works."
" awful awful awful
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,1,This movie really is really awful. When it started in Brazil I thought great. Nice scenery. Lots of attractive men. I should have known when the location changed from Brazil to Thailand.I got as far as the first sex scene. Why use abused children as a plot contrivance while the lead is banging a woman who looks young enough to be his daughter. Really offensive.As it turns out Alba is 36 not 16 to his 50 but the dreadful image is still there.Doesn't Thailand have any normal women? Or attractive men?
" Too poor
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,2,"When you want to watch a movie with Jason statham, out at looking for some action. But this does not mean you don't mind if the story of the film be totally bullshit..Unfortunately the director and the writer of this movie are not aware of this fact, and they come up with a movie with totally poor content. If a 5-year- old girl wants to make a story, she will probably have better logic. The sort is unbelievably stupid.. This is that sort of movies that that just pay some famous actors and actress to make film more actractive.. in fact aside from famous actors others factors involved in the movie are completely ridiculous. The story is totally nonsense...even action scenes are mostly laughable.. The writer had an attempt to make a contract killer a good person who cares about others and this exacerbates the situation."
" A poor sequel that takes the ridiculous route
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,3,"I recently watched the first Jason statham mechanic film and I found it okay but now I have seen the sequel and this film make the first one look great because of how bad resurrection is. The premise of the film sees after somebody he cares about is kidnapped Arthur bishop is forced to go after three targets. As mentioned before Jason statham plays the lead in this film and you get what you expect, he is very brooding in this and plays the tough guy well, which helps sell him in the action scenes. However, I found his character to be way more interesting in the first film and I felt him to just be there with me not caring about him in this film. The supporting cast is big let down, Jessica alba plays his love interest in this film and she is simply eye candy not providing much more then that, it doesn't help that her and statham don't really have any chemistry together in this film. Tommy lee Jones has a small role in this film and if his role had been expanded it might have worked but he just wasn't given enough time to get his performance across. The villain is the ultimate cliché and feels like they didn't even care to try and think of a compelling villain for this film. The story is also as cliché as you can get, it feels pretty repetitive as statham goes for his targets and I just ended up not caring about anything story related in this film. The script has some pretty cheesy dialogue in it and all I'll say is that I didn't care about any of the drama and I never laughed so this script truly failed. The style of the film though was pretty cool, the action scenes were all filmed really well and it was fun to watch statham come up with these unique creative kills. Overall this is a bad film that hopefully ends this mechanic franchise."
" Why so negative?
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,6,"I read the bad reviews, and had to scroll down quite a way to find a half-decent one. When I am in the mood for an entertaining action movie, I am prepared to suspend a LOT of disbelief and I can forgive very very big plot holes. And I enjoyed this film.Jason Statham is his own brand, I personally LOVE both Crank movies, Transporter 1-3 are lots of fun; The Mechanic I enjoyed more on second viewing, and expecting more of the same from Mechanic: Resurrection I wasn't disappointed. The Statham does his thing, he's not worried about the plot, why would he be? Jessica Alba should make more action movies, she, along with Michelle Rodriguez, could each carry an action franchise in their own right.If you have enjoyed Statham movies before, you could probably EASILY find a worse way of spending 90 minutes of your life than watching this movie."
" Much better than I was expecting
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,7,"MECHANIC: RESURRECTION is a sequel to the first film, which itself was a remake of an old '70s vehicle for Charles Bronson. Jason Statham returns as the bald-headed assassin for a new story in which he finds himself forced to assassinate a trio of targets in order to save a kidnapped woman. The story is nothing special, merely a template for lots of globe-trotting stylistics and plenty of well-directed action sequences.I notice this film has been panned by critics and audiences alike, but I feel puzzled and as if I saw a different movie. There's nothing majorly wrong with this movie. Sure, it's a little CGI heavy at times, but it has a lightness of touch that makes it a fun watch, and plenty of hard-hitting fight scenes that have great choreography. The opening fight, inspired by the likes of THE RAID 2, is by far the best part of the movie, and it never again quite reaches the same highs, but the rest is still engaging.Statham's kill missions are suspenseful and one of them has a jaw-dropping, laugh-out-loud denouement. Statham is his usual brooding presence and looks bad-ass with a beard, while Jessica Alba isn't too annoying. The villain is weak but Tommy Lee Jones has an amusing minor role as a quirky character. Best of the lot is Michelle Yeoh, underutilised yes, but it's still good to see her. MECHANIC: RESURRECTION is noisy and dumb, but also exciting and fast-paced. I really enjoyed it."
" Not as terrible as everyone says
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,7,"I don't know if it was down to a timing limit or whether the fast pace needed to be there throughout the film, but I have to agree with those who say its a bit unbelievable from a plot standpoint. I feel like the whole establishing of a relationship between Statham's character (Bishop) and Alba's (Gina) happens too quickly. They go from having a mutual problem to sleeping together to boy friend and girlfriend within minutes. If this was down to a timing restriction, then I do believe that it was dealt with fairly well and in an acceptable way. I do, however, wish that the relationship could have had more time in the beginning.From an action standpoint I think Statham excelled at fulfilling his wish to make it seem as if Bishop was working with his environment. Not once did I believe that someone of his skill set wouldn't be able to get out of the position he was in. The action aspect of the movie provides a lot of it, and it does bring one to the edge of their seat, even if there are no mishaps. So perhaps maybe a few should have been included, so that an audience member is left with a firm belief that nothing can go wrong. A little mishap would have increased the levels of suspense, like perhaps when vacuuming to the bottom of the pool Bishop slips up and one handle doesn't attach properly. Ultimately I enjoyed this movie and it provided a fairly decent story."
" Let this NOT Resurrect
",2017-06-03 00:00:00,5,"This is what happens when people do things exclusively for the money. Jason Stratham the star is a player in the movie industry and has made some impressive films based on his ability to make fighting look good. I remember him in an interview emphasizing how he is in it for the money or something to that affect and I thought nothing wrong with that as long as it is a win-win. He managed to hold my attention steadily until this movie. At first, I was intrigued expecting to see him do his thing but then I saw how he took his niche and just maxed it out as in more bang for the buck in a shoot it all up anything goes yahooooo I was disappointed.. Of course the viewers get the bang he gets the buck. It starts to get a little old when you get into the movie as we are asked to believe that anything he wants to do he does and mind you, he has no super powers either! That's taking it a bit too far but it manages to hold your attention until 2/3 into the movie where you might find yourself wishing he dies or the movie ends. In other words, overload on the premises of super-fighter never gets a scratch and always wins. I couldn't help think about Daniel Craig's James Bond who doesn't push it too far and he still needs luck to come out and not just movie magic even though you wonder but its done in a subtle way. The Bonds prior to that sort of got corny and comic bookish only because they couldn't do martial arts. Here, he does martial arts until you wonder how long can you keep this up? That's where the viewer gets tired and wants out. Perhaps Stratham wants out too but with all the movie money he can garner? How about leaving with class? Give us some fine performances, good story and memorable scenes so we can have fond thoughts of your career. You already have the money. Here's an idea. Time-out may help Jason here. He may get bored, want to do another flick and insist on quality or no deal. Lets hope so. Is this worth seeing? Yes only because he does do a nice fight scene but if he always wins against all odds without effort and never gets a scratch or can't be stopped, maybe he should start his own comic book. The woman in the movie doesn't capture your heart and I find it hard to believe it captures his on screen too. Story is weak and well enough said...See it so you can say ...Yes, I saw it. Popcorn will help here to keep you satisfied when the movie doesn't plus a tasty drink"
" Typical Jason Statham film
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,7,"The Mechanic: Resurrection is the sequel to the 2011 Mechanic cult hit film. The original was not as big of a box office success, though it received this sequel as a passion project for Statham, and having a cult-type fanbase. This film is the standard action Jason Statham film, and for fans of him, they know what to expect. Although this sequel isn't better than the 2011 version, it still gets the job done and delivers on action, suspense and thrills. A majority of the negative reviews seem to be from people who had too high expectations or were expecting something completely different. This isn't an Oscar contending film, it's a brainless action film with great stunts, a decent story and a beautiful scenery. Where it should be judged as one. Worth a watch."
" This was fun!
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed watching this movie. It was just a fun romp, nothing deep. Of course we know that the Mechanic, as portrayed by Jason Statham, is going to succeed in every mission/hit/assassination, but the fun is watching how he goes about it. And we get to see some beautiful locations, and beautiful actresses to go along for the ride. This is James Bond as a private assassin for hire, instead of the usual government employee, but with just as many gadgets. If you want to waste a couple hours watching mindless excitement, this one is for you!"
" Run of the Mill with a couple of moments to shine
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,4,"The premise isn't bad, even if it has been done before. A retired hit-man is coerced into returning to the job in order to save a special someone from an enemy from his past. The result is plenty of hard-hitting fist fights, gun battles and some interesting creative deaths. This is of course because the main character is supposed to make each death look like an accident.What this film does right is primarily in the choreographed fights. Hard knocks and some quick use of his fists, Jason Statham's physicality, already exhibited in many of his other films, is put to near constant use. The rest of the movie, however, is pretty rough around the edges.The story falls apart on several points as character's only motivation to behave as they do is to morbidly push the plot along, which is especially frustrating when deaths that are supposed to look like accidents are clearly murders. The motivations of characters are foggy at best, especially the impetuous relationship between Jason Statham and Jessica Alba's characters.In addition to the poorly conceived plot line, the effects department and production team failed to blend green screen stages, background sets and simple explosions in a convincing manner.Have a watch if you're looking for a quick action film with lots of people getting shot, large amounts of time dedicated to fruitless attacks that result in getting characters nowhere they want to be and lots of Jason Statham without his shirt on, punching people in the face."
" Could have been the next Bond movie!
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,10,"Great entertainment: Since our protagonist did not die in the first Mechanic movie (as opposed to the original 1972 classic with Charles Bronson), we are open to sequels. Good so. This could be the next Bond movie: Our Mechanic operates in spectacular environment, great vistas all along. He has seemingly unlimited financial reserves, and a plethora of gadgets. The villains are also formidable, equally well equipped, and like in a good Bond movie: They die a spectacular death, Mechanic gets the girl.Stunts are great, so are the fight scenes. Opening resembles almost the Moonraker! This is hands down the best action thriller of recent time. Please continue! And explain it to the new Bond crew how to make a good action entertainment, they lost their ways."
" Nothing New but Some Spectacular Explosions
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,9,"The usual plot, ingenious escapes, and explosions but nothing new in the way of plot. That doesn't make it dull, however.This time, Bishop, the most dangerous hit man in the world, is living in the South Seas, believing he's at last left his past behind. He's blackmailed into leaving ""retirement"" to do three kills...Of course he does it, with plenty of fisticuffs, acrobatic skills, and...oh yes...explosions.The most spectacular of the three concerns a cantilevered glass-bottomed swimming pool suspended off the side of a skyscraper.Really there's nothing new because we know Bishop's going to prevail. Watching him do it is the entertainment.The best part, aside from those explosions and hair-breadth escapes, is Tommy Lee Jones's cameo, late in the film, complete with two earrings and a millennium patch. His role is played devilishly but is too short. His on screen time was wasted since he was barely a threat.Entertaining and well-played, but so familiar Statham could've done it in his sleep. 9 out of 10 for the beautiful scenery and how Statham looks in a wet suit...and the swimming pool scene."
" lots of problems
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,4,"Assassin Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) has been living in Rio after faking his own death. He is approach by Crain's associates for a job to kill 3 men. He manages to escape and hide out in Thailand with Mei (Michelle Yeoh). They find Gina (Jessica Alba) being abused. After rescuing her, she is kidnapped by Crain and Bishop is forced to take the job. The last target is Max Adams (Tommy Lee Jones).The movie jumps around a lot which leaves the flow disjointed. The bigger problem is that the wrong character gets kidnapped. Despite her hotness and her sob story, Bishop doesn't really know Gina. Crain would hold more power by kidnapping Mei. On the other hand, Gina would be much more compelling as a constant companion especially after already showing some fighting skills. Her back story is also wrong with her previous run-in with Crain. In addition, the first target is completely wrong. It's too easy to kill somebody in a prison. Crain could have infiltrated or hired some of the guards to have him killed, accidentally or not. I do like the opening wild action sequences like a Fast & Furious copy but it's downhill from there."
" Rolling, Speed, ACTION!
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,4,"This shouldn't take long.Jason Statham is an experienced hit man. An evil doer kidnaps his girl friend, Jessica Alba, and demands that before she be returned Statham kill three extremely wealthy targets surrounded by armor and hundreds of armed body guards. Statham pulls it off with panache, except for the last target, Tommy Lee Jones, dressed like a medieval court jester and full of engaging wisecracks. With two down and one catch-and-release, Statham knocks off the kidnapping evil doer in the bargain. And for all of his impossible feats, not a drop of blood is drawn from Statham, who is in desperate need of a shave. A few years ago it wouldn't have been Statham in the lead, but Stallone, Schwarznegger, Willis, or Van Damme. It wouldn't have mattered.The number of shredded bodies must be up in the googles. No impossibility in their dispatch is spared. One falls through the bottom of a swimming pool that stretches out over the city streets from the penthouse of a Sidney skyscraper. Most are simply shot to death or blown to bits as Statham goes about his business in a black T-shirt that puts his cartoon-like muscles on display.Statham looks mean all the time. He tries to smile as he snuggles up with his girl friend at the end but we can almost hear the squeak of long-unused facial muscles. At the same time, it must be admitted that snuggling Jessica Alba is enough to make any man at least TRY to smile.You enjoy action movies? Then this is for you."
" No logical movie at all, full of stupid actions and things that just don't make sense
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,2,"Jason is falling deeply in love with a girl he just met and it comes the main purpose of his quiet and secret life to rescue this woman Thailand, Australia, Hungary...? Why? What was the reason? They're jumping from the place to another, diving with a single tank and cheap DPV, navigating underwater from Hungary to some tropical island? Jail island...w t f? most stupid scene I've ever seen. You feel stupid when you watch this, but when you forget that - just laugh and wait for the next cheap action in the movie. Tommy Lee Jones's high security submarine center, no one can enter and many people have tried and died, but they just drive in with a speedboat and it's empty.Dennis Gansel should change his profession, that's definitely not directing movies. Worst movie I've seen in a long time. Only positives are Jason's acting as a action hero and Jessica's ass. Her acting was like a soap opera, which this movie actually was."
" One of the worst films I have ever seen
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,2,"The film started decently, but rapidly begins to fall flat. I struggled to remain interested in anything that was going on during the film, way to many plot holes. I love the old 80's style of action films, this tried a miraculously fails at capturing what made those films so great. I would give it a 1/10, however I feel that rating is reserved for films that actually cause harm to you. Do not waste your time."
" Wh That looks appealing... living on a boat.

" Mechanic: Resurrection
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,5,"The first movie was a remake of the classic 1972 Charles Bronson thriller starring Jason Statham...and was reasonably acceptable to remake, I guess. Of course they then got carried away (as always happens) and thought it would be a good idea to make a sequel to said remake...of the original 1972 classic. Now everyone knows this would all end in tears and complete failure...accept the makers of this movie it seems. So once again we have yet another movie all about a super agent type bloke that is virtually invincible and that's about it. Bishop (Statham) is now living in Brazil after faking his death in the last movie. He is approached by some bad guys who work for another bad guy (Crain played by some bloke called Sam Hazeldine) who wants Bishop to kill three specific people. Bishop refuses, a fight breaks out, Bishop wins and escapes. Bishop is now living in Thailand (as you do) when he rescues a sexy blonde (Jessica Alba) from some drunk bloke. Turns out she has been blackmailed by Crain to meet up with Bishop and seduce him so Crain could then fake her kidnapping so he would carry out the hits. Well low and behold, in time, Bishop and Gina (Alba) do fall for each other and low and behold Crain's goons turn up and kidnap them both. Now Bishop must carry out the three hits to save his new girlfriend...zzzz.Seriously could this be anymore clichéd and predictable? Who wrote this? How did they even get paid for this unoriginal tripe?? How did this even get a green light for f*cks sake?! For starters this doesn't feel like an action flick, oh no, this feels more like a holiday destination video. The camera work is honesty stunning, Thailand, Rio, Sydney, Malaysia etc...all look beautiful, wonderful. If you're watching this on a good TV in 1080p, 2K, 4K or whatever, then these exotic locations will burst through your screen into your living room in bright, sharp, crisp, vivid colours. I lost all interest in the films plot and was more interested in the possibility of going to one of these places for my next holiday. What's more all the scenes on the beach in Thailand are enough to make you sick. The most perfect beaches you've ever seen in your live, the most perfect weather, and everyone in shot is tanned and beautiful (with the exception of Statham perhaps).What actually happens in the movie is of course ridiculous and crap, but that really shouldn't be any surprise. For Bishop's first hit he must infiltrate a prison in Malaysia, well get himself locked up. He does this by acting drunk and being a bit rude to a Malaysian cop. Apparently this is enough to get you banged up in this horrendous maximum security prison that looks like it holds the type of people that have eaten someone. All these hits have to look like accidents by the way, as you can guess this doesn't really seem to happen in my opinion. Pretty sure the first hit would look like someone strangled and suffocated the guy...because that's what he did.The second hit is what you see on the movies poster. It involves Bishop having to scale the outside of a skyscraper in order to break a glass bottom swimming pool that overhangs the building. In all honesty this is probably the best part of the movie because you see a lot of technical hit-man type jiggery-pokery as Bishop works out how to make it look like an accident, and then how he manages to scale the outside of the building. But Tom Cruise this ain't, its all greenscreen and CGI. Once again the hit goes without a flaw but I'm pretty sure the guy could have gotten out of the pool in time.In between all these Bishop does try to rescue Gina from Crain's super posh yacht out at sea. He locates the yacht, gets on-board and manages to wipe out a good number of faceless henchmen. Alas he is eventually caught, given a good slap with some verbal from Crain, and then sent on his merry way to carry out hit number three. So basically, this entire rescue sequence was completely and utterly pointless filler that didn't amount to anything.The last stage on this video game escapade sees Bishop going up against arms dealer Max Adams played by a very old Tommy Lee Jones. In order to make Jones look somewhat hip and trendy he wears bizarre clothing, some stupid coloured circular glasses and has some earrings. But because Jones is an A-list star they can't just have him killed off, so he teams up with Statham's Bishop to take on Crain. This naturally leads to the big final showdown on Crain's posh yacht where Bishop this time wipes out all of the faceless henchmen and (spoilers!) kills Crain. He does this without really breaking sweat or taking any injuries because he's got his invincibility cheat code switched on. You wanna see a one man army situation, well it doesn't get much more one man army than this crapola.I think you gotta be a hardcore Jason Statham fan for this one. Don't get me wrong I enjoy a good action flick and I've got nothing against Statham, but the man makes the same sh*t over and over and over again. He's becoming the new Steven Seagal but with bigger budget flicks. Every damn movie he makes he's either special forces, or an undercover super agent, or an ex-special forces/ex- military/ex-super cop or whatever, with super martial arts skills of course. I mean honesty, did the movie really need to take place in exotic locations across the globe? Or was that just the excuse to enable everyone to get a super extravagant holiday that's all paid for, plus you get a wage and you can call it 'work'.5/10"
" a crap that should have been flushed through toilet
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,1,"My Personal Rating - 2/10 - what a disappointing piece of crap, i didn't even finished watching it, the story doesn't make any sense, the acting is horrible, Jessica Alba's acting is horrible, the plot is horrible. EVERYTHING IS HORRIBLE! i can really see that this film just focuses on action and brainless explosions. and i can't live with that.it insults my intelligence! screw this film!."
" Just awful
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,4,"I usually like Jason Statham movies. And I liked the first one of these OK, but it was not as good as the original. But this was just terrible. Gave up after 30 min. The story was bad, the characters were totally unbelievable, yuk. I will go see the next Statham film with high hopes, but this one let me down."
" Great sequel
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,8,"Turns out that Bishop didn't die at the end of the first movie. Surprise, surprise. He's living the good life Brazil under a different name. But of course the bad guys catch up with him at a restaurant/bar. Their employer, Crain, wants Bishop to do three hits, but he's not interested and a thrilling scene ensues with him escaping.He ends up in Thailand were a friend helps him out. This friend sees a girl appear who shows signs of abuse and implores Bishop help the girl out who's on a ship off the coast. Bishop reluctantly agrees when they hear her screams. He gets on the boat and ends up killing the abusive husband and takes the girl to his place. He's a bit suspicious and for good reason. Crain did send the girl to track him down, but she's also doing it against her will. Soon enough Crain's thugs appear and grab the girl. Now Bishop has no choice but do the hits.The first is against an African arms dealer in a Malaysian jail. Bishop does his thing and makes it look like an accidental death. Next is an arms dealer in Australia living and working in his fancy high rise. Afterwards, and with the girl's help, Bishop decide to take on Crain but fails. So he does have to take out the third guy, some arms dealer living in a Bulgarian communist monument. And of course Bishop will have to find a way to rescue the girl and get rid of Crain whom he knows very well from his youth.It's good to see a sequel go way beyond the first movie. Mechanic aims and reaches the next level, taking it closer to Bourne/Bond level. There's the globalist globe-trotting that many movies aspire to these days. And we do get to see some cool sights in Brazil, Thailand, and Bulgaria. The intro scene is very thrilling, but things go downhill from there with the romance in Thailand and pick up again for the Australia mission. I would go so far as saying that we haven't seen this much Statham signature action since Transporter I. But Mechanic: Resurrection suffers from some odd dissonance in that it lacks a cohesive feel. Perhaps because for some reason there are 3 editors or because the second unit director ended up having a far too preponderant role in a heavy action movie. The villain isn't particularly evil. The story is of course nothing special but in telling the story we get tons of cool action and scenery. Mechanic: Resurrection is an excellent sequel and I hope it turns out to be franchise."
" Oh Dear God

" boring even for an action flick
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,3,"Having just watched Homefront which was pretty good IMHO, this was terrible. I wish I read the reviews here before watching. Felt like I was watching a modern version of a bad 80s film. I wonder if Stratham is slipping into ""Nicholas Cage"" territory with the ""paycheck"" films. Jessica Alba didn't bring much to this film. Just a big name.The movie did start off pretty good, then just sucked. The scenes leading up to the planning etc of each event (blueprints, sketches, etc) were ridiculous considering he only had 36hrs or something to get the job done. Who are these directors? Does anyone question what they are filming?"
" Contender for worst movie I've ever seen!
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,1,"This movie should not even be considered B grade because it's much worse than that. Tommy Lee Jones is looking for a easy pay day and Jessica Alba has never been much of an actress, Jason Statham tries to deliver but falls flat as well. The directing along with the poor and predictable script writing is utterly appalling. This combined with the standard of acting makes this movie almost unbearable.Has to be the worst Statham movie ever!I'm sure 90% of people who watched this film feel ripped off!Cannot believe that this movie grossed more than 3 times its budget!"
" Because it has Statham, Alba & Michelle Yeoh
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,7,"Judged on any measure of film acumen, Mechanic: Resurrection may garner a 3 or 4 stars out of 10. But because it has Statham*, Alba* & Michelle Yeo*? Thats three more stars + another star because it has Statham, Alba & Michell Yeoh. Just wanted to clarify my rating.In the vein of the Ringo Lam masterpiece the one with JCVD and the hot blond actress where he has a twin, but NOT Double Impact damn  MAXIMUM RISK!!! (always forget that one's name) While nowhere near as good as Maximum Risk, Mechanic: Resurrection has that same kind of feel. Excellent action scenes strung together with a love interest who is involved with the wrong people. Where as Maximum Risk maintains a consistent style and pace throughout every scene, Mechanic:Resurrection is comically bad in terms of writing, acting - really anything involving the story. Luckily the action scenes do sparkle, and have a really fun brutality. The action also escalates from the beginning to the last scene, which is nice - many half assed action movies place the best action scenes early or in the middle, when they really should follow this model of growing intensity throughout the movie.What should not be followed is the script written by someone who played a whole lot of Metal Gear Solid, Hit-man, or any of a number of stealth/tactical espionage video games. There is a really artificial feel to a great deal of this movie, and while I fully recommend video games borrow content from movies I'm not so sure going the other way around is such a good idea. I'm sure many people would find this movie unwatchable, but not meBecause it has Statham, Alba & Michelle Yeoh.It also has Tommy Lee Jones, but I won't hold that against the movie - 7 out of 10"
" By the numbers (1,2,3)
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,5,"Have you seen the other Mechanic? It was better no doubt about that, but if you liked that, you will probably enjoy this too. And while I still haven't seen the Charles Bronson Mechanic yet, I don't think this will take away anything or add anything to this movie experience. There also seems no way that Jessica Alba will end up being convincing in her acting abilities anytime soon. But she is pretty.Story doesn't make sense (did you expect it to make any?) and there would've been a lot of other ways to resolve certain things. But you have to leave those things aside, otherwise you won't have any fun at all. And fun is what the movie wants to bring. Doesn't really succeed fully in it, but I've seen worse movies. If you like Statham and some nice action set pieces you will be entertained to a degree"
" Good movie
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,Stop hating it's a good Jason movie. It's action pack and we'll what more do you guys want good movie overall and I went into the movie thinking I wasn't gonna like it. I like the plot in keeps you watching to see how his going to kill his next target. What else do you guys expect to get from a Jason movie he gives you an entertaining movie and that's why you still watch his movies. I think they should make a 3rd part for this movie I enjoyed it that much. Even tommy lee jones was good in the part he had. Jessica alba was good too and I thought she wasn't going to be good but she was I can't hate. Give it a chance it's a good movie and the way he kills his targets are interesting. Didn't think I was going to like this movie but I did and if you didn't like it then you guys expect to much from movies it's a solid action movie that is worth watching it's starts slow but then it does being action into it the further in gets into the plot.
" Statham's worst.
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,1,"This was so bad I feel compelled to comment. Wooden, clunky, contrived plot. Unbelievable, unrealistic romantic interest. Feigned chemistry. Insufficient motivation. Unsympathetic hero. Hapless, hopeless, utterly unbelievable henchmen. Total failure to suspend disbelief. Statham has lost sight of what makes him great: a challenging nemesis and situation that actually threatens him. The ""leverage"" the nemesis applies is ludicrous and completely undercuts any belief that Statham's character is who he is advertised to be.If his character applied one-tenth of the effort he made complying with the bad guy's demands to instead defeating the bad guy, the movie would have been over in 20 minutes."
