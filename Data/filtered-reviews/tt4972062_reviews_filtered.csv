" Not Terrible, But Hollow
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,4,"One great quality of the film is that the acting feels natural, actual people having actual conversations. But the actors are pretty much playing themselves. It's cheating, but still entertaining.Aside from one shallow trait (this one likes to draw, this one has rich parents, this one is Gillian Jacobs, etc.), the characters are the same person: Snarky, mopey, likes to mess with people, and appreciates the art of impov.Rants about growing old and how following your dreams can be a nightmare are sprinkled throughout the movie, but not in a painful way.I would value this movie more if I haven't seen so many indie comedies that talk about the same thing.Unless you're not tired of indie movies yet and you still like seeing your favorite indie comedy actors do stuff, you'll probably just shrug your shoulders."
" Poignant at times but where were the gags?
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,3,"Movies about fictional rock bands can sometimes be pretty hard work simply because the songs aren't good enough to capture the experience of being in a rock group on the rise. After all if they wer going to be hits they'd have made an album, not a film. Even a greast script like ""Almost Famous"" struggles when it comes to the actual music,
""Don't Think Twice"" demonstrates that it's even more critical for a movie about a comedy team trying to make their mark to have jokes that might actually make you laugh.
The well worn tale of one of the group (well two in this case) being fated for success while the rest submerge into bitter obscurity s at times witty and poignant but the comedy is never funny. That means you don't really feel they deserve to succeed for any reason beyond being a nice enough group, and that makes it hard to believe in or care very much about what's going on."
" Don't Think Twice to watch it!
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,7,"It was genuinely better than I expected. Cause although it is a story about an improv group, their own dynamics, struggles with their lives and careers are the main issues that are handled. It has its own taste of comedy as well. There is laughter emerging through their bad experiences as it is the same formula for their improv shows. It is admirable on that regard. Lastly, probably the standout scene for me is when, Keegan-Michael Key's character ""Jack"" did not participate in the one of shows due to his commitment to ""Weekend Live"" (Good shoutout to SNL), Gillian Jacobs's character ""Sam"" asks the audience if anyone had a bad day. Audience answers as, they probably had one regarding Jack's absence and the improv groups's comeback from there and getting a good reaction from audience. Great example, for how to bring out joy from each rough situation."
" don't watch twice
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,2,"It was really an uncomfortable expersiance watching this movie....maybe its just me
2 stars for good performance"
" Not for everyone
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,9,"For those of us who have experienced the beauty and pain of New York City while chasing impossible dreams this hits close to home. Improv and Comedy are by far the most Difficult paths to glory, as well as the most unforgiving. The moments of silent uncomfortably were very well executed by an extremely talented cast. Fact is, these movies are very hard to get produced, and harder to pull off."
" Blah blah blah...
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,1,"One of the most over-dialogued movies. Oh, and ZERO laughs. Watch something else."
" 100% Rotten Tomatoes?
",2019-12-04 00:00:00,7,"C'mon. Sometimes these reviewers have no idea. I thought this was good, but nothing spectacular. Key is a really funny guy, whether on his shows or in movies. He's definitely got something, but he can't go above and beyond with it. Or I haven't seen it.The movie is about an improv group, and their lives. One of the members gets cast on a popular TV show, and we see how all their lives are affected.The movie is cool in that it depicts how improv is. It seems pretty accurate. It's not very glamorous. It's kind of lowly, but still really cool.I thought it was good/okay. Good stories behind each character.7 stars"
" Enjoyed this movie so much!
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,10,"A great movie about friends bonded by improving their improv skills. Every friend doesn't succeed, the movie is a realistic look at how success and failure can effect the dynamics of this group of friends."
" my notes
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,4,"This movie had some funny parts, but mostly dry humor. it was more about the characters and their lives and emotions and feelings. this is not my kind of movie. i really don't have anything bad to say about it. it seems like a generally well-made movie. but i just didn't really like it.

" Don't waste your precious time
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,1,This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched. It's not a comedy not at all and drama? Yes it is terrible drama to watch.
" I'm being generous with 1
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,1,"I've rated many movies of the bad kind, but this one stole the cake enough for me to want to write my first review. As my first review I should mention i'm not a believer in critics or reviews by people I don't know, but seeing how so many gave this movie a 2 thumbs up just leaves me puzzled. The situation each character faved and the themes this movie were trying to set could have made for some great work. Sadly though the writing, and scenes were terribly placed together. We were supposed to be believing in each characters issues, each characters connection to one another, and I honestly can't say I felt any of the emotions they could have gone through. Jealousy, resentment, fear, bonds breaking, sense of growing into a more complete adult, and even the bonds the characters had between themselves felt dim. To have a dim candle sell us on all those emotions, does not work. To have a performance nuanced or downplayed is one thing, but to do it with the overall project, seems unfinished. To have a script, actors, and directing all fall short of selling the potential dramady this could have been is crazy. Given the talent behind the lens, on paper, and on screen you'd think they could havd forced out more than just a chuckle. Instead i'm left with a feeling in my gut that this movie was grossly overrated, and unfairly reviewed. I'm not saying this is what happened, but it feels as if every person attached to this project banded together and went incognito under a profile and said ""let's all hijack the reviews"". I'm a fan of indie, unconventional and arthouse type movies, but slapping any of those labels on this movie would be a huge slap in the face to any of those categories. This movie could have been so much better, and while i've given some movies with similar failings in directing, acting or writing, better ratings those movies still had subtle things such as cinematography, half-decent action, quirky side characters. This mess should apologize to the sum of its parts, because I did try to enjoy what little I could, sadly there was nothing left when I finished."
" Are Our Dreams Even Meant For Us?
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,10,"In 2016's mesmerizing Comedy-Drama 'Don't Think Twice', Writer-Director-Actor Mike Birbiglia asks us a very vital questions: Are Our Dreams Ready For Us? By ready I mean, are the dreamers going to accomplish their dreams or is just an imagination of their minds? For Birbiglia, its uncertain. And interestingly enough, Birbiglia has made a film that's nothing less a triumph in terms of storytelling.'Don't Think Twice' Synopsis: When a member of a popular New York City improv troupe gets a huge break, the rest of the group - all best friends - start to realize that not everyone is going to make it after all.'Don't Think Twice' is about dreams, dreamers & the part of destiny & luck doing its job. No one in this world is born without skill, courage or determination, and the characters here, an amusingly lovable improv troupe from NYC, are shown as dreamers with talent. But, as luck chooses its opportunists, only one of them, actually makes the cut. And its sad what happens here, but not all of it. Triumph in life is usually waived by the amount of money & fame you can make for yourself (not only in showbiz), but at times, when the dreams aren't materializing in reality, you look on the gift on looking at the gifts you have left: To Be You!Birbiglia is up for top-honors. 'Don't Think Twice' is a bitingly great film, whose nakedness on life & dreams, is of high-order. Birbiglia's Screenplay is super strong, while his Direction, is extremely arresting. The Cinematography & The Edit, merit a special mention.Performance-Wise: Birbiglia does well as an actor as well. Clearly, the man has excelled in all the roles he's put himself in! Keegan-Michael Key is nicely restrained. Gillian Jacobs is outstanding. She's at her best here! Kate Micucci, Tami Sagher and Chris Gethard, also deliver magnificently. Others lend excellent support.On the whole, 'Don't Think Twice' takes a piece out of you & stays in your mind long after it concludes. How many films do that? Don't Think, Just Watch It!"
" Adsolute Garbage
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,1,"From this point I'll no longer use ratings from ""reviewers"" here for making choices because it has become filled with Shills and LIARS.This is one of, if not THE, most boring piece of garbage that we've ever watched to be called a movie."
" Don't think twice about watching this
",2018-06-03 00:00:00,3,"The entire film can be summed up by one of the statements made about half way through this snooze fest. ""It's like when something sounds funny, but it isn't funny""."
" Think twice
",2018-03-27 00:00:00,6,"What supposedly was described as one of the best comedies of that year, ""Don't Think Twice"" instead turned out to be an average drama.Fueled by Keegan-Michael Key's performance as a improv actor aspiring to become a regular cast member of a ""Saturday Night Live"" type of show, what felt that could have been his actual real life climb into the industry, the movie serves as a look behind the scenes at the relationship between actors and the disbandment of a tight group of friends.The premise of the movie is good, but at the end it does not feel fulfilled, lacking a conclusion."
" Funny AND insightful
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,9,"This movie was way more somber and insightful than I ever expected it to be. It also happened to be way more brilliant than I could have hoped for. And I'm not just saying that as a newly 40 year old former improv-er, either. This was a film that could have focused on just celebrity, but also touched on community and creation. More importantly, it touched on relationship without ever trying too hard. I loved every minute."
" Whose line is it anyway?
",2017-12-18 00:00:00,6,"Don't Think Twice is a thoughtful film but not really a funny comedy of a New York based improvisational troupe called The Commune whose members have to re-examine their goals when one of them has been recruited to a Saturday Night Live type show.Jack (Keegan-Michael Key) life begins to change as he needs to keep his new television paymasters happy, he slowly retreats from his comedy pals some of them who are jealous of his success.Director/writer/actor Mike Birbiglia has written a love letter to improvisational comedy and the stage scenes were improvised. The actors who got training for this type of comedy perform it well but as with much improvisational comedy it never is that funny.The drama of one person's success on the others does make for a better drama and watch our for a Ben Stiller cameo."
" Funny and Hard Hitting All at Once,
",2017-10-25 00:00:00,10,"Don't Think Twice is a terrific movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast that can shine in both dramatic and comedic moments. It is a hard hitting film that is quite blunt about the entertainment industry, chronicling the lives of a group of improv comedians who become stuck in a turmoil when one of their members land a big gig. It emphasises the feeling of jealousy in a very accurate way that anyone involved in this world will be ashamed to admit how relatable it truly is.I did find that a few characters were left feeling like they were not established enough, and I felt there could have been more room made for them to develop. While I do love all the characters, I was left feeling like I could have learned so much more about Allison and Lindsay, both portrayed very well by their respective actresses, but not given enough time to shine. The cast is all around amazing, the fact that they are real life comedians really adds to it, feeling like there's hardly any acting going on at all. Keegan-Michael Key is richer than he's ever been, playing a very grounded character, with stellar on screen chemistry between himself and Gillian Jacobs. Huge credit also goes to writer/director Mike Birbiglia, who also plays a very human character, and Chris Gethard plays a role we can not help but emphathise with. Both hilarious and emotional. Had me laughing out loud and shedding tears, Don't Think Twice is certainly not to be missed for fans of comedy dramas. A group of comedians start to contemplate their life decisions when one of their friends lands a huge gig. Best Performance: Keegan-Michael Key"
" The truth hurts
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,7,"A mumblecore-style comedy drama about dealing with the success of your peers while you struggle on. This is a distinctly thirtysomething dilemma, where your youth is already lagging behind you but you haven't quite given up on trying to attain the ideal life you want for yourself.As with any kind of mumblecore movie - where the focus is on characters interacting in seemingly improvised scenes and creating natural conversational rhythms - it has a triviality to the whole experience as it tries to mine something profound from relatively insubstantial material. Yet somehow, 'Don't Think Twice' does resonate beyond its small cinematic ambitions because all the characters of the improv acting troupe are likable people and feel real in all of their insecurities and eccentricities, while also maintaining a funny and believable group dynamic. This is a character piece made up of selected moments with a thin but defined plot taking us through the various assortment of situations.Writer/director Mike Birbiglia has clearly allowed for his own cast to improvise through many of the scenes. Usually, films that are made up of scenes where actors go off-book to create their own moments end up feel meandering and indulgent - yes Paul Feig and Judd Apatow I'm talking about you two cufflinks - but due to the subject matter at play, it not only makes complete sense for this particular film but it also helps to make Birbiglia's disjointed drop-in/drop-out narrative-style all the more involving.It's a must-see for anyone who works in the arts, in whatever capacity, but it might also appeal to anyone who has ever seen fracture lines appear in their friendship groups as a result of growing up and growing apart. There's an insightful honesty at play here and when it's not plucking on those painful chords of truth, it's just a charming and absorbing story about friendship, failure and success."
" A Beautiful Portrait of the NY Struggling Artist
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,10,"If it has a fault, it is that it is such a beautiful tragedy that it is hard to see it as a comedy. There are some good improv scenes, interspersed with the group's struggles with fame and ambition and how hard it is to be an artist, which are so engrossing and real that your heart really goes out to the characters."
" Beautiful movie
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,8,"Did the people who scored this low even see the same movie I did? This is a fantastic, lovely, bittersweet, heartwarming and charming indie film about friendship, love, and improv. It's directed by Mike Bribiglia and produced by Ira Glass, with some fantastic talented actors in front of the camera. I highly recommend, if you're reading this, that you see it!"
" Good for a quiet evening
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,6,"This is amusing and has a few moments, but no laugh out loud moments during this film.The story is of a comedy cast trying to make it in the competitive New York market.It does digress and veers off track – sometimes becoming overly melodramatic. There's a love relationship, one of the cast has a dying father, another meets up with a high school sweet-heart who is pregnant. If it would have stuck to the nightly comedy routine and the tensions within the group it would have been more unified. So after awhile what exactly are we left watching? Never felt very engaged by any of the characters.The ending is overly schmaltzy with all participating in a group hug, but in the prior scenes there were fierce and combative arguments...Good for a quiet weekday evening."
" hilarious and heartfelt; among the most beautiful films released in the last decade
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,8,"Having seen his stand up special ""My Girlfriend's Boyfriend"", it has remained obvious that Mike Birbiglia is not only one of the best comedians working today, but also one of the most creative and brilliant. With his second feature film, Birbiglia absolutely stuns by emotionally portraying the hard times befalling upon an improv group when one of its members get a job on THE most popular sketch show in town. Portrayed with poignancy, humor, and intensity, ""Don't Think Twice"" is a strongly sincere and powerful work of art, combining tones of realistic melodrama and witty comedy. The central improv group is portrayed as a talented, hilarious, yet deeply flawed bunch that sail through life with both laughter and tears. Obviously personal at heart, and brilliantly written from start to finish, the film presents the weaknesses of its characters in a way that easily allows the viewer to sympathize and root for them. There are no good or bad guys, despite the extreme conflicts scattered about this indie masterpiece. I would have to recommend this breathtaking dramedy mostly to fans of comedy. While I believe that a vast majority of viewers will fall in love with the film due to its likability, entertainment value, sharp sense of wit, and practically flawless writing, its main audience is most certainly those who appreciate the art of making others laugh. This is a film made primarily by, and for, comedians, as well as those who actively participate (and struggle to make it big) in any other creative art forms. Aspiring authors, artists, filmmakers, etc. may not have ever joined an improv group, but will still likely find within the film's often broken, yet still strong characters much to relate to. This is a brilliant and funny work of heart that dedicates itself to the hardships of artists. It tips its hat at the often misunderstood art of skillful comedy, portraying the struggles an independent, yet extremely skilled comedian must go through in order to ""make it big"". Through smiles and frowns, Birbiglia weaves together a heart poundingly dramatic saga of love, loss, and laughter."
" Pretty good drama, but cringey improv. Not funny, but not bad.
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,6,"Hi film makers. Here a free tip. Never make movies about people that are supposed to be funny, and then show what is supposed to be funny. No actor ever, ever ever ever, manages to make that not cringe worthy. They come close here, but maybe as close as anyone ever will be. Here the thing: We see a lot of improv comedy, and it is supposed to be funny, and the audience is laughing because it's funny. (in other words, we are told that is funny or not) Here's the problem: we get to see what the audience is seeing and it's NOT funny. That really takes me out of it. And even if it WERE funny, we would know it was probably scripted, and scripted improv, well that's not very funny. (I realize the improv scenes a probably a blend of script and not, any-who, it not funny)Let's say you made a movie about the worlds funniest joke. It would be a lot smarter to not show the actual joke and just let the mind wonder about it. As soon a you show the joke, well, it ruins it, because chances are it's not the funniest joke ever. See?OK. With that said! Most of the improv seems quite natural though, and the acting is good. I didn't find the movie very funny, but I think where it shines is in the drama. Because this movie has some pretty good, heart felt points about human behavior. It's got some tense scenes, and quite a few times it hits quite close to home. (At one time I was like: wow, that character is me. NOT gonna say who)I sort of wish they had solved the improv-thing in another way, by maybe not showing so much of it, or making it supposed to be cringey. I don't know. It's a sad movie, not really a feel good one, and that's good."
" Bittersweet Story of a Group of Friends Dealing With Sudden Fame
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* This movie centres around an improv comedy troupe named the Commune. The group is comprised of Jack (Keegan Michael-Key), Samantha (Gillian Jacobs), Miles (Mike Birbiglia), Lindsay (Tami Saghar)and Allison (Kate Micucci). They do their shows out of a theatre that's closing down. Admission for the shows are cheap but they seem to genuinely love what they do. Most of the members of the group have been at this awhile, they're all in their 30s and they're all hitting the point where they're wondering if they should move on. After a show, Jack and Samantha get a call to audition for Weekend Live (an alternative version of Saturday Night Live). Since they're in a relationship, they prepare for it together but when the big day comes, Jack kills his audition and Samantha panics and doesn't show up for hers. Jack gets the job and struggles to balance his new life and keep his relationships with his friends.This movie can be looked at two different ways because its a drama disguised as a comedy. What this movie gets right is the dramatic aspects. This is a grounded and sweet story and I was impressed that the movie maintained that sense of realism throughout. They drew realistic characters and when those characters came into conflict, it didn't feel forced and the fallout didn't stretch how believable the plot felt. Although these characters aren't always fun to follow (they're easy to like but Jack's ascension coupled with his friends failure brings out the worse in them) I liked them all to varying degrees. This movie is ultimately about the nature of friendship and change and it seemed like it rang pretty true in the end.My problem with this movie is that it reminds me a lot of the Adam Sandler & Seth Rogen movie Funny People. When I say that, I mean that this is a movie about comedians that isn't very funny. I could count the times that I laughed during this on one hand. So much of the humour is done through their skits and their improv shows and it feels like you're missing the context for the jokes. It's like constantly listening to in-jokes and not having been there to understand why they're funny. So they nail one part and miss on the other, in my opinion it could be worse.I don't have a ton of notes about the acting. I think that everyone performed well, it's interesting that comedians tend to be decent dramatic actors. They continue that tradition here, they sell what the movie needs them to sell and the cast is more than competent in their respective roles. I don't mean to diminish their work but this is more of an ensemble movie and they're collectively solid without many especially strong or weak performances in the bunch.I'm glad this movie got some critical acclaim but it never reached that next level for me. To me, this is ultimately a small movie that hits its mark. I'd heard lots of good stuff about Mike Birbiglia going in and I walked away impressed with his work. I feel like this movie could have been made by someone like the Duplass brothers and I mean that as a compliment. If you're interested in seeing this, I'd still recommend it but I would also recommend tempering expectations."
" Heartfelt, adorable, subtle comedy
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,9,"I was really excited about this movie (since it's produced by Ira Glass and has Chris Gethard and Mike Birbiglia on the cast). It didn't let me down. It won't be everyone's cup of tea since it's slow and nothing much really happens. But to me, it felt real and emotional and the acting was top notch. It's more of a drama than a comedy so go in expecting that. It's beautifully executed and it seemed like the cast really had a good time filming it. It's not a blockbuster but it's a small little movie that will warm your heart. I actually teared up a little bit towards the end. Give it a watch and support the awesome comedians in it."
" Beautiful human dramedy
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,10,"We meet an improv troupe called ""The Commune."" They are based in a small New York theater, perform nightly to a small crowd for $5 a ticket. Though they don't have much, and most work the odd job on the side, we know that this is their passion. They are best friends who stay in on weekends and dream of being cast on ""Weekend Live"" (an obvious play on Saturday Night Live, the ultimate goal of most comedians in their 30's). What this movie does so well is try to figure out what would happen if one of these friends actually hit it big. In a tight community of struggling actors, what would happen when it becomes apparent that not everyone is bound for stardom.DON'T THINK TWICE is about as good of a movie as I have seen all year. It's directed by Mike Birbiglia (who also has a costarring role as an improv instructor who just can't seem to catch a break in anything besides romance) and has all the makings of a classic exploration of the human condition. Keegan-Michael Key plays Jay (you may recognize him from MadTV, and I wonder if this at all echoes his rise to fame over the past decade), the most recognizable of the troupe and one who is known to break out a Barack Obama impression when talent scouts are nearby. He is one of the group, but secretly dreams of breaking away. While the other members of Commune feel safe amongst numbers, Jay knows there is much more he is capable of.Jay dates Samantha (Gillian Jacobs is absolutely incredible in this role), a quirky girl who is nearly the exact opposite of him. She is shy in front of large groups but performs improv with ease every night. Both her and Jay get asked to audition for Weekend Live (to the frustration of the rest of the cast) and yet on the day of her audition, she chickens out and decides that maybe it's not for her. Jay is cast on the spot following his audition. He tries to talk to her that night about what went wrong, and already we know that this relationship is doomed to fall apart.The ensemble cast is all around remarkable. In a group of six performers, each is fleshed out and given a soul. Allison is the tiny girl who dreams of publishing a graphic novel. Lindsay comes from wealth and yet still collects unemployment checks to save her from having to find a real job. Bill is arguably the funniest of the bunch, awkward with glasses, trying to cope with the fact that his father is near death.The fun with the movie comes from their performances on stage. Filmed hand-held and constantly circling the cast, comedy seeps through the screen as though we were watching the intimate comedy routine in person. We start to understand the ins and outs of improvisation, and yet this is in no way a movie about improv in general. It's an honest, timeless human drama that simply uses live television where a classic story might have just used a knife in the back.There is such heart in the story, in the characters, and by the end (as clichéd as it may sound) it really felt as though I was beginning to know these people in and out. As Jay becomes more famous, the audiences begin taking requests for him to play some of his TV characters (though he is now cast on TV, he still returns to the Commune to help his friends and perform more casually alongside them). The rest of the cast becomes frustrated while Jay just soaks his fame up. Eventually it builds to the point where they perform a skit in which Jay has finally died and they circle his coffin, remembering him for the airhead he was. Everything they say is true, and the audience laughs and laughs. Amidst the realization of failure, maybe the movie is trying to tell us that the best thing to do is just laugh. It seems to work."
" OK I'm going to stereotype...
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,2,"There is always someone out there that is going to say a certain movie is great simply because it has that ""artsy"" or ""independent"" feel to it, regardless if the movie is good or not. That is the only reason this movie can have the overly generous rating it has.I get that it's not a comedy, but shouldn't at least the few improv scenes they show be mildly funny? OK so I got over that I wasn't going to laugh at all during the movie, but then for a drama it was simply flat and boring. I never felt anything for the characters, even though the acting wasn't bad. The ""commune"" actors didn't seem to have a believable chemistry to where you really felt for them.I grasped that the movie wasn't really plot-driven and its intent was to show struggling actors and how they deal with things like selfishness, self doubt, compassion, etc., but I just found the presentation of it a big yawner."
" Well that was a mistake to watch
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,4,"I'm feeling generous today so I will give this movie a four stars rating. But that's because I'm generous. Because honestly when I watch a comedy I want to laugh and have fun a little bit. With Don't Think Twice I can count the times I laughed on both hands, or even on one hand. Actually I don't need hands at all because I didn't laugh once. And that, for being a comedy about improv is pretty sorry. Not sorry for me because in all modesty I think I have a great sense of humor, but sorry for the so-called comedians in this movie. They are everything but funny. I can't speak for Keegan-Michael Key because I'm naturally allergic to that guy. His jokes never made me laugh. When I used to watch The Planet's Funniest Animals it was clearly not for his two cents jokes but to see some funny animal videos. In Don't Think Twice all the other comedians have the same level of humor as him, and that is nonexistent. So I give it a four stars because of the drama. I'm not into drama, but that was the only positive thing about this movie."
" if you're looking for laughs, you will NOT find it here...
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,3,"you can call it a ""dark comedy"" at best, but it is NOT a funny movie, unless you have a very low standard for making you laugh. it's not a very interesting story, and unless you can relate to being in an improv group, you probably will not enjoy anything about this movie. I thought about shutting this off about 30 minutes in, and wish I would have, it didn't get better, it didn't get interesting, and definitely did NOT get funny...snooze-fest!, unless you can relate for some reason, just give it a pass...there is not a thing that will make you laugh..."
" 8/10
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"The Commune is a comedy improvisational that performs in a small theater in New York. With Jack (Keegan Michael-Key), one of the six friends on the group, being hired by a big time comedy TV show and their theater being sold away in a matter of four weeks, the Commune and all of its members start to realize that their lives might be changing in a way they don't like and can't control.Portraying the comedy scene intimately and bringing to life a varied cast of quirky and beautiful characters, ""Don't Think Twice"" is a heartfelt, touching comedy that combines laughter with a deep insight into creativity, a small indie film made with real passion behind it and with some remarkable craft in writing and directing to support it.Being a man of many talents definitely helped Mike Birbiglia in putting this film together and he shows it in many different ways. He just nails the feel of the group and its dynamics, he manages to really bring to life on screen 'The Commune' with all of its quirky individuals and the internal group relationships which make the film as funny and as interesting as it is.Many time during the film he manages to hold on performances and little moments and the cast emerges with small touches that make a whole scene worth the watch. The way in which jealously and conflict or peace between characters is hinted at with body postures, timing in the blocking or the orchestration of eye movement is majestic, these are all small details that are the difference between great and good scenes and this film has many great ones.The improv performances are incredibly vital to the structure of the film and they are gold mines of visual storytelling. So much of how the characters move or what they do manages to build their archs and complement the story, most amazing of all is that even with that they still manage to be funny performances that really sell the artistic medium being portrayed. So many times in movies there is an integral part of them that presents a world of craftsmanship and so many times that world is not given a dignified portrayal or at least one that presents the medium in a convincing and clear way to the audience.Well, that's not the case here, you manage to really participate into the art the characters are involved in, everything about it is genuine and the world around is built beautifully. More than that you manage to directly see the impact of the art on these characters' lives and how it affects differently each one of them.The discussion that this film opens on creativity and artistic fulfillment is really special, it isn't glamorous or sugar coated, it doesn't ask questions without giving answers and most of all it doesn't fall into clichés. Everything it brings up about it is right, honest and moving. It is truthful to every individual presented in the film, all of them have the pay off they deserve and what ultimately this film says is that it does not matter how successful you are in something, what matters is your happiness in doing that.The cast is magic, they succeed in bringing to life this group in a genuinely likable way, you fall in love with all of them and it takes not even ten minutes of the film for you to be able to distinguish them all in their look and their characteristics, that is something insanely rare to find in features and this one does excels in it. Kate Micucci was a stand out for me, her casting is perfectly on point, yet, even more than her Gillian Jacobs gave a powerhouse of a performance. I think that not many people are yet familiar with her, but in a few years we'll be all talking about her talent. After 'Love' and this she has put out in a single year two of my favorite performances of the year. She manages to live her character entirely on screen, other than all of the comedic stuff that she pulls off she also sells the dramatic side and brings to the screen probably the most interesting character.The camera-work and the editing are both remarkable too. Firstly, the camera manages to capture some really intimate moments with incredible simplicity but effectiveness, it might be that the performers are so good on screen, but by keeping the camera movement simple and complementary to the story we manage to get moments of really big emotional scope. Then we have the editor putting this together so fluently, paced with relentless flow and with really smart choices on when to cut a scene or a montage.Overall what this film partially lacks is a stronger dramatic heart. Whilst tonally it manages to be seamless thanks to really good plot development, it does not have a climactic turn of events that manages to make the viewer captivated by the turn out. It could be said that the film does not need that kind of structure, but I felt that it might have done with some more development in the dramatic side since the pay off on that note doesn't really hit you as hard as it could.But that's enough meandering on flaws, ""Don't Think Twice"" is a glorious dramatic comedy with one of the best ensembles and combinations of characters to actors I have seen all year, a genuine and touching message for all artists and creatives out there, a really special gem of the indie world and a fantastic underground film on the New York comedy scene."
" Great, realistic and wrongfully overlooked comedy with relatable themes.
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,7,"Don't think twice follows the lives of a group of actors playing in an improv group in New York City. They're not just colleagues, but have formed a friendship and together, sitting on and around the same couch they watch Weekend Live (read Saturday Night Live) and hope to one day become part of the talented pool of people working on the TV show. When one member of the group gets picked up by Weekend Live, the groups' friendship is put at the test.Trying to make it is the central theme of this movie. Writer, director and actor Mike Birbiglia successfully depicts the motivation behind this inner desire to make it in the comedy business, which helps you understand why some feelings of jealousy arise when that one person actually makes it. When the subject comes up, you can feel the tension in the air, you can feel that some friends simply don't grant this person his/her success. What makes this movie great is that we actually understand these feelings of jealousy. The other members aren't jealous for the sake of being jealous, they start to realize they might not make it after all, maybe they aren't good enough, they start to question their future.Throughout the entire movie, you feel like you're watching real people and not just characters. This is thanks to the great directing, writing and acting of the entire cast. The most interesting character was the one Birbiglia plays himself, Miles. He's an improv teacher and there are some great contradictions between his life and passion for improv. He has a routine life, comes back home with the same kind of girls, tells the same joke to each one of them and seems to be stuck in his routine. There's everything but improvisation in his life. Watching his character develop and handle his frustrations was an interesting aspect of the movie. Birbiglia's talent as a writer becomes again very clear in a scene near the end of the movie, between Jack and Samantha (Keegan- Michael Key and Gillian Jacobs), that has a lot of emotional power and contains some clever double meaning. Unfortunately, there are also some flatter characters that didn't add much to the movie. Some dialogues and scenes didn't build the character they intended to do. Also, the ending of the movie worked, made sense, but somehow felt too easyNevertheless, 'Don't Think Twice' is a wrongfully overlooked movie because it's so relatable to anyone with a dream. Making it isn't a given and realizing it might as well never happen can be devastating. On the other hand, as one character shows, some people don't have to make it to be happy."
