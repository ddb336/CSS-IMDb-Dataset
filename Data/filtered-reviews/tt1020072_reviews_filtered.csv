" Essential viewing
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,8,"Ava DuVernay has to be congratulated on making such a visceral and enraging piece of cinema. This was to be expected given the context of the film, and there is no shying away from the horror of the events surrounding the march in Selma. The displays of violence are never gratuitous and always serve a purpose to powerfully deliver the films message and to accurately represent the events that unfolded.We are treated to a fantastic leading performance by David Oyelowo, who had so much gravitas in this role. His speeches were captivating, really capturing the essence of King himself. The fantastic performances keep on coming, with not a single member of the supporting cast falling short in any respect.I loved how Selma had a dual focus on the macro and micro events surrounding this march. We were allowed to delve into personal motivations and stories as well as getting a sense of the impact of this march on the wider US civil right movement. The focus is very much on the march however, which it portrays in a highly accomplished fashion.There are a few flaws with the film. We didn't really explore King in quite as much detail as I would have liked, and at times the film felt a bit choppy in its transitions, but none of this really matters. You will finish this film feeling hurt and wounded by the absolute lack of humanity displayed only a short time ago in our history. A lack of humanity that is still embedded in many parts of society today. It is an infuriating and heartbreaking film to watch, and is a truly moving piece of cinema.Selma is unwavering and powerful from start to finish. It may not be the most technically solid film, but it will be sure to leave a lasting impression."
" A film that should be shown in schools
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,8,"Selma has the distinction of being really the first Martin Luther King Jr. film. Released in 2014 to coincide with the then upcoming 50th anniversary of the events depicted in this film. The film itself had a budget of $20 million and made back over three times that amount. The film was a critical success and even managed to win some awards in the musical department. The film stars David Oyelowo as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.The film follows the events leading up to the March from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama to help protest the fact that black people are being kept from voting.I am not very good when it comes to talking about biographical films, but I will try my best here. First of all, this is a good film. I think the whole message is important and something that should be talked about and even have a movie made about. It is about time that a movie was made for this film. The acting is great with David Oyelowo giving a great performance of Dr. King to the point that I actually believed it was Dr. King himself. Acting: phenomenal. The events depicted are important in history and really dark and can be uncomfortable to watch for some. The music is really good and rightfully deserved an award for best music. Cinematography and direction is really phenomenal. There are a couple things I have a problems with though. First, is the pace. This is a slow slow slow slow film and if your attention is not 100 percent there, you won't be 100% into the film. There are not specific scenes that this occurs but more so just happens throughout the film. Another complaint being that I think the film would be better had it had focus on other people and not largely focused on Dr. King. Yes, Dr. King is important but so were a lot of the other people in this film as well. The whole film is centered around the events in Selma and not just specifically Dr. King. Lastly, there has been some criticism around the portrayal of the President in this film. I was not alive during this time, but if it takes someone who actually lived those events to say that the portrayal of the president in this film was not right, then I got dock some points. Sorry for being such a snobish film pundit.........Selma is an important film albeit with a few flaws. Definitely a film that should be shown in schools in say, History class or something."
" About more than just MLK Jr.
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,6,"I thought I would like Selma more than I did. I should admit that my American history is quite poor so I don't know as much as Martin Luther King Jr. as I should, and I knew almost nothing about his time in Selma, AL. I felt that the film focused a little too heavily on the violence that occurred in Selma than the peaceful protest or even the march that eventually ended in Alabama's capitol. I want to make it exceedingly clear that I understand that violence occurred and that I'm grateful it was not forgotten, but I felt the slow-mo clubbing of protestors was bordering on gratuitous. I also was not capable of fully appreciating the religious aspect of the film and the speeches paraphrased from Dr. King from my own background. I give Selma a 6/10."
" Where's This Film's Oscar?
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,9,"A story that not only needs shared, but taught in the form as education - so that all generations are familiar with the stand taken against racism and the greatest civil rights movement lead by Dr Martin Luther King. David Oyelowo, Oprah Winfrey and Wendell Pierce portray the roles of innocent, fearing civilians attempting to peacefully demand equal rights, without conflict or violence. Director Ava DuVerny - a black women herself - wanted not to provide a documented spectacle but a moving story from the heart. She mentioned: ""I am not a historian. I am a storyteller"". In 1964, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) accepts his Nobel Peace Prize. Four black girls walking down stairs in the Birmingham, Alabama 16th Street Baptist Church are killed by a bomb set by the Ku Klux Klan. Annie Lee Cooper attempts to register to vote in Selma, Alabama but is prevented by the white registrar. King meets with Lyndon B. Johnson and asks for federal legislation to allow black citizens to register to vote unencumbered, but the president responds that, although he understands Dr. King's concerns, he has more important projects. King travels to Selma with Ralph Abernathy, Andrew Young, James Orange, and Diane Nash. James Bevel greets them, and other SCLC activists appear. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover tells Johnson that King is a problem, and suggests they disrupt his marriage. Coretta Scott King has concerns about her husband's upcoming work in Selma. King calls singer Mahalia Jackson to inspire him with a song. King, other SCLC leaders, and black Selma residents march to the registration office to register. After a confrontation in front of the courthouse, a shoving match occurs as the police go into the crowd. Cooper fights back, knocking Sheriff Jim Clark to the ground, leading to the arrest of Cooper, King, and others. Alabama Governor George Wallace speaks out against the movement. Coretta meets with Malcom X, who says he will drive whites to ally with King by advocating a more extreme position. Wallace and Al Lingo decide to use force at an upcoming night march in Marion, Alabama, using state troopers to assault the marchers. A group of protesters run into a restaurant to hide, but troopers rush in, beat and shoot Jimmie Lee Jackson. King and Bevel meet with Cager Lee, Jackson's grandfather, at the morgue. King speaks to ask people to continue to fight for their rights. King receives harassing phone calls with a recording of sexual activity implied to be him and another woman leading to an argument with Coretta; she knows it is a fabrication but the strain of constant death threats has taken its toll on her. King is criticised by members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC, pronounced ""snick"" in the film). As the Selma to Montgomery is about to begin, King talks to Young about cancelling it, but Young convinces King to persevere. The marchers, including John Lewis of SNCC, Hosea Williams of SCLC, and Selma activist Amelia Boynton, cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge and approach a line of state troopers who put on gas masks. The troopers order the marchers to turn back, and when the marchers hold their ground, the troopers attack with clubs, horses, tear gas, and other weapons. Lewis and Boynton are among those badly injured. The attack is shown on national television as the wounded are treated at Brown Chapel, the movement's headquarter church. Movement attorney Fred Gray asks federal Judge Frank Minis Johnson to let the march go forward. President Johnson demands that King and Wallace cease their activities, and sends John Doar to convince King to postpone the next march. White Americans, including Viola Liuzzo and James Reeb, arrive to join the second march. Marchers cross the bridge again and see the state troopers lined up, but the troopers turn aside to let them pass. King, after praying, turns around and leads the group away, and again comes under sharp criticism from SNCC activists. That evening, Reeb is beaten to death by a white mob on a street in Selma. Judge Johnson allows the march. President Johnson speaks before a Joint Session of Congress to ask for quick passage of a bill to eliminate restrictions on voting, praising the courage of the activists. The march on the highway to Montgomery takes place, and, when the marchers reach Montgomery, King delivers a speech on the steps of the State Capitol. Even today, the most advanced generation, sees mistreatment and cruelty towards black men and women. 'Selma's' accurate picture and heart-warming acting provides the perfect representation of Dr Martin Luther King's activism in the equal rights movement. David Oyelowo's performance is exquisite and bodes well with the overall masterpiece directed by Ava DuVerny. A moving, powerful and inspiring watch showing a historic march that changed lives forever."
" Selma on 4k ultra hd
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,9,I'm hoping the presence of two commentaries on this disc may be an indication that Netflix will do a deal with someone to put Ava du Vernay's 13th (currently available on Nf streaming) on BD now on upgrade Upscaled 4K and Dolby Vision coming soon on paramount pictures 4k ultra hd release August 2021
" A movie that should be part of a tradition to watch every MLK day
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,10,"In 1978, the tv biopic King came out with James Earl Jones as MLK Jr, and was released 10 years after he was fatally shot at the age of 39 5 years after his iconic speech and 4 years after the historic Selma march, which is shown at the end of Selma, a great movie that everyone can enjoy and teaches us a lesson. Released during the early years of Black Lives Matter and now more relevant than ever, this film has a terrific cast, good pacing, and a great soundtrack with the hit song Glory by John Legend at the end juxtaposed with footage from the past and current era. It has been a TV staple ever since it debuted on FX and FXM a few years ago, and is highly recommended for fans of historical events. Had MLK seen this movie he would have loved this take on the historic Selma march."
" Happy MLK's Day
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,7,"If you have time on Monday, definitely watch this film and contemplate what actually means equity and the work of MLK. (Back to the film without political interference) ""Selma"" discusses the protests led by Dr. King in 1965 for the right for African Americans' right to vote. Through several realistic tragedies, soul-stirring speeches, and historical collisions of principles, the audience immersively feels the helplessness experienced by minorities and the greatness of MLK himself as a person along with other protestors fighting for basic rights. Down side, the film's really slow-paced and the event is not as significant and relatable as other epical predicaments. In all, amazing performance, reflective events, substantial characters, a great work especially for MLK's Day."
" Very educational
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,7,It's a good movie everybody should be required to watch it one time while studying American history. Definitely more for educational purposes than for entertainment value
" ""This right here is the next great battle.""
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,7,"""Selma"" makes for an appropriate companion piece for the 2016 film ""LBJ"", or vice versa if you will, since this one came first. Interestingly, I thought Bryan Cranston and Anthony Mackie did a better job of portraying President Lyndon Baines Johnson and Martin Luther King respectively, both in presentation and appearance in ""LBJ"". Something seemed just a little bit off with Tom Wilkinson and David Oyelowo in this picture, and I admit I might have been influenced by seeing the other movie first. Comparable scenarios are presented in both pictures, with much emphasis on the relationship between the President and the revered civil rights leader. As always, the machinations among the various parties behind the scenes make for compelling viewing, though one might question the historical accuracy of those little moments exchanged by the country's leaders. Of course, the highlight of the story boils down to the face off between King's factions, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Non Violent Coordinating Committee, against the largely antagonistic and racist forces of the Southern state governors and legal authorities opposing the marchers. Seeing the attacks against the peaceful protesters on the Edmund Pettus Bridge was as disturbing as witnessing them on the TV news back in 1965, a tumultuous time that also saw the escalation of the War in Vietnam, thereby contributing to the stress of the LBJ presidency. For those who weren't around back in the Sixties, the actions of J. Edgar Hoover at the FBI and the offensive dialog of politicians like George Wallace and police colonel Al Lingo will certainly be an eye opener for present day viewers."
" Powerful biopic
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,8,"This is a powerful movie. Educational and very well made, this is a great movie."
" Excellent, just excellent
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,10,Selma is a masterpiece: Outstanding acting and direction merge with a moving story about struggles and hardhips of Black People. One of my favourite movies of all time.
" Great Lead Performance, Fantastic Score and Conflict, But Let Down By Cartoonish White People And Overbearing Emotional Manipulation
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,6,"Pros:
1. David Oyelowo (Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.) gives a fantastic performance.
2. The costume and set design are great and perfectly set the scene for the 1960's timeline.
3. The dark lighting and perpetual FBI wiretap updates help to create a constant sense of tension and unease.
4. The brilliant score matches and enhances the African-American spirit of self-belief and hope.
5. By and large, the conflict between the Civil Rights groups and those in positions of power is presented in a nuanced manner which adds depth and an increased sense of realism to the movie.Cons:
1. Some of the camera-work, especially in regards to the physical confrontations, is obnoxiously reliant upon shaky-cam.
2. President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) is falsely characterised as a weak coward, even though he was the opposite, and Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth) was presented as a white supremacist, despite the fact that he was just a segregationist.
3. The emotional manipulation, at times, is overbearing, especially with the illogical public execution of Jimmie Lee Jackson (LaKeith Stanfield).
4. Every white character that opposes desegregation is presented as a cartoonish racist. The actual conflict was, and still is, more complex than that."
" rich history,good actros, easy movie
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,5,"In 2020 with racist president and open voter suppression this victorious tone of the movie looks ironic at best. the rich history and the importance of the moment made choice of writer and director almost irrelevant. many hoped they will not add any artistic vision to this important moment in history and they mostly didnt.
so where is the movie here i ask? well we are on a the boarder of documentary that has overwhelming kumbaya with white generic writer flavor."
" A bit slow, but an important movie
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,9,I will agree that this movie is not filled with excitement but it's a story we all should see. It's extrmely well done and only feels more and more relevant as time goes on.
" Masterfully and beautifully crafted
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a masterpiece crafted in the hands of the reverent Ava Duvernay. Not to mention the phenomenal performances from each member of the cast. This film begins to almost lull you into a soft comfortable place and within moments shatters any comfort you might seek, for this is no place for comfort. And it is painfully poignant even 6 years gone from the film release date and near 55 years from the events depicted. A must watch for any person, at any age."
" Scorching
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,10,Seems like a great recreation of the events that liberated the african-american vote in Alabama and elsewhere in the US.
" A bit too much of the myth and not enough of the man...
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,6,"It's really important, I think, not to mistake criticism of this rather run-of-the-mill drama with the actual achievements of Dr. Martin Luther King. Any re-telling of his story to new audiences especially to those who have (or had) no experience of just how African American's were practically, if not so much politically, treated has got to serve as a reminder that what we take for granted, we lose - and, like so many other hard fought rights and freedoms we must all continue to value them and work to ensure nobody is ever discriminated against - for any reason... This film, however, is really nothing special. The dramatic elements are awkwardly speculative - particularly the alleged conversations between President Johnson and MLK; the cast lacked any ability to engender the charisma and fortitude of their real life counterparts; the dialogue is way too wordy, the scenes too busy - constant camera movement distracting from the message that the film is trying to reinforce and I'm sorry but Tom Wilkinson as LBJ is just a bad casting choice - indeed the whole FBI wire-tapping business is delivered in a way that seems oddly routine and un-sinister. It is difficult to put together a decent biopic of such a visionary man and not let it slide into an overly-appreciative mire of sentimental mediocrity - and Ava DuVernay was possibly just too close to the subject matter to be remotely objective. It is an at times a rousing, but mostly a pedestrian effort."
" Mediocre movie of an epic tale
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,4,It was a typical modern remake .....Way too many camera tricks way too much noise over the speeches ...Way too much moving camera. Just listen to the speeches and words. You dont need tricks.
" Politics of Historical Drama
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,7,"""Selma"" is a movie that seems will remain prominent in popular discourse on history and race for some time to come, at least if screenings of it continue to reappear every Martin Luther King Jr. Day and February during Black History Month, Paramount continues to stream it for free when racial issues are front-page news, or school teachers continue to look for something that seems both educational and a way to keep students quiet while they hardly do any work themselves. It's not as though there have been very many biopics of Martin Luther King Jr., either, or even historical pictures about the civil rights movement. As original and always timely as ""Selma"" may be in that regard, it otherwise seems similar to another political biopic, if not hagiography, ""Lincoln"" (2012). Both focus on historical figures who've reached saintly proportions in the American imagination, both for their leadership in struggles against racist legal systems, and both movies largely avoid the simplistic good-vs-evil plot of the hero squaring off against the baddie in favor of focusing on the internal politics of the movement, whether in working the votes to pass the 13th Amendment or, 100 years later, in organizing the Selma-to-Montgomery marches to raise the issue of the Voting Rights Act.With less focus on the likes of Alabama Governor George Wallace or Sheriff Jim Clark as evil obstacles to overcome, although that is still there on the margins, ""Selma,"" instead focuses on conflicts between King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference and John Lewis's branch of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, but most prominently and controversially, there's the picture's battle of wills between King and President Lyndon Johnson. I'm not a historical expert on the matter and so won't get into the weeds on how accurate the portrayal of LBJ is here or whether the filmmakers veered too far in their avoidance of white-savior tropes towards historical inaccuracy. Indeed, it seems odd to me that a president wouldn't be eager to pass a bill that guarantees voting rights to a constituency that reliably votes upwards of over 90% for their party, but, then, this was the same administration consumed by the Vietnam War, so perhaps his priorities were at least questionable. Regardless, there've since been a couple bland biopics on Johnson since, for those interested: ""All the Way"" and ""LBJ"" (both 2016).By focusing on the likes of King, Lewis and company, at least we get a greater sense of the grass-roots nature of the civil rights movement. One doesn't get the same view from privileging Washington, especially from a president whose FBI director was actively undermining the civil rights movement, including by attacking the marriage of the King family, as seen in ""Selma."" These were rights achieved by activists and civilians, by shocking TV coverage of demonstrations and calls to action from the likes of King to galvanize people of all races to support equality. So, while ""Selma"" does partly follow a great-man-narrative with its focus on King, the trajectory of progress is from the ground up. There's a reason King accepting the Nobel Peace Prize shares the picture's opening with the tragedy of the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing and the everyday discrimination of Annie Lee Cooper (although casting Oprah Winfrey in this part arguably undermines the focus on common people somewhat) being denied the right to vote.""Selma"" isn't perfect. Depicting the bombing in slow motion seems tactless. And the filmmakers don't entirely escape the pitfalls of the genre for grandstanding and speechifying even when characters aren't delivering speeches or in front of cameras. Nevertheless, David Oyelowo is outstanding as King--managing to appear forceful without being showy. The backstory of the internal politics behind the marches holds interest, and I like the inclusion of archival footage of the real event at the end. ""Selma"" is a palatable-enough treatment of historically significant events to be worthy of its prominence."
" Affecting movie with a strong focus on strategy
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,8,"This drama about MLK and the fight for voting rights in the south is notable for a few things. One is how well it establishes the stakes. Violence is a small part of the film but every violent moment is a gut punch that tells you how real and often indiscriminate the danger was. The forces of darkness gave no quarter.It also gets into the strategy. This is less MLK the inspirational leader than it is Martin the strategist. His strategy includes putting people in danger and playing hardball, and at times he shrinks from the necessity of what must be done, but you see how effective that strategy is. (Oddly the movie doesn't explain the strategy of a certain retreat, although I found an explanation online).While movies of real events often try and shrink participants into one or two, Selma isn't afraid to show how many people were a part of the movement. Many characters don't have much to do, but they're all in there, giving you a sense of a movement that's more than just one great man.At the same time, David Oyelowo is good at the thoughtful part of MLK but falls short on the charisma, failing to capture that preacher cadence and that soaring rhetoric. I appreciate the egalitarian view, but still, MLK was often electric and Oyelowo just doesn't have that electricity.Overall, this is an engrossing movie that offers a lot of historical information yet never falls into the educational-film trap of movie's like ""Lincoln."" It is effective both as history and drama. I recommend it for both."
" Excellent movie
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,8,This is excellent movie that does a great job of telling the story of this horrific period of time and the success King had leading peaceful protests to force change. The only part of the movie that could have been improved was the actor playing King was missing some of the power of speech and charisma that King had.
" A MUST SEE !!!
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,"Wow! Must see film about the great Martin Luther King, JR. and the importance of the march from Selma to Montgomery. David Oyelowo does an amazing job as the great MLK. If you watch this movie and aren't moved than I don't know what is wrong with you."
" Enlightening! Engaging!

Enlightening for a post civil rights Gen X!
Recent Black History month documentaries prepared me on the subject and for the graphic bridge scene (History Vault, Black Hx 2019).Rather than critique actors, accents, directors, producers...I'd rather speak to how the film affected me!It hurts to realize the risks, stakes, boldness and courage it took to fight for equality genetically vested to all humans by ""our"" Creator!!!I wish the idea of the written logs had been expounded. However, this film provoked shock, rage, fear, empathy...it accomplished its objective!"
" History
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,7,"It is so good to watch an interesting movie about the history, true history, how we thought and who changed our minds. The true hero of humanity is standing on front of us: Martin Luther King."

" Not much has changed in 50 years.
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,9,"A poignant film with a timely message, even if it did take a little bit to figure out what it was trying to tell people of our era.
What's really the most troubling aspect of this film is that, about 50 years later, not much has changed."
" Nicely directed
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,8,Very nice movie and good to watch for everyone due to historic facts
" Disappointing
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,3,This movie is overly long with repetitive dialogue which delivers the same message like a broken record. It missed the point it's trying so hard to make and I became bored with it. It's got good actors in it but even they couldn't save it. I think the story should and could be told in a much better way.
" Careful, artful but choked (pace and style-wise) by the facts of the true story
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,7,"Dr. Martin Luther King Jr infamously stood at the Lincoln memorial proclaiming ""I have a dream"" to over 250,000 people - but that's not what Selma is about.
The film charts a specific period in 1965, with the civil rights movement well underway and segregation now illegal in the United States, but violent opposition in the south blocking black Americans' right to vote.
King leads his peaceful army in an epic march from the town of Selma, through deepest darkest Klan country, to the courthouse in Montgomery, Alabama, to exercise their rights.
The event is credited as having forced President Lyndon B. Johnson to sign the Voting Rights Act - a portrayal under discussion for its authenticity, as Selma suggests Johnson was a road block to civil rights when historical fact shows otherwise.
The filmmakers couldn't have gotten away from the endless hushed conversations between government officials and various activists if they'd tried, but unlike most political dramas, these instances are well-placed fraught scenes breaking up the noise and violence of the main story.
King is understandably sanctified in this celebration of one of his most significant achievements but the film also places unexpected and artfully presented praise on the members of the press who put the story unfolding in Selma in front of the world's eyes, strengthening the movement to a tipping point, with the closing scene carefully honouring other lesser known heroes of civil rights."
" FLAT
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,4,"It would have been a good movie WITHOUT David Oleyowo trying to mime Martin Luther King so bad.
It ends up being boring as the main character is too slow.
Viewing the amazing cast which announces a great movie...you just get surprisingly bored."
" Good but could be better
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,8,"I love historical movies based on true stories and ""Selma"" is a good one.
However, some defects of scenario and dissarisfactory screening of cornerstones of the story (for instance; scenes of walking on the bridge needed wide shots) made movie fail to be a masterpiece."
" Thank you Dr. King!
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,9,"Amazing. Powerful. Emotional. Fantastic!
This movie made me tear up, gave me goosebumps, and angered me to no end. David Oyelowo gives the performance of a lifetime in portraying Dr. King. Everything about this movie should be cherished and shared with everyone. The courage of the men and women who are portrayed in this film is unbelievable! We are all better off because of them!"
" Stick to the Facts
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,5,"Selma is basically a good movie when it stays on track, it only deteriotes when its falls into revisionist history. The portrayal of LBJ during this period in the movie is erroneous. That is NOT my opinion, just listen the LBJ White House tapes and to the people who were there when this tragic event happen. This second point may seem trivial to some, but to me it is a huge error. There was no live TV coverage of the Selma march. The REAL coverage was shot by some very brave NBC cameraman on 16mm film. That film was sent to New York, and aired on NBS News the following. To say the nation was shocked after viewing that footage, is putting it mildly."
" TAKE A WALK WITH ME
",2019-05-31 00:00:00,10,"The film opens with Dr. Martin Luther King (David Oyelowo) receiving the Nobel Prize as a church explodes in Alabama. The rest of the film concerns the march from Selma to Montgomery and the work to pass the Voting Rights Act. It looks at the inner conflict of the planners, the trouble in the house of Dr. King, and King's communication with LBJ (Tom Wilkinson).Oprah settles for a minor role as Annie Lee Cooper after having been denied an Oscar nomination for ""The Butler."" The film as expected is inspirational and emotional with good performances. The film opens itself to criticism from the left as it shows that President Johnson wanted to wait until 1966 for the Voting Rights Act. However, the view in the film is what is basically reflected in his 1976 biography by Doris Kearns. The movie also has actual FBI notes appear on the screen, in case you think the event didn't happen. I found the appearance of the note interesting historically, but annoying and interfering for viewing the drama.While the acting was good, I didn't feel like I was watching King, LBJ, or George Wallace (Tim Roth). I don't think that they ""nailed it."" David Oyelowo reciting the speeches of MLK, while inspirational, failed to project as did Dr. King.Worth viewing. Historically better than an Oliver Stone film, but not as much fun to watch.Guide: 2 F-bombs. Audio recording of sex."
" A fine example of mediocrity with a splash of style
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,6,"Selma is by no means a great film, neither is it a terrible one. It is simply and unfortunately ""fine"". The visual flair of the film is apparent within it's opening scene, and is carried on throughout with masterful cinematography and a keen sense of dramatic and distinct lighting. Additionally, the acting is superb, with the lead performances (particularly that of David Oyelowo as MLK himself), greatly boosting the raw emotion of the film. However, the racial tension of the film is so by the book and one sided that the film comes off as a predictable rereading of a school book, without truly engaging the viewer with multiple perspectives. As a result the 'Villain' of the story, in the form of Tim Roth's George Wallace, is simply boring. Again, a fine film, just not one I care nor need to watch again.3 Stars"

" Selma Review
",2019-03-19 00:00:00,10,"¨Mr. President, Dr. King is here.¨
This movie is about the civil rights movement and the becoming of fighting for the rights of African Americans. The movement takes place in Selma. Were they lead the biggest march in history.This movie takes place in the 19600´s.This day also became known as ¨¨Bloody Sunday.¨The director of Selma is Ava DuVernay. Some main actors in this movie are Oprah Winfrey,David Oyelowo,Common,Stephan James, and more.

" Selma Review
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,9,Selma was a very good movie. It did a really good job of keeping the audience on the edge of their seat. I always wanted to see what was going to happen next. The plot of the story was very good. the plot of the story had lots of interesting parts where one did not know what was going to happen. I also enjoyed all the emotions that were taking place. The actors did a really good job of making the audience feel the pain that the African Americans had to go through. It also does a very good job of showing how far this country has come in its civil rights movement. the music also helped tie everything together and helped with the emotions of the movie. How they dressed in the movie was really good. One could tell how much the people where segregated by their clothing. The white people would dress very different form the African Americans.
" Beautifully Made
",2019-03-14 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie and have seen it many times. It is beautifully acted and the picture is beautiful as well. I love this movie because I have always been interested in learning about the civil rights movement. During my elementary years, we vaguely talked about civil rights, and so it wasn't until high school that I started learning more about the movement. It really interested me and this movie has helped me to learn even more and understand what went on and what is going on. It helped me to visualize it better.
This movie is about Martin Luther King Jr. and the civil rights movement that he led: a peaceful, non-violent one. It follows him as he and the others helping in this movement marched and petitioned for their rights, specifically in a city called Selma, in Alabama.
Like I said before, I've always been interested in the civil rights movement, but I haven't always been very educated about it. This movie helped to educate me on a few of the many events that happened during that time period. Nothing in this movie made me question its historical accuracy. It was interesting for me to see the different civil rights groups and how they interacted and did things differently.
This movie was directed by Ava DuVernay. I have not seen any of her other films, but she did an amazing job directing this one. Some of the main actors in this movie are David Oyelowo, Oprah Winfrey, Carmen Ejogo, Tom Wilkinson, and Stephan James among others. I have seen quite a few of these actors in other movies and think they are all great actors. They all did a phenomenal job in this film. My favorite part of this movie is when they are going on their second (I think it's their second?) march to the Edmund Pettus Bridge. They end up turning back and not finishing the march, but it's just really cool to see how united everyone is in a great cause.
I really love this movie. It is well filmed and well acted. I love the history it shares and uses to educate. I love the historical characters it portrays and I love the courage and conviction it shows in the film of everyone in that movement. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves history, especially civil rights history."
" Excellent Movie
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,9,"This movie is about the Civil Rights movement led by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. It perfectly illustrates the philosophy held by the civil rights leader advancing racial equality and promoting the enfranchisement of his people. This movie raised my awareness of the heavy racism experienced by these activists and their philosophy in contrast to Malcolm X's. Dr. King wanted to turn the other cheek, get the white people involved, and X wanted to fight back.
My favorite thing about this movie is the quality of the directing. Very good, would recommend this movie."
" People can really be so mean
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,10,"Selma was a really good movie. One really great scene was where ""Martin Luther King"" got the white colored people to help him in the march, then when they were granted entrance into Montgomery, he guided them back because he wanted them to do it all by themselves with no help. The plot of the movie was to show how bad discrimination was that they couldn't even cross over to the town over or whatever because it was pretty much like death for them if they did. I already knew that discrimination was bad. I didn't know it was as bad as they portrayed it in the movie though, maybe worse. But i did grow up watching videos of african americans being beat to death during their peaceful protests in my history classes every once in a while. The history part of the movie was interesting to me. Ava DuVernay is the director of this movie. The only other movie i've watched that she directed was ""A wrinkle in time"". Both Selma and A wrinkle in time are really good movie, and so different from one another. Having watched Selma and A wrinkle in time, ithink im going to have to start watching more movies directed by Ava.
I liked how the whole movie was portrayed. I liked how Martin Luther King wanted no violence at all because he just wanted to be peaceful and let things change naturally with the sympathy of others when watching the people from selma get beaten basically to death. I would have watched this movie on my own time if it came up while i was scrolling through my movie app looking for something to watch. I would 100% recommend this movie to my friends."
" great
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,10,"I found this movie to be very interesting, it deals with a very important time for human rights and the two playing Malcolm X and Martin Luther King do a wonderful job and really look the part. It doesn't hold back on showing the brutality of the stuff that went down back then, which makes you realize the strength those folks had"
" Selma
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,8,"My favorite scene from the movie is the protest at the end of the movie, it was a successful one. The movie showed the struggles people had to live with and how innocent people would get murdered just because of the color of their skin. This point in time was traumatizing. These innocent people who were american where getting treated poorly because of one thing and its the color of their skin. They even killed white people for standing up with Dr.King. The movie has a great story line and showed what these people went through, some scenes were a little bit much and showed the police and citizens killing these people. I have seen a few movies with some of the women that play in this movie. I think the people they chose to play these parts did really good. I liked the History shown through the film. I didn't enjoy the people getting treated like the way they did and the killings. I have seen this movie outside of school. I would if they wanted to see this point/part of history and time. The movie was way good, it was sad to see how they were treated but it showed how they overcame these problems."
" Mega OOF!
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,8,"A movie about Martin Luther King's march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, Selma is an inspiring movie full of twists and turns. It's rating of PG-13 is because of the violence that's shown and the language that's used. But it's based on real events that actually happened.Set in 1965-ish amid the height of the Civil Rights movement, Selma is an accurate portrayal of what happened during the time. The amount of violence shown in the film is definitely not for everyone as it gets really bad, but those things actually happened. A peaceful march turned violent because racist bigots got butthurt that a bunch of colored people were marching peacefully, obeying the laws of the road using the sidewalks and crosswalks, not impeding traffic or doing anything illegal. Nowhere in the constitution does it say that black people aren't allowed to assemble peacefully. They were using their Constitutional right the a peaceful protest, but stupid white people got offended. Nowadays if someone tries to peacefully protest using their constitutional rights for their rights, nobody tries to kill them. Except the stupid people that can't handle being wrong."
" True american hero
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,7,This movie takes place in the 1960s and is about the black civil rights movement that was led by Dr. Martin Luther King. His role in this movement was very important as he led to success. He used non violent and peaceful protests to get things done. I think this was the right decision because many people would think African Americans are dangerous and violent if they acted in a violent protest it wouldn't be as successful as it was. This part of history was very important and I am glad it happend back then so we can all be equal today. This movie did a very good job showing the hatred and disrespect that the black people were faced with everyday constantly being told they couldn't do certain things. Overall this movie was really good and is very powerful to see dr king lead a movement with such power and determination.
" This Film Is Strictly Business
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,8,This film shows what Martin Luther King Jr. and all the black people in America had to go through in this time period. It shows how bad the white people were back then. With this time period I had known some other things about America. I think this time period is a very interesting to learn about. The historical accuracy was pretty spot on in this movie. The director did a very good job at portraying how all these people acted back then in the 60's.Ava DuVernay was the director in this movie and she did a very good job making this movie. Some of the actors in this movie I had seen in other movies. The only bad thing I can really think about is that the movie is a little slow in the beginning and and takes time to get to the climax. I would recommend all peoples should see this movie.
" Selam
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,6,My favorite scene was when they went on their march and even though other people were being beat up they kept marching. I also liked that they always stood up for each other. In this movie the filmmaker is telling people to stand up for their right. They are also telling us to keep fighting even when things get hard. I knew that in this part of history people were fighting for what they though was right. This part of history is very interesting to me. Yes I have seen other movies from this part of history. I have not seen other movies by this director. I have not seen these actors in other movies. I do think these actors did very well over all. I liked that they kept fighting no matter what. I didnt like how brutal people were towards them. This is not a movie I would watch outside of school.
" Good movie for the feels
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,10,"Watching this portrayal of the past with Martin Luther King trying to help people with their rights is amazing. You can sympathize with the characters as it shows the brutality and discrimination of our past. Great movie, helps us see why we all try to help one another in this great wide world and not try to bring people down because of who they are."
" Great civil rights movie
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,9,This movie should be shown in history classes because it was accurate following Martin Luther King Jr and his peaceful protests towards civil rights. even after the events of this movie people kept fighting for civil rights.and eventually got it in the end.
" Very emotional movie
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,10,"I loved watching this movie, it really got me and I was able to connect with movie. One of the scenes that hit me hard was when they walked to the local court house, they were met with barricade of officers. they immediately went on their knees and put their hands behind their heads, but one of the elders struggled with this. So the sheriff decided to beat him because the man was being ""defiant"". This lead to a woman hitting the sheriff to get him to back off from the elderly man. It lead to total chaos and everyone getting hurt. That scene hit me really hard, because I can never understand that level of brutality. It was a great way to emotionally connect with the audience by making them feel empathetic for the characters, and being able to connect with them is really important to me. It helps me to ""become one"" with the movie."
" Very Sad.
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,8,"The director of Selma is Ava DuVernay, main characters are David Oyelowo (Dr.Martin Luther king, Jr.), Carmen Ejogo (Coretta Scott King), Tim Roth( George Wallace), Tom Wilkinson (President Lyndon B. Johnson). I really enjoyed this movie but it was really sad, its sad to see what they had to go to, all the violence and the criticism. But I really like how at the end of the day they get what they always wanted ,the right to vote. After all the beating and patience they were successful and it was all worth it, I like how they stayed together as a race, best part for me was when the white people joined for a stand, loved when they walked down the bridge well and united. This is a movie I would recommend to other people to watch, its a great movie."
" Selma (2014)
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,8,A good movie to highlight some of the hardships of African Americans in the 1960s. The movie showed the extent of some of the descrimination against African Americans and the violence that motivated Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in his quest for equality.
" Incredible, but somewhat disturbing
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,7,"It's very hard to make a new and fresh movie based around the Civil Rights Movement because of the sheer amount of movies that have been made on it.Luckily Selma pulls this off very well Oyelowo's portrayal of King is uncanny and really shows how much of a people mover he was. This movie was going for realism, and it achieved it at the expense of a casual watch. There is a few scenes that are really hard to watch, but makes it really good as a classroom movie.Overall I'm glad to have seen this movie and I would definitely recommend this to a friend, but I wouldn't be there to watch it with them, because I was a little to shook by this movie."
" Incredibly moving
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,10,"Selma is an incredibly moving drama. It has great performances from it's incredibly talented cast, especially David Oyelowo in the lead role and great direction from Ava DuVernay. An incredibly moving, powerful and relevant film with a truly incredible finale."
" Brilliant work by Duvernay
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,9,"The focus of this film is the 1965 march from Selma, Alabama to Montgomery, the state capital. The purpose of the march was to protest the lack of voting rights given to black citizens despite their legal right to vote. As Martin Luther King Jr. was one of the main protest leaders, the film also focuses on his personal life.David Oyelowo is a perfect choice for the role of King. He easily portrays the great leader's ability to deliver great speeches while he also shows genuine vulnerability in King's home life where his mission has obviously taken a toll on his marriage and family. Oyelowo gives a very well-rounded performance.Director Ava DuVernay has done a superb job of taking an important historical tale and turning it into a very moving drama. Whether it be the camera movements and editing during crowd scenes (some of which are violent) or the use of low lighting in interior scenes, the viewer is carried through this special story with wonderful technique.Regarding the violent scenes, DuVernay seems to know exactly how much is important to show and how much is enough. Those scenes are never in-your-face, gratuitous, or unnecessarily prolonged. Many other directors could learn from this principle.The conclusion is truly magical. While it does not pretend that the struggles ended (as recent events have shown), it takes a grand moment and turns it into the celebration and glory it truly deserves. As a testament to the great collective spirit of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement during one of the most inspiring decades in recent history, ""Selma"" moves the spirit in the best of ways. Truly exhilarating and inspiring.OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT: Directing by Ava DuVernay"
" Worth seeing but kind of blah execution on an important subject
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,5,"I found Selma surprisingly hard to get into and finish past about the first 30 minutes. I kept stopping and taking breaks until reaching the end. It's kind of unengaging, by-the-numbers, and doesn't draw you in like I hoped.The casting isn't quite right. Oyelowo doesn't seem to know how to pull off MLK's restraint and leave the drama for the words and the voice. Doesn't look like him. Doesn't sound like him. Doesn't act like him. Randy Quaid was also a better LBJ.Costumes were even a miss. Selma's re-imagined 60s mens suits have stupidly-high notches and/or Parisian lapels. Oliver Stone films had far more accurate clothes compared to this Hollywoodized version.My favorite aspect about Selma was probably the FBI stuff that, in my opinion, is never out of place to talk about."
" Beautiful and inspirational.
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,7,"Very well made and well acted. David Oyelowo did an amazing job of portraying Dr. King, especially given that he's not American himself."
" Dull
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,7,"I'm English but the casting of so many British actors in a movie that is so much a part of the American psyche is inexplicable. Added to which the movie is increbly dull. Martin Luther King was a hugely charismatic man; this movie portraits him as a rather dull figure. But ultimately, this is a well documented period of American history and this film attempted to replace that history with a rather emotive saccharine piece of storytelling."
" an important history lesson
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because the production team recreated one of the most important moments in American History when it comes to equal rights. The direction and screenplay are both really good. The camera crew used such incredible techniques such as the pan shot to make us the viewers feel like we really are a part of the 1965 heroic March. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Not for the ""easily offended""!....
",2018-10-23 00:00:00,8,"Given that ""Hollywood"" has put its own take (not 100% accurate) into this piece of history, if you believe that a dark skinned person is inferior to you - please do not watch this film. We all have the 1 God and this film does not pull any punches as to what it is actually about. A piece of History that perhaps America and elsewhere might wish to forget. It is engrossing, it does get emotional and you will see people being beaten and killed simply because of the colour of their skin and their wish to have a vote...I would strongly recommend everyone to watch this at least once with an open mind and heart and understand what a small number went thru in order to have a right to be accepted"
" aula!
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,8,"Em tempos sombrios, uma aula de História sempre cai bem."
" Brave Example
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,9,"The important thing about historical films is that they show us things that we may not have seen. The Selma march is a key part of Dr. King's legacy, and was instrumental in getting the Voting Rights Act passed, a law that stood untouched for nearly fifty years until its key enforcement clauses were knocked down by the Supreme Court.Director Ava DuVernay has successfully captured the mood of all parties directly affected by the stirrings happening in Selma. David Oyelowo gives a stirring performance as Dr. King, and Tom Wilkinson is quite capable as LBJ. It is easy to feel the reverberations when these two powerful, intelligent men clashed over when and how to give African Americans unimpeded access to the vote while people were beaten and murdered in the streets by angry rednecks.In a time now where protesting has become much more common, and the people of this country are divided over many issues, a film like this is deeply important, because it reminds us of just how we can come together and overcome the ingrained problems of this country to forge a better future. Segregation and racism was so rooted in the south then, and it is truly not that much better now, but intelligent people stood together, made plans, and stuck to their guns. It is a road map for all who wish to evoke social change in this country, and it is a remarkable achievement in film to give us such an unfiltered look into how it all went down.We've come a long way, but still have so far to go."
" A fantastic central performance powers this affecting piece.
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,8,"With a phenomenal lead performance from David Oyelowo, 'Selma (2014)' focuses upon a specific time and place within both the Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King, Jr.'s life. It's a period that isn't always focused upon but is desperately important in the history of this monumental campaign. It highlights its modern day relevance while shining a light on perhaps a slightly overlooked part of a massive chunk of the movement. The film itself is a moving and captivating one that manages to evoke the rising power of King's speeches through a fantastic script and a powerhouse central turn. It's a methodical and affecting piece that will invigorate you in a similar way that real events should have, able to move you with nothing but well-timed words. It makes for a powerful watch. 8/10"
" Painfully Slow
",2018-05-26 00:00:00,5,"David Oyelowo portrayal of Martin Luther King Jr is stiff and flat. David didn't quite capture Martin's mannerism merely a poor imitation. It doesn't help that the movie is incredibly slow and boring. I've seen a few actors attempt to emulate King, so far no one has done a better job of portraying King than actor Jeffrey Wright. If you havent seen the HBO movie Boycott I encourage you to watch it. Jeffrey is outstanding. Carmen Ejogo is an incredible actress and does a phenomenal performance of Coretta Scott King. She also plays Coretta in the HBO movie Boycott along with her husband Jeffrey."
" Soundtrack Only Sour Note
",2018-04-20 00:00:00,9,Magnificent re-telling of struggle for recognition of black voting rights. Incredibly it wasn't awarded an Oscar. Only real qualm is the soundtrack which is all over the place. Oyelowo's central performance holds everything together. Film doen't try to be over-ambitious with result that it isn't over-blown.
" America Was Never the Same After
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,1,"This honest film shows the struggles of King and his followers against a white majority rule in America. They fought to bring down that rule and this movie tells part of that story. Before the civil rights protests shed light on the issue, the US had a very high crime rate, with rapes and murders skyrocketing. King showed that by granting equal rights to everyone that a white majority would be happier and feel better doing the right thing. Right after President Johnson singed the act, crime went down, rapes stopped, except white males still attacked African American women without remorse, and society became a utopia of tolerance and diversity for those in the movement. Equal rights were given to all non whites, and white supremacy was broken. All because of this movement. Well done director, well done."
" ""If We're Not on the Voter Rolls, We Can""t be on the Juries, and so the Klansmen Go Free""
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,7,"The 15th Amendment to the Constitution guaranteeing all Americans the right to vote was ratified in 1870, and yet almost a century later (1965) when the events of ""Selma"" transpired, no more than 2% of African-American citizens were registered to vote in many deep-South counties. And as we see in the beginning of Selma, you practically had to memorize the U.S. Constitution to satisfy the county registrars, but that still might not be good enough. So, as depicted in this dramatically stirring film, Martin Luther King has to mobilize his marchers in Alabama and incur horrendous beatings from the Alabama troopers, and thereby dramatize the injustice of the voting impediments that are brought to bear on black Alabamans. This elicits the nation's political attention and white sympathy. All of this culminates in the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.The British actor, David Oyelowo, seems to be the reincarnation of ML King. He looks remarkably like him, and even sounds like him, even when he's portraying King's masterful oratory. In Selma, King's tactical shrewdness is depicted to great effect. He protected the safety of his followers, to the extent he could, but he realized that the Bull Connor's (Birmingham) and Sheriff Clark's (Selma) were, in a macabre sort of way, the best arguments for the 1960s civil rights movement. I wonder how long segregation would have persisted in the south with national television.There's a debate in all historically-themed films on how much scope to give to artistic / dramatic license and how much faithfulness a film should give to the historical record. I'm not a strict pedant on historical accuracy, and thus I acknowledge that films can appropriately push their dramatic momentum by slight or modest revisions in the historical record. But Selma goes too far in its unfairness to President Johnson. Sure, it makes for more dramatic tension to have an quasi-adversarial relationship between LBJ and King, but they were far more partners than adversaries. LBJ wanted a voting rights act as soon as the Democrats piled up huge Congressional majorities in the 1964 Goldwater election. Not a lot of things went right for LBJ in his 2nd term; let's at least give him some credit for working with King to get the voting rights law enacted.A final delicious moment that Selma reminds me of: in the special Alabama senatorial election in December of 2017, Doug Jones defeated the noxious Roy Moore largely with the votes of black Alabamans, especially black women, who had the voting power they sorely lacked in 1965."
" ""Selma"" explores the strategy of the Civil Rights movement and its mastermind
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,8,"No 20th century figure looms as large as Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and no film could possibly encapsulate who he was and what he did over the course of his short but powerful lifetime. But in ""Selma,"" director Ava DuVernay and writer Paul Webb find an ideal window of time through which to explore King's influence and not as a dreamer, but as a strategist. The film examines the chess moves that took place leading up to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a critical piece of legislation that removed many of the barriers keeping African-Americans away from the voting booth. In early 1965, King (David Oyelowo) arrives in Selma after being unable to convince President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) of making swift changes to protect the black right to vote. Knowing the only way he can make change is to double dow on peaceful protest and make more headlines in the news, he begins planning with members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and ultimately challenges Alabama Gov. George Wallace (Tim Roth), risking lives in order to get the federal government to act.Emotion layers every part of ""Selma,"" but Webb's script has a definitive focus on tactics and explores the political maneuvering behind affecting actual change. Today, we regard the Civil Rights Movement and King's methods as one of the most effective efforts to enact social and political change and ""Selma"" shows just how calculated - not impulsive - those methods were.At the same time, the film suggests King was riddled with doubt. The man we know to be resolute if not stubborn in his will was keenly aware of the consequences for his fellow man. Oyelowo's best work as King comes in emulating his incredible oratory skills rather than the behind-the-scenes moments, but he's compelling nonetheless and captures both the strong leadership and humanity of this legendary figure.Still, the film operates best when it explores King as strategist and the dynamics on both sides of the board trying to plot their next move. The little character moments with King and, for example, his wife, Coretta (Carmen Ejogo) don't hold as much weight or attention. On the other hand, the way King interacts with others in the movement, like the father of a young protester killed by Selma police, show King's pastoral nature and bring deep humanity to the story. Those moments, when human consequences converge with the top view of change-making are when ""Selma"" shines most. The film just needs more of them. DuVernay also seems like a director best suited with that kind of material. The actors carry the brunt of conveying all the dialogue-heavy gamesmanship scenes for her, but she does best with moments like in the beginning when Oprah's Annie Cooper goes to the courthouse and tries registering to vote. That scene is a mere microcosm of what's discussed in the film, but it stands out because we can relate to it and feel for the character. The analytical side and the emotional side of ""Selma"" seem a bit at odds with each other through most of the film, but when they come together, they make for the kind of cinematic moments you want from a prestige picture like this. ""Selma"" is also pretty good when one side clearly overtakes the other, but admittedly it makes for a less cohesive finished product. Nevertheless, the film honors the pivotal piece of history it portrays and the key figure at its center. ~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
" Powerful impact, at moments
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,8,"Selma starts off like a bio pic...before finally finding its groove in the little moments: a a diner, coroner's waiting area, a car ride. The movie captures just how many lives and conversations it took to create change. There are parts of the storytelling that are familiar (almost cliche), but the overall impact is powerful. It's a civil rights story told from the people that were oppressed and rose up."
" A struggle in microcosm
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,8,"The metaphorical march to justice is a slow one; but a significant step was taken on an actual march, from Selma to Montgomery in Alabama in 1965, when a public protest triggered action that finally allowed black Americans to vote, after many years in which they had been prevented from doing so. You could hardly go wrong in telling this story, a microcosm of the broader civil rights campaign: in this drama, you have many of the major figures in the wider battle: George Wallace, Malcolm X, Lyndon B. Johnson, and of course, the charismatic Martin Luther King, who naturally takes centre stage in this movie. He's quite well brought to life by David Olelowo, who certainly looks the part and acts it convincingly (though the film mostly elides his private life). Tom Wilkinson is slightly less successful as Johnson, a more generic politician than the larger-than-life figure who emerges from Robert Caro's biography. Even though the narrative is straightforward: a fierce and violent struggle, then the good guys win, there's still something very moving when the story reaches its conclusion. But in the age of 'Black Lives Matter' and the presidency of Donald Trump, maybe also shocking at how much still needs to be done."
" How King.Jr changed the world...
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,7,"Martin Luther King Jr., who is a black minister, calls for a vote rights of black people in Selma, Alabama. As he marches with black people collectively, the white attack violently black people. Resisting the white's violence, the black led by King Jr. expands civil rights movement to the whole America including the white and the President Lyndon Johnson. Every single person in the world knows that King Jr. is the greatest and the most influential hero who approaches the world to indiscrimination. This film is depicted in detail how he stirs up the world little by little. When he speaks out in public, he is just viewed as an eloquent and brave figure; however, the film tells us that King Jr. is at times afraid of resisting his antagonists. In addition, some of the core members of demonstration decide who should be in the very front in marching by scissors-paper-stone. If I were in this situation, I would hope not to be the one in front to death. They are of course fearful for their action, but they end up with overcoming the fear. I believe that their brave must be respected and admired profoundly."
" Great film to remember a brutal period and American hero
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,8,Selma does not disappoint and safely delivers its message. David Oyelowo is the spitting image of the great Martin Luther King Jr however he may not have portrayed him to the full extent. When actors take on monumental figures in history they have very big shoes to fill. Having said that he manages to pull of a nice tribute and likeness to Dr King. The supporting cast did a great job in carrying this film. The film excelled in showing the brutality towards many innocent African Americans and the inhumane behavior of law enforcement. However it felt a bit slow at times and did drag on. Some will argue how accurate the portrayal of LBJ was. Also accusations against MLK being unfaithful were never substantiated and the rumors do not match with the reality of those times. Perhaps this could have been excluded. This was a good film but it could have been a great film. The best part of the film was probably the montage of scenes at the end and actual footage shown from Selma. 7.8/10
" An Important Movie About Important Events
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,7,"David Oyelowo was brilliant as civil rights leader Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. That's a difficult role to play, because King is such an iconic figure to many, and especially because he is essentially a martyr for the cause, having been assassinated a couple of years after the events depicted in this film. But if Oyelowo was even remotely overwhelmed by playing King, he didn't show it. Instead, he captured King. His voice, his mannerisms, his passion. It was truly impressive - the best part of a movie that was generally very good, but at times a bit slow moving.But more than just featuring a great performance (Oyelowo should have been nominated for an Oscar, I might add) it's an important movie. In fact it's a sobering movie, because it's largely so accurate. It's sobering for me to realize that these events happened in my lifetime. This wasn't the distant past - this was the south of just 50 years ago where racism was a way of life and keeping blacks poor and disenfranchised - through the use of state sanctioned violence if necessary - was accepted political policy. The movie revolves around the struggle for black voting rights in Alabama. In theory, blacks had the right to vote, but in practice various methods were found to prevent them from registering. King and his associates take on the cause and try to organize a march from Selma to the state capital of Montgomery demanding voting rights for blacks - the first attempt at the march descending into sickening violence against the marchers by the authorities.In the course of showing the march being organized, there are a lot of points made. The political machinations are revealed and believable. Alabama Governor George Wallace was played by Tim Roth, and President Lyndon Johnson by Tom Wilkinson. Personally, I found Wilkinson difficult to accept as LBJ. To me he just didn't seem right in the part - but the movie makes the point that Johnson had to be pushed to propose the Voting Rights Act of 1965, when he would have preferred to do something less dramatic. The movie also isn't shy about hiding some of the divisions within the leadership of the civil rights movement itself. The movie also notes the prominent place of faith in the civil rights movement.It has a powerful beginning and ending - the beginning portraying the murder of four young black girls in the bombing of a church, and the movie closes with a gripping piece of music. I often don't bother with the closing credits of a movie, but I left them on to hear the song because I found it so moving.There were a few parts of this movie that failed to really capture me, and it did seem a little bit inconsistently paced. But it's an important movie portraying important events - and still quite relevant, given many of the concerns today about voter suppression laws which seem aimed largely at blacks, and recent incidents of police violence toward the African American community.

" If you are a civil rights movie fan this rates up there with fried green toms
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"Only reason I gave it 9 rather than 10 was that the filmography didn't allow ANY boring bits where you could pee or refresh your glass. Actually I give it a 10, should have been quicker on the pause between speech. Reminds me of all the civil rights movies I love Like ""Fried green tomatoes, (at the Whistle stop cafe,"" and The help. I only cry out of anger and frustration, (it is my fight or flee response), This one did not disappoint, and I'm not a weepy person. (also checkout Leon,the bit giving the plant roots WILL BREAK YOU). Ash x x x"
