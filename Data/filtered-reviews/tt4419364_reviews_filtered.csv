" Horrible film
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,1,"I read the film description and didn't realize it was an actual movie, or shorts as they actually are. I thought it was sort of a history of different holidays. I was completely wrong. This was the worst movie I have ever seen."
" Rubbish...wish I could say more
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,2,"Just shocked at how short and pointless all of the tales are. The presentation is great but the stories lack depth, detail and everything else you need to enjoy a story/movie/tale. Style over substance in almost every way. Wouldn't watch again and wouldn't recommend it for any reason.."
" An Anthology Of Awesome Short Holiday Themed Horror Vignettes.
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,8,"So this is an anthology of short horror vignettes- each of which are based on an annual holiday, in order, as they fall throughout the year...and every one is shot by a different director.It all begins with Valentine's Day, during which a nerdy girl from the swim team (who gets picked on by her teammates) falls in love with her coach. The hot popular girl puts her down for thinking she's good enough for him. So- after overhearing this- he gives her a Valentine's Day card as a nice gesture...only to trigger a deadly obsession...Next we have St. Patrick's Day, where we watch a young Pagan Goddess set up a single, young, teacher to be impregnated with a serpent...in a last bid attempt to repopulate Ireland with both snakes and Pagans...after the Christians had run them out...This is followed by Easter, during which Jesus is reborn as a deformed Easter Bunny-Human hybrid that manifests live chicks from the wounds in his palms. You don't want to know what happens if you are awake when he's around...For Mother's Day, a young woman- who gets pregnant every time she has sex (no matter what precautionary measures are taken)- is directed to a bizarre psychedelic fertility cult to help her stop getting pregnant. But they just kidnap her, to keep her drugged and forcibly impregnated...On Father's Day, a young woman is sent on a cryptic journey of self discovery- in search of her lost (and assumed to be dead) Father. But it's unclear whether this search is actually in her interest...or just a trap...The highlight of the whole thing is definitely Kevin Smith's contribution for Halloween. In this short, a California pimp lures girls to work as Camgirls, before exploiting them, both economically and sexually, until they start to stick up for themselves. And take back control of the situation...Seth Green stars in Christmas, as a cucked Father, who has been sent by his wife to retrieve the hot ticket toy of the season, for their son. When a man gets the last one right before him. He offers to pay the man a fair price for it. But he refuses to sell it to him...only to keel over from a heart attack in the parking lot. Now, a choice has to be made...help save the man, or seize the oppourtunity and take the toy. Will karma catch up with him? Probably not like you'd expect...To finish things off, New Years starts off with a man killing his girlfriend, so he can meet another woman who is a higher percentage match on the dating website he frequents. It can be scary how accurate those algorithms are...With the vignettes shot by the following directors: Kevin KÃ¶lsch & Dennis Widmyer; Gary Shore; Nicholas McCarthy; Sarah Adina Smith; Anthony Scott Burns; Kevin Smith, Scott Stewart; and Adam Egypt Mortimer...this film is a masterpiece of twisted cult cinema.Great writing, solid acting, and a gorgeous style (across the board) make this a Holiday horror you are not going to want to miss.8.5 out of 10."
" Pathetic
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,1,"There are bad movies and then there are BAD movies. This is one BAD movie. The stories are ridiculous and incomplete. It's as if they started filming and said Well, it's 5:00 so that's a wrap on this story! Do not waste your time. Seriously. The only semi-decent one was the Easter Bunny. But, I wanted to see a cute, pink fluffy Easter Bunny at the end, with the old, battle-scarred Bunny saying Yeah, kid. I looked like you once upon a time. Good luck to you. The rest of the stories are pure garbage with no coherent meanings."
" Last few segments were good
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,4,"The last three or so segments were well made and fairly well acted, but the first few were quite laughably awful! While overall an interesting concept, there is an inconsistency in quality."
" Wow
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,3,"This was a real disappointment, some good talent wasted on bad material... I gave it a 3 only because there were a few things that were interesting, the rest was Z movie schlock, do not recommend"
" Utter crap
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,2,"A friend recommended me this movie. Only made it till the end of ""mother's day"". This movie is so weird, and in a bad way. Like makes no sense and wasted my time. Not funny or scary, just dumb. Do not recommend to anyone."
" It was wierd
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,3,It was more like a school Project the stories we're wierd and boring
" Eight holidays get the horror treatment with nice results all around
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,8,"A handful of eight horror vignettes that all share a holiday theme.Valentine's Day - Pleasing Carrie rehash with a sympathetic protagonist portrayed well by Madeleine Coughlan and a great gruesome punchline.St. Patrick's Day - Extremely daft and darkly amusing. The creepy redhead girl hits the sinister spot, plus there are neat echoes of both Rosemary's Baby and The Wicker Man.Easter - Yikes! Talk about a deliciously sick and unsettling tale. The grotesque Bunny-Christ hybrid guy is the stuff of true nightmares.Mother's Day - Weird and kinky. Lots of hot naked babes, a loopy premise, and a gnarly climatic monster birth.Father's Day - Poignant and suspenseful in equal measure. Jocelin Donahue delivers a touching performance as a forlorn gal who gets a chance to be reunited with her dad who disappeared when she was a little girl. Plenty of nerve-wracking tension that builds to a shattering climax.Halloween - Three web-cam internet porn ladies turn the tables on their slimy pimp boss. Very funny in a sadistic sort of way.Christmas - Inspired virtual reality hook along with top acting by Seth Green and Clare Grant make this one a winner.New Year's - Black comedy delight. A slobby serial killer meets his match in the form of a loony woman (a lively turn by Lorenza Izzo-Jean) that he hooks up with off of an online dating service.Good ghoulish fun."
" Seriously a 5, NO WAY!! 6 terrible and 2 ok stories
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,2,"I have no idea how this could have 5 stars, I give out 7 and 8s like no bodys business and I give this a 2, Kevin Smith's short was the worst 1!! Valentines day and new years was ok maybe a 4 or 5 the rest were negatives!!! If you have to watch this then just watch the 1st and last one.trust me the others are less than terrible!!"
" Time to celebrate
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,6,After watching the Jesus Bunny you are gonna need some chocolate!Very enjoyable collection of short holiday themed stories. Each one offers a unique take on classic holiday experiences with some definite eyebrow raising moments and good times to be had.
" Good
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,7,I loved the one about valentine's day. I would have cut more than her heart out I would have gotten her friends also.
" Good in parts.
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,5,"This anthology of holiday horror films is much like the curate's egg, parts of it are good.
Let's start with the good:
Valentine's Day - a bullied school girl presents her teacher crush with the hacked out heart of her bully.
Halloween - three, young, internet porn 'stars' get torturous revenge on their douchebag, mysogynistic employee.
Christmas - A father steals the latest VR headset from a man having a heartattack. It then reveals this to his wife and reveals to him she killed her boss.
New Year's Eve - A murderer goes on a date with his next victim, but discovers he's chosen the wrong woman; she is a murderer too.
Now onto the bad:
St. Patrick's Day - Nine months after a one night stand, a woman gives birth to a giant snake that she bizzarely doesn't find horrifying.
Mother's Day - A woman is kidnaped by a 'fertility cult' and impregnated by a random man. Nine months later the baby is born, except it appears to be a fully grown adult.
Father's Day - A young woman follows long ago recorded directions from her estranged father, wandering randomly around a seaside resort, until she finds him in an armchair in a doorway. He appears to be from I Am Legend.
Easter - A young girl is afraid of the Easter Bunny breaking into her home, as well as the return of zombie Jesus. Waking up in the middle of the night, she encounters the freakish Easter Bunny Jesus, who forces her to take his place in doing whatever TF it is he does.
With all four of the poorly written stories, I was left asking WTF? What was the point of those stories? What were they trying to say? The Easter one was especially weird, with its Easter Bunny-Jesus hybrid that produced live chicks from the nail holes in his hands. Me thinks they were tyring too hard.
My advice? Skip over the bad stories I mentioned."
" Dreadful
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,1,The stories were a mess. The entire movie was all over the place. Unnecessary nudity (and it was pretty disgusting). Cringeworthy. I recommend watching this if you're just looking to watch a horrible movie ironically with a group off friends and laugh at it.
" Totally Sick!
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,1,Watch this movie not only waste your time but it will make u SiCK!! really SiCK!!!!
" I wish it's a 3 hours movie with more holidays! Christians, skip this.
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,7,"Maybe because I'm a Pagan and anti-christ, I found it funny and ironic every corners I turned (Mother's day is a bit predictable). JESUS was VERY SATISFYING. I can give a 10 only JUST for this one. Offensive as far as it goes (I can go further but damn it!), the way I like it. Next time, make fun of Buddha and Hindi gods, too. I'd like that very much. Keep them coming.Low cost? I love that. Why waste money on fancies? Big movies are rubbish most of the time for me. Never interested. Shallow enough to paddle in.Jesus! We love you.
Don't mind a bit of friendly firing!"
" It's horrible
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,1,"Horrible, just horrible... Omg... I am actually speechless..."
" Try not to kill yourself while watching it
",2020-02-28 00:00:00,1,Jesus bloody CHRIST. I just want to ask a question... WHO IS GOING TO GIVE ME MY 105 MINUTES BACK. Oh my lord please do yourself a favor and don't watch it
" some bad some okay
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,3,If you can get through the first few Holidays then you made it. The only ones worth watching are Christmas and New Years. Halloween is okay. The rest are bad and to gross.
" Stoner flick
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,4,You gotta be stoned to watch this it is so weird these shorts
" there are ideas - there is no script, the concept of the dark side of the holidays is not disclosed
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,2,"For a long time on our screens there was no horror movie almanac, this genre was mired in trash, and it seems that it is not possible for him to get to a decent level, gathering halls, and forcing him to talk about himself. It's all the more strange that suddenly in the Russian box office, which sometimes ""throws out"" eminent directors with these festival hits, a short film collection appears in the ""horror"" style, all the more so since the only name from the list of creators of the hodgepodge is about it can tell the viewer - this is Kevin Smith, who became famous thanks to the comedies Clerks and Dogma, never worked with horror, but gravitates to the fact that most viewers tend to call delirium (for this I love him, Tusk - a great movie!). In general, I thought that there probably wouldn't be any scary, but maybe I'd even laugh and look at the fresh ideas that are brought to the masses by unrecognized geniuses like Smith.Do you like holiday I personally hate it. It is difficult to endure so much hypocrisy in one day either we massively love women, then we congratulate veterans, remember the paratroopers or the resurrection of Christ, all this with a glass or bottle, with arrogance and gritted teeth, if you are the mistress of the house, standing all morning at the stove, and in your living room there are 100,500 relatives gathered for Christmas. It is no coincidence that the most suicides occur during the holidays - in the wake of an avalanche of congratulations, it is not surprising to feel like the most lonely person on earth if you received a congratulation only from a mobile operator. In general, the holidays are scary in and of themselves, and they attract the creators of eerie stories to themselves.Black Holiday is a movie album of eight short films, each of which tells about an event that happened or related to one of the American (and not so) holidays Valentine's Day, Easter, Christmas, New Year, Father's Day, Mother's Day, St. Patrick's Day and Halloween. Accordingly, 8 directors worked on the picture, giving quite different results, but at the same time they all have one global problem - they could not go beyond the concept idea at the scenario level. Roughly speaking, it is likely that the guys in the producer's office, sharing ideas about what their film will be about, told the idea in general terms, and no one ever asked them ""what then"", ""How did it end"". It is clear why this question is not asked for the scriptwriters of series designed for 6 seasons, by the end of the project no one even remembers how it all began, and in the beginning it does not even think what it will lead to, but when the filmmakers encounter such a problem 10-15 minutes of screen time is very, very bad."
" Don't waste your time
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,1,"To be honest, it is the worst movie I've seen so far."
" I never thought I would miss the office more.
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,3,"Trash.Often with these anthology movies you have no choice but to try and rate its segments individually because a range of quality. But here I can say this much about the whole thing:It's trash. Almost all the segments suffer from having a poor judgement of their own tone. A horror comedy is a viable concept and is meaningfully different from simply a dark or macabre comedy but they don't seem to know what they want to be. I feel I could almost take them seriously until they just become insultingly stupid and crudely made. They remind me of creepypastas. Some creepypastas are good but so many remind us that even movies we don't enjoy at least feel professionally written most of the time.For some reason they put the title card at the end of the short, not the beginning, they order the stories by chronology of the holiday in the year which was a mistake and the music is so generic and heavy handed, they actually use ""Carol of Bells"" twice in the Christmas one. I was holding out just in case there was that one really good one that I could recommend to people and help kick start this writer's career. But no.I was tempted to just brand the whole thing as just ""trash"" and be done with it but I want to make sure each of these writers knows what I think about their contributions should they ever read this review.Valentine's Day is like Carrie. Not either of the cool movies but the excruciating novel, except worse. Writing bully dialogue is hard because juvenile torment does seem so motiveless but it hurts to watch in the bad way and needed about ten times as much build up to really work. If you tell me ""it's meant as a dark comedy"" then it's a lame comedy with no joke beyond just being macabre. We do get a rather sympathetic performance from the coach though.St. Patrick's day. This was that special kind of insultingly bad. It's offensive in a way that over-sensitive parents can't fathom. It not only rips of Rosemary's Baby, it is monstrously unsubtle about itself and even mention's Roman Polanski's movie as if that excuses it. It shoves the creepy-kid trope down our throats and though I want to see kids in my horror movies, creepy or otherwise, it is just annoying and the ending made me want to scream; again in the worst possible way.Easter is a horrific waste of perfectly good make-up. Well it was good make-up before started speaking, then it looks fake as s***. An irritating dialogue exchange leads to camp attempts at horror and a cliche conclusion.Mother's Day could have been an pretty good story and it's sort of intriguing despite its heavy handed use of dialogue. But it just doesn't go anywhere.Father's Day is what I'm tempted to say is the best short of the bunch. Despite its artificial and amateurish dialogue delivered poorly by an actor who I can believe does mostly foreign language dubs for a living, it plods along intriguingly enough but, again, we end with what is basically just the audience getting flipped off.Halloween is the one that should have been a dark comedy more than the others. Horror set on Halloween is a hat on a hat and can maybe work if you get a really good idea, but is otherwise not worth even trying. The most obnoxious conversation ever leads to a lazy plot resolve half way through the story. The rest is just torture porn.Christmas had a pretty good concept and I want to sort of like it. But what's jarring about it is that it expects me to suspend disbelief in two directions at once. The mysterious commodity, the ""UVU"", (pronounced as Yuvyu), is a pretty neat piece of futuristic equipment but how does it work? If you told me it literally reads your mind that would at least be something. Then we might have put some kind of Black Mirror/Orwellian spin on the story. But then it seems to go supernatural. I know that science fiction and fantasy are only superficially different but it still doesn't attempt to sort of justify itself. The acting hear is perhaps the most agreeable in the movie and of all the shorts it had the most potential.New Year is nothing but a lazy, macabre mess."
" Nonsense and waste of time!
",2019-10-29 00:00:00,1,We wasted our time watching this rubbish. It's just a twisted & nonsense storyline that seems to be written by psychopaths. Weird is not even a word to describe this movie - they're trying to be clever and make a brilliant movie using holidays celebration but it was a total waste!
" Wtf is up with the Easter Bunny?
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,6,"Just one thing to say, that Easter Bunny is scary as hell. An Easter Bunny mixed with the Son of God has literally been taking out of the text and and I just think, holy. Pun intended.I loved him because of how disturbing he was. The guy who portrayed him did a very nice job and the look of his character made it very memorable. Let's just say once you see him, you can't unsee him. It becomes burned into your retnas so that even if you wanted to look away, it wouldn't matter.A very enjoyable nightmare."
" Beyond bad - don't waste you time.
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,1,"I'd had this one on the list to watch for a while, since I've enjoyed other anthologies, including some pretty entertaining ones that revolve around holidays. This isn't one of those. Not only was this not entertaining, it was flat out bad. Terrible. Stupid. So bad, it's almost criminal. We didn't even finish the movie, it was so ridiculous. The first segment wasn't great, with poor acting, silly ""theming"" attempts, and a very predictable story line. The second was plain nonsense, with a poorly defined ""plot"", worse acting, and no real mood at all, other than weird. By the third, the quality had, amazingly, declined even more, and we had to stop. No, this isn't ""challenging"" anything. No, this doesn't make you think. This is mind-numbingly bad, in every way. Acting, directing, writing, cinematography, everything.I loved A Christmas Horror Story, and Trick 'r Treat, and had hopes for this film. Those were shattered. Don't waste your time on this mess. It's not worth it."
" Unfortunately all the bad reviews are true
",2019-08-09 00:00:00,3,"Sometimes you do not want to believe it, but in this case Holidays is actually as bad as the majority of reviews say. And I had been warned, so it's not the dashing of too high hopes - I even had no expectations of Kevin Smith anymore after Yoga Hosers and everything you hear about Tusk (couldn't even get myself to watch it). Apart from the misogyny (the episode by Kevin Smith is the most positive, but unfortunately also completely illogical) through all episodes (yes also / especially the female director's one) it is mainly the incredibility and or lack of originality that makes these ""visions"" of these new (and old) ""talents"" a total disaster. But one by one (spoiler alert, I try to keep it down): Valentine's Day: Top clichÃ©: the evil Blonde (as I have mentioned repeatedly: in my experiences, the bullies were the brunettes / black-haired, but against envy-fueled racist prejudice against blond(e)s there is nothing that can be done, and yes, blond people, too, get massively discriminated against), the rest is also super-unoriginal and bleak, St. Patrick's Day: why, please elaborate, is the little girl so spiteful to the teacher who wants to help her ??? Completely meaningless episode and with snake / monster birth also immensely cliched. Easter: Yes, Jesus, who let himself be tortured to death by his father, so that he could make a (?) statement (?), is scary, but everything else: nonsense with (long) ears. And why doesn't the mother put a glass of water on the child's bedside table so that she does not have to get out to begin with? This would have solved the problem - too easy I guess ... Mother's Day: oh dear, there is no medical solution against unwanted pregnancies- have we made a journey back in time to the Stone Age? There are many options beside condoms and as the most massive means there is sterilization for the woman or -in case you want to have children later in life - the sterilization for men, which can easily be undone. Case solved. You do not have to get pregnant unintentionally 21 times and then go to a FERTABILITY ritual (how dumb is this chick? But I forgot: Blondes are stupid - and nasty and selfish and child-hostile etc. etc.) in a sweat lodge and even get compelled to have the child - not to mention the ridiculous ending. The message of this anti-progressive episode is seemingly: women, give birth and do not fight it, otherwise it will be even worse / you will be punished hard. Father's Day: well done - until the more than disappointing ending, which was to be expected from the beginning, no surprise here, pointless. Halloween: the Kevin Smith episode: and surprise: again full of clichÃ©s, but admittedly entertaining, except for the obvious fact that NO viewer would buy/believe that the guy rather mutilates himself than cutting the cable - that would have done it. Pathetically bad. Christmas: neat boredom, no surprise with him, and no successful ingenious ending with her, nothing here as well. New Year: okay, it's somewhat positive that guys who are unkempt and disgusting themselves, who have always or at least since Homer Simpson been thinking that attractive women, just wait for them, are being cured of this error, since the lady is not erotically interested in him / them, however, this ending, too, has been seen a thousand times and it is unnecessary to show that women are as bloodthirsty as men. Conclusion: a few nice approaches, but ultimately all completely wasted. A shame."
" Good fun horror.
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,7,Solid horror movie. Not much sex. No over the top violence. NO POLITICS or Social issues just fun to watch horror. Keep this up Netflix.
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,4,"Interesting and different stories. some good laughs. but I only really liked two of them (1 viewing)
SPOILERSwhich were the Web cam one and online dating one"
" WARNING: !!!viewers beware!!!
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,1,"I am 13 and this has to be the worst thing I've watched. Do not even waste your time watching this movie! It was grotesque and unfortunately, I CANNOT unsee some of those scenes. This sacrilegious movie gave me nightmares. It was horribly made with terrible actors. This movie mocked Jesus and that is not ok. It was, like I said, grotesque. It was extremely inappropriate! The trailer was completely deceiving making the movie look amazing. The next review I'm filing is the review for the trailerð¡"
" A rollercoaster
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,8,"It starts very strong, but goes down a lot in the middle, but rises again towards the end."
" Its ok
",2019-06-01 00:00:00,4,It was ok. I love anthologies so very much but this one was just kind of too crazy for me. I've seen some f'd up stuff but yeah I couldn't get past the 4th or 5th story.
" Cool theme, not without its flaws, but a solid entry for less demanding horror fans
",2019-05-28 00:00:00,5,"This movie is comprised of shorts for each holiday as follows: Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Easter, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Halloween, Christmas, and New Year's Eve, you get the picture, if you like theme horror, this is the collection for you.The quality of the shorts vary. Overall, the first short, Valentine's Day, is the one I enjoyed the most. I found the characters compelling, from the contrast of the dark haired, outcast girl with dark hair to the bitchy blonde antagonist to the story's violent and well placed ending, it was by far my favorite.Others such as Father's Day and Christmas had cool concepts, but weak endings. I enjoyed them, but I think theses two in particular could be better served as blueprints for feature versions.St. Patrick's Day had some really creepy moments, especially if snakes aren't your thing.Mother's Day to me personally was boring. It's a captive situation type of story. It just didn't click with me. Same with New Years Eve. It had moments with a bait and switch in characters, but overall it was a weak ending to the entire collection.Halloween was the only one I really hated, which is ironic that I found this to be the worst holiday in a horror collection. It was actually cool until the story's main antagonist started to get his comeuppance, which you would think would be satisfying, but the way it is executed is so lame. When Halloween ended I saw that this short was done by Kevin Smith, in my opinion, he needs to stick to making dick jokes."
" ABC's of Death?
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,4,Does this remind anyone else of the ABC's of Death?
" Holidays are fun however......
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,1,This is in short absolutely the most garbage piece of film making I have ever seen in my 40yrs on this planet.
" Complete rubbish
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,1,"I've given it 1 because I can't give it 0. A woman giving birth to a snake and a Cross between Jesus and the Easter Bunny. Yes really! It just feels cheap and pointless. It's not even stories, it's scenes. Nothing is ever explained or finished. Everything is just pointless!!! Thank the lord this isn't something I bought!!!"
" Only one is really worth it for me, but the rest either don't try or fall flat in their attempts.
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,3,"Father's Day was pretty good! It was emotional, intriguing, and didn't spoon feed you all of the answers, but let you sirt of come to your own conclusion! If you have 15 minutes to spare, I'd say turn it on. ONLY that one, because the rest are either boring and cookie cutter, or just random and stupid. I love Kevin Smith, but this attempt at horror/comedy just didn't work for me with his Halloween segment. Keep in mind, I actually fairly enjoyed Tusk. Valentine's Day was predictable. Easter was probably the second best, but nothing was very special besides maybe the design of the bunny. And lastly Christmas, St. Patrick's Day and Mother's Day were ALL awful! There isn't really much else to say about them, check out Father's Day and maybe Easter, but just skip the rest."
" Holidays: Mediocre
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,5,"I had such high hopes for Holidays, I adore horror anthology's and one featuring the writing of Kevin Smith and starring Seth Green and Harley Morenstein! Sign me up.Sadly it didn't quite meet my expectations, and that is such a blinding shame.You see horror anthology's are generally 3-4 stories and a wraparound, Holidays dismisses the wraparound and instead tells a whopping 8 short stories (Each one based on a different holiday).This heavily reminded me of the ABC's of Death (2012) which was another horror anthology I was super excited for but turned out to be dire. That as well had a vast number of stories, different directors, writers and similar themes. Thankfully Holidays isn't that bad, but only because of a couple of the tales.Truth be told several of the 8 are really bad and I mean really bad. They're the kind of shorts you'll see on YouTube that leave you scratching your head afterwards, unsure as to what you just witnessed and what the point of it all was.Thankfully there are a few entertaining nuggets in there, some decent star power and sprinklings of charm. The stories range from weird, to gory, to oddly clever, but none exactly blew me away.My pick would be Valentines Day as the most entertaining with St.Patricks Day being the worst...........or possibly Mother's Day.Holidays on paper should have been fantastic but some disastrous writing near killed it for me, such a shame.The Good:Jocelin Donahue and Harley MorensteinSolid visualsThe Bad:Some really stupid stuff"
" Disturbing as all hell
",2018-12-21 00:00:00,7,"All eight of these film's segments have you wondering two things:
1. What just happened?
2. Can I have more?
Great fun with friends plus an unexpected Seth Green"
" Good
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,10,"Really good movie, really appreciated the horror and thought the actors did a good job"
" Good acting and nice flow and then...leaves you hanging
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,4,"Each of the stories were good in drawing the viewer in. The atmosphere was good and the stories seemed to build up to something interesting....
But only a few stories actually had an ending.
The majority just cut off before the resolution.
Leaving me with an annoyed feeling of not actually getting a story, only a mere intro that led absolutely nowhere.
This is what an anthology looks like when you have no writers.
It\ s all visuals but no substance."
" Very good
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,9,Why the low critics? I loved these short films. I disagree with the ones who say only 2 of the shorts were good. I liked them equally.
" What the fu@k??
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,3,"I didn't expect much from this movie, but even my low expectations weren't met. The only 2 semi-entertaining chapters (Easter and Father's Day) had very unsatisfying endings. The rest of the chapters were GARBAGE."
" Father's Day and St. Patrick's Day were excellent!
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,8,"Father's Day is just about perfectly done, building an uneasy sense of dread and also hitting you right in the gut emotionally. They nailed it with the voiceover selection, and the whole setting just...ughh...creeps you out in one of the best ways, where you can't really place it, but it just feels...ugh. 
St. Patrick's Day as fun and creepy and pretty and hilarious and a delight!
I've re-watched both of these and I'm not usually big on re-watching. Also love recommending to friends and finding out which ones they enjoy the most (anthologies are fun like that, aren't they?)."
" Garbage movie
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,2,"This movie is nearly unwatchable but I made it through it to write this review. This movie can be found on Netflix and tells the stories of different plots and people for each holiday. None of the stories are good and only a few of them are sub-par. I have nothing else that I can say about this trashy, nearly 2 hour long movie. If you want to watch it, be my guest. Look it up on Netflix and maybe enjoy it..."
" A grotesque approach to the established holidays...
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,5,"""Give me your heart"" - This was actually a fairly good story about giving your heart for valentine's day. This segment had a wonderfully disturbing character, whom was very nicely acted.""St. Patricks Day"" - Well, I found this segment to be a very odd and bizarre story about a woman being pregnant with a reptile. With that being said, it should be said, in all fairness, that it was nicely acted. And it was definitely among some of the more weird things I have seen in a movie.""Easter"" - Now, this was a wonderful combination of mixing the commercialized Easter tradition with the biblical version. I must admit that I have never seen a half-rabbit, half-Jesus creature before now.""Mothers Day"" - A very pointless story, which didn't really fit into the anthology all that that greatly.""Father's Day"" - This was the opposite of the ""Mother's Day"" segment, as it was very nicely narrated. And it was certainly a very suspenseful and thrilling addition to the anthology, although the ending was somewhat anti-climatic.""Halloween"" - While it was a very entertaining segment, it seemed somewhat out of place here. I guess it was the sex industry backdrop that didn't work well to fit into the anthology.""Christmas"" - Surely had an interesting concept about seeing yourself and your actions through virtual reality glasses. And it was a twisted story indeed that fitted nicely into the anthology. It was nice to see Seth Green here.""New Year's"" - Ah, now this was among the most entertaining and surprising of all the stories in the anthology and definitely one of my favorite segments.If you enjoy horror anthology, then perhaps you should check out ""Holidays"", as it has different themes, yet still all combined underneath the universal theme of holidays. You might actually find something unique, very entertaining and suitable for your particular preference here."
" ROSEMARY'S REPTILE
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,6,"This is a collection of short stories (about 10 minutes each) of the following holidays: Valentine, St Patrick, Easter, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Halloween, Christmas, and New Year's. I did enjoy a few of the stories sometimes thinking they would have been a better feature length film such as St. Patrick. I was least excited about Father's Day. Warning to religious folk, the Easter Bunny has the wounds of Jesus as the film combines the two tales. I am not sure why a cassette tape, even when old would pop and click like a record.The efforts seemed half-baked.Guide: F-word. Ample nudity in Mother's Day episode."
" Your holidays will never be the same.
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,8,"This anthology of dark tales with holiday themes will take a skewed attitude and appreciation for gory, gruesome, creepy and horror. These stories deal with Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Easter, Father's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Halloween, Christmas and New Year's Eve. Some are tense and scary; some will easily be forgettable. All in all, I really had fun watching and even flinched a few times. Some pretty good acting. The Easter story may be the creepiest. The New Year's Eve tale will twist and turn giving you the shakes. The atmosphere and cinematography make these short horror stories worth watching.The cast features: Harley Quinn Smith, Lorenza Izzo, Jocelin Donahue, Seth Green, Morgan Duffy, Andrew Bowen, Ashley Greene, Rick Peters, Michael Gross, and Sophie Traub."
" Pretty good holidays
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,7,OKay for this short stories they are for the most part there good some are Valentines is somewhat not that good. Let me explain the girl who thinks the coach is attracted too her. Easter fathers day and Halloween are pretty good but I guess the stories were jump out of your seat but you kinda knew what was going to happen. Like for Fathers day you know something was up with Father when the Daughter wanted to see him and something happened to them both. Oh and the other thing for Mothers day you kinda knew but it was still since she gave birth to a grown up man I think.
" A laughably weak horror anthology
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,4,"Horror anthologies are always a risky business. With multiple writers and directors, there's bound to be an inconsistency in quality throughout. At least with this, given that the shorts, all based on a different holiday, are consistently bad, there is a consistent level of quality throughout. Valentine: (2.5/5) A blatant Carrie rip-off with some dangling plot threads and a lack of explanation, but at least it gets the black comedy angle of the anthology right and has a clever ending. St Patrick's Day: (1/5) A laughably stupid dud in every sense. What were they thinking?Easter: (1.5/5) One good jump scare aside, this is tedious, tasteless and toothless. Mother's Day: (1/5) A terrible body horror short where pretty much nothing happens. Oh, and then just when something is happening, it ends. Father's Day: (3.5/5) A cleverly constructed and told short story which is arguably the best of the bunch in many ways, but it's still too open-ended and vague to satisfy. Halloween: (3.5/5) An effective, squirm-inducing dark comedy that is both amusing and uncomfortable, although it is complete nonsense. Christmas: (2.5/5) They had a great idea here... which they did absolutely nothing with and once again it ends just as it's starting to get interesting. New Year's Eve: (2.5/5) More formulaic stuff which is mildly entertaining but just too predictable. These films aren't scary, but they're not meant to be. They're meant to be dark, uncomfortable comedies. Sadly, the stories are weak and just lack any true meaning or point. I learnt something important in Film Studies: when you make a short film, the story should start when the film ends in a way. That's a good thing to remember if you're making a short film and that is basically what all these shorts do. But... don't forget to get the audience interested and actually give them enough information to leave them satisfied! Evidently, these writers and directors forgot that.4/10"
" Holidays Of Horror For Those That Dare
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,8,"Just like most celebrated chefs go out for straight-forward, juicy cheeseburgers, after a 12 hour shift, Holidays is what active filmmakers create in-between having to produce money making block buster films. This is self indulgent artistry, and not to be confused with a filmmaker's desire to placate the critics. I wasn't surprised to read so many negative reviews. Art is a matter of taste, and to me, this horror anthology, often tasteless, was still fairly fun to watch. No real spoilers here. Each holiday episode speaks for itself in terms of concept and execution.Valentine's Day: A young high school student with a unmistakable crush on her swim instructor. A very decent homage to Carrie (the original film). On a Creepy scale this ranked pretty high.St. Patrick's Day: A nice teacher who would like to have a baby but one of her students (a very strange little girl) has other plans. I felt like I'd seen this plot device before. Nothing new here.Easter: This was my favorite segment, and in my opinion the most chilling of all. The Easter Bunny will never seem the same after watching this remarkable short story. Very high on the ""don't watch this one alone"" scale. Truly scary, weird, tense, way out there, and executed very nicely.Mother's Day: A ritualistic pregnancy theme steeped in the supernatural. Like St. Patrick's Day I felt that I'd seen this before.Father's Day: My second favorite segment, was subtle, gentle, and seriously visual. Probably the most thought-provoking film in the group. Filmed in the Salton Sea, Anthony Scott Burns story is perfectly haunting, and probably could be expanded into a full length feature film. Jocelin Donahue, as Carol, delivers a deeply touching performance. And yes, that's really Michael Gross on the tape player! The abrupt ending puzzled me, which, was probably intentional. I'd love to read how other viewers interpreted the ambiguous final scene.Halloween: The most anticipated segment directed by the fearless, often crude (except in sweet films like Chasing Amy), Kevin Smith. Should I mention it has ""very little"" to do with Halloween? It was cool to see Smith's daughter in an acting role.Christmas: Seth Green is wonderful in this very twisted story about gift giving at Christmas, and how things can go badly very quickly. Green is known for his hilarious improvisational performances, but this segment clearly wasn't meant to be fun, and what it delivers is painfully frightening!New Year's Eve: This short contained the most gore, probably too much for me, but it was watchable, and beyond what I had expected with a neatly executed twist ending!I understand that these type of eclectic productions won't garner a ton of positive reviews, but overall it's not difficult to enjoy Holidays. There's something there for everyone!"
" Interesting ideas, rushed scripts, some nice styles
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,5,"This is a collection of short horror stories themed by different holidays.The ideas and stories are somewhat good and interesting. The scripts - especially endings - are quite rushed tho. I was surprised how often the ending seemed completely random. As if the whole episode was just a build up (and many are good at that), then they just suddenly pull the plug without any explanation and proceed to another episode. The episodes are really short, which makes this an easy watch, you don't have time to get bored as it's mostly a build up after a build up. There were a few with a proper ending tho.The direction and acting are pretty good for the most part. There are some episodes that are really good looking with a lot of emphasis put on style, cinematography etc. Stylistically very different, but you can see that the directors have had fun directing these episodes. Many directors I had never even heard of, but even tho the styles vary and differ a lot, they are mostly very well directed.Some of the stand out episodes for me were st. patrick's and father's day, which was probably the best even tho the ending sucked big time. Kevin Smith is the big name in this compilation, but I wouldn't say horror is his forte. His episode has Kevin Smith written all over it with snappy dialog and ""adult/potty humour"". The new years episode had pretty interesting style and acting.Interesting for the stylistic efforts, but clearly too short stories (maybe 10 min each) for anything serious."
" Had Potential...But Failed On So Many Levels
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,2,"With The Tales of Halloween comes this anthology of horror shorts centered round the iconic holiday seasons all year around. It only has 8 stories with each of them dark, sinister & twisted one way or the other!Now I've seen the VHS Films, ABCs of Death, Trick 'r Treat, The Reaping etc. All of which were really good & amazing! So you could image, I had high hopes for this one & from the Valentines Short to kick off this film I really was hoping the others would deliver in the same way if not better. But sadly, the others were either weak, confusing or completely unimaginative! Let's go through the list:1. Valentine's Day (written & directed by Kevin KÃ¶lsch & Dennis Widmyer)A teenager with a crush on her gym coach is bullied by the rest of her classmates, but an innocent Valentine's Day gesture leads to horrific results.This was the one & only short I actually liked! It was straight forward, sinister, dark & pretty twisted! Yet had a pretty satisfying ending! Really liked this one!2. St. Patrick's Day (written & directed by Gary Shore)A young teacher learns the frightening truth about the legendary snakes of St. Patrick. A student makes her deepest wish come true, with a sick twist.This one wasn't great, it was dull, boring & quite dumb. It could've be great, but it simply didn't catch me!3. Easter (written & directed by Nicholas McCarthy)A young girl who wakes up and sees the Easter Bunny arrive is in for a shock.This one was a bit better than St. Patrick's Day, but still not great, it was a little too subtle for my tastes!4. Mother's Day (written & directed by Sarah Adina Smith) A woman who can't stop getting pregnant finds herself involved with a coven of barren witches after attending a strange ritual.This one was much to samey & similar to St. Patrick's Day! It was too subtle & wasn't great. It again never captured my interest!5. Father's Day (written & directed by Anthony Scott Burns)A teacher receives a mysterious cassette tape from her long- estranged father that leads to a darker mystery. The answer for why he disappeared may not be what she expected.Again, like the previous 3, it was way too subtle & dragged out & didn't do much for me in terms of straight forward story-line & in- your-face gore!6. Halloween (written & directed by Kevin Smith)A man running an internet cam sex business finds himself in dire straits when he crosses his employees on Halloween.This one was just outright sexist & stupid beyond belief! It was simply just the turning point of the film where I felt it was shite & still going to continue as since since the first short, Valentines Day, & the other shorts including this just where shite, this however, took the cake!7. Christmas (written & directed by Scott Stewart)A man goes to terrible lengths to get a virtual reality device for his son for Christmas, but finds himself haunted by it.Was a slight step up from the others though not as good as Valentines Day, this was alright, but still not the greatest!8.New Year's Eve (written by Kevin KÃ¶lsch & Dennis Widmyer; directed by Adam Egypt Mortimer) A disturbed young man discovers that his New Year's date may be just as twisted.Just when I thought the film couldn't get any worse, this just went from stupid to utter BEEP! I mean this one just ending the film on a pretty bad note & it was sad because there was nothing good about this one, I mean, yeah it was bloody but, nah it was just kak! Then.... The film ends, only 8 shorts? Wow. It was a major pi$$ take when the credits rolled, as it seemed that since, Valentines Day, there wasn't a even half as good shorts I liked. 1 out of 8, 7 of which just sucked so that leaves me no choice to give this film a low rating of 2! If there was 4 out of 8 shorts which were great, it would've been ace, but sadly there was only one that I liked! Such a shame, 2/10 & this film could've been so much better!"
" Hilariously bad
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,9,"'So bad it's good' is a very difficult thing to pull of, but just within the first 30 seconds we were entranced with what can only be described as the absolute worst acting ever put to film.The absolute highlight personally (spoilers!) was when a schoolteacher became pregnant because of a creepy red-headed child. At that point it was just bad, but then you see the nurse in the hospital asks with genuine concern if she has been with any animals lately. Apparently this happens with such frequency that pregnancy tests have evolved to spot mystical reptile pregnancies. When her sister scolded her when she missed her appointment with the vet tears were rushing down my face.Every prediction we made was out-weirded by this movie. There is nothing like it.I don't want to spoil too much, but gather some friends and enjoy the best comedy from 2016."
" Holidays is a mixed bag with both good and bad shorts but at the end it gives a satisfying experience.
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,6,"Holidays (2016):Anthologies always serve as a good feast for film lovers especially horror film buffs.Everyone loves scary stories and love to watch horror movies.Anthologies act as great platform where no.of horror shorts are shown one after another as a feature film.Holidays is one such anthology feature film that puts a uniquely dark and original spin on some of the most iconic and beloved holidays of all time.We have 8 segments here.1)Valentine's day,written & directed by Kevin KÃ¶lsch & Dennis Widmyer.Plot: A teenager with a crush on her gym coach is bullied by the rest of her classmates, but an innocent Valentine's Day gesture leads to horrific results.This short is highly predictable and nothing engaging.Just a below average one. My rating 5/102)St.Patrick's Day,written & directed by Gary ShorePlot: A young teacher,who wants a baby, learns the frightening truth about the legendary snakes of St. Patrick. A student makes her deepest wish come true, with a horrifying twist at end.This short has the best unique idea in this anthology but this short is also one of the bad works here.Despite having such great plot and background score,this short failed to impress with slow narration. My rating 5/103)Easter,written & directed by Nicholas McCarthy.Plot: A young girl who wakes up and sees the Easter Bunny arrive is in for a shock.Easter Bunny is never the same for what they have said in tales.This short has creepiest atmosphere and one of the best makeup work I had ever seen.Easter Bunny's makeup itself gives us creeps.This short is bit silly but still a good scary one.My rating 7/10.4)Mother's Day,written and directed by Sarah Adina Smith.Plot: The concept is basically a young girl becomes pregnant every single time she has sex.She finds herself involved with a coven of barren witches after attending a strange ritual.This short is the most useless entry in this anthology.It is lengthy,uninteresting and highly predictable.Music is great though.Worst one in the list.My rating 4/105)Father's day:Plot: A teacher receives a mysterious cassette tape from her long-estranged father that leads to a darker mystery. The answer for why he disappeared may not be what she expected.This short is without a doubt the most gripping entry in the production.It has everything what a horror film needed.An interesting plot,spooky music,dark atmosphere,nice pace and good acting.But the ending is not at all satisfying.They just gave an unnecessary jump scare and ended it abruptly.Wish this could be corrected and make this into a feature film.My rating 7.5/106)Halloween,written and directed by Kevin Smith.Plot:A man running an internet cam sex business finds himself in dire straits when he crosses his employees on Halloween.This short is hilarious but disturbing revenge horror in this list.The way the cam girls take revenge on their boss is good idea but not great.Just an OK watch.Lesser duration helped it.My rating 6/107)Christmas,written and directed by Scott Stewart.Plot: A man goes to terrible lengths to get a virtual reality device for his son for Christmas, but finds himself haunted by it.This short is a weird one like St.Patrick's day short,This one seems more like technical developments an their effects.My rating 6.5/108)New Year,written by Kevin KÃ¶lsch & Dennis Widmyer and directed by Adam Egypt Mortimer.Plot: A psychopath who has a habit of abducting girls who rejects him meets a new date on 31st night.Bit little did he know that that girl is also may be same twisted as himself.A good finish to this anthology.Bit predictable but this short is well made with brilliant performances and cinematography.My rating 7/10.So,Holidays is a mixed bag with both good and bad shorts but at the end it gives a satisfying experience.My rating 6.5/10"
" A mixed bag that still worth a watch
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,6,"*For my spoiler free review please only read the last two lines of this review*I was expecting a lot more out of this...-Valentine's day is a pretty good one (reminded me of the movie ""Carrie"" which is a good thing) and one of the segments I liked the most. I Highly recommend it ! -St. Patrick's day was one of the worst and didn't make sense at all (even by horror movies standards). The final payoff was also extremely disappointing, I was expecting a shocking twist after more than 10 minutes of intense build-up. The whole segment felt not scary at all,uninspired and just plain boring and a waste of time.-Easter had VERY good specials effects, makeup and costume but the girl accepting to leave everything behind her to become the new Easter bunny (just because the Jesus/Bunny said that she cannot refuse) seemed very hard to believe it would have been more believable if she started running away from him or alerting her mother ! And the ending of Easter is very lackluster : The mother just ends up locked out of her house then it fade to black The End. Still worth a watch anyway. -Mother's day felt very slow-paced and that was not a good thing in that case. I was expecting its ending to have a unexpected twist to act as a saving grace, but sadly it only ends *spoilers* with her giving birth and a bloody arm emerging from between her legs and the hand gripping to her mother's leg trying to get out, and then it fades to black and the segment ends, exactly like in the trailer, nothing more, nothing less. Just a slow-paced ""borefest"" that ends with a lazy clichÃ© ending. -Father's day was surprisingly good and had a very intense suspenseful atmosphere, that only a small bunch of horror movies could make me feel that way, I was on the edge of my seat to see how it will end. Only for it to end with the biggest letdown of the entire movie : it ends with a stupid jump scare that ruined the whole buildup. I felt ""bitter"" and it just felt like a stab in the back to get us so emotionally invested only to end it with a stupid jump scare that just ruin the entire thing. I would still recommend it, but I suggest skipping the last minute. -Halloween in my opinion was pretty stupid and borderline childish and immature. It is about a man that runs a sex business end up sequestered in a room by his fellow prostitutes, with a electrical sex toy (dildo) up his butt that keeps getting him electric shocks unless he cut his genitals off with a knife on camera... the whole thing didn't felt plausible at all and was just plain silly. And as a final slap in the face for the viewers the segment ends up with an awful pun! It may be enjoyable if you're drunk, otherwise it's just childish.-Christmas was pretty good too, I have no negative points about it, is was pretty enjoyable. It felt a lot like an episode of ""Black Mirror"". Fans of ""Black Mirror"" would find it enjoyable for sure.This segment worth a watch. -New Year's eve was one of the best segment! The final twist was unexpected and enjoyable, I was pretty surprised by it! Only minor down point was the very obvious dummy/mannequin at the end, but except from that, the segment was very good ! The movie was a mixed bag IMO. If I had to recommend this movie I'd say to avoid the following segments if you don't want to waste your time : St. Patrick's day, Mother's day and maybe Halloween. The other segments are pretty good though !ï»¿"
" Definitely worth a watch
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"What is everyone complaining about? It seems impossible to please a horror fan these days.Holidays is a decent anthology horror comprised of eight shorts each with a different holiday theme; Valentine's Day, St Patricks Day, Easter, Mother's Day, Father's Day, Halloween, Christmas and New Year's Eve. My favorites are Easter, Mothers Day, Halloween and Christmas.They're interesting, different and each one doesn't last too long, what's not to like? If you like anthology movies you'll definitely like Holidays.If you haven't watched it all I can say is GIVE IT A GO."
