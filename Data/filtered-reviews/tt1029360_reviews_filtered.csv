" Anyone for another soulless remake?
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,4,"Maybe if I haven't watched the original I would rate this one higher. But this one is just lazy almost exact copy of Poltergeist from 1982. Only without tension, cool visuals or atmosphere. Watch original and forget about this one."
" How did Jared Harris get messed up in this.
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,1,What a horrible remake. I wasn't expecting it to be great but it wasn't even watchable.
" Cool
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,10,Great film loved it some bits are jumpy but great film
" Poltergeist
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,1,"This was a really bad, poorly acted remake of the 1982 classic with the same name. The writing is so poor, the acting is terrible, and the script is bad. Don't even know how this movie was made. It's not even scary like the first one.-2/10
1 star is a compliment."
" Charmless and Scare-Free
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,2,"Imagine if someone were to take the bare bones of the original Poltergeist and drained them of all charm, humanity, and terror. Do that and you'll have some idea of how this remake of Poltergeist plays. It refuses to rise to the occasion every step of the way and makes for one painfully unmemorable viewing experience. It's one of the most brain dead and cynical studio cash grabs I've ever had the misfortune of seeing. When even a seasoned pro like Sam Rockwell has given up and seems to be sleepwalking through your movie, you know you have a problem.They try to bring in modern technology like cell phones, computers, flat screen TVs, and the Tangina character is now a ghost hunting show host, but none of it helps or justifies the story's need to be retold in the slightest."
" Just a bit pointless
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,5,"It's been a few years since I watched and was underwhelmed by this remake so thought I'd give it another look. To be fair on second viewing it isn't quite as terrible as I had first thought, almost enjoyable really except for the boy playing Griffin. I was taken out of the film with every badly acted word he uttered and expression he made. I can only assume he is in some way related to someone with some pull in the industry because the rest of the casting wasn't bad at all.
It's not a touch on the original, even the effects aren't that that special considering it's been over 30 years.
All in all I don't really understand why they bothered so half heartedly.
Just revisit the original it is far superior"
" Very Great...
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,8,"This film haunted (the original) my childhood / adolescence for a long time, even in love with terror, they did not leave my mind, that tree... Fear... This one is very different from that, everything in this and more colorful, with more effects, the original was darker, scary, the touch of mystery was emblematic and frightening ... But a great remake ..."
" Imagine The Original But Without The Heart, Emotion & Scares
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,1,I like Sam Rockwell so despite my issue with remakes I wanted to give this once a chance but it is an empty shell and not even worth of the name of its predecessor. This one is nothing but a cash grab without any of the heart the Freelings gave to the original story and the well done supernatural scares of the first one which stemmed for our care for the characters have been replaced with flat attempted jump scares and drawn out sequences. Do yourself a favor and re-watch the original first two Poltergeist movies and save this 2 hours of your life from being flushed down the toilet. I'll even go a step further and say go out and buy Poltergeist 3 to own before paying the rental fee on this empty husk. Sorry Sam Rockwell - even you couldn't save this film.
" Sad and Bland
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,3,A suburban family has to save their daughter from the astral plane after she's kidnapped by evil spirits.What a missed opportunity this was. To have a cast this wonderful and a perfectly constructed skeleton of a story and waste it like this should be considered a crime. There's hardly a scare or intense moment to be found here and the parents who were so well developed in the first film essentially take a back seat and let the son character do all the heavy lifting.
" Excellent Modern Remake...
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,10,"I don't know what everyone's moaning about it's an excellent remake. It brings in modern day paranormal investigation techniques with some great effects. Not once did I think they were acting, the whole cast did a great job...and without ruining anything the ending is excellent."
" Weak Everything...Characters, Acting, Directing
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,"This whole remake is just sad. All the strength the original characters had has been washed away into a predictable trope of a movie with bad acting galore. This feels like a made for TV remake. All the strength the original characters had is not to be found here. The character of the son is given a bigger part in the this movie and it is a huge detriment to the film as his acting is by far the worst of all. The strong character of the mother wonderfully portrayed by Jo-Beth Williams in the original is tossed aside to make room for the others characters to have more screen time with the poltergeist but it actually makes the film less scary by doing so. The film completely lacks the touching moments the original had and the somewhat deeper observations about the afterlife that helped the original suck you in and make you care what happened to these people. Not scary, not fun, not interesting, not even bad in the good way. Just a bore from start to finish."
" Not spooky or scary
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,1,"I'm just going to get to the point, this movie sucked, even the ""they're here"" is terrible! I wanted to watch this with my family and we either fell asleep or were hella bored. The only thing that was mildly ""scary"" was that short scene where the dad puked dirt, but that's just scary for me because I have emetophobia...
Also, they try to shove dumb stuff, like the paranormal investigator's love life. This is a dumb review, but this movie is dumber, my dad watched the OG movie and he was also disappointed. Don't recommend, at all."
" The worst remake ever!!
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,1,"This is a horrible remake. The acting sucks, the music is bad and it's not scary like the original was. Sam Rockwell and Rosemary De Witt don't even seem upset that their daughter is missing. It's odd.Who are these people that set up everything in the house? So random. It's just bad acting. The original had great actors, directing and music and more scariness to it. There is no connection between the characters and it doesn't feel like they are really a close family. This remake is terrible & a waste of time."
" Terrible Remake
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,3,"If you like your horror films predictable and bland with zero heart whatsoever, Poltergeist might just tickle your fancy. They've cast wonderful actors Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt to play the parents in this reboot of the classic franchise and it gives them next to nothing to do. There's none of the warmth that was so winning with the Freeling family in the original and that sinks the movie more than the lousy CGI and other modern enhancements. The Tangina character is now an Irish paranormal TV host. Why? I'm not sure, but he's not as interesting as Tangina either. Nothing in this is an improvement or even offers an interesting angle into the story, so why bother?"
" Acting 100
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,4,Perfection at its finest. That dad's acting was on fire.
" Poltergeist
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,4,"The original Tobe Hooper version of Poltergeist is a pretty scary 80s movie, it was probably inevitable there would be a remake one day, produced by Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead, The Grudge, Don't Breathe), directed by Gil Kenan (Monster House). Basically, married couple Eric (Sam Rockwell) and Amy Bowen (Rosemarie DeWitt) are looking for a new home for them and their three children, sixteen-year-old daughter Kendra (Saxon Sharbino), nine-year-old son Griffin (Kyle Catlett), and six-year-old daughter Madison (Kennedi Clements). They are shown a house that has recently come on the market and fits their price range, so they purchase it and move in. The first night, they hear strange noises in the walls and Griffin finds a box full of clown dolls. In the middle of the night, lights and electronic devices start turning on and off, as an unseen force moves through the home. The commotion wakes Griffin, he goes downstairs and finds Maddie talking to something in the television. She tells Griffin someone is coming, when he tries to unplug the TV, the lights to go out of control. While touching the TV screen, Maddie turns and tells the family ""They're here"". The following evening, the three children are left at home while Eric and Amy go out with friends for dinner. Talking about their house, Eric and Amy learn that it was built on an old cemetery, but the property developer supposedly relocated the human remains. Kendra wakes and investigates the laundry room after hearing strange noises, there the floor cracks open, oozing sludge, and a corpse's hand emerges to pull at her feet. Meanwhile, the clown dolls in Griffin's room are moving themselves, and one tries to attack Griffin, until he destroys it with his foot. Running from his bedroom, he finds Maddie in her room, scared, crouching in a corner, and tells her to stay while he goes to find Kendra. Maddie is then lured by the light from her lamp and her favourite toy into her closet, entering and getting lost in unending void. She turns to see her bedroom drifting away, and ghosts drag her into the darkness. Griffin is grabbed by the branches of the old tree outside the house and dragged through the window, pulling him outside. Amy and Eric return and see Griffin being tossed around by the tree, which releases its grip when they come close, while Kendra has freed herself and hysterically tells them she cannot find Maddie. They Maddie's voice coming from the television, and her static hand is seen touching Amy's hand from the other side of the screen. Amy and Griffin visit the Paranormal Research department for help. The staff set up equipment in the house and give GPS devices to everyone in the house. One of the crew, Boyd (Nicholas Braun), has a near death experience when a spirit yanks his arm against the wall and starts drilling through the wall. While trying to contact Maddie, Eric is ambushed in the closet by a ghost resembling her. Angered, he throws a piece of debris into the darkness of the closet, and this piece falls through a portal from the ceiling of the living room, revealing a way for Maddie to escape. The investigators deduce and confirm that the haunting is caused by a poltergeist. The lead investigator, Dr Brooke Powell (Jane Adams), decides to call occult specialist and television personality, also her ex, Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris). Carrigan explains that Maddie possibly psychic, and that the trapped ghosts are angry as only their headstones were moved, not their remains, and they want to use Maddie ""to free them from their purgatory"". Carrigan comes up with a plan to get Maddie back. He ties a rope in Maddie's room and tosses it into the vortex. They send Griffin's drone into the void hoping to guide Maddie out, but it is destroyed by the ghosts. Griffin, feeling guilty for leaving Maddie alone in the first place, goes through the portal himself. When he finds Maddie, the ghosts try to trap them by destroying the group, but Griffin and Maddie grab onto it and fall back through the portal into the house. Both children are unconscious and covered in grey matter, so they washed and eventually they awake. The family get in their car and begin to leave the house, but the ghosts drag them back and attempt to abduct Maddie again, flipping the car in the process. Maddie is dragged up the stairs, but the family saves her from being sucked into the portal. Carrigan decides he must go into the vortex and lead the spirits into the light. Kendra destroys the television as ghosts' hands are seen through the screen. The Bowens flee the neighbourhood as the house is destroyed by the spirits soaring into the sky as a beacon of light. The investigation team look for any sign that Carrigan managed to get back. The Bowens look for a new house, the realtor shows them a house with large closets and an old tree in the backyard, but the Bowens drive away laughing. During the end credits, it is revealed that Carrigan survived the incident and is back filming his ghost hunting show, co-hosting with Dr Powell. Also starring Susan Heyward as Sophie, Karen Ivany as Mrs. Stoller, and Patrick Garrow as Mr. Stoller. Rockwell, DeWitt and Harris and the supporting younger cast members all do their parts fine, it sticks to the same plot and format, from the evil clown, and the recognisable catchphrase. It is updated with modern technology going against the spirits, and the special effects are both traditional and digital, obviously it is not as scary as the original, and it full of predictability and cliches, but it is a reasonable supernatural horror. Okay!"
" Watch Poltergeist (1982), NOT this movie!!!
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,2,"The worst remake I've ever seen in my life!!! Don't waste your time, just watch the Poltergeist movie from 1982..."
" There's nothing about this that's good
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,5,"Lame horror.'Poltergeist' offers nothing. It may not be an absolutely awful watch, but there's nothing about this that's good unfortunately. The story is largely predictable and plain, none of the cast give anything close to a performance that's worth remembering. There aren't many, if any, scares either - not great for a film in this genre.As for the onscreen talent, it's slim pickings... not even Jared Harris' late appearance could save things. If I had to pick a standout, away from Harris, it would be Sam Rockwell. The two youngest kids, Kyle Catlett and Kennedi Clements, aren't terrible in fairness.Not one I'll be revisiting. Yawnful."
" An offense to the classic!
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,6,"The original film is a masterpiece, a classic film with a special feeling, totally revolutionary in the horror genre. This remake is offesinve, bad performances, stupid direction, awful special effects and the script was filled of trash. The emotive scenes of the original now are comical ones, what a stupidity! I can't deny this 2015 remake has some interesting scene but no more. A waste of time."
" Ouch!
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,4,"Sam Rockwells acting killed the movie from the get go, it gets really over the top and enters into whimsical near the end. The CGI affects are great and mystifying at times, but the horrible writing and acting gave this movie no hope, which is a shame because I really was hoping the reviews were not accurate."
" Sam Rockwell is normally a decent actor
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,3,"He was really bad in this, perhaps not the role for him. Not that anyone was a really good actor in the movie, which means the writing and directing was at fault. Not a horror movie, almost felt like it was making fun of horror movies."
" Wtf did I just watch
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,1,"It's good at the beginning, and became worst till the end ugh to much cringey"
" Bad... very bad
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,3,The movie starts like every low-budget horror movie - A family buys a new house which is haunted by ghosts and that kind of stuff. It tries copy the original Poltergeist movie from 1982 but it really didn't work at all. The movie was made more like a adventure not a horror. I wanted to like it but no... just couldn't.
" Too cliche to be enjoyable
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,5,I always enjoy Jared Harris in everything he does and it was great to see him in this movie. The story and events were very cut and paste from the original which left little to be enjoyed by those of us who have seen it. If you are going to see it then its probably not a bad idea to watch it at x1.1 speed because its very boring at the start. Nuff said.
" 2015 Poltergeist...don't know how I missed this movie!
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,9,"I overheard my daughter talking about the remake of Poltergeist and I was like WHAT? I looked into IMDB and sure enough, there it was. I LOVED the original and had to see what a remake could do. I thought it was terrific! I always read the reviews and wow...there are a ton of haters on this movie! So to all of you people who gave this movie a 1 to 4 stars, just know I hate you to your very core. The little girl looks so much like the original girl, it's kinda spooky. The special effects were great and...um...the clown part. Yeah, I hate clowns so bad, you don't even know. For me, that was the creepiest part of both this and the 1982 version. If I was that kid, finding that clown, It would be in the backyard burn pile in the next few minutes. Anyway, sorry to ramble, I loved this movie and It's great fun. I'd really put this on my list of movies to watch. Peace."
" Not sure why people hate it!!
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,8,A decent movie. Not the best horror out there but pretty good. People are just obsessed with being the person who thinks the originals are better. The original was boring.
" What a waste of time,even if it is quaratine time
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,1,"I was really hoping that someone could pull this off but apprantly not even the great Sam Rami could muster up enough talent to save this God-awful remake.Sometimes remakes end up better than the original because of all the new tech, but nothing could pull this steaming pile of waste out of the toilet. I wonder if they dosed the entire crew with sleeping pills the acting was so dead. Esp the father behaved in ways I have never seen a real father behave, where in the hell do they their actors?
I have seen more talent at high school plays, and who wrote this crap unbelievable lines coming from unbelievable actors. I am sure my cat could deliver lines that would be more believable. The Original Poltergeist is a shining gem, this remake was a Steaming pile of excrement and that is putting it nicely. waste you time if you want, I guess that will pass time while we are all quarantine.or better yet watch the Original and have a good scare."
" It's so bad that its good again
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,10,"The ""horror"" in this movie is so bad that you can laugh about it. I had had a really good time watching this movie with my friends"
" Why?
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,1,"Why in the WORLD would this be remade? There are SO many remakes, reboots and whatever other term they use to try and fool the audience into thinking this will be a good movie.I can't imagine that Heather O'Rourke, Dominique Dunne, and all the others who have passed since the original was made haven't rolled over in their graves.Absolutely disgusting. Watch the original."
" Decent Remake, but Falls Short of the Original
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,7,"This film I actually caught with my family. My parents were visiting me in Cleveland and took me as well as my ex-girlfriend to see this in the theater. I wrote this review that night and haven't revisited it since then if I'm going to be perfectly honest. The synopsis for this remake is a family whose suburban home is haunted by evil forces must come together to rescue their youngest daughter after the apparitions take her captive.We begin with a family looking at a house. The father is Eric Bown (Sam Rockwell) and he's married to Amy (Rosemarie DeWitt). Their eldest daughter is Kendra (Saxon Sharbino) and she is the typical teen with an attitude. She doesn't like the house, because she is not close to her friends or any of the popular places. Their son is the next child, Griffin (Kyle Catlett). He is afraid of the dark and pretty much everything. Amy believes this was done by losing him at the mall some years ago which has left trauma. Their youngest is Madison (Kennedi Clements), who is a cute kid and full of life.We learn that they had a nicer house, but Eric was laid off. Amy has been a stay at home mom who is trying to work on a book, but she has not found time for it with everything going on. They've had to downgrade due to the lack of funds coming in.From the beginning of moving in, Madison begins to talk to something that is in her closet. Griffin asks her who she is talking to and she tells him it is no one. She continues to do this when no one is watching her.Griffin doesn't like his room because of the skylights and the tree that is outside. He then hears something coming from a small door in his room. He opens it and to find a bunch of creepy clown dolls. He then interrupts his parents as they try to get intimate. Eric goes up to the room to prove to him that there is nothing to be afraid of. A squirrel scares both of them. It should also be pointed out that Kednra is watching ghost hunting show that features Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris).The next morning, Eric goes to the store to get some supplies. Amy, Griffin and Madsion are planting flowers along the sidewalk and the boy uncovers a bone. Eric believes it to be an animal, but is it?Some strange and terrifying things happen when Eric and Amy goes to try get him a new job. Kendra is left in charge, but her along with the other children encounter different scary things. This also results in Madison disappearing. The family tries to figure out what happened to her, but are at their wits end. Carrigan might be the person they need to help figure out what happened.At the time of seeing this movie, I thought this was a pretty good remake at some of the things that it did. I am updating this review without having gave it a rewatch, but seeing what I wrote originally and from what I remember about this movie. There are a quite a few scenes from the original that are reshot in this one, but I do like that they changed these parts up. I'm not a big fan of a shot for shot remake and this one is not one of them for the most part. I do think that something they do well is updating the technology.This one wasn't as scary to me as the first time I watched the original. It could have been my age and not knowing what to expect that influenced me. Knowing the plot points I think is a part of why I didn't find this as scary. Also being a remake does hinder this one, because the story aside from being updated slightly, it is pretty much the same as the original. I also kind of felt that the ending was a bit rushed as well as it took a long time to get to the climax. It is a bit predictable as well.Something I did think that was good though was the acting. I'm a big fan of Rockwell and I thought his performance was pretty solid. DeWitt I also thought was good as the rock of the family who is there trying to get everyone together. Sharbino did fine as the angst teen daughter while Catlett was the terrified child of the family. I do think he overplays against the original. Clements I already said is full of life and I think she does solid as the updated version of Carol-Ann. I'm also a fan of Harris and thought he was good from what I could remember.The one thing that did stick with me is that this movie decides to show us where the daughter is being held. I do know it was CGI heavy, but I still remember enjoying showing this to us as the audience. I do really need a rewatch of this to see if it holds up now or not.With that said, I still feel that this film is worth a viewing. I personally didn't feel it was as scary as the original. The acting is good and the story although not original is updated to the times and has made some changes. This is a pretty solid haunted house film that is enhanced by the horror of involving children. The film wasn't as scary as I wanted, but that could be me knowing what would happen. This one didn't have any surprises for me, which was a bit of a disappointment. I would recommend at least giving this one a viewing.6.5/10"
" They're heeeeeeere
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"When I saw the original Poltergeist, I wasn't really that scared by it. The remake, however, nearly made me pee my pants. My heart was still thumping as I left the theater. I did enjoy that there was a reference to the original. (""What's happening to you happened to another family back in 1982""). It was also interesting how they managed to make it modern day, yet still keep some elements of the original. (The family just moved into the house, and doesn't have a cable box yet, so of course there's static on the TV). You know that feeling you get where your stomach drops when someone sneaks up behind you? That happened to me several times. The only problem was Sam Rockwell's horrible acting. He has no emotional range in his voice and sounds very monotone. He's very boring to watch, and almost ruined the film. However, everyone else did a great job.
Grade: B. 8/10. 4/5 stars."
" Just stop doing remakes of great 80s films
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,2,Ummmmmm I just...... ok 1st (or maybe 5th) why didn't they seem completely freaked when the little boy was sucked into the tree & the older sister got grabbed by a hand out of the ground & then was shock (but only a little when she found out that it was on burial ground & that's just the least of it. It was awful!!!!!
" Good movie , Good Acting. 8,5
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,9,"Good movie , Good Acting.Good actors, ..Good ending, and it will make me watch movies rated 4.9, even more , cause apparently most of the people who write these rewiews don't now a thing about movies..I like horror movies, and this movie is not the best , but its a solid 8,5."
" Totally unnecessary remake
",2020-02-19 00:00:00,3,The 3 stars I gave goes to the 1st 30 minutes. That means the rest of this production is really annoying.
" Just OK
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,5,"This was not nearly as good as the original. I don't understand the desire to remake a classic such as the 1982 original. I love an updated, or an improved, or even a reinterpreted remake but when the original is flawless, well, I just don't get it. That's like remaking The Shining, or Little Big Man. Why, oh why? Anyway, IMDb was a bullseye on this one. A 5.whatever. Family man loses his job with John Deere and moves his family into a kind of icky house in a kind of icky neighborhood. In real life the only icky factor is that the house needs to be painted and cleaned up. That is until the poultergoose shows its ugly multiheads. The evil spirits take the youngest member of the family, the little girl, and don't want to let go. So our protagonist hero family must band together, with the new paranormal team working for them and the TV paranormal star's help they try everything they can to get her back."
" Only watch if you haven't seen the original
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,2,"I give any film a fair crack of the whip but because I know the original so well it ruins it for me to view this later version, the original version is superior in every way and thus the remake doesn't even stand a chance, but give it a watch or switch it off after 20 mins and agree with me."
" Terrible!
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,2,The clown from the poster wasn't even in it! Ripped off! Worst movie ever.
" One of the better remakes I've seen.
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,10,"This is a really good remake in my opinion. The story was successfully updated to modern day. The acting is very good, especially the two actors that portrayed the parents. They had really good on screen chemistry, and that really helped the story run smoothly.Don't count this movie out just because there is a stigma that ""remakes are bad"". Because that is definitely not the case."
" It's worst than the reviews here
",2019-12-19 00:00:00,1,"No review can tell you how bad it is. Bad acting, bad story, bad effects, bad remake, boring, predictable, pointless.
If you really wanna watch this... Go out, do something else until it goes away, really."
" A poor remake of the great Spielberg creation.
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,1,"While the original Poltergeist had us gripping the movie theater armchairs, this one in not only bland, unimaginative and bords on plagiarism. Don't loose your time, even if there's nothing else to watch. Watch the original again ; it will please you more.I wonder why producers dump their money on these garbage pieces."
" Poltergeist
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,3,"They say you should never remake a classic. The original Poltergeist from 1982 was written by Steven Spielberg who also seemed to have had a hand in how it was directed.The 2015 remake is a soulless movie that brings nothing new to the table except a few jump cuts.If it was an innovative reimagination whose reach could not exceed its grasp I might had been more forgiving.Sam Rockwell is an out of work father, Eric Bowen who with his wife Amy Bowen and three young kids move into a new home. The house was built in an old cemetery and the bodies were supposed to have been moved but only the headstones were.The youngest daughter Madison feels a presence, the spirits below the house need a guide and Madison is sucked in and disappears.The Bowens call on paranormal psychics Dr Brooke Powell (Jane Adams) and Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris) to get her back.The only thing to note is London born Jared doing an impression of his Irish father Richard Harris."
" That boy just can't act! Poor remake.
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,3,"Poor remake. Zero real scares. Nonsensical reactions from the family.
The young boy just can't act ....or was badly directed. Just widening the eyes a little and walking everywhere tentatively in slow motion steps isn't convincing anyone. He walks through most of the movie like this and it became really annoying very quickly.People see the most shocking things and then don't even mention it!?Whomever wrote the script should be ashamed of themselves. Truly terrible.
Totally unbelievable characters and reactions. Plot holes and stupid dialogue.Watch the original.One plus.
The 3D was great fun. (If a little forces at times)
Blatant cash in that fell flat on its face."
" Crappy Carbon Copy
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,3,"An absolutely pointless remake of the classic collaboration between Tobe Hooper and Steven Spielberg. The three stars I gave this are strictly for Sam Rockwell's acting chops. Nothing else and I mean nothing else works. The kids are annoying., the mother is forgettable and the poltergeist hunters are dull. Terrible special effects that are crappy CGI copies of the groundbreaking original movies' practical effects are everywhere in this dumpster fire. Forget this and watch the original classic."
" Wooden acting
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,1,"Probably the worst movie remake I've ever seen. Poltergeist the original movie was one of my all time favourites but this remake is a shoddy bad version of a cult classic. The characters all look like they're reading from a script and don't seem to have any enthusiasm or believability in what they're saying or doing. Very shallow family that seem scared one minute but then cracking poor jokes the next like nothing even happened. Special effects were good but apart from that, no scary bits and no reason to watch it. Disappointing"
" 2 stars because I managed to watch it till the end
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,2,"Awful film. As remakes go this ranks amongst the worst. How did Sam Rockwell end up in this drivel. By the way, he is one of the worst actors in it, probably due to the shame of signing up for it. In fairness, the trailer looked bad so I wasn't expecting much. I wouldn't waste your time with this movie but you may be curious like me."
" Atrocious acting.
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,1,No emotion from the parents about losing their daughter or from the siblings. Just absolutely terrible!! Only convincing acting is from Jared Harris. Rewatch the original if you wanna enjoy poltergeist.
" So stupid
",2019-08-16 00:00:00,1,"So it's a known fact that if your child disappears, you don't call the police, you call some hippies with some cameras. It's also a known fact that if these hippies attempted to kill the ghosts in the house and get the daughter back, then you would let the other 2 children participate.... LOL The stupidest movie ever."
" The remake no one asked for.
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,1,Sam Rockwell is a terrific actor but not even his presence helps here. Awful movie.
" Just don't waste your time
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,2,If you have never seen the original then this movie would make no sense. It's so stupid that I couldn't finish watching it. The acting is horrible and it jumps all over the place not explaining anything. Sometimes remakes aren't worth it!!
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,2,"Great acting by Sam Rockwell as usual. I thought the young girl did a great job too. a few scary parts. and this movie made me laugh, a lot. these are the things I enjoyed about this movie. other than that, yeeeeee. I was wondering if it was a comedy at times. Like, I laughed a LOT. it didn't feel like a scary movie at all. so many illogical reactions and decision making (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
the explanation of ""here and not here at the same time"" was hysterical. she used two papers with a circle on each, placed them on top of each other and held them over the light. smh, worst explanation ever. And at one point the priest was on the floor and I don't know why, I'm guessing bad editing job after taking some scenes out of the movie"
" Poltergeist is one remake that should remain in its ancient burial ground.
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,3,"Why would someone choose to remake the fantastic original? It would be near impossible to replicate/improve on the Hooper, Spielberg and Goldsmith ethereal dream team. Both frightening and emitting that accessible Amblin magic. Kenan's ""interpretation"" is essentially Poltergeist for the smartphone generation, and it sucks big red clown nose balls. A family reluctantly move into their new house, to which they start experiencing paranormal events, only to realise they moved onto of an ancient cemetery.Comparing this would be unfair, so I'm just going to conclude by saying watch the original instead. Please. Just do it. As a film on its own merit, it's littered with flaws. The horror is entirely absent. So much of the budget was spent on depicting this low-resolution spiritual world, that Kenan evidently forgot he was directing a horror film. We got jump scares, ranging from a rabid CGI squirrel to the wife gently placing her hand on the husband's shoulder (oooh scary!), and naturally we have no build up to these ""scares"". The severity in the lack of tension is quite astonishing. Really! It's like watching a family blockbuster! ""C'mon 5-year old son who I have yet to name, let's watch Poltergeist!"".The infamous clown sequence, whilst completely out of place in this remake, was probably the most notably chilling scene. But the legendary ""they're here"" quote and the impending tree sequence were just fluff. They held no substance. Atleast DeWitt and Harris gave functional performances. Rockwell looked like he just got out of bed, he cared that little. And the child actors? Urgh. Bring back O'Rourke (RIP)! Whilst it could've been far worse, the overwhelming sense of pointlessness looms over this tamely dull remake. ""They're here""? Poor suckers, return back to 1982, I promise you'll have a better time!"
" Terrible
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,2,"What a let down. There are some movies that you should not try to remake. They failed miserably with Psycho. They failed with this attempt at remaking the classic Poltergeist. It's not scary, too fast paced, unbelievable characters, and lacks the minds of Spielberg/Hooper at the helm to give it life.
The film is boring. You can go and make your supper, come back and nothing much would have happened.
Watch the original instead from 1979."
" Very Bad
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,3,"This director didn't do anything to add new element to this movie, this remake proves half as haunting as its titular spirit."
" Wish I could give it zero stars
",2019-02-08 00:00:00,1,"Watched this movie because I love horror movies and I enjoy the original. My hopes for a rebooted poltergeist movie died with this movie. The movie relies solely on the hopes that CGI and and reception of the original would make a good movie-no story at all. The characters are pale imitations and you go through the entire move without knowing or caring about them. To say it fell short would be an over statement. Not scary, not interesting, do not waste your time."
" Why did they bother?
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,2,"Say what you like about Steven Speilberg, but he knows how to construct a spellbinding story.
This remake has none of the magic that made the original so compelling. I kind of tuned out a few minutes into the film, when I saw one of the children look at horror images, on a tablet.
Why did they bother with this remake?"
" WHOSE MY SUPER BOY?
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,9,"If you are like me, you already know the plot and will be menatlly comparing this film to the classic. Eric (Sam Rockwell) gets laid off as a quality inspector for John Deere. His wife is going to write a book. They are downsizing their home and moving into a community that already has a lot of foreclosures. Apparently he didn't need a bank loan. We know the drill, cemetery, power lines, ""Poltergeist"" mowed into the lawn (opening sequel) but no swimming pool.Their son Griffin (Kyle Catlett) is afraid of his own shadow and sleeps in the attic with left over clown dolls and wild squirrels. Kennedi Clements plays Madison, the little girl. Personally I preferred Heather O'Rourke.In our update, the poltergeist have a plethora of electronic devices to haunt and it seems modern smart phones have a app to locate them. Rockwell plays his typical semi-disagreeable character. Zelda Rubinstein has no equal so they opted for a TV show tough paranormal hunter (Jared Harris). I enjoyed the special effects and the use of the sound track. It was a professional production, not some ""B"" movie hack job. I enjoyed the film, even though you may not.Guide: Use ""Effin"" instead of F-bomb. i.e. ""Big Effin Squirrel"" Rosemarie DeWitt in sad underwear, Sam Rockwell in happy underwear. Saxon Sharbino provides some eye candy for the male teen. No Jobeth William rolling on the ceiling in her panties."
" Pointless
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,1,"It's a luke warm and shallow attempt of a horror movie. There's never any sense of tension or genuine scares, despite a few stylistically updated nods back to the original. The characters are uninteresting with no chesmistry and they all struggle with a clunky script and a formulaic story. Also? There is way too much CGI which is distracting and never imposes any sense of menace!"
" Absolutely laughable!
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,1,"Don't get me wrong, I adore films. Of many different genres and styles and as a 45 year old I've watched a huge amount over the years. The one thing that I can't stand though is cr*p. And let me assure you this film is exactly that.
I honestly don't know where to start, but the whole premise is a joke.
Obviously the previous 9/10 star reviews are from viewers with no concept of what a superb supernatural/horror film entails.
The characters are totally unconvincing as a family unit and the acting is purely laughable! Zero suspense and even less scare factor. I've watched the original and for those that have - I think that you'll all agree it haunted and stayed with you...
RIP Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper, John Carpenter and George Romero - the true masters"
" So Disappointing
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,3,It's just too obvious. Poltergeist is a classic film that has shocks. This has none. Such a shame. Had high hopes with better special effects an all. I got a bit bored.
" Worst Classic Remake Ever!
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,1,The director should never be allowed to get anywhere near a classic movie like this again. He took away every bit of charm and character of the original. The only actor that wasn't completely horrible was the son. It was rushed w barely a nod to the original. As a Huge fan of 1982 and Spielbergs genius this is a joke w not one bit of redeaming value.
" Excellent Story!!!
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,10,"Gill Kenan and David Linsay Abair show their excellence of writing and directing in this spine-chilling remake of the 1982 movie, ""Poltergeist"". Terror and fear of the unknown are projected into all aspects of this film, by using dramatic irony, and other aspects of horror such as suspense and setting. The story starts with Amy Bowen (Rosemarie Dwight), Eric Bowen (Sam Rockwell), and their three children Kendra (Saxon Sharbino), Griffin (Kyle Catlett), and Madison (Kennedi Clemments) all searching for a new home in the suburban area. The family soon finds a home they like and decide to look inside. The parents love the house and the kids love every single room. Madison and Griffin experience paranormal activity as soon as they move into the home. The spirits use Madison as their way of getting into the house, so they can escalate their attacks. Griffin, who is much older than Madison, notices these events immediately. He tries to tell his parents, but they think he is just paranoid. One day while the parents are out to dinner, they are told that the land their house is built on used to be a cemetery. They are startled to find that only the headstones were moved, and the bodies still lie under the property. The spirits are now lost, and the ghosts are looking for revenge. The parents then realize their son was telling the truth, but it is too late. Madison is now being held captive by the evil spirits and the family must come together to rescue her. Kenan and Abair stay true to the theme and produce an interesting plot that keeps viewers on their toes until the very end. 
The combination of setting, music choice, and special effects all add up to a truly terrifying atmosphere. Writer David Linsay Abair made sure to keep some iconic elements in the movie such as the famous excerpt ""They're here"" from the original. The choice of sound effects are used in a way that creates suspense through noises such as creaking floorboards, footsteps, and laughter. Production Designer Kalina Ivanov, truly knows how to create an unsuspecting environment where it doesn't seem that anything bad would happen. The special effects, shown by Nicolas Martin, simulate a terrifying world that no one would ever want to be in. The actors that were cast really know how to react to what is happening and show the horror they are experiencing through emotion and expression. All elements of this film show viewers what a horror movie is all about. The production team and actors truly knew what they were doing, making the movie extraordinary. 
This film keeps its elements of horror all the way to the very end. When viewers think everything is over and resolved, more conflicts occur, one including death. The family gets help from paranormal investigators, so they all collaborate in getting Madison out. Griffin decides to take matters into his own hands and goes into the underworld to retrieve his sister. Both characters make it out alive, but spirits still hover around the house and one member of the paranormal team must go back into the underworld, and unfortunately does not make it out alive. In the final scenes of the movie, the family searches for a new place to live and is shown a similar house to their old one. They immediately leave, and it gives viewers a sense of relief. All in all, ""Poltergeist"" deserves plaudits, and is one that horror movie lovers would enjoy."
" Terrible
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,1,"The characters are all wrong, the dialogues are all wrong, it screams poorly scripted, no emotional connection could be seen between one another. Scenes were badly shot. I could tell how badly staged some of their stunt scenes were. This movie is poor at best. Don't waste your time."
" Terrible
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,1,"Bad, bad, bad....
No talent, no soul, nothing added to the original and no interesting new take or re-imagining.
Wasted opportunity.
The comic ending was an insult!
Avoid - watch the original which is a real film gem."
" This film is absolutely atrocious!
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,1,"To begin with the cast is terrible! Nobody has any chemistry and you get no real sense of actual family life. 
I didn't get one feeling of a connection between anyone or actual decently acted sorrow, fear, desperation etc etc.
I think the weakest role was that of the mother. In the original she shines through beautifully and you get such a lovely mother/daughter relationship. You can see the chemistry in the original between the mother and father and they actually look in love, where as in this it's incredibly stale.I like Sam Rockwell but this is definitely not the role for him! He feels very much out of place and we know he is capable of so much more. It's a real shame because Craig T Nelson was fantastic as the father and really felt like a man trying his best to do what he could for his family.As usual the CGI is crap and unnessacary, it adds nothing to the film and gives away far too much. They show way way to much of the other side and I really think it was used as a crutch for all the action.There's very little music, it's photography is boring and leaves no impression.They have changed so many good aspects about the original, like the fact that the spirits were infact innocent people who had reached out to Carol Anne because of her ability. The brother some how felt like the main character of the film and took again away the connection between the parents and thier youngest daughter. 
The scene with the boy's braces worked so well in the original and the moving chairs etc. We lost all of that in this crappy remakeThe action scenes are awful and they showed their hand immediately by making the house seem scary and eery to the son. I don't see how you can make a bog standard beige house scary just by hasving cuboards, trees and hall ways but that's what they have attempted. It's crap! really not worth watching and it left you not giving a damn about what happened to any of them."
" WTF just happened?
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,3,"This movie startet actually pretty okay, at least way better than I expected. For around 45 minutes I said to myself ""This isn't so bad. That's a solid 6.5."" Okay, there wasn't happening much, but that's not a bad thing. You keep the pacing slow and than some strange things start to happen, until the girl disappears and the family decides ""to call someone"".
But instead some freaky, weird and maybe creepy lady showing up, there just came this drunk fella, pissing me in the face for 45 minutes. This became so absurd in a bad way, so dumb dialogue, so unnecessary scenes, so never ending stoned / drunk Sam Rockwell, that I can't imagine how this was green lit in the first place. Filmed. Produced. Showed in cinemas. I mean: What the heck? Did someone even bother to read through the entire script?!But there's one good thing about this pile of horse rubbish. I realised what is the problem with all those (remakes of) modern horror films: They don't take the subject seriously. They don't buy their own stories. There isn't the same sense of wonder and believe in occultism, that has been in the late 60s, 70s and maybe early 80s. That's why they produce such mindless bull crap.Seriously - don't watch this."
" A lazy and ambitious film.
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,3,"This movie might just be a remake, but it's not. In fact, it seems to have taken very little from its predecessors in title. The script is banal: as it has happened in thousands of films before, a family with children moves to a new house, acquiring without knowing the (not very encouraging) possibility of being frightened by an endless series of ghosts. Of course, children will be the preferred target of these ghosts, be it by the ingenuity or the effect that this can provoke in the public. Nothing new here. Equally unoriginal (we've seen something similar in ""Insidious"" or ""The Conjuring""), the wardrobe in the girl's room is the most active place, eventually ""devouring"" one of the children. I will not talk more about what happens in this movie so I will not spoil. I just wanted to demonstrate that the film is a succession of cliches.Gil Kenan's direction proved to be poor, fragile and did not seem to have been able to ask for the best of the actors and staff members. A lazy direction, which is content with the medium without pursuing excellence. The scares are scarce and predictable: objects that jump towards the display, snoring, scary noises and lights. I can say that I never felt truly frightened while watching the film. About the actors what can be said is that they seem to me to have tried to fulfill their role well, but they were not directed effectively. Sam Rockwell and Rosemarie DeWitt fulfilled their roles, while the children (especially Kennedi Clements and Kyle Catlett) seem to have fully lived up to what was asked of them. Jared Harris and Jane Adams do not seem to have been good choices, a complete casting error.This film is a far cry from the quality of the Poltergeist of the 1980s, and I do not know if it's honest to relate these films to this movie. This seems a bit too ambitious, even though they share the same name. Despite this, I have the feeling that it would have been better with a more creative script and a more demanding and skillful director."
" Not nearly as effective as the original.
",2018-06-11 00:00:00,3,"Director Gil Kenan is relatively new in the director's chair, and unfortunately it shows. This modernized telling of the classic original is neither scary nor convincing. The acting was merely ok and the effects so-so. I'd rather watch the original ten times over than to watch this remake a second time."
" Incredibly Shameful
",2018-05-17 00:00:00,1,"I make an account juat to express my disgust with this movie, i cant believe Sam Rockwell read this script and accept to act in it. 
The movie it so.. SO careless about the story that its almost a joke, look, they have real serious problems with a poltergeist, their daughter/sister has been caught by ghosts and they act like she is in school, the older daughter even make jokes and looks more excited about the tv guy than worried about her sister, the mother has no feelings at all, the paranormal team has zero effect to the story NONE!! They cameras, sensors, laptops, gps FOR NOTHING!! They are useless.
The story happens so fast that the director dont even care to justified how the hell or why is this happening. They act so normal that you think, if they dont give a crap about having a haunted house why should I ? They have ghost, its ok, they have a haunted house, oh its ok, they are living over an old cemetery, its ok, the little girl its dissapeared and in another dimension, oh no problem, we are gonna get her easily, nothing impress them. Even in the end, the little girl is getting grab again by the poltergeist, but the father is more worried helping the family to get out of the car. WTF!!
Horrible directing, bad acting, horrible writting, horrible cgi, stupid dialogues, and i can continue all day writing. Terrible.
I say, watch it, so you can taste the real flavor of an horrible, not horror, horrible movie. Really dissapointed. I hope this can be erased of the acting memorabilia of a fabtastic actor as Sam Rockwell is."
" Predictable but enjoyable.
",2018-05-10 00:00:00,6,"I vaguely remember watching the original version of this on television many years ago. The only abiding memory I have is of a little girl mewling 'They're coming,' and a television screen dancing with static. So on that basis, I have nothing much to compare this remake to. It begins with that most frightening thing: the wholesome family unit!Dad (Eric played by Sam Rockwell) is initially something of a twit but we warm to him as time goes on; mum (Amy, Rosemary DeWitt) tolerates everything with a smile; the teen daughter (Kendra, Saxon Sharbino) is constantly bored, growing up to look perfect and is spitefully sardonic and unbearable unless she gets her own way; the young son (Griffin - Kyle Catlett injects a refreshing earnestness into his character) is the best of the lot: un-sporty, polite and reserved, and the little girl (Maddie, Kennedi Clements) is a typical drama student juvenile. No more, no less. The paranormal investigator Carrigan Burke (Jared Harris) called out to investigate livens things up.The encroaching possession elements are handled very well. Apart from the cartoon-ish CGI tree terrorising Griffin, most of the effects in the house are real and physical (the finale very much the exception). The camera pans round a bedroom full of everyone sleeping as all the electrical items crackle on and off of their own accord. There are loud bangs and musical stings. And not one of these things is remotely frightening. What is guaranteed to squash the effect is the almost constant accompaniment of screaming children - which may be something I might be in the minority having any kind of problem with.I would say this is as competent as it can be, with a spectacular finale. It doesn't appear to tarnish the high reputation of the original, but doesn't take any particular risks with the format either."
" Nice movie but....
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,6,"If you did not grow up with the original and are quite new to it, your going to like this new movie. 
The problem is : if you know the original movies very well, you start noticing this very quickly : they made a checklist of scenes from all 3 that they wanted to incorporate into this version. As if they feel obliged to include certain scene's to make it a poltergeist movie. And that makes this remake missed opportunity. 
Remakes...... never saw the reason to. Except making easy money."
" Worst movie in this genre I have ever seen
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,1,This is more of a trashy comedy movie than a horror movie. I wouldn't watch it if you are looking for a good horror movie!
" Bad Reboot
",2018-04-08 00:00:00,2,"If you remember and love the original, DO NOT watch this one. It is pretty awful. Hurried and all hacked up."

Sit a clown doll on the TV while you watch it and it might creep you out..."
" It had potential.
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,2,"So, I watched the 2015 Poltergeist with my sister tonight and it was pretty disappointing. It felt very rushed and it just took itself way too seriously. I felt the nervousness of the director, whoever that may be. I realize they were attempting to live up to the hype, as Poltergeist was a VERY big hit, but he/she needed to relax and take the time to get it right. I won't go into details in case anyone hasn't seen it by now because it took me this long to watch it myself, but the lighting and sound is everything. I liked the twist it had at the end and I liked the idea they had for the drone and the drill, but the rest of the movie doesn't add up to the greatness of those ideas. I really wanted to like it, but it was just trying way too hard and combine that with the budget, which I know they probably had issues with because of how iffy most directors are with one-time movies, it just didn't do well. It had potential, but it sold itself short. If I were to give advice to the director of this movie, I'd tell them to go back to basics and learn film and narrative aspects and to study the original a little further. I really do think if this director had more time and had relaxed a bit, it would've been a much better movie. Living up to Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper, that's up to debate(they're legends and legends are incredibly hard to surpass), but I could be proven wrong."
" I have probably seen worse...
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,3,"If I hadn't seen this, I would not have missed anything. There was nothing special about this movie, it was just flat with no emotion.
I give it 3 stars because the CGI effects were good. Sadly, like almost every remake of a memorable movie, this is definitely forgettable, I hope."
" This movie is terrible!
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,1,"I only saw this one time on TV, so glad I didn't buy the dvd. This movie is a huge mistake. It sucked. It was the worst remake on the planet. It was just dumb, I don't get why anyone liked this. It was nothing like the original, it wasn't scary or creepy and the characters weren't funny in the least. The director of this needs a kick to the face for making such a piece of trash. I do not recommend it to anyone."
" Another remake which isn't worth your time
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,4,"POLTERGEIST is another pointless remake of a classic horror film which they didn't have a hope of improving upon. The only difference between the two films are some artificial changes in which the story is 'updated' with needless modern technology including drones and tablets, none of which adds anything to the story. As expected, it starts out subtly but descends into the usual CGI-augmented nonsense come the climax, and the story in between has no heart or depth at all. The scares are anything but frightening, and the low quality is rounded out by the generally poor performances, from a slumming-it Sam Rockwell (you can tell his heart isn't really in it) to the mildly embarrassing kids, and Jared Harris chewing the scenery. This isn't the worst remake out there, and if you hadn't seen the original I can imagine you might find the story interesting, but for everyone else, it's really not worth your time."
" Remake failure
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,5,As a haunted house movie in it's own right or to anybody who has not seen the original this may pass as reasonable. But as a remake to the Tobe Hooper 1982 classic it falls way short. The characters just aren't deep enough to really care about and the scares are of the cheap variety. The humour doesn't really work either. Glad that I watched it free on TV instead of spending my well earned money on it.
" Inoffensive fun for everyone but the kids
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,6,"This remake of the 1982 Tobe Hooper classic won't make you forget its famed predecessor, but it probably also won't elicit any outrage at the audacity of trying to improve on greatness. In other words, it's a satisfying horror movie as long as one doesn't hold it to the original's high standards.If you haven't seen the original, here's how it breaks down. Family moves into a new house in suburbia, a mom (Rosemarie DeWitt), a dad (Sam Rockwell), teenage daughter, younger daughter, young son. Strange things begin to happen, as they do in these movies. The young daughter disappears, but she seems to be trapped in the television by malevolent spirits. The family contacts a specialist (the great Zelda Rubenstein in the original, Jared Harris here) to help them out.This is not a shot-for-shot remake, and for that we should all be thankful. The parents aren't pot-smoking ne'er-do-wells; dad's just been laid off, and mom's a writer. (Which makes me wonder how they can afford the new house, but hey, I think maybe the fact that there are malevolent spirits has something to do with it.) Gone are scenes like the medium's assistant tearing his face off in the bathroom or all of the kitchen chairs suddenly appearing on top of the kitchen table. There's other, new stuff. It's kind of fun.The movie doesn't break any new ground, though. 35 years have gone by here in the real world, and the effects – though frightening at times – aren't going to bowl you over. The acting is actually pretty good here, particularly by DeWitt, Harris, and Jane Adams. Even the kids are good, and of course the little darlin' who gets sucked into the other world is adorable as can be. Only Rockwell seems miscast. He's best at quirky, offbeat roles, not man-of-the-house roles. This was more of a role for a Greg Kinnear.So while this Poltergeist remake didn't enthrall me, I found it tolerable for a rental. Kind of glad I did not see it in the theater, and the effects still looked good on my TV at home."
" A waste of money seeing it in the theater
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,3,"The only reason I didn't rate this lower is because Sam Rockwell's great; he's a character. A funny guy. Now, this movie strikes me the same as Terminator Genisys: were the filmmakers going for a satire of the original? This wasn't very scary and actually kind of funny. It made me laugh. So, I should say that it was a waste of money for wanting to see a HORROR."
" Was this made for TV?
",2017-05-26 00:00:00,4,"I was a huge Poltergeist fan when i was a little kid and was really scared of the original movies when i saw them on TV in the late 80s or early 90s. It had everything a good movie should have. a good script, good actors, good director... this one had none of those. the actors feel unmotivated. the script was rewritten to add the typical 21century Hollywood movie formula and the director didn't know what he was doing anyway...don't watch this remake... stay with the original! its scarier anyway, even today!"
" Not as bad as everyone said
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,6,"This was definitely not as bad as people said. When I started watching, I was waiting for the worst horror movie ever made, worse than all those cheesy horror films, like The Bunnyman Massacre, and things like that. What I found was actually a pretty suspenseful, decent horror movie. Okay, so they could have laid off the really tacky CGI a little more than they did, that was horrendous. However, the use of suspense was really well done. I had goosebumps, I was on the edge of me seat and I kept chewing on my nails. I shivered, and I was really quite scared.There was quite a lot that they could have done better, that is for sure. There was a lot of things that could be edited, and they could have done tons better on the CGI, as I mentioned before, things like the tree and the ghosts themselves were just really, really terrible. I laughed a lot at some of it, couldn't stop laughing really. It wasn't meant to be funny, but I just couldn't stop laughing.It could have been a lot better, but it also could have been a lot worse. It's really not as bad as everyone was saying, definitely watch this and make your own opinion on it."
" Bad acting, bad cgi, large plot holes and not scary.
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,2,"I can't really remember the original. I do know that when it comes to horror I prefer practical effects over cgi. And this remake has way too much cgi. The old one of course only had practical effects. I still don't remember it as scary though. Except one scene where a technician in horror thinks he's pulling his own face off. This being PG13, we only get a scene where an annoying rude Ashton Kutcher-type-technician gets his arm stuck and is almost getting a drill into his face. Pretty lame.Especially considering the scene just before where it would have been nice if he had been killed by the drill.The acting goes from bad to decent to bad to decent again. And there are plot holes biggger than the one in the little girls closet.For a family that has lost their youngest daughter to angry spirits, they remain very calm, only to break down a couple of times. If I had kids and one of them had gone missing, I would be terrified all the time, unable to eat or sleep.As far as plot holes go, the entire movie is a major plothole, like how a father who was recently fired, can get a bankloan to buy a house.Especially since the mother isn't working How the family can just borrow the ghost hunters car at the end of the movie, only to never give it back and never come back for their own car. How the father with cancelled creditcards can buy expensive gifts for his family. How they're forcing their boy to sleep in the attic,. when he's terrified. How they find creepy clown dolls in his closet and don't get rid of them, even though they scare the boy.As far as the girl gone missing this was done way better in Insidious where a boy went missing the exact same way. And most likely much better in the original Poltergeist movie.If you can live with all these plot holes and some annoying characters, acting illogical in many situations, then you will like this movie. If you want good acting and real scare, watch Insidious instead."
" An Honest Review
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,1,"Have you seen it? No? There is likely a very good reason for that...it stinks.Like nearly ALL the endless remakes and reboots that have been plaguing movie goers for the past decade or so....all this is, is a heartless version of the original.It has no heart.It has no soul.It is a retelling of a film that we all love and cherish...and it adds nothing to the story. It improves nothing but the special effects--which held up very well over time--and in some cases belittles the fans of the original...particularly in the fact that they remade the movie at all, without adding anything clever to it.Like so many other remakes it is a hallow shell of the original."
" Worst movie I've ever seen for real ?
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,1,I actually created this account just to make this review. I've never ever seen such a bad acting Seriously the (Dad) is trying to be so cool all time so it gets embarrassing. His walking like his a bodybuilder and got this rough hard attitude against his family members so its just make you wanna crawl out of the skin AWFUL: Same with the mother absolutely ZERO actress and their dialog are so unnatural like their reading it from a book. Alsom their expressions doesn't fit what they're saying at all.There's not even ONE moment where i even get a little scared all is so predictable.I cant believe they got the permission to do a remake of this (cult movie) Don't see it just keep you're memories from the original MOvie.Im honestly stunned how bad the (Parents) are its like a Joke.
" You got scared with this movie? Really?
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,5,"Poltergeist was a classic and for that, and the time it was first seen, the original was so much better. Hollywood has been failing to create something as good in the last years. It is a bunch of movie loaded with clichés and lack of a good plot to ensure quality. No point asking why people have been enjoying the parodies. You name it! Paranormal Activity, Scary movie, remakes like this one of Poltergeist are so badly made, I can't classify them. It should be totally forgotten. Enough with electricity ghosts, evil tree branches, haunted TVs and toys, it is pathetic to say the least!Not another family to be tormented by the evil spirit. It was good...20 years ago! Now it is all about zombies or the living dead. What the heck is wrong with Hollywood and horror movies producers? There might be a good one out there expecting to be released."
" It Somehow is Worse Than it Looks
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,2,"The original Poltergeist was an amazing work of art. Its effects have shown their age but there is still a beauty to a lot of the effects. The parade of spirits descending the stairs is among the most memorable scenes in cinema and a work of art. The remake, not so much.The special effects have been updated, I can give them that. The problem is there is just no direction to it, no artistry. There isn't really much to set it apart from other generic horror movies, there is your shadow children running around, goopy skeletons, and CGI squirrel attacks, the whole laundry list of generic haunted house movie effects. The big exception that the movie feels like it was banking on is the spirit world that the original could never pull off. And they don't do much better. They describe it as a realm where spacial reasoning makes no sense. If they were to stray from the path, if they were to go up or down, they would never be able to find their way back. Then they cross that barrier, and its a hallway. A hallway of groping goopy skeletons, but a hallway none the less. It feels like you just watched Babe Ruth point to the outfield and then strike out without ever taking a swing.Then their is the cast. The focus of the remake is on the middle child, Griffin Bowen, and he will get on your nerves in a matter of seconds. He is the most cowardly child ever put to film, he is literally afraid of everything. The tree scene that sets the kidnapping of Carol Ann in the original where it tries to consume the young boy, it is that level of fear he has when a branch scrapes the window. The fact that this is the hero just kills all of the suspense as he reacts the same as his sister gets kidnapped by ghosts as he does when his mother forgets to leave the light on. And of course they give him the attic, the scariest room in the house, knowing full well that he has the fortitude of a limp noodle.The family isn't much better. There is a massive problem with modern movies that try to make the cast seem deeper than they need to be. They are given other problems that they are going through and they more than often aren't handling them well. And as a result, they come off as the worst people to have ever lived. In this case it money troubles. They are so deep into crippling debt and are only digging themselves in deeper that they are ignoring all of the haunted stuff going on around them. Hearing them just disregard Griffin as he is trying to tell them of the goings on becomes a testament of frustration as the audience screams at the top of their lungs to move on and get this over with already.The extended cast isn't much better. It was a dick move when the researcher raids their fridge in the first movie, and their steak of all things, but the one in this movie takes it far deeper. Probing a child and all but calling his parents liars to his face is just unacceptable behavior for any grown man. The rest of them aren't very memorable which is especially a problem with David Carrigan. He comes off as just a generic ghost hunting show host which is a shame as the character he is playing was so memorable in the first movie. They just don't stand out among the many shovelware horror movies that are thrown into theaters these days."
" Should not have been billed a Remake but just a New Story Line
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,5,I enjoyed this film probably more so after hearing how many people hated it. Rockwell is a great actor and does a fie job with what he has to work with. But like my summary said if this was billed as a new story line in the Poltergeist franchise I don't think people would have been so harsh. expecting something to top an iconic classic like the original is nearly impossible. As a stand alone film this did have genuine scares and much of it's own story line. If they would have removed some things they purposely copied and gave this a secondary title following Poltergeist (Just an example Poltergeist: Their Back) I think this would have done so much better.
