" Reasonable...
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,7,"Slow, long introduction, it discourages me in horror movies, that I am a fissure ... Horror films do not need long introductions, charismatic characters and a good story are enough, and here everything is reasonable, except photography, with beautiful images of passionate Italy ... More a novel than a terror in itself, except for the appearances of the ""monster"", reasonable..."
" Unusual, quirky, occasionally amusing but always interesting and engaging
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,7,"Unusual, quirky, occasionally amusing but always interesting and engaging film. It may not, ultimately, be as successful overall as the next feature (The Endless) from Moorhead and Benson but well worth a watch. I found some of the humour here a bit juvenile and after a fantastic and bewildering and exciting beginning a rather disheartening and cheap portrayal of loutish and drunk British tourists. The ultimate joke here might have been that the extremely loud and stupid Brits may have been here to replace what might have been Americans in another film for certainly the too good to be true Californian guy here plays it as if he is a caring sharing Englishman. All that aside the budding romance is well played and the creeping awareness that there is far more to this is very well dealt with. I quite liked the film as a whole but did have these reservations that prevented me being totally convinced and then when the film seems to completely collapse at the end it is very unfortunate. All I can say here, however, that nothing could be worse or more childish than the proposed alternative ending seen on the extras."
" Interesting failure. The shabby romance sinks it.
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,6,"Most films in this subgenre founder thanks to their writers' inability to craft a believable, affect romance between the leads. This one is no different. Their flirtation for the most part is shallow, crude, stupid; when everything hinges on the pair falling in love, but the dialogue and scenes are generally crass to the point of juvenile, the film can't succeed.And this one doesn't. Still, each actor has some good moments, and the conceit is shocking but somehow believable. Any horror buff will be used to interesting failures--that's _Spring._ Enjoy."
" ""My Weird Italian Vacation""
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,6,"A decent watch, could watch again, but I don't think I can honestly recommend.As much as I feel like I liked the movie as a whole, the more I think about what it actually is, and it is definitely a better atmospheric movie than it is an epic story or a high paced creature feature.This is a slow burn, hinting at this or that, drip-feeding information until things are just very obvious. While I think a ""Jaws"" approach definitely would have given more punch, the movie opts for a deeper question of ""I see what's happening, but why?"".The movie definitely takes the time to discuss everything in detail, and while the things that would need some explanation are interesting, the movie is filled to the brim with someone's vacation video.Ultimately worth a watch if you're into semi-grotesque semi-horror stories this should be worth a watch, but I don't know how many people are going to come back to watch this one again."
" GREAT ATMOSPHERE.
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,9,"Instantly creates an environment that welcomes the viewer's interest, slowly, yet methodically builds a works a characters that you care about. While the ending was a bit cliche, the ride there was absolutely with it."
" Entertaining but forgettable
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,7,"A lot of reviews spend (in my opinion) too much time trying to analyze films. For me, I have two expectations; 1. To be entertained and 2. To (hopefully) be told an original story. If a movie provides those two elements, then I consider it successful.
Spring is about a 20 something guy who decides to travel to Italy after the death of his mother. Now untethered and hating his place in life, he just wants something different. Once there, he meets a pair of hard drinking brits and travels with them to a small seaside village where he meets a beautiful woman who, as it turns out, is an immortal.
That's essentially where the supernatural ends and the rest of the film is more drama/romance than it is sci-fi/horror.
A lot of reviews talk about her choosing to give up mortality but they missed the point. It's not a conscious choice, her body chooses when the oxytocin is high enough. Basically, IF she falls in love, her body chooses to stay the same and instead of metabolizing the embryo, she becomes mortal and stays pregnant, passing it on to the embryo. That's where the movie got a bit convoluted, but she doesn't give up immortality, she fell in love with the guy and her body gave it up for her to have a life with him. Still, 2000 years isn't a bad run, so...
You could probably write a 500 page analysis of symbolism and metaphor but why? In the end, it's a decent original story, portrayed by talented actors and shot in a sort of low budget manner than keeps it from feeling like it's recycled Hollywood garbage.
The funny thing about this is, although I found it entertaining, I had completely forgotten about it until I started watching it again by accident."
" Excellent movie! Modern day fairytale
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,8,"No spoilers. This is such an amazing movie I can't believe I had never heard of it before. Interesting premise, good acting, terrific inventive storyline. I haven't been this pleasantly surprised with a movie in a very long time probably because I wasn't expecting much from the beginning."
" Boy meets girl
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,6,"It's not going to end up on my all time favorites - but spring has a Style which is somehow original and in any case different to what is usually labeled horror or mystery these days. Maybe cause the love story is the actual focus of the movie, maybe the two Leads play natural and are not hired straight from a model contest and maybe, well maybe, the filming location in the beautiful southern part of Italy transforms an (ir)regular boy meets girl story into something a bit more profound. The finale, usually an action filled Big Bang, came almost sweat and quiet. The excessive use of (dead) animals is something I did not like at all,-1 from a 7."
" Romcom-Italian version of Take the right one in
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,7,"Cthulhu meets Take the right one in meets The (wo)man from Earth aka Italian werewolf in Naples born in Pompeii and waiting for the American white savior bum to realize the true love, as none of the men from the ages and lands compare to that Californian sincerity and easy-talking charm of young and dreamy screenwriter's alter ego. The most horrifying thing about the movie is that it is a realistic take on dating Italian women, who if impregnated need to be catered for the rest of your life (even if she dies) lest they turn into a monster - which her body, not mind, decides based on oxytocin and other suspicious science. Apparently, eating hostile man's te sticles and innocent rabbits makes for a nice source of stem cells. A bit naive and plot-hole filled mishmash somewhat saved by nice on the location shooting, slow art-house style spending time on atmosphere and not dwelling too much into junk stem-cell pseudo-scientific ""explanation"" that is also thrown into the pot, with some hints of redeeming humor makes overall an OK watching experience."
" Lots of interesting build for NOTHING
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,4,"I really -wanted- to like this film, and I did til I got about midway. The whole story starts off with a lot of promise, beautiful scenery, some predictable but totally decent acting... and then just delves into nothing.
Our story begins with a man meeting a beautiful, fun girl with a strange secret she uses a lot of dumb excuses to conceal. It leads you on a meandering romantic venture, which begins to grow stale due to constant twists, teases and allusions... that just keep going. While I feel it's fine to leave ""plenty to the imagination""--- be aware, most of this film is simply a cute romance story. It's nicely done and pretty, but not terribly interesting. The ""reveal"" need not be spelled out in entirety, but there's a lot of build-up for nothing much.
By the time the film is nearly finished, there's some interesting special effects here and there, but it feels quite shallow. There's no elaboration as to why any of the weird stuff is happening, and the plot essentially disintegrates.
I'm a little surprised at how well-received this was, because I found it incredibly disappointing. The romantic atmosphere congeals, as if someone felt they could make a rather bland (though quite cute) love story film ""more interesting"" by tacking on some sci-fi elements without really fleshing them out. Although the pacing is balanced, the nuances and tension just never really materialize into anything exciting. You get some vague weirdness, but it certainly doesn't live up to the Lovecraft comparisons.
I appreciate the concept, but the execution comes off as contrived.
To the point: Fans of standard romance films and M.Night Shamaylan will love it, those looking for something unique will probably be let down."
" Spring - all over again
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,9,"Lou Taylore Pucci - many probably know him or heard of him through the Evil Dead remake. But here he really proves what a good actor he is. Of course he had a really good scrip to help him with that. But still it is amazing what they accomplished. Yes this is a horror movie, but it could or rather can work as a drama too.Just like that - easily done - well seemingly easily done. The dialog is spot on, the characters (two main ones that is), feel as real as they get. Well the outer surface of them that is. I'm not sure how much you know - certain aspects of the story or rather the characters - I couldn't escape knowing about them. As little as possible that is, because I had no idea what our female main character was up to ... which was more than an interesting watch and experience overall. A horror movie with a heart ... but still lots of violence and blood! And some nudity if that matters to you one way or the other"
" Different and fun
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,7,"I liked this movie. I appreciate the reach for something that, at least for me, seems very ambitious. For the love story that that is, I'm not all convinced. I could not believe in those characters, and love stories are all about the characters. In this film they were pretty much underwritten, given basic and shallow personalities and it seemed to be on purpose. They were an Avril Lavigne song all over. He was a boy, she was a girl, could it BE any more obvious? No, Chandler Bing, this is not a rom-com. Or is it?That's the deal with this movie. As entertaining as it was, I didn't know what I was really watching. For me, personally, It needed a clearer focus to be really great.Maybe I had high expectations for it as a thriller/sci-fi/horror movie, because I thoroughly enjoyed Resolution and The Endless, both from the same directors. The romance part of it seemed like a total joke to me, but i'm not mad about it. All in all this is a fun movie, especially if you don't take it so seriously, cause there's a lot of plot holes that I could be nit-picky about. But the story is good and well acted, it is beautifully shot, the cgi is neat, and it has really great and memorable moments.*Spoiler alert*It's a silly observation, that I just need to get it out of my chest. How am I supposed to believe that this girl is a human being that lived 2000 years and does not know how to brush their hair? It really annoyed me the whole time. Was that a wig? It looked like she had a wig on, or very suspicious hair extensions. I guess that hair was a character choice to make a joke? The ""I'm too cool for brushing my hair"" type of girl? Because that's the kind of girl that guys go for in the movies. Anyway, that hair was there, and i did not like it. Towards the end she was having a rough time, so it's plausible, but from the start her hair was not acceptable. If so, that's a bold choice for a joke, and I absolutelly love it."
" One of my favorites
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,"This is one of those films that you just can't lable, in the very best way! I don't know what genre i would put this in, other than transformative. It is instantly my favorite movies. It doesn't shy away from practical effects, it has the best characters I have seen in a very long time. Even their secondary characters were outstanding and I'd watch a whole movie about them. The edits and camera work are superb and never had a bored moment. Could rate this high enough!"
" Completely unexpected
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,9,"I had seen The Endless, so I knew Benson and Moorhead were not the usual horror types, but I had forgotten that Spring was one of their films until I saw the credits.Anyway, I was not expecting this movie at all. As we got into it, I thought it was developing kind of slowly, and when we start to find out the nature of Louise's secret, I figured it was going to be just another vampire-style monster flick.Boy was I wrong! In fact, this really isn't a horror movie at all. It's a romance that uses horror tropes. The story is not actually terribly original: an immortal being has to decide whether or not to give up immortality for love, but the way in which it's dealt with is really fresh, and it comes out in a very unexpected way.My only beef was with the whole stem cell thing. Supposedly, every 20 years or so, Louise has to get pregnant, at which point she absorbs the fetus's embryonic stem cells, and will regenerate into a completely different person. However, if she falls in love, the oxytocin in her system will cause her to use her adult stem cells instead. She will remain the person she is, but she will die in a normal span like everyone else (supposedly she's a scientist and figured this out on her own).Stem cells aren't magic, and the real advances with them have been made with adult stem cells. Bringing the idea of embryonic stem cells into this movie seemed to give it an unnecessary political tilt that comes at the expense of bad science.But we're not talking about a peer-reviewed study here, we're talking about a movie that's operating on a metaphorical as well as a literal level, so we might forgive a moment of maladroitness from the filmmakers.Apart from the fact that it was a little bit shocking to see Louise in all of her slimy, tentacled glory, this film wasn't really very scary. It was mostly kind of sweet and even somewhat uplifting.This could be even be a decent date movie if your date isn't particularly squeamish.Nadia Hilker's performance as Louise is fantastic. She's sexy, and very believable as someone who thinks she's seen it all (she is 2,000 years old, after all). Her performance is subtle enough that by the time she tells Evan that she's not in love with him, we're (or at least I was) justified in thinking that maybe that's not completely true.Lou Taylor Pucci turns in a terrific performance as Evan (but is overshadowed somewhat by Hilker). Evan could have been a very forgettable ""everyman"" type character, but Pucci gives him depth. Evan is despondent after having lost both of his parents in fairly quick succession. He's emotionally shattered, and for the first maybe 2/3 of the movie I was convinced that he wasn't really in love with Louise - that he was just looking for something to latch onto.Usually horror movies make me laugh, and romances make me roll my eyes, but this movie doesn't fit neatly into either genre. The horror and romance aspects blend together seamlessly to give us a picture of of people making great sacrifices in the pursuit of love. Ultimately that's what this movie is about. No one understands loss and grief like Evan, so when Louise makes her choice, you know the tragedy of what she's letting herself in for is not lost on him.This is a terrific film, and could even be appreciated by non-horror fans, if they're not too grossed out by the films messier scenes."
" I want to go to Italy! 🇮🇹
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,8,10/10 based just on the scenery of Italy alone in this film! 🎞
" Best movie!!! Watch it!
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,10,"Watching this in 2020, great movie! I wish lou pucci would make more movies. I really think he's a great actor."
" The next del toro,or Terry Gilliam, WATCH this film!!
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,The combo of these 2 writer directors is scary!! Scary in a great way I just hope they keep their visions and follow their own path and gut instincts cause so far they've made 3 movies that are outright unique creative gems!! This movie is a must see for ANYONE who wants to watch a film that is in it's own category. Why do we have to always label them? Why can't we just watch them and let the film do what all great films must do....ENTERTAIN!!! Watch this gem of a non descript movie!!
" Relationship demons... figuratively speaking?
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,8,"I was simply in awe of this beautifully made, slow-burn romance-horror, which I couldn't stop thinking about long after it finished. The unique touch was its shades of H.P Lovecraft with an excellent monster design interwoven into a naturalistic romance tale. Nothing too over-the-top or even frequent with its monster element, but only minor glimpses and a minor quick thrill here or there. Simply put, it's an intimate and lyrical love story between two very much connected individuals coming face to face with allegorical and bonafide relationship monsters. Possibly leading to tragic circumstances, or undisputed love?One thing though is that you become infatuated by the chemistry shared by Lou Taylor Pucci and Nadia Hilker (who captured my eyes when we see her for the first time in that red dress). Another thing was the whimsical, and heartfelt music score that complements the ongoing moods. Then there's the splendid Italian backdrop, which the sweeping camerawork made excellent use of the many picturesque views.Perfect, textured and visceral low-budget film-making."
" Anothe Benson & Moorhead classic
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,7,"Some damn refreshing script-writing in this film. I enjoyed more than I thought I would - and mainly form a technical perspective - some of the practical and special FX and drone shots int his are fantastic.if you like this film then see the Endless & Resolution for some damn fine film making. One day these guys will make it big with some epic Hollywood blockbuster - in the meantime, just enjoy their films while they are still great!"
" GREAT surprise...
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,10,"Talk about transcending all of the descriptions...they meld into one fantastic, mythlike story...and it starts out in a way that is deceiving to the point where most viewers are probably wondering if they should continue...
i was VERY surprised at the low rating. so i gave it a 10 to bolster it to, at LEAST, the solid 8 that it deserves...
no. it's not 'slasher horror'. so if that's what you're looking for, move along... nothing to see here...
but it does, in its way, earn the description...just not in the 'usual' way...
because that's just it...there's very little that's 'usual' about this film...ok. aSIDE from the romantic part...which really IS at 'the heart' of this film...
but ALL of the pieces are extremely well done...the dialogue...the acting... the photography...AND...the locations...
i couldn't recommend this movie enough to anyone who might think a film categorized as 'horror/romance/scifi' MIGHT be interesting...
find out for yourself...but keep going till at least a half hour...if you're not committed by then, feel free to bail..."
" Surprised Me
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,7,"Interesting concept that caught me off guard, a little slow and corny for the first 30, but stay with it and you'll get a cool little horror/sci fi flick that is original(mostly)."
" A hidden Lovecraften movie
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,10,"I liked this movie a lot. Very original, and the two leads are perfect.
When we see her at her worst, well the movie cuts off before that happens.What I mean to say, the worse we see her is Lovecraft looking. I has read a lot of Lovecraft lately and this fits the bill perfectly."
" Yeah right
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,1,Another 'horror' 'art' film. Watch it if you want to be bored to death.
" ""Women, Jewels Of The World!""...
",2020-03-09 00:00:00,9,"After a family tragedy and ensuing drunken disaster, Evan (Lou Taylor Pucci) quickly finds his life in the proverbial toilet. With the law literally at his door, he heads to Italy on a whim, finding the change of scenery... invigorating. Especially, upon meeting a beautiful woman named Louise (Nadia Hilker), who seems to somehow be wherever Evan winds up. Soon, Evan is captivated, love blooms, and the preternatural terror begins.SPRING is another wonderfully odd, innovative film from Director's Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead. Drawing from several genres, this movie is fascinating from start to finish, managing to be both eerie and touching, without being sappy. The perfect movie for romantic horror / sci fi / monster enthusiasts... Special mention for the Directors' full use of the incredible Italian scenery..."
" This is a slow sweet boil
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,7,"Italy is presented lovingly with beautiful mood music. Though this is really a love story with horror trappings, those trappings serve to make the urgency urgent. So, yes, I liked it."
" Horror Sci-fi
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,5,"A young man takes a trip to Italy and meets a girl. They spend time together over a couple of days, but then he finds out she changes into a hideous creature from time to time. I don't even remember what happens at the end. I really didn't like the lead actor, so that put me off the film right away. Every interaction he had with the rest of the cast was marred by the fact that I didn't want to see his face."
" Great romcom/ horror
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,8,This is almost like a modern version of From Dusk Till Dawn. Starts out as a typical hot headed boy running from the law and then meets girl and they fall in love but that is not case here. The girl has a big secret. This film had a great story and great acting. Not sure why this fell under the radar.
" Cool writing and a nice idea in a romantic fairytale
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,8,"Simple in its structure, Spring offers a romantic story digestible for science-fiction fans and goes beyond to introduce a pinch of uncertainty and a rich brew of good writing. However, if somebody expected a classic horror, they could be disappointed."
" Loved it!
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,9,"No spoilers in this review. This isn't really a horror movie, it's a romantic story with a twist. Perfectly cast, perfectly acted, it's a story that really deserves a sequel in my opinion. The main two actors couldn't have done a better job; they are absolutely believable in their roles. That says volumes for the direction, as well. I'll definitely be watching it again soon."
" Twilight For Men
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,3,"Take a cheesy romance with a not very bright young man and a mysterious older woman. Add insipid dialogue and cringeworthy emotional beats. ""If you loved me, you'd die with me!""--style. I'd blame the script for the lines, but a better actor wouldn't sound like a whiney spoiled brat. Unless we are meant to hate the male lead, and, based on her response, we are supposed to feel touched by their connection.Beautiful backdrops, decent horror flashes, but the love story parts just fill you with loathing by the time its over."
" Moody, romantic, funny, body-horror - Awesome and sticks in your mind.
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,10,"This was kind of a shot in the dark for me (no pun intended), but another review comparing this to ""Before Sunset"" as a romantic body-horror flick intrigued me. It's an entirely appropriate analogy, and the two main characters here are as involving and likeable as the couple in the Linklater trilogy - hell, maybe more so. This also struck me in the way as the European ""Let the Right One In"" did - a great meld of moody, indie direction with fantasy-horror elements and crackling dialogue.It starts as a directionless California punk named Evan travels to Italy to escape his dead-end life (and the cops). The first third is very much a straight hostelling adventure. However it switches gears somewhat when he meets the beautiful and mysteroious Louise who has a very cool but horrifying secret. The soundtrack by Album Leaf is electronic and moody. Highly recommended, especially if you like Richard Linklater, Nicholas Winding Refn, David Cronenberg and Giullermo Del Toro."
" Very intriguing
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,8,This is my 2nd Benson and Morehead movie. This one is a lot like Resolution. Well made and suspenseful. But Nadia Hilker is a criminal. She should be charged with grand theft - movie.
" A Simple Love Story
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,10,"This movie is so awesome.
Thanks for creating this.
Reminding me of a certain feeling in my life."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,6,Pretty good movie with a nice story that kept you invested and some memorable moments and intriguing ideas (1 viewing)
" Another Great Entry from Benson and Moorhead
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,8,"This is an awesome movie. I really didn't know what to expect when I went into it, because I'd gone in blind based on the strength of ""The Endless"" and ""Resolution"". I was not expecting a love story from the two that made those other films, but they pulled it off. Benson and Moorhead not only have something to say (and something worth listening to), but they also have an incredible amount of range. I'll be sure to watch anything else that comes from this team, as I've been consistently impressed with their work. See this film, see their other films, and watch for films from them in the future!"
" Excellent indie love affair, with sci-fi bits
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,7,"I'm not sure why this movie needed the science fiction aspect. As a love movie it was pretty good. The writer had gone to a lot of trouble to make the relationship natural, easy going and highly likeable with a really good script. There were many lovely touches, such as the old man and his orchard, or the light reflecting cave. There was great cinematography going on too, with good romantic locations, and lots of shots of wildlife. The sci-fi aspect was OK intellectually, but visually lacked a defined vision, and certainly the movie needed better cgi/effects department work. I'm a fan of sci-fi and I like to encourage it. Spring wanted to be two things. It succeeded with the love affair. It needed either a rethink for the sci-fi aspect, or a lot more work, and with a better creative director. Another criticism is that the cameras used for Spring seemed to be lacking colour. Was that deliberate? Whatever, I really enjoyed the young love, but scratched my head as to the sci-fi."
" Trash
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,1,"Badly written, badly produced, awfully acted. Total lack of cinematographic touch in delivering the defining moments and the lenghty explanations. A couple of pathetic jokes. The guy reacts in a laughable way when he discovers what's happening. Thanks, oh thanks Guillermo Del Toro for recommending this as ""one of the best horror movies of the decade"". Oh, and I've read every single word written by Lovecraft in his career: though being marketed as ""Lovecraftian"", this story has nothing to do with HP Lovecraft."
" Yeeeees, Springs
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,9,"Before Sunrise and Under the Tuscan Sun, you should Let the Right One In.I almost hesitate not giving this 10/10 stars. Maybe bits and pieces here and there got me down, but that made up for like 7% of the movie. The remaining 93% was amazing.Talk about chemistry, well, literally and romantically. These two leads felt like soul mates and the journey with them, almost perfect. But, backing up...This movie felt so real, even in a fantasy realm. In summary, a poor man's life was circling the drain in California, so why not move across the globe? There, he seemingly repeats his story, but not really. He's got a new love interest. Unfortunately, she's got some 'splainin to do.I wondered hard on how this was ""horror"" as I found this on the horror channel, Shudder and this site is listing it as horror. To me, it has some horror elements, but it's really a drama with sci-fi bits. And great special effects in what felt like an ultra-low budget film.All-in-all, this movie was brilliantly shot, excellently acted, wildly original (even when drawing from other films mentioned above) and the dialogue and back/forth between the characters, both main and minor, was the driving force for me. I looooved the wonderful rapport and quick witticisms. And they weren't overdone. Just enough to make it feel genuine and seamless.Can't recommend this enough, even to non-horror fans...as this really isn't horror anyways.***Final thoughts: No real spoilers, but not sure how I feel about the ending. I knew that's where it was supposed to lead up to, but would've rather had an alternative ending. Also, quick question: how did he suddenly become an all-but millionaire? And finally: Wow, this was made in 2014 and so relevant today concerning immigration and what an eye-opening take on it!"
" If only the ending..
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,3,"This film is alleged to be part of the Lovecraftian horror genre, and there appears to have been some concept work done prior to writing the bulk of the script, which runs much like a Latin soap opera. However the concept work fails to deliver anything that Lovecraftian horror is made of, and even following its own premise, this film falls apart.A 2000 year old metamorph, even with a sketchy memory, would know so much about human behavior, that they would be completey incapable of the histrionic/borderline head games that this girl plays out with the 'protagonist'. She would have to have given herself a total lobotomy to endure such a banal runaround, but she had not, according to her dialog.The main character was perfectly written as ignorant fodder. His fate should have been food for Louise, and his dying screams a satisfying end to his drivel about true love.If this movie had *at least* had an optional ending in which Evan is eaten during Louise's transformation, I would rate this film with 8 stars, because I could watch the entire thing again with my own head canon - a story arc consisting of Louise knowing from the outsdet that Evan is a sacrifice, and the entire brief romance is a game for her; a horrific tragedy for him. That would have been an interesting horror romance.I mean come on! 2000 years of life, and you'd throw away immortality for a drunk american leg-humper? It a bit of an insult to the audience's intelligence, and the alternate ending that is included in the BlueRay confirms what we (and Louise) should expect from Evan."
" Would be 10 out of 10 but for the supporting actors!
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,9,"A truly great watch. There is little in the way of missing elements in this Sci-Fi/romance/horror. It even has the odd moment where you can laugh.Rarely do I watch anything that has 'romance' in the genre, but I was glad that I watched this little gem. It has a good story, builds the characters, fills in the blanks (yet leaves a lot to the imagination) and actually makes you glad you watched it through. I say that because I can imagine folks giving up on it, some story pieces only really fall into place in the latter parts of the movie. It is worth the wait and frankly even the special effects (makeup in particular) are first rate.Synopsis: watch it! It's actually a great movie and the leads are really good."
" A Pox On the Houses of Morehead and Benson!
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,1,"What a rip! Marketing a romantic comedy as a horror flick. The filmmakers should be ashamed of themselves. This was like sitting through Twilight 24 or something. I'm not going to write any spoilers here; I don't need to. My one star review speaks for itself. What started off as an interesting crime drama devolved into a ridiculous love story with pseudo-supernatural elements surrounding it. Every character outside of the main couple had diddly squat to do with the film's progression. They were just there as distractions or fillers to pad out the 90 minutes that is this stinker. BTW, the one star if for the cinematography. All those wide, sweeping shots of Italy were pretty cool."
" Don't Share The Ending...
",2018-10-09 00:00:00,7,"Severely underappreciated film which has been mis-billed as a Gothic horror film. This movie is, quite frankly, in no way, shape or form, a Gothic horror movie. This film is however a beautiful, cerebral, thought-provoking romance which is worthy of more views that it has received. Watch when you can get it all in with one view as this film will engross you and draw you in from start to finish with it's heartfelt story and intriguing characters. If you enjoy romances along the lines of ""Eternal Sunshine"" and ""Amerie"" than this is the next film in that line for you to enjoy."
" A heartwarming horror film
",2018-10-09 00:00:00,9,"Who would have thought a romantic comedy could exist in the same plane as horror. To sum it up, this film left me speechless. The writing was impeccable; I often thought, ""i would have reacted the exact same way"" or ""I would have said that too!"" It feels so real and genuine. I liken this movie to a fairytale in that it captivates and teaches a lesson but not before showing you the atrocities people are capable of. Take some time to watch this, seriously. You have my word, for what it's worth, that you wont be disappointed."
" It will surprise you.
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,10,"This is probably the most beautiful film I have seen in a long long time. Good movies are movies you'll want to see two or three times so that you can relive the excitement of seeing them again. Great movies are movies that stay in your memories forever. You dont need to see them again, you just know how they make you feel every time you think about them. This movie my friends, is a great one. See it."
" I Wanna Know What Love Is
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,7,"This is a difficult movie to review because it is a sad, romantic, mysterious, horrific, hopeful journey through fears of loneliness and death. 
Here's what I liked about it:
The setting was beautiful.
The actors did a nice job in their portrayals of emotion.
There weren't many special effects but the effects shown were not over done of cheesy in any way.
The story was unique.
My dislikes:
The reveal/backstory/explanation for the female lead seemed really rushed. So much so, that I had to go back and view it again to make sure I understood what she was all about. 
There were a few places where I could see what was coming.
Even though it was a slow burner, my understanding was that all this was taking place in a week or so. That didn't make much sense to me.
Overall, I thought it was decent, creative and rather touching movie. Glad I checked it out."
" Very unique and very different.
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,7,"This was really sweet, romantic and mysterious. I loved the subtle way the story unfolded amidst a blossoming romance. I enjoyed lead character Evan (Lou Taylor Pucci)'s back story as well and made the film that much more believable. It was a refreshingly different and unique monster tale. (We never really know exactly what Louise (Nadia Hilker) is, but can only speculate she's some sort of vampire cross breed. I loved the visuals and I loved the dialogue. This is a supernatural film done very realistically, and even harnesses some very deep emotions."
" A Love(craftian) Story
",2018-05-14 00:00:00,9,"This film really surprised me. I walked in expecting it to be 50% horror and 50% romance. Instead, I got a movie that was 90% romance, 5% comedy, and 5% horror. And to be honest, I didn't care. I really liked this movie.The chemistry between the two leads (played by Lou Taylor Pucci and Nadia Hilker) felt so natural. Their performances were both great, and I really bought their relationship. In a film like this, the lead performances should ultimately make you care about their relationship, and ""Spring"" absolutely succeeds at that front.Also, I did like the scenes that did involve horror. Despite there not being that many, the ones that were there were extremely good.The comedy in the movie actually felt extremely natural. This film implemented a good amount of comedy that didn't feel forced or out of place.Finally, this film gave me an ending that I didn't expect. I won't say what happens, but you should watch it. It's great.However, I do have one gripe about this film. There is a scene in the film where a lot of exposition is being given to another character. I do like knowing what's happening, but this expository scene just didn't sit well with me. Other than that, this movie was kinda great."
" DO YOU THINK SHE IS BEAUTIFUL
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,8,"A different type of film, one that crosses genre boundaries. It is a romance first and a sci-fi /horror second. The target audience is perhaps those women science geeks who can watch ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" over and over again.Evan (Lou Taylor Pucci) down on life, absconds to Italy where he bums around until he meets Louise (Nadia Hilker) who throws herself at him. It it isn't long before we know she is different, or sooner if you look at the DVD cover. The explanation of what she is, comes first in subtle clues and unrelated film dialogue which ties everything together, almost like an old Russian novel.In spite of the special effects, the film moved a bit slow for my taste.Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Nadia Hilker, Vanessa Bednar)"
" Treacly and pedestrian.
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,5,"What starts as a nice, but somewhat soft, attempt at smashing the horror and romance genres together turns into a complete mess once the script makes its third act reveal. As the protagonist stumbles onto the truth at the center of the love story the film abandons any attempts at authenticity and shows a disregard for the craft of writing characters and for finding the most cinematic expression in the narrative. Instead it opts for endless, uninteresting dialogue straight out of a twee CW supernatural TV show, or worse, a Twilight film.The filmmakers are incapable of ramping up to anything cinematically horrible, beautiful, strange, or interesting. So instead of cinema, we get multiple, lengthy, awfully written expositions of the needlessly complicated preternatural occurrence at the center of the film, even though they've visually told us almost everything we need to know early on.And the characterization is the worst part of all of this. We are supposed to believe that the love interest is 2000 years old, but she is the least believable timeless character ever put into a genre piece. 2000 years and still all of the communication skills, gravitas and air of a annoying, immature young adult prevail. My forty six year old wife has a deeper sense of the years she's lived in her general air, than this character has in even the simplest line of dialogue or delivery. We're supposed to believe that our young male protagonist is somehow interesting enough to hold her attention, even though he's a just some cookie-cutter nice guy. She's been in and out of human relationships, presumably with some extraordinary partners, for thousands of years across hundreds of cultures, but this guy somehow has the spark? It's all bereft of the most fundamental imagination.The direction is super competent. The photography, while a little flat when it comes to light, is compositionally strong. For the first two-thirds, the film is able to lock down an interesting tone, despite a heavy reliance on some pretty lame images of insects that are supposed to enhance the creep factor and convey nature's strange permutations, or whatever. But I can't stress this enough, the script is really bad. The dialogue can be painful, and the fact that the filmmakers don't know when to shut up and just let their story be told visually, makes for an arduous viewing on the back half of things.I was really excited about the The Endless. The trailer looks engaging. It's interest in that film which prompted me to try this one, but The Endless has the exact same writers, and that dampens my enthusiasm tremendously. Hopefully there's been some growth between the films."
" An atmospheric romantic film with Lovecraftian elements.
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,7,"I saw this on a dvd recently. Wasnt keen on watching this.
Firstly, it is not a horror film n fans of the horror genre will b disappointed.
There is too much chatting between characters but there was something which made me complete the film in one sitting n although as a horror fan i got cheated into seeing this, i cannot dismiss this as a bad film.
This film falls perfectly in the Lovecraftian horror genre. Has elements of science fiction, romance, mythos n fate. The acting by the two leads was surprisingly very good n both the characters were likeable. The only drawback is u dont get to see the monster in its full form but thats not the point of the film. Also noteworthy are some beautifully shot scenes. 
The ending scene was beautifully done with beautiful settings.
To b honest, i dont like such films n will not watch these kinda films. 
One of my online pal convinced me into seeing this. Definitely it is a very good film but not my taste."
" A superb little film any horror fan should give a shot.
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,9,"Tired of the trending, by the number supernatural/zombie/hack-and-slash horror films? This is the refreshing little film you need. I watched the film having no idea what I was stepping into, and I think that's the way it should be watched. It covers a host of disparate film genres and blends them beautifully together ( I don't even want to mention which ones as that itself partly spoils the film in my mind). The film has gorgeous visuals, great direction, and some amazing shots of breathtaking locations in Italy. The films score is composed by electronic musician Jimmy Lavalle, and compliments the film perfectly with its lush and ethereal sounding synths - definitely worth listening to on its own too. With it's amalgamation of genres it's easy to see why the film didn't prove more popular, but give it a watch, and you'll be glad you're in the minority of those who did the same."
" Dark, Modern Day Fairy Tale
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,8,"Ultimately a traditional love story, wrapped in Lovecraft, Spring is a terrific film. Solid direction, top-notch acting, subtle exposition and a unique script make this a memorable experience that begs to be revisited. Nadia Hilker is amazing. At the film's climax, the premise is so ""out there"", that there is no other option but to allow the characters to accept it and dive right in. Highly recommended."
" Quite original, if not fully engaging horror/romance
",2017-12-05 00:00:00,6,"Personal issues make a young man decide to travel from his home in the USA to Italy to escape from his problems. When there he encounters an enigmatic beauty called Louise who has a very strange primordial secret.What you cannot accuse Spring of is not trying to do something a bit different. This is a film which is definitely fairly original in approach. It sort of defies any clear genre definition and is instead an odd hybrid of horror and romance. Sort of like Before Sunrise (1995) with a side helping of body horror, if you can imagine such a thing. It's that age old story of boy meets girl, girl turns out to be a two thousand year old serpent-like being. Don't you just hate when that happens? Joking aside, the premise is certainly something different and it does stand apart from typical horror or romantic movies of late. That doesn't mean that it is an entirely successful film though, I didn't think the overall whole was up to the task of the admittedly original concepts contained within it. I reckon the two leads were partially responsible for this as there didn't seem to be a massive amount of genuine chemistry between them. Lou Taylor Pucci is a little on the whiny side and does tend to gravitate to playing quite annoying characters such as he also did in the Evil Dead remake. It does mean that he is not entirely easy getting fully on board with. Nadia Hilker was definitely better and quite alluring as the pivotal character Louise but, essentially, the chemistry was missing for me. Much better was the Italian scenery which was gorgeous, it reminded me of how few decent contemporary Italian horror movies we get nowadays compared to the golden years of the 60's to the 80's. So it was nice to see an interesting horror narrative play out against the peerless architecture and sun-kissed beauty of this country. The horror is fairly rationed here, with the relationship material very much taking centre stage but there is definitely some impressive moments. Most notably in the big reveal sequence where we see Louise writhing around in her apartment in her primordial form. I thought that the special effects were very good here and created some indelible imagery. In the final analysis, I would put this one down as genuinely worth the time, even if it does fall short on what it could have been. Certainly a film for those who want to see different angles from the horror genre though."
" interesting indie
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,6,"In California, Evan is caring for his dying mom and watches her pass away. He loses his lousy job. On a whim, he goes on a trip to Italy. After meeting beautiful Louise, he decides to stick around and get a farming job. They spend a night together and he wakes up to find her gone. She is suffering from a strange transformation as they strike up a relationship.This is an interesting take on the relationship indie. There are horror elements but they are not played for scares. Her revelation is too revealing and happens a little too early. She needs an earlier scene where she is in danger of discovery. This movie needs more tension. The relationship needs more tension. It's all very low intensity with some good low budget body transformation ideas until the second half. It does bump up the tension but I wish it happens quicker. There is one funny joke and some good atmosphere."
" The only true horror of this is the stupidity
",2017-10-03 00:00:00,3,"Oh, the horror! I love indie movies, I love intellectual artsy movies, and I especially love psychological horror. Why didn't I like this critically acclaimed movie, then?Well, for starters, this movie is offensively dumb, and also in and of itself offensive(but in a dumb way). And it manages to not be particularly entertaining at the same time. Only in this world, in this specific time, with this specific view on women, can this be considered part of high culture, whilst the female equivalent(Twilight) is rightly considered to be what it is; unbelievably idiotic. I can't completely one-star it, because it's execution was original, and it didn't give me a headache in quite the same way Troll 2 did - but the plot, oh the plot! It's the kind of offensive story some drunk dude will tell you at a bar, and because he currently lacks the self-insight that would prevent it, he actually thinks stuff like this is categorized as ""romance"" - instead of the horribly misogynist, weirdly specific fantasy that it actually is. And you try to smile, because you can tell that he's just being self-involved, and not deliberately creepy, and you hope he's the only man who thinks like this. This is the horror movie equivalent of that. And to those that enjoy anti-PC culture and thinks it's hilarious, you will too be bored! It's a soft core angelic succubus fantasy romantic, and since the creators were not aware of the offensiveness, none of it was executed in a particularly blunt or hard-hitting way. As for the rest, (cinematography, music) it is equally meh. I'm not going to get further down to specifics, because there are other reviews for that(both the positive and negative reviews). I'm just going to say that I really did try to enjoy this and find the good parts, since people used to rave about it. But I came away with nothing. If not for the misogyny, I would've forgotten it immediately after."
" A drug addicts wet dream
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,2,"Some okay cgi and pretty scenery. The acting and story was better than Resolution. Although that isn't saying much. Everything else was just drugs and unbelievable moments. I can't believe all the positive reviews. It's like a twenty something man- boy drug addict had a anime-related tentacle poem dream and thought, ""I'm going to make a movie about that!"" There is some attempt at making it ""smart"" with all the science garbage but it just doesn't come together."
" Good (kind of)
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,7,"Interesting. I could have sworn this is a European film. It certainly has the look. The cinematography is gorgeous. If you are looking for a horror movie, forget it. It is a romance. The chemistry between the main characters is very good. However...the storytelling misses the mark. Considering what both of the characters are going through, I needed to feel their pain more. The film is actually quite reminiscent of 'Let the Right One In' which I think did a much superior job of providing the necessary dark creepy angst. The girl needed to be less glib and more mysterious. The guy needed to be more freaked out.This isn't a bad hair day, people."
" Peep This Reviews
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,8,"This is an absolutely outstanding movie. The cinematography is gorgeous, the acting is more than adequate and the story is thoroughly engrossing. It's essentially a rather intense love story. There are certainly elements of horror but they're handled in such a unique fashion. Lived up to the hype I've heard and far exceeded my expectations. It is not your standard horror film by any stretch of the imagination. Something worth seeking out."
" Low Budget But Ernest & Capable
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,7,"The better points of SPRING are very good, particularly the camera work and the dialog. Unfamiliar with these actors but they did an excellent job. The makers of this film are far more deserving of being granted a big budget than the makers of much of the comic book sci-fi in the megaplexes today. Problems emerge with the contrast between the budget and the need to introduce more convincing visual effects regarding the ""transformations"" , i.e., the supernatural aspects of the story. Indeed, the romance and intrigue aspects of the film would have been more compelling if the genre had NOT been sci-fi but; e.g., espionage or crime. Good idea to use the old Italian farmer as balance. Not so good an idea to ""throw in"" the Pompeii footage for filler (or did I miss plot points?). But, hey, I finished watching it - sure sign of a victory in today's age of streaming video."
" Surprisingly original love and horror story
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"I'm not sure I have ever seen a movie like SPRING. It is unique in both being a love story and horror/sci-fi, but without the cheesy parts (although it does have a good ending twist). It is filmed with caring and love and it is something you will never have seen before. If for no other reason, that makes it worth watching, but it was quite good as well.The enjoyment of watching is that the movie will keep you guessing throughout and the characters are quite original. The filmmakers cared about the characters and how the audience would feel as they watched the movie. I was quite impressed with all the care and originality shown throughout this movie."
