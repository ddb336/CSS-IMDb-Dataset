" Fun and Interesting
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,10,"It's fun and interesting to see how Stephen Hawking managed to overcome his disease and live a meaningful life, changing the world for the better."
" Two against the odds
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,"A filmed biography of Stephen Hawking was inevitable. A genius of cosmology and quantum gravity, he was one of the rare scientists to have acquired great public notoriety. Knowing moreover with which valor this exceptional being, supported by his loving wife, resisted the ravages of Lou Gehrig's disease, the novelistic side was guaranteed. It resulted in James Marsh's « The Theory of Everything"", not an exceedingly original work but quite a satisfying one for all that. It certainly deals only superficially with hard sciences, but could it be otherwise in a work intended for the general public? Inspired by Jane Hawking's book, the screenwriter Anthony McCracken has chosen - and rightly so - the only possible angle, that of the personal story of Stephen and Jane, closely united as they were in their struggle against an adverse fate. Thus considered, this ""The Theory of Everything"" proves to be as edifying as touching, thanks in particular to its two actors, Eddie Redmayne, amazing in his evocation of the physical deterioration of his character, and Felicity Jones, knowing how to ally the energy of the fighter to the expression of the unconditional love. Overall, not too much pathos, and even some humor. With such a potentially lachrymal subject, the finished product could have been worse, much worse."

" Great movie ,Great performances
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,10,"Great performances , amazing movie . Eddie Redmayne did an A+ portrayal of Steven Hawking. Overall the movie was touching and great !!!"
" Too superficial over large parts
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,7,"'The Theory of Everything' tells part of the life story of Stephen Hawking in fast forward. The movie illuminates many facets of his life. Unfortunately, the movie does not take the necessary time to let what is shown have an effect, to give it the necessary depth. We mostly scratch the surface and connections must be opened up by oneself or you have to make assumptions. Meanwhile, the story is already moving on to the next stage of life.In a biopic about Stephen Hawking, the subject matter of his illness must not be missing. Here the movie manages to keep the balance between drama and positive/funny moments. There are well-dosed elements from both sides.On a positive note, the acting performance of Eddie Redmayne has to be highlighted. It was really good. His portrayal of Stephen Hawking was authentic and genuine throughout and never seemed forced. The increasing physical deterioration is touching and shows strength to still want to make the best of his life.The movie is interesting, well made and entertaining. Time itself is an important factor in the whole movie and time is also the movie's main problem. It does not take the time needed to tell a story. Rather, it comes across as if it were a stringing together of important life events. But the context is often not recognizable."
" A different biopic about two great human beeings
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,8,"Many people know Stephen Hawking for his groundbreaking discoveries, such as the discovery of black holes or his theory about the Big Bang. Others know him only as the British man in a wheelchair suffering from ALS who communicates through a computer voice with an American accent. James Marsh's biopic The Theory of Everything is about much more than these unique characteristics. While his illness is a strong focus, the film is primarily concerned with the impact it has on Hawking's private life, particularly on his relationship with his first wife Jane. Jane Hawking created the basis for this film with her book My Life with Stephen Hawking: Love Has Eleven Dimensions.Eddie Redmayne is tailor-made for the leading role of Stephen Hawking. Not only does he look identical to the real person in his younger years, but the way he communicates the continual loss of his motor skills is absolutely thrilling. This is why Redmayne's performance is so highly rated, as the illness in the film does not suddenly hit rock bottom from one scene to the next. His performance is especially close when you see that he wants to, but can't. This is especially difficult to watch in the interactions with his wife Jane, played by the great Felicity Jones. The chemistry and love story of the two main characters carries the film for long stretches, in which joy and sorrow are always right next to each other. Their coexistence is also further challenged by the implementations of important supporting characters from family, friendship and care-related backgrounds as the film progresses. It is clear to see that Redmayne and Jones were closely advised and informed by Jane Hawking on the details, as their performances always seem authentic and almost eerily real.In the end, The Theory of Everything is not a pure biopic about Stephen Hawking alone, but is just as much Jane Hawking's story. This is a welcome change, as films about so-called geniuses tend to aim to explore only this and the people directly involved tend to take a back seat. There is a lot of humanity in this film, which makes the person Stephen Hawking very tangible. The respect one has for this man, but also for his wife and family, is enormous. Nevertheless, it would have been just as important to focus more on Hawking's fundamental theories and inventions and not just to address them superficially. After all, the person Stephen Hawking is by no means defined only by his illness."
" Sweet.
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,8,Beautiful.P.S. I treat movies mostly as fiction only even if it's based on real person.
" Life is a miracle and we are the wonders of the world
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,8,"What worked:
The first thing that comes to my mind is the unbelievable and profound transformation of Eddie as Hawkings. It's a very powerful, believable and relatable performance, making us almost believe if he was the real Hawkings. His portrayal is phenomenal and of course Academy award was without a doubt well deserved. The movie is beautifully written, acted and directed, and special mention to the music of the movie. Was it the best movie they year? Maybe not , but still a great movie. An inspiring story
What did not work:
I would have loved the movie more if we were given some glimpse of how great of a scientist he was. We did have some scenes regarding his academic world and research , but more would make it easier to relate to what a genius mind he really was
Final verdict: recommended"
" Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,8,"""Where there's life, there's hope""The Theory of Everything is one of my favourite biopics I've seen.
The very well written story in combination with the amazing acting is wonderful.
Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones really rocked this film, just stunning performances from both of them.
They made you feel all the emotions they're feeling at every moment.The Theory of Everything is funny, it's sad...it's life."
" scenario very very summarized
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,6,"Actors is very good,but scenario very very summarized,
And shuld be short series like 10 episodes or 15 eps"
" Astonishingly beautiful
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,10,This movie is very inspiring. The performances and music are great. One of the finest biopics.
" This should not be in Romance category
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,1,Stephen Hawkins is one of the most brilliant minds of his generation and to show is life as a love story with conflict with god is blasphemy.
" Eddie Redymayne is... special?
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,9,I can't believe how outstanding he is and I am speechless. Other than that Felicity Jones is great but assisted by Eddie. The cinematography is amazing and recently the films I've seen have had brilliant cinematography.
" Female protagonist is the real hero
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,8,"The life of Stephen Hawking nicely presented in front of us, much suitable for people like me who prefers visual language rather than verbal, aka watching movies over book reading.
It truly brings the life of the legendary in front of us. The protagonist did a fantastic role to portray the physical nature and the more surprising fact was about his wife who sacrificed most of her life for this person even after knowing about his conditions, it simply resembles the female protagonists' character in the Tamil film Mayakkam Enna, where the female character is portrayed so strongly than the protagonist of the film because they're the real heroes who're responsible in the making of these real heroes."
" Masterpiece
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,10,One of the finest movies i have seen. Brilliant direction and acting. Stephen hawking would be proud of this too.
" I once bumped into Professor Stephen Hawking while studying in Cambridge
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,8,"I once bumped into Professor Stephen Hawkins while studying in Cambridge. It was 1994 and I was rushing to get the bus when I saw a gentleman in a wheelchair on the pavement in front of me.There are two things I wish I had done at this point:
1. Paid more attention before moving on as it was only on reflection I realised it was him2. Knew what I now know about himEddie Redmayne is fantastic in this role and wonderfully captures what I think must have been Stephen Hawkings in younger years.In the same year of this movies release is The Intimidation Game starring Benedict Cumberbatch, a very similar story to this, and a rivalry between which is the better film started to tread. Both are very good and similar to each other, but the story, directing and acting in The Theory Of Everything pips the win.This is a thinking persons film and so is recommended for all those who that appeals to."
" A Superb Biography of Stephen Hawking
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,7,"""The Theory of Everything"" chronicles the personal life of the renowned physicist Stephen Hawking, who was diagnosed with motor neuron disease in his early age which left him paralyzed for rest of the life yet overwhelmed the world with his work. Rather than his scientific discoveries, the film is more on the personal/ family life of Stephen Hawking, based on the memoir written by his first wife. Jane Hawking, also a phd holder in literature, in her book ""Traveling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen.""The film is more on the perseverance of a wife on holding the family together pertaining to coping the disease which left her husband paralyzed aside raising her three children and carrying her own thesis. In a way the film inspires to battle against the normalcy of life. The film in its way stands an excellent reference work on a great personality. Although it feels a bit slow in its execution, it's a very well made film with excellent performances and a superb background score. People may best remember the film for the excellent portrayal of Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking, but Felicity Jones is no less in her role of Jane Hawking, from whose perspective we watch the film.Rating: 3 stars out of 4"
" Underrated movie
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,10,This is the best movie and the best acting I have ever seen in my life! I forgot that Eddie redmayne (Stephen Hawking) was an actor! Recommend!
" Very beautiful and underrated
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,"Very inspiring, well directed and written and acted, the music made tear up in every note. Amazing biography, not one minute is wasted, and the less dialogue made this movie a masterpiece and legendary, told in a very realistic way not musical and that what I like about it. It's very beautiful and underrated. A must see."
" Depressing
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,6,"Great acting, great movie making...but SO SO depressing.. later on I learned by reading that's their life. Reality is harsh! I cried so much. When jane still decides to marry him it seemed like there's enough love in their marriage but yes 30yrs of taking care of him like a child...well, it's just depressing."
" It's literally the best movie I've ever seen
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,10,"The music, characters, and the atmosphere in this movie is incredible
I've watched this movie 10 times so far"
" Fantastic biopic with incredible acting performances
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,8,I am a big fan of the late Stephen Hawking and I don't know why I put off watching this movie for so long. It's a fantastic look at his life behind the scenes and it adds a great human element to the brilliant scientific genius we're all familiar with. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones acting is absolutely on point in this unconventional love story.
" You wont reget watching this
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,10,This film is a perfect depiction of Hawking's life
" Focuses on Professor Hawking's marriage more than his career. Loved it anyway.
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,7,"It isn't perfect. But I don't think anyone could actually make a perfect biopic ever. The lead cast delivers brilliant performances. It was heartbreaking to see the initial progressions of his disease. To imagine one of the most brilliant minds of our time had to go through all that is saddening.
I just wish it had a better direction and writing. Not that it's bad but could've been better.
Most of the run time shows how Jane support and struggles through their marriage. Now that I think about it, I'm glad they focused on the marriage. Everyone knows who Professor Hawking is. Most people don't know who Jane Wilde is. After watching this movie, I'm thankful to that woman."
" Romantic, Emotional and Inspirational
",2020-09-25 00:00:00,9,"Biopics are always amazing but this one will go a long way!! It's one of those movies which stays with you like forever. Eddie Redmayne completely moulded himself into Stephen Hawking!!! Brilliant display of acting. Truly deserved his Oscar.But it's all possible because of THE man himself, Stephen Hawking. One of his quotes which he impersonated in life ""While there is life, there is hope"" is also pretty much the essence of the movie. It inspires you, although you feel sorry for such a Genius brain of his to have a life of such discomfort and problems. You'll start to value your life more, right after completing watching the film.The love story is also beautifully portrayed and seems natural as you can relate very easily and feel good that even for geniuses like S. Hawking, asking a girl out is as tough as for you !"
" Decent-ish
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,6,"1.Jane cheats on Steven. But is is made to look almost like the victim as she took care of Steven, big sacrifice and so on. Like she was not warned by EVERYONE beforehand repeatedly2.Steven feels the distance between his wife and himself. Steven accepts the attention from another woman.3.Oh and Steven did some science things (technical term) in this movie.... apparently"
" Love story
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,5,It is a love story of one of the greatest minds of our your time. The movie it is just ok but the performance of Eddie Redmayne is excellent.
" Great love story
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,8,"Its a very great and romantic love story
It shows that love isn't just physical or short term happiness
Or spending the rest of eternity together
Love is bigger that this, its respect and understanding
Its caring about one another
However the movie have some holes, like the ages as the characters dis now grow old what so ever, even though their marriage lasted for 30 yrs
Also its a shame that they did not include a part of his kids, as I am sure that they had a great influence in their parents relationship
Moreover, at the end of the movie it said that Jaine got happily married
But so did Steven as he married his nurse Ellen and he stayed nest friend with his ex wifeOverall, worth watching"
" Touching

" Mind-blowing performance!!
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,9,"This biopic is just brilliant and the performance of Eddy is simply superb. No wonder he was awarded the Oscar. More than the life of Stephen Hawking, it is the journey of Jane Hawking, beyond doubt, is impossible to imagine. Just a wonderful biopic, everyone should watch!!"
" idol
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,7,Happy to see my childhood idol's biography movie. It could be better but at least it helped people to know Stephen Hawking more than ever. It could be more dramatic but movie was focused more on the outcome of events.

" Masterpiece
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,10,"Turning someone's life into a film is as common as it is difficult. Trying to stay true to the story and, at the same time, leave it thought provoking for the viewer is a challenge faced by the biographies. In this take, it was Stephen Hawking's turn to have his career told by the seventh art. Directed by James Marsh, The Theory of Everything does justice to the physical and presents us with an immersive story of love and overcoming.The film features a young Hawking (Eddie Redmayne), who is at the peak of his academic life and starting a romance with young Jane Wilde (Felicity Jones), when he discovers he has a degenerative motor disease at age 21. Thereafter, Stephen and Jane have their love tested by something that, until then, was considered a death sentence for those receiving the diagnosis.There would be no better actor to play Hawking than Eddie. He deserved all the merits he has been receiving for his incredible interpretation, which goes far beyond physical characteristics - very well incorporated, by the way. Redmayne allows us to know Stephen far beyond the physical, humanizing him to the point of making the viewer feel intimate with the character. He manages to convey Stephen's feelings and emotions without the need for much dialogue, but through subtle gestures and looks. This, in fact, is one of the assets of the feature. Despite occurring in large quantities, Theory has its true culminations in brief conversations or even words. One of the most touching scenes, for example, has a ""thank you"" as its main line.Felicity Jones is also noteworthy for composing a strong and determined Jane who does not allow herself to be shaken by the progress of the disease or the negative predictions of doctors and faces everything and everyone to show that Stephen could have a normal life. She and Eddie work well and are convincing in the role of the young couple, thrilling the audience with subtleties. Stephen and Jane's marriage and the way they both struggled to build their family despite adversity is told in a short but detailed sequence of scenes. The impression we have is that we are watching a home video that shows the story of both.The film is realistic and does not try to alleviate the difficulties faced by both, but seeks to show that, contrary to popular belief, life is not limited to problems or a disease and it is possible to see positivity even in the most negative situations. It can be said that The Theory of Everything is a film about life and also about love and overcoming. It is not about telling the story of Stephen Hawking, but about showing how a woman's willpower helped him not to give up and overcome himself.The figure known to the public and his greatest achievements are an integral part of the narrative, but not its center. It is not a matter of exposing the story of someone remarkable on the big screen, but of showing how two people managed to build a firm and lasting relationship - it was almost 30 years of marriage - despite all the adversities. Before being a film about Stephen Hawking, Theory of Everything is a film about the human being in himself and how it is possible to overcome himself daily.Also worth mentioning is the great soundtrack by Johann Johannson, which brilliantly leads the story and is easily one of the best of the year. The script, however, runs at certain times and even leaves some loose ends, but nothing that harms the sequences in an extreme way. The feature film delivers what promises and delights the viewer, introducing him to the man behind the genius and the woman who helped him get there.I liked this criticism of CinemascopeFilm seen on July 8, 2020."
" The Theory of a love story 8/10
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,8,"I believe this is the best romance movie that is based on a true story. James Marsh the director did a marvelous job, the score composed by Johann Johannsson is remarkably beautiful. Eddie Redmayne gives the performance of his life as Stephen Hawking. Felicity Jones is incredibly talented as Jane Wlide. The movie's tone is beautiful and well made, I got attached within the first 20 minutes of the film. There are many other movies based on a true story that have a romance between two characters, in which one of the characters suffers from a disease: 'Breath"", ""I Still Believe"", ""The Fault in Our Stars"" etc. But ""The Theory Of Everything"" tops everyone because of the chemistry between the characters and how their emotions drive the movie and make it shine."
" Where was Felicity Jones' Oscar?
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,8,"POSITIVES:1) Felicity Jones is breathtaking in this film. Redmayne gets all the praise, and he is amazing, but Felicity Jones blew me away here
2) The chemistry between Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones is absolute perfection
3) When Hawking is still normal, I wasn't too impressed with Redmayne's performance. However, once Hawking's disease starts to take its toll, Redmayne's performance becomes completely fantastic
4) The film really isn't about Hawking's science, it's about his wife Jane. To that end, there are some incredibly emotional moments in the film
5) Charlie Cox has a supporting role in the film and he's magnificentNEGATIVES:1) The main negative of the film for me is that the film is just so incredibly quaint and wholesome. There is absolutely nothing resembling grit or darkness in the film and for me that is an issue because it makes the film come across as almost sickly sweet at times. For example, the score is always either pottering along in a very quaint way or swelling to create the sense of life affirmation and this gets repetitive and slightly annoying
2) I know it's following the factual events, but I got so attached to Stephen and Jane's relationship that it left a sour taste in my mouth to see Jane flirt with / admit her feelings for Charlie Cox's character while she is still married to Stephen"
" Personal story of Stephen Hawking
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,7,The depiction of Stephen Hawking was very detailed and authentic in this film. It is a very personal film and covers many time periods of his life rather than particular events or achievements. The acting was great and the story was emotional.
" Wonderful Film
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,9,"The life of a young, brilliant student gets thrown apart when he finds out that he has about two years left, as a result of a terrible, regressive disease. Decided not to give up, with the help of his future wife, he starts working on his PhD, bringing into the world some theories never heard before. Although encountering many problems along the way, especially when talking about his health, he continues to amaze the world with his research, so many people come to bring him hope or even technical help, which will allow him to communicate and ultimately aid him in his pursuit of finding an unique and simple equation which will solve everything. It's a dramatic biography of one of the most brilliant minds the world has ever seen, filled with suspense, love, friendship, struggle but also relief and success. It manages to transmit a lot of emotion, the main actor having a flawless interpretation throughout the entire movie. His performance alone makes this movie a must see, let alone its plot and characters."
" The Theory of Everything
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,6,Great performances from the leads. The colour grading and focus were quite bizarre in a few scenes though.
" The Spectacular Story of a Spectacular Man
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,7,"The story of Stephen Hawking is truly remarkable. Overcoming such adversity to continue to be one of the finest scientific minds on earth is extraordinary. The main focus of the film is Stephen's relationship with his wife Jane, which is beautifully and tragically depicted. As much a story of humanity and life as it is science, The Theory of Everything is poignant and heart warming.My first thought after finishing this film was... God what a performance from Felicity Jones. Redmayne was great, a superb physical performance but the emotion and power from Jones was just something else. Spectacular. The love, admiration and care that she showed Redmayne in the film was marvellous. It was such a raw performance and really got to me. She was captivating throughout and really stole the show for me. As mentioned Redmayne was also superb, managing to bring so much to the performance.The story is very well presented, covering the beginning of Stephen and Jane's relationship, through to Stephen's illness and the subsequent adaption to their new lives. It's very well paced and covers a lot of their lives in the space of the film. Inspiring and impactful in equal measure, The Theory of Everything will stay with you for a while.One criticism of the film is the colouration. It seemed to be filmed with alternately a sepia or blueish tint, the reason for which I'm not quite sure. It certainly didn't add anything for me and was a bit off putting at times. Other than that the artistic choices were great, with solid direction and a magical soundtrack.Definitely a must watch film and worth watching for Felicity Jones's performance alone."
" What an act by Eddie Redmayne!!
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,8,"The theory of Everything is a biographical romantic drama movie directed by James Marsh and stars Eddie Redmayne, Felicity Jones, Charlie Cox, David Thewlis, Simon McBurney, Emily Watson and Maxine Peake.The movie is based on celebrated yet very difficult life of one of the greatest scientist in cosmology late Stephen Hawking.Late Stephen Hawking was undoubtedly one of the greatest scientist of his era with lots of physical difficulties which was with him lifelong and to portray his character was equally a difficult one but the way Eddie Redmayne has played this character is quite impressive. Felicity Jones was equally impressive in the role of Jane Wilde Late Hawking's first wife.Screenplay is good and has highlighted all the important aspects of the life of the scientist. Background music is equally impressive. The cinematography is another strong highlight of the movie and the Climax is perfect.One of the greatest biographical movie with strong acting."
" Really great film but I believe some people missunderstood the name of the title.
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,9,"I have watched this film with my mum and I think some people missunderstood this film. I believe it is to do with the title. There is a book called 'The Theory Of Everything' by Stephen Hawking but this film is about Stephen Hawking and so it says in the description.It's about how Stephen Hawking got his illness and how it was once said that he only had 2 years to live but he actually had more.I just think the person who made this film has to think about the title properly and I understand why a few people thought this film was going to be about science.
R.I.P Stephen Hawking"
" Eddie Redmayne is extraordinary.
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,8,"It's not often, but every now and then a part in a film is perfectly cast. Marlon Brando as Don Corleone, Heath Ledger as the Joker and Joe Pesci as Tommy DeVito in Goodfellas come to mind. Although I don't think this film is of the same calibre as The Godfather, The Dark Knight or Goodfellas, Redmayne's casting and performance is certainly on par with these great casting choices. The film itself is devastating, offering the viewer an insight into the world of a genius hindered by a horrific physical disease. More so than his intelligence, Hawking is shown to be something so much more important: inspiring."
" An ordinary biopic of an extraordinary life
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,7,"The story of Stephen Hawking, a man who overcome extraordinary physical disadvantages to become both a preeminent scientist and a best-selling author of popular science books is remarkable; but it's a difficult one to capture in a dramatic film. In that sense, 'The Theory of Everything' merely recounts what you might already have known about Hawking and has the same inherent weaknesses as most biopics. A strength is the very convincing portrait of Hawking's deteriorating physical condition; I wouldn't exactly call it a tour-de-force of acting per se (given Hawking's decreasing ability to directly convey his own emotional state), but the overall depiction is very good. Perhaps because his professional work was so complex, the film concentrates mostly on his emotional life, and that of his wife, Jane. Her story is told as one of quietly plucky Englishness; in places, one feels the film might have shied away from truly telling things how they were. Overall, it's nicely done, but unlikely to be revelatory for anyone already familiar with the material."
" Buon film
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,7,"Un buon film, mi è piaciuto abbastanza. Mi ha appassionato e mi è piaciuto.
Il mio personalissimo voto è 7/10."
" Boring.
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,2,"I expected this to be his life story with tons of scientifical research and stuff, a lot of physics and math explained, more about his theories, but it's just his personal life story. You know just because it's a famous person does not mean his personal life is very interesting."
" For Hawking, everything has its theory, but love does not.
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"The focus of the film is not Hawking's scientific achievements, but his life and emotions. The actors perform well, especially the stubborn and painful entanglement in the eyes of the Jane. There was a lot of soft light and warm light throughout the movie, and the covered filter diluted the pain of the disease he endured. As an ordinary person, I can't help but think, when he suffered such torture and hardship, did he really think of giving up? Fortunately, he is not an ordinary person, but a person who wants to explain everything with a simple and beautiful equation. The cosmic stars at the end are magnificent, how can the person who holds the universe in his mind be an ordinary person?"
" The Theory of Everything
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,8,"The actors were very successful. Eddie and felicity both gave the best performance of their careers. The stubborn eyes of the latter were especially infectious. Focusing on the love and personal life of great scientists, soft light, cold / warm light, virtual focus, high-speed and Super 8 lens are widely used to create romantic temperament. It's smart to do the right thing. Hawking is an unfortunate but lucky man. Bless those strong and selfless women."
" I would have given it a ten star rating but...
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,9,I thoroughly should have enjoyed the whole movie and given it a ten star rating but it got annoying when the camera started to shake around all over the place... Absolutely no need to spoil a movie by shaking the damn camera in my opinion...
" An amazing movie- Outclass acting - Worth watching
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,10,"The movie is based on the biopic of the great physicist Stephen Hawking.
From the beginning of the movie the story revolves around Stephen's life and one unfortunate day getting injured an diagnosed with the disease. His romance
with his wife, his struggles to work; while watching I could feel the emotion depicted in the movie. The movie provides inspiration to work without thinking about the consequences.
Now talking about the acting of Eddie and Felicity it is just breathtaking
their acting makes the movie worth watching. I really appreciate the care the filmmakers had taken in making the film as perfect as possible.
I really felt that I had been there by myself looking everything in front of my eye. I thoroughly enjoyed the film."
" Amazing movie
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,9,"Eddie Redmayne was so so good. His acting alone makes this movie worth watching. The movie does justice to portray Stephen Hawking's life. We know the story, but it is made wonderfully."
" ""Prove with an elegant equation that time has a starting point""-the movie ""The Theory of Everything""
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,7,"The film tells Hawking's experience from his youth to the publication of ""A Brief History of Time"" in the form of a biography. His relationship with his wife serves as the main line of the story, satisfying people's curiosity and prying eyes, and also revealing a beautiful but regretful love.""I have loved you.I did my best.""The story starts in Cambridge in 1963. Hawking and partner Brian are racing bicycles on the street. The two came to a secret tavern at the end of the cycling race and pushed open the wooden door, which was filled with young people who were listening to songs. Here, Hawking met his later wife Jane for the first time.The two exchanged physics on the stairs.-""What does the cosmologist believe in""-""What do you believe in?"" Uses a unified equation to explain everything in the universe.-""is it""-""Yes""-""What equation""""The problem is here"" This question is very good, I don't know yet, but I want to study it ""They exchange contact information, meet in the game hall, and participate in dance parties as each other's partners. They enjoy every day like ordinary lovers. In the conversation, the difference in belief between the two was also reflected. Hawking is an atheist. Religion believes in miracles, but miracles and science often cannot coexist. And Jane is a devout believer, and God is one of her spiritual pillars. Such a contradiction of faith has also become one of the fuse of their end of marriage.At Cambridge University, Hawking was recognized and admired by his mentors and classmates with his extraordinary ability.Unfortunately, after a coma, Hawking was diagnosed with a rare amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and was told by the doctor that there were only two years of life left. However, Jane did not leave him. .In a conversation with Hawking's father, Jane faced Hawking's father's rational advice and said, ""I don't think I'm very strong, but I love him and we must fight together.""The couple's married life is beautiful but full of challenges. As the three children grew older, Jane's life pressure also increased, she had to take care of the whole family alone, while studying for a doctorate.In the choir of St. Mark's Church, she meets Jonathan Jones, a kind and passionate man. Gradually, Jones and Hawking's family moved closer and closer, and in close contact, Jane and Jones developed a romantic friendship. Hawking was keenly aware, but reluctantly accepted the reality because he felt that his wife and the family needed help. And Jane and Jones strive to maintain friendship in order not to let broken families continue to be broken.After the pneumonia was cured, Hawking lost his ability to speak, and the heavy pressure of life forced Jane to come to the nanny Elaine. The arrival of Elaine became a special part of Hawking 's monotonous life. He showed humor in front of Elaine and never before Jane after getting sick. They wrote books together and read the magazine ""Loft"" together. Elaine helped him Cook everything. Hawking showed a childlike smile in front of her.This became the fuse of Hawking and Jane's marriage.""I have loved you. I did my best."" I have loved you and I did my best.At the end of the film, Hawking danced with Jane in a wheelchair. Jane was invited as an honorary partner of Hawking to accept the Queen's reception.""Your glasses are always so dirty""At the May Ball many years ago, Hawking and Jane, who did not dance, discussed physics, poetry, and religion.""Do you want to be religious""""I don't believe in this kind of god who controls everything""""Why study medieval Spanish poetry?""""Probably because ... I like to travel through time and space""""At the beginning of creation, there was only heaven and earth;Chaos of the earth, no stereotypesDarkness hangs over the abyss ""I will always remember that you do n't love dancing but dancing with me. You have clear eyes under your dirty glasses. I loved you, I tried my best.We have all seen each other love each other, and we have seen each other love each other. We all tried our best.Hawking 's academic research is relatively small in the entire film. His legendary life proved the singularity theorem and the black hole area theorem of general relativity. He proposed the black hole evaporation theory and the unbounded Hawking universe model. Two basic theories-Einstein 's theory of relativity and Planck 's quantum mechanics-an important step forward. Sitting in a wheelchair, tapping the typewriter with three fingers, writing fifteen books.""We humans are nothing but advanced primates, living on a small planet, orbiting an ordinary star, there are hundreds of millions of x galaxies outside the galaxy we live in. However, since the birth of human civilization Since then, people have never stopped exploring the fundamental laws of the world. What is the boundary of the universe, there must be a special answer. But is there a more specific answer than no boundary? Similarly, there is no boundary for human potential We are all different, no matter how hard life is, you will always have your own way to shine. Life is endless, and hope is not limited. ""Hawking's life is looking for a beautiful equation to prove time and prove that the universe has no boundaries."
" I still say Benny C was robbed!
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,"I still say Benedict Cumberbatch should have won the Oscar for Best Actor, but Eddie Redmayne did a good job. He makes you believe that he is Stephen Hawking. This movie is very emotional, heartfelt, and beautiful. If I had seen this prior to making my Best of 2014 list, it would have been on there. I really enjoyed the score, and everyone acting did a great job. I really enjoyed the 2 ""Doctor Who"" references, and the theory that was used in the movie ""Interstellar."" It was amazing seeing how Stephen Hawking was suddenly diagnosed with this disease, and was expected to live for only 2 years as of the day of diagnosis, but defied those expectations and is still alive today. I really appreciate the care that the filmmakers took in making the film as accurate as possible. The real Stephen Hawking even said that at certain points of the film he thought he was watching himself. While I do disagree with the Academy, I still thoroughly enjoyed this film and am happy that it at least won some awards, even if I don't agree with the Best Actor win.
Grade: A+ 10/10 5/5 stars"
" Nice but not great.
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,7,"Very well crafted for Oscars. It's not unentertaining to watch, but it also gives you nothing other than ""Geez, that guy can do a really good imitation of Hawking""."
" An absolute tribute to the legend Stephen Hawking
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,9,"We all know who Stephen Hawking is but do we all know him actually? This is it. This film pays a wonderful tribute to the physician who struggled in life like nobody could ever imagine and yet he has proven that time is enough for everybody to succeed. This craft of direction is supremely appreciated. Direction wise, it gives us what we exactly need. Emotions, pride, happiness, anxiety. Music is one of the aspect where it hasn't been too exaggerated but, served what the screenplay needs . Technicalities are never an issue for this kind of film because the story is the stakeholder here.Eddie Redmayne hence proved why is he my favorite actor and now he has established himself as my favorite actor of all time. Every frame, he has this immense amount of acting which exactly resembles the emotion or feeling Stephen going through at that time. A brilliant actor indeed. The part where he sees his son playing guitar in the guidance of Jonathan breaks my heart. The moments where he wants to cry but he couldn't, his love and sacrifice for his wife, every pinch of acting is appreciated which is why he gained his first Oscar after all.This film gave me the strength to live life in the happiest way as possible. No matter who you are and how your disability pulls you down, you can still find a path of hope through love and this is exactly the proof of it. Thanks to the entire cast of this film coming by and gathered to produce such a fantastic art which will live for years ."
" Overlong And Boring At Times, But Well-Done Overall
",2020-03-09 00:00:00,7,"""The Theory of Everything"" tells us the true story of Steven Hawkings. Although I am somewhat familiar with some of the basic details of the man's life and his career as a scientist, I must admit that I do not know all there is to know about his personal life. Never having read any biographies I cannot tell you how much of this is fact and how much is ""creative license,"" so to speak.It would seem that they stuck to the basic facts, however, as the story is indeed boring at times. If they wanted to make parts up they could have come up with something much more interesting I am sure. But it is still a good movie nonetheless and gives us a look at the life of one great man."
" Mostly boring biopic with vague intentions
",2020-03-06 00:00:00,4,"Mostly boring biopic with vague intentions. Eddie Redmayne goes full I Am Sam and I can't decide if it's better or worse that this character is based on a real person. In short: melodrama of the highest order, but a totally adequate telling of the background story of a notable life you likely aren't familiar with. The curiosity in me can't deny that even if I never care to watch it again."

" Heartwrenchinly inspiring...
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,10,Redmayne's performance was astounding. The portrayal was heartwrenching yet inspiring.
" Really touching
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,8,"The scenario is perfectly well-written in this movie, the performances by Felicity Jones and Eddie Redmayne are wonderful so this movie makes a really good Biopic about Stephen Hawking, it tells a pertinent and needed story, it takes even more sense now after his death. I'm a little bit deceive however, that this movie is not very original, it is made with a formula that will already known, however this formula is well applied. To conclude, I think that this movie is worth a watch, but it won't become a classic."
" Brilliance, but at what cost?
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,8,"Once again, we have a biopic about a famous person who did a lot of great things in their field, but the star of the show is the woman who supported him from the background. I found Jane Hawking to be a much more impressive person, considering all she had to deal with. Even in the midst of everything, she didn't lose her faith, she didn't give in to other desires, she didn't give up hope. Steven, on the other hand (impressively portrayed by Eddie Redmayne), doesn't change. Sure, his physical state deteriorates, but his character never really developed or grew. In an Oscar season bloated with biopics, this one was easy to get lost in the blur."
" A better version of ""A Beautiful Mind""
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,7,"The focus is more Hawking the person, than Hawking the genious, and giving the complexity of his work, I think that was a smart choice. And it's not completely forgotten. They ""dumb down"" the science and try to include it enough to show how smart this guy is, but not to go over the head of the ""not that smart"".A violent score almost force emotion on us. And it kind of works. The movie had me ""almost crying"" every 20 minutes or so. A little ""too Disney"" at moments, but typical of Hollywood bios. This time, it was effective with me. The acting from Redmayne (Hawking) and Jones (Jane Hawking) were awesome, helped by a bunch of moments to show off (some subtle, some melodramatic).In the end, cliched, with too much melodrama but all well done, the smart decision of not go too much into the absurdly complicated science, good acting and a coherent story of ""overcoming the adversities"".PD: The use of God and Hawking's perspective about it through the film, I think is particularly smart (even I don't like how present God is in the story about a scientist) and I gave an extra point for it."

" The Theory of Everything: LOVE
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,9,"This film is about a highly intelligent and physically ill man who is who he is because of how his love changed his life. This movie is written as emotional vignettes and it really works. Unlike other movies like this which are more focused on what scientists do, this movie is about Hawking's personal life and how it affected him to become the person he was. Eddie Redmayne deserved his Oscar, he was magnificent and Felicity was also amazing. There are few differences with this movie and the real life as always and I think they changed these truths in order to make the message clearer. This movie is a really great love story and I recommend you to see it. RIP Stephen Hawking"
" Brilliant performances
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,7,The absolutely brilliant performances by Redmayne and Jones save this romantic drama based on the memoir by Jane Hawking from being mediocre - I definitely enjoyed it more than I thought I would.
" Excellent acting,
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,5,"The main actors couldn't have made it better.The different storylines are not well integrated. The introductions of new storylines/topics feel to sharp at times.It's a good movie worth watching, but, while it is the biography of a scientist, it is not a movie about the history of science."
" Romantic Aspect was Good
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,3,"I liked the romance in this. The rest was stupid. I wasn't too much of a fan. I think you should skip it, or watch it. It wasn't too bad. It was decent.3 stars"
" A real charmer
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,8,"A real charmer of a film. Eddie Redmayne plays the role of Stephen Hawking superbly, as 'The Theory of Everything' portrays Hawking's exceptional life. Jóhann Jóhannsson's score is very good, it really gets you attached to each scene."
" Time stood while watching this movie
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,10,"I have always wanted to see this movie.
So I got to see this movie on Netflix and could not believe how great the acting was all round.How amazing that Jane stayed and helped Stephen, even though he could have been dead in 2 years.Stephen was funny and humble and realised his mistakes, always trying to improve himself, even though his body was letting him down.Thank goodness the doctors were wrong, and that he survived to become a professor, and to write the most valuable books and theories of all time."
" Thank You for this movie
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,9,"Yes, Thank you for this movie. Stephen Hawking deserve his biography. In this movie, Eddie Redmayne performance is the best ever after Denish Girl. Felicity Jones- What an actress she is.
One of the best movie to watch."
" Favorite
",2019-11-30 00:00:00,10,My favorite film so far. Don't be late to watch it!
" This is your film if you said ""Stephen Who?""
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,3,"I had such high hopes for this film, yet somehow managed a few years without watching it. Definitely not worth the buildup.I wanted to see more about his mind, his theories... how he worked, where he struggled, whom he interacted with, etc... Yes, I'm a physicist and I realize that a lot of it would have to be simplified for lay people, but to resort to Hollywood tropes of genius, fancy impressive equations on a chalkboard. It was like nails on a ... well, you know. The content of his life and work took a backstage to such a ridiculously diluted version of the relationships that it made me wonder why in the galaxy did they bother.Don't come for the bulk of the screen time (about Jane Hawking) or you'll be disappointed, too. The film reduced her massive care-taking role to one scene of exhaustion. The rest of the relationship - and others - are diluted to the point of misrepresentation if not near-fiction. Every emotional conflict follows the script of ""now weep with love in your eyes."" There's no dimension, no nuance, just caricatured human tolerance.I gave it 3 stars instead of fewer because Theory was a watchable movie while I did cardio in the gym. (Don't let that fool you into thinking I did 2 hours of cardio; it was easy to walk away from and start again the next day.) The acting itself wasn't painful and if I could pretend it was a fiction it was decent. I think I also clung onto hope it could get better. Sadly, the juice never came out of the squeeze.This is Hollywood loving itself, using famous people to do it... good looking famous people, of course..."
" Hard movie to make about Hawking
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,7,"I haven't followed Hawking's career and I only knew that he studied black holes and universe. Unfortunately this movie only told me that he had a wife and 3 kids.For dramatic value it works. The self sacrifice of the wife, beating the odds and living long life despite early prognosis of 2 years. In addition to that he wrote couple books and changed the world of physics.
Movie completely focuses on the daily struggles, the progression of his ALS and what impact did it have on him, on his family and friends.I don't know why I expected more. I probably saw too many fiction movies lately that it is hard for me to appreciate the biography of a man who never gave up."
" Not bad!
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,5,"But not great! Very very predictable, in the slow and boring style of many British films of recent years. Eddie Redmayne really does play a big part as the
unfortunate character of Stephen Hawking. Felicity Jones is just OK in the role of his loving wife who, after all, though she promised to never leave him, leaves him to be with another man. A very pleasant presence, the extremely natural David Thewlis, as a fellow teacher. One last thing: Daniel Day-Lewis is a million times better than Redmayne in ""My Left Foot"" (1989), a similar role."
" Outstanding
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,9,Eddie Redmayne does a tremendous job with a difficult role. Definitely Oscar-worthy.
" Irony had me cracking up
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,5,"While he is working so hard to prove that everything is evolving, he is actually deteriorating. I only give 5 stars because not much else was funny"
" Should have played up the drama more
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,2,"First off, Stephen and Jane are both acted excellently. Stephen Hawking himself put it best when he said at times he felt like he was watching himself, and Jane perfectly portrays the difficult of raising a family with such a disabled husband.However, this movie sticks too strictly to the facts, which makes this movie feel more like a written biography rather than a big budget drama. This could be forgiven if it also showed all of Stephen's highlights, but it significantly downplays his achievements by failing to convince the audience that his ideas were truly revolutionary. Understandably, the film only touches on the actual subjects that he studied, but it also fails to convey how controversial and award worthy his discoveries were. The result is a low-drama Hollywood drama that underplays the most important parts of the biography."
" My Review!
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,9,"You know life is good when there are such beautiful movies. I've always assumed Stephen Hawking as a man who is really really serious in nature and goodness I was wrong. All those who're interested in knowing a bit about who he is, I reckon this movie would be the best way to describe him. Well played Eddie Redmayne. You won an Oscar, anything less, is injustice. Well directed, James Marsh.Peace Out!"
" A somber, yet powerfully optimistic biopic
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,9,"James Marsh directs The Theory of Everything, which tells the life of theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and his longtime partner Jane Hawking.Eddie Redmayne 'becomes' Stephen hawking in an Oscar winning performance, where he perfectly captures the intelligence, charm and unfortunate torment that his real life counterpart carries with him. Redmayne truly embodies someone who suffers from motor neurone disease and the effects it has on a person. Through his mannerisms, posture and speech, he delivers a captivating performance.I respect that the film doesn't focalise Stephen Hawking completely, and takes the time to focus on those around him, and the struggles they endure through Stephen's fall to disability. Jane Hawking played by Felicity Jones is great in this film, and being someone closely tied to a mother of children with disabilities, I highly resonated with the struggle of responsibility in looking after loved ones who need care, and needing help yourself.I'm glad to see that the story doesn't heavily rely on sympathy for Stephen Hawking to make the audience care for him. Though the film is definitely somber, it displays a surprising amount of optimism and humour, of course due to the personal attributes of Stephen Hawking himself, and the great success he found in his downfall.Visually the film is nothing spectacular, and actually features an unfocused dream-like effect at times that doesn't quite hit the mark for me. On the contrary there are some very well shot scenes that emphasise the drama occurring on screen, rendering events that much more impactful.This biopic on Stephen Hawking is one I feel is hard to watch, though very important in context of what we know about cosmology today and everything he devoted to the knowledge of our kind. Great respect is paid to the professor through heartfelt writing and superb performances with great chemistry between Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. A must see for everyone."
" Was really the movie about Hawking?
",2019-08-20 00:00:00,7,"Don't get me wrong, it's a good dramatic movie with great performances, but in the end i couldn't stop asking myself why in the middle of all that melancholia, the character that has more development is actually his wife?
She ends up having most moral dilemmas, character development and actual screentime than Stephen. It was like the movie was trying to send the message that if it weren't for her, Hawking wouldn't made it.
In fact, behind a great man there's always a great woman and vice versa, but since we were seeing a biopic about Hawking, kind of would made more sense for the argument and the camera to spend more time with him and less with his wife, particularly spending so much time around the obvious infidelity, of which we are deprived to see acomplished probably out of virtue signaling from the director.
From a ""i love you no matter what"" we come to the conclusion of ""i have loved you"", once again giving Jane almost a moral power over Hawking. Something like ""you couldn't done it if it weren't for me, so i'm free from all my sins"". It's a subversive dialogue of a woman having power over a crippled man. And it all happens when Hawking admits God exists, giving Jane a triumphant final moment. Hawking seems to come to the conclusion, that she stayed more out of stubborn faith than for love.
All these dilemmas together with stellar performances, made this movie a very gratifying watch, even if i don't agree with paths taken."
" Eddie Redmayne is A Beast
",2019-08-02 00:00:00,7,The Movie was Good but Eddie Redmayne gave us a once in a lifetime Performance
" A great performance in an interesting biopic - but maybe a little too respectful.
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,6,"Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar for his performance as the cruelly disabled Stephen Hawking in this film, and you can see why. He has mastered amazingly the contortions and ticks that advancing Motor Neurone Disease inflicted upon the increasingly famous cosmologist. But his depiction of Hawking's earlier days at Cambridge is also impressive, helped by careful attention to detail and also by a fairly strong physical resemblance.Sadly, though, this performance alone cannot make for a great film. The story here is not really about Hawking's scientific breakthroughs, nor about his perhaps less appreciated role in popularising science with his hugely successful books; but mainly it centres in his first marriage to Jane Wilde, played by Felicity Jones. Hers is also a bravura performance, but, as many people have noted, she does not appear to age over the decades' span of the story.The real problem though is a nagging feeling that something is missing. Many people will know already the key facts of this story, and the film, in reality, does not reveal much more. It's not just the lightness of the science, nor the way in which his earlier public appearances do not appear to figure in the story, but even the main theme of the marriage feels incomplete. Perhaps it's because the screenplay is based largely on Jane Wilde Hawking's own book, and all the major players were alive when the film was produced.Inevitable pressures in the relationship are hinted at, but what we see still seems rather sugar-coated. When Jane is challenged as to the fatherhood of their third child, we realise we've seen little of the intimacy of their marriage, but also we barely seem to have scratched the surface of Jane's other ambiguous relationship with choirmaster Jonathan Jones (played by Charlie Cox).It's a shame, because no one's about to revisit this story since there's little chance they will be able to match Redmayne's central interpretation.Still. The film is worth watching for its strong performances. 6/10."
" Very good movie
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,8,The Theory of Everything is an Oscar winning movie starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. It is based off a true story of the late Stephen Hawkings who died in March 2018 with Lor Gor Disease similar to motor neuron disease.The film explores from when Stephen was a brilliant physist to a man struggling with his condition where his wheelchair bounded and uses a computer to help him communicate. We also see his two wives Jane and Elaine along with his children.Eddie Redmaye was brilliant as Stephen Hawkings you swear it was really him right down to the movements in the wheelchair.If you haven't seen this film I suggest you to watch it on Netflix. It was worth seeing.
" I'M READY FOR A STANDING OVATION AT THE OSCARS FOR EDDIE AND JONES.
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,7,"Do you really know what is asked of you when you vow to love someone in sickness and in health? What happens when disability doesn't allow you to love the way you want? Are you better off just breaking free if you have the chance?
Obviously going through the physical transformation must be rewarded. Contorting his body and learning the physical tics that Stephen Hawking has displayed in real life all ring true. Since his breakout work in Les Miserables, a role that should have landed him a nomination for Best Supporting Actor, I was wary to believe I'd revisit a praising session with the young actor so soon. It's one of the best things offered this year.
The Theory of Everything is not about the equations or the mathematics. It's essentially about us. It's about love, and not just in the form of marriage. We as humans learn to love ourselves, our families, and our children. They are placed in our lives but I'm not sure how much we realize what goes into maintaining those relationships. The movie makes you think of those things."

" Beautiful and Inspiring
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,9,"A beautiful story has been told through the eye of the camera, the adapted novel taught me more of the fascinating life of Steven Hawking. I found it incredible to live through the believable telling of Hawkings emotional existence in the theory of everything. The equilibrium was just wonderful and I found the whole movie powerful. The reflection of Hawkings character, the source of humour and unique brilliance was excellent. The connection and understanding of a rare relationship was delivered with the highest quality. Its also important to note Eddie Redmaynes contribution to this movie, acting with complete soul and dedication. Marvellous to watch and whilst it felt like prying into this personal yet superb story, I felt inspired."
" Sad but great movie
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,8,"The actor of the man who portrays Hawking in this film did an absolutely incredible job of mimicking Hawking and showing how horrible ALS is to suffer from.
The movie did a great job at evoking emotion from the viewer, and it was a sad film to see. However, it really does do a great job at showing off Hawking's life and his achievements, along with the marriage he had with his wife."
" Majestic lighting
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,8,"This is not only a good movie, but a wonderful story. The story is full of ups and downs throughout Hawking's life and gives an amazing (fairytale like) insight into his younger years. Eddie Redmayne does a wonderful portrayal of Stephen Hawking which never feels off. The relationships built are abundant and impactful. The actors make every relationship feel real and intimate. The deterioration of Hawking was done very well and gradually (I would hope that was how it really was). The best part is definitely the cinematography and especially the lighting. The lighting creates this amazing mood and atmosphere that the characters flow throw. Overall extremely heartwarming."
" A Declining Drama
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,7,"The Theory of Everything definitely sets the movie up with tremendous hope but the obvious reality of the true life story sends the characters hurtling in despair and grief.

Isn't it overwhelming, in a good way, that consciousness was born from giving instead of consuming? I don't think this is a false conclusion.The theory of everything has caught the essence of what they have intended to show and it is enough to call into action those who needed and wanted to understand the greater need of a person to contribute rather than be a passive part of a reaction. I don't think I realize yet what lies ahead. There is a need to be careful. There may be weights against us but those are weights that we may overcome. Heavy defeats? Defeats are a very human concept. There is only implosions and explosions. Matter can neither be created nor destroyed. You cannot limit to human attributes the magnitude of ideas spread here. Because in the first place, with our limitations, we cannot even fathom by the use of our limited senses and abilities, the implications of the concepts shaping this artwork. The lines, ""It's okay Robbie"" and ""The beginning of time."" offers the duality of perspective and equal weights and pull of its influence in directing his quality of life.Some particles can escape a black hole? Let's be those particles. Let's radiate. HAHAHA. This is funny because that means we'll be part of an explosion.In case I become dumb in the future, I would like to remind myself that before exploding, we must consume what we need to make that explosive reaction how we want to be be. Gather the right elements. Find your equation. Have no doubts on your strengths. Just spend time filling the room for improvement."
" What Happens to the Brain?
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,9,"The Theory of Everything is an absolutely wonderful film. The on-screen chemistry from Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones is hypnotizing. The score for this film is great as well. Discussing space and time can often lead you deep into your thoughts and wonder and the music plays into it very well. I understand that there are many inaccuracies and many scientists are turned off by it. However, viewing this as anstand alone movieni give it a 9/10. Eddie Redmayne did an outstanding job and absolutely deserved the Oscar!"
" Motivational
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,8,The movie made me realize that I should be grateful for my health.
" A Very Touching and Clever Movie
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,10,"This is a great movie to appreciate the wonderful works of our beloved Stephen Hawking. This movie is beautiful. It makes me and my mother cry in our hearts. It is a very touching movie, explaining not only Mr. Hawking's success, but also explaining his sacrifices for his wife, Jane Hawking, and letting her go meet her one true love and pursue her dreams. He loved her so much, and for that reason, he was willing to let her go for her own reasons and for her health. This movie shows that even though Mr. Hawkings was a disabled man, he conquered his disabilities and let his happiness kill all those negative thoughts. He's a wonderful man, and I can't wait to see the reviews of other people who watch this touching, and so true and raw movie."
" Oscar-baity film-making at its finest!
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,7,"""The Theory of Everything"" has everything to please the Academy, and not just in theory. Indeed, if someone tells me that James Marsh directed this movie without dreaming of the Oscars, I'll pull a Michael Corleone and say: ""now who's being naïve?""This film is a school-case; it features all the boxes to tick for the Oscars: a contemporary biopic? Check. British celebrity? Double check. A world-wide known character? Check. Intelligent? Check. Disabled? Triple-check. A dysfunctional family drama spanning three decades? A climactic discovery? An inspirational speech? The story of Stephen Hawking was begging for a movie adaptation because this is the kind of performances that will never go unnoticed, and I bet Eddie Redmayne could already choose the spot in his cupboard for the Oscar the day he signed the script.And like Sean Penn who took away Mickey Rourke's only possible shot at the Oscars, Eddie Redmayne took it from Michael Keaton. Remember when ""Birdman"" came out, it was all about Keaton until ""The Theory of Everything"" raised its little head and every Academy pundit knew it was over for Batman, 'Robin' would steal his thunder. Serves him for not playing a tragic inspirational real-life figure, that's the lesson we learned from Rourke's loss. Just look at all the winners in the past 10 years: Winston Churchill, Hugh Glass, Abraham Lincoln, George VI, Amin Dada, Truman Capote, fictional characters never really pay off.And you can't even blame the Academy, Eddie Redmayne is actually the best thing about the film, his performance really makes you believe this is Stephen Hawking resurrecting as a young freshman and then slowly descending into the condition that made him such a pop culture icon celebrated in ""The Simpsons"" and ""The Big Bang Theory"". And the film showed a fascinating aspect about Stephen: for someone who didn't believe in God, he exemplified the idea that God gives when he takes away and Lou Gehrig's disease was so great a handicap He could only compensate it by making Hawking the greatest mind of the twentieth century, second to Einstein.But I digress because the film, while celebrating Hawking' achievement, also focuses on his family life with Jane. Felicity Jones is good as the all-loving but then long-suffering wife, highlighting a sort of bipolar temptation from the film. It tries to be two things at the same time: ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""My Left Foot"", it's far better than the former which relied on misleading thrills to make Nash' life more interesting, but maybe I wished it dared a little more and could plunge us in the mind of the genius, or focus on the internal battle between his inner self (he wasn't an isolated nerd but a lazy, easygoing fellow), his struggle to understand the universe and make himself understood.That mental exploration was the kind of stunts I expect from movies about intelligent or visionary people, to make you feel more intelligent, but the treatment is rather superficial because the story is busy swinging back and forth between drama and science, to insist on the woman behind the great man. So it all comes to a simple question: are we interested? If so, to what extent? It's always nice to have the external insight but this is why I was so critical at the film's conventional aspect (it's an Oscar baity film if I ever saw one), it should have kept Jones as a supporting character and be more focused on Hawking's world, Jones was a comforting and important presence but she wasn't pivotal in his achievements.So just when we have a glimpse on his genius and the film seems to take off to some realms of intellectual celebrations, we have the domestic life back again, problem with the kids, with the family, the gossips, the gas bills... this is a man who's contemplating the universe, the big bang, time and we have to endure the peripheral aspects, it's like someone pointing out to the moon and we have to endure the finger. I didn't hate that approach, overall, the treatment was well done but it fell flat. If Marsh anted to highlight that aspect, maybe he needed an extra hour because I didn't care much for Felicity Jones.Or maybe I should retract that bit, the first parts did annoy me in the sense that the love story looked like a retread of ""A Beautiful Mind"", it became interesting when he lot the ability to speak and the marriage went downhill. However; we never feel the real transition between happy and sad Jane. So to end on a comparison, the film manages to be a sort 2010s ""Pride of the Yankees"": the man's popular then there's the illness, relatives coping with them and the final speech, of course, this time, he survives but the couple falls apart. It's all done well when it comes to biopic about such tormented characters, you expect more.It's like Redmayne was trapped in that wheelchair and could only stick to Hawking's mimics in order to guarantee his Oscar, it was his zone of comfort, Jones was the actress who went beyond the limit of a two-dimensional role and gave it a poignant aura and the film could take its way to the Oscars, it played it safe and succeeded admirably by grabbing the Best Actor Oscar.
At least, ""Birdman"" tried something new and got the Best Picture. But the film seems to equate the award with a series of parameters cohabiting with harmony, I guess I can say it's a great Oscar-bait movie, it's a very limited way to look at it, but still better than being a bad Oscar one. And I just realized James Marsh had won the Oscar with ""Man On Wire"", so he's capable of making inspirational movies with a uniqueness of their own."
" Wonderful acting in a timid approach to one of the most brilliant and complex men in history
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,7,"This movie should have been a 10 with the wonderful acting from Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones. The underused supporting cast was wonderful where they were used and the music was haunting and beautifully integrated to the emotional highpoints of the movie. James Marsh does a wonderful job of building the intense personal moments of the movie, the one thing I felt was missing was the understated enormity of those moments. Perhaps that was his intent, however; it left me a little empty. Like the movie, just a little more fluid and depth and I would have loved it!"
" Interesting perspective on a genius' life
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,7,"For starters it should be said that the movie is by far much more about Hawking's personal life than about his academic career and contribution. However, one will get some minor insights in what he was doing (I'm not an expert myself, you might judge differently in case you are).In my perspective the movie shows in a vivid manner how ALS affected Hawking's life and makes one think about how such dramatic disease would affect everyone's life. This also made me think about how much more difficult it must have been for Hawking to write books in comparison to a healthy person (the actual act of writing). So I really liked the movie for making me think about those kind of things.In my opinion, the actors did quite a good job, especially Redmayne managed to play Hawking convincingly and also to convey Hawking's feelings in a probable mannerMy major point of critique is that the movie is quite slow and during some scenes my attention slipped away as the movie was a bit boring to me at times."
" Exceptional
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,10,"More an exploration of Stephen Hawking's heart than his head and of the complexities of love in place of quantum physics, this emotionally charged piece is as upliftingly optimistic as it is heart-wrenchingly tragic. Redmayne utterly encapsulates the great physicist in this career defining performance, captivating in its sheer force of will and inspirational in its compassion; this is the story not of a man's battle to be brilliant in the face of adversity, but simply to live and love like any other."
" Professional and Approachable
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)This chronicles the life of Stephen Hawking from his University days through his book A Brief History of Time. It starts off with his touching courtship of his wife and his early flashes of scientific brilliance, the tough times as his body is ravaged by ALS, he and his wife's adjustment into his wheelchair and finally to the prototype for his talking device as they was an early technological experiment. Overall this was a basic professional and well-done Hollywood movie. Very orderly, clear and approachable. Shot with crisp and warm period colors and rustic English settings. The topic of Science v God is a running theme through Hawking's life and with his wife who has a strong faith. Overall, it was a good overview to his life."
" Acting masterclass
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,8,What a performance from eddy redmane. You learn so much about Hawkins life and how awful it much have been for him. A brilliant film
" The Theory of Everything is Everything You Wanted and More
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,9,"Hit with the diagnosis of motor neuron disease, 23 year old Stephen Hawking was given a mere two years to live. Having survived another 5 decades, his health had large part to do with his first love Jane Hawking (well, Wilde). Based of Wilde's 2007 memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life With Stephen, The Theory of Everything has an ability for you to feel defeated and triumphant at the same time.
The film follows Stephen (Eddie Redmayne) and Jane (Felicity Jones) from their first encounter in college through the 30 years of marriage that was a extraordinary struggle for both parties. Stephen struggling more and more with his impending demise, Jane puts her education and future career on hold. Having to do all the care for not only their three children but for the physicist as well, Jane had issues from the beginning. Stephen pursued his worked, publishing two books in the span of the marriage. He had a better understanding of the universe, then his one wife's needs. When she pleaded for assistance in care taking of the family, Stephen pushed harder saying it was unneeded. When they both hit a breaking point they find a choirmaster from the church, Jonathan Hellyer Jones (Charlie Cox), that assists Jane in her daily duties for both Stephen and the children. He also stirs up emotions that are just another issue to the collapsing marriage. When Stephen finally gets a full time nurse, is the union is irreparable.
The Theory of Everything does something unexpected, if you heard the movie was going to be about a world renowned physicist, you would expect any love story to be thrown out the window. This film is different, you believe in the love between Stephen and Jane. Eddie Redmayne, most known for his part in Les Misérables, trades in his immense singing voice for a role with growing limitations. It may not have not been set in the ever dangerous French Revolution, but the role of the disease stricken physicist was extremely trying and it is showcased. Redmayne did remarkable work making you believe that he himself was struggling with ALS, but never stopped bringing the same joy and triumph from the beginning to the end, no matter how many words were spoken. Being extremely physically demanding, Eddie Redmayne did a incredible helping see the other side the renowned scientist; a loving husband and caring father.
Although the Theory of Everything is a modern film or artistry, it does have its downfalls. Throughout the film you see Jane struggle with everything she has done for the relationship, but you don't really see what Stephen did to help speed the impending demise. You start to hatred toward the lovely Jane because she just wants to live the life she wanted. She is loathed by the audience for merely trying to receive a life she deserves. Playing Stephen off as divine and not at all the cause of the forthcoming split. It takes two people and Jane and all she did for him was being taken for granted. In the end, you learn to appreciate the time they had together as if you were apart of their lives. You feel as if you are both happy and sad with how the way things turn out.
The script causes you to cherish the ability we have to communicate. As time goes on, Stephen slowly loses his ability to speak and express emotions, but the one person who was always there to interpret his words, thoughts, and feelings was Jane. As he lost the ability to function as a normal person and deprived of living his former life, Felicity Jones is magnificent in how she picks up the pieces and keeps up an outstanding performance.
The direction of the film is truly its holy grail. James Marsh, famous for is academy award winning documentary, Man on a Wire, truly knows how to make true stories feel as if you are in them. The use of close up and point of view puts you in the movie. When Stephen is receiving the devastating news, you see it from his point of view, looking at the doctor telling him he has limited time you see how everything else starts to become a large blur. You step out of the theater into the film and it leaves a lasting effect like no other. Marsh handles the instrumental task of not only somebody's work but they love and care it took to create it. All the devastations and all victories, you are placed in the world with them.
The Theory of Everything is extremely moving. You are placed into the movie and for two hours you live in a different time. It's heartbreaking and inspiring in how love conquers diagnosis and how a diagnoses can become the downfall to a relationship. Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones put on two marvelous performances that will not be forgotten."
" Rent, don't buy
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"This is an excellent movie I never have to see again.This film is based on a book written by Jane Hawking and it focuses on Stephen Hawking as a man rather than Stephen Hawking as a scientist. The people involved in this film did an incredible job, and you can tell Eddie Redmayne put a lot of work into the physical aspects of his role. But like many award winning films I watch, I find I never have a desire to give it a second viewing. There wasn't a scene I wanted to revisit or something I thought I would understand better if I watched it again. It's a well crafted film, and I think I got all I could from watching it once. So I would recommend watching it, but I would opt to stream it or rent it somewhere."
" absolutely beautiful in execution
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,8,"Many dismiss this film as a standard romance, and are electing not to see it. However, they could not be more wrong. This film features incredible leading performances, the story of one of the most important men alive today, and an incredible look at life with disease, among other things. I didn't cry during this film, but i was emotionally affected throughout, and was left feeling an assortment of emotion. The Theory of Everything is confident in it's choice, and the end result is an absolutely beautiful film unlike anything you'll see this year."
" Good but could be better
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,7,"A heart wrenching tale that while beautiful is not what it should be. To say I have conflicting feelings about this movie would be an understatement.It is a good movie with brilliant acting. I still believe that Bradley Cooper deserved the Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role Oscar for his part as Chris Kyle in ""American Sniper"" but Eddie Redmayne performance as Stephan Hawking in this film is a close second in my book and I can understand how others would chose Redmayne over Cooper. Felitcity Jones as usual had a great performance with a great range of emotions. On the ten star scale I give it a seven. I do not regret watching it and I would recommend it to others and potentially watch it again. However, despite the positives I cannot help but think of the negatives.I have two major issues with this movie. One the color grading is horrendous. I believe it was intentional and is meant to be part of the visual story telling. Sadly, it fails at providing this as a story element. The color grading ends up just distracting from the film. Blown out shots, overly grainy scenes, unbalanced and unrealistic color pallets will take you out of the movie and remind you are looking at a screen. My second problem is the focus of the story. There was a clear lack of focus on the breakthrough science of Hawkings. It was more focused on the building and failing of his relationship with wife and eventual ex-wife Jane. This alters the film from a celebration of a man's genius to a focus of the betray and betraying that he experiences in his life. I do not believe this was the best use of the time. I wanted more science and less drama.But as I said before I don't regret watching it. You should try watching it yourself. My issues might not bother you like they did me."
" A poignant look at a genius' life
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,8,"It's a shame we lost both Stephen Hawking and Jóhann Jóhannsson in the past year, who both were so vital to this film. Eddie Redmayne completely disappears into the difficult role of Stephen Hawking and deservedly won the Oscar for Best Actor. Jóhannsson's score is beautiful and brings such a sense of wonder and tenderness to the movie. The Theory of Everything is a wonderful peer into the life of such an impactful and inspiring person."
" Totally disappointing
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,2,I really wanted this film to be good and get an insight of the man's life and his intellectual journey but instead it was really about his first wife's life and how hard it was and how good she was. May it was and she was but this is not what I wanted so see and this is not what I was sold. The only redeemable part of the film was the performance of the actors.
" Outstanding
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,9,"Over 4 years after it's release, I just discovered this outstanding film that I rank in my personal top 10 of movies viewed in 2018. Those who rank it less than 7 out of 10 are just plain cynical."
" Amazing and Inspiring (No Spoilers)
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,10,"For those who aren't familiar with the inspiring real-life story of Stephen Hawking (RIP 2018), take a look at his biographical site. This is a person who defied all manner of calculations in work and in life, doing things that no one thought was possible based on the known restrictions of his diagnosed disease, ALS.The movie is very touching and true to the real life story, very worthy of the many awards and nominations. We need more films like this one. Bravo!"
" Astrophysical Soap
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,7,"I would not for one moment take anything away from Eddie Redmayne's excellent performance as Stephen Hawking, or, for that matter Felicity Jones' fine performance as Hawking's first wife, Jane. But the movie presents their romance and struggle more as a well-mounted soap opera than as a biopic of one of the world's foremost scientists. It sometimes comes off as a cheesy disease-of-the-week movie tempered by a rather tawdry love triangle, or quadrangle ((Stephen:Jane:Choirmaster:Penthouse) If you want any knowledge of the professional life and works of Stephen Hawking, you will not find it here. And that is a shame. Because his professional life and work are infinitely more interesting than that of his occasional interest in eyeing a Penthouse magazine or her struggle with her libido. Medmayne deserved his Oscar. But the script let both him and Hawking (and the viewer) down."
" LOOK WHAT WE MADE
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,10,"This film is a brief history of Stephen W. Hawking (Eddie Redmayne), arguably the smartest man of our time or ever. To the Homer Simpson crowd he is known as ""the wheel chair guy."" The film is not only biographical, but gives hope to people with ALS. In circa 1963 Hawking was given two years to live. Apparently God saw fit to give him more time to prove he doesn't exist. You get 25 minutes of Hawking before he is diagnosed.It is also a love story and includes a brief history of his wife Jane (Felicity Jones) who struggled and fell.Hawking is an iconic pop cultural figure too as his book took complex ideas and made them available for the masses. If you watched the film ""God's NOT Dead"" it is Hawking who they parse in an attempt to prove God's existence, i.e. you must prove Hawking wrong first to prove God exists. He is that powerful of a figure.The film omits quite a bit of his life and work, but hits the highlights in an abbreviated and sometimes low budget fashion. For instance we see him enter the chambers to be awarded and then afterwards. We don't see the act itself. Steven also likes to frequent certain type of California adult entertainment establishments. This is reduced to him looking at a Penthouse magazine. The famous runaway wheel chair accident is omitted.If I had one criticism of the film it is the ending when they run the film, i.e. time backwards as it shows the producers have no idea what Hawking really said about reversing time. It couldn't be like that due to the laws of entropy. The smashed glass could not put itself back together. Hawking specifically states this in his book.A movie for science buffs and non-science folk alike.No f-bombs. One Damn. Shows near nudity from an open Penthouse. Some between the lines indications of infidelity."
" Better Than It Should Be
",2018-12-12 00:00:00,7,"Theory of Everything is a perfectly serviceable if largely unremarkable biopic that only works as well as it does because of its uniquely moving portrayal of a marriage naturally growing and falling apart...and because the performances are pretty astonishing. If this wasn't shot in sequential order, then Redmayne is some sort of acting witch."
" STEPHEN HAWKING
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,10,"Outstanding leader of the free world with paralysis covering his body and a vision to devote to science. Surrender, bringer of health and wellness from a digital standpoint with a breakthrough with others like him."
" Stephen Hawking
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because though it is glaringly historically inaccurate it is still a really interesting look into the life of Stephen Hawking. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. Especially by Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones who steal the show as Mr. and Mrs. Hawking. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Fell in love with every bit of this film
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,10,"Right from the very beggining of the film, I was very intrigued by the story itself. And right when I was ready to engage myself to the film, I see Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking, I was already sold to it. I could watch it even if it were 6 or 10 hour long. I have seen so many biopics earlier each had its own place in a way but this one will always stay special to me, the actors, story, narrative, even the landscapes, photography, the very lights in each frame just blew me away. And It wasn't done yet, I still listen to the OST of this film, after 2 years since I saw it, and Arrival of Birds is one of the top played songs on my playlist. I would love to elaborate on the story and how fascinated I was to watch this beautifully crafted film but that wouldn't be called a review, it would be called a thesis, Just kidding. The last few minutes of the film, I had tears in my eyes and the music queues, I couldn't feel my legs after the movie ended and I still love this film to the very core of it. Each actor did the very best of what they could and I can never see any such performance ever again, nor I will ever company any other film, actors, performances or anything with this film.Grandeur!"
" Scince light biopic with a heart
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,8,"This tells the story of Richard Hawking and his wife, and is sensitvely told from all perspectives, the difficulties he faces, as well as those of his wife, as she struggles to care for so long for some one she loves, but ultimately thought would only be alive for a much shorter time. The characters are all sympathetically detailed, so no one is the goodie or the baddie, all just very human, with foibles an failings that they try to overcome. Heart warming."
" Phenomenal acting!
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,7,"I laugh at the reviews that complain of the incorporation of ""very little science"". Have a look at the synopsis before watching the movie - it is about the relationship between Hawking and his wife. It is not about his role in science. Sure, science is sprinkled in there simply because he was a scientist, but that was not the goal for this film.Having known somebody who passed from Lou Gehrig's Disease, this was a heartbreaking movie to watch at times. Even so, it was also inspiring. Of course without significant in-depth research of his personal life and struggle with the disease, I don't know how spot-on facts are, but given Stephen Hawking's accomplishments in the field of physics, I imagine the dedication in his personal life is not far off here.Eddie Redmayne's performance was incredible - I can't imagine it is easy to capture the physical deterioration of Lou Gehrig's Disease. It is not surprising he won an Oscar for this role. If you have any interest in the field of science and/or history and appreciate phenomenal acting, this is for you - Fantastic movie! They even throw in some bits or comedy here and there.Though I do not agree with or believe in his atheism, I still enjoyed this movie because both God and science do exist, and there is something to be said about his brilliant mind (when it comes to science). This part of his life was briefly touched upon a few times in this movie.So why not a 10/10? I have a movie rating system and this simply fits the criteria of a 7 for me."
" Moving!!!!
",2018-10-05 00:00:00,8,"This was so inspirational. What an extraudinary human.
I highly recommend this film. A must see"
" Eddie Redmayne was BRILLIANT!
",2018-09-20 00:00:00,8,"The reason why I give this 8/10 instead of 10/10 is because this movie felt to be about a man with ALS who happens to be brilliant and not the other way around. It's Stephen freaking Hawking! This should have been way more science based, I think. Other than that, it's great! Eddie Redmayne plays the disability AMAZINGLY: The facial expressions, the speech patterns, and even posture were nailed perfectly. There is also a great bit of humor in here that is well timed and doesn't feel inappropriate."
" Your average docu-movie
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,6,"Its premise starts off with a similar vein as movies like a beautiful mind and imitation game, although with varying degrees of difference. I would say the main issue with the movie is that it was archetypal, the audience could guess what would happen next. So how do you portray a movie with an expected outcome? You focus on the mood and the journey instead, and that's what the movie did. With some expressive scenes although I felt some were over dramatized, but overall it worked, it was entertaining. That is why I justify a 6, not a bad movie in its own way but one that doesn't merit much originilaty. Good camera work and scene layouts though."
" Redmayne's performance is still the best Oscar winning performance of the decade!
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,8,"This film is about the life of Stephen Hawking - played by Academy Award winner Eddie Redmayne - and his wife Jane - played by Academy Award Nominee Felicity Jones. When he was at Cambridge, he was diagnosed with Motor Neuron Disease, with the doctors giving him only two years to live. Needless to say, he was distraught. But it was his love for Jane and her love for him that pushed him forward. Needless to say, he lasted way longer than two years. As his condition deteriorated, his mind soared to new heights and he is considered to be one of the best scientists of all time. But it was the struggles and the triumphs with Jane at home that really tested their relationship.You can't review this film and not talk about the phenomenal performance that comes from Eddie Redmayne. I simply cannot say ANYTHING bad about his performance here. He throws himself into the role and his dedication to it was absolutely astounding. Apparently, he sat in that wheelchair for so long that he altered his spine. But in the end, it was worth it, as his dedication and performance earned him the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. It was well earned and well deserved, as his performance reminded me of Daniel Day-Lewis' Oscar winning performance as Christy Brown in My Left Foot. Yes: Redmayne was THAT good.However, what makes this film truly great is that neither of the two leads outshine each other, which brings us to Felicity Jones' performance. Her performance provides the other half of the emotional weight of the film. As Jane, you can see how much she loves Stephen...how much she cares for him...and how much it crushes her to see his condition deteriorate. You can also see the emotional toll that it takes on her, as she balances dealing with a husband whose condition is worsening and kids running around the house. You can see the struggle that she faces while juggling all of these things. While Eddie Redmayne's performance was superb, Felicity Jones was just as good, and both of them provided the story with an amazing amount of drama.Absolutely go and see this movie. Go and see it for these two performances. While there were many great things about this film, it's really Redmayne and Jones that bring out everything great about it. It's the chemistry between them; it's the sadness between them; it's the joyfulness between them; it's everything between them. They are the film, and they truly shine!"
" It's no rocket science, its love story & story that inspires!
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,8,"The movie more than achievements of Stephen hawking is about his personnel life. How he got into wheel chair, his love life and his children. His first wife was a woman who had Faith. Hawking on the other hand was an Athiest. It takes faith and commitment to last this long. I mean till the time their marriage lasted.Hawking was a great person as well. When life threw a bouncer at him in 1963 (diagnosed with degenerative nerve disorder ALS) when he was 21 years old he fought with it. Doctors gave him a few months but he fought till his death in 1918 when he was 76 years old. He inspires a lot of us via that.He wrote a few books and was said to be greatest scientist of his - our time.

" Perfection.
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,10,"If Benedict Cumberbatch had been up for an Oscar in any other year, for his masterful performance in The Imitation Game, he doubtless would have won it. But sadly for him, he was up against Eddie Redmayne in The Theory of Everything, and the result was inevitable.Redmayne's portrayal of Professor Stephen Hawking is mesmerising. He fully and completely inhabits every aspect of the character, with not a trace of his original self evident at any stage. With minimal help from the makeup department, he perfectly metamorphoses into the famously twisted shape of Hawkins, and the resemblance is uncanny. His facial ticks and mannerisms are also spot-on, and he perfectly captures the wicked twinkle in Hawkins' eyes; the eyes of a brilliant man who despite being trapped in a useless body never lost his fine sense of humour.And although Redmayne's performance is one of the greatest displays of acting skill you could hope to see, it does not eclipse the quality of the film itself, which is beautiful, touching, fascinating, funny, heart-warming, and life-affirming. It would be very hard indeed to find a better all-round piece of cinema. Every aspect of it is finely crafted perfection, from screenplay, to direction, to cinematography, to performance, to editing, to music... it is a cinematic feast; for the eyes, for the mind, and for the soul."
" A very true movie and very very superb!
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,9,"The great incredible story of professor Stephen Hawking was sincerely reflected on screen through the The Theory of Everything movie. I have to start with Eddie Redmayne's performance which genuinely exceeds any other performance I have ever seen in my life and in cinema, I really thought for a whole bunch of time I was watching the professor himself especially in his advanced stages of motor neurone disease , It's that kind of performance that still no award is made for it. Felicity did a great job too and had a beautiful chemistry with Eddie. The music of the film was very beautiful and a great companion to the performances and the screenplay was beautiful and careful too. The story only focused on his suffering with a small glimpse about his extraordinary theory and his genius mind which seemed to me as a story of a person that was suffering from a rare disease and was challenging to live and came up with a tremendous theory which could fill some parts where the story was away from him focusing on his wife and how in my opinion she was as he told her in the beginning that she was unaware and taken when she offered that they marry by what she did in the movie in the end of the movie and when he lived more than two years which was so awful and a very bad ending to such a great effort done with such a great person and I would rather It showed any situation including his children and how they dealt with him and how they got used to him in that condition without deviating from his story and facing the disease and how genius he was. In the end the movie is included in the 1001 must watch movies before you die so don't miss it. 8.5/10 with a great salute."
" I'm in tears
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,7,"The Theory of Everything is movie based on biography of well-known scientist Stephen Hawking focusing on a relationship between he and his wife. I personally really love how this film narrates romantic story of Stephen Hawking since people who decide to watch this film probably already know his background. This story narrates mainly on Stephen Hawking and Jane Hawking (his wife) so, it is about story of 2 people. Also, we can see character development through the film. their characters change gradually but still very noticeable and make the audience become emotional and make them want to keep up with the story and support these two people. The casting was perfectly matching with real person even trivial details of the characters, such as personality, the way they act or even clothes. One thing that I have to mention about is the soundtrack of this film. there are many songs that are classical music. In my opinion, the soundtrack suits with its old-school tone very much and of course make the audience become more emotional from the story. If you like romantic movie with vintage costumes and settings, you will definitely like this movie."
" A must see film!
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,9,"A fantastic depiction of Stephen Hawking's life! Based on fact, this was such an emotional film for me, especially with Eddie Redmayne's phenomenally good portrayal as Stephen. Heartbreaking. One of my favorite films of the year."
" What an amazing movie
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,9,This was an absolutely amazing movie. The emotion and acting get straight to the heart. So glad this amazing man was paid the homage that he deserved.
" Infinite genius
",2018-06-05 00:00:00,9,"Eddie Redmayne as Stephen Hawking is brilliant. This biopic has given the layman an illustration of the universe master, Stephen Hawking, how he was as a child,as a student, as a lover, as a husband and as everything. For those of us who are in awe of Stephen and his works, this film is a pretty close depiction of the man and his defiance of his debilitating condition which makes us all wonder if he could have lived longer to see some of his theories proven true. An awesome, humbling film."
" The picture with many missing parts
",2018-05-15 00:00:00,5,"It was obvious that this will be mostly about their romance, marriage, and not about Stephen Hawking's work, ideas. And that was good for me. Beginning was good, not great. What irritated me was that almost constant yellow shine, blurred picture - it should increase idealistic atmosphere, or what ? Anyway, they felt in love, then came horrible news about disease, and Jane proved saying: 'after every successful man, there is a woman' . It was in fast pace, marriage, children came fast, but that was basically a must - when you want to present almost whole life of someone.
Thing became bad after that: 'That was most English thing ...' I don't know how it came - there are choirs in other countries, with plenty of women in . But it sounded well, indeed. So, some other people jumped in their lives, and that was just presented poorly. I was not aware until end text, that they divorced. Whole alienation of couple was not presented well. I guess, they just avoided that unpleasant part. Then was that celebration interview in USA, not really good climax. 
Why he refused knighthood ? - And that was very last text of movie (refusement). Maybe that was because he felt not deserving it because of broken marriage ?
Anyway, this is overrated by me. Acting was fine, camera not, direction OK. But script could do many things better. Only 1 day after, I forgot most of it."
" Sound

" Almost perfect
",2018-04-20 00:00:00,8,"The theory of everything 8/10
My expectation was very high, i was expecting to see a perfect film 
From the title and the story of the film i was hoping to see a scientific film about the famous physicist Stephen Hawking and his theory's, but i got sad disappointed a little bit, the film ignored so much the science and focused on drama and romance mostly which was good , it does tell an inspiring story about Stephen Hawking's personal life and struggles with his health issues
Its could have been perfect if they just added some real science to this film"
" Heavy cinema with a side of science
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,8,"As a glamorized story of perseverance saddled with romance, ""The Theory of Everything"" is a success. At the core this is a dramatization that makes for an emotional journey deliberating the weight of belief in several aspects. No one should judge this as if it ought to be a wealth of information to students of science. If you want facts, do research; don't fall back on drama. At times it was hard to watch; for me that made it more affective. Occasionally cliche, though I expected that. While I would recommend this to select people I am unlikely to revisit it myself. One only needs so much romantic drama, even if it has a few more elements to offer."

" Good Representation of Disability... Under the Circumstances
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,8,"The 2014 film The Theory of Everything, based on Jane Hawking's memoir Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, depicts the life of theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking (Eddie Redmayne). The film does not just focus on Hawking's progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease that causes him to be in a wheelchair and speak through a computer system. It shows his relationship with his ex-wife, Jane Hawking (Felicity Jones), and his successes in physics. ALS is fittingly shown as just one part of Hawking's extraordinary life.The movie has received criticism for casting Redmayne as Hawking and being ""the latest"" performance ""in a long line of what detractors call 'cripping up': able-bodied actors taking on disabled roles, which some critics find as deplorable as the thankfully outdated practice of white actors pretending to be black"". I too would be critical of this casting decision were it not for the special circumstances of this film.The film is meant to reflect Jane Hawking's memoir, a story that shows Hawking's life before and after his diagnosis and through every stage of his ALS's progression. This situation is not identical to a character who is always seen in a wheelchair being played by a nondisabled actor or a character who is born blind being played by a seeing actor. When the circumstances prevent the role of a disabled character from being filled by a disabled actor, there are certain steps that must be taken to ensure that the experiences of disabled people are as accurately portrayed as possible. The Theory of Everything does a very good job of fulfilling this criteria.First of all, Redmayne spent over four months studying Hawking's life, watching every video he could find on him and reading books written by him. Redmayne worked with a choreographer to record and analyze every movement from picking up a pen to drinking to walking. To understand and accurately portray how the disease affected Hawking throughout the different stages, Redmayne met with over 30 people affected by ALS and viewed photographs of Hawking throughout his life.Most importantly, Hawking was consulted during every stage of the movie's production. Redmayne met with him before starting to film, and he visited the set during production. Before the movie was released, Hawking viewed the film and gave his approval. Redmayne's hard work paid off, as Hawking called the film ""broadly true"" and that there were ""certain points when he thought he was watching himself"". After the screening, ""Hawking was so pleased with the movie"" that he let the filmmakers use his own, trademarked computerized voice.In instances when disabled characters cannot be played by disabled actors, it is crucial that people affected by that specific disability are included in the process and that their concerns are listened to. Since everyone's experiences are different, multiple people must be consulted. The experiences of disabled people must not be misrepresented, and the reinforcement of stereotypes must be avoided. The motto of the disability rights movement, ""Nothing about us without us"", applies to media representations as well.When portraying disability, care must be taken to ensure accurate representation and people within the disability community must be included in the process."
" Truly Inspiring!
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,8,"A truly mesmerising performance from Eddie Redmayne, who must have studied every detail to honour the now, late Stephen Hawking.Such an insight into his relentless attitude in the face of adversity, with humour kept intact, it truly proves into some of the most private matters of his life story."
" Focuses on the humour, resilience and love of the expertly portrayed protagonist and his strongest relationship.
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,7,"'The Theory Of Everything (2014) is a rather sweet film, the focus never on anything other than the humour, resilience and underlying love of both the expertly portrayed protagonist and his strongest relationship. This makes the watch an uplifting and generally pleasant one, even though the piece does dip into the darker moments of Hawking's degenerative disease. It's a brilliantly made flick, though the cinematography is consistently dream-like in a slightly distracting way, and it resonates deeply without pushing itself too forcefully upon its audience, finding its footing early on and never making a misstep in telling the remarkable life-story of a remarkable man and the remarkable woman who helped him through it all. 7/10"

" Thought Provoking & Moving
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,8,"The Theory of Everything... There Is One Thing To Say I That Is That Stephen Hawking Is Just Simply Genius Played By A Genius Actor Eddie Redmanye. The Story It's Self Is Very Moving And Thought Provovking. Many Would Expect This Film To Be Broadly Based On Hawking's Scientific Theorys. It Wasnt Broadly Based On Science But Is Still A Very Good Film Which Fails To Disapoint Due To The Moving Performances From The Leading Cast, Eddie Redmanye And Felicity Jones. Whilist The Film May Not Be What You Expect, You Still Will Not Be Dissapointed."
" The Theory of Almost Everything
",2018-01-26 00:00:00,7,"Saw 'The Theory of Everything' as someone who like biographical dramas (even if a lot play liberties with the truth), especially the inspiring ones that have a lot of emotional impact (and there are plenty of those out there), and who was interested in both the subject matter and Stephen Hawking himself. The trailer was also appetising and then there was the awards attention.After finally seeing it, after it being on my long ""to see"" list that got bigger and bigger, as my music and course commitments grew, for a while, found 'The Theory of Everything' a good film with several superb elements that could have better considering the subject. While critically praised, audience reaction leans towards the more positive but more divisive for reasons that are understandable, being someone who agrees with a few of the criticisms if not all. There is the agreement that 'The Theory of Everything', being based on his first wife's memoir meaning there is a lot of his personal life, could have focused more on what made Hawking so brilliant as a scientist/cosmologist, how he contributed to the subject with his theories, his importance to it and how he was perceived, there wasn't enough of that. Another criticism that is shared by me is the rushed and jumpy nature of the narrative as a result of trying to cram a lot and there is the sense that in doing that that it tried to do too much. However, 'The Theory of Everything' is photographed and designed beautifully, while it's sensitively directed, by someone who clearly had a passion and sympathy for what was focused on, and hauntingly scored.It is a thoughtfully written film and explores his heavily-focused on personal life with delicacy, little one-sidedness and a lot of charm and emotional power (motor neurone disease is a horrific condition to suffer from and that was handled heart-wrenchingly). Also found myself inspired and learning a good deal. Eddie Redmayne gave one of that year's best performances, a truly poignant and powerful performance and a career best thus far. His make-up is remarkable. Felicity Jones is the emotional back-bone of the story in a way and it is just as much about her as it is with him, and her acting is subtle and warm while showing Jane as having as as many flaws as she did strengths. The chemistry between them has a lot of heart.Charlie Cox, David Thewlis and Maxine Peake are strong support but it's the two leads' show all the way.All in all, good film that could have been a great one. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
" A love story that transcends the traditional genre
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,8,"Although it's not a true genre, Memoir/True Story is a methodology for writing a biography. Mixed with Drama, which shows the intimacy of characters in a web and a strong moral dilemma that ""blows"" in the Climax Sequence, the Memoir/True Story is like a detective story. Uncovering clues to a person's psyche is the detective aspect of this genre. And when one uncovers enough clues and is able to arrive at ""the truth,"" what oftentimes happens is that ""the truth"" can be problematic. In the case of The Theory of Everything, the wife of Stephen Hawking made the conscious, if not romantic decision to ""stand by her man."" A religious woman by nature, this entered into her decision as well. After 25 years of devotion, with literally life-threatening decisions she had to make while a parent of three of their children, they end in divorce. The flip or transcendence of the usual beats of a deteriorating marriage are as follows: Stephen is not a disabled man in his heart or brain. His wife helped him to rise above that depression, which would have killed him had she not been by his side. His wife is not just a ""caregiver"" bleeding heart, but rather, a deeply spiritual woman who rose above what most young women look for in a marriage partner. This giving nature caused her to grow with an enormous character arc. She walked away from a long adulterous relationship when Stephen's life hung in the balance and she knew where her duties lay. Stephen knew where her heart really was though after many years of marriage. He was saddened by it, but he had an enormous respect for his wife's courage and strong moral values. The third transcendence occurred when Stephen finds himself falling in love with his new caregiver. He is a man falling in love - not a disabled, helpless victim. This is new to him and it empowers him. The caregiver replaces his wife in emotional importance. It's an evolution that is both poignant and painful at the same time. Both characters grow in wisdom and respect for one another. The concept of ""time"" is woven into this script as a type of symbol. Whether time goes forward or backward is not of the essence. Time is a chronological measure of growth and happiness. The real measure is ephemeral and everlasting. The two characters go through a moral epiphany that is called a Double Reversal at the end of the story. Stephen pushed away the possibility to survive in the beginning. In the end, he believes that his horizons are endless. Jane was committed to a moral and ethical way of behavior with a man at any cost in the beginning. In the end, she allows herself to follow her heart."
" A Grand Story of Love
",2018-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Is an astonishing story filled with love and sadness but wouldn't be as great as it is without the amazing talent of Eddie Redmayne showing the true emotion that Hawking went through, with his competition of love with a woman and love of science, while also trying to fight an unstoppable disease. which this movie is definitely a show of Hawking's personal life that should be known by everyone in a way that people will respect and understand what he had went through."
" It's about Everything...
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,9,Aah actually no to say anything... it was just greatA movie.... Not actually a movie but it really feels real situation How sir Stephen's life GROWN not like other scientists... but an Unique who have proved his theory wrong just to prove his theory. And also that is called a real love from Jane. This movie is really sensitively attached with every scene and I just loved it.How willpower does he has! Not imaginable...I'm actually loved the last scenes... How director has knew what we need that time... And for satisfaction he once made Stephen sir to get up from the chair... How lovely was that! And in last he has proved his intelligence with revising the whole movie till the first scene when Jane met Hawking.And truly emotionally attached it me with all the life he had. There is no negative point of this movie and really when I'm writing this I watched it twice to get more emotional....But I gave it 4 and half ratings... But the half rating is cut for they haven't shown us HOW HE DISCOVERED HIS THEORY. His efforts and to researches those are lacing part.. but still it's the best movie I have seen ... So i am gonna watch it again... What by you?
" Not as good as I'd hoped: too far from reality
",2017-10-23 00:00:00,6,"First and foremost, it is a movie about Hawking's wife, not himself. After all it's based on her autobiographical book, not his. So there is very little science, all things considered, which was kinda disappointing. You know very little about his colleagues, about his own discoveries. The actors are great, and some scenes are memorable though. But all in all it was disappointing in one particular aspect: accuracy.It shows Hawking as very understanding, and as his wife sacrificing everything once she knows he has the disease. Except she KNEW he was sick BEFORE dating him in real life, while the movie shows the opposite... Moreover, you don't feel the years she had to suffer taking care of himself and the kids alone while he refused exterior help. In the movie you feel like the first time he sees her suffering he says ""ok we need help"". That is not what happened. This is the issue when you wanna show a period of 40 years in one movie, you can't show all the suffering and disputes, as it would be too much to take in for the audience. I've heard that Hawking had a great sense of humor which is shown here, but I've also heard that he can be a jerk, and you don't see that here at all. It's too mellow, despite the disease, and the complex platonic relationship with Jonathan. It's also too Americanised: a lot of orchestral music to trigger emotions at specific moments, I hate that.It was the exact same issues with Les Intouchables: the music is too present, and they don't show the reality. In the real story of Les Intouchables, Omar Sy's character was closer to a real criminal, was violent. Once there is a discussion where you hear ""maybe we should tone it down for the public"" it's over, you can't make a great movie out of it."
" A Brief 2 Year History of Time.
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,7,"I wonder if not showing the timeline was in an attempt to somehow, artistically, represent Hawking's theory of time? If so, it would be a rather neat touch, and an appropriate and appreciable nod to Hawking's Bestseller.Though this movie does suck one in quite a bit, it really did break my heart, in a manner that diminishes the film, and that too, sucks quite a bit. What's heartbreaking isn't necessarily Stephen's disease, though it is incredibly sad; no, what's heartbreaking is his and Jane's separation. It was inevitable from the moment she said she loves him, and the reason their divorce ruins this film - besides the fact that The Theory of Everything feels a lot like a story of love, is because she truly did, but life, as it loves to do and do so incredibly, unbelievably, amazingly and breathtakingly well, got in their way.After all those years of her taking such good care of him, their kids and their unity, for it to end period, almost demonstrates the uselessness and power of time. Maybe it's because it's a biography, but it really is quite dispiriting.Also, I feel as though this film arguably, somewhat brings Stephen Hawking's integrity into question. Jane could've left, but she didn't, however, the first chance Stephen got seemingly, and not that he did it purposefully, he left. Maybe Jane stayed out of obligation, but, did Stephen also then not owe her the same courtesy?With all of that said, Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones exhibit some wonderful performances, and Johann Johannsson's composition is heartrending... It's moving. 7.3/10."
" Oddly hollow
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,6,"I was really enthused about watching THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING, the Stephen Hawking biopic featuring an Oscar-winning performance from Eddie Redmayne. I had previously watched and loved the excellent IMITATION GAME with Benedict Cumberbatch, and was hoping for something similar. Imagine my surprise, then, when I discovered that this movie features Hawking as a supporting character while his wife takes centre stage. The reason is that it's adapted from a book that Hawking's wife wrote.No offense to Mrs. Hawking, but I have little interest in seeing her life and the cheesy Mills and Boons moments with Charlie Cox (as much as I like him) play out. I want to see Hawking, and I want to hear about his theories on the universe. There's little to no science present here, leaving the experience oddly hollow. THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING's saving grace is Redmayne himself, who delivers a gruelling, exhausting, incredibly accurate portrayal of a man gripped by disability and defying the odds at every turn; he fully deserved his Oscar and gives the best portrayal of disability I've seen in a movie since INSIDE I'M DANCING. It's just a pity that, Redmayne aside, the film is quite average."
" Brilliantly acted but questionable direction
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,7,"'The Theory of Everything', a biographical film about British genius Stephen Hawking, doesn't do a lot wrong in a technical sense. It's very well written and produced with an excellent performance from Eddie Redmayne as Hawking. The film details the early years of Stephen's life, from his diagnosis with ALS disease to the complex relationship he has with his wife.My only query - and it is more of a query than criticism - is why there was so little time given for Hawking's actual thoughts and theories. We probably learn more about Hawking's wife and what she's thinking than Hawking himself, which is disappointing. After all, the film is titled 'The Theory of Everything', so one would have expected there to be a lot more focus on Hawking's actual theory."
" Eddie Redmayne's best performance!
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,9,"What a great film this was! Clearly Eddie Redmayne's best performance! He was very convincing in portraying the famous physicist Stephen Hawking. James Marsh nailed the directing of this film, and it certainly had its breathtaking moments! I didn't expect much seeing the previews, except looking forward to Eddie Redmayne's performance, but the overall story-line was great and the entire film executed well. It's a well deserved 9/10 from me!"
" Theory behind the theory
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,7,"Stephen Hawking was an enigma. How could this extremely intelligent man continue to research whilst suffering with MND? His condition whilst extremely disabling never defined him, as he was lucky enough to have impressive support from his family and friends which allowed him to stay committed to his interests. This film shows the onset of the disease and the story of his life from the time period he was at Cambridge University researching for his PhD. I'm not going to spoil the story but it is one of highs and lows - much like everyone else's lives, but ultimately illustrates what is possible in the face of adversity. I'd have scored this higher if it hadn't become like snippets the further towards the end of the film - I know getting everything in to a standard movie length can be a challenge but I'd have liked this to be bulked out a little more. Eddie Redmayne is the greatest young talent we have these days and deserved his Academy award for Best Actor. This is a heartwarming and interesting biog and love story, but it's not in an ""in-your-face"" way. If you have a couple of hours free and get the chance to watch it just sit back, watch and chill."
" Brief History of Hawking's Time
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,6,"Diagnosed with an incurable debilitating disease, British scientist Stephen Hawking defies odds and continues his important research, even after losing the ability to speak, in this biographical drama from acclaimed documentarian James Marsh. Credibly capturing Hawking's gradually declining health, Eddie Redmayne won an Oscar for his performance, but it is actually co-star Felicity Jones who has the film's best moments as his wife, struggling to remain strong and not cave into a desire for normality. She has a particularly touching part in which she tries to get her resistant husband to use a 'spelling board'. Given that the film is based on Jane Hawking's autobiographical account of her time with her ex-husband, it is unsurprising that Jones is given such a juicy character and so much focus; the film is equally about her as Hawking. And yet, Marsh's attempts to balance the film being about both leads to it falling short as an insight into the mind of the scientific genius. Hawking's theories are often pushed into the background compared to something like 'A Beautiful Mind' which had plenty of scenes dedicated to John Nash's thought processes. Supported by an excellent Jóhann Jóhannsson score and detailed sets and costumes, this is certainly a handsome production, but those interested in a film more about Stephen than Jane Hawking may need to look elsewhere."
" A wonderful Biography of a wonderful man
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,10,"The life of a young, brilliant student gets thrown apart when he finds out that he has about two years left, as a result of a terrible, regressive disease. Decided not to give up, with the help of his future wife, he starts working on his PhD, bringing into the world some theories never heard before. Although encountering many problems along the way, especially when talking about his health, he continues to amaze the world with his research, so many people come to bring him hope or even technical help, which will allow him to communicate and ultimately aid him in his pursuit of finding an unique and simple equation which will solve everything.It's a dramatic biography of one of the most brilliant minds the world has ever seen, filled with suspense, love, friendship, struggle but also relief and success. It manages to transmit a lot of emotion, the main actor having a flawless interpretation throughout the entire movie. His performance alone makes this movie a must see, let alone its plot and characters."
" This is a really nice movie
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,7,"When I first saw this movie, I couldn't watch it all the way through. It seemed boring, set in Cambridge in the 1960s, and the script and backdrops seemed quite monotonous. But on second viewing, I found it generally an entertaining film. It's the story of brilliant scientist Stephen Hawking's diagnosis with motor neurone diseas in his early 20s - and his subsequent persistence in getting on with life, and becoming a world famous celebrity physicist. The scientific aspects, to me, are still very weak. I.e. I feel they could have been explained in more detail, although still in a simple way, so we got some information about Hawking's work. However the acting, including Eddie Redmayne as Hawking, and Felicity Jones as his wife, Jane, is exemplary. Redmayne displays an extraordinary technical mastery and empathy with Hawking's disability, and Jones inhabits her role beautifully. Jane seems to have saved Hawking's life, several times, not least in how she convinced him, and enabled him, to not just exist, but to participate in life. I feel that their breakup was probably sanitised somewhat. Not much bitterness or sadness is portrayed, just a few tears, then getting on with life with new partners. The actor who played Jane's choirmaster love interest was great, and the relationship is portrayed in a tasteful way. I felt that this movie did justice to an extraordinary true story. It was well done."
" The Theory of Everything
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,7,"'The Theory of Everything' is James Marsh's biopic of scientific genius Stephen Hawking. Eddie Redmayne plays Hawking as we learn about his early days at university, his diagnosis of motor neuron disease, and the rise to his now iconic status. Marsh's direction is very good and he uses many point of view shots to create a huge sense of empathy for the main character. Marsh uses stunning visual effects in order to express Hawking's inner feelings and torment whilst highlighting his genius. The choice of music is also uplifting and echoes the key themes throughout the film.The screenplay is a really interesting piece of work and tells the story in a funny yet intriguing way. However, it does seem to lack a certain something as it tries to alter the source material in order to create some very conventional scenes.The performances in 'The Theory of Everything' are truly exceptional. Eddie Redmayne plays Stephen Hawking in a transformational and moving manner. You can barely recognise him as he highlights his illness with complete sincerity and plausibility. Felicity Jones plays his wife, Jane Wilde. I thought her role would be a simple one as she would work off of the powerhouse performance from Redmayne but the way she shows her strength and compassion is very moving and she does an excellent job.Overall, 'The Theory of Everything' is a fascinating film about a genius as he deals with his dibilitating illness. The maturity of everyone involved in this make it a remarkable movie."
" Whyy ???? don't waste your time this movie in 3 words Steven don't know how to eat or drink his wife want to sleep with an other guy he visit the queen
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,7,I found this movie to be very thin.This is a quite boring and traditionally made biopic of Steven Hawking.I was hoping it would be showing us more of an insight into the brilliant mind of Steven.It does not.It's subject is more or less: how to cope & go on living with a very disabled person as a spouse.I'v understood that the base of the film was the book by Jane hawking Stevens wife.Although one might say that the main character gives us good acting....it brings us nothing.IMO.it's just a sentimental 13 in a dozen biopic and never original. a missed opportunity!It would be far more interesting if we got more offered why Steven Hawking is such an immensely important scientist.
" Redmayne's Mannerisms...
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,5,"Redmayne did not deserve an Oscar for his collection of mannerisms. Michael Keaton gave a masterclass in Acting in his performance in ""Birdman."" Redmayne is a novice. Keaton is a veteran. The Academy made another mistake. That said, ""Birdman"" won best picture. The success of the movie was due to Keaton who was on screen constantly. Redmayne's win was a sympathy vote. Keaton won at the Golden Globes. It's ironic that the Foreign Press recognized the American actor. It will be a long time before Redmayne wins again. ""The Theory of Everything"" was a win for Stephen Hawking, not for the actor who played him. Redmayne did an imitation based on mannerisms. Keaton gave an inspired and original performance based on years of experience."
