" Sound problems
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,5,"Too many scenes where the music, street noise, or background noise overwhelms the dialogue."
" Laugh at old age and laugh at youth
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,8,"A classic New York comedy with all the stylization of Noah Baumbach and the always necessary dose of drama and reflection on modern life.The film has its axis and its motor in the generational clash between youth and those who are already crossing the forties, which is clear from the first opening dates. 'While We're Young' may be too much of a difference between generations, to the point of exaggeration. However, his actors keep this from looking quite like that, delivering very charismatic performances (Ben Stiller is especially good here, rarely has he been better).
This generates once again that complementary relationship between director and actor that is so common in Baumbach's films and that always comes handy for the viewer to identify.The film works in several ways, both as a short and fun story to pass the time or for those more demanding, it also works as an ironic portrait of the passage of time, maturing and old age. What doubt is there? Baumbach does it again."
" I wondered what happened to Ben Stiller
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,5,"There was a time when Ben Stiller was an actor whose films I really looked forward to. To me he was a talented Adam Sandler. After watching this film, I realize why I drifted away from Stiller. This film stinks! One of the worst films I've ever forced myself to sit through.Perhaps a minor point to some, I really don't want to watch multiple people vomiting. No thanks. I'll pass on that. Thank goodness for fast forward.I understand what the point of the film was. But the longer I watched it, the more I wanted to vomit.I have to admit that I've been no fan of Adam Driver. And after watching this film...I'm even less of a fan. I don't understand the attraction. Is it that he doesn't look like a leading man?I typically find Amanda Seyfried rather pleasant. She was fine here. But I felt sorry for her to have gotten stuck in this clunker.I'd like to tell you one thing I liked about the film. But I can't. That's how bad I felt this film was. Maybe the ""telling off"" scene at the end of the film was sorta good. It was a long time to wait."
" 7/10 from me
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,7,"Something different... we're not used for something like this when there's Ben Stiller.
Interesting, but a little bit boring...
And the end is very... I don't know ðŸ˜’ðŸ˜¶"
" Surprised Me in the a Good Way
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,9,"It has really dawned on me how much Noah Baumbach is influenced by Woody Allen. Had I not known, I would have thought this was WA. This is like upper medium good Woody. WA meets Eve Harrington. This is the best thing I've ever seen Ben Stiller do. Naomi Watts is consistently excellent. Adam Rich is spot on. There's a lot more going on then war of the generations. Stiller gives a particularly nuanced performance. My only beef would be the climax- things got a bit melodramatic. Also as much as I enjoyed it, it felt long. I'm never truly satisfied but this came close."
" Boring.......
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,6,The movie is out of story and I didn't know what it actually meant. It was boring and dragging. There were humour moments usual Ben stiller style which couldn't save the movie. Apart from good acting the movie is just were it started till the end it didn't move on
" An adequate serio-comic treatment which shies away from being too close to home
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,6,"""At the same age of Josh in the movie, Baumbach's self-reflexive instinct posits the story mostly from a flustered Josh's viewpoint, and Stiller is mildly exasperating for unable to act more sympathetic as the cynosure here, while the narrative around Watts' Cornelia, unfortunately still being predominantly defined by her womb (they would be fantastic parents!) and the two men in her life (her father and her husband, plus what is her occupation anyway?), is more amorphous, the same can be applied to Seyfried's Darby, under the shadow of Jimmy's faux-bonhomie and faux-naÃ¯f facade, she becomes a mere cipher and introduced as someone who makes ice cream, whereas Driver naturalistically codes Jimmy's unpretentious effusion with a shady self-consciousness might be bypassed by more gullible viewers.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
" Not perfect, but an uneven and surprisingly entertaining social satire
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,8,"A bit pretentious at times, but clever and fantastically acted- While We're Young may not be the home run the film thinks it is, but is certainly a well illustrated period piece and a wonderful social satire. Ben Stiller and Adam Driver are fantastic, truly delving into their characters to likes I haven't seen them before. The whole cast itself is also quite impressive, with Naomi Watts also providing quite a notable performance. The film is surprisingly entertaining, and paced fairly well, but at times can feel like two different films by its end. To sum it up, the film starts and ends in very different spot, and though it is important to see character growth and plot progression in films, it just feels a bit odd how different the film feels by its conclusion- and you can't help but feel Bumbach didn't entirely realize what to do to wrap it up. Besides that fact, and it's somewhat pretentious nature, While We're Young is written very well in terms of dialogue and social satire, and proves to be a very revealing and realistic look into the world it wants to provide a glimpse into. In the end, While We're Young is not great, but a well-enough executed piece from Bumbach that is certainly memorable, unique, and luckily very entertaining.
My Rating: 8.5/10"
" Like a dÃ©jÃ -vu.
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,7,"To me While We're Young wasn't bad. It's an entertaining and easy movie to watch but I had like a dÃ©jÃ -vu when watching this story. I'm sure I didn't watch this specific movie before, and I certainly didn't read the book, but still there must be another movie with the same story, or at least about the same because I knew exactly what was going to happen. But it doesn't really matter, wouldn't be the first time, and certainly won't be the last time we had a remake, I just wished I could remember the title of that movie. The acting was good in While We're Young, good cast so it's kind of normal to have quality acting. In short, this movie is worth a watch, you can't really go wrong with this one."
" ""Life is what happens while making other plans""
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,8,"Interesting approach to mature age and the process to adapt to it, through an intergenerational comparison between ""generation x"" and ""millennials"" raised by Noah Baumbach using two documentary filmmakers and their partners as characters in his film, ""While we're Young""
In addition to the topic of maturity, the director shows us the different responses and behaviors of the generations to a specific topic: the making of a documentary. And the differences emerge: on one hand, generation x, with a great obsession in the search for truth, to deliver a pristine and unquestionable documentary legacy and, in contrast, the young filmmaker, doing whatever is necessary to resolve it, without any prejudice, just looking to do a well accomplished and enjoyable job.
Aside from arguing over generations, the central theme is to meditate on age and plans for living life, as well as your capacity for acceptance and coexistence with others.
His ability as a writer and screenwriter is demonstrated with several phrases in the film, I quote one of them at the beginning, as the title of my review.
""While We Are Young"" is a very well outlined film, worthy of analysis and which also fits into its theme regarding human interaction in his native New York in the 21st century.
Sharp, both his last image about the new generations, as well as his final phrase:
""He is not evil, he is just young""
Script by Noah Baumbach
The cast includes: Ben Stiller, Naomi Watts, Adam Driver, Amanda Seyfried.
The cast is perfect since it makes the characters seem to be more dull, 'as is' and make those who must also appear so more entertaining and dynamic."

" A Puzzling and Dissatisfying Third Act Cannot Derail this Charming Dram-Com
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,7,"Watching people realizing they're no longer young and hip naturally lends itself well to humor, drama, and self-examination, but the subject matter alone doesn't always naturally lend itself to a neatly formed story. The writer/director has to handle that part. Good thing this movie has Noah Baumbach.Baumbach brings a knowing touch to this film, always seeming to strike a fitting balance between humor, drama, and analysis, all without ever feeling heavy handed or condescending. He allows his characters to show viewers the dichotomy of a young, idealistic (Adam Driver and Amanda Seyfried) juxtaposed against the aging couple (Ben Stiller and Naomi Watt) who have lost a bit of luster but are a bit in denial about their quasi-happiness.After the couples meet and become fast friends, it's the older couple who draws inspiration from the young. They slip right back into their own youthful beliefs about the world and how they should exist in it. Some of their thoughts are meaningful, while others are sappy and, well, juvenile. Despite recognizing the silliness of the young couple's lifestyle, like watching VHS tapes and listening to records just because, it's easy as a viewer to fall under their spell. Driver and Seyfried are effortlessly charming, and their exuberance and self-certainty make them appealing role models.The epiphany about how to live life that the young couple gives to the older one is a little too easy and convenient. Something must be off. Baumbach was simply reeling us in, making us listen more closely as he continues his story.This is where the most crucial part of the movie arrives, and it's the one Baumbach handles with less success. Just as the salient message of the movie should be coming into focus, the story instead veers swiftly towards a grumpy take on the ethics of documentary filmmaking.The third act is a little unsatisfying, but it is certainly not enough to erase what is on the whole an intelligent, humorous and enjoyable movie."
" Not a comedy movie
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,5,"I didn't had any laugh while watching this movie on top of that it's boring and feels kinda lengthy,casting is nicely done but the story doesn't even catch up with the background music ."
" Movie for Everyone
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,8,"Everyone can relate to this movie in one way or another. From the go-getting attitude of young couple Jamie (Adam Driver) and Darby (Amanda Seyfried) to the older seeking couple of Cornelia (Naomi Watts) and Josh (Ben Stiller). Writer and Director Noah Baumbach does an amazing job of addressing complex themes through an interesting story.Jamie is a man after his own tastes. He wants a successful career doing something he loves while knowing how to play the politics of business. This character may be set up to be more a villain type towards the end but I can't help but sympathize and understand him. He wants friends, and thinks of Josh as his friend but he has an agenda, and Adam Driver delivers this perfectly.Josh is on the other side of the spectrum. He has been stuck in a mundane routine for almost a decade, never really recognizing the passing of time. When Jamie and Darby come along suddenly he feels this energy he never had before. This gives him a new sense of understanding about himself and the world around him. Showing that your never too old or young to learn from others.Both of these characters exhibit universal qualities that are personal to everyone. While I usually like to focus on the acting, soundtrack, and technological aspects of a movie this one makes me think without pulling me out of the story. Using the different characters to show me the different ways of the worldOverall it was a very good movie. Great for a rainy day or cold night in front of the television. I would recommend it to anyone. You will get a good story, and maybe learn a little something."
" Film that praises today's narcissistic mentality and mistakens it for youth
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,4,"The film has a good start and seems promising but as we go further and we understand that Jamie (Driver's character) is morally ambiguous ,things start to get confusing. What the 40 year old couple was seeing in the young, creative and passionate couple doesn't exist, as we discover that they are faking everything.
Driver's character could be the perfect example of a person affected by a narcissistic personality disorder, manipulating his benefactors and friends to obtain personal profit, with no sense of guilt for his lying even when caught, and no care for anyone (including his spouse) but for himself (""Jamie cares only for Jamie"" says his wife). Everyone around him is just a tool for his success.
But what is upsetting is that this ,in the end, doesn't really seem to care anyone! Naomi's father ,the great film maker who had a public speech about the meaning of integrity in documentaries, now says it's ok, Driver's act isn't a crime ...! Even to Ben's character (who is surprisingly so immature that fails to make his point on why is wrong to deceive people and enforce this opinion) seem to care less in the end when he admits that (referring to Driver's character) ""you 're right. He's not a bad person. He's just young!"" This way he buries his dignity even deeper and he accepts both the role of a victim and a failure.
This film teaches us that youth = being a narcissist and it is ok to lie and deceive if you are young...Plus ,people in their forties are totally naive and useless and the fact that a person keeps his integrity is not of much value but even worst: is actually a weakness similar to aging... because being honest and real can't bring you success.
I think the movie doesn't really do justice to the characters of Ben and Naomi ,and this is a huge dissatisfaction. They don't really discover or even understand where their true value and their authentic way lies as someone would expect from the ending. But they seem to accept Driver's victory and continue their boring life hoping that a baby will solve everything. What a cliche'..."
" Interesting concept solid story
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,6,"Described as a comedy, While We're Young is quite an interesting concept of a drama comedy type film. Having enjoyed other films by director Noah Baumbach, Greenberg, and the Meyerowitz Stories was expecting something on a similar level.The acting is fine, there are parts of intrigue as a whole but overall this film is somewhat slightly above average. It was relatively tame and perhaps had it went a little darker, could have been better and more interesting. The slight ""twist"" in the end is some what predictable and expected."
" Amusing but nothing memorable
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,5,"Ben Stiller are and Naomi Watts are in their forties, living in New York and seemingly happy. They befriend two young hipsters and enjoy the idea of feeling young again, cool clothes, new ideas and parties but their cross generational friendship eventually sours when Adam Driver shows his true colours. I found this pretty dull, a good cast, some funny moments with the older couple trying to be cool and the hipsters looking like losers in their pretentious aloofness. Amusing I guess but not memorable in any way."
" Utterly and Completely Inauthentic in Every Conceivable Way
",2019-10-04 00:00:00,1,Nothing about this tedious movie is truthful. The writing is so self-consciously hip that it calls attention to the writing and not the story or the characters. The acting is atrocious. Every actor says their lines but there is absolutely no emotional connection between any character with any other character. No chemistry anywhere. The situations are contrived and cringeworthy. Hip hop dance class for the 43 year old that leads to her hip hopping during a phone conversation and encouraging her preternaturally aged 44 year old husband (Ben Stiller was too old for the role. ) to do the same. Nope. A retreat where everyone vomits up their demons. Nope. Pet chickens. Nope. Anything that happens in this movie is a big Nope Nope Nope. We paid 99 cents to watch this movie. We were robbed.
" Better than it first appeared
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,7,"It began with some of the usual Hollywood light humour, but turned out to represent a far more perceptive view of relationships. The depiction of (the awfulness of) hipster lifestyle was excellent, though maybe a little over the top. In particular l liked the fact that when the primary protagonist entered a hall where a tribute ceremony was taking place, it did not consist of the usual disrupted ceremony due to the exposure, which we were expecting. The actual scenario was much more real and believable. In all a satisfying movie, with good real world humour and believable people."
" A grown-up drama with the watchability of a rom-com and the tension of a classic whodunit
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,7,"Indie king, Noah Baumbach returns to helm the closest thing to a rom-com he'd ever put his name to, directing Ben Stiller, Naomi Watts and newest gawkily handsome anti-leading man on the block, Adam Driver.While We're Young captures middle-aged couple, Cornelia and Josh (Stiller and Watts) in a period of flux where friends their own age are disappearing down the baby rabbit-hole, leaving them to hitch their wagon to bewitching hipster couple Jamie and Darby (Driver and Amanda Seyfried).Josh's insecurities surrounding his flailing career as a documentarian lead him down a path of paranoia as he convinces himself Jamie is posing as an adoring fan while ruthlessly trying to get to his famous father-in-law in order to boost his own star.The first half hour is a whirlwind of vintage bicycles, home-made ice cream and street parties as Cornelia and Josh push to try and keep up with their new twenty-something friends but a serious lull must be endured before a final build to the gut-wrenchingly awkward finale of double-crossing, amateur sleuthing and shrill revelations.Stiller's internal rifts are expertly played out by the seasoned actor, who carries his youthful counterpart's (purposefully) flighty performance.
Save for the disappointing middle-section, While We're Young is a grown-up drama with the watchability of a rom-com and the tension of a classic whodunit - a departure into real-life for the usually fantastical Baumbach.

" Torture and not a comedy
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,2,"I got 30 mins in and had to turn it off it was just to cringey.
I was expecting a comedy and all i got was a movie trying to hard out of desperation to be cool."
" Conversation driven film with attractive stars, voluminous ideas; sophisticated viewers will like it
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,8,"In Greenwich Village, documentary filmmaker Josh (Ben Stiller) and his lovely wife, Cornelia (Naomi Watts) are not happy with their lives, at the moment. Now in their early forties, they tried for years to become parents and, despite thinking they had let this dream go, they are suddenly pondering it again. This is largely due to close friends of the same age group who have just welcomed their first child. Strong emotions come rushing back. More importantly, Josh is having trouble completing his latest film which bothers Cornelia a great deal. Perhaps this is because her father Leslie (Charles Grodin) is also a famous creator in the non-fiction film category who could help Josh but the younger man insists on going it alone. One day, as Josh delivers a guest lecture at a college nearby, he is startled to find two folks auditing his class. They are Jamie (Adam Driver) and Darby (Amanda Seyfried) a married couple who shower Josh with praise for his previous work. Whoa, how nice is this! Jamie, in fact, admits he aspires to the same type of career and would love to hobnob with Josh to learn pointers. Soon, the foursome are meeting for dinner at Jamie and Darby's place, where J &C discover a bohemian atmosphere they admire. Not only that, the younger couple ride bikes everywhere and many zany interests. Even though its difficult, Josh and Cornelia try to keep up. They all attend a mystical weekend event, take mind-altering drugs and let loose. But, truth is important to Josh and he soon finds Jamie likes to fabricate parts of the truth if it suits him and his situation. In fact, was Jamie ever interested in being friends are just picking brains? This conversation driven film has its moments of humor and life lessons that make it attractive to the sophisticated film viewer. Also, the stars are terrific, not only the main actors, but all of the supporting cast as well. Those who love Manhattan will enjoy the many sights and sounds of a vibrant city. Do you see yourself as a film fan who likes Woody Allen and other movies where conversations are everything? You will like this one."
" This movie is HILARIOUS.
",2019-03-21 00:00:00,8,"Noah Baumbach and this cast nail it here. Every scene shows in detail the idiosyncrasies of millennial culture vs. gen x-ers', both embarrassing & hilarious in it's accuracies. I simultaneously feel like I've been found out as a city dwelling millennial while laughing at how simple cultures of young & coming-on middle aged people feel compelled to act out their day-to-day lives.I suppose this one isn't for everyone, but if you live in any of the major cities in the US, you will find this HILARIOUS.From alternative warehouse turned apartment living to documentaries on working class America made by pseudo-intellectual upperclass white men, this film shows how hilariously simple we all are in thinking how unique and progressive our journeys in life are, all the while keeping the heartfelt storyline that Baumbach has always been doing so well."
" Aren't the middle aged so obnoxious?
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,9,"This is a lovely movie really, it is at least equanimous in its portrayal of the younger and the old - all sides are in a way quite unlikeable! Here, it's the young with thier ruthlessness and blind ambition, and the olders dragging a resentment of the young and a fathomless nostalgia everywhere. For me the film with its many little facets offers at least as much edification as entertainment, but with some really funny moments like the tantric mescaline vomiting party and the paralysed sexuality of the the lead couple. Ben Stiller seems really good at being quite so mixed up at 44, having achieved very little creatively. The young folk are intriguing and cool, but again it's hard to find a really likeable character anywhere, but it's redeemed for me by the philosophy, the psychological insight, and the gentle sustained comedy. The truth be told, we middle aged are not always easy to like - we're fussy and tedious. The tacked on unessessry ending can't disguise the fact."
" Lighthearted portrait of midlife crisis facing grumpy adults who wanna be young and happening again. They wont be.
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,7,"Fans of the big blockbuster Ben Stiller comedies wont like this movie, because this certainly is NOT a straight comedy. It's more a grumpy portrait, with a few lighthearted jokes sprinkled across. Some of the jokes work, some fall flat. Best suited for older folks or for an arthouse audience that is more open minded to these subtle tongue in cheek jokes about a midlife crisis facing couple, who wanna be young and happening again. But they wont be. And they'll soon find out, after they clumsily are trying to mix in with youngsters well below their age.The lead up of this story is rather funny. The second half is somewhat missing in focus. It suddenly wants to be a little drama, but it just isnt very convincing. All in all, still an amusing portrait of all the insecurities that fall upon older folks who are facing a midlife crisis and are in full denial about it..."
" life at a different stage
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that the people you meet can change your outlook on life but also as you age you want less and less risk. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" SHARING OR STEALING
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,6,"Josh (Ben Stiller) is a semi-successful documentary film maker. He is married to Cornelia (Naomi Watts) whose dad (Charles Grodin) was a successful documentary film maker. Josh has problems sharing. Cornelia has problems having children. Their friends all have babies as our 40-some couple face the reality of their life. In pops Jamie (Adam Driver) and Darby (Amanda Seyfried) a young unorthodox couple who captures the hearts and mind of our aging couple. He also aspires to be a film maker and invites Josh to help him out.The film spends the first hour weaving a tale and presenting us with flawed but likeable characters. Then of course the ""twist"" comes in at about an hour (typical for all films). At this point the film which had me hooked, loses me. It was a twist I felt coming, but couldn't believe how poorly it was done as compared to the rest of the film. The characters were too out of character.The feature had some feel good moments, but didn't excel as a comedy. May work as a date night rental.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" A perfectly 'so-so' film (i.e., a perfect documentary)
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,9,"This is a comedy of manners exploring the difference between youth and age. An older couple with unfulfilled ambitions for family and career meet a younger couple who initially seem to embody a way to recapture a lost sense of potential for them. The older pair tends to think of the younger generation as having recaptured their own 'lost youth', and they see them enjoying things like vinyl records and VHS tapes that they had themselves tossed away for iPhones and mp3s. However, on second inspection it turns out that the 'integrity' of youth is really just seen by virtue of the aging couple's nostalgia. As the true facts of the situation start to emerge, and the young characters come to be seen as manipulative, cynical careerists, they are somewhat shaken from their pedestals. Yet, this film is not that easy. Although many see this as a comedy aping Woody Allen's style, in the sense that it presents characters who ultimately are not easily understood, this film is far more Cassavetes than Woody Allen. The older couple are certainly not saints, and their final decision of seeming to retreat from trying to seem young and adopt a Haitian baby itself seems somewhat impetuous (and 'young') and comes from nowhere. Are they really settling into their 40s, or are they doing something very hip? Many of the film's viewers have complained about this ending seeming to come from nowhere. I will not make that complaint, even though the ending is somewhat arbitrary. But I see that arbitrariness as something pointing to the director's real goal, which is not to resolve this situation but rather to show that it is troubling because the couple's motivations are by no means clear. The last words of the couple are indicative: they say youth is 'evil' and yet are themselves about to bring more youth into the world. Is that not at least a partial contradiction? I think this is a question that the director actually wants to be uncomfortable for the audience, and it is with reason that many people have pointed out the inconsistencies of this ending. It is a so-so ending.But what is good about this film is that it is perfectly 'so-so'. By that I mean that it doesn't have a point: it just follows two couples through some decisions that they make without offering a dogma or even much in the way of a resolution. This is the 'so-so quality' - that there is not a message being preached so much as there is a camera present in these people's lives (literally as they are documentary makers), and it registers what they are doing without bias. In a sense this film is the true documentary that is sought for but not found by the characters within the film. As a documentary, it shows what 'is' and does not try to arrange the facts to fit a preconceived plan for an outcome. Sometimes the figures in this 'documentary' make good decisions, other times we see them at their worst. There is no good guy or bad guy, and there is ultimately no point. It takes considerable maturity and reticence on the part of a director to refrain from making judgments and simply show without telling.In other hands, this film could have been more ideological, either choosing to satirize hipsters or to sentimentalize the joys of aging. But neither of those outcomes happens here. Instead the film shows some aspects of reality that are sweet (it is possible for old dogs to learn new tricks) and others that are grim (people can be moved by selfish and sometimes anti-social impulses). There is no character in the film who is either a good example or a bad example: all of them are people, which means they are complex, sometimes contradict themselves, and contain a variety of impulses (some of which are character-driven whereas others arise just from situations in which they find themselves). It is hard for a film to observe without editorializing - a director is constantly making decisions about what will be framed versus what not. Yet, in this film, we come about as close as possible to showing what 'is' without getting doctrinaire."
" Self collapsing, no closure.
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,4,This movie provides no closure. I don't mean it in the sense where they intentionally keep things open for you to interpret. The movie just collapsed under it's own premise. Stiller's impeccable though.
" Tight, Smart Comedy
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,10,"Intelligent comedy about a ""lost"" middle-aged couple trying to find ""meaning"" by connecting with a younger couple. But there's much more to this movie especially when we come across a storyline concerning what is fake or real in the media. The comedy is great too (""I didn't mean 'bless you' in the sneeze sense. In the Pope sense!"") Both leads are wonderful and I'm not usually a Ben Stiller fan. In under 90 mins, the writer/director has made a tight movie that is smart and has real feeling. Only quibble? Overuse of the Baroque on the soundtrack but there's also Bowie, Lionel Richie, Paul McCartney & Wings, and lots of hip-hop! (viewed 4/17)"
" passable
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,5,"Little film somewhat comedic. I think they were off with the characters, quite a bit was forced. It was like caricaturing. Not all that bad in itself. I give it a pass. The young is not more cheating than the old, it's a personality trait."
" Mid-Life Crisis
",2018-02-13 00:00:00,8,"I am cautiously biased about hipsters. Biased in the sense that many of them are self-absorbed and over-idealistic. But, I must admit, I've had memorable, life-changing experiences with kind-spirited hipsters. The kind like Jamie and Darby. I've known them, I've met them. In high school, in college and in the workplace. Those that welcome you into their lives selflessly and show you what it means to live freely and enjoy all the different eccentricities of life.While We're Young is a film that is just as complimentary and critical about hipsters. Josh and Cornelia are sent on an enchanting journey. Through street beaches and homemade ice-cream pints, they find what it means to truly loosen up and try new things. That is until they find that they've been set so loose that Jamie is trying to get one over on them. I wouldn't call Jamie a villain and I'm not sure if Noah Baumbach would either. He is a complicated companion as one would be if you were to really let a total stranger into your heart as Josh does. Likely, they will do things that disappoint you. But While We're Young ponders much more about our own quality of life. Baumbach is searching for that rare balance between freedom and rigid order and showing us how it can be found.Needless to say, as laid back as this film is, it's deep and fascinating in all the right ways. I found myself on the verge of adoring everything about While We're Young."
" sucks

" Not Baumbach's best, but absolutely worth your time
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,7,"For the first half of this film, I thought it was pretty typical Baumbach: a collection of amusing moments and characters that occasionally stumbled into plot. But it became something more. It became a reflection (on aging, on perspective, on authenticity), but - more importantly - it became a story."
" Good idea but disappointing result
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,5,"The basic idea of the picture could have been interesting if properly developed. The idea of setting the boring lives of a couple in their forties against the smart younger couple was intriguing at the beginning, but boringly conducted and ended with a big question mark. The dichotomy between old and young is not that simple and when the movie seems to exploit this idea, it suddenly takes a tumble and looks for an easier and reconciling finale. There's certainly good acting, Ben Stiller proves a good serious performer, confirming that talented comic actors can do a very good job in more serious roles, but lacks some due chemistry with Naomi Watts. The final result is rather disappointing: given its premises, the picture should have been more focused and much more daring."
