" Looks good, less filling
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,6,"It's great to look at -- so look at it; for visual presentation, it's among the best. Lovely. Unforgettable, really.For the story -- well, movies don't have to tell stories, and this one largely doesn't. Oh, there are pieces of stories: moments finely interwoven. Then another scene starts and -- well, it just starts, is all. Never mind the last character, we're on to something else.I understood beforehand that these were three stories made into a movie, so I was prepared for that challenge. But this film seems a little foggy on what it wants to say, and the effort made to tie the stories together doesn't actually help. When we see that the lover from the first story is the husband in the second story (believe me, telling you this is no spoiler; it's simply face recognition), this adds nothing but distraction -- because marital fidelity isn't even brushed on. The end conclusion is only that the saved an actor salary by having one actor play two unrelated (but prominent) roles.As I said, movies don't have to tell stories. But if you give us a long long take of an actor driving (to pick one example), something should happen after 60 seconds that didn't happen in the first 30. If we see their car go off the road, there should be either a reason or some consequence. This movie isn't interested in those details. Which isn't unique to Reichardt. I'm reminded a bit of Ozu's films, which often opened with a train, and skipped events that drive other filmmaker's stories (e.g., the climactic wedding in Floating Weeds is completely off-camera, as if cut out for time).In the Criterion interview, Reichardt objects to the perception of this being a ""women's movie"" ... then doesn't explain how it is not. It's not because it focuses on women; Steel Magnolias did that too. It's because it focuses quite sharply on women suffering in women-specific ways, and shows no understanding of the few men involved. Which some might consider fair balance for the men-dominated film industry, and the many, many movies which don't understand women. If that's balance, then we may expect many many more movies like this: incapable of understanding men, detailed about dysfunctional suffering, devoid of solutions -- but sympathetic to the women who choose those men, plow on despite their own suffering, and ache for something else they don't know how to find. If that isn't a ""women's film"" -- what is?"
" An excellent film if you want to get to sleep
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,3,"I saw this because i like First Cow, but Certain Women seems there is no point. Everything is so slow and exhausted. Everyone is bored in this movie.Even the animals are bored in this movie."
" Really enjoyed it
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,7,"I liked this movie, despite it being extremely slow moving and not really following any sort of traditional plot. The movie wasn't intended to do that, after all. It was more of a snapshot into life in a pretty harsh environment, and one that makes me glad I live where I do, despite the beauty of the landscapes captured.At times I found this movie blackly amusing (the hostage scene, the little doggy chasing after the buggy, the teachers asking irrelevant questions of the lawyer), and at other times it was desperately sad and a little depressing (that small town life just isn't for me).Overall I would recommend it, but not if you're only into action or psychological thrillers or slasher flicks - it's just not that kinda movie."
" A calm movie
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,7,"This movie is very simple with his element, not a big plot but just a four different women showing who they are , it was really nice it's have a good cinematoghraphy and very good performances for Kristen Stewart ,Laura dern , Michelle Williams and Lily Gladstone I just love this kind of movies and I think it's very underrated"
" Found! A Movie Impossible to Spoil!
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,5,"There are a couple of fascinating things I find with Kelly Reichardt's near still-born, minimalist feature, Certain Women.With a meta-critic rating of 82% and a Rotten Tomatoes score of a whopping 91%, I still can't work out for the life of me, what the professional critics see remarkable in this otherwise non-event of an anthology film. It can't be the non-dazzling, very orthodox direction. It can't be the drama-lite screenplay full of unremarkable dialogue and an unprovocative storyline. It can't be the stirring musical soundtrack, as there is only the very odd musical interlude. Technically Certain Women gets a non - flashy pass. The Montana locations are very pleasing on the eye. The acting is certainly competent, though the cast are hardly challenged by the types of roles on offer. In fact, rather ironically, the actor who stood out foremost to me, was Jared Harris, playing lawyer, Laura Dern's luckless, lonely, persistant, (but indisputably, male) client. The near universal acclaim for this very run of the mill Indi feature, I find quite baffling.On a more whimsical note, I have to pose the rhetorical question, ""Is this a film that's just about impossible to spoil?"" The reason being that simply nothing of consequence in the 3 stories, that hardly could be claimed to intersect at any point, really happens. Laura Dern's lawyer deals reluctantly with a long term aggrieved client. Twice a week Kristen Stewart's lawyer, (who possibly works at the same firm) has to also reluctantly teach a night school class, bizarrely 4 hours drive away from where she lives in Livingstone ... and then show up fresh as a daisy for her regular gig the next day. She also has to deal awkwardly with an obvious crush from a Native American girl, who we frequently see working an out of town ranch. Shades of a general exhibition gender reversed Brokeback Mountain! Michelle William's Gina, who we understand kind of wears the pants in her ""tenthold"", wants to negotiate with her elderly neighbour, with a view to excavating the sandstone on his block, so her and her husband can self - build their dream Montana home.I really don't think it would have detracted from the stories to add a little more exposition, at the expense perhaps of eliminating parts of the more repetitive ""action"" (people driving in cars and staring out windows, horses being fed etc). I think it wouldn't have hurt to have found out why Kristen Stewart had to teach that night school class, under such ridiculous circumstances, when she plainly didn't want to do it. Similarly why did Jamie, the rancher girl, become all star-struck with someone who obviously wasn't the slightest bit interested in her? (Jamie wasn't even asked about what she did till their second meeting.)Finally I'm left to ponder how Kelly Reichardt manages to keep making movies that apparently are hard pressed to break even, let alone make a profit. She must have a cabal of extremely understanding and generous producers she can call on. I had the misfortune of seeing her Meek's Cutoff a few years back. It would have the distinction of being one of the worst westerns I've ever seen. Certain Women, I have to admit, is better than that stinker and I feel I'm being really generous in awarding it a score of 5/10."
" Worst movie EVER
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,1,The only redeeming quality to this movie was the headlining actresses but then again they hardly had any lines or material to act on .
" If you want to watch a movie with very little going on, search no more
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,5,"I don't know how some films get produced. This has so much filler. I'm obviously missing something seeing as how the movie was acclaimed. When I saw the cast list, I thought I was in for a treat."
" cured my insomnia
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,1,"Put me to sleep, worst movie ive seen about nuthin"
" Dear Metacritic
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,7,"For foreign amateur reviewers on metacritic who complain that Hollywood never strays far from explosions and car chases, this is a reminder you can always find American art-school drama. It's a character study about women, obviously, three short stories that just barely and arbitrarily intersect. (Our favorite one about men is ""Saint Jack"" (1978) with Ben Gazzara in Singapore, which was shot in secret to avoid Singapore's nanny-state censors.) Some homegrown amateurs on metacritic complain that nothing ""happened."" Kids, write this down: there was a lot happening in emotional depth and light feminist themes in the backdrop of a vast, lonely, Montana vista that was a treat in itself. Not everything needs to follow a linear narrative with dramatic spikes or tropes. In any case, it's great to see Laura Dern in low gear after her manic performance in A-List TV (""Enlightened"") as well as Jared Harris from ""Mad Men."""
" What a waste
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,4,"How do you spell b-o-r-i-n-g. Did Michelle Williams owe this director a favor? She was the reason I watched this movie. It would've been better following just one of these women's stories with a little more added to it. I didn't see the connection, at all, of these women. I was stunned at the end, thinking, ""this can't be the end."" I don't recommend this movie at all."
" Enter the RCU (Reichardt Cinematic Universe)
",2019-11-07 00:00:00,9,"I turned on the most recent Kelly Reichardt joint on a whim, late at night, way past my bedtime. And I don't regret a thing. This is far and away the veteran filmmaker's best work. Of the previous films of hers that I've seen, I recall feeling lukewarm about 'Old Joy', but much more connected to 'Wendy and Lucy'. With that I film, I felt like I understood the subtleness and could live inside of it for 80 minutes or three hours or forever. What struck me about 'Certain Women', whilst firmly in the same vein stylistically, was how deep it felt in spite of perhaps because of its triptych nature. Working loosely in the anthology mode (as this film is essentially three connected shorts starring Laura Dern, Michelle Williams, Kristen Stewart and Lily Gladstone, and adapted from stories by the author Maile Meloy), these are the most complex characters to date in the Montanian Reichardtverse. They are strong, vulnerable, earnest and flawed, sometimes all at once. A true under-the-radar gem, one that makes me want to seek out or rewatch everything else in her canon."
" Terrific cast wasted
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,5,Terrific cast wasted. It follows the lIves of ordinary people walking through their lives (centred around the perspectives of 4 female protagonists). Lots of non-verbal moments. Lots of nothing going on but longing for what is missing (both in the film and in the audience). Big sky country filmed beautifully. I give this film a 5 (meh) out of 10. {Unembroidered Slice of Life}
" Well that went absolutely nowhere.
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,2,"To quote Steve Martin's character Neal Page in planes, trains and automobiles...
""You know... you know when you're telling these little stories? Here's a good idea: have a point. It makes it so much more interesting for the listener! ""Sums this movie up for me."
" Certain actresses? Yes! This movie? No!
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,2,"Laura Dern, Michelle Williams, Kristen Stewart? Wow, what could go wrong? All I can say is that I never even got to the part with Stewart because I bailed. Boring, indulgent, pointless. Don't bother."
" quiet little gem of a movie
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,9,"A carefully crafted and subtle indie film about three separate women living in rural Montana faced with loneliness and dissatisfaction in their lives. Two with men who who will never appreciate them. All three women of tremendous strength who find a way to keep on trudging through a brutal existence. Reinforced by the stark background of a cold Montana winter.
Superb acting. Quiet brilliance from the director."
" Newcomer Lily Gladstone steals the show from her A-list castmates in this indie trilogy
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,9,"If you're okay with a movie that doesn't have a conventional ""story arc"" or a tidy resolution--and it seems like a lot of folks here are *not* okay with that--then I strongly recommend this one. For us, the combo of Kelly Reichardt's terse visual style and Maile Meloy's subtle, affecting stories of Montana life was irresistible.The first two episodes flit by pretty quickly, like pages from an indie sketchbook, and don't have all that much impact, tbh: A small-town lawyer (Laura Dern) has to intercede when a difficult client (Jared Harris) tries to take the law into his own hands; a couple (Michelle Williams, a Reichardt standby, and James Le Gros) pay a call on a neighbor (Rene Auberjonois) who has a heap of sandstone on his property they covet for the house they're building.In the third, and most substantial episode, a shy ranch girl (Lily Gladstone) wanders into an adult ed class ""because I saw people goin' in"" and imprints on the teacher (an unglamorous Kristen Stewart). A fragile, asymmetrical friendship develops: the teacher mainly wants somebody to complain to about her four-hour commute; the rancher, who has only a string of horses and a yappy corgi for company, is clearly hungry for human contact.Lily Gladstone's amazingly expressive performance steals the show from her A-list castmates. Not much is said, and very little happens, but this final episode leaves you with a very strong feeling--almost more like a real-life experience than a movie--of the loneliness and isolation of this beautiful, empty country. Available on Netflix."
" Sometimes you need a movie like this just to feel normal...
",2018-10-26 00:00:00,7,"This is not a movie with a big connection or a twist of some sorts. Personally I was watching it for Kristen Stewart and she appeared briefly in the movie. Nevertheless, I felt satisfied with this film. Nothing over the top, I had a free evening and decided to watch something relaxing without over the top production costs or visual quality. Just a story about simple people trying to live their everyday lives. Sometimes you need a movie like this just to feel normal..."
" Quiet, Spare, Real
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,8,"I guess you either love it or hate it... I liked it very much. I especially loved the third story of the lonely rancher, Jamie (played beautifully by Lily Gladstone), who takes a chance to connect with someone she meets by chance. The glorious and lonely Montana landscape is the perfect backdrop for this film. I will remember it."
" Boring boring boring ,

" Boring
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,9,One of the worst wastes of film i have ever seen. Boring waste of my time.
" Beautiful story
",2018-09-07 00:00:00,9,All these bad reviews are just horrible...this is just a simple beautifully acted movie especially the last act Lily Gladstone was breathtaking didn't have to say much the her motion was all over her face this is the first movie I have watched by Kelly Reichert and I will be watching more.... obviously just my opinion by no means am I a Critic well for that matter an extremely intelligent person I do enjoy simple well acted well written movie
" Okay, I Get it
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,8,I watched this film once and thought it was interesting but what just happened? Then I watched again and saw something else. I saw ordinary people doing ordinary things in an ordinary way. Third time through I saw my own life with all the internal challenges I face and how I just go on living without complaining or coming to some devastating conclusion just moving on to the next scene.As a wanabe filmmaker I saw incredible actors who are capable of incredible drama and action doing the most understated roles brilliantly. Ordinary life is sometimes boring and slow with little reward at the end. Love is so often unrequited and good deeds so often unrewarded but that's life. I liked this film.
" BORING
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,2,So boring. I never write reviews but I felt compelled to warn others not to waste their time.
" A complete waste of my time.
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,1,"I watched this on Netflix the other day. Based upon the actors in the cast, I thought it would be an interesting movie. I'm not even sure why I continued to watch it except that I thought it might eventually make some sense and the three stories might merge together. Neither of those things happened and at the end I was just angry with myself that I watched the entire movie. There was no cohesive plot and no actual end to any of the three stories. Don't waste your time."
" Tripe...
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,1,"This was the most uninteresting movie ever made. Weird, disjointed dialogue and three unconnected stories about what? Seriously - who pitched this movie? Who wrote this crap? Who agreed to write checks for this drivel? Contracts were written ON PURPOSE to MAKE this claptrap."
" Read the viewer reviews first
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,1,"Unfortunately, learning that I should have read the reviews first is the most positive thing I have to say about this film. The cast attracted me; the story lost me. Take away: Montana is cold and boring."
" What the heck is the plot?
",2018-07-22 00:00:00,1,"This movie's meaning totally escaped us. There appears to be 3 somehow related ""plots"", but none are decipherable much less the overall meaning the writers were trying to convey. We both dozed at various points, the wife in fact snoozed the last 20 minutes ... we'll, she didn't actually miss much. The acting was okay, except for the super long, drug-out scenes of a lone actor just staring, or endless facial shots of someone driving. What possible life-changing enlightenment is one supposed to derive from that is beyond me, but today's directors and editors seem to think they are adroitly hitting us with ploys as ingenious as Hitchcock or Ford. Not."
" Hmmmm...
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,2,"Not really sure what the writer/director is trying to say in this. Honestly, nothing really happened, and I felt weird about that. Only good part was the mountains."
" I saw a Netflix movie w Laura Dern - I figured it would be good - HA...
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,1,"But Oh Nooooooo
I saw one review where something was said about dullness - wow - I am all about artsy and cool flicks but this was just plain a waste of my time - I kept waiting for SOMETHING and was just happy when it was finally over. What a waste of my time. Ugh"
" Big Waste of Time
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,1,"When I first saw the cast I thought it might be good, wow was I sadly mistaken. Boring and totally none eventful."
" Time I'll Never Get Back
",2018-06-18 00:00:00,1,"Boring does not begin to cover this movie! My husband and I thought it looked interesting so we were sucked in. I kept waiting, waiting and waiting for it to all fit together but it just ended leaving us looking at each other with blank stares!Awful, just plain boring awful. Wish I had done something constructive instead of watching this total waste of time!It was just a lot of scenery, driving in trucks, watching animals being fed with very little dialog. The only actor/character with any character at all is Jared Harris. I can't believe he agreed to be in this pitiful excuse for a movie."
" Terribly boring stories
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,5,"Independant women like this are a dime a dozen in Canada, especially in the french community. Dependant women are rare! Check french canadian films. So this film was quickly boring after the first segment with Laura Dern. I gave it one more star because the acting was quality."
" a microcosmic film-making in its most auteurist stature
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,8,"Carving out a sublimely low-key triptych out of Maile Meloy's stories onto the screen, Kelly Reichardt's lucidly orchestrated CERTAIN WOMEN whisks her audience to a small-town Montana, and in each part of the triptych, a woman finds herself flummoxed by a common-or-garden quagmire about human interaction (by turns, professionally, domestically and emotionally) which soberly flouts any sensationalism through Reichardt's brilliant execution. Laura Wells (a pensive and discomfited Dern), a middle-aged lawyer, is frustrated by the persistent visits of her client William Fuller (Harris, strives for an ostensibly expansive persona but strikingly betrays his disquiet bobbing right underneath the surface), who insists on suing his company for the work-place injury inflicted on him, even after Laura repeatedly explicates to him that it is legally nugatory reckoning with his circumstance, still he won't take her advise seriously, not until he implicates her into a late-night hostage foolery, the episode finds an almost anticlimactic pay-off. The heroine in the second segment is Gina (Williams, exquisitely smoldering in her understated flair), who is married to Ryan Lewis (Le Gros), and they have a teenage daughter Guthrie (Rodier), their marital rift starts to aggravate when they visit an elderly friend Albert (Auberjonois) to buy a heap of sandstone lined up haphazardly in front of the latter's house, which they can use to build their own abode. If Laura's plight is occasioned by exterior intrusion and social prejudice (people tend to believe an authoritative male figure than a female one), Gina's story tackles a more internal frustration within a nuclear family, stranded inside a loveless marriage (right out of the box, Reichardt notifies us Ryan is Laura's part-time lover), Gina seems to have an upper hand over a biddable Ryan and in negotiating with Albert for their house's sake, but Reichardt's observant camera brings home to audience that she is also invidiously victimized or undermined by the male parties here, not to mention being given the short shrift from the pubescent Guthrie. A scathing but tonally placid critique about motherhood, wifehood and being a strong woman allocates the second chapter ample elbow room (for both Gina and spectators) to breathe and introspect.Yet, a crescendo is crystallized in the third story, about a young girl, simply credited as the Rancher (Gladstone), whose Indian descent is only hinted, takes a horse-tending job on her ownsome, seeks any ghost of human contact out of her monotonous solitude, she stumbles on a night class of school law taught by a young lawyer Beth Travis (Stewart), who has to inure a four-hour drive (one way) for this biweekly endeavor. An unilateral attraction germinates in hugger-mugger, so how far does one can go to venture a possible reciprocation? Most of the time, the answer is always there, clear as day, but no one can blame you for trying, the newcomer Gladstone kills it in her transcendent reaction shots in response of a bewildering nonevent, brimful of subtlety and unfeigned undertow of heart-breaking, meanwhile Stewart brings about a significant mien of jaded weariness and guarded spontaneity as a wrong-footed, short-changed bottom feeder. 
 
Opting for a less elaborately interwoven structure, Reichardt allows each story flourish on its own terms without much fragmentation, and only tentatively suggests the characters' tie-ins (Laura and Gina is obliquely linked by Ryan, the Rancher and Laura has a fleeting encounter in her office, that is all), and most extraordinarily furnishes these heartfelt female-centered stories with an incisive contemporary spin meanwhile upholds her aesthetic integrity to the hilt, CERTAIN WOMEN is a microcosmic film-making in its most auteurist stature."
" Not sure what I just watched
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,1,"What a sleeper of a movie. The characters weren't even interesting. However, I kept watching because it has great reviews, so I was sure there was going to be some climax and/or crazy way the characters lives ""intersected"" (as the summary described). I truly don't even know what to say about this movie except I'm a bit ticked and I want my 2 hours back.

" Poor User Review are Off-Target
",2018-03-03 00:00:00,8,"It is galling to read some of the negative reviews of this film as it suggests that many reviewers are not appreciating the film for what it is and that is a film about three short stories about the relationships of four women set against a bleak if not magnificent back-drop of a rural America. The film is superbly acted and subtle and has no need for contrivances and special effects that appear to dominate many of our films nowadays. It can't be accused of not telling a story, it can't be accused of poor acting and it can't be accused of poor direction. So it is hard to fathom why there are so many negative reviews. If a viewer wants an action film then of course they will be dissapointed but this is not the point of the film it is to show how everyday events often boring and take place in mundane environments but to being able to capture this is the surely is the essence of good film making."
" A good and unique indie film
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,7,"In rural / small-town Montana, three stories interact: a lawyer (Laura Dern) seems unable to set boundaries with an ex-client (Jared Harris) who is unhinged and deranged; a rather uptight woman (Michelle Williams) tries to find motivation in building a new home even though her husband and teenage daughter are growing more and more distant from her; a young rancher (Lily Gladstone) is infatuated with a recent law graduate (Kristen Stewart) who arrives in her town twice a week to teach an educational law night class.""Certain Women"" is written and directed by Kelly Reichardt and based on short stories by Maile Meloy. Like other Reichardt films (her best is ""Meek's Cutoff"" (2010)), this one tells so much in the unspoken word - where a silent reply says so much more than a bluntly worded statement. She is blessed with a superb cast who can make the viewer feel so much with a camera lingering on their faces.It's tempting to think ""nothing is happening"" at the beginning of each segment. But once viewers catch on to Reinhardt's unique style, they can see that a lot is actually happening. The Gladstone/Stewart story stands out for various reasons and not just the great acting (Gladstone rightly won many awards for her performance). It provides a great re-telling of the tragic story of someone having a crush on another who aspires to be (or already is) in a higher class in the socioeconomic hierarchy.Their story, like the others, have a theme of loneliness and isolation even for those who are surrounded by people. This film has a special and unique charm that is quite rewarding."
" Only a movie critic could love this pointless boring failure.
",2018-01-13 00:00:00,1,"Boring pointless nonsense. No plot. Unpleasant characters about which we know nothing and so care nothing about, doing nothing interesting, in unpleasant uninteresting surroundings for no discernable reasons. Who cares? One of the worst movies we ever tried to watch. And, don't bother trying to turn up the brightness on your TV, the dismal cinematography is as dim as the characters portrayed. Gave it up after 45 minutes. Using your time instead to clean the trash cans will be more entertaining. Some critics say this movie is great because it shows ""real"" people, like all of us. We go to the movies to avoid people like us. If you listen to anything a movie ""critic"" says (like we did), you/we deserve a turkey like this."
" What the heck was that???
",2017-12-17 00:00:00,1,"One of the most pointless movies I have ever witnessed! There was NO ending whatsoever. I am pretty sure the title SHOULD have been, ""Boring Women""! The characters never really intersected, the entire movie was pointless! If you EVER get a chance to see this movie--DON'T! Run away! Far, Far Away! The review asks if the review contains any spoilers--how can you spoil an absolutely pointless movie?"
" Low Budget Low Energy
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,3,"Don't be fooled by all the exaggerated hype about this film. It's all a bunch of b.s. The actors were low energy, with no emotions to speak of. The story line is non-existent. It's boring and drags on and on and nothing ever happens. And I don't get this ridiculous description - 3 women's lives intersect - because they never do. None of them have to do with one another and it's all leading nowhere. The best actor in the whole film was the girl playing the farm hand - she was REAL. The others were blah, with not one interesting or redeeming quality. I feel bad for anyone who actually bought a ticket to this farce."
" A Dreay Excersize in Political Correctness
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,1,"This ""film"" checks all the boxes. I Saw this listed in the TV guide, Laura Dern, Michelle Williams, I'm in!Two hours later, I'm scratching my head. Was there a point? Other than just vague suppositions about 'feminism'? Its three stories very loosely combined into one. The Laura Dern story was at least interesting. The Michelle Williams story was utterly confusing, I'm still not sure what it was about. She was buying old rocks from an old man who didn't want to sell them? The Kristen Stewart part was absurd. She was being stalked by some lonely lesbian who followed her across Montana. If it were a white male doing the stalking, there would be restraining orders and perhaps prison. But, because it was a Native American lesbian, we're meant to see it as beautiful and a celebration of diversity, blah blah blah.This wasn't just a bad, tedious film, I'm actually worse off for having sat through it.Is the decade of the 2010s just a low ebb in art and cinema? Or is this the new norm, where PC/ diversity/identity politics destroy the artistic process. I hope its the former, for the sake of Western Civilization."
" What is this film about?
",2017-12-08 00:00:00,2,If you want to watch a movie about nothing...watch this! This movie wasn't even beautiful. You would think they could have found some beautiful scenery at least. I kept watching because with all the good actors I figured SOMETHING was going to happen.....but NO. Please go watch a faucet drip before you watch this movie.
" A slow drama that fails to fully engage
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,5,"It doesn't seem as though indie darling Kelly Reichardt will be changing her directing tact anytime soon.Becoming well known for her intimate, slow-moving and character driven character studies (that more often than not star Michelle Williams), Reichardt's film aren't for everyone but there is often a quiet power to Reichardt's stories that can't be denied.Hitting a peak with lost dog drama Wendy and Lucy and losing her way with the sleep inducing female driven western Meek's Cutoff, Certain Women is middle of the road Reichardt that see's the Florida born filmmaker examine the lives of 3 separate women in the American state of Montana, each going through their own various journey's in this great big world.There's barely an ounce of character development or backstory as we're thrust into these women's everyday lives, from Laura Dern's lawyer Laura dealings with Jared Harris's potentially dangerous client Fuller, Michelle William's hardworking mother and wife Gina and Lily Gladstone's The Rancher's strange fondness for Kristin Stewart's class instructor Elizabeth and while these women's stories are intriguing to a sense, there's never a good enough set-up or reward to truly make this intertwining story truly memorable.As per usual with a Reichardt film, Certain Women looks great in a quietly poetic way and the acting is universally good, without ever delivering any big character moments or situations for Reichardt's cast to shine at their brightest levels but it's hard to fully invest yourself into a film that feels rather emotionally cold and a problem that sometimes manifests itself in such narrative structures, some of Certain Women's most interesting plot points seem to end as we're thrust back into another characters life, making us feel as though we're being a little ripped off by a story that had more to give us.Final Say – Reichardt's ponderous and deliberately paced drama will be a treat for her small yet passionate fan base while for the rest of us, Certain Women is a well-intentioned and finely acted drama that never hooks us into its world in a way that would've made it more readily accessible and easily recommendable.2 ½ short-legged farm dogs out of 5"
" slower with some interest
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,6,"These are three tangentially connected stories. Laura Wells (Laura Dern) is a lawyer struggling to explain to her client Fuller (Jared Harris) his unwinnable case for the last eight months. One meeting with a male lawyer and he accepts it. He's angry and he goes off. Gina (Michelle Williams), Ryan Lewis (James Le Gros), and their teen daughter are living in the woods as they build their house from the ground up. The couple tries to buy sandstone from their neighbor Albert (René Auberjonois). Ranch hand Jamie (Lily Gladstone) happens upon an adult night law class taught by lawyer Beth Travis (Kristen Stewart).There is a nice uncomfortable disturbing vibe coming from Jared Harris. That's why I don't understand why Laura would go to him. The cops may not care about a defense attorney but she should know better. It's hard to empathize with smart people doing stupid things. At least, the first story goes somewhere. The second story is not as compelling. I might be missing something but it's a misfire. The third story has an obvious end point and it becomes a matter of waiting for the climax. Feeding the animals is not cinematic enough to make the waiting compelling enough. The final meeting is pretty poignant although the actress needs to do some bigger acting at the appropriate moments. The first and third stories could be expanded into a more cohesive movie. There is a contemplative aspect to tying these stories together if only it could illuminate more the point."
" Time NOT well wasted
",2017-10-13 00:00:00,1,"The story is non existent. 1h47m could have been done in 20m with the same content. I'm only sad I cannot give a 0 star review. Which is sad as I recognized one of the actors and have enjoyed many films he was in.Please don't bother watching, you will most certainly regret wasting your time.I have nothing else to write about as there was nothing to write about at all. The description is vaguely accurate. During the whole movie we were waiting for the story to unfold, yet nothing happened. I have only heard of movies like this before as I tend to not watch any, but I thought it would have been a good movie for the two of us to watch. I am sorry I even saw the title."
" What A waste of time?!
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,1,"I hated myself for watching this movie! My wife hated me for making her watch this movie! I never felt this about any other movie in my whole life!!! There was absolutely nothing to see, no stories, no nothing! There was no message to deliver! No plot! Nothing! You will be much more entertained watching the news!"
" Didn't Quite Make It
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,5,"I enjoy a good arty film as much as anyone but Certain Women fell short. I started watching it with the expectation that it was about three women whose stories would inter-connect. I continued thinking this through at least the first half of the second story when we see that the lover of Laura Dern's character in the first story is the husband of Michelle Williams' character in the second. There was nothing more about this(!) nor any more connection between anyone. Oh wait, yes, the woman in the third story had a crush on Kristen Stewart's character, a lawyer, who worked in the same town as Laura Dern, though not even at the same law firm. So it was really about implied, not actual, connections. And, when something implied doesn't follow through, especially in a film, there's a feeling of let down.This was a film in which the setting or the landscape was a fourth character, perhaps even the most intriguing one. The landscape played a large role in creating whatever emotion arose in me as a result of watching this film. The drawn out shots of the characters' faces, such as Michelle W. looking out the car window, or the ranch hand sweeping the stable,or the pile of sandstone, was overdone. Perhaps if more had actually happened between the characters those long quiet moments would have been not only tolerable but effective. But drawing blanks on both accounts just didn't work. In a way watching this film was like looking at a painting for an hour and a half."
" A sober, minimal but intense portrait of women, expertly interpreted
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,8,"It's years since I saw a sober movie on women like this. Used to a cinematography where the female inner world often needs to be too much explicitly exhibited, with women moving from anxious neurotic creatures to incomprehensible beings, here we have a very delicate presentation of four women living in the wide and remote plains of Montana. The vastness of the landscape, fascinating and disquieting at the same time, is the ideal setting for the presentation of a vast, both still and restless inner female world, expertly rendered by the interpreters. Each of them did a great job, especially Lily Gladstone who does not speak more than a hundred words, but lives her character with rare intensity. As a woman, this is a picture I deeply appreciated: at last a movie showing off no excesses and no exhibited emphasis. When less is definitely more."
" Honest portrayal of real people
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,9,"As depicted in ""Wendy and Lucy"" (2008) and ""Meek's Cutoff"" (2010), Kelly Reichardt's characters are lost without a significant guidepost to hold on to, adrift in a society in which they struggle to fit in. Based on short stories from the 2009 collection ""Both Ways Is the Only Way I Want It"" by American writer Maile Meloy, Reichardt's latest feature, Certain Women, displays the struggle for connection of three women whose loneliness mirrors the economic and spiritual malaise gripping a part of 21st century America. Set in the rural West, the film features an impressive cast that includes Laura Dern, Michelle Williams, Kristen Stewart, and newcomer Lily Gladstone All are complex and resilient characters, yet individuals who resist any outward expression of their inner feelings. In the first section, Laura (Laura Dern, ""The Founder"") is a personal injury lawyer distracted by a mid-day affair with the married Ryan (James Le Gros, ""Point Break""). When Fuller (Jared Harris, ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E.""), an emotionally distraught client refuses to accept the fact that he has no cause of action against an employer for an injury suffered on the job, Laura must balance her innate feelings of empathy with her fears that he may become violent. When he takes a night watchman hostage, the police turn to Laura to confront him, an acknowledgment of her personal strength. In this segment, the open spaces of the West so beautifully depicted in ""Meek's Cutoff"" are transformed into the spiritually empty local mall with its Starbucks and chain stores, seemingly mocked by a contingent of Native Americans dancing for the customers. In the second story, Gina Lewis (Michelle Williams, ""Manchester by the Sea"") is in an unhappy relationship with husband Ryan (Le Gros), who appeared in the opening segment as Laura's secret lover. As they plan on building a home in the area, the family's emotional state is reflected in the attitude of her teenage daughter Guthrie (Sara Rodier), who makes little effort to hide her resentment towards her parents, causing her dad to implore her to be nice to her mother. In their visit to Albert, an elderly neighbor (Rene Auberjonois, ""This is Happening"") husband and wife attempt to convince the old man to sell them a pile of sandstone that has been in the front of his house for years, property to which he has an emotional attachment. Marital strain is evident in the conversation in which Gina takes the lead, however, but the focus is on her needs rather than Albert's feelings and when Gina waves to him from her car when she is leaving, he simply stares blankly at her through his window. In the longest and most powerful of the three stories, lawyer Beth Travis (Kristen Stewart, ""Personal Shopper"") has to drive four hours each way to teach an evening class on Education Law. One of the attendees, Jamie (Lily Gladstone, ""Subterranea"") is a lonely rancher who shows up each week to the class even though she is not registered. Apparently physically attracted to the instructor, they meet after each class at the local diner, but the conversation about Beth's awful drive to and from work is less important than the poignant expressions on Jamie's face, looks that longingly search for clues that her attachment to Beth might be mutual.Though not overtly sexual, their ride on Jamie's horse back to her car is as subtle and as lovely an erotic expression as I've seen on film and Gladstone's rich and heartfelt performance deserves to be remembered at Oscar time. Like other Reichardt's films, Certain Women moves very slowly without the aid of any background music to cue our emotions and can be challenging for those uncomfortable without thrill-a-minute action. Viewers who appreciate grounded stories about resilient and intelligent characters, however, will be moved by the film's honest portrayal of real people. It is one of Reichardt's best."
" No dream is altogether a dream.
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,7,"Kelly Reichardt continues assiduous to give us images and pictures from the old country. In the near future she will have her own festival of films of a lesser following. This is a film that does not take into account its market or industry, nor does it have a plan for how and where it will reach its potential audience. Thats rare and well-worth to appreciate. Kelly Reichardt has a knack for picking the right people to put in front of the camera and embed in these environments. She also has a strong sense for the importance of the underlying importance of the words and gestures. Quite unusual in movies from the USA. ""Certain Women"" opens with a scene inspired by the ""Psycho"". And goes on to offer more interesting film references. With that pleasant concise low energy. A sight for sore eyes. No dream is altogether a dream."
" a fine character study
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,9,It's a very good film regarding character development I feel. I must say in my defense I've not too deliberate tastes--an offered emotion really lights my interest--doesn't need to be much.I do want to focus upon though upon the rancher girl.Has anyone here considered the fact she cannot read? Give that some thought.
" A tedious and pointless film, quite literally, about NOTHING....
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,1,"I was massively relieved when this film finally ended, after having endured the director's apparent reluctance to edit out any parts of long pointless film sequences of snow melting (or not melting), horses being fed, people saying little or nothing at all and then having no real end to speak of. If this was intended to be a film about three very uninteresting women with boring lives then it succeeds. To be avoided....."
" A director with confidence and maturity getting better film by film.
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,8,"I have seen all of Kelly Reichardt's films since Old Joy and loved them all - for their simplicity, honesty, quietness, patience, truth, etc etc. The placement of fully believable people wrapped in their time and landscape, interacting with other human beings is fascinating to me! I could watch it for hours. Anyone who comes to these films expecting a more conventional narrative, or a fast paced edit will leave disappointed, but I equally believe to call any of her films, especially this one, boring is to show a deep immaturity, which says more about how you interact with film than anything critically worthwhile as commentary to a bone fide cinema artist.All the performances here are sublime. So rich and detailed and real. It must be a thrill for an actor to work with Reichardt, so rarely do they get to come this close to truth in creating characters. Dern, Williams , and Stewart impressed equally, but Lily Gladstone, who was previously unknown to me, was mesmerising. Such a beautiful performance. Watching her face in silence as she drives home, experiencing a thousand emotions, will be a moment in film I long remember and talk about! So amazing to have a director that has the patience and confidence to show that.Nothing happens in this film but life. For me that's enough. An infinite tapestry of detail is all there in Certain Woman, you just have to want to see it."
" Interesting
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,7,"I have to admit I haven't seen an indie movie for a while. It was an interesting movie, though not one that deserves 5/5 as some reviews I've seen stated. The reviews focus on ""independent"" women is misplaced. More than independent they are disconnected. The stories are almost stills on how disconnected they are. The first is a lawyer who cannot connect with her client tragedy; the second is a woman who wants to build a house but cannot connect neither with her husband and daughter nor with her neighbour (she cannot even connect with the stones in her neighbour garden which she covets for her house); the third story is about a law teacher who cannot connect with one of her students, a young woman living an isolated life taking care of the horses on the family ranch with her dog. The latter would be perhaps the most connected of all if she didn't live in the middle of nowhere.For now 7/10."
" What a gorgeous little film
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,9,"On the face of it, not a great deal appears to happen in this film. But scratch under the surface ever so slightly, and there is a great deal of real life going on.People have also said that these are three disjointed stories - they are anything but. All three supply massive sub context to one another. The fling we see the lawyer having in the first vignette informs the second story, and our protagonist's increasingly futile search for an individual in the third piece gives us so much of an insight into the lives of others in the whole piece. Three different stories - but the three are inextricably linked.Add in some stellar performances from a very strong cast, tremendously beautiful and in equal parts brutal cinematography, and a Director who masterfully leads us through the narrative, and you have an utterly compelling (if superficially unspectacular) and stimulating little masterpiece to enjoy."
" Rough bunch of meanings
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,4,"This movie is worse than ""Night Moves"". Both were made by the same director - Kelly Reichardt. I'm a fan of ""Night Moves"" - this one was a big surprise for me. Both movies have some similarities - intelligent, slow-paced, focused on something behind the scenes so you have to decode this coded meaning. However there's a big difference between these two: ""Certain Women"" simply doesn't work as ""Night Moves"" does. Three key stories of women didn't catch my attention so I felt myself like I was watching some rough material work for some reason. Movie simply doesn't provide any clues. Is this about feminism? Is this about twists of women's fate? Is this about lesbian love? No answer. I like slow-paced movies of this sort but this one is simply boring movie delivered as a rough bunch of meanings that I can't decode."
" Teenagers could have made a better film
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,1,"If you think the trailer is cryptic and ""i need to see that movie to see what it's all about"", don't. Really. Do. Not.I just saw the movie in the theatre and it's exactly like the trailer. No story, no music, no real message and no link between the lives of these four women except that each of them is supremely boring. At the end of it, most people were laughing like me, kind of stung, baffled, at the lack of action at the beginning, the middle and even the end. For the LGBT community, nothing interesting to see there either.Save your money and go see something else."
" Great movie with complexities
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,8,"I was expecting a silly group of women, cooing about nonsense in Montana. Instead I was delightfully surprised to find 3 well crafted stories with interesting characters who soaked up the screen.This movie provided a peaceful sadness to the viewer. Beautifully portrayed by the talented main actresses. Not a single redeeming male moment to speak of, other than the dad (who turns out to be a cheater) asking the daughter to be nice to her mother. A very pro women movie to be certain but for the stories it told, things made sense and never felt preachy. Just a sad display of humanity that left you routing for the main actresses to stay hopeful."
" An uneven triptych
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"Kelly Reichardt is one of those director/writers who has made it their focus to film, the unfilmable, ordinary people in their downtime simply reacting or not reacting to things. This is all well and good, and each piece of Certain Women works beautifully on their own, but as a collection pulled together it feels random and unfocused and not in a good way. The three stories of Certain Women are all set in and around the same small town in Montana and are also loosely connected (a few side characters show up in different segments which are more of a distraction than a convincing narrative thread). The women of the three stories are Laura (Laura Dern) a personal injury lawyer dealing with a disabled and embittered client who won't accept that he signed away his rights, Gina (Reichardt's muse Michelle Williams, working with her fort the third time) an uptight woman trying to get the material needed for her dream home, and Jamie (newcomer Lily Gladstone, amazing), a lonely rancher who unexpectedly falls for a lawyer she meets in the strangest of circumstances. The stories are all very undramatic and subtle but in Reichardt's hands the material absolutely sings. There is a lot of depth and nuance to these characters and it is wonderful to watch them. Unfortunately she does not afford equal time to all the characters and this has the effect of making her film feel lopsided. The best segment in the film is the one with Gladstone's rancher, and I sincerely wish that Reichardt had worked out a way to pad it out with 40 more minutes of material because at 50 minutes it is the longest segment by far and it is the most interesting and the most poignant."
