" What ever Pixar movie wants to be but never will
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,10,"Outstanding story telling amazing visuals and cinematography with an incredibly plot that manages to pull your heartstrings without being soppy or overly melodramatic.This is what every Pixar movies aspire to be but never will, since it has heavy subject matter genuine comedy and a clear vision from part of the filmmakers of the instead of a 2 years release schedule slot from a multimillionaire company dominating child entertainment today.This is one of the best stop-motion animated films of all time along with Anomalisa, Mary and Max and The The Adventures of Mark Twain (and chicken run)."
" Pretty good!
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,8,"It's beautiful and totally Loveable movie, great storyline... Suitable for kids as well as adults. Kind and smooth going movie. Watch it without any hesitation."
" Red Nose, dark circles and winter sunshine.
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,7,"This kind of form full of antique atmosphere, childlike interest and material touch is more suitable for giving charcoal to sadness and loneliness than adding to happiness."
" Very good!
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,7,I guess it's now a tradition to rob French animated movies at Oscars...
" Excellent and heartbreaking story
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,8,"This film has a very tragic feel combined with a very colourful and childlike feel. This doesn't sound like it should work, but the director's masterful talent combined with compelling animation and voice acting bring this vision to life in a coherent way. We follow these very broken children as they come to terms in an emotional tale."
" Very good
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,8,"This is a heartfelt, touching little movie about childhood and stuff. I liked it a good bit."
" Quietly heartbreaking, but funny and charming
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,10,"Beautifully rendered, dealing with tough topics in a very thoughtful and accessible way. The characters of all the children are beautifully drawn and the film has a very warm heart and is funny and charming, as well as being quietly heartbreaking. Quite special and I'd urge everyone to give it a watch."
" Such a beautiful movie i have watched
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,9,Animation is creativity and the story is inspiring and I love this kind of graphics. I enjoyed every moment of it and music is creativity and audio feed to ears . I wish it was longer than one hour because I do not feel that I am full of it. I loved it with all my heart
" ""Even if...""
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,10,"Turns out, the filmmaker behind Portrait of a Lady on Fire once up on a time wrote the script for a totally delightful, unsentimental but truly heartwarming and at its core tough family animated movie that starts with a little boy accidentally killing his drunk louse of a mom and being sent to an orphanage... Where the message is, basically, if you can connect with others around you - even the presumptive bully (I mean he has red hair, after all) - you'll be alright in life.Adorably and impeccably crafted, warm, deeply felt, basically like finding a great kid's book that doesn't talk down for a second to kids (the mentions about sex seem just about right and work for amusing wonders for a French import, but notice how it treats abuse of different kids, it says enough without needing to say it all for what some of the kids have gone through), and the more I think about it the more good it makes me feel.I only wish I'd seen this sooner; I'd put it right there in what Truffaut and Malle did with child characters in their best films, and it may reach a wider audience if parents are smart enough to turn their kids on to it (or adults watch it themselves regardless)."
" Feels like seeing the world through a child's eyes
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,10,"The animation style of stop motion, slightly awkward character designs and color-coded characters gives the film an overall fanciful look. The direction very much focus on the small details and seemingly irrelevant details, i.e. birds building nest. Tiny odd details keep cropping up as either a story point or as a visual motif, i.e. beer cans. This fancifulness is at odds with the story's emotional core.The story is one of loss and gain. The loss of one's parents but the gain of new family. The loss of innocence but gaining wisdom. Or gaining a friend (from an enemy) only to lose said friend. The story is deceptively simply but a ton of humanity is packed in the little moments. On paper this story is quite dour with nary a moment of joy. What joy there is laced with sadness. You would think this would work against the animation.But it turns out that the combination of the two discordant elements utterly work together. This feels very much how one views the world as child. And the film is all the more emotional for it. This film realizes its central character's viewpoint utterly."
" Children were hungry for love and just dreamed of getting confidentional love.
",2019-08-31 00:00:00,7,"Children would definitely treasure whatever their parents gave to them. Even if it was a stupid nickname or an empty can, they would do because they cannot live by themselves.
It looks very sad because the story focused on children in an orphanage. But unique and colorful character designs made the dark atmosphere brighter. Their arms were weird long though.I was about to cry with their smiles in the roller coaster's scene. In these casual scenes, I was touched and hoped for their happiness.The script was proper for 66 minutes long! Additionaly, a bit of hopeful story was better than I expected. I don't want to see that innocent children are hurted.
'If I wet the bed and doodle, do you love me?'"
" Pretty Great Movie
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,8,"As an animation nerd, I was already won over by the ugly and creepy, yet charming stop motion. The style may be disturbing and disgusting to some, but I think it will grow on most. Basically, this story revolves around an orphan boy named Courgette and the relationship he develops. Despite what you may think, this movie is not for children. I'm not saying that it's too mature or adult, but I'm saying that this movie will most likely be appreciated only by adults or oddly pretentious children. This movie makes a difference in the film industry by enforcing the idea that animation is not limited by children's media, yet it is not trying to be overly adult. In my mind, it's a great movie, and it may be to you too."
" Short and sweet
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,9,A beautiful stop-motion animated film. It has an almost effortless charm to it in a good way which is a huge credit to the makers behind this who I must also praise for tackling a variety of difficult situations that some children unfortunately find themselves caught up in. What's most impressive though is its ability to tell a great and emotive story that many movies with a far longer running time often fail to convey.
" Animation that Doesn't Hide Behind the Label ""Kid's Movie""
",2019-05-29 00:00:00,7,"""My Life As a Zucchini"" is a movie that resists any effort I undertake to categorize it alongside other films. It's animation is top notch along side films like ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" but it is no way the adventure that Kubo is. It's a dark film, but not like ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" or ""Coraline."" It's a movie for kid but not like ""Coco"" or ""Moana.""
I want to say that it is a great kid's stop motion film, but I'm afraid people would be surprised by how serious the film is, but I also don't want to give the impression that it is too serious for kids. It isn't.What is unique about this film is that it seems to be genuinely from a child's perspective. I don't just mean that the protagonist is a kid. There are lots of movies which have child protagonists but they don't necessarily read as from a child's perspective.Take ""Coco"" or ""Moana"" for instance. These are films which feature a child doing incredible things, but the kids don't act like kids and they don't think like children. Their sense of logic and understanding is similar to an adults. The adults in the films never try to hide life's harder side from them, don't really talk down to them, and one gets the feeling that either one would be pretty self sufficient if push came to shove."
" Beautiful Animated Story
",2019-05-15 00:00:00,10,"This is not a film for kids, so don't let that turn you off. Older kids may enjoy it, but this is, first and foremost, a film for adults. It is heartfelt and magical. It is one of the best animated films I have seen in a very long time. It's great to watch either in the English dub or its original French.It starts out great and just gets better from there, all the way up until the very end. You may even cry. And at just over an hour it's not a minute too long and it will leave you wanting more, which I think is a good thing. This might just be the very best animated film I have ever seen. It is certainly one of the very best films of 2016. Highly recommend."
" Tender, funny and affecting insight in to the world of fostering children
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,8,"It's been said more than a few times that we are in a golden age of animation. These sort of claims are hard to assess when we're in the middle of the time being talked about - we lack perspective; and animation isn't a medium I pay a huge amount of attention to for the simple reason that the most talked about animated films tend not to get released very widely (or at all) in South Africa).Streaming services are making it easier, though, and finally catching up with 2016's My Life As A Zucchini/Courgette (delete according to your location) was a joy. It's a short (65 minutes) Swiss stop-motion animation about an orphaned boy (who calls himself Courgette), sent to a home for foster children. The film (I watched an English language version - with an excellent voice cast - though I understand subtitled original language versions are available) tells the story of how building relationships with other orphans and adults, how they listen to each other's stories of trauma and learn to grow in trust.It would have been easy to go in one of two directions with this story: the one being a twee, saccharine affair that would be ill-fitting the serious subject matter; the other unbearably sad. That the film is neither is remarkable. The animation provides a sense of otherness that allows us to enter into the experience of the children with our defences down; the decision to portray them with wide, expressive eyes redolent of the human impulse to project on to children the innocence we wish we still had as adults.As a foster parent myself, I know full well the desire to fix the problems of the children in my care; and how those around me seem to think that foster children have no different problems to 'normal' children - and that somehow 'just' loving them will be enough to bring healing. This far from the truth - you can't just fix a human being, and no amount of love is going to undo trauma in the formative years of a person's life. The film knows this, and wisely portrays the other traumatised children as the best people to bear the burdens with a traumatised child. It's not that there isn't a role for parent or therapist or teacher, of course - it's simply that only a child who has been there can truly enter in to the pain of a child with these experiences.The film is full of deeply moving little details - the child who runs outside shouting 'Mummy?' every time a car pulls up; the way children in these situations can end up feeling like pieces moved around a board they can't see the whole of; very realistically, the children here are shown as repeatedly and forcefully trying to assert their own agency.There's a danger in the film's ending of the implication that once the children find a reconstituted family situation of some sort, that all will be well. To conclude that would not be in keeping with what had gone before; but the implication could have been more clearly avoided. Otherwise this is a tender, funny, beautiful film that avoids clichéd tear-jerking to tell a story that is truthful and repeated all over the world every day. As a charming and striking viewing in its own right, or as an insight in to the world of fostering children, this is well worth seeking out."
" should have won the oscar!
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,9,"One of the best animated films I've seen in a long time
I don't know how to describe the feelings this movie emits
Sad mad happy
A mess I guess is the best way I can express how I fee"
" A heart for orphans
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,9,"I watched this move with my daughters. At first I thought it would be a movie that wouldn't attract them to the end, but we held on and were mesmerized by the heart with every moment.
This movie taught my daughters about some of the ugliness and heartache of the world, but it also taught them to be resilient and to stand for the good no matter the situation. My only complaint is the duration of the movie, I could've watched an hour more. I loved it to the end."
" Wow!
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,8,"My Life as a Courgette. Got a limited cinema release which was a shame but - Wow. I don't normally like animated films, but this is a must watch. A young boy, who prefers to be called Courgette has endured unthinkable problems at home and is taken to a children's home where he meets other kids who have, for one reason or another, had to leave their family home. And they have to grow to accept their new life and their new 'family'. If Ken Loach did an animated film this would be it. I was unashamedly in tears. Mark Kermode called it not only his film of the year but one of his films of the decade. A 61 minute running time masterpiece. Need to see it again but on first watch I'd give it a stunningly emotional 8.5 out of ten"
" A touching movie about being an orphan.
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,9,"Don't be fooled by the somewhat silly title and the odd designs of the characters, because this movie brings up heavy subjects which is greatly welcomed in times of dumb and pandering animated movies. In general, My Life As A Zucchini does many great things besides bringing subjects of alcoholism, child neglect and adoption to animation while still being fun but not hyper active. Thank you for that! The characters are so real you can't help but feel their pain when they are sad and their happiness when that kicks in. I also lived at an orphanage when I was younger, and even though I was there for other reasons than these characters I couldn't help being awe-struck by the realism. I loved every minute of it, but I must confess that I think the overall design of the movie will alienate a potential older audience who may get the idea that it is a silly movie. But no wonder it got an Academy Award nomination!"
" Heart warming movie
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,9,"Since this film was nominated for the Academy Award, I've been wanted to check it out. I finally watched it on Amazon yesterday, and now I know why this movie was chosen to be nominated.This film depicts children's emotions so well. 
Every one of us experience our childhood, but not many of us remember exactly how we felt like when we were kids. Thus, sometimes ""grown-up adults"" forget how to treat children right. This film definitely reminds those people how children are not just children, but they have each individual souls. 
It was indeed really heart warming movie."
" My Life as a Courgette
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,5,"I remember seeing images and clips for this Swiss-French cartoon during its cinema release on film review programmes, it was rated average by critics, but I know it got attention during Awards Season, so I was hoping for something worth my time. Basically Icare, who prefers to be called ""Courgette"" (or ""Zucchini"" in America) (Erick Abbate), lives with his mother (Susanne Blakeslee), who has become a violent alcoholic, due to Icare's father abandoning the family. In a drunken rage, his mother comes after him, as she comes up to the attic, he slams the door on her head, accidentally causing her to fall down the stairs to her death. Courgette is taken in by Police Officer Raymond (Nick Offerman), he keeps one of his mother's cans and a kite he made with a drawing of his father as a superhero as mementos. Raymond brings Courgette to an orphanage, there he is initially picked on by Simon (Romy Beckman), one of the kids, who tries to force him to say what happened to his parents. One day Courgette and Simon fight over the kite, after which Simon warms to him, he explains that he knows about the backgrounds of all the children in the orphanage. Simon tells the backstories of all the other kids, whose parents are either deceased or, in his own case, in trouble with the law, Courgette then tells him what happened to his own mother. One day, new girl Camille (Ness Krell) arrives at the orphanage, on first fight of her Courgette develops a crush. Simon and Courgette sneak into the office to see Camille's files, they find out that she witnessed her father murder her mother for cheating on him, and then killed himself. Camille does have a living relaive, her Aunt Ida (Amy Sedaris), but she is a spiteful woman who only wants custody of Camille for the money she will get. Whilst on a class outing to a snow resort, Courgette and Camille start to bond, he refashions his mother's beer can into a toy boat for her. Courgette grows close to Officer Raymond as he regularly sends letters and drawings to him. Raymond plans to spend a holiday with Courgette, on the same weekend that Camille is supposed to spend with her aunt, but Camille instead stows away in Raymond's car. Raymond reluctantly agrees to bring both kids to the outing, the three of them enjoy themselves at an amusement park. They return to Raymond's house, where Raymond reveals that he has a son that never talks to him. Aunt Ida suddenly appears and angrily takes Camille away. A few weeks later there is a custody meeting for a judge to determine if Aunt Ida will take Camille in. There, Camille plays an MP3 recording of her aunt's voice, where she insulted her mother and yelled at her, Aunt Ida loses her temper right in front of the judge, destroying her bid for custody. Raymond finally decides to take both Courgette and Camille in as foster children. Simon is initially angry, but he ultimately accepts that a reluctant Courgette should go with Raymond. Before leaving with Courgette and Camille, Raymond takes some group photos of the kids outside of the orphanage. While living with Raymond, Courgette continues to write letters to the kids at the orphanage, maintain that he, Camille and Raymond still love them all. Courgette now keeps a group photo of the kids on his kite. Also starring Will Forte as Mr. Paul, Ellen Page as Rosy, Susanne Blakeslee as Ms. Paterson. At first glance, you'd assume this is a brightly coloured children's film, in reality it is something of a sad one, it has a heartfelt approach dealing with difficult subjects, such as loss and abuse. The character designs are bold and unusual (Courgette being blue-haired with a red nose), and the characters themselves are well-thought out, especially the children who are impressively authentic, talking like real kids would about certain subjects, it is an odd length, being just over an hour, but it doesn't need to be any longer, an interesting alternative stop-motion animated drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Worth watching!"
" Lovely movie!
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,9,"It's so cute,I didn't get bored of anything about this film.I have watched it with kids and we had beautiful time."
" friendship in the unpleasant circumstances
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,10,"One of the many reminders that animation doesn't have to be ""cute"" is Claude Barras's Academy Award-nominated ""Ma vie de Courgette"" (""My Life as a Zucchini"" in English). The subject is a boy sent to an orphanage after his mother dies. After some initial trouble adjusting, he befriends a girl, and then starts developing good relations with the other children. But there are more challenges to arise.The stop-motion animation allows for all sorts of perceptive facial expressions, especially as we learn the backgrounds of the children. This is the sort of movie of which I would like to see more. Certainly more interesting than many of the animated features that we see."
" One word lovely
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,8,"Movie night with Gertie.Oscar-nominated stop-motion animation, as poignant and well observed a film about the darker side of childhood as you could ever hope to see. Touching on bereavement and bullying, but does so in a way that is humorous and ultimately life-affirming.Courgette has big, marvellously expressive eyes. You quickly forget that you're watching puppets. There are plenty of laughs, especially the ill-informed sex education. And it has Ron Swanson for god' sake.This is a film that should appeal both to adults and to older children. This is a sensitive and very nuanced account of orphan children. One word lovely."
" my honest unfiltered thoughts

It's a welcome change in pace from the flambouyant action, flat charcter trophes, meaningless slap-stick dialogue, and massive, world-changing narrative archs that make up the majority of animated films. There is plenty of comedy, but it never detracts from/contradicts the scenes mood or distracts from the ongoing story. The focused and contemplative quietness of this film and the intense attention to the nuanced emotions its characters experience build both starkly sad and tenderly uplifiting moments with out betraying reality. It is only 66 minutes long and makes full use of every second. Also the ending credits song is fire - Le Vent nous portera, covery by Sophie Hunger. The (French) voice actors, particularly Gaspard Schlatter and Sixtine Murat who play the two main leads Courgette and Camille did an excellent job of bring to life a child's perspective. I haven't watched the English dubbed version, but I've heard it doesn't measure up to the orginal voice acting in French, so I'd reccomend watching the French version if you can.One review called ""My Life as a Zucchini"" undercooked? Its main complaint was that the ""emotional heft of the film is unexpected and the problems some of characters face are nothing that a child should have to deal with"" and they ""don't know who'd I recommend this film to"". While their observation that the cast of characters face disproportionately heavy problems despite their young age is true, it doesn't detract from the overall movie because the film's target audience was not necissarily elementary age children even though its main characters are. In fact, I don't think this movie is well suited to a very young audience (I think some parts are proabably too mature for kids under 12/13-ish). I think the main aim of the movie was not to provide high-energy entertainment aimed at children, but to explore the emotional complexities the characters face as result of their situation. These themes are presented in layered and often nuanced ways that only an adult/adolescent would be likely to pick up on or find interesting. Another criticism of My Life as a Zucchini is that its story, which starts as a tragic orphanage situation is too cliche. While this criticism is fair in that the story does have a cliche set up, the way in which the characters navigate and cope with their situation and their emotional complexities is thoroughly explored, well executed, and ultimately very heartfelt."

" My Life As A Courgette is a delicate mature drama disguised as a child-friendly animation.
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Sure, children can watch this and be entertained by the cutesy animation. Just do not, I repeat, do not go into this thinking it has no substance. The first five minutes happen and I immediately said ""well...we're going there are we?"". Hit me like a tonne of bricks falling on my face. Essentially we follow a group of young children in a foster home as they create close bonds between them and learn to mature into adulthood. A coming-of-age drama at its most subtle, and it is with this subtlety that elevates this into a melancholic intimate experience. Child abuse, neglect, loneliness, sorrow and love. All these themes are explored through the perspective of children, and it is rather sad to watch. Witnessing these characters come to terms with their past was inspiring. No matter what obstacles life throws in your way, you can always move onwards and upwards. An outstandingly meaty narrative despite the tiny runtime of just 67 minutes. However it's not all doom and gloom. This feature will evoke happiness and bring a loving smile to your face by the end. Like I said, the subtle manner in which it addresses important issues like child abuse is what gives this film life. The colourful stop-motion animation (which I absolutely adored) and bountiful subplots are just ripples in what is a sensitive puddle. The balance between melodrama, family friendliness and humour was perfect, couldn't fault it. The small idiosyncrasies to each character gave them more personality, which I admired. I personally would've liked a longer runtime so we could see these characters interact more. Some more internal conflicts and backstory would've definitely enhanced the emotional investment. Though these are slight criticisms to what is a beautifully crafted animated story that more people definitely need to watch. Support these small films! Cinema needs them. It's just another reason why French cinema keeps on improving..."
" Simple, Beautiful
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,8,"I randomly stumbled across this movie while surfing Netflix, and I'm so glad I watched it!First off, the plot is quite simple. It's essentially about a young orphaned boy, Courgette (Zucchini), who finds love and friendship during his time at an orphanage. Having watched many films with complex plots, I found the simplicity of ""My Life as a Courgette"" to be very refreshing. In terms of the characters, I found all of them to be very believable/realistic. Additionally, I was able to empathize with every character (except for the evil ones, haha). In this regard, I must give a lot of credit to the voice actors as they brought so much life and emotion to these characters!I also want to add that the animation is relatively low-key, which I believe actually enhances the simplistic nature of this film. I must, however, warn you that the animation is a bit choppy. I personally didn't mind this, but it may not be everyone's cup of tea. Overall, this movie is short and sweet. With a runtime of only 66 minutes, it's great to watch if you're not in the mood for a long movie. Many important themes - such as child abuse and love - are explored, and the movie does a beautiful job following a young boy's journey. I highly recommend you give this movie a try!"
" Honest, To an Uncomfortable Degree
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,7,"One of the most tender and sweet-hearted movies of 2017, and some of the greatest stop-motion animation I've ever seen. Sure, its heart doesn't always feel earned, as some characters switch on a dime just to suit the story. Still, this is a beautiful and devastating look at the insane world foster-care kids are forced into, with the natural naivete of a child being forced into incredibly grown-up decisions. Fix some of the clunk character psychology, and this would be an all-timer."
" Undercooked Zucchini
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,6,"I don't know, maybe I'm not the target audience of this film. The reason why I watch this is because I am interested with the art in it and I think it was refreshing to watch this kind of animation in a world full Pixar. Also, the fact that it is an awards contender made me more interested in this film.But story wise, I think that it didn't got me there. I thought it was predictable and I thought it was okay. Maybe I am just expecting too much on a movie made for kids? or is this just the effect of watching too much Pixar (in terms of story)?"
" There's meat in this zucchini
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,8,"Odd as it may sound, films with vegetables in their titles often turn me off; I heard of My Life as a Courgette (more commonly called a zucchini where I live in Canada) and saw Netflix marked it for ages 8-10, but had some time to kill and it was only 67 minutes on, so gave it a shot. Well, Netflix was a bit off on the 8-10. Adults will find a lot to admire in this little zucchini.Like this year's It by Andy Muschietti (yes, I will make the insane comparison), it is refreshing to see films are still being made where kids still talk like real kids; they're under 18 but they talk about sex (or draw a nude picture as we see here), whereas most modern Puritanical Hollywood movies will treat that as heresy. My Life as a Courgette also confronts the roughest subject matter fearlessly, and manages to pull at the heartstrings in the process. It may seem too easy to do that with a story about orphans, two getting adopted at the end, but it takes something special to make it feel unique- a great deal of maturity and thought went into crafting the emotions and getting them out in a genuine way. (Moonrise Kingdom also ended with adoption-by-cop following an orphan in love- its merits were also strong, though different). The animation goes with stop motion over the now-expected computer 3D, and also develops its own winning charm."
" Somber Claymation
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)For being stop-action, clay animation, it was a very realistic-focused film. Nothing wildly creative or imaginative. The film starts off with a boy nicknamed Zucchini, whose mother is an abusive drunk. An incident occurs and he is sent to live in an orphanage. Much of the film consists of him finding his place with the other kids and his interactions with the house's bully and a new arrival kid. I think the director felt that with how real the characters and their situations are that it would be very relatable to many and an interesting perspective to relate to clay characters. It was a fun, colorful and honest look at life through clay."
" An emotionally mature and charming little story beautifully told in stop-motion form.
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,8,"'My Life As A Courgette' is an emotionally mature and charming little stop-motion picture that tells its positive and uplifting small-scale story in a breezy 67- minutes without wasting a single beautiful frame. It's refreshing to see a piece of family entertainment that deals with some pretty heavy themes and tackles them fairly head on without ever letting them weigh it down. It's this that sets it apart from the others in the genre, as it allows the picture to feel truly genuine and for it be truly touching, too. Ultimately, the piece works so well because it provides a proper connection to the central children, with whom we both laugh and cry. 8/10"
" Bold, colourful, charming and heartfelt
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,8,"'My Life as a Courgette' was the last of the five 2016/7 Best Animated Feature Oscar nominees viewed by me, and that it is (to me) the weakest of the nominees and still manages to be a very good film is testament to how great the other four films ('The Red Turtle', 'Kubo', 'Moana' and the winner 'Zootropolis', so very stiff competition) were.There is not a whole lot wrong with 'My Life as a Courgette'. At just over an hour it is a little too short and it did have a story that was deserving of a longer length, and the depiction of orphanages (usually a dark and unhappy environment that people can't wait to leave) is rather rose-tinted. Otherwise, it is a beautifully done film that has much more to it than the quirky if silly title, the cute-looking characters and bright colourful visuals make out. Not classing these attributes as bad things in any way, but it is so easy hearing and seeing it advertised to get the wrong idea about 'My Life as a Courgette', thinking it will be a quirky film with children as its primary target audience, bright colours and witty humour when actually there is much to the film than that.It is a beautifully animated film certainly. It is very vibrantly bright and colourful, with parts of truly haunting atmosphere, a vividly immersive world and meticulously detailed backgrounds and overall visuals from the little things to the bigger effects. Just as good are the eye-catching character designs that are modelled smoothly and even with the oddball looks look and behave very authentically, for characters they are very unique and charmingly unusual (what other title character has blue hair and a red nose?).Furthermore, the music score is appropriately atmospheric and whimsical, while the writing has quirks and poignancy. The story could have benefited from a longer length but still charms, amuses and moves, with a surprisingly sober tone, while not being afraid to take risks and brave more difficult subjects with sensitivity and never heavy-handedness. This is including one of the boldest opening sequences in any animated film (perhaps the boldest since that for Disney's 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame'). Everything is paced beautifully too.Characters are very easy to warm to and have engaging, distinct personalities. Voice acting in both the American and particularly French versions is very emotive.On the whole, beautiful film and has much more to it than one would think. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
" touching characters
",2017-09-28 00:00:00,8,"Icare or as he prefers, Zucchini, lives with his drunken single mother. He accidentally kills his mom and is sent to a children's home. Police officer Raymond befriends him. Simon bullies him but becomes a good friend. New girl Camille arrives and he falls for her. This is an European stop-motion animated film. It has an unusual intriguing look. The character designs have a beautiful ugliness. My only drawback is its shorter running time. There is something odd about this inbetween length and leaves me missing something. I do like Simon's turn especially. Initially, he is a full-on bully but he turns into one of the most compelling character in the movie. The story has some real heart. This is an Oscar nominated animation."
" A charming debut
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,6,"Stop motion that's not from the stables of Laika or Aardman, it's apparently possible. 'Ma Vie de Courgette' is a stop motion and claymation animation film by relative newcomer Claude Barras. Who works his ass off to impress you.In just 66 minutes you are bombarded by an array of intense themes and imagery: emerging sexuality, the longing for parental love, the mourning process, innocence and youth. And... it takes place in an orphanage, of course. In that respect, it is more akin to a Japanese anime than to the average 'Chicken Run'. Intense, especially considering the target audience of this little film. Fortunately, there is enough room for laughter, something that makes it all feel more real and at the same time more easier to digest.The plot - a young boy called Courgette (but not really) enters an orphanage and falls in love, gets bullied, makes friends, etc. - is serviceable but cannot cope with the amount of themes and life lessons with which it is juggling. The short runtime forces the otherwise interesting story into a confused mismatch of moments without much cohesion nor natural progression. For once, there is a simple but true explanation for its shortcomings: the budget. Which is about 10 times lower than contemporary stop motion movie 'Kubo and the Two Strings'. A shame.Give 'Ma Vie de Courgette' some more room to breathe and it could have become a cult classic. Now it feels as if it were a rather successful Cartoon Network experiment. Nevertheless, this is not at all a bad movie. On the contrary, it's a bold debut movie chock full of charm from a man with clear potential. I look forward to his next project, although Iit will have to be something without those infinitely annoying Tim Burtonesque eyes.★★★"
" Mature take on youth that still keeps a child-like tone
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,10,"My Life as a Zucchini was nominated for Best Feature Film at the 89th Academy Awards. And for a 70 minute feature, that says a lot. This French-Swiss stop-motion animation film takes on a mature content but never fails to keep its child-like tone and to an extent, its innocence.It follows the story of Icare (but prefers to be called Zucchini), who lives with his alcoholic mother. After an accident, Zucchini has been sent to an orphanage by a policeman named Raymond. Zucchini's start at the orphanage is rough—thanks to the Simon, the bully. From there on, we are immersed into Zucchini's adventures as he learns of friendship, of family and of love.This animated film ravel with its wonderful visuals that reminds us of the days when its was toys over tablets. In a way, this serves as a nostalgic treat for teenagers. Almost every scene carries a powerful meaning. But its greatest feat is looking at the lives of these children through a different lens—they are all abandoned, damaged or broken. One has her mom deported, the other has his father jailed— these are all mature themes but nevertheless, real.But despite all that, Zucchini and his crew are all still children. They play, they dance, they sing. The film never stops to carry this child-like tone. The colorful aesthetics are impactful and an array of vibrancy spreads across the screen. It is a brave film that looks at life at an emotional depth. It's an eye-opening experience."
" Simplicity is just another form of art
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,9,"The way they made this film was very original, and good originality is very valuable and worth watching. I love stop-motion, in this is an excellent stop-motion, because of everything in the film impressed me. The characters are very original, even the name that the main character has is amazing. The screenplay embraces so many genuine topics, as love and the different ways it can be shown; it has humor but it also wants to make you cry and fall in love with each character. The production is incredible, amazing, out of this world; and I couldn't ask for more, it made me want to cry because of this simple but outstanding production! This motion picture is really worth watching, is very touching; and if I could only watch one movie for the rest of my life it will be this one."
" Beautifully designed animation with hope beyond dark themes
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,8,"When I was very young growing up in the UK, there was a children's show I watched called ""The Raggy Dolls"". Defective toys thrown into 'the reject's bin' of a toy factory came to life and had adventures. By depicting cast-outs and the marginalised finding solidarity and friendship the show aimed to represent and build empathy for children who, for whatever reason, didn't fit in.While watching the Oscar-nominated Swiss animation ""My Life as a Courgette"" I thought about ""The Raggy Dolls"" more than once and felt that the creators must have had similar aims here. The film tells the story of Courgette, a young boy who has been raised by an alcoholic single mum and now finds himself in an orphanage. The other children have faced an array of similar abuses and must find courage and hope from one another. A key strength of the film is the fine line it walks between depicting real darkness and maintaining a light enough tone for child viewers. There are hints that one of the children in the orphanage has been the victim of sexual abuse and writer Celine Sciamma deserves a lot of credit for portraying such a theme with the sensitivity it merits while maintaining a child-friendly rating.The film is an adaptation of a book by French author Gilles Paris which was largely intended for teenagers but here the focus seems to have been attracting an adult audience while leaving the experience suitable for the whole family. It certainly feels like the sort of film that parents will watch together with their children rather than leaving them in front of it. The design of the film is remarkable. The materials used, with clay for the character models but real cloth for their clothes, give the film a wonderful physicality and texture. Coupled with the small scale locations and cute designs such as the tiny wheels on all of the cars, the film has a toy-like feel which produces a protective, safe atmosphere to counter its dark subject matter.The characters are charmingly realised, with the children given the principle roles. Their actions are often heart-breaking. One girl, whose mother has been deported, runs to the door expectantly every time a car pulls up. The children all gaze longingly at a mother comforting her son after he has fallen from a sled. It definitely works - the film is emotionally affecting but genuinely hopeful.The film should be applauded for not tacking on a lengthy, unnecessary third act which ups the stakes and adds a conflict to be resolved - the orphanage is going to be bought by evil Mr. Grimshanks? We have to stop him children! Lots of movies would have done this to make the film more 'cinematic' but these are always the parts of the movie where the plot stops serving the characters and would have been sinfully out of place here. Having said that, the film does fall short of providing a Dardenne-esque breakthrough moment to bring our characters to a new state or realisation and the movie to even greater heights.This is the 3rd of the Oscar nominations for Best Animated Film in 2017 that I have seen, with ""The Red Turtle"" and ""Moana"" yet to be viewed. So far I think that the Academy definitely picked the worst of the bunch with ""Zootropolis"". At the time of writing ""My Life as a Courgette"" has 50x fewer ratings than Pixar's film on IMDb. This is a shame, as the Swiss film is a considerably more measured story and innovative film and deserves a wider audience."
" A tale of joy
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,8,"Great movie. Awesome. I thought this movie would be sad, but it's not sad. The only sad part is the beginning. The movie has a lot of heart without being tragic or sad. You just get to see the main character interact with the other characters and grow into a better life. The only flaw is the film has a rosy depiction of orphanages, when orphanages are not nice places in any way."
" Great entertainment and social commentary for both kids and adults
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,8,"An animated French film about a young boy nicknamed Courgette (French for Zucchini) who moves to an orphanage after his mother dies in an accident. From the poster you can see that the film is in claymation; at first, creepy, but becomes rather cute and beautiful when in motion. For a kid's film, it has quite a dark opening that would freak kids out even if they don't understand what's going on. I wasn't sure where it would go from there. The film turned out to be quite heartwarming and funny, cute and rather gentle. A great message on the relationship between parents and children and it's importance, that kids and adults can both get something out of. Sitting among kids and adults in the cinema, I had a great time."
" ""There's no one left to love us....""
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,9,"""My Life as a Zucchini"" was nominated for Best Animated Feature for the 2017 Academy Awards but lost to ""Zootopia"". It's a shame, as 2017 offered three very deserving films (I would also include ""Kubo"") and only one could take home the award. Perhaps my love for ""My Life as a Zucchini"" is influenced by my work as a social worker and therapist, as the story is a hopeful tale about children who have been shamefully abused by their parents...a common problem I had to deal with on the job.The story begins with a child stuck in the attic of a horrible home while his mother is downstairs getting drunk and violent. When she tries to enter the attic to beat the boy, he panics and slams down the trap door...and the mother falls to her death. Soon the child is being talked to be a very kind police officer, Raymond, and he's surprised to hear that the boy's mother just called him 'Zucchini' and that's the only name he knows. Fortunately for poor little Zucchini, the man is touched by this case and regularly visits him in the children's home where he is sent to live.As for the children's home, seven children reside in the place and they are given kindness and love. It's actually a pretty nice place, but your heart goes out to the children and the hell they've had to go through during their short lives. Most of the story is about Zucchini and how he adjusts to the place as well as his falling for a girl who arrives soon after him, Camille. And, fortunately, the picture, while VERY moving and sad, has a nice happy ending.This is a very, very special stop-motion film. While it's very artistic and well done it is something more...it's very sweet and has a depth to it you really don't expect in animation. The Swiss film is available in both the original French language version and an English dub (which is very good) on the same DVD. Perhaps other versions are also available, but on the DVD I saw these were the two language choices. Well worth seeing...but have a Kleenex or two handy just in case."
" A tender, affecting little film
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,8,"""My Life as a Courgette"" is such a simple story and simplicity really is the film's greatest strength. There is no flamboyant animation, no huge narrative arc, no gargantuan obstacles to somersault over, no chaotic chase sequences, no loud, yappy dialogue...basically nothing like what you might expect if this same story was told by an American studio.At 66 mins, it's short and to the point, quiet, contemplative and starkly sad, yet filled with uplifting moments of hope and tenderness, which it conveys without ever feeling contrived or overly- sentimental.The young French voice cast are terrific (I do hope anyone reading this review watches the French version and not the American dub). They do well to convey the vulnerability behind the broken characters. That, and I think some of the lines just sound so much better in French - the way the brattish Simon spits out the word ""potet"" was particularly amusing to me.The animation is rather basic and the character's faces are not hugely expressive, but enough emotion is conveyed through body posing, vocal performance and composition that you would need a heart of stone not to feel for the young gang of misfits.By the time the bitter-sweet end credits song kicked in, I was noticing a little moisture in the corner of my eye. Not sure the kids in the audience enjoyed it as much as I did though....which is an important point really. This film is NOT intended for young children. It deals with adult themes like death, neglect and abuse, in a very delicate way mind, but still, it's not something that's going to entertain the 'fidget spinner' generation."
" Wacky Claymation
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,5,My Life as Zucchini is a quirky story about kids in foster care that have a myriad of emotional problems. Somehow they form bonds and become a family. At times the emotional heft of the film is unexpected and the problems some of characters face are nothing that a child should have to deal with. I don't know who'd I recommend this to though..
" Fruitily good
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,8,"This review of My Life as a Courgette is spoiler free**** (4/5)BOYHOOD, INSIDE OUT, Coraline and Kubo and the Two Strings all these films have one thing in common and that is: they focus on watching life through the eyes or the mind of a child, learning the lessons of life, love, trust and emotion. All films with refined characterization, heartfelt stories and a light tone. Swiss Director Claude Barras notes down all this in his inertly sweet, charming and utterly compelling stop-motion animation My Life as a Courgette.Inspired by Gilles Paris' novel Autobiographie d'une Courgette the film focuses on the life of 9 year-old Icar (Schlatter) who prefers to call himself Courgette, a normal blue-haired boy who loves art and is a bit of a kleptomaniac. He is forced to move into a foster home with other children his age after the loss of his mother. Here he learns the true meaning of life, trust and true love, he's lonely as soon as he moves in he doesn't quite fit in with these other children. He gets bullied, laughed at and is effected by name calling his life goes in a downward spiral until he meets the love of his life with 10 year-old Camille (Murat), he immediately learns the lesson of true love. She is just like him, she lost both her parents and is forced to live with her cruel aunt, Courgette teaches her important lessons such as: friendship, trust and family. And it's wonderful.Other stop-motion animations such as Coraline and last year's Kubo and the Two Strings have this impact embedded within them, with their gorgeous animations, through heartfelt stories, and their incredible characters and My Life as a Courgette keeps this going from blueprint to screen. It's not perfect, there's a flaw - a party scene with these children enjoying the festivities which out stays its welcome, but thankfully due to Barras' direction it's not a huge flaw. Barras' tone to Courgette's life is exceptional he deftly carries his characters (that look like they were created in Aardman's workshop) with a similar story but the love that he gently adds progresses through Courgette's eyes. The refined characterization stunningly matches heartfelt drama, emotional heft and lovable memories all-in-one. At 70 minutes it whisks by really fast, but there is more drama, more emotion and more movement around the characters than any other drama twice its length - it grabs your heart from the get-go and refuses to let go even after the credits end. A stunning French stop-motion animation that's simple in its means to fly the kite of childhood, piecing together life by the chunks and wrapping it around difficult life situations, which will stay in your heart forever. VERDICT: My Life as a Courgette is a stunning French stop-motion animation, filled with joy, emotion and a lot of drama, which sweetly conveys deep thoughts and genuine sentiment."
" One of the best love and friendship stories out there
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,9,"If there was ever a way to tell a story of a 9 year old boy who mistakenly killed his mother and had to stay at a foster home with other children, who were either depressed or had autism/behavior problems, it is told in My life as a Zucchini.Now don't run away yet thinking it's a sad movie. That's not it at all. This is a movie that takes a very heavy hearted story and turns it into a light hearted tale through humor and joys of the youth. But nonetheless, I wouldn't recommend seeing this with the kids. There is a certain feeling that us as people sometimes get when a story sheds some light on the darkest parts of the universe and you can definitely expect that from this film. Love is it's own language and we first learn it, just like with most things, from our parents. This movie shows how love could be understood on its own if we are lucky, but it takes a lot more strength. If you think you've seen it all, you'll be surprised by this very short 66 minute film and I would recommend this to anyone who is wants to see a movie that challenges their hearts."
" L'amour inconditionnel
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,9,"What a felicitous oeuvre! Not the shiny kind of beauty, the other kind, the one that transcends.The story telling, the animation, the backgrounds, everything seems a bit minimalist but the intensity of this 60 minute movie I found was overwhelming.The central theme of the movie: unconditional love. In some scenes it becomes more explicit, in other less. But I discovered several expressions of it, all cunningly portrayed. Some gorgeous, some hide in the shadows before revealing themselves and others seem even darkly romantic. The most touching, that I will remember for some time to come; When Simon tells Courgette to take his chance - after all Simon just did to reunite the gang, wanting to have all is friends back together and as happy as possible. Sting sang; ""if you love somebody, set them free"" - here is what that might look like.Funny that this topic turns out so well, when the story revolves around kids. Food for though; about where pure love might come from and how adults need to cultivate it.This is a nice change among all the tit for tat stories and the Hollywood saga of the outsider rising to a hero that get rehashed time and time again. The voice acting by Nick Offerman was also deserves a special mention here."
" Very touching movie
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,6,I would say that this is very good movie .Nice animated dramatic movie to be accurate. I enjoyed it . But this movie is emotional. I mean you get listen horrible stories of children which they have encountered. And if you are a such a victim then this movie may make you remember those incidents to you. But don't worry all these are small part of movie and movie is not about horrible incidents. Instead the movie is kind of love story of two kids and how they get together with other orphan kids. Which is super awesome & cute and that's the good part. And the nice thing is the movie is short like an hour and has a good ending. I would also like to add that the background music is really good ; especially when the movie is finished.
" Seeking a second chance for the normal life.
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,7,"Whenever I review a Stop-motion animated film, I always start with by saying it is a dying art form that needs a bigger lift from us. It gave a new life for filmmaking when there were no technology like computers hundred years ago for the creation of giant creatures to all the fantasy and magical world. I am glad that every year someone coming forward to show the world how beautiful these are.I think there's a quota for it and 2D animation for the Oscars. Otherwise, these formats would die sooner than we expected, so that recognition in the big stage. Every year at least one film from these two categories makes out. This year it was a double jackpot for Stop-motion animation. Including this, 'Kubo and the Two Strings' was the other one to shine in the world's biggest film awards ceremony. But winning the trophy is almost impossible in this 3D animated film world. Anyway, I'm happy for this, that I enjoyed watching it.It was a short film, that ran for just one hour. First, we have to understand filmmaking in this form is a most challenging one than any other. It is a manual work. I mean people get in there and frame by frame do all the work. So for this one hour film, they had done the great hard work and it paid off well by got nominated for the Oscars. It was also Switzerland's official submission for the Best Foreign Language Film, but failed to make progress in that race.The screenplay was based on the book. A simple story with a strong message. This is the tale of a boy with full of dreams and after his alcoholic mother died, he is taken to the orphanage. That is the last place he wanted to be where he meets a mean boy and soon becomes his close friend. Being young kids, they tend to play some pranks with officials, visitors and themselves. That's one of the ways to cope with for where they have ended. So the remaining is to tell us would they get a second chance in their lives.❝I don't know why I'm crying. Sometimes people cry because they're happy.❞When some take up a project like this, they are not offered to make mistakes in choosing a weak screenplay. Because there are thousands of films in production around the world and in those, a handful of animated films, but probably he's only one up for a Stop-motion animated feature. Which means everyone with the knowledge of his commitment will be looking forward to it. So the filmmakers have opted to adapt a novel, which is always a best option in filmmaking.The next is the characters. Making them come alive, particularly initial stage, the creation of models. Yep, they have done that job as well so well. Gooding looking ones, especially among the kids for having similarity with their vision. The frame rate was good. Very smoother for viewing. So technically it was a flawless for the normal watch. An impressive storyline, which might serve as a tearjerker for a few.There's a little romance, but from the children's perspective of having a crush. Since the girl character was introduced, the narration takes a fresh look. The following event becomes even more adventurous and fun filled till the end. The voice-over was excellent. From the dialogues to the film scenes very impressive. It marks the directional debut for a short filmmaker. An appreciable work and I hope he makes more like them with new technics than migrating to computer animations.One of the advantages is it is a short and sweet film, but those who love such films might feel it is too short. Most importantly, there're not clichés like what we've seen films that takes place in the orphanages. The opening was shocking. If it was a real life, the boy would have ended in a different place. Still the emotional parts were less explored, yet very convincing for not leaning too much on that facet.The film is one of the best in its kind, but I agree it's not a masterpiece. Not if you have seen plenty of Stop-motion animations in your life. Yet it can't be neglected that easily and surely it is for everyone. I know there are folks who thinks this format of films are for little ones, but the truth is they are still in the pre 90s mindset. This is good, give it a try and you might love it. Anyway, for its rareness itself highly recommended, then you decided how do you liked it or not.7/10"

According to this French confessional, many if not most kids in Potato Fries Land do NOT have normal families. The title character, for instance, has a kite for a Daddy and an EMPTY beer can for mom. Even though it's a known fact that abortion and birth control run rampant in this Vino Nation, MY LIFE makes it clear that parents and legal guardians cannot wait to dump their children into back alley institutions UNLESS there's a ton of government handouts available to them in exchange for them rearing their own progeny. These latter day orphanages seem to be pretty dreary and depressing, because French History appears to be the ONLY subject of instruction, and everyone knows that's pretty much a montage of FOLLOWING THE PHILLIES AND CUBS: THE BAD YEARS. Young boys are forced to pick up their sex education from the gutters, along with--no doubt--the used condoms which they turn into ""water balloons"" in order to bombard law enforcement.

As the movie opens, we see the boy playing in his attic room, as his mom drinks beer after beer while watching TV. After an unfortunate incident during which the boy accidentally causes his mom to fall off of the attic stairs, the boy is taken away to a country-side orphanage, where he has trouble fitting in with the other 5 kids. Then some time later, a new kid enters the orphanage, a girl named Camille. At this point we are maybe 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is a stop-motion animated film. I admit not being familiar with Swiss director Claude Barras, but regardless, Barras here brings a tale (based on the book ""Autobiographie d'une Courgette"") that cuts close to the heart about the need for love and understanding. The boy, missing his father (whom he has painted on his kite) AND his alcoholic mother (it's not clear what became of her, other that ""she went away), is desperate for love and companionship as he makes his new life at the orphanage. The main characters are fully developed, with lost of nuance, and while there is quite a bit of humor in the film, the overall feeling is more bittersweet than anything. This movie is rated PG-13 for a reason and I would not recommend this for any kids younger than 9 or 10. BEWARE: the US theater release which I saw brings the movie in a dubbed version, sadly. It takes away from the charm of the movie, not to mention the originality (it's like watching the Simpsons dubbed in French if you get my drift). That point is only driven home even more so since we get , after the movie's end credits, a fake take-out of the boy being auditioned for the role, which is shown in French with subtitles, and you can immediately feel the difference in the voice characters. Shame on the US distributor for ""dumbing down"" the US release. Last but certainly not least, there is a delight soundtrack to this movie, courtesy of Swiss singer-songwriter Sophie Hunger (check out the heartbreaking tune that plays over the end credits). ""My Life As a Zucchini"" got an Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature at the recent Oscars. The fact that it didn't win is besides the point, this is a top-notch quality movie, period. My only other complaint, other than the US theater release being dubbed, is that I wasn't ready to bid farewell to this film after just over an hour... (The screening was rounded out by another Swiss stop-motion animated shortie, the 8 min. delightful ""The Genie In the Box of Raviolis"".) ""My Life As a Zucchini"" opened this weekend at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati and I couldn't wait to see it. The Friday evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (only 6 people, including myself), so I imagine this will not play more than a week in the theater. If you have a chance to catch this later on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, I strongly recommend you do so, you won't regret it. ""My Life As a Zucchini"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
" Many of the most original animated films in recent years have been made in France
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,6,"Ernest & Celestine, A Town Called Panic, The Little Prince, April and the Extraordinary World, Long Way North, Mune: Guardian of the Moon, The Day of the Crows, Song of the Sea, The Secret of Kells, and now My Life as a Courgette. I have been following animated titles closely for the past years. Japan repeats its own tropes. Other Asian countries try new things such as live action puppets / cgi hybrids which have good comedic value, but tends to get old soon. American studio's often have their main focus on agenda rather than content. Russian seems to be so unknown that no one knows about Snow Queen and how Frozen (despite me loving that film) is basically a rip off of it. Other countries have mainly been dropping single titles which end up being disappointing. France is by no means ahead of USA and Japan, but they have confirmed their place as good 3rd. Their main problem being how little animation films they make, despite them having the biggest rate on creating good movies. My Life as a Courgette is once again a worthy title. The movie does an impressive job by being a serious work about life and its problems. While the movie follows young people and their daily life, it is not aimed for young audience - yet is completely suitable for children as well. The movie is rather substance heavy with dramatic concepts which not just any youngster nor even viewer could understand. The impressive part being how much depth the characters have on their personas -despite their young age- and how much realism they deliver.The style is original in the French style. Subdued and minimalist, yet every part is clearly put together with care and lot of planning. I will use the word ""fitting"" to describe the character design, just because I couldn't imagine them looking any other way. Each character is also made with a lot of care and planning. The opposite from Japanese movies where you can tell the main character from rest of the folks by just looking the hair color. In this movie, none of the characters are a filler. ""The night out shot in snowy forest"" scene gave me chills. The OST and bgm managed to surprise me as well. I would go as far and say that French animation movies have made me appreciate the French language which I have always found ugly sounding. It wouldn't be the same movie without the French voice actors. This is really a quality animation film from every aspect. It isn't the best thing ever, but surely an amazing animation title when comparing to general standard. I can not but recommend this to every who enjoys mature content and animation movies. I hope a lot of parents show this movie to their children as well because it has so much to offer."
" Deserving of the accolades
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,6,"""Ma vie de Courgette"" or ""My Life as a Zucchini"" is a Swiss-French co-production from 2016 that resulted in a French-language movie. This is one of the most successful animated films of the years for sure and the recent Oscar nomination (even if it has no shot at winning probably) proves how much everybody ended up liking it. It is a relatively short full feature film, runs for roughly an hour only, not including credits and thus is not too far away from the short film category. The title (Veggie Tales anyone?) and the animation and the main character may have some people think that this is really only a film directed at very young audiences, but this is definitely a wrong statement. The film offers great characters and a truly interesting story. I personally think that the main reason why so many people like this one is the mix of emotion and realism. In the viewing I was in, there was not a single child seeing it, but several grown-ups. I am not saying at all that it is not suitable for teenagers, but that it is suitable for every age. Speaking about emotion, this is a factor that is there from start to finish as the film takes place at an orphanage for the entire time basically. We follow the lives of the characters, especially the one of Zucchini, and how they interact with each other. The kids are all somewhat tortured souls because of how they lost their parents and it's visible all the times through their actions and interactions.As we find out very early, there is another kid that seems like a bit of an antagonist, but the longer the film goes, the more we realize he is another friendly character that maybe just hides his vulnerability behind mannerisms that were supposed to be cool. It's interesting how he starts opening up and respecting Zucchini after he beats him in a fight. It's also interesting how the girl beats him with words on her very first day. This also shows that this cool kid is no antagonist as he still helps the girl in a crucial situation eventually. I quite liked her (Zucchini's love interest) and the scene with the other girl and the hair was as witty and touching as was the comparison between weather and emotional states of the kids. Of course there are grown-up characters too, some good one, some bad ones, but all credible and realistic. This animated film is a prime example of a movie that would also have worked with actors and live action. There are no fantasy elements in here, no talking animals or so, but it is a depiction of real life. The film was really written very well and it is without a doubt one of the most authentic films of 2016. I am definitely closer in giving it a ****/***** than a **/*****. Maybe I will if I re-watch it at some point, which is not unlikely. Until then, I am really glad it has received this much attention. Actually I think the ending is also pretty nice for a possible sequel and who knows with all the success here, it is certainly a possibility. I'd definitely watch it if it ever happens. Please do yourself a favor and check this one out if you have a chance."
