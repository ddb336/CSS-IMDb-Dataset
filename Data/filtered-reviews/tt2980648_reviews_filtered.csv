" Uplifting Beautiful Film
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,10,"I love this film for many reasons. It's filmed beautifully, I love Helen Mirren, Om Puri, Manish Dayal (handsome, woof), Charlotte La Bon..... just wonderful cast and it has an excellent story. Within the story we have bigotry, stubbornness, and love. The Indian family is lovely to behold and seeing a tiny bit of their cuisine is fabulous. I love authentic Indian food, but the only way to really taste is in India and it will blow your mind. Mrs. Mirren is fabulous and getting to know she and Om become enemies to friends is a story of learning to know those who are different, and finding out they are really mostly the same. Food of course is central to the story. Seeing Mr. Dayal sniff his spices one sees his deep love of his home, his family, and his past. I also love the passion for food. One can simply feed, but to truly eat well one has to be able to blend in the ingredients in the correct way to stimulate the senses making eating a love story. Cooking is an art, just like painting and writing. I do believe that some can naturally have a knack for cooking, for knowing when is too much, and not enough. An internal timer that makes a good chef go to one pan or oven to begin the next step. Hardship overcome, beautiful scenery, lovely filming, fantastic acting, a love story, and all mixed together to cook an uplifting film. Perfect? What is, but it's close."
" Charming!
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,6,"The Hundred-Foot Journey is actually a movie I watched in 9th grade. The teacher just played the movie, and no one really knew what we were going to watch. I didn't knew which movie it was in the beginning, and then I understood it, cause my mom told me about this movie once, and how she loved it. I had never thought about watching this movie, and I would never want to watch this on my own.But the movie was quite a surprise. I actually liked the movie a lot, but somethings in the last act ruined a little bit of it. It's not that it was something bad with the movie, but I didn't understand everything that was happening. After reading a little bit about the movie afterwards, I finally understood what the movie was all about. But I forgot this movie very soon, and I just remembered it. That's why I'm writing this review.I liked a lot the first act. The first half hour is pretty awesome. The movie is funny, entertaining, and overall charming. It has some of the movie's best scenes, and it is a pretty awesome scene.The next hour went by so fast, I didn't quite follow it. The last half hour is also a little bit entertaining, but as I said, I didn't understand everything.But this is an entertaining movie. It has some memorable scenes. But it isn't as good as everything else. Every time something funny happened, I looked away. I only got the slow parts of the movie. I miss the time we watched movies like Home Alone, Life Of Brian, and The Nightmare Before Christmas on school. But as a food movie, this is a good movie. Movies, like Ratatouille and Sausage Party, didn't quite live up to the expectations, but neither did this movie. Whatever, I saw this movie without expectations, so it weren't that bad. Food movies ain' quite my type of movie, but if it is yours, then you can enjoy this."
" A good film spoilt by patronising racial message and silly french accents
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,7,This film had potential - so much potentital from a great castInstead it was dumbed down and patronising.The absurdity of Helen Mirren (supposedly french) constantly speaking in English - it would have made it so much more believeable to make her character an Engilsh woman who owned a french restaurantIt should have stuck with the original theme of people instead it kept wandering off into some 'great message'Which spoiled the human story which would have made a great filmI enjoyed the film but it felt it could have been so much better by being som much more realistic about people.
" Uplifting and joyous film
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,10,"Such a lovely film , that ambles through a couple of years . So enjoyable and heart warming"
" You predictable
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,3,"And soppy. You can guess what happens next most of the time, cliched and has a feel of a low budget 90's film.
Some might like it but it's definitely not for me."
" France, Food, & Helen Mirren--Delicious
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,9,"This romantic, slightly comic film is about food, change, and foreigners. An Indian family opens a restaurant in a small town in France, and everyone gets a lesson in acceptance. Schmaltzy, optimistic, yes, but I sure needed something sugar-coated when I watched this in January 2021. The only thing that bothered me about the movie is that the major xenophobic villager is sent packing after he sets the competing restaurant on fire. As he speeds off on his motorcycle, I wondered where he was going. To join the National Front perhaps? Or some neo-Nazi group? Hate is not that easily eliminated."
" But mostly I was taught how to taste
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,8,"Indians opening a restaurant in France from a book by an American, directed by a Swede and it's glorious.
The English so need to consume this.
I feel the need to disclose some personal history:
Englishman who learned to cook in India from an Italian, then married a Frenchwoman, don't ask...
Only practiced the art once I moved to Spain"
" Indomitable Om Puri...
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,8,"It is a culinary culture-clash lighthearted comedy based on the novel by the same name and produced by Steven Speilberg, Oprah Winfrey and Juliet Blake.. commendable performances from both Helen Mirren and my fav the indomitable Om Puri.."
" Ohlala! C'est magnifique!
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,10,"This is that feel-good-don't-watch-it-if-you-are-hungry type of picture! I was drooling half of the time and craving something as simple as a tomato.
And that's the best part of the movie. The sensation that it's so provocative, as far as you almost smell what you see on a screen.
Just wonderful! And Ms. Mirren was breathtaking!Strongly recommend it if you are a bit blue."
" What a lovely film
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,10,"My wife and I stumbled upon this film on channel4 whilst looking for something to entertain us. We live in France and love Indian food and this film filled our evening with flavour. Such a gentle, endearing story (so rare today). I don't often give 10 out of 10 but it just hit the nail right on top of the head. Enjoy!"
" Lacks subtlety
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,7,"It's a well made movie. It really brings that warm romantic flair that fits the movie. But the dialogs and characters are quite uninspiring and the story line is quite predictable. It's all laid on too thick in terms of romantic, fuzzy, warm feeling and it's overloaded with clichés. There's no subtlety or layers in the characters and their dialogues. Which really is a shame, because the potential was there to be a great movie. Also I felt that Hassan had trouble carrying the movie. Yes he has puppy eyes, but his acting was quite mediocre.So all in all it sound like a lot of critique, but it's only because the rest was so well done it deserved more. It's just that very simple but warm and cosy romantic movie for on a lazy Sunday but it just lacks any complexity to be more than that. So, just a 6.5 which on imdb. I'll go for 7 then, because after a few 'oh yeah, really?' cliché annoyances it somewhere halfway did bring me to France and their situation. It's enough to give me a warm and somewhat satisfying feeling."
" Loved it
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,10,"I rarely give ten stars but man this movie is so delightful. I had that huge, stupid smile the whole time I'm watching. Everything about it is so beautiful. One of my favorite things about this movie is that you can feel the food coming out the screen yum!"
" Cuisine and friendship
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,7,"The Hundred-Foot Journey is a pleasant comedy about cuisine and friendship.An Indian family who fled from its country decides to open an Indian restaurant in a little village of France.But in front of them there is Madame Mallory, a very famous chef condecorated with the famous Michelin stars.All looks like a rivalry, but little Papa (the Indian patriarch) and Madame Mallory will find an agreement, Hassan wants to make a carrer as chef and will then make his practice in the kitchen of Madame Mallory with the collaboration of Marguerite.That's all I shall write about the film.
IJust enjoy this nice film about the relationship between people of different culture and about the friendship which will grow in this little place of France.
I enjoy the performances of Helen Mirren (Madame Mallory), Om Puri (Papa) Manish Dayal (Hassan) and Charlotte le Bon (Marguerite)."
" Wonderful
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,10,"2 hours passed by just like that. The scenic view of France, that Indian and French restaurant side by side with superb acting. You will forget everything else and just enjoy that blissful 2 hours of time. Must watch for anyone interested in culinary"
" Becomes predictable after an engaging first half
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,5,"The first half of the movie is very engaging with a good mixture of drama, comedy and cute romance. But the second half become dull. The movie is so intensely based on the rivalry between Om and Helen that it's hard to believe how easily they are allowed to patch up. Plus the romance between Dayal and Le, while cute in the beginning, turns out un-convincing, there is lack of chemistry and their characters are shallow. Overall the viewer knows what will happen in the movie, after the first hour."
" A tasty treat for every pallet.
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,9,"The idea of another motion picture featuring two rivaling restaurants seems bland and even tepid in the mouth of an experienced viewer, however I must say, ""don't knock it til you try it.""Take a big bite of India and France simultaneously while some bickering and well-placed humor opens doors to deep and lasting relationships.Call me simple but a personal distaste that leads to humor which then, leads to friendship can never be overdone if executed well. Add a few spices and a solid cut of meat and you've got yourself something to be described as nothing but spectacular.I didn't want it to end and you won't either. Watch this movie. You won't be sorry you did. I can promise you that much."
" A lovely feel good movie
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,7,"This movie was a good family entertainer. The location, ambience, good portrayal of every character and above all the food, made this movie a worth watch. Loved the portrayal of Helen mirren and Ompuri. Music plays a vital part, which elevated the movie.
Just felt a bit dragged towards the climax, especially when the story moves away from the small beautiful town and goes towards Paris.
But overall a perfect feel good movie which could be watched during a rainy noon."
" ""Maybe brakes break for a reason""
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,7,"A total change of heart (that the character of Helen Mirren experienced just after revealing she's not a one-dimensional) does not a well-rounded character make. This is the only issue I have besides the fact the story treads a very familiar territory, the thing that I didn't mind as much until the third act where things became humdrum due to the predictability of the story. Other than that, I think The Hundred-Foot Journey is a well-prepared, comfortingly traditional and ""classical"" dish that has surprisingly rich ingredients, plus a pinch of romance that didn't only work in its own, but also added a considerable depth to the two characters, especially Marguerite. The cast is all great, but the late Om Puri was just perfect as Papa.(7.5/10)"
" Food for the Gods
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,10,"What a wonderful movie, and the food, I wanted to be there tasting along the way. Wonderful actors, all of them. I want to now learn how to cook all of the food, both sides of the street. Sweet movie, great story!"
" Absolutely perfect
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,9,It's such a good movie that it makes no sense it's not one of the huge classics ....It's a must see for all
" Story , execution, Hellen Mirren and Om Puri what more do you want
",2020-03-06 00:00:00,8,"Fantastic execution, good story, marvelous acting of Hellen Mirren and OM Puri. Well Manish Dayal and Charlotte have there share too. Loved the movie . Those who find happiness in little things give it a go"
" The perfect movie.
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,9,"The perfect movie makes you laugh and cry. It makes you want to be a better person. Not just once one scene, but several of them. This is that perfect movie."
" A refreshing Movie indeed
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,8,"A must watch.
I decided to try this movie out one evening and it did not disappoint.
A simple, refreshing and heart warming story.
This movie did inspire me to cook.
Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a brilliant yet soft plot."
" It just felt good
",2019-11-07 00:00:00,9,"You do not have to be interested in chef's, Paris or India to become invested in everything about this movie. I don't know much about any of those things but I enjoyed it all. It leaves you feeling good and happy for everyone. Usually when you watch a movie that's mostly about people who are a chef they are always yelling and throwing dishes around their kitchen but this movie didn't have all of that and yet we could still feel the passion for feeding people. I would recommend this movie and will probably watch it again later on down the road. That's how I know if I really enjoyed a movie. I can watch a movie more than once or twice IF the movie itself checks off all the boxes"
" No surprises but a lovely movie
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,6,"This was fine, enjoyable with great locations, nicely shot, good story, fantastic acting from Om Ouri , Helen Mirren and Manish Dayal. It just didn't move me in any way and I felt indifferent about the movie as a whole although there's absolutely nothing wrong with it.The plot follows the Kadam family who leave India for France where they open a restaurant directly across the road from Madame Mallory's Michelin-starred eatery. The teenage son finds work with his dad's culinary enemy and with a war between the two eateries brewing he merges French and Indian cuisine with delicious results. There is a bit of romance here but no surprises plot wise. Just a nice feel good movie."
" Throughly enjoyable
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,8,"What a nice suprise this movie! Interesting story, beautifully acted by all, an homage to the French culture and the Indian culture and to humans trying to find each other in their own ways when cultures clash. Its visually really beautifully filmed and wow.... don't get my started about the food!!"
" A feel good film, with a strange change towards the last third or so
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this movie. I thought it was well-done. But the movie seems to completely change into another movie when the son moves away. Perhaps they could have done it better as a parallel story, or just dropped it altogether, and just tried to expand the small town part instead.
Overall, still an enjoyable, feel good movie."
" Great Film.
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,7,"Great movie. Loved the cinematography, landscapes, color.. very rich and warm, and lots of heart. Not sure if it's intended to be funny.. definitely an earnest movie that will even soften up the most cynical movie viewers."
" All that a movie should be!!!!!
",2019-06-29 00:00:00,10,"As a displaced Montrealer and cook, this movie touched me right through the heart to my very soul. The movie deals with multi-layered themes honestly and yet remains a very relaxing film to watch. Adversity, racism, love, family, career, traditions and diversity are subtly interwoven throughout this very enjoyable movie that sports a phenomenal cast, great writing, alluring scenery, sumptuous food, a good musical score and a wonderful ending. Gratefully missing is the vulgarity and crass commercialism found in too many films. I highly recommend this movie and without giving away any spoilers, I will just say, that it is not about the Michelin stars...it is about love, food, home and walking your own walk...it is about ""La passion."""
" The Cinema Paradiso of Food - The Hundred-Foot Journey
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,9,"This film gives a whole new meaning to the label ""The French and Indian War"", the dreary historical topic we were forced to study in primary school preceding the American Revolution. Of course, this film has nothing to do the French and Indian War, other than the primary actors are French and Indian, and in the case of Helen Mirren, English. All the performances are wonderful, and the production values are first-rate. The director, Lasse Hallstrom is letter-perfect and the screenplay by Mr. Knight is beautifully reconstructed around the master novel by Mr. Morais. The film is extremely exotic on several levels. The subplots of two human romances and the ultimate romance of preparing fine food are ingeniously interwoven through the ingenious screenplay.
This film is thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. I read somewhere, that some amateur film critic gave this film two stars. What is two stars is the rating of this film critic. This is a must-see film. If you enjoyed Cinema Paradiso, you will love this film as well."
" A comedy about not only food but also life styles
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,6,"This is a comedy about not only food but also life styles, family relationships and of course love. The movie shows the difficult and problems of an Indian family moving from India to France.The family of a talented cook, Hassan Kadam, has a peaceful and comfortable life in India but all goes upside down when all the family has to quickly move to Europe running away from their country political violence. When the Kadam family arrives in France they set off a typical Indian restaurant just in front of a very famous, luxury, classical and Michelin-starred French restaurant. This circumstances brings out the many differences between their cultures, motivations and life styles.The film is very funny and has a lot of extremely amusing situations. In the cast stands out the winner of an academy Oscar, Helen Mirren, who plays the character of the French restaurant owner. The rest of the main characters are played by Indian actors not so well known in Europe, but they also do an excellent job.I truly recommend seeing ""The hundred-foot journey"", of course is not the best movie ever but it's an easy to see film, really funny and enjoyable where you will see the differences between two cultures, two life styles and two ways of cooking."
" This one's a nice one!
",2019-04-04 00:00:00,6,"Film: A 100 Foot Journey
Rating: 3/5
Review: 100 foot journey is not a film.... Its actually about taste. It gives us the absolute mental status of a chef. Other than a chef, the film focuses on various aspects such as love of a father, departion of loved ones and most of all Kerala.... The film never loses its focus from its motto which is 'Hassan'. It consistently keeps Hassan in plot whether he is actually present on the screen or not. Just like a food requires ingredients and spices, the film contains well performed acting and a variety of emotions. Om Puri knew his role in and out and gave the character an insecure and loving father. Dayal too cuts an endearing figure as talented Hassan, turning into hot property via ""Maydam"", one coriander omelet at a time. His romance with Le Bon could've had more steam - but there's one scene of jagged jealousy, where Marguerite resents Hassan's success, that stands out. Similarly, Madame's head chef Jean, who smoulders with resentful racism, brings a dash of bitter reality to this picture-postcard land. But such reality-bites are fleeting here. This is a food fairytale which prefers the sweet to the tart, cream to the karelas of life.
Yet, it takes all those tastes to create a great dish. Juhi Chawla might not add to the story but the film didn't move out of the script but gave its best to be in it.
This one's a nice one.
The film might also be said as a presentation of the harsh and beautiful reality without the elements of a film but rather emotions and reality."
" Wonderfully ""served up""!
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,9,"Restaurants are the main theme of this film. a MUST Watch! Great cast with Helen Mirren and Om Puri. Really great film for all the family with more than just ""food"" served up here. Wonderful script, great acting, great viewing!"
" It shows the plot of delicious food.
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,6,"It shows the plot of delicious food. It always feels too little, and other content is too noisy to dominate. The soundtrack and the scenery are beautiful."
" Movie with a treat to tounge..
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,9,It's such a pleasant movie and a treat to watch.. It's a foodie delight. Everyone acted so well and is a treat to watch on puri in this role.
" Cute premise well acted but last 30 minutes drag a bit.
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,7,Story revolves about young Indian chef who emigrates to France and becomes famous. The love story is a secondary plot line. Helen Mirren plays a French restauranteur with her usual Oscar quality panache.I would have preferred if the film ended about 30 minutes earlier than it does.
" Well made, but...
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,5,... a basically cynical story of post-imperial neo- colonialism masquerading as multi-culturalism.
" Absolutely delicious
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,9,"I certainly didn't expect to like this movie, let alone LOVE it. The Hundred-Foot Journey is a subtle masterpiece set in the beautiful French countryside. Not only is the cuisine excellent so are the performances that are scattered throughout this film.Manish Dayal is clearly the centerpiece and does an exceptional job, before this the only time I had seen him was in Law and Order: SVU. Helen Mirren is also a powerhouse throughout the film, but that is to be expected from someone of her caliber.The movie overall is quite delicious, full of fun moments and plenty of moments that will make you stop and appreciate the plot. Would definitely recommend and will probably watch again."
" The most beautiful movie about humans that I have ever seen
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,10,"If you want your spirit to be enchanted, captivated and gently massaged into recalling all of the love of life that you have forgotten during your daily struggles to achieve more, then this is the best 2 hour respite that will guarantee that.
Every actor is superb, the storyline is very unique, as well as believable, with some of the best cinematography you will ever have the privilege to watch.Just take a break from your life's stressors, put your feet up and enjoy this one of a kind creation."
" EVERY BITE TAKES YOU HOME
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,10,A family from India breaks down in a small French village and decides this will be the spot to start a restaurant. They buy an abandon place across from Madame Mallory (Helen Mirren) a woman who is ruthless in her competition. There is a small Romeo and Juliet element that was not overly developed. Predicable? Without a doubt.Helen Mirren gave us another great performance. The film was more about Hassan (Manish Dayal) being a cook than the rivalry which was relatively short lived.
" Just wonderful 💛
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,10,"It is a beautiful movie. These says, it becomes more and more difficult to find a movie that sends good vibes along with some good life lessons, in a serene and positive atmosphere. I liked it a lot and I would recommend it for a movie night with friends, family, or just a cup of hot chocolate. Enjoy!"
" It's been a long wait!
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,8,Did not fast forward or have the urge to fast forward. Loved every moment. Sweet with substance.
" Great movie
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,10,"Loved it. Cinematography was outstanding, shot beautifully. Setting, cast, story line just terrific. Just perfect."
" Sweet story of family, food and discovery
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'The Hundred-Foot Journey' was a little like 'Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' for me - I had quite low expectations as I thought it was going to be an ""old lady movie"". Thankfully, I was proven wrong and instead was treated to a nice little film about following your dreams.The premise is simple - an Indian family move to London, get sick of the cold/rain (who wouldn't!) and travel to continental Europe to find a new place to settle and start a restaurant. This place happens to be a picturesque little village in Southern France - however, their new restaurant happens to be next to a Michelin-rated French restaurant, and a rivalry ensues.The performances from Puri as the Dad and Mirren as the French restaurant owner are great and quite nuanced, with Hassan (Daval) and Marguerite (the huge-eyed Le Bon) playing the young love interests/competing chefs. It's great to see how their friendship evolves as Hassan goes on his food journey. Some parts of this feel like a cooking show, but not enough to put you off. It has funny moments, touching moments and a nice ending - plenty of messages about openness and accepting other cultures, and generally giving something/someone a chance."
" A Good Production Value; A Not-So Good Story
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,4,"I didn't know what to expect with this movie. The only reason I watched it was because my family likes it, so I watched it with them. I was interested in the beginning but soon discovered how predictable the story is. I saw almost every major event coming 5-20 minutes before it happened. This, of course, sucked out the enjoyment for me.The shots of food were very appetizing and colorful (despite watching on a DVD player which seems very blurry nowadays). The cinematography was good; there were many shots that looked very good. I can't recall there even being a soundtrack, so take that how you will. I noticed that the pacing wasn't very good. Near the beginning of the second act, I thought it was going to end because the pacing was very slow and there was no more conflict. There was nothing more to continue the story until later on when another predictable event happened. Half an hour before the movie ended, I already knew exactly how it was going to end and got extremely bored.Overall, I wouldn't watch this movie unless you want mindless feel-goodness."
" Slick
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,8,Slick... over produced...unrealistic...trite but tearful...
" review
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,10,"This is the best comedy for me.The film ""The Hundred foot journey"" is a very interesting and moving film.The actors are good and sometimes funny. I like this film because it's a nice story with some actors and wonderful places. I love this film! If you like moving films,watch ""The Hundred Foot Journey""."
" A cute, heart warming afternoon movie
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,6,"I certainly enjoyed this film and it made me smile. IMDb classes this as comedy and drama but I wouldn't say there is much drama in it. You know who will fall in love and the plot follows exactly the journey you expect. It's not on the level of something like Four Weddings where you laugh, you cry, you smile, you cover your mouth with your hand in shock but it's still worth a watch if you want a little heart warming and not much of a challenge.Manish Dayal (Hassan) and Charlotte Le Bon (Marguerite) are the eye candy but the real stars here are, of course, Helen Mirren (Madame Mallory) and Om Puri (Papa). Their initial warring did make me smile, though it isn't laugh out loud, and their eventual romance is genuine and subtle.Everyone has a heart of gold and those who don't are (as with all good comedy romances) served their just desserts following their indiscretions.Helen Mirren yet again proves how much she deserves that Oscar. You really can't go wrong when you see her name in the cast."
" Superb
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,10,"I'm upset with myself that I took so long to getting around to watching this film. I just finished it, and it is wonderful, on all levels. It is a wonderful human story featuring great actors and fantastic-looking food. Everything which needs to be said about this film has already been written, so I'll just say Watch It!"
" Never too old to learn who you really are and what you stand for
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,8,"Lovely film, like sitting around a warm fire. So many topics covered in this interesting film, about cooking and why many of us are so passionate about it! Flavours and where they take us, when we taste them, used as a vehicle to enhance the story line of this enjoyable film. Family, Racism, love, both young and older, patriotism, competitiveness, by seeing the other person's point of view and pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, opening your mind up to new things or ways of doing things and new experiences. Many times a mixture of different ways of doing something, improve the end result. What drives us, realizing, at the end of the day, what is truly important. Kindness, family and friends support. Allowing yourself to believe that people's intentions are good. Wonderful acting performances by the 4 main characters, whilst set in a dream location."
" Weak but watchable
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,5,"How interested am I in food movies? Well not that much it turns out! I didn't actually dislike this film as it is quite pretty to look at especially some of the fresh young faces (and also the ones not so young). But it sets out to be a ""feel-good movie"" and so it follows that it is distinctly unchallenging in its characterisations, themes and story lines. Young man, would-be chef, overcomes some not very painful challenges to make good and win the girl,ho-hum.The Helen Mirren character sets out to be the baddie but is won over. In fact no-one is very bad except one character who is cast out and rides off on his iron horse. After that everything is just ""lovely"". All the events in the movie are telegraphed from a mile away. The Indian family could have been interesting if their characters had been developed, except it doesn't really happen except for the father who I thought did act well. I would have to describe it as a weak movie except for the eye candy aspects which keep you watching, despite not having much respect for the whole affair. Overall it just hovers on the pass mark, 5/10."
" Heartwarming + Mouth watering
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,8,"Oh boy! What a wonderful film. I'll keep it simple. Just as the summary said, this movie is about a journey of a chef, Hassan Kadam who love to cook from a mere small stall chef in remote village in India that became a chef who earned 3 Michelin star in France. His rivalry with Madam Mallory pushed him to cook beyond what accustomed to his family (Indian food) in France (Cuisine's Heaven maybe?) and his love for Marguerite make him want to cook more than just for Michelin star. In this movie you can see some mouth watering dishes from both Indian & French cuisine and the director did a good job making the dishes looked tasty. Story wise, it's great considering the balance between cooking, love & motivational at the same time. If you're looking Michael Bay kind of movie, this movie is not for you. But if you're in the mood for heartwarming story, this movie is definitely for you to watch on movie night with your family. Oh! And please prepare to be hungry."
" Flavorful Foods; Vanilla Story
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)A restaurateur from India moves his family to France. They set up shop across (100 feet to be precise) from a critically acclaimed fine dining restaurant with a 2 star Michelin rating. Can fine dining and Indian cuisine maintain friendly relations? That's the overarching plot. The sub plot is the Indian son is a cooking protégé and the fine-dining owner wants to recruit him for her mentorship. Once he experiences the top end, will he begin to miss his downhome Indian ways? The movie was nicely shot, picturesque and well-produced. Serviceable script yet the editing had some abrupt scenes directional changes; didn't blend well together. Toss in a girl/boy romance and you get the picture. The core plot is good; told in a family friendly manner."
" underwhelming
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,4,"This is NOT a foodie movie. It is dumbed down Hollywood crap. It is full of dull clichés. It had so much potential, and wasted all of it trying to appeal to all and sundry. A genuine movie would have had French people speaking French, Indian speaking Indian, with subtitles and only English when they speak to each other. The setting and the light is beautiful, the rest is completely forgettable."
" Tres magnifique
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,9,"This movie is the gem of all spices. Sweet, sour, spicy and bitter, i thas everything and yet it blends it so well, stirs it so good, creating flavor out of thin air, encasing wisdom where none may dwell. The scenes are beautifully lit, the landscape is gorgeously depicted into a Turkish delight for your eyes, you get a sense of art and yet its moving and thrilling. The director thought to follow a different line than the one usually depicted as ""generic"" and obtained something so valuable yet uniquely so, appetizing. You can literally taste this movie, each moment and sip it as if you'd enjoy a sparkling wine along side a full course meal. The protagonist is your ideal person, unchained by arrogance yet bound by desire and hope, he is able to forge his path in the midst of strife yet unyielding and committed even in peril and adversity. The two parents are an idiom of experiences and memories, bringing together the generation and cultural gap of two different eras. Their families aren't just there for support and to offer doubt or confidence, but they act, they live and breath as if they were real. The whole village-town scene, the market, coffee shops, town hall and so forth, is the proof of ""union cuisine"", merging two different styles and cultures into one, creating a new history and a new culture. A symbiosis with no equal, this is the true 3 star of this movie. I highly recommend it. Regards, Syrus G"
" Predictable and soppy European-based film made by Americans
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,2,"Overall, this is a fairly poor film. The first half was moderately enjoyable, though it was easy to predict how things would unfold. Once the main character gets a career break and heads to Paris (ie.. the second half of the film), it becomes bland, pointless and boring. In fact, at times I felt like two different films were made and joined together as it transitioned from a mildly amusing drama to a melodramatic vapid Hollywood drama.Spielberg and Oprah were producers - Americans making a European film... Needless to say that it has some ridiculous touches as a result. For instance, the main character starts having wine with dinner ... in Paris .. to indicate that he's dulling his pain by turning to drinking. Laughable. About 50 minutes of the last hour could (should) have been left on the cutting room floor. The love aspect of the film was totally predictable, though unconvincing. The ""quickie"" they have towards the end of the film was a truly eye-rolling addition.Strangely it also fails as a foodie film. Aside from the overly predictable and silly ""French with Indian influences"" cuisine thing, there are flat out mistakes from anyone who knows a thing or two about French cooking. Hollandaise sauce is made with clarified butter, not oil. The latter is used to make mayonnaise. Furthermore, you would never take Hollandaise sauce on a picnic as the butter would solidify. One of many.Nit picking aside, it's ultimately hard to identify where the film is a legitimate success and it's not recommended viewing!"
