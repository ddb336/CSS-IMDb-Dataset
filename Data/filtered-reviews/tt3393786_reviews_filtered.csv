" Unbelievable Dung !
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,1,"He never shaves but is always clean-shaven. He never goes to the toilet, or changes his underwear throughout this lame film ! And the whole secret is explained by a hobo in New Orleans !The only regrettable issue in this film is that they could have filmed entirely in California and saved a heap of Mr Cruise's money ..."
" generic
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,5,"After the opening scene everybody in this movie talks in fast forward. The entire movie.Other than that its quite generic, nothing you haven't seen many times before."
" Good watch
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,10,"It's a Tom Cruise movie, Tom Cruise action, his own stunts and delivered from a 5.7 stature.People looking for anymore substance need to watch.Color purple
River runs through it.
Or dead poets society.
End of conversation"
" Good But...
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,6,"I really enjoy the Jack Reacher character and was looking forward to seeing another showing only to discover they had given all the good bits to his sidekick.I want to watch Reacher not someone else going 'yeh I can do that to'. Fine, get your own movie! lol.Now it looks to be getting rebooted so will watch keenly for that release."
" Never should have gone back...
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,4,"This is a prime example of how to flunk out on a sequel. Different crew. Badly planned screenplay. Too many side characters that don't make any difference. Mystery solved with main character. Entire formula tossed out from first film to this gimpy second one.I mean who doesn't like the excellent (obviously storyboarded) opening sequence of the first film? Every camera shot was precise. Main character introduced without any words. Simply great. Stark comparison to this heap. Too bad, could have been a great trilogy but this one axed that plan. Sigh."
" The title of this ""film"" serves as a serious warning.
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,4,"""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" (2016), following the unexpected surprise of the first movie, I did not expect a sequel to be made. ""Jack Reacher"" (2012) was an absolutely amazing film, to say the least. It had a complete storyline and you left the movie totally satisfied and without wanting anymore. Two years later, there were no announcements regarding any ""Jack Reacher"" sequels. I thought: ""all right, it's no big deal. At this point, we don't need any followup films."" In most cases, it's around one to three years between film releases in a franchise. But about a year after that, ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" was announced to be in production. Needless to say, I was a little surprised to hear about that. But, I just thought to myself: ""how bad can it be?"" I went to go see it in the theater, and I was very disappointed with it. This ""film"" has a dull and cliched storyline, average to terrible acting, and a boring soundtrack. The storyline is, Jack Reacher and a framed Army major reveal a dark conspiracy. Let me tell you something, it is just as boring as it sounds. This ""movie"" may be 12 minutes shorter than the first one, but it honestly feels so much longer. Even though it isn't! There's even a sub-plot going on where it's assumed that Jack Reacher has a daughter, played by Danika Yarosh. As you can imagine, that plot goes absolutely nowhere and amounts to nothing. The idea for the main storyline is somewhat interesting, I just wish it was more heavily focused on. Keep in mind, this ""film"" has three writers. That's right, it has three of them and the first movie had only one. Yet, a team of three script writers couldn't come up with a good story? Wow, that's pretty bad when a solo writer comes up with a better script than a team of three! The only good thing in this ""film"" are the action scenes. Most of them were actually pretty good, but action scenes are no substitute for poorly written screenplays. As I've said many times, action scenes have to be earned from the result of a great plot line. If the story is bad, then the action scenes will mean nothing. You might see action scenes happening, but you don't experience them. Another issue is that the storyline is marred by the questionable daughter sub-plot. That part should have just been written out of the ""film"" altogether, and then it may have been more on the right track. Sadly, we can't have every miracle happen at once with bad writers. As far as the acting goes, it's overall a letdown. The best acting performances in this ""movie"" come from Tom Cruise, Cobie Smulders and Patrick Heusinger. They're the only ones who actually appear to be putting forth some resemblance of effort. Tom Cruise and Cobie Smulders do have decent chemistry on-screen and Patrick Heusinger didn't do too bad as the villain. It just goes to show that the story had potential, but unfortunately, lazy script writing prevented them from giving it their all. That's one of the worst things with bad movies, wasted potential. As for the rest of the acting, it's just average to terrible. You know it has to be bad when even Tom Cruise can't save a bad movie! The soundtrack is nothing short of generic. You can really tell that this film score rushed together at the last second. It does have some good parts, but overall, it's nothing but your pedestrian action movie soundtrack. Now, let's get to the only two good elements in this pile of trash. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""movie"" a decent atmosphere. As far as the special effects go, they are very well-done, which is no surprise, being a film made in 2016. ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" is a waste of time. Still, to this day, I'm shocked at how bad this ""movie"" turned out to be, such a letdown! I'm giving this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Bottom line, just stay away from this ""movie"". It will do nothing but disappoint you, especially if you love the first film. Like I said, take the title of this ""movie"" as a warning."
" Not as good as the first
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,7,"Now don't get me wrong I did enjoy this film. But I just didn't vibe with it like I did with the first instalment.Now it's an action packed film. Lots of decent fighting, guns and other things you expect to see in a action film. The plot is an easy one to understand and one that keeps you in suspense throughout. But I just had some issues with it, which stops it being the level the first film was at.So a big part of this film is the whole ""daughter"" thing and I just didn't vibe with it. I just didn't fit the Jack Reacher character and that was quite visible throughout. The daughter character as well I didn't understand. At the beginning she's made out to be this hardcore, doesn't listen to anyone teen. But her character completely switches with the flick of a switch and she's this nice, compassionate girl. I just didn't get the immediate switch. The plot itself didn't really have any sort of twist that the first one had. It was a lot more linear and expected. As mentioned it does keep you in suspense, but nothing more. I thought the ending was a little dragged out as well. We knew what the outcome would be a good half an hour before and it would just add another fight in there. And another one. And another one. Just end.Perhaps this maybe deserves a 6/10 and not 7, but I'm feeling generous. Listen, it's a good action film that did entertain me. But nothing more."
" Don't waste your time
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,4,"I had some expectations but I was disappointed.
A sequel that never should have been turned.
I mean every line is predictable far away and there was no suspense. It's really a great sleeper.
Don't know why Tom Cruise made this and then
in the Mission Impossible movies every plot is studied in each detail and even the action scenes are better executed. Fortunately I didn't spent a cent cause I watched it on Netflix. But I turned it off before and I'm not at all interested what happened at the end. Now I warned you.
Don't waste your time. 4/10."
" Letdown
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,5,"I absolutely love Lee Childs Jack Reacher books. It baffles me how the part of a 6'5"" man mountain has gone to Cruise who is a virtual dwarf by comparison, at best mediocre actor and all around creepy guy. The movie itself is your standard Hollywood action flick, i.e middle of the road and nowhere near as good as the book. The only positive is the addition of the delightful Miss Smulders who as well as having been excellent in How I Met Your Mother is ridiculously attractive and somehow manages to still be so as a buff, hard army officer. The Jack Reacher series has (had?)the potential to be huge but much like his 1st big screen outing it's another huge letdown."
" Good but not as good as the first
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,8,"In short summary this is a decent and thoroughly enjoyable action movie that fails to live up to the original.The sequel doesn't really follow on from the first movie in any real storyline so could quite easily be watched independently.The plot sees Reacher quickly find himself in the middle of a military police matter following the arrest of a Major. The movie seeks to see Reacher uncover the truth.It's a well made movie with some great action and enjoyable fight scenes and Tom Cruise puts in another decent performance. However the story is fairly predictable.l and some of the military characters are very cliche.Having watched the original and thought it was excellent, I feel there is something missing, that being said I enjoyed it from start to finish. Shame there isn't anymore."
" No good
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,3,"Compared to the first Jack Reacher movie, this one lacks everything. Bad acting, stupid manuscript. Just no good."
" What a load of b*ll*x!
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,2,PC crap; so crap I had to watch most of it in fast forward! Don't waste your time!!!
" Predictable, Bland Trash
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,6,"The first Jack Reacher had everything. A cool plot that kept you on the edge of your seat combined with good dialogue and character growth. This film completely makes the 'franchise' take a big step back, so would be enough for Tom Cruise and his wallet to 'never go back'. If the word predictable applied to any film, i'm sure Film Schools would use this as an example. I sat watching, predicting the next line. You can tell when things come up that they're be relevant later, it's so in your face. The characters have no appeal, the direction is bland, Cruise becomes boring and the film doesn't feel like the first at all. I would put it in the same category as the Mummy- uses the star power to sell tickets and cuts over script and any real thrill. If you want a good action movie with a thrilling plot, maybe look at a proper franchise like Taken, Die Hard, and not an attempt to keep Tom Cruise relevant outside of another action franchise on its last legs. 6/10"
" Edward Zwick did one good film and it was clearly a fluke (The Last Samuri)
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,4,"Women STrONK, white man BAD film 101.I could add more to this review but overall it its pretty awful compared to the first film.
Women says ""we are being followed"" whilst wearing no bra with the tightest t-shirt ever , army fatigues and a cap in the middle of a suburban environment...
Arms raised in chopping motions whilst looking like carrying carpets under them in multiple running in scenes to make it feel like its action...
Manly female cast member ""clears"" a room by poking her head around one corner and not bothering to check the other....I really don't understand why screenwriters and authors feel that Women actors need to be portrayed like a man. Its almost like military reenactors pretending to be real military to make up for the fact they couldn't complete basic military training. These sorts of films are just the worst!
Cobie Smulders also proves that she received far too many big films since her debut with the Rock in walking tall.
Don't let the overtones of feminism ruin the film for you. It will do a pretty good job with bad scenes, bad acting, bad film logic and overall terrible story telling.Give it a miss if you love JR1PS: Edward Zwick - go back to LS if you want to make a good film again"
" Could have done without all that feminist cr*p
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,3,"This franchise has been contaminated by feminism and nobody is going to make a third movie.
What killed it in my opinion is the scene in the hotel where Tom Cruise asks his strong independent female co-star to look after his daughter while he goes out and does stuff. Strong independent woman then throws a hissy fit and begins complaining like a stereotypical woman. How dare Tom Cruise assume she would have maternal instinct?! How dare he treat her like a woman and not like a dude?! Doesn't Tom Cruise know that she is a strong wamhan! Waaahhh! Most people would have switched off at that point, I certainly did.
Oh, and nobody cared about the daughter either.
Edge Of Tomorrow handled a female lead beautifully, no whining no whinging. Couldn't do that in this movie though..."
" It missed McQuarrie
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,7,"This is a serviceable sequel but I think it was missing McQuarrie's touch. It looked cheap at times and I could have done without the ""daughter"" storyline but the action was solid and Cobie needs an action franchise of her own."
" Jack Reacher: never did bother
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,2,Tom Cruise is aways pretty cool but...You absolutely don't care about the characters in this movie for one second. Cobie Smulders delivers her worst performance in her entire career and we never get a fulfilling intro and setup for the movie.The first Jack Reacher was decent. This one is sloppy executed and just lazy written.
" Totally a cliché of the gender, Never Go Back is as good as the first Jack Reacher, maintaining the same quality in every way, but now with greater depth in the characters
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,6,"In addition to the name of star Tom Cruise at the head of the entire production, the film had a climate of suspense and action that seemed to emulate those of the thrillers of the 70s a little and brought curiosity to director Werner Herzog as a sinister villain. Despite this, the reception of the film was not as expected and the possibility of a continuation started to raise doubts. However, the box office in the rest of the world turned out to be satisfactory and a sequence was approved. With Christopher McQuirre now only as a producer, the command passes to the competent Edward Zwick (Blood Diamond (2006), Glory (1989), Legends of the Fall (1994)) and who had previously worked with Cruise on The Last Samurai (2003), who adapts the 18th book in the Jack Reacher series, by author Lee Child. Because we are talking about an action movie in the style of hundreds of others that we see out there, from 007 to Assassin at Fixed Price, the work does not require prior knowledge of the character, since everything we need to know is already more than exposed in your script. Despite falling into old clichés and bringing absolutely nothing new, the feature film stands out for some points that are out of the ordinary when it comes to other productions of the genre.The plot revolves around Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise), a former major (something that is ceaselessly repeated throughout the film), who ends up having to free an army officer, Major Turner (Cobie Smulders), from a conspiracy within the organization that ends up putting it in military prison. Pursued by the military police and a group of mercenaries, the two must get to the bottom of this mystery in order to finally be free. In the midst of it all, Reacher discovers that he possibly has a daughter, Samantha (Danika Yarosh), and she soon becomes another target for the people who hunt them.The script for this sequence, written by Zwick himself with Richard Wenk and Marshall Herskovitz tries to humanize the protagonist and, as a consequence, loses exactly the element that makes the first one fun: his visceral side. To complicate matters, this continuation sounds generic and the clichés multiply with each scene. ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" fulfills its function of entertainment and is correct, but does not enhance or enhance the previous film (on the contrary), and this is what a sequel should do. We do not see any major reversal here that is not predictable and, in fact, the text, for the most part, dispenses with this feature, admitting exactly its condition: that of an action film made exactly for those who want to have a relaxed experience in the cinema.Quite different from the first film, which carries a whole investigative air, with the cold of suspense and the charm of epiphanies at crucial moments, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is attached to the human side of the ex-major and investigator of the American army, and the pace is characterized by escapes and violent encounters after trials. Interspersing all this, we have internal conflicts in the trio of fugitives. The first big difference from The Last Shot for Never Go Back is the fact that Reacher now needs to learn to deal with two situations that he is not used to: the first one is to work as a team or with a partner, since Turner is practically a Jack Female Reacher. The second situation is the character's ""cold"" character, which was mitigated by the script that tries to humanize him more and create unnecessary subplots like his relationship with the alleged daughter, which reduces the intensity that the film could carry. The key point of the script is the suspense, regarding the true explanation of the facts unfavorable to Major Turner. When everything makes sense, there is a lack of creativity in the plot, quite standard in the action suspense subgenre and without any intelligence. Nevertheless, the chance to go further was there.
The script mentions misogynist in the army, the topic is faced, but the confrontation succumbs in the face of Reacher's unwavering power. Once again, the woman is seen as fragile, vulnerable and powerless. The protagonist's loneliness is also present, again in a shallow way. The comic relief, always punctual, does not eclipse the unpalatable exaggerations, also punctual (especially in the plane scene). The protagonist's attempt to humanize was a good idea, however, very poorly executed. It is beneficial that he has a daughter, but his insertion in the narrative is artificial, compelling and uncomfortable. In addition, several holes are clear and annoying: It is hard to believe that an experienced military and rule-following like Turner does not know in advance that the army would block their access to the system and their email. In the same way, the whole justification of Sam's mother's lawsuit against Reacher doesn't make much sense, after all she had never even seen him (in fact, the book provides a better explanation, but in the film it is incoherent). It also displays some obvious developments. The scene in which Turner teaches Sam how to get rid of a captor if taken hostage makes it clear that he will be inevitably captured by the villains and will use the coup to get out of a complicated situation (which obviously happens).With a very conventional tone, Edward Zwick delivers a bureaucratic cadence film, with punctual and reasonably competent action scenes, but without daring or trying to create any memorable sequence, a curious shyness for a director who has made more ambitious films in the past, including Cruise himself, as in ""The Last Samurai"". What the work gets right, while many others fail, are its most agitated scenes. The filmmaker gives us frames that do not confuse us, allowing us to see what is happening in each fight or chase. Despite the countless cuts, there is a clear clarity of what is happening on the screen, enabling a greater use of the film as a whole. Unfortunately, many of these sequences end up being too long or repetitive.The film is effective in creating the impression that the protagonists are cornered and that there is a real danger about them. That didn't happen at first, when Reacher always seemed to be ahead of his opponents to the point that nothing they did sounded like a threat. There is a constant feeling that they are isolated, with no one to trust except for one another and the only weapon they have is their own cunning. It even creates cool situations in which Reacher's skills in improvising and investigating are constantly being exploited. In addition, the battles reflect the relentless and direct nature of the protagonist, who always moves to inflict as much damage as possible on his enemies and benefits from the fact that Cruise does most of his action scenes.Tom Cruise is charismatic and full of energy as usual, bringing intensity and Reacher, a man who does not seem to be able, although he clearly wants to, show affection for his daughter and always seems to approach everything with an excessively pragmatic look. Cobie Smulders makes Major Turner a tough military, but with a strict moral code that does not welcome the way Reacher constantly takes the law into his own hands. She is also as capable and resourceful as Reacher, but he (and the film itself) seems to treat her more as an underling than an equal. Okay, she calls Reacher's attention to her behavior, but he still treats her with some condescension and the narrative itself leaves her more of an assistant than a partner, even though this story is more hers than his. Sam helps bring a more human side to the protagonist and benefits from the good chemistry he has with both Smulders and Cruise.Jack Reacher: Never Go Back has some good action scenes, highlighting the final scenes involving a walking chase through the streets and over the roofs of houses in the middle of a street festival. However, the way the narrative develops is quite dull, full of coincidences and meaningless situations to justify the next shooting, which are, unsurprisingly, the best moments of the work. Highlight for the soundtrack of the Englishman Henry Jackman (Kingsman: Secret Service) that brings moments of pure energy with others more emotional.Overall, Never Go Back is as good as the first Jack Reacher, maintaining the same quality in every way, but now with greater depth in the characters, especially in Reacher. For some it will be more of a cliché film, which is not a lie, but everything is executed with a good quality and keeps the public's interest. The big problem of the film is not to leave the same and more, and to be so generic leaving the feeling that you are watching a sequel that cannot be justified. Everything in the film seems just a jumble of scenes and situations seen in dozens of other similar films, even following the predictable order of events. Without surprises or anything that makes it at least relevant, ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" is a film that does not bother, but neither marks, and this is the worst defect of the work."
" May not match 2012's effort but there is still fun to be had
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,7,"A suitably entertaining sequel, even if it is a downgrade on the very good original.'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back' sees a whole new cast, with one obvious exception, and that does affect my enjoyment - not a fan of major cast changes, myself. Still, the newcomers all add a decent amount with their performances. The premise, meanwhile, is less interesting than that of 'Jack Reacher', but it still makes for solid action.Tom Cruise (Jack) is, as you'd predict, the clear best part of this follow-up. That man does a lot of productions in this genre, in that regard his performance doesn't feel majorly different from his other work but the film is at its highest point when he is onscreen. Cruise is joined by the pleasing Cobie Smulders (Turner) and satisfactory Danika Yarosh (Samantha). Elsewhere, you have the underused duo of Aldis Hodge (Espin) and Robert Knepper (James).In conclusion, this may not match 2012's effort but there is still fun to be had."
" A Lame Movie Based on a Lame Book
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,1,"This movie is the equivalent of elevator music, it played along dully and pleasantly, barely registering, not disturbing me in the slightest as I washed the dishes, played some online Scrabble and searched for other movie recommendations on my phone. This is what happens when you make a movie based on an uninspired character from a by-the-numbers ""action hero"" book written by a not particularly talented writer. I tried to read one of the books and found that it couldn't hold my interest, I had to get off the elevator at the next floor. Many reviewers express outrage at Cruise playing the character of Reacher, explaining that Reacher is supposed to be a 6'5, 250lbs, blond ""force of nature"" (the Ivan Drago of ex-military police) and demand that the movie makers stop ruining Lee Child novels. Yes, you could accurately cast the Jack Reacher character with someone meeting the physical statistics detailed in the books, but the movies would still be trite and throwaway as a result of the weak source material. The reason Cruise opted to use the Reacher books as a movie vehicle is because he knew he would have an easy, zero effort franchise opportunity with a massive viewer base on his hands. Pick a grocery checkout rack bestseller lapped up by the non-discerning masses, bang out a few screenplays and cash in. I'm sure that he had himself cast in the title role because it feels nice to relive his glory days and still be able to see himself as an action hero. Apparently the rights have been taken over by Amazon and the next vehicle will be a TV series; I'm sure Amazon will please the rabid fans, cast a large blond man to play the lead role and churn out season after season after season, much like Child has churned out book after book after book for decades. Apparently the books are all ""self-contained"" stories and rely little, if at all on preceding books in the franchise. As such, you will probably be in store for little Jack Reacher A-Team style adventures to fill your boots for at least a decade, fans. Maybe they can slap a blond wig on Batista or some other wrestler-turned-actor and give you what you deserve. Enjoy!"
" Ignore the bad reviews
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,9,"I started to watch this with low expectations seeing that the average score was 6.1
What I found was a very good action film - I haven't read the book as it feels like the bad reviews are often from people saying Cruise is mis-cast
Watch it with an open mind, Cruise gives a solid performance, the story is good and it's never boring so just lock reality outside for a couple of hours and enjoy"
" Jack Reacher: Never Go Back
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,5,"The first movie was pretty good, despite the questions of casting the lead actor, I kept missing the sequel a few times when it started showing on television, but I watched it eventually, directed by Edward Zwick (Glory, Legends of the Fall, The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond). Basically, drifter and former Army military police officer Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise, also producing) has returned to his old military headquarters, after busting a human trafficking ring on US Army land. He has been working with Major Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders) by phone during his travels, who is holding his former command. He learns from Colonel Sam Morgan (Holt McCallany) that Turner has been accused of espionage and detained. According to Turner's attorney, Colonel Moorcroft, there is evidence that Turner is responsible for the murders of two soldiers in Afghanistan, but Reacher believes she has been framed. Moorcroft also tells him Reacher's old acquaintance, Candice Dutton, plans to sue him for paternity charges, claiming he is the biological father of her 15-year-old daughter, Samantha (Danika Yarosh). Reacher tries to reach out to Samantha, but she rebuffs him. Moorcroft is later killed by an assassin known as The Hunter (Patrick Heusinger), framing Reacher for the murder. Reacher is arrested and transported to the same prison where Turner is being held. When two hitmen arrive, Reacher neutralises them, then escapes with Turner. They go to Morgan's house, deducing that he is involved in the conspiracy, and extract information. The Hunter, revealed to be working with Morgan, later kills Morgan, again framing Reacher. Reacher and Turner see surveillance pictures of Samantha and realise she is in danger. They arrive at her home to find her foster parents dead and Samantha hiding. Samantha is taken to Turner's old private school for protection, but Samantha uses a mobile phone, which the enemy is likely tracking. They make a quick exit, during which Samantha steals credit cards from one of the students. The trio go to New Orleans in search of Daniel Prudhomme, the only eyewitness to the murders for which Turner has been framed. During the escape from the airport, Reacher admits to Samantha he might be her father. Reacher and Turner find Prudhomme (Austin Hébert) in a derelict location, learning that he is connected to Parasource, a private military organisation that is trying to cover up the murders. Reacher contacts Turner's friend, Captain Anthony Espin (Aldis Hodge), to move Prudhomme into custody, but assassins ambush them and kill Prudhomme, while Reacher rescues a wounded Espin and discovers the assassins are Parasource contractors. Parasource's CEO, General James Harkness (Robert Knepper), sends The Hunter to capture Samantha after a stolen credit card used is tracked. Reacher, Turner, and Espin, acting on information from Prudhomme, intercept a shipment of weapons due to enter the country. There they confront Harkness and his men and accuse them of corruption. However, Espin finds anti-tank weapons as declared in the flight manifest. Before Turner can be taken back to custody, Reacher opens one of the weapons and dumps out bags of pure opium. They learn that Harkness framed Turner, who had been investigating his activities, while the two murdered soldiers had discovered that Harkness was selling weapons to insurgents then smuggling opium into the United States. Espin and his men arrest Harkness. The Hunter and his men chase Samantha through the streets of New Orleans to lure Reacher into a confrontation. One of the assassins is killed by Turner, while the other one is taken out by Reacher. The Hunter captures Samantha on a rooftop, but she manages to escape when Reacher arrives. Reacher and the Hunter have a vicious fight, ending with Reacher breaking The Hunter's arm, leg, and neck, before dumping his body off the rooftop. Following Harkness being arrested, Turner is reinstated to her command. And Reacher promises to keep in touch. Reacher goes to meet Samantha at a diner, telling her that he will recognise her mother when he sees her. It is revealed that Samantha's mother is a waitress at the diner, Reacher knows he cannot be her father, as they did not recognise each other. Reacher and Samantha then reluctantly part. Also starring Jason Douglas as Sheriff, Judd Lormand as Local Deputy, Madalyn Horcher as Sergeant Leach and Jessica Stroup as Lieutenant Sullivan. I agree with critics that Cruise's performance is a rather 50/50 affair, the macho stuff is laughable at times, but his charisma works well. It is slightly predictable setup, a journey to uncover a conspiracy of murder and espionage, and a targeted feisty teenager thrown into the mix, but you cannot help but be carried away by the fast-paced chase and fight sequences, overall it's a fun action thriller. Worth watching!"
" Jack Reacher, His daughter and, Lady Major !
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,6,"Obviously compared to previous one and unfortunately failed to improve than last. Yes this movie is goes a little down than his first part. Though Tom Cruise is perfect in his role , story is okay with action and thrill it looses its impact somehow. It is not sharp as last. Starting and first half is better and creates hope to see a good action drama. But second half trails down and it is being a average climax and end. However lady major is an attractive and lucrative role gives glamorous dose in tension drama mode. To say frankly at least I wish her love making scene with Tom but there were not any shown. It is good and bad too part of this thriller. Tom's daughter story line is beyond my understanding. Was she of him or not very confusing end and god's sake this Reacher franchise dies here, we could not see further parts in future till 2020."
" Disappointment
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,5,"For those of us that gave read all of the Reacher books, this movie is as disappointing as the first. Child dismisses the size difference between Cruise and Reacher in the books. Child has obviously sold out for the money. This is just another Tom Cruise movie with a different character name using the plot of a Child book."
" Why Jack Reacher why
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,3,"Very disappointed with this movie Having just finished the book. Completely different plot settings, characters missing and different locations(New Orleans!!!). Hopefully the upcoming Amazon TV serie will be more authentic to the book series, with Jack Reacher being played by someone is more Jack Reacher than Tom Criuse."
" 2020 perspective: somewhat woke
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,5,"This movie is such a disappointment. The first indicators were that Cobie Smulders was in it. Her best line ""don't patronise me"". Ne'er true words could be said to Hollywood and the people that hired her.Smulders is an unlikeable actress. She's also not a particularly good one. I find myself often drawing parallels with Captain Marvel actress, Brie Larson. However, she was complimented by Danika Yarosh (Samantha) as an unlikeable actress who started to shine by the very end of the movie. I did enjoy the way she related to Cruise (Reacher) in the closing minutes. It showed potential if she can lay off the Smulders juice. However, she did have one good line that I enjoyed. Men that like women don't threaten them. Agreed. But I'd add that men who truly respect women don't patronise them either. I would never patronise a worthy woman. Smulders is not worthy.Sadly, I looked up the new Mission Impossible films (Cruise's other franchise) and they've hired all the wrong female cast. They're going for gold in the Woke Olympics. Those two new movies will collapse under the weight of wokeness.My advice. Be prepared for wokeness when you watch this film. It lacked originality, it lacked solid action (just some shallow fight scenes). It had plenty of identity politics. To Smulder's credit, she actually allowed her character to be hit twice. That's surprising for someone with a fragile ego like hers. Cruise's character often gets beaten up. Maybe, there's a small chance for Smulders in the future.5/10 for a solid effort from some of the cast. Let down by the lack of a credible villain, Smulders and Yarosh and even Cruise wasn't on his A game. If you're bored and this is the only option, you could do worse. Although, i'd pick the original over this. I'd also pick most of the Mission Impossibles before this too."

" Jack Reacher is nothing more than a inferior copy of the Bourne series. Silly, because it is NOT credible!
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,4,"I have tried to like it, really I have, because I really do like Tom Cruise as an actor and I like quite a few of his other action movies, but I never have seen a CREDIBLE LOOKING Jack Reacher movie. It's laughably stupid at moments, while it is meant to be taken seriously!The stench of a bad copy of the Bourne movies (with Matt Damon) can be smelled instantly. Even the soundtrack sounds similar to the Bourne series, but the Bourne credibility is NOWHERE to be found in Jack Reacher.I mean, seriously, this movie is meant to be taken SERIOUSLY. It is NOT meant to be a COMEDY, but it is laughable stupid and unbelievable. I dont get it. Tom Cruise CAN deliver high quality action movies, but these Jack Reacher movies are so terribly WRITTEN that I just get instant headaches.Just to give you 1, only 1 example of serious lack of credibility: 2 highly trained secret intelligence personnel try to break into high security military computers from inside a cafe with an insecure wifi hot spot. Then they act ""surprised"" they cant crack the security of the intelligence agency from within this bar! And their only ""disguise"" inside this cafe is a baseball cap. Yes, a baseball cap, so they wont get recognized, WHILE they are wearing ARMY clothing simultaneously. That's hilariously stupid. Only 6 year old kids wouldnt mind that sort of lack of credibility..."
" What a waste of time
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,3,"Easily the worst Tom cruise film I've ever seen, awful...."
" Not like the book
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,5,"I know this is an old film but I just had to write a review about it. I am a fan of the Reacher books. While the first movie followed the book to some degree. If you read the book and then watch the movie you would not believe it was the same story other than the names of the characters. The Reacher movies in general miss it completely as casting Tom Cruise as Reacher is a huge miss. Lee Child in every book describes Reacher as a blonde guy well over 6 feet and 250 pounds, not Cruise so again if you read the books it is hard to picture Cruise as Reacher. One of the characters in the movie was Sam a young girl. In the movie she was a main character in the book she was more minor. Also in the movie the wound up in New Orleans... they never were there in the book. I could go on but I think you get the point."
" Sadly this film isn't a Jack Reacher film
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,4,"I have been a Jack Reacher fan since book 1 and have every one written. I know intimately who Jack Reacher is just as many of his fans do. And Jack Reacher is not on this film, and this film is not about Jack Reacher.
Make no mistake this film is about Tom Cruise and no-one else. Every mannerism he has, his trademark way of running in every movie he makes. The stunts he loves to do which make it non realistic. The focus is on him, Tom Cruise all of the time and not on the character of Jack Reacher.
As a standalone action film it was OK but just OK, there are much better films out there at the moment. Extraction absolutely overwhelms Never Go Back for sheer entertainment and action and great acting and direction.
One day they will find a Jack Reacher worthy of the name, possibly someone like Thomas Jane, or Dave Bautista. But after 4 years of denying this movie I finally gave in to pressure from friends and watched it and the disappointment is palpable.
A very sad day for movies."
" Jack Is Still Good
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,8,"This second outing for Jack Reacher sees Jack investigating or should I say fighting a suspicious military contractor.
It's a decent action movie with Jack doing what he does best.
A good cast and a good story with plenty of action make this a fast paced action thriller.
Compared to the first movie its equally as good so it's recommended for those who liked the first outing and movies of this genre."
" Tom Cruise wants us to like him.
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,6,"I'm admittedly not a fan of Mr. Cruise but that doesn't mean I refuse to watch his movies. This was a fairly fast paced thriller with the usual nastiness from the villains (if they aren't nasty enough we couldn't cheer on Tom as he beats them to death). My particular objection is the way the movie tries to manipulate my point of view so that I will cheer him on, marvel at his body and generally ''like'' him. Oh yes, Mr. Cruise wants to be liked by all of us and by starring in this sort of movie (which he also produced) he chips away at our objection to his real life antics. Passable movie if you can stomach the inevitable mawkishness."
" Loved the first one
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,5,"Not sure if Cobie Smulders was why this wasn't nearly as good...(she wasn't, but she's terrible)...this one had none of the feel if the first one. It tasted, looked different etc.
It was fine, but easy to never see again. The 1st one was enjoyable for multiple viewings. This was fine."
" A early 2000s-style waste of time
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,2,"This was just another basic action movie with a pathetic story. Tom cruise was good as usual, but the supporting actors all sucked. The woman he ran around with was stupid and arrogant. His daughter was a stupid and obnoxious little feminist who ruined the movie by doing the exact opposite of what she is told to do and puts their lives in jeopardy multiple times (once just to get donuts). It was a Jason Bourne wannabe, and Jason Bourne isn't even that great, making it double suck. The conflict was confusing and the whole movie had me wondering when it would be over"
" Serviceable sequel with some additions that work and some that don't
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,7,"Midway through Jack mentions how he's not used to working with other people and that speaks for the film too, particularly with the addition of Turner-it's a bit of an awkward pairing that often undermines her supposedly strong character (it's still always Jack saving the day). Snarky and smart Sam is a better fit, fortunately (the climactic tie-in was great and yeah, I cried at the embrace). The investigative plot does its job once again, with an engaging fugitive angle added this time around.
6.5/10"
" Nauseating daughter character
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,4,"I really enjoyed the first one. They picked a good novel to make first film. This one.....good frickin night! From the less intriguing story to the more generic bad guys to the, holy crap, god-awful daughter character. She's obnoxious, careless and is never accountable for her constant self-centered actions. Not sure what the makers of this flick were going for as they continued with that character. She's portrayed in a whiny fashion but it's clear we're supposed to view her as an emerging, strong, independent young woman. So if that's not missing the mark in this case I'm not sure what it is.And despite the obvious physical differences that Tom Cruise has in contrast to how the characters in the books I still think he pulled it off in the first film. This one he just seems too ordinary. The fight at the end was something Reacher in the books doesn't experience: a dragged out one. He ends things decisively.But whatever flaws this film has could probably have been looked over without the fingernails-on-chalkboard daughter. I don't care that this is based on a book. Minimize her in a way that her input is more valuable by the less-is-more method. If we were ever supposed to actually feel sorry for her they should do the opposite to make that happen.It's unfortunate that this movie put an end to them making more movies because Jack Reacher books are great story after great story. Maybe they'll actually make it decent with the TV series coming up on Amazon. Here's hoping anyways."
" It's barely ok
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,7,It deserves to be a trilogy when Jack finally settles down for good.
" Really an 8½ but let's review it
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,8,"Well I've become quite a 'Reacher' fan this year, reading a few Lee Child's excellent novels.So of course I've had to take a look at the two movies made so far. 'Reacher' was pretty good, a 7/10 in my book, but I would have to give 'Never Go Back' 8½, which doesn't equate with IMDB, so 8 or 9 will be decided when I post this.I', quite surprised that so many reviewers thought the first movie was better. For me where the second movie excelled was:1 The lead actress was so well portrayed and an excellent foil to Reacher himself.2 Sometimes the first movie's editing was too slow. Headshot scenes were held longer than necessary. This did no happen in 'Never Go Back'.3 Overall, the script and editing were far tighter in 'Never Go Back' and right on track.OK - from a Brit's point of view, the final 5 minutes were typical American 'happy ending' which happens so often. I've made allowances and in this case it was not 'too bad'.I thought the female lead in the second film much better too. Tom Cruise reacted well with her and his 'possible' daughter.I find it quite absurd how many reviewers gripe on about Reacher should be 114 kgs and 198 cms tall (sic). This is a film adaptation, not a facsimile!Hey there Tom - if you want my advice, ditch 'Mission Impossible' series now - and carry on with Reacher, making it even better."
" ""Welcome back to the Army, Major. You're under arrest.""
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,6,"This was pretty good, I enjoyed it more than the first one which I think was mostly down to Cobie Smulders, I liked her and her (kickass) character a lot. She plays Major Susan Turner who gets accused of treason. Tom Cruise works to exonerate her which of course causes the both of them to get tangled up in a conspiracy.I also liked the storyline more this time around with the inclusion of Tom/Jacks ""daughter"" she brings a softness, a humanness to him. Lots of Tom Cruise running (as expected) He and Cobie run together a fair bit, which must have involved some practice for her to to get his pace and unique style. Tom is Tom, which is fine, he gives his all but by now has just become a cliched action hero, nothing we haven't seen from him before.There's a good foot chase scene through the streets of new Orleans and a decent car chase but for the most part the whole movie is predictable and I found myself kinda bored half way through Tom/Jack does some like superheroish things for just a man; punching through car windows to grab bad guys, dumb."
" I know it's a little forced, but this turned kinda 'Twillight-y'
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,6,"Okay, so personally I think Adam Copeland(Edge Rated R) should be Jack Reacher, because well, he is, literally(his physique, his personality, it's a 100% match).I love the Jack Reacher books, but the movies struggle, because the casting it too 'Hollywood', I love Tom Cruise as Ethan Hawke, but I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise playing Ethan Hawke in every movie(which is kind of a problem the last 5 years).Also this movie in the book has a dark-side, in the movie it plays out more like a teen-soap, which is terrible, it makes Jack look like a teen-diva, instead of a troubled-man."
" Another Action Film with Tom
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,4,Some fun and interesting action scenes but overall a bad story and bad film.
" C l i c h é
",2020-01-15 00:00:00,5,"Decent action film, but also predictable, old fashioned for the time, and Cruise's overacting and little manners are getting a bit boring."
" Little disappointing from it's first part
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,6,"Jack Reacher: Never go back is an action thriller movie directed by Edward Zwick and stars Tom Cruise, Cobie Smulders, Aldis Hodge, Danika Yarosh, Holt McCallany and Patrick Heusinger.The movie is the second part of the movie franchise and hope this should be the last one.The Movie starts with perfection and gives the glimpse of its first part but somewhat looses the plot. The director tries to run two three plots but failed.The acting by Cruise is good and so as the rest of the characters. Background music is sometimes too loud, screenplay is complicated.Overall an ordinary movie which could be satisfying for a section of audiences."
" Um... wow...
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,1,I feel a bit sick now.Hope this helps anybody thinking of watching this film.
" better than the 1st one
",2019-11-21 00:00:00,7,I like the Reacher franchise. Thank God I didn't read the books cause every one who did is unhappy with the movies. Tom Cruise has grown on me over the years and I've appreciated his work a little more and this worked for me.
" Standard Tom Cruise film.
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,7,"Lots of action, moderately plausible storyline, although I prefer the series of books.I feel that Tom Hardy would play a better Jack Reacher due to his physical stature being more alike to the character portrayed in Lee Child's books."
" A rare case where a sequel is on par with the first installment
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,7,"Movies such as Jack Reacher should really be a one hit wonder as there typically is no need for a sequel and when movie studios force a sequel out based on the success of the first movie it tends to add pretty badly. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back however is one of only a very select few movies where the sequel matches the quality of its predecessor as Tom Cruise returns to the big screen in a positive way. While some of the story and action scenes were a little cliche and predictable it's to be expected and every so often in the movie the action went from cliche to tremendous. I've never been much of a Tom Cruise fan but he's slowly starting to grow on me and this is just another thumbs up from me for him. While this has been a successful sequel I hope a third isn't in the pipeline as I think that's where the series and character will unravel and get tainted. Quit while you're ahead, please."
" Annoying
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,4,"Anoying dialogues. superficial, artificial. stopped in time, reminiscent of the action movies of the 80s. I had never seen a 16-bullet pistol magazine !! ridiculous. I'm talking about the warehouse scene where the pistol fires 16 consecutive shots."
" Cruise Plays Reacher Again, With Moderate Success
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,7,"As someone who has read every novel written by Lee Child, I am very familiar with the Jack Reacher persona. His is the story of the lone warrior---a stranger who travels alone, who wanders the backroads, righting wrongs when he encounters them. Think ""Kung Fu"" or ""Zatoichi"". And he has a personal code: only use one's skills as a fighter to defend oneself, or others in danger.Another aspect of this benevolent warrior is his nearly-mystical abilities. Zatoichi is blind, but can sense what is around him. The Shaolin monk has trained his mind and body to be impervious and totally in tune with nature and his surroundings. Reacher is in touch with his biorhythms; he always knows the exact time of day and can program himself to sleep whatever interval he chooses.If you did not see the first ""Reacher"" film, the initial scene of ""Never Go Back"" quickly lets you know that this guy (Tom Cruise) is a badass, he has a moral compass, and he is spooky-good at knowing what will happen next. With no prologue, it puts his piece on the board and establishes his strength.Because he can, Reacher decides to travel to Washington, D.C. to meet and thank the woman---Major Turner (Cobie Smulders)---who gave him aid, only to find her in dire circumstances. This is prime territory for Reacher, who immediately knows she is the victim of a conspiracy. The story also places a young girl in his path. She (Danica Yarosh) may be a daughter he was unaware of.Though each woman needs his help, neither is helpless. Major Turner is a tough, adept fighter. The girl, Samantha, has street smarts and knows how to survive. Unfortunately, those who oppose them are professional killers with unlimited resources and political connections.Cruise may not be the Reacher of the novels, but he can play the tough guy, the imperfect hero. Here he brings his usual intensity and physicality. Reacher is part feral cat, part calculating machine, and the script shows some of that. The relationship between the three main characters, which grows out of necessity, is the strength of the story. The fight scenes and chases are well-choreographed, but not inspiring, nor do they have to be. The emphasis, properly, is on the personalities of the three characters who need each other."
" Don't be fooled -- these movies suck.
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,1,"These movies are liked for ONE reason - people read the book before they saw it.I didn't, and can't stand these.Someone told me they were making a new one with a girl, and facepalmed myself because I couldn't believe they would make another."
" Not Nearly As Good As The First Movie
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,5,"I was somewhat disappointed in this movie. It was too predictable, the dialogue wasn't so good, and the direction wasn't great.The first Jack Reacher movie was directed by Christopher McQuarrie who also wrote an excellent screenplay. Edward Zwick simply isn't as good."
" BAD SCRIPT, MANY IDEAS THROWN TOGETHER.
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,5,"So many bad lines, they were trying to make it with so many of the ideas every move about the armed forces are about. Having Cobie Smulders as the tough major that was going to punch Tom Cruise to see who goes search was a joke, noone makes a fist like she did if they know anything about fighting or has any fighting background. This movie is like so many others that the first movie was good so they let the star actor have more say into what happens with the character and it ruins the whole idea. They are actors not writers. Stick with what your good at and leave the other jobs to the professionals that are good at those jobs. You would think studios would have figured it out by now that writers are good at writing stories and actors are good at acting out the story. Stop mixing them up or you will keep having this mess of a movie."
" Better than the novel
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,7,"I watched this film having no expectations and no preconceived ideas at all. I never saw the first movie and had never read Lee Child's series. I am not an action flick fan, but I like a good detective plot. I am not fond of Tom Cruise, but I don't mind him if the story and the characters are interesting. I liked the character he played here, although it is his sidekick Susan Turner that really drew my attention. Cobie Smulders made Major Turner very credible. She is strong and cold-blooded, yet noble and principled. I liked her enough to want to read the novel, which I did afterwards. That was a disappointment. The movie script took the best elements of the book and made it concise and effective, letting go of some unnecessary detours and confrontations. The characters are better developed over all. The relationship between Reacher and Turner is mostly platonic in the film adaptation, which I like. There is a work partner dynamic between them and sometimes, inevitable tension. I was not expecting them to sleep together and to get along so well in the book. Reacher's possible daughter Samantha Dayton has an important role in the film, but only appears for a short while in the book. I believe it was a wise choice to give her a bigger role as Reacher, Turner and Sam make an interesting trio. Not the best film I've seen, and you need to have some basic information about Jack Reacher to know what this story is about at first, but I enjoyed it."
" high action nonsense
",2019-07-11 00:00:00,4,Grrr! Lost my review yet again. In short: the sort of nonsense typical of an action thriller coupled with a semi-plausible plot.
" Stupid and boring Story.
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,4,"This movie is much more boring then the first one. And why they let Cobie ""How i met your mother"" Smulders playing in a movie with Tom Cruise? She not look good and she's a bad actress."
" Not even close to the book
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,4,"I was very disappointed watching this movie. It had so very little in common with the book it takes its title from. Also, 5foot something Tom Cruise is in no way close to being a Jack Reacher"

",2019-06-03 00:00:00,1,I have already reviewed Jack Reacher and everything bad about that one applies here. Please Mr Cruise sell the rights back to the Author so someone can give this character the respect and authenticity he deserves. Its not you and never ever will be. Thanks for ruining the books for me in Cahoots with Mr Child and now I know how GOT fans feel.
" NOT A BOOK!
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,9,"People, please stop comparing this movie to the book. I see that with this movie, and even with movies like lotr. I don't think it makes sense, as you need to critique a movie being a movie, not telling that it's a dissapointment ""because the book was better"". Books don't matter when watching a movie.Yeah, the movie is good."
" A solid, whodunit crime mystery thriller.
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,6,"An almost rhythmic foray of kicks, punches and gunfire provides soundtrack to an action thriller that while hardly original, is delightfully old school cool in its approach to anti-heroes vs baddies."
" A clear step down from the previous entry
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,3,"This is not a very good film. It is filled to the brim with tired cliches (be it plot, dialogue, character progression) that would have been stale even back in the 80s. The inclusion of a bratty kid whom you can count on to screw things up is just the cherry on top.Competently shot and paced but that's about it. The story is so thin and obvious you can see right through it. If there is a third entry I hope the go back to the more focused revenge-type theme.This will go unrecommended from me. Tom and his merry men can do so much better than this 2 hour yawn inducer."
" Not that Bad
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,6,"Firstly no Movie I have ever seen that was based on a book I had read was ever as good as the book, it can't be. When reading a book your own imagination is creating the images, a movie on a TV or cinema cannot compete with your own imagination, well not mine anyway. Next when i heard Tom Cruise was playing Reacher I thought, what, Reacher is 6'5"" but it did not matter in the end. The storyline and plot more or less stayed true to the book and I thought cruise did a good job playing Reacher, no over the top Batman type stuff that some directors may have fallen foul to. The book is a great read the movie not too bad, simple as that, worth a watch imo."
" Jack Reacher: Never Go Back Review
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,10,"When Major Turner (Cobie Smulders), Reacher's (Tom Cruise) successor in the Military Police, is arrested for espionage, he starts poking around. When he's then framed for murder, he busts her out and they set out to clear their names.Sure, he's a fine actor, but what Tom Cruise does really well is run. And Ed Zwick, having directed him before, clearly knows that. So, as Never Go Back approaches the half-hour mark and with Cruise yet to break into anything above a brisk walk, Zwick cuts to him sprinting for a cab. And then, to make up for lost time presumably, a few minutes later he runs for a bus. He may be 54 now (and it's not quite him trying to outrun a sandstorm), but watching Cruise run has lost none of its thrill.Of course that is, technically, another stick with which doubters can beat this cinematic Reacher, should they be so inclined. Book Reacher's lumbering lack of speed is a rare weakness and is brought up semi-regularly, but clearly it's not an issue here. (Even though he does miss that bus.) But it feels, two movies in, as though it's time to make peace. For better or worse, taller or shorter, when it comes to cinematic Reacher, Cruise is our man.
And (despite all that running) there is good news. Zwick here takes Reacher closer to the books - tougher, gruffer and no longer boasting the skills of a stunt-car driver. (At least, not that we're shown.) In fact, he's usually in the passenger seat. The opening scene, which sees police arrive at a diner with four bodies writhing in agony on the car park floor, and Reacher calmly sitting inside drinking his coffee, is a perfect example - an Indiana Jones-style end-of-the-last-adventure vignette that immediately sets the scene for this grittier vision. We're not in the same territory in terms of stylistic differences as Mission: Impossible and its immediate sequel - there are no slo-mo doves here - but it's still a noticeably different beast.The stakes are higher here than in Jack Reacher - he's framed for murder after poking around in the arrest of Turner (Smulders), the major who's doing his old job in the Military Police. She's been accused of espionage, but Reacher senses something's afoot (which his arrest proves), so he breaks them both out of prison and they go on the run, closely followed by hitmen determined to stop them. Plus there's an added wrinkle: 15-year-old Samantha (Danika Yarosh), a girl Reacher's only just found out about, who may or may not be his daughter, is also caught in the firing line. Cue familial-style bickering between the three.
According to Lee Child, the presence of Samantha in Never Go Back is one of the main reasons this story was chosen, and it's an interesting addition in terms of Reacher's character development - will the drifter find an anchor? Sure, it took 18 books of wandering for this particular paternity issue to come up and we're only on film two, but it's not without precedent - the issue of settling down was raised as early as book three when Reacher inherited a house (he decided against it).Reacher's also drafted back into the army after a clause in his release papers is activated, allowing them (rather than the police) to hold him for the murder he's accused of. This sets up some soul-searching about whether someone like him can ever have a normal life, and brings up the question about why he left in the first place. ""Let's just say, I woke one morning and the uniform didn't fit,"" he tells Turner.
But where Never Goes Back does fall short in comparison with Jack Reacher, despite the lower stakes, is the central mystery. One Shot, the book the first film is based on, boasted one of the best (if not the best) of the entire series. Never Go Back does not. Recognising that, much here has been changed from the source material. Some necessary (the book fizzles out whereas this builds to a final showdown), some just different - no LA, as soon as the trio leave DC they head to party town New Orleans, where the finale just happens to coincide with the annual Hallowe'en parade. But the murky machinations of the arms-dealing still can't compete with the purity of the original's sniper mystery. Next time it would be wise to choose one of the better-plotted books - Killing Floor or Bad Luck And Trouble perhaps.And it looks likely there will be a next time. This is only the second instance where Tom Cruise has committed to a sequel, and presumably it's with eyes on a long-running franchise. With M:I it took him three movies to nail the tone and formula; with Reacher he's managed it a film earlier."

Of course that is, technically, another stick with which doubters can beat this cinematic Reacher, should they be so inclined. Book Reacher's lumbering lack of speed is a rare weakness and is brought up semi-regularly, but clearly it's not an issue here. (Even though he does miss that bus.) But it feels, two movies in, as though it's time to make peace. For better or worse, taller or shorter, when it comes to cinematic Reacher, Cruise is our man.
And (despite all that running) there is good news. Zwick here takes Reacher closer to the books - tougher, gruffer and no longer boasting the skills of a stunt-car driver. (At least, not that we're shown.) In fact, he's usually in the passenger seat. The opening scene, which sees police arrive at a diner with four bodies writhing in agony on the car park floor, and Reacher calmly sitting inside drinking his coffee, is a perfect example - an Indiana Jones-style end-of-the-last-adventure vignette that immediately sets the scene for this grittier vision. We're not in the same territory in terms of stylistic differences as Mission: Impossible and its immediate sequel - there are no slo-mo doves here - but it's still a noticeably different beast.
The stakes are higher here than in Jack Reacher - he's framed for murder after poking around in the arrest of Turner (Smulders), the major who's doing his old job in the Military Police. She's been accused of espionage, but Reacher senses something's afoot (which his arrest proves), so he breaks them both out of prison and they go on the run, closely followed by hitmen determined to stop them. Plus there's an added wrinkle: 15-year-old Samantha (Danika Yarosh), a girl Reacher's only just found out about, who may or may not be his daughter, is also caught in the firing line. Cue familial-style bickering between the three.
According to Lee Child, the presence of Samantha in Never Go Back is one of the main reasons this story was chosen, and it's an interesting addition in terms of Reacher's character development - will the drifter find an anchor? Sure, it took 18 books of wandering for this particular paternity issue to come up and we're only on film two, but it's not without precedent - the issue of settling down was raised as early as book three when Reacher inherited a house (he decided against it).
Reacher's also drafted back into the army after a clause in his release papers is activated, allowing them (rather than the police) to hold him for the murder he's accused of. This sets up some soul-searching about whether someone like him can ever have a normal life, and brings up the question about why he left in the first place. ""Let's just say, I woke one morning and the uniform didn't fit,"" he tells Turner.
But where Never Goes Back does fall short in comparison with Jack Reacher, despite the lower stakes, is the central mystery. One Shot, the book the first film is based on, boasted one of the best (if not the best) of the entire series. Never Go Back does not. Recognising that, much here has been changed from the source material. Some necessary (the book fizzles out whereas this builds to a final showdown), some just different - no LA, as soon as the trio leave DC they head to party town New Orleans, where the finale just happens to coincide with the annual Hallowe'en parade. But the murky machinations of the arms-dealing still can't compete with the purity of the original's sniper mystery. Next time it would be wise to choose one of the better-plotted books - Killing Floor or Bad Luck And Trouble perhaps.
And it looks likely there will be a next time. This is only the second instance where Tom Cruise has committed to a sequel, and presumably it's with eyes on a long-running franchise. With M:I it took him three movies to nail the tone and formula; with Reacher he's managed it a film earlier."
" A film series that I will not likely return to.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,5,"The follow-up sequel to Jack Reacher (2012), Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016) is almost a warning to the audience in the title alone. I understand how a long-running book series like the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child is advantageous for the author by allowing the reader to pick up any book in the series and not need the background of the previous titles. However, with these self-encapsulated scenarios, Jack Reacher is probably better aligned with a television series than a series of movies. Not everyone can be the James Bond series, which has been able to get away with this for as long as it has.Don't get me wrong, I liked the original Jack Reacher movie, as it seemed to channel the ""man with no name"" / high-plains drifter / Ronin style that was prevalent in Westerns and Samurai films. His skills and calm demeanor unquestionably imply military training, but now that Never Go Back has returned them to those roots, it feels less impactful. Sure, there's still the requisite fight sequences and car chases, but they just feel like the standard checklist trappings of an action film instead of an exceptional experience.Having read the first book in the Jack Reacher series, I also have some problems with how the movie's portrayal of the main character. The first movie did OK in creating this mythical man who always seemed to know what to do and where to go (somewhat along the lines of John Wick (2014)). This movie seemed to add in so many side plots and distractions that I never quite knew what Reacher (Tom Cruise) was going to handle next. Perhaps the dissociation between the book and movie versions of the character also has to do with trying to maintain a PG-13 rating for a character who clearly does R-rated things.A film series that I will not likely return to, I give Jack Reacher: Never Go Back 2.5 stars out of 5."

" PC and cliché

It doesn't matter that she weighs maybe 90 pounds soaking wet, our girls need a roll model. This movie adds the cliché daughter who wants nothing to do with her dad and whose sole purpose in the film is to constantly create problems and get into trouble making it that much more amazing when Jack Reacher completes his mission. Skip this one."
" A disappointing sequel
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,6,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is unfortunately a disappointing sequel that's extremely generic and predictable with serviceable performances from everyone apart from Tom Cruise, who gives a reliably committed performance. A few enjoyable and well filmed action sequences and the good pace make it worth watching but it's nowhere near as good as the first."
" Worhwhile to watch
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,8,"Not as good as mission impossible series. Still Tom Cruise has his attractiveness. The story has some interesting line in that he has a possible daughter, and has to defend her to be killed by hus enemies. The interaction on him with a 15 years old girl is new in his movie. Eventually that girl is not his daughter. Still he give a big hug to her upon leaving. That part is passionate.I have no compaint on female lead.On the whole a movie worthwhile to watch."

It could almost pass for a made-for-tv film... actually if you take Cruise out of it I'm pretty sure it would pass that test.If you're like me you're used to Cruise movies being at a bare minimum entertaining and with good action... this had neither.Can't put my finger on what made it bad - many of the necessary ingredients for a good movie were there: good cast... check, good director... check, budget... check. Cruise is fine. But it seems nobody really wanted to make this movie and almost everyone else is mailing it in.Suggest re-watching the original and forget this one even exists."

The conversation shifts back to Jack, saying it ""wasn't his finest moment, and when it switches back to her, she's wearing her dress uniform again! Oops!! lol between minute 6-7 of the movie."

" Reacher as a midget.
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,5,"I've read every Jack Reacher book and love the character. Reacher is 6ft 5 and built like a Mac truck. His immense size and imposing presence along with his combat skills make him a unique fighting force, one who is rarely bested and never in a 1 on 1 contest. To see a 5ft 6 Jack Reacher get thrown around like a rag doll in a fight makes me want to cry.
Tom Cruise might be a good Ethan Hunt, but he is no Jack Reacher."

Maybe he's just getting old and needs the paycheck."

I don't know if this is how it's written in the books but if so- then I'm glad I haven't read them.Action and plot? Meh. Really basic and ""bleh"".I really wish Tom Cruise would stop trying to play people over 5'8, he's convicting nobody."

" A top notch, fun action thriller.
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,10,"JACK REACHER was an intelligent action thriller which treated me to multiple surprising twists and exhilarating, white knuckle action sequences.JACK REACHER: NEVER GO BACK does the same, but in a different way.The first one was more about the case than anything else. This one isn't just about another case Reacher has taken up; it's also about the emotional bond between the characters which has portrayed brilliantly without pushing the fil, into an excessively dramatic zone.NEVER GO BACK is an out and out action thriller just like the first one. There are plenty of solid fistfights, running, explosions, gunplay and everything you expect in a Tom Cruise action entertainer. He has undoubtedly done a great job as always. This time, it's not just about him and thus other characters too get to breathe. Cobie Smulders is impressive as the action hero, Turner. Rest of the cast has delivered very strong performances as well.The screenplay is not very complex and at times you might even get the feel of watching a family story unfold. This film isn't as complex as the first one but that makes it different from the first one instead of an imitation. Editing is sharp.In short, Reacher is there at your service if you want a fun action movie with a lot of excellent action sequences, some great twists and characters worth remembering."
" Another Jack Reacher..
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,7,I will keep this review short. These are my thoughts on Tom Cruise's revival as Jack....Jack Reacharound: Never Go Backdoor
" Tom Cruise Is No Jack Reacher
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,2,"Can only assume that as Tom Cruise was the producer, must have given Lee Child quite the handout to cast him as Jack Reacher. Sorry, but Tom Cruise just cannot convince the viewer who has been a fan of Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels that he can be Jack Reacher. The film itself is noth8ng special, just filled with too much special effects, detracting from the storyline.
Let's just hope Tom Cruise does not undertake another Jack Reacher role."
" Read the book ""never go back""
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,2,"I have like millions of Lee Child fans read the Reacher books.
Did anyone of the script writers, casting directors or anyone involved in this movie read the books.
The character of Reacher is very precise.
Tom cruise is an exceptional movie star, but not for this character.
Read the book and then tell me, where this movie relates in anyway to the Reacher character."
" Solid Thriller...
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,8,"I felt this film was better than the first. Appreciated the presence of a strong female character in Cobie Smulders. Helped offset Tom Cruise who I still can't quite see as Reacher from the books. However, I thought this was better than the first film and enjoyed the pace and way in which the plot unfolded. The acting is strong. Worth a watch, I enjoyed it."
" Cliched
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,4,"Some good action but a typical All American Hero Saves The Planet film. Lots of sentiment, you can predict what is going to happen in this dime a dozen movie."
" An OK action film
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,7,"OK, the diminutive Tom Cruise can never really be Jack Reacher, who is a very large man. There are certainly medium-sized badasses, but Reacher's size sets him apart. But none of that really matters. Movies made from novels rarely follow them very well, in plot or casting, and aren't necessarily meant to. I don't think I've seen one truly follow the source novel since Interview With the Vampire. But this one is an OK action film. Yes, sure, some plot holes, and people in movies fights always take punishing blows, yet have no pain ten minutes later. I don't care much for Cruise, but I have to admit that he has that movie star charisma. Cobie Smulders was great within the limits of her role, and I hope to see more of her."
" Where's the Action?
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,4,"(Flash Review)Another shallow, rather bland and fluffy Hollywood action movie. This story is filled with false accusations, government cover ups and espionage. Oh and throw in a teenage girl for good measure. A more detailed plot description won't matter here as it is so forgettable it will flutter away like a butterfly from memory an hour later. And yep, you guessed it, Jack gets captured and proceeds to calmly tells his captors how he'll escape and he promptly eludes their clutches. One would think with a saggy script certainly there must be great action right? Incorrect. You'd hope the action scenes were at least exciting but to my surprise they were below expectations and few and few and far between. This could have been a clever advertisement for teeth whitening or hair product as Cruise always looks like Cruise. Bad plot. Not enough action. Yawn."
" Uh this is the worst movie??
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,1,"Look I've seen lots of movies. At the end of the day, I'm pretty easily entertained. But this movie is a piece of garbage. I'm not sure of Jack Reacher's origins, but Tom Cruise's rendition comes off as a low rent version of Ian Hunt (mission impossible series). The startling lack of chemistry between him and that Robin girl is hokey enough but that wretched character of daughter-not daughter brat is enough to make one want to lose their lunch. Filled with cheesy lines and copied and pasted villains, this is one of the few movies I am going out of my way to say is not worth your time."
" so and so, better than the first
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,5,"The story is pretty stupid and tame with lots of logical errors or unlikely twists and reactions. Tom Cruise is as one-dimensional as ever in Action mode. Suspense is not killing us, just mildly entertaining if, and only if, we accept the thin premises the story is built on.Still it's actually more watchable than the first Jack Reacher movie. Don't waste your time on either of them, unless you must see Tom in all his movies."
" Few surprises here ... except maybe in the above-average character interplay
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,7,"This review comes from someone who has jumped straight to the second film, without ever seeing the first. In this ""Never Go Back"" instalment, Director Edward Zwick brings Tom Cruise back as Reacher - this time as an ""ex-military"" version of the hero penned into existence by British (no not American) writer Lee Child (who neatly takes a minor role in the movie!) And this work adds further weight to the idea that ""ex-military"" mostly seems a bit of a contradiction in terms (just like ""ex-CIA"", for that matter). Indeed, its ""ex military"" that Reacher is now also up against, given that our enemies here are those chief bogeymen since the 1990s - private defence/security contractors. You know, the people that Eisenhower warned us about in 1961, the people working in businesses of the kind that enriched a former Vice President of the USA, the people that Harvard's Prof. Michael Sandel likes to home in on when he asks: when did the American people ever give permission for their wars to be fought - or at least mopped up - by the private sector? Those kinds of people.Anyway, there's plenty of whizz-bang stuff here, violence aplenty with ""crunchy"" sound effects (yes, really), and none of it looks especially real-life, or indeed worthwhile, except maybe to keep us on our toes in wondering what those private-sector military are up to, on their own, or when they hook up with the military proper. This chunk of the wider military-industrial complex is not pretty, as it's portrayed here as black ops, devious, with fingers in every pie, casual about human life, keen to make money at all costs, and so on.So no real surprises there...Indeed, one might pretty much say that's all there is to the rather unoriginal work that is ""Never Go Back"" ... and bye-bye. This is not quite so, however, given the dynamics and interest of a kind of ""impromptu family on the run in a road movie gone wrong"" that appears for much of the film, thanks to a deliciously hot Cobie Smulders as Major Turner, Reacher himself, and sassy teen Samantha played by Danika Yarosh. Cruise is more or less his usual character here (love it or hate it, I mostly love it), but Smulders is classy and plays a more-than-one-dimensional role, while Yarosh is far, far better than we have any right to expect. Indeed, the extremely patient viewer rounded enough to be interested in various aspects of this movie beyond the ""bangs for the bucks"" will have a fine cinematic treat in store with a final scene played out between Yarosh and Cruise. So genuine and well done (and touchingly thought-provoking) is this that it delivered the tears to my (father-of-a daughter) eyes within moments, and it also segued beautifully into some touching music from British composer Henry Jackman. Now what to say about a film that scores best where you don't expect it, and is best of all in its - entirely untypical - last 3 minutes? For this reason, enigmatic to say the least, I've gone for a 7 here. Call me crazy if you will..."
" Solid action with a somewhat cliché story
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,7,"In the prologue we see protagonist Jack Reacher arrested; it turns out he was working with Major Susan Turner of the Military Police to arrest the corrupt sheriff who had just arrested him. Sometime after this he goes to Washington DC to see her and learns that she has been arrested for alleged espionage. He goes to see her lawyer and is told that she specifically said not to let him get involved... she doesn't want anything to do with a 'deadbeat dad'; something that comes as a surprise to Reacher as he has no children and doesn't know the woman who had claimed he was the father of her fifteen year old daughter Samantha. Soon afterwards the lawyer is murdered and Reacher is blamed. He is convinced that those behind the murder with be after Major Turner next so he breaks her out of military prison before collecting his 'daughter' who is being targeted to get at him. Together Reacher and Turner must discover how their situation is connected to the murders of two US Military Police personnel in Afghanistan and a shadowy military contractor. This will lead them to New Orleans where the truth will be exposed and the villains faced.If you are looking for plenty of action then this will is well worth watching; there are fights, gunfights, chases and explosions every few minutes. These are well executed and make it relatively easy to overlook the fairly cliché plot. We have protagonists accused of a crime they didn't commit; a child who needs protecting who does things that put her in danger; a dodgy mercenary group and a motive that will seem obvious to viewers but isn't mentioned by the protagonists till the reveal scene. Tom Cruise does a fine job as Jack Reacher; not too surprising as it is the sort of role he excels in. Cobie Smulders and Danika Yarosh are solid enough as Turner and Samantha even if their characters are mainly there for Reacher to save. Patrick Heusinger is suitable menacing as the main bad guy even if his character does descend into pantomime villain territory towards the end. Overall a fun enough action film that won't test the brain cells too much!"
" Wrong Direction
",2018-06-25 00:00:00,6,"Never Go Back, indeed. I'm reviewing this long after seeing it in the theater and I haven't seen it since despite its availability on Netflix, Hulu, Prime. The disappointment I felt then is still palpable today, especially after recently re-watching the first film.There is little difference between the first and second films in terms of production level, casting, story line, etc. Yet it's the collective of many small differences and attention to detail that makes one film great and the other a dud. I gave this one a 6 because it satisfies fundamental aspects of an action film, and those who rated the sequel higher than 6 or liked it, consistently to gravitated to that point. However, the first film more than satisfies all that too, but then outshines the sequel in every other way, making it a complete film in my opinion. This sequel falls flat in all those other aspects.I think this film suffers very specifically from two problems - its comparison to the first film and its director. McQuarrie, who directed the first, is known more for his writing resume and has limited directing time, yet seems to understand the concept of satisfying action film fans while maintaining the continuity of a good overall film. Despite his short director resume, he has been consistent in action films.In contrast, Zwick, who directed the sequel, has an Oscar-sprinkled director resume, but is known for drama epics. It seems clear to me that there was a shortsighted agenda by producers to change the direction of the feel, politics, rhetoric or something, but it was a bad idea. Jason Bourne, which came out the same year, had the same problem even though is had the same director as previous sequels. That's why I think it is an agenda thing from the producers.Sequels tend to not be as good as the first, but usually because producers shamefully try to maximize capitalization on the success of the first film by skimping on big details like the director, the script and top actors in the followup film. However, Zwick and Greengrass wouldn't be cheap, plus top actors are still there and production levels alone keep the budgets high. Yet the first films in Reacher and Bourne still stand out so much more. Why? Attention to detail. Like a band's first album - they simply seemed to be trying to nail the small details in addition to the big ones.Producers of Reacher and Bourne either don't understand why the first films were good, or don't care. I lean toward the latter. They only want your money and their agenda pushed. They don't care about longevity. Dollars can be found in the next fad.Many reviewers have pointed out some of these flaws with the second film that were not in the first, or not as bad. Forced dialogue, implausible action scenes, all the good scenes in the trailer, hokey drama, flat/weak characters, cliche settings, and so on. I'll add these to it: The opening sequence was the only part of the sequel that seemed like the first film. I think that was strategic. If some people knew better, they'd never had gone in the first place. Next, Cruise didn't seem interested the entire film. He appeared to be going though the motions in many scenes, while he seemed to relish in the character of the first film. Smulders should've been a perfect fit for her role, yet her performance wasn't half as good as Rosamund Pike in the first film. Outside of Cruise and Smulders, there were no other memorable performances or characters. The first film had dozens of well-thought out and well-performed characters. Every actor was fitting and at least up to par in the first Reacher. I think its worst performance was the local detective, and he at least did okay. No other secondary role in the sequel reached his level. There was NOBODY like Jenkins, Courtney, Herzog or Duvall in the 2nd film and these were big names playing secondary roles in the first Reacher. But even the next level roles like the supposed gunman, the thugs at the bar and the victims on the river were well-played and fitting compared to just about everyone in the sequel. Even the brief scene by the auto store manager in the first film was better performed and more memorable than the roles of the entire sequel.Finally, the action scenes in both films can be criticized as unrealistic, and the final fight scene in the first film was one of the few things I didn't like in that one. But at least everything in the first film was plausible compared to the sequel. As one reviewer noted, the sequel stepped back into the cliches of the 90s for much of the action scenes. Maybe Zwick didn't know any better and they rushed through the details believing or hoping it would pass, just like the recent Jason Bourne film. It's as if they believe most people are dumb enough to believe some very stupid things (like remotely accessing CCTV cameras). Maybe people are that naive or simply that eager for ANY entertainment, but the IMDB ratings at least slightly show otherwise. If the direction of Reacher continues this way, I won't even consider going to the next one. I'd need some significant reassurances."
" Entertaining action.
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,8,"This movie is everything you expect it to be. The story is not bad and keeps you awake. Generally the acting is pretty good. However some of the fight scenes are ""a tad ridiculous"" as in reality punishment like this would result in multiple broken bones and ruptured internal organs. Would we watch it again, absolutely. Retained for future viewing."
" Average action thriller
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,"Jack Reacher, loner ex-Military Police officer, visits Major Turner, a female officer he only knows from telephone calls, and finds she has been arrested. Reacher finds himself involved in uncovering - and being implicated in - a conspiracy: he and Turner go on the run. To add complication, they are saddled with a teenage girl who may or may not be Reacher's daughter.Tom Cruise plays Reacher in a second adaptation (out of order) of one of Lee Child's novels. The first one had an element of novelty to it - Reacher is an entertaining character, a principled loner, gifted at giving and taking a thumping, a good and dogged detective, and with a tendency towards pithy rejoinders - but that novelty is not present in a second offering. What is left is an action thriller with a plot which is effective, but which isn't going to surprise anyone who has watched more than half a dozen action thrillers in their life.Having said that, it is perfectly satisfactory as a basis for the suspense, chases, shoot-'em-up and beat-'em-up sequences which populate this movie. The trouble is that it all feels a bit generic - it's satisfactory entertainment while you're watching it, but there's an air of déjà vu to it.Cobie Smulders should have an underwear scene written into every film she appears in, as a point of international law.Cruise seldom offers less than value for money in terms of performance, and he is joined by Cobie Smulders as Turner, a women with nearly as much attitude and physicality as Reacher, Danika Yarosh as Samantha, Reacher's maybe/maybe-not daughter, plays her well, but the character is not very sympathetically written, and is hard to like. The villains are a mixture: some may as well have ""villain"" tattooed on their forehead. None is as memorable as Werner Herzog or Jai Courtney in the previous film.The action sequences are entertaining but, again, none is exceptional, and none matches the bathroom fight from Reacher's initial outing.If you enjoyed the first film then you are likely to enjoy this one, but you may feel slightly let down by a film which entertains but has nothing out of the ordinary about it."
" It does not deserve bad reviews
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,8,"The first Jack Reacher might have had more grey cells. The second one is fast
paced and with a huge relief, no bad language and no inappropriate scenes An old school action movie with good casting. One might have had very high expectations
since Edward Zwick being the Director and might have looked forward to something like The Last Samurai and Blood Diamond. Though it did not match
up to that level, it was neither disappointing. I was very apprehensive to know

",2018-05-13 00:00:00,3,Not great! Biggest surprise was the Unsatisfying final fight. Be ready to roll your eyes at the stupid STEREOTYPICAL McDRUG DRUG DEN re-creation. Jack Preacher original film was 2x better. You can tell this movie had a budget and a deadline. Never to be viewed again. Adios Jack Reacher.
" Weak Effort
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,5,There's just not much good you can say about this movie. Dialogue is forced...action scenes pretty poor and a general waste of time. I like Tom Cruise but he looks and seems too old for this role. First Reacher was better for what that's worth.
" 90's action, soft based storyline
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,6,"The introduction of Jack Reacher (2012) which garnered wide box office success looked as if it would be a good character to get invested in. While I did enjoy the context of the first film I expected more from the second. The content of the story is often way overplayed in films and this does not do any justice to the development of the character. There is a very 90's cinematic action feel to the plot. In my honest opinion the way Reacher just freely moved around military facilities was generic at best. The fight sequences while plausible seemed very telegraphed and not visual enough. Cruise projected the toughness and arrogance he has made this character to be very well. I thought Cobie Smulders did a fantastic job as Major Turner, feisty, direct, strong, independent and just how a woman should be portrayed.We have seen these style storylines developed over the years and they always have the same outcome. I felt there could have been more done with the characters in this film and the dialogue and direction was reaching at times.Overall I would give this a 6 out of 10 for me. Not a great film by aby means but is a nice filler for an afternoon. I do hope they stop with this sequel and do not try for a third."
" Lower rating 2nd time viewed, gave it 8 1st time
",2018-04-19 00:00:00,5,"I saw this in the theater and enjoyed it since I'm a fan of Lee Child's books. Seeing this again on DVD, I see a few errors I don't like. Tom is in another fight being surrounded by thugs and he beats them all. Just rush in and beat his a**, don't do it one-at-a-time! Same as in the 1st Reacher film. Same as in the Samurai film. The fights I felt were poorly choreographed. Huge hard punches but no bruises or blood. Tom/Jack got 'whupped' on the roof in the final fight but no blood or visible bruises on his face after 2 vicious punches and 1 kick. ""C'mon, Gimme A Break!"" A little more real please. Too bad Jason Statham wasn't chosen for this. He would have been 100% better and the right physical size too."
" Tom Snooooooooze...please stop with these shallow egotistical action hero crap films
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,3,"I suggest Tom Snooze read his own movie title and ""Never Go Back"". How can anyone take a 140 pound five foot seven inch middle aged actor serious as a one man wrecking crew?Tom, I suggest you leave the action genre to guys like Dwayne Johnson, John Cena, Dave Bautista, and even legitimate senior citizens like Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren who are more believable.Hey Tom, I got an idea for your comeback! Why don't you try and make a sequel to your now 35 year old 1983 film Risky Business and call the sequel ""Old Time Rock and Roll"". I am quite sure all your (now) loyal grandmother fans who watched you 35 years ago prance around in your underwear singing karaoke Bob Seger's Old Time Rock and Roll would get even a bigger laugh seeing you do that again than watching you pretend to be a middle aged badass action hero.I give this sequel a lowly 3 out of 10 rating and please Tom Snooooooze, ""Never Go Back"" to the action genre again."
" Wow. That was lame.

" Woeful story and cringingly bad dialogue
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,5,"This has Tom Cruise in. So it gets some stars by default. But this film is so bad. Which is a pity because the first one was watchable. The story was written by a four year old who was adamant that you were going to know the plot. It is so clumsy and idiotic. If you are just coming out of a coma then this is for you. If you have trouble understanding stories then you will love this. If you enjoy highly predictable storylines and non-sensical decision making then... yes, you know what I am getting at. Not recommended."
" well-defined mediocrity
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,5,"Don't get me wrong, I get it why some people think this movie is amazing. When I was 18, Jean-Claude van Damme movies pressed all the right buttons for me, too. But if you have watched so many movies as I did, I can hardly find anything going for this movie. 
It is well executed, highly professional, it has no rough edges, only smooth curves, it has extremely high production values, actors who know what they are doing and the movie is amazingly boring. 
Nothing in there which I did not see 100 times already, the plot is as average as it can get. I don't know, but if there would be something imperfect about this movie, I might maybe be somehow able to get some joy out of it, but this is a higly polished granite, which could easily be a diamond if the filmmakers were willing to take at least the slightest bit of risk. Well, if you want to nitpick, I could not really believe that Tom Cruise is the super agent, the whole daughter thing felt tacked on and Cobie Smulders does not strike me as a military type (a role that was much, much better filled by Demi Moore in ""a few good men"") I don't know if it is me or if Hollywood has lost it, but I most certainly can find more enjoyment out of the older Cruise movies. 5 Stars out of 10 from me for the ultimate non-risk boringness"
" Ruined by lazy scripting
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,3,"First off the bat, I've never read a Jack Reacher novel and couldn't care less whether or not Tom Cruise looks like the bloke in the book. I enjoyed the first movie and thought it had an effective raw quality. Never Go Back, however, is a travesty. I won't divulge any spoilers, but I will highlight two main deficiencies.Firstly, plausibility is stretched to breaking point in this movie. Astonishingly incompetent law enforcement officers, plot inconsistencies (e.g. Reacher steals an ID card to get a flight, but his two co-fugitives don't seem to need one) and infuriating character decisions. Here's a tip - if you're being pursued by ruthless killers and you find a good place to hide, STAY THERE AND CALL THE POLICE FROM YOUR PHONE! Do not continually creep out of your safe spot to be pursued by said killers.The second major problem is the decision to bring in Samantha (Danika Yarosh), who may or may not be Reacher's daughter. Coupled with Cobie Smulders, are they trying to infer that Reacher is longing for the quiet family life? Possibly, but that dynamic is never fully explored, Ed Zwick instead recycling the same punch-ups, car-jackings and vintage Cruise sprints for most of the two-hour running time.Overall, Jack Reacher 2 is hampered by ludicrous set-pieces and character decisions that will have you howling, ""That would NEVER happen"" at the screen. It's impossible to engage with the story when it's crammed full of every conceivable Hollywood trope.Cruise should have heeded the strapline and never gone back for this sequel. Avoid."
" Where does loyalty dwell
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,6,"Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) has been on the run four years, but still enforcing his brand of justice where and when he sees it fits. Reacher off and on keeps in touch with headquarters and Major Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders), who now heads his old investigative unit. When he discovers she has been arrested for espionage, Reacher will break her out of prison in order to prove her innocence. At the same time, he works relentlessly to bust wide open a major government conspiracy that should clear himself of a murder for which he was framed. Also in the cast: Aldis Hodge, Danika Yarosh, Holt McCallany, Robert Knepper, Madalyn Horcher and Patrick Heusinger."
" Cruise's that other action series isn't bad at all
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,7,"How the heck can a man in his fifties stay constantly in such a good shape and fit for starring in physically demanding action movies? Those who know, don't tell but show - including Tom Cruise who keeps currently not one but two franchises active.The sixth ""Mission: Impossible"" will arrive in July. The second ""Jack Reacher"" reviewed here didn't have much of a box office success - even the first one was struggling, actually. Here's hoping there will come a third one, because I fnd this honestly quite entertaining.It's a little hard to figure out the aim of Jack Reacher series. It's a typical action movie but then again, it's not typical at all. The makers throw out much of the usual genre filler - including on-screen romances, explanations about the world the intriguing character operates in, light humor etc.The emphasis is on tempo and suspense, building and holding of it, and somehow, somewhy, this lean mean approach works, even without spectacular setpieces of ""Mission: Impossible"". At least it works for me.Of course, the Cruiser fancies himself an event actor and larger than life, so every movie starring him must have its fair share of ""Cruise moments"" - mostly shots of him standing, smiling and lurking around in specific way that is instantly recognizable for anyone who has seen his most famous works.""Never Goes Back"" has a good amount of them, especially in the final third. So if you don't stomach or care about Cruise wearing his Cruise-ness loudly and proudly, you will probably have some hard time with enjoying the result.There seems to be even less room for plot development than in the first movie, but they still have time to bring in two intriguing female characters to go alongside the Cruiser.This gives otherwise action-centric movie a short but moving finale, full of Cruise shots, of course, but still. And it gives hope to see him again and learn about him as character, not just the man who comes and kicks ass. I for one would like that."
" Jack Reacher doesn't like being followed..
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,5,"When Jack Reacher learns that one of his former colleagues Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders) has been arrested for espionage Reacher takes it upon himself to rescue Turner (despite her advising him against doing this). It turns out that there is a wider conspiracy involving a company called Para-Source and Reacher and Turner must get to the bottom of who Para-Source are and why they want Turner dead? Matters are further complicated when Reacher finds himself with some rather unexpected baggage...I enjoyed the first Jack Reacher film (in spite of the fact that it offered very little that I hadn't seen before). It was fast-paced, entertaining whilst also offering a fairly decent storyline. I really wanted to like the sequel, but just couldn't quite warm to it in the same way that I could with the first film...Part of the problem with this sequel lies with the story and no matter how much it tries it simply isn't as involving or engaging as it was in the first film. Despite the fact that this film runs slightly shorter than the original it actually felt much longer. The original film suffered slightly with poor character development and underdeveloped villains. This film has the same problems only they are worse in this sequel. Robert Knepper is on villain duties as normal, but he's only featured in a couple of scenes and isn't given the opportunity to make any real impression on the picture. The story is also a little weak and if I'm totally honest a little uninteresting. In this sequel, Reacher also discovers that he may have a daughter and finds himself having to protect the girl who he believes may be his daughter as well as exposing the truth about Para-Source. I presume that the potential 'daughter' may have been introduced to show a different side to Reacher and perhaps to give him a back story, but truth be told it didn't feel entirely necessary and in all honesty it's a strand of the story that I didn't much care for.Having said all that, the film isn't all bad and does still have some impressive action sequences and some of the chase scenes towards the end are moderately exciting and entertaining. However, as I've said the story is weak and uninvolving, the supporting cast don't make much of an impression leaving the action sequences being the only thing worth watching in this film.One other thing; how did the hit-man manage to get to New Orleans before Reacher and Co when they left for New Orleans before him? Unless Para-Source are sending their hit-men by private jet in order to carry out their hits? Yes it's sloppy, largely uninvolving and weak in comparison to the first film. However, when the focus is on the action then it rarely disappoints. It's not great, but it's just about watchable I suppose."
" NO, not Reacher!
",2018-01-19 00:00:00,5,"I will not accept TC as Reacher. He took WAY to much punishment and too long to dispatch bad guys. This should have been someone like THE ROCK, and someone who could flex something besides his cheeks. TC is now too old and too small for this part. 4 stars because of the skill of the ladies, not for Tommy."
" love the books, this movie is really bad
",2018-01-11 00:00:00,1,"Tom Cruise at 5'10"" is no Jack Reacher. The movie doesn't follow the book and it's all the worse for it. The worst part was at approx. the 30 min. mark. Reacher looses a one-on-one fight. Sorry, at 6'5"" and 250 there is no way he ever lost a fight one-on-one since he was 6. That is straight from every book when Reacher gets into a fight.
Dwayne Johnson is 6'5"". I don't see him as Reacher (too pretty) but at least he is the right size."
" Tom isn't Jack
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,2,"Tom Cruise is just not believable as Jack Reacher. He may be OK as Ethan Hunt, but he doesn't come close to the physical descriptions of Reacher in the novels.If they are going to do another Reacher movie, they need to get Karl Urban."
" Adequate action flick
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,6,"The second Jack Reacher film (based on Lee Child's 18th book, 'Never Go Back') is much the same as the first film - still not as good as the novel, but a serviceable action film nonetheless. I'm not sure why, if they're going to franchise the series, they don't go in chronological order? It takes most of the plot from the book: a Military Police Major, Turner (Smulders) is framed for espionage, so Reacher (Cruise) decides to exonerate her by finding/killing who has set her up.It's amazing Cruise doesn't appear to have aged at all in 4 years! People still hate that he's not the 6 foot-plus hulk from the books, but Cruise brings an intensity to the role, while not always being stony. The difference is that instead of being a loner, he's paired up with Turner and Samantha (Yarosh), so there's three of them on the run, making for a different dynamic that doesn't always work, especially since he's not the most paternal. Since it's a cruise film, there's plenty of running - see above - which even Smulders gets in on!It's certainly not bad - enough hand-to-hand fights and shoot-outs to tick the 'action' box, as well as a bit of a murder-mystery to be solved. The main issue is it's a little long and there's nothing unique in it - it's all pretty standard and unforgettable."
" A very good movie, but not for the action fanatics
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,9,"After the original I expected this one to be good, and indeed it was good. In my opinion it's even better as the first one. I don't get most of the low ratings/bad reviews about this movie, however some I sort of understand:Yes, there is less action then expected. But I think this is a good instead of a bad thing. If you watch this movie for the action alone I get why you're disappointed. If you are watching this movie as a movie and not only for the action, then I think this is your movie. The story of the movie is good and gets you really into watching the whole movie. However I agree with some of the reviews that mentioned the 'bad side/bad guys' stayed somewhat dull. In general I think that if they added a few more minutes to the movie to deepen the bad guy story, to add a little bit more action and to (sort of) slow down some of the scenes it would have been a better movie.Conclusion: I stay with my opionion that it's a really good movie. For me i think the general rating should lie somewhere beteen the 7 and 8.5 out of ten.
If you are going to watch this movie and expect a whole lot of action scenes and five minutes of story, then be prepared to be disappointed. If you are going to watch this movie and are willing to compromise a little on the action scenes....then yes... go watch the movie."
" Played like formula rather than Reacher
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,6,"This one for me did not live up to the previous. I felt like I was watching a formula tv action show. If they had been a little more on intensity and perhaps focus more on the a loner Reacher dark hero rather than the strong woman feminist type sidekick and annoying girl, this would have been a much better movie. I almost started to expect a fluffy dog to join the trio aswell.
If they make another, I would hope they take a leaf out of Jason borne movies."
" A good action thriller, if undemanding
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,7,"Well what do you expect? It's a Jack Reacher movie starring Tom Cruise and that's exactly what you get!It's a good action flick with excellent production values, a good cast, a good (enough) story line and lots of baddies to take down.As Reacher, Cruise does his sardonic best (although it's doubtful if anyone who has read any of the books would cast him as Reacher) and makes a fair (sort of) job of it but just go with it, eh.It's action-packed but light. I picked this to watch over more 'serious' movies so if you like your action thrillers action-packed and thrilling - but not terribly demanding - you'll like this."
" Hmm, well..
",2017-12-08 00:00:00,5,"I gave the first Jack Reacher movie 8/10, definitely worth watching. For this, I kept thinking about the issues I had with this movie, after I was done watching. Initially, I gave this movie 7/10, then went down to 6/10 and eventually settled on 5/10.The thing is, this movie is just.. OK. First movie introduced you to Jack Reacher and his style (I have not read the books) and to be honest, Jack Reacher is a toned down Ethan Hunt (Mission Impossible), solving military cases. But it worked and the first movie was entertaining.Never Go Back, does the same thing, but tries too hard to make Jack Reacher ""cool"", especially with the opening setup which made no sense (the trailer IS the opening) and just happened cause it was supposed to make Jack look cool.. I guess to the audience who haven't seen the first movie? But whatever, moving on, he suddenly has a love interest and a supposed child. Which turns most of the movie into a sitcom with action scenes severely feeling ""meh"" despite probably doing more than the first movie. No idea who they were aiming for when they picked this book to make a movie out of (family?).Also, the ""daughter"" is played by a 18 yr old actress playing 15 yr old and she doesn't look 15 at all. That said, she played her part just fine.The ""love interest"" on the other hand is a tough new age woman that tries REALLY hard to look and act tough. It just became ridiculously funny the more she acted that way, while looking like a supermodel. Perfectly captured a strong feminist I guess? I dunno, it was just funny cause she had trouble even defeating one guy properly and they had to bring Jack to her level to make her look tough. It's pathetic.The point is, the story goes nowhere in the end with her. All that happens is she gets implicated, runs away, then goes back to doing what she was doing before.Few action scenes are OK, nothing amazing. I did like the last chase scene for some reason. It was pretty realistic the way goons were looking for a character.5/10"
" Unwatchable
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,1,5 foot 8 Cruise is miscast as the 6 foot 5 Jack Reacher and despite the low camera angles he can't pull off the character. This unbelievable casting distracts constantly and along with a silly story make this film a waste of time. As an experienced filmmaker I would have thought Cruise would have realized his unsuitability for the role. As such this series is likely doomed.
" Action enough, fast enough
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,6,"Another shoot them up/get shot at fugitive/crime fighter movie. The formula is not all that monotonous. A bit predictable maybe though. It's the details of the fights and escapes that are entertaining. Some good values. Bunch of killers worthy of being killed. Two good-looking girls, one also ass-kicking. I liked!"
" As enjoyable as the book
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,8,"Appreciation of art and intelligence are closely related. That is, some people like country music and some people like classical music. The same goes for paintings, books, and movies. Lee Child is my kind of writer, neither too intellectual nor too simplistic (I think he's a very smart writer). I've read all of his Jack Reacher novels but one. This one (by mistake, apparently). The movie Jack Reacher: Never Go Back was a very good implementation of the book (which I'm now reading), and I can see how the writer/director, Ed Zwick, kept the basic plot and the flavor of the book while making it a very good movie and under 2 hours long (Richard Wenk was also the writer). And I don't understand why some people think Tom Cruise is too small (some people think size matters). He seemed like Jack Reacher to me. Thank you, Lee Child and Ed Zwick."
" Second Jack Reacher Film Fails to Deliver
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,4,"I loved the first Jack Reacher movie!! I thought it was well paced, intriguing, had intelligent dialogue, characters that had some emotional depth, great action, and the story was well executed and very interesting. Never Go Back tried to repeat the success of Jack Reacher, but failed for several reasons:1) In the first Jack Reacher film, Tom Cruise absolutely hit the exact tone that was needed to make the movie work. His character was intense when he needed to be, but was able to downshift into a desire to still see the case through yet not get too emotionally involved. But in Never Go Back, he cranked his character's sensitivity to such a low level that he almost appeared like he was completely dead inside. This pushed many of the scenes into coming of as incredibly unrealistic and fake. Cruise's character would have done much better increasing his character's emotion level up a little from the first film rather than down. Cruise went the wrong way in Never Go Back.2) Cobie Smulders is nice to look at, but she really can't act. The delivery of her dialogue seemed (most of the time) so over the top, labored, and forced. There were scenes where it seemed like she was just reading from a cue card. She was also miscast in Never Go Back. What was needed in this character was someone who was attractive and sexy, yet exhibited toughness at the same time. Smulders fit the mold for the former (almost too much), but not the latter. Again, a lot of her failure in this area was in her acting ability (or lack thereof). Someone like a Sandra Bullock, Gina Carano (her acting ability may be questionable, but she still an improvement over Smulders), or Demi Moore (10 years younger) would have been better casting choices for the part of Turner. I just couldn't buy Smulders being the head of a military police unit in the film – it seemed very implausible and unbelievable and, therefore, it kinda wrecked a lot of the movie for me.3) Some of the dialogue in this film was just downright corny and stupid. There were some scenes where it was so blatantly obvious that they were trying to capitalize on some of the great lines from the first Jack Reacher film. Although the dialogue was different in Never Go Back, the manner and circumstances where the aforementioned lines were delivered was so clearly recycled. As a result, it gave the movie too much predictability and made it somewhat boring. A good action-thriller gives you plot twists and doesn't telegraph where it's going, but in too many instances in Never Go Back, you knew exactly what was going to happen purely from the dialogue. In her defense, it wasn't all Smulders' lack of acting ability or her fault where her character failed –the sheer stupidity of some of the lines she had to utter did contribute as well.4) Never Go Back had some scenes that struck me as very implausible – like the characters being able to move from point A to point B in a matter of seconds (when in reality it would take several minutes) and human beings taking such a level of physical abuse that afterwards their faces would look like uncooked hamburger or their bones would be completely shattered, yet they had the stereotypical Hollywood small trickle of blood from the side of their nose or mouth. Oh please!! I would give the first Jack Reacher film an 8 or 9, but Never Go Back fell miserably flat and was only a 4. It just failed badly to live up to the expectations I had going in, almost to the point of not really looking forward to the next Jack Reacher filmif there is one."
" Formulaic and Familiar
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,6,"Jack Reacher 2 doesn't bring anything new to the action genre, but there's nothing wrong with that. It is another Tom Cruise action movie, smaller in scope than the Mission Impossible movies, but still exciting with plenty of action scenes. They mix it up a little from the standard formula by taking the lone wolf Jack Reacher and making him work with others. Those others, Cobie Smulder's Major Turner and a teenage girl (Danika Yarosh), also prefer to work alone, so there is some conflict besides the main plot and villains.Speaking of those villains, there is really no depth there. There is the standard Bond formula of a big evil guy behind a desk and his agent working in the field. Neither one is developed as a character and there is no reason to care about what they are doing because there is no real risk that they are out-thinking Jack Reacher."
" Jack Over-Reached
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,3,"The first Jack Reacher was decent. It had a decent script, it was decently acted, decently edited, decently scored. All- around decent. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back has none of those things. The script feels like it was cobbled together with fragments of incomplete ideas with no resolutions, which makes the pacing seem disjointed and the story unfocused with no clear plot motivators. The acting is disingenuous, with a surprising weak link in Cobie Smulders, who has proved herself more than capable in the past. Here she isn't very commanding in her role as an authoritarian Army Major. Danika Yarosh's abrasive, unlikable Mary Sue performance is especially weak. Perhaps Yarosh's nominal talent is best reserved for rubberized CW Dramas. Tom Cruise seems to want nothing more than to not be in this movie, an inference that's clear in every bland-as-paste read he gives. The Jack Reacher in the first movie was at least relatable and --to some degree-- likable. This Jack Reacher is a boring jerk. I saw a better performance from him in The Mummy. You would expect that the main character of the film would be able to keep the intrigue of the audience, but Cruise seems more invested in the paycheck than the character, which I'm sure is a symptom of the weak script. By far, the absolute worst transgression of this film is the score, which seems cut/pasted from every other cheap ""high- intensity action-thriller"" made-for-TV. It sounds terribly unoriginal, ill-fit, and often times doesn't make any sense where it queues up. It tries too hard to build tension, but isn't written well enough to do that, rendering it disinteresting, dissatisfying, and ineffective. It feels off-the-rack, rather than tailored. This film is so boring, I couldn't even find a way to make this review funny."
" A sleeper (in a bad way)
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,3,A real sleeper (literally). Is it fair for me to write a review where I drifted in and out of wakefulness? I think so. Cruise is fine as Jack Reacher. The very beginning of the movie was the best part. The problem with the rest of the movie is the story line was just plain silly. A very typical plot. Bad guys chasing the good guys. Good guys trying to find the answers. Big boring fight scenes. Enough said. At least I feel rested today.
" Why TC ?
",2017-11-16 00:00:00,9,"I give this movie, and the previous Jack Reacher movie, a 9. It would have got a 10 if: Jack Reacher, all 6 foot 6 inches, and 250 pounds, were portrayed by an actor at least close to these numbers. But to be played by a 5 foot 7 inch, 150 pound-er (wet), well, that just doesn't fit the bill, for die-hard Jack Reacher fans. Any chance of re-casting the role for future movies?"
" This is really a B-Movie
",2017-11-15 00:00:00,3,"I watched this movie on Netflix today and I have to admit that this is really awful. The acting of Tom Cruise's supporting group is just the worst. Tom always does a good job, but if he didn't this would have really been a mess. The whole story line of the daughter who isn't really a daughter could have been left out completely and it may have been a better movie. The nice thing about watching it on Netflix, I did it in my bedroom and it was cheap. I feel sorry for people who actually paid to see it."
" Generic But Watchable
",2017-11-07 00:00:00,7,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016)Plot In A Paragraph: Reacher must go on the run himself, when he tries to visit a friend, whom he has never met face to face, who has been arrested on false charges.Despite a promising opening 30 minutes this movie is very generic and by the numbers. it's like they took the template from one of my favourite movies (The Outlaw Josie Wales) 'The loner, who acquires a family along the way' and then mashed the best pieces from other scripts together and this is what they came up with. The main bad guy doesn't even have a name!! Unless I missed it. Whilst still insanely young looking for his age, for the second movie in a row Cruise is looking older than in his previous movie. I think it helps with the weariness of his character. The final scene features some really good acting by Cruise, and if it stopped a minute earlier, it could have been heartbreakingly sad. Instead it kind of ruined itself. Cobie Smulders is fine, as is Danika Yrosh, but Robert Knepper is completely wasted. Why cast such a great actor, and then give him nothing to do?? Jack Reacher: Never Look Back grossed $58 million at the domestic Box Office to end 2016 the 56th highest grossing movie of the year. There will probably be no more in this series, which is a shame, as it had potential if done correctly."
" A bit of a Reach
",2017-11-06 00:00:00,6,"I enjoyed the first installment of this series so I was willing to give this movie a try with an open mind considering it was a lazy Sunday and I know the format of most action movies. The first 30 minutes of this movie was enjoyable but somewhere after Tom Cruise met with Cobie Smulder's character it turned into the typical cliché chase movie. I found myself telling my friend who walked in half way though the movie that in many parts of this movie there was many moments where you have to suspend your disbelief. Such that, a lot of the plot and the tying in of major points were just ways for the story to continue, at first I just assumed that Cruises training would come into play which is entertaining but later on it was just a masquerade of plot devices that were used to explain or not explain how they boarded a plane or sought refuge here or escaped or what not. The most unbelievable is Cruise hiding behind a shelf in the kitchen... um hello he's right there in plain view almost laughable. The dialogue became weak as well: ""I'm going to break your legs, then your arms, then your neck"" geez what else. The whole young girl that they have to protect I also found cliché', I wish what they did right in the first quarter of the movie would continue, but no the enemy was the typical 'bad guy' Ill do anything to finish off Reacher and he couldn't be stopped until the cliché again final fight scene. It was a little disappointing because the things that did work well in the first one such as plot development, well thought out fight scenes, and more plausible death defying action sequences wasn't the key focus in this movie. But what I do learn from both movies is: if you need to escape a crime scene or in desperation jump on a bus."
" Absolutely dreadful
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,1,"I wanted my 2 hours of life back from this made for TV direct to video movie. The story, direction, cinematography, music, were never at any point engaging or makes any sense at all. This movie is so wrong on so many layers I don't even want to spend more time on explaining. Just avoid it at any cost, even rental or download."
" Cruise Cameos Boring Female Version of Reacher
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,4,"No pressure to be involved in the investigation. You forget they are even investigating a real crime and just watch loosely connected scenes. Character tension is cliché and completely lacking any energy.Female actor does not pull off the ""tough girl, I can be like a man as well"" script - remove her, and the Script can continue with Reacher by himself.Suspected that Lee Child, or at least the Reacher brand in general, has fallen victim to Hollywood female-centric thinking. The reason Reacher was a popular character in the previous movie is because he is an intense man who has had enough, who knows and appreciates cars and guns, and doing the right thing. The crowd that watched the previous film appreciated these values. The audience has been betrayed by subjecting Reacher to a pseudo-paternal role, where the female lead acts as a pseudo-maternal equal. This film is about social and authority control, something the previous audience does not enjoy.No character tensions, no interesting investigation, no plot pressure, and a liberal mood on a franchise that was quite conservative in its values (as opposed to assertions). Like the Terminator franchise, stopping at Terminator 2 saves the franchises reputation. Stopping at the first Jack Reacher will do the same for you as well.Watch it is a freebie if you have too, do not buy (i.e. female lead threatens to attack Jack Reacher, this is a laughable threat given body and muscle mass difference, yet the movie tries to make it a viable reality, as if this is a real possibility)."

" I don't like being followed
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,6,"Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) is back and teams up with fugitive Major Turner (Cobie Smulders) who is his military replacement to fight evil government contractors while on the run from both the government who want to arrest them and contractors who want them dead. Toss into the mix 15 year old Samantha (Danika Yarosh) who acts similar to Reacher and may be his daughter.The film has lost the charm of the first film. No one knows who this man was and his ways were unorthodox but effective. In this film, everyone knows him, and his antics are not much better than Seagal and less than Liam Neeson. Hopefully they will come up something closer to the original in the future, indeed, this one started out that way in the opening scene (the one in all the previews) but fizzles.Best line about Reacher: ""They ran out of medals."" Guide: No sex or nudity."
" Painful
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,1,"This is quite possibly the worst movie I have seen in a long long long time. Whatever you do don't waste 2 hours of your life watching this tosh when you could spend it cleaning your toilet or ironing your underwear whilst listening to Celine Dion. This isn't an action movie it should be in the comedy section, it's so bad it's funny. Everyone involved is atrocious from the director, producer, editor and especially the cast who are so wooden that I almost got a splinter off them when I reached out to turn off the TV. In fact maybe the next one (heaven forbid if they make it), should be titled Jack I'm going to Reach: It's bucket time. Thinking about it I've actually wasted 10 minutes writing this review which I'll never get back but I'm just hoping someone even just one person reads this so I can save them from all the pain I've suffered."
" ""Does this mean dinner's off?""
",2017-09-08 00:00:00,8,"I don't go with what seems like the majority here who complain that the film is terrible. I'll concede that it's not as good as the first film in the franchise; that one was plotted superbly with virtually no flaws or plot holes to detract from the story. This one's a little more predictable, as it deals with contraband weapons being sold to insurgents by a former shadowy military contractor.I'd point to the inclusion of Cobie Smulders as the bright spot for this picture. Her Major Turner character is no cream puff, and the action scenes she engages in nicely complement the heroics one expects of the film's principal character. Tom Cruise is competent in the title role, but the thing is, having a protagonist like Jack Reacher sued for child support is never going to work. If the guy says he doesn't know the woman, you can pretty safely bet he doesn't know the woman. I was surprised that the alleged daughter Samantha (Danica Yarosh) didn't understand the first thing about surveillance tracking capability of cell phones and credit cards, but it wasn't the actress's fault. She seemed fairly intelligent otherwise, but then again, at fifteen I wonder how many teenagers simply take the technology for granted and never give it a second thought. I mean, there are enough examples of really stupid people posting the most embarrassing stuff on you-tube that's enough to get them arrested, so I guess it's possible she was clueless.Oddly enough, I liked the character of The Hunter, portrayed by Patrick Huesinger. He was relentless, capable, smart and an interesting match for Cruise's Reacher. He nailed it when he described himself and his adversary, and provided insight into the movie's title when he stated - ""People like us, we can never go back to the world""."
" ...but he did go back and got into a trouble!
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,7,"The original source is a long book series, so they did not do it in order. Like the first film, which was based on the ninth book, this one was on the eighteenth. It was a stylishly made film. The actors were good, and their stunts were excellent. But not the storyline. This is a very familiar theme. You know, someone framed you and you go on to dig the truth while everyone trying to hunt you down. There are lots of close encounter, which give great thrilling entertainment. So, other than the story, everything looked fine.Jack goes to meet one of his ex colleagues at his old headquarters. But soon he discovers she's behind the bars and now he's too for the crime they did not do. So escaping from the prison and looking for clues, who framed them and why, all one by one disclosed with some excellent running-chasing action sequences. The film almost as good as any timepass action film. But like it was the new wine in an old bottle. So it won't work for everyone, especially those with greater expectations.The 55 year old Tom Cruise on the edge to become a veteran actor, but still he got that action hero macho in him. Probably another 3-4 films, including the upcoming 'Mission: Impossible' sequel. So this franchise could replace his cast with younger one in the future. Because another 20 books to go. Though, I'm thinking about the television series. Cobie too was awesome. The film justifies to its original, but not more than an above average. So good for once watching it.6.5/10"
" Tom Cruise was lousy pick for playing Jack Reacher
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,1,I wonder if the producers ever looked at Liev Schribar (Ray Donovan) who almost looks like Jack Reacher and is more comparable in physical size than Tom (I'm so short) Cruise. Anybody who has read the Jack Reacher books can picture him as he is described. Jack was a Marine and Cruise is or was nothing.
" Not bad
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,8,"Not a bad sequel. Some parts were predictable and have the ""yeah, right"" moment, but lots of action. Tom Cruise showed he's aging like the rest of us, Cobie was pretty bad ass! Could've done without the ""daughter"" aspect, but I guess they needed another target for the bad guys. Please don't ruin it by doing another!"
" Not bad, but it could (and should) have been better
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,6,"JACK REACHER: NEVER GO BACK is the second of two Hollywood adaptations based on the books of Lee Child. The first film was a pretty decent thriller, not amazing, and this film is much the same. It starts off very well with a strong first hour but gradually descends into becoming average in the second half. The problem I had with it is that Reacher is saddled with the stereotypically annoying/sentimental teenage girl, who constantly does dumb things in order to further the storyline. Otherwise, it's the typical conspiracy business, bolstered by good suspense and action bits, as Reacher takes down opponents in fleeting moments reminiscent of BOURNE. Cruise delivers an acceptable level of intensity in the lead and the direction from the assured Edward Zwick is fine, so it's just a pity that the story flags at times with bloated character work and too much 'hanging around' when it should be moving forward at all times."

Watchable with a beer in one hand and not having to think too much. A sofa fodder film when nothing else is on. My rating 4 out of 10"
" Never Go Back to See it Again
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,3,I am a big fan of Lee Child's Reacher novels and this is as poor a conversion from book to movie as I have seen. The plot never rises above Murky. It reminds me of the last batch of Steven Seagal movies. Lots of gunfire and martial arts that make me look for subtitles or dubbing. That bad. Tom Cruise is WOODEN and sometimes unintelligible. Don't waste your time. Just read the book...
" The aptly named: Never Go Back
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,3,"Alas, the production team didn't take the lead from the name of the film. Instead of never going back to this character, they put together a mediocre crew of Tom Cruise connected writers who set the tone for this weak sequel. The lazy story and pathetic dialog didn't provide the cast and director with much to work with, so we're left with a pale offshoot of the Christopher McQuarrie penned first film. On its own, this would probably be passable, but in comparison to the first it's just shameful."
" I couldn't finish it

I'm pretty good at turning my brain off, suspending my disbelief, forgiving poor script writing etc, but I simply couldn't make it past the 40 minute mark of this film. Literally EVERYTHING about it is bad, bad, bad. The script, the acting, the directing, the sets, the music, the editing. Oh, the editing. If you watch this film and make it far enough to see the black and white flashback sequences, you'll know what I mean. But I sincerely hope you save your time and don't make it that far. Trust me. You'll regret it."
" Predictable Cruise action film - star-driven but not much else
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,5,"""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" (2016) is a formulaic action movie starring Tom Cruise playing his typical hyper-competent hero shtick. The movie opens with a silly set-piece in a bar with Reacher being unsuccessfully arrested for single handedly defeating a bunch of lowlifes, which sets the tone for the rest of the film, as Reacher is set up as he tries to help Cobie Smulders' Major Susan Turner character, who has herself been set-up. The movie then moves from set-piece to set-piece (escape#1, chase#1, fight#1, escape#2, fight#2, chase#2 etc) – all of which are pretty much the same. The villains are, as usual, lethally competent when dealing with anyone but Reacher and the army sufficiently inept that Reacher and Turner can easily escape from a high-security military prison. To provide the otherwise omnipotent Reacher with an Achilles' heel, a potential daughter is introduced, who is routinely menaced by the ""The Hunter"" (Patrick Heusinger), a verbose assassin who spends much of the movie exchanging alpha-dog barks with Reacher. The whole 'daughter' (Danika Yarosh) plot-driver is ridiculous – the girl admits that she encouraged her mother to file for child support but, as the mother and Reacher had never met, it is unclear (at least to me) why Reacher was chosen and how the army would know (as it could not have gone through the courts or Reacher would have recognized the girl or at least the mother). The answer is likely the tentacles of the bad guys messing with Reacher's records but why they would choose such mundane and easily disproved 'fake-news' to besmirch a guy with every medal offered by the US Army is puzzling. The whole movie suffers from coincidence and convenience. The girl is remarkably easy to find in a city full of people (even when she is not giving away their position by using credit cards etc) – even in the crowded streets of Mardi Gras, she seems to be a beacon attracting the heavies. One wonders, if Reacher and Turner are so clever, why they wouldn't at least cut the girl's long blond hair so she would not be an exact match to the picture being used to identify her or why, on a street full of masked revellers, it never occurred to the girl to put on a mask. Instead she runs through convenient channels that open in the crowd with The Hunter's goons in pursuit. Fortunately, unlike 'The Hunter' and Reacher, the goons are fragile and can be eliminated by a single punch or kick (Reacher has to be beaten half to death before he even bruises). Reacher is a typical Cruise action-figure role and the actor delivers exactly what his fans expect, no more but no less. Cobie Smulders looks great in the best fitting uniform in the US army, as well as in her tough-chick outfits, and various states of undress, otherwise, she's just background (typically, she's only as competent as the plot requires at any given moment). Danika Yarosh's is OK as ""Sam"" the pseudo-daughter, the weakest character in the story, as she goes from an extremely unconvincing street kid to a uniform-wearing school girl (a process that involves several cringe-worthy scenes). You just know that when they devote a whole lot of film to her bonding with tough-soldier Turner by learning how to disarm a person, she's going to play a pivotal role in the demise of ""The Hunter"" – so at that point, save yourself a half hour and fast forward to the final fight (then shut the movie down after the final gruff utterance and bone snap)."
" Fun, well done B movie fare
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,6,"Eventually I suppose Tom Cruise will grow up and realize he can't be an action movie star any more, but in Jack Reacher: Never Go Back he's still soldiering on (pun intended). I think he's actually a pretty capable actor (recent examples e.g. Edge of Tomorrow, Oblivion, and going back to Minority Report, Magnolia, Jerry Maguire, Rain Man). But this Jack Reacher outing is just a by-the-numbers actioner. The plot is all conventional, but it's well done and consistently fun to watch. I saw it on Netflix last month to give me something to watch while on my exercycle, and for that purpose it was just fine.So, Reacher (now retired from the military) and his former colleague Major Turner (the versatile Cobie Smulders) have both been framed by an insidious group inside the government for something-or-other, and they have to go rogue and undercover to eventually expose the conspiracy. Along the way they pick up the tritely rebellious girl Samantha (Danika Yarosh, who's no more than OK in the part) who may or may not be Reacher's previously unknown daughter. The rest of it is just enjoying the ride through a complex series of settings and incidents. And of course we get to see Mr. Cruise indulging his obsession for dramatic running -- lots of running. When he can't run any more, maybe that's when he'll realize it's time to hang it up.All in all, a good popcorn flick that does well what it sets out to do."
" Generic and bland
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,2,"After watching the original Jack Reacher film and not being much of a fan of that, I was not expecting much more from this sequel. Seeing as the reviews for the followup were worse than the original. Never Go Back feels more like a standard typical action film and less like a mystery and suspense that the first film was. This film is less exciting and with new characters, that are worse, nothing special and new occurs in this film that we haven't seen in past action films. A lot of clichés. It was clear this film was made for a quick cash- grab since the original film was a moderate success (thanks to the foreign market). The overall box office numbers for this film are lesser than the original and that may spark some case for concern regarding Tom Cruise's star power, or perhaps movie goers noticed the bad reviews, and decided not to watch this film in theaters. In some ways, this film feels like Taken (and a lesser version of Taken). In general, Never Go Back is quite dull, bland and what was good in the first film, is non-existent in this film."
" #1= Dumb, #2= Dumber
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,1,"Cruise has got to let go of this garbage franchise. I know he doesn't like to lose at anything, but ""Jack Reacher"" he ain't, and the scripts are as bad as he is in them.90% of this movie he spends gazing at Cobie Smulders, while she tries be be scary (not). Every time he opens his mouth, it is some dumb cliché. I don't know how IMDb is rating this a 6.1, when most of the reviews are well under a 6. However, since the boards have closed, this seems to be the norm: Promote, Promote, Promote.The first flick was bad. This one was obscenely bad. Then to add insult to injury, it comes down to the big ""fist fight"" to end it. Garbage movie, avoid like the plague. One star, because I can't rate it a ZERO."
" Clichéd mail-in of a sequel. Smulders is the highlight.
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,5,"An irony of mediocre movies like Jack Reacher is that they lead you to have low expectations of sequels, allowing the positive elements to stand out. Never Go Back is just as far from greatness as its predecessor, but it moves a little better. Director Edward Zwick (who is clearly in this for the money) streamlines the movie almost to a fault. An over edited movie can make the world seem like a very small place.Kudos to Cruise for wiping most of the smugness off his face, but compared to the young blooded Cobbie Smulders, he feels like a sour old crone. Never Go Back is more entertaining when the camera is on her. She is not a big woman but she is a force to be reckoned with. At one point she threatens to grab a superior officer by the hair and b***h slap the s**t out of him. Her sincerity is so comanding that it almost makes you understand why such cheesy lines make it into scripts. Half of the script in fact is comprised of this kind of dialog; ""I want names numbers, phone records, favourite flavours of ice cream""The action scenes are largely derivative of similar set piece from past movies, especially the old' punch out in the musty boiler room, or the chase scene through a carnival crowd. The material pairs up Reacher with a daughter character: the generic rebel child he never knew he had until he was told. She is a device used more for plot advancement than for emotional impact. There is a goodbye scene at the end which would have been stronger had it been in any other (better) movie. The single biggest problem is that Never Go Back exercises almost every cliché of the genre; from the people who are corrupt to the custody escape by means of a guards uniform. At least we have the delights of Smulders to offer some relief."
" Dissatisfied
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,5,"Now don't get me wrong, this movie had redeeming value, but it was just missing something the first one had. I am a strong believer that the first movie was much better than what people give it credit for. This one is terrible compared to the first. Tom Cruise gives a Tom Cruise performance, good enough but nothing special. The rest of the cast is not as good. Colbie Smulders is not bad, but her and Cruise have zero chemistry. All the other actors were not good at all. Now the plot was awful. It did not make any sense at all and it did not pull me in. There was no where near as much mystery as there was in the first movie. This one had a boneheaded plot that should have been in a T.V show. Now I will say this movie had OK action and looked fairly good. Other than that, a boring movie pumped iut just to make money."
" Back And How!
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,7,"2012's Jack Reacher was a letdown. It was a lanky blockbuster, that worked because it had a superstar donning the titular role. However, 'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back' is a surprisingly entertaining sequel, that outdoes its prequel by bounds. Its actually good B-movie fun!'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back' Synopsis: Jack Reacher must uncover the truth behind a major government conspiracy in order to clear his name. On the run as a fugitive from the law, Reacher uncovers a potential secret from his past that could change his life forever.'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back' benefits due to its fast-pace, that keeps you in your seat. Though its a predictable ride, it still keeps you interested & the action is well-done. And it always helps if you have Edward Zwick calling the shots. The Veteran Director is on-point here & delivers an entertaining Action Film, that's worth your buck. Richard Wenk, Zwick & Marshall Herskovitz's Screenplay is predictable, but its well-paced nonetheless. Cinematography & Editing are decent.Performance-Wise: Tom Cruise scores well in his second portrayal as Jack Reacher. The Superstar is in form this time & is comfortable beating up the bad-guys. Cobie Smulders looks absolutely gorgeous & is pretty good for her part. Danika Yarosh is adequate. Aldis Hodge is alright.On the whole, 'Jack Reacher: Never Go Back' is a fun time, without doubt."
" Better than the first one
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,7,"I don't get why people dislike this movie, for me it was much better than the first one. I read all Reacher-books, however, I disliked the Jack Reacher (1) movie. I had no problem with T.Cruise being Reacher, but I hated how he acted and spoke, for me it was kind of strange and ridiculous. I suppose that must have been some American thing I cannot grasp. :) And I hated R. Pike looking dumb with big eyes all the time, and I disliked Jay Courtney's character and acting as well.But with this I had no problem, Cruise became a better Reacher, both ladies were interesting characters and good actors, and there was action enough. And I liked the cinematography. In my opinion similar movies normally have 7,1-7,3 out of 10, not 6,1...."
" Pun intended?
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,6,"You do wonder if anyone was thinking about the title, when they made the movie. We're talking sequel here and you have a never go back in the title? I do understand people not liking to put a number after the initial title, because maybe they did marketing research and it doesn't really get people riled up ... but I don't think they chose right when it came to the sub-title for this one.Anyway, if this was the only thing that was wrong with the movie, everything would be alright. And it does start kind of intriguing. Although it quickly turns into a by the numbers kind of deal. It's not really bad and it does what it is supposed to (also action wise and everything) ... it's just not something memorable"
" So very predictable.
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,4,"This review has quite a few spoilers in it.I really like the first film but this one was so unbelievably predictable.As soon as Arms sales were mentioned I knew it wasn't going to be that and it would end up being Drugs, right from the start and before the ""Poppy Fields"" remarks. Reminds me of the heavy handed ""Tempus Fugit"" explanation remark from Tomb Raider.Also why is it that whenever someone who knows no Martial Arts gets taught a single move it's always used to help get the bad guy at the end, and what a one dimensional Bad Guy, I don't blame the actor but the writers of this film, it had no twists at all. They must have been told to give the plot a single sentence summary and that's what the script was made from.Almost as bad as a street smart girl using a stolen credit card to buy some room service, come on, really?The Top Bad guy was woefully underused and not very scary at all. I also predicted a bad officer turning back to good, though I chose the wrong one.Again it's an action film, where it's one fight scene linked to another by a few lines of dialogue, like so many made recently. I know Hollywood can do much better, and I wish they would."
" A Dull, Dreary Let Down,
",2017-05-31 00:00:00,4,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is a lackluster movie with a poorly developed plot, despite a stellar cast. The performances is what saved this movie from becoming a complete dud. Tom Cruise is in great a form as ever as the title character, his natural charisma and energy on screen is evident throughout. Cruise always has great chemistry with his love interest Cobie Smulders, albeit not as strong an actress on screen, she fits in to her role nicely. Reacher is very different in this movie, he is not the arrogant self centred man he was in the original. While I guess the writers wanted to add more humanity to him, it simply made the character far less appealing, as he was more predictable. The first movie worked because it was not written with Cruise in mind, however this film was, displaying him as more of a protagonist than an anti-hero as a result. It is more so a Tom Cruise movie, rather than a Jack Reacher sequel. As well as that, it is a ridiculously typical action film. There is not a single chase, or one choreographed movement, that we did not already see coming from a mile away, and it offers nothing that has not been used more effectively in other films. Every beat is predictable and I did not care for a single character. Slow and boring, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back let me down immensely, as a fan of the original, and I could not possibly recommend it. Jack Reacher discovers a secret from his past while on the run from the government. Best Performance: Tom Cruise / Worst Performance: Danika Yarosh"

The villains are straight out of central casting, it's just bad bad baaaaaaad.Some of the action sequences are well choreographed, but you have to sit through so much twaddle you just don't care.Donate your money to charity instead, it's a shame the production team didn't do the same with their budget."

",2017-05-10 00:00:00,3,"A usually charismatic presence that gives his all no matter the cause, I truly can't recall a time when I've seen acting superstar Tom Cruise looking as bored and tired as he does here, in the sequel nobody asked for and one you wish you never went back for, Jack Reacher: Never Go Back.2012's Jack Reacher didn't exactly set the world on fire, but the big screen incarnation of Lee Child's continually popular creation was a fine thriller, with some above average set pieces and production values so there was quiet optimism that new director Ed Zwick (I demand to know what has happened to the man that gave us The Last Samurai and Blood Diamond?) and returning star Cruise could at least capture that mid-level success Christopher McQuarrie's film did but alas, it was not to be.A terribly unexciting affair that sees Reacher spend more time with his potential teenage daughter and uninteresting potential love interest Major Turner (played devoid of charisma by Cobie Smulders) as they fight bland baddies and try to discover the what's what of a shady military murder, Zwick fails to capture any of the excitement of the Reacher brand and for a big budgeted thriller that could easily provide thrills and spills, this lacklustre experience is something not even Cruise on the best form of his life would've been able to save.Feeling like a more downtrodden and less interesting version of his Mission Impossible loving Ethan Hunt, Cruise was a stoic if unmemorable Reacher in the series first instalment but here he has become nothing more than a passenger wandering through his own aimless journey and for perhaps the first time, Cruise the action guru feels slightly too old and hampered to be what we need him to be here and maybe a decade or so ago Cruise may've enlivened the sub-par material on offer here but at current face value, it's too much for the veteran to do and his upcoming films like this year's Mummy reboot will be needing much more from this movie maverick to succeed.Final Say – After a disappointing run at cinemas and lukewarm at best reviews, it seems as though we may in fact never be going back to this once potentially decent series and this lame, tired and genuinely unengaging Jack Reacher adventure will likely not even be a film those many dedicated fans of Lee Child's creation can enjoy.1 ½ salt shakers out of 5"
" Every bit as entertaining as the first movie...
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,6,"I did enjoy the first ""Jack Reacher"" movie from 2012, and found that Tom Cruise actually did a great job in that movie. However, I wasn't fan enough to actually keep up to date with news around this 2016 sequel. So it was a nice surprise when I happened to get a chance to sit down to watch ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"".With my liking for the 2012 movie, then I had a certain level of expectation for the 2016 sequel. And I must admit that director Edward Zwick managed to pull off quite nicely, and ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" turned out to be every bit as entertaining and thrilling as the original 2012 movie was.The storyline in ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" is equally thrilling and well-thought through as the first movie. In this sequel the character Jack Reacher comes across a big government conspiracy and find that certain people will go to great lengths to silence him and keep secrets in the dark.True to the first movie, there is a good amount of action throughout the course of this movie. And once again, both Tom Cruise and the other people in the movie step up and deliver where it counts.It is actually quite nice to see Tom Cruise in movies such as this, because he manages to capture the essence of the character quite well. And he does prove that he is an actor with talent, especially so since you don't associate him with his numerous other roles in other movies as you watch ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"".""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" is fast-paced and has a good amount of action. But it is also a story that has some good writing to it, so it becomes a story that evolves and a story that is not overly predictable. This movie gives the audience value for their movie, no doubt about that.I could easily see a third movie coming to the Jack Reacher series, and if so, then it will definitely be a movie that I would watch.If you haven't already seen ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" then you should do so. It is not really a requirement to have seen the 2012 ""Jack Reacher"" movie prior to this, but it does add some depth to the character gallery."
" The Importance of Editing...
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,4,"""Never Go Back,"" was never going to live up to the first JR project, but it would've been better than, ""watchable,"" if not for the editing by, Billy Weber.I'm all about directing and editing, and this fell below the line in the edit; it felt rushed and unbalanced. McQuarrie/Child should've been brought back to direct/write, and Stitt to edit.Nothing against Zwick, but the continuity from the 1st to the second was lost; completely lost. Not unlike MI1 to MI2.The real standout in this movie is Danika Yarosh. She commits. Smolders smolders, at best. Cruise even seems preoccupied.Again, it's watchable, but the overriding awkwardness gets it a ""4."""
" Robin Ruined Reacher
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,5,"Just to be clear I'm a big fan of Cobie Smulders and her portrayal of kick-ass women. Of course Agent Hill, but especially the cute, lovable, baby hating, and trigger happy sociopath Robin Scherbatsky. Having said this, I have to admit she ruined the Jack Reacher Experience for me. Jack Reacher is entertaining because it features pure bigger-than-life, lonesome-rider machismo: ""There is no Jack Reacher in team""! He is bad-ass and nobody else is, except maybe much less so the villain. This worked excellent in the first instalment, the adding of Robin - sorry Major Turner - ruined it. And I have to emphasise, this is not a gender issue. I would like to see a: ""Jackie Reacher"" movie, starring Cobie Smulders or Angelina Jolie or Sigourney Weaver or Milla Jovovich or or or! However only with a damoiseau-in-distress male actor, no team partner. And yes - to be fair - it wasn't a bad movie, it could just have been much better."
" Never Go Back is the wrong book to make a film out of
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,6,"Like the Jack Reacher books but would have preferred something along the lines of Trip Wire for a flick. Way to many holes in this story. All those credit cards Samantha stole would have reported as stolen by the time they got to New Orleans. Tom doesn't really fit the role of a 6'5"" bad ass. Liked the 1st one better."
" Better than I thought
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,7,"Having read some of the negative reviews in here I almost didn't watch this movie. However I saw the trailer on YouTube and thought I would get the DVD. The movie is not bad at all and I enjoyed it.I watched the first one which was edgier than this one but this is still a good story and there is enough action to keep things moving.Tom Cruise is not my favourite actor and he is pretty much Tom Cruise in every film I have ever seen him in, but he seems to fit this part and was believable enough.Cobie Smulders was good and Danika Yarosh did her part just about right. Often the kids in these types of movies are really annoying but she wasn't.So over all this was a pretty good movie."
" Worst Tom Cruise movie since 'Days of Thunder'
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,1,"This is simply the worst Tom Cruise movie since the days of ""I know Cole he always goes to the outside"" and with an even lamer plot device.Tom is such a mystery to me, some of his films are absolutely brilliant. Vanilla Sky, Minority Report, Edge of Tomorrow, a Few Good Men, Jerry Maguire, Rain Man. Several of which would feature in my personal top-20 films of all time.Some of them are alright, Mission Impossible and Top Gun for example, not great but good solid popcorn films.And some are absolutely terrible; such as the rest of the Mission Impossible franchise, Far and Away, the aforementioned Days of Thunder.I'm wondering if the more creative control Mr Cruise has the worse the film (see: George Lucas). When he has clear direction, 'stand there, look good, say this line this way' he is brilliant. And in all fairness he is a terrific actor if, perhaps, a deeply flawed producer and writer. I would avoid this film at all costs. The plot is silly and the script is terrible. The action sequences are even more ridiculous, several thugs standing in a circle around Cruise, waiting for their turn to hit or be hit, none of them pulling out their guns and simply shooting him.Young actress Danika Yarosh is excellent and is star material.The rest of the cast is poorly cast and struggle to make a terrible script believable. Which is a shame as I believe the novels are excellent (though I have not personally read them)."
" Terrible reboot of an awaited sequel
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,4,"I really enjoyed the initial Jack Reacher movie (from 2012) and thought of it of an action packed exulting movie. In fact, it was near a discovery for me (did very well in the super & anti-hero genre) so, you can imagine the heighten expectation when I saw a second installment was out.But this new Reacher is anything but exiting. It was blend and highly predictable at best. Scenes succeed each other with sometimes lack of cohesion and depth, the story is horribly simple and cliché and the plot is laced with nonsensical chases and mind flashes (that are supposed to explain what is happening?). How did Jack even figure out what the story was all about near the very end ... while I had figured out 1/3rd through? We would even be tempted to ask ourselves how many military highly ranked people were involved in this plot-line (and why and how the villain characters were really related to each other) ... but by the end of this movie, we do not even care of questioning the perceived incoherence. Don't get me wrong though - I felt Cruise gave a fine performance overall - the script and orchestration of the movie in its final cut is just terrible."
" Jack should have operated alone
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,5,It had a decent if derivative story but the action was slowed down by having not one but two women interfering all the time. I have absolutely no problem with women in action films - think Ripley and Connor - but they just didn't belong here.Jack Reacher is a loner-he works things out himself - he fights alone - that's why we like him. But with this young girl in tow that he had to protect it started reminding me of 'Taken'.The prison escape scene was ludicrous - this isn't Mission Impossible Tom - more like Mission Improbable.So a disappointing rental - but the baddies were OK .
" One time watchable flick!!!
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,5,"Jack Reacher, a former military policeman travels to Virginia in order to pay a visit to his old friend Turner. Jack finds out that Turner has been relieved of her command and charged with espionage. Jack started to investigate about the whole incident in his way. It's an entertaining movie and in that sense it actually works. The fight sequences were good and the plot was very easy to predict. Like every Tom Cruise action flicks, this one also has some running scenes and Cruise is very good at running. It could've been a better movie and sadly it was a normal action flick from Cruise. Cobie Smulders was very impressive in her role. Overall, it's a one time watchable flick."
" Never should have been made in the first place
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,1,"As an avid reader of the books I (like many) was horrified that Tom Cruise was cast in the role of 6'5"" Jack Reacher, but I thought the first film was actually very good and bought into Lee Child's explanation that the descriptions of Reacher were a metaphor and he was a ""force of nature"".This however is a genuinely awful film. Cruise looks old now and is clearly out of shape in this film, which makes him look like a short man with a ""dad bod"" chasing bad guys - utterly implausible - and the only force of nature he could summon up would be a light breeze on a summer's day.I cannot believe that the budget was $60,000,000 - what the hell did they spend it on??? The cinematography is like watching a rerun of a 1970s made for TV film and is screamingly amateurish.Don't waste your time on watching this low budget, generic nonsense."
" Reacher don't
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,3,"eat at no IHOP. Just ask the TSA guy that took his plane ticket. Oops, he doesn't care, he's making a bundle off this movie.Bad script writing. The girl was consistently annoying. The new major's fighting skills relied more on luck than the leverage women need to be bad-ass, and can learn.The book Reacher uses his brains and this movie forgets it has any.Action is OK but totally predictable. Forgettable movie. Too bad. Cudda been much more."
" A new genre is born: Cliché Beige
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,1,"Yaaaaaaawn. Tommy Boy has managed to take a mediocre novel and infused with all the tension of a wet flannel falling in the bath. It has all the trade-craft of his usual ego trips, he's cool, unbeatable but a little flawed, and while no one on his film sets is allowed to make eye contact, we get lots of close ups of his cow-eyed attempts to look intelligent and hard. His hair and makeup never smudged, his co-actors have their wooden visages scuffed up regularly, making you deeply aware what an enigmatic polyp the stunted one is. And such reactions! He's so fast that he manages to ooof before the punch lands - that's reflexes for you. Miss him if possible"
" A disappointing sequel
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"A disappointing sequel. I didn't read the books, but it seems like there was something missing from the story between the two main characters. Great action scenes like the first one with plenty of Tom Cruise running shots. I would probably skip it unless you loved the first one or read the books."
" I Wish It Could Go Back To The Original.
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"I'm going to keep this simple and plain, ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" was not as good as the first ""Jack Reacher"". It wasn't too too bad, it just wasn't up to par with the first ""Jack Reacher"". The first ""Jack Reacher"" was way more complex and way more suspenseful than this sequel. ""Jack Reacher: Never Go Back"" really didn't even have the same feel as the original. Watching this film I could tell that the same director and writers from the first ""Jack Reacher"" film had nothing to do with this sequel. It was almost a totally different film, except for the fact that Tom Cruise starred in it. As far as the action, that was really the only good thing about this film. It just needed a better written script to make it complete. I think it could have been better."
" I liked it!!!
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,9,Some parts were cheesy but I loved this movie. Great acting not over sexual like you see in a lot of movies these days. I could just sit and watch without cringing or feeling targeted. Some movies are just for fun to get away from realities. It was action packed and strong female and male leads without being to political. Give it a chance
" Satisfying for Reacher fans. Otherwise so-so flick.
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"I have read all the Reacher novels. I too was skeptical about Tom Cruise as Reacher. But in this second screen portrayal, I think Cruise did a much better job of growing into the role. Reacher comes to Virginia to meet Major Turner, whose voice he liked on the phone. He finds that she's been arrested for treason, and of course knows its bogus. This pretty much follows the book. Then the pursuit of the truth leads Reacher to beat up and kill a bunch of bad dudes working for this Army contractor.The acting by Cruise and Smulders as Turner was decent. Anyone expecting a deep mystery in this story would be disappointed. It was pretty clear who was bad and who was good. They brought in this girl would was allegedly Reacher's daughter. I remember the book had her live in LA, but in this version she was right there in Washington. I guess for simplicity. The film also made her a key target of the movie, I guess to add some drama? This plot helped show audiences that Reacher does care about people, whether he knows them or not, as long as they are the good guys.Stuff gets blown up, there are car chases and foot chases, and a lot of shooting and fights. If you like Reacher, this will give you what you wanted. Otherwise, it's not that deep a movie with a pretty simple plot that will leave you asking why people like this character. To answer that question - I suggest you read the books, which are far superior to these first two Reacher movies so far. Enjoy."
" Care in the making
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,9,"I don't know whether this review has a spoiler or not. This type of movie always has a partially happy ending. Sorry if I spoiled it. I voted ""9"" because so many scenes were gifts to the audience. They weren't vanities for the film-maker. They must know we're busy and life is crowded, so these folks waded in and told us a story. The cut corners on time and once or twice, even cut corners on logic, because it's a story, not an affidavit. I compare this film to a violent Moody Blues album from the higher consciousness days. ""Desolation! Creation! Illusion! Compassion! . . ."" These folks notice that ""It's urgent that our expensive art form should make maximum use of this short life time, these opportunities, these talents and equipment."" The story illustrated a real-life danger of big organizations. It was violent because unfortunately that story needs to be told too. The characters were so real that it worried me and sent me into thinking about focusing more, which rarely happens in a film. The characters didn't fall off the turnip truck and try to con us. And unlike this review, the film didn't include a scene that wasn't squeezed into sacredness with the care it was given. A lot of good movies are being made these days. I don't care much for the genre but this was a good film."
" Yikes! This movie was really, not good.
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,3,"I enjoyed the first movie and had high hopes. This sequel was not good. Lots of corny action and dialog. Rife with errors. Did they have a military consultant? An E1 could have pointed out most mistakes.The story, dialogue and action are way overdone and cheesy. This movie has been made a hundred times in the past, just under different titles."
" Excellent Excellent Excellent
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,10,Excellent sequel to follow up the original. Storyline is good. Acting is good. Action is brilliant.Highly recommend and strongly looking forward to the third installment. Wonderful script writing in showing a softer side to Jack while still being able to maintain his intensity. Tom Cruise has always been a great actor and considering he is shorter in stature than the original he makes up for any shortcomings.
" Done his Dash!!!
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,3,"Really, read the books, Jack is one burly man, tall, ex army, huge physique with an attitude... this is not Tom Cruise by any means. How many larger men (bigger than 5'7"" ) and better actors could there be in Hollywood... he is Pathetic, any man who has to stand on a bench to look taller in his movies just doesn't cut it with me. I've read every book and refuse to watch the movies cos he just doesn't match the character. Move him on and get someone who matches the profile. Too old and done his dash..."
" Cast a ""real"" Jack Reacher
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,6,"The movie is pretty decent but....Anyone who has read the books will be in pain the whole time. Reacher is 6'5"" tall, not 5'6"" tall (did they transpose this in casting?). Sorry Tom, you don't cut it. I think the Rock (die his hair blonde) would be perfect for this role. Or a host of other big actors."
" Has it moments but not as good as the first
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,6,"As I always enjoy watching Tom Cruise in films, this one was only a tad enjoyable with several flaws. Not as good as the first I say. Storyline was so so which the high point of the film wasn't really at the end. Chemistry between Tom Cruise's Character and Cobie Smulders' Character was sub par. Also acting from the TV actors was sub par as well.Let's start with those flaws first. TV actors with Film Actors and vice versa. While there are a handful of TV actors who can act portray different characters well and act well, there are still some who maintain the image they do on a TV series or film they are known for thus hard to see them acting in anything else. Cobie Smulders, known for playing Robin in 'How I met your mother', didn't fit the character she was playing. Not only did I kept seeing her Character ""Robin"", but also her character being a Major in the Military Police didn't fit her. Although she does star in The Avengers, for me it wasn't a strong point and only realised after checking her IMDb credits again. Aldis Hodge, known for starring in Leverage, was again sub par. There were a several scenes with both I reckon the TV stars could of acted differently. Robert Knepper, known for starring in Prison break, While I have seen him in other series and movies, he is an actor that doesn't maintain his character from Prison Break which is good to see him in it although his time was short. Directing was only sub par. Fight scenes were a bit slow and camera work all over the place and sometimes hard to see due to dark area and lighting from background gets in the way. Overall, I give this 6/10. If you just want a thriller action and don't mind a weak plot, then give this ago. Movie like this really should've had someone else cast as Jack Reacher and went straight to netflix."
" Nominative Determinism at its Finest!
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,3,"It seems unfair to criticize a film for what it isn't, but in the case of Reacher 2, I must say that what is missing is the real heart and soul of Lee Child's original stimulus; leaving us, as an audience, with what is simply a generic, bare bones plot, containing one-dimensional characters and storytelling.With a more self-referential approach, the fact that this sequel is the 18th book in the long-running literary saga, may not pose such a problem (a la James Bond's 'Skyfall' or BBC's hit show 'Sherlock'; each which contain fun, knowledgeable insights and trivia which can be enjoyed by hyperactive fanatic and casual fan alike; but all geared to enhance the core components of story, but more importantly, character) and may actually provide a much less-arduous experience. With a more meta approach, key idiosyncrasies (such as Cruise's physical stature, some wooden acting etc.) would be far less glaring."
" I enjoyed it - - but - -
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,6,"...I had just finished the book that morning and watched the movie in the afternoon. There were parts of the book that I was unclear of so I was looking forward to viewing it to get some ""closure"" if you will.Both good but both very different as much as they do share similarities .Samantha, for example, and again just my opinion, played a more major role in the movie. Went on the plane with them and much more. It's ""good"" to see Jack thinking about could this actually be his child and how his feelings are moved that if so, he should have been there all these years for her. I would have enjoyed seeing more of the books version. For me, as I had said both good, I would not read a Jack Reacher book that was going to be made into a movie. Hey, who am I? If it's OK with Lee Childs, OK by little ol' me too"
" parenthood pains for Jack Reacher
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,5,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is the kind of movie which I would probably have never seen unless I was on a trans-Atlantic flight, too tired to read but still sleepless, and prisoner of the Lufthansa movie list. I mildly admire Tom Cruise (mainly for past achievements, past meaning from another millennium) and I have no special rejection of action movies provided they make sense and offer something more than gun or fist fights and car races. So I went for this film, the result could have been worse, but also much better.Director Edward Zwick took a few ambitious themes in the past, with mixed results. Glory may have been his ... moment of glory, but then followed The Last Samurai, Blood Diamond, and Defiance - all very ambitious projects but only partial successes. Here his ambitions are much lower, as Jack Reacher: Never Go Back is the second in a series which tends to be quite repetitive - wild action with corrupt military portrait-ed as the bad guys and one (or even more) ladies in distress to help. An extra element is added here - Reacher may or may not be the father of one of the ladies to be saved and spared any pain at any cost. Not a very original story, to be candid.What are we left with? A well made violent action movie and a moralistic story that seems even less credible than the amount of fist-beaten bad guys that are badly damaged during the screening time. The talent (and the price paid to enroll it) of Tom Cruise are not well spent here."
" Back for more
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,6,"Man, I really didn't think ""Jack Reacher"" would get a sequel, but I'm happy it did. It's a good franchise fit for Tom Cruise, even if ""Never Go Back"" doesn't quite live up to the excitement of the original - from the fight scenes right down to the pacing. And it's padded with a family drama that doesn't bear much of an emotional weight. But I like this character, which is why I'm fully behind this series. he's a guy who's mentally one step ahead of the opposition, and whoever s behind a given criminal conspiracy, Reacher's *going* to find them. The sequel seems to coast on this, but it's still a great angle. 6/10"
" Never Try to Be Clever
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,3,"The big reveal at the end, that Reacher isn't generic action girl's father, is ridiculous.""See that woman over there?"" She filled his coffee three times. He didn't know her, and she didn't know him. She was GAG's mother. So Reacher is not the father.Um, excuse me. Why didn't mom say hello to her daughter? The story with Reacher's non daughter is unnecessary except for setting up the final fight. There were better ways to get to the final Reacher vs bad guy muscle fight.Otherwise, the movie is decent - decent action, decent crime solved by Reacher.Note that it's the police in the beginning and the military folks who are the bad guys. With Hollyweird, of course it can't be the illegals or the mad Muslim terrorists."
" A real letdown
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,3,"Sorely disappointed by this Cruise vehicle. Story might have been OK with better writing – I mean, few men can get away with using the term 'Bitch Slap' unless it is in jest. For a woman? Ridiculous does not begin to cover it. A woman should never try and show more testosterone than the male lead  especially when he is feared and revered throughout the armed forces. Then there's the endless bad guys who are everywhere and know everything – and only a lowly female sergeant is there for help. Maybe the rest of the heroine's subordinates were men who hated her guts. Tom had the same persona as in the original, but that's where the similarity ends. Like too many movies and sequels, the movie relies on action instead of characters. I don't foresee a third Jack Reacher movie"
" 4/10 A hard act to follow
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,4,"OK so the sleeper hit Jack Teacher was so good that some studio head thought he or she could make a few more bucks by putting out an inferior follow up and all encounters would fall for it . That's how things were done in the old days but at over £10 a go people deserve more . This never really got off the ground the only thing that was interesting to watch was Major Turner she lightened up the screen providing eye candy for both men and women whilst providing a strong female role . The plot was dubious though slightly believable . Government hires dodgy contractor , lots of people get killed . Not very original . The best part was seeing Jack Reacher showing a tiny bit of emotion with his is she / isn't she his daughter . An average film not worth seeing , I hope they make a JR3 but actually write a decent script and make a decent film and anyone with a ticket for JR2 is allowed to go in for free !"
" Silly, formulaic and full of errors - but entertaining enough
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,5,"I watched this on a transatlantic flight because...well, I had seven hours to kill and from the snippets I saw on a fellow-passenger's screen, it looked like it could be entertaining enough.And you know what? It kinda was. Of course, it's utter tosh - but so is any action movie if you want to be picky. I found that I had less patience with some of the obvious goofs (such as a professional killer not being able to notice Reacher approaching his car, even though he is plainly looking straight at him AND is supposed to be staking the guy out; and a credit card not having been 'blocked' by its well-heeled card holder, several days after it has been stolen inside a handbag) than with how authentic and believable it was as a whole.Did the movie leave me wishing that I could have the last two hours of my life back? No, I can't say it did. But then I WAS on a flight with nothing else to do - and if I had paid good money to watch this at a cinema, I would probably have regretted it."
" 'Strong guys don't hurt you, the weak guys do that.'
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,7,"British author Lee Child returns with another installment in his popular JACK REACHER SERIES and with a screenplay adaptation by Marshall Herskovitz, Richard Wenk and director Edward Zwick they have made another successful espionage thriller for Tom Cruise.The plot is complex and has been well outlined as follows: 'After accomplishing the assignment of dismantling a human trafficking organization, the former military and drifter Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) goes to Washington to invite his liaison Major Susan Turner (Cobie Smulders) to have dinner with him. However, he meets her substitute Colonel Sam Morgan (Holt McCallany) who explains that Major Turner has been arrested and accused of espionage. Jack seeks out her veteran lawyer Colonel Bob Moorcroft (Robert Catrini) who explains that Major Turner has also been accused of the murders of two soldiers in Afghanistan. Further, he also tells that Jack is being sued, accused by a woman of being the father of her fifteen year-old daughter Samantha (Danika Yarosh). When Moorcroft is murdered, Jack is accused of being the killer and sent to a prison. He sees that Turner and he have been framed and also that Turner will be killed by two assassins. However he rescues her and they flee; soon they realize that there is a conspiracy involving military people from the army and a government contractor that is a powerful arm dealer. Jack also learns that Samantha is in danger and Turner and he rescue her. They decide to protect her since a skilled assassin (Patrick Heusinger) is hunting them down while they try to find the motive of the conspiracy. Who can be trusted?'It is all action, incredible feats of daring, massive violence, and the usual load of explosions, fires and car chases. But that is what these Jack Reacher films are all about. Cruise pulls it off and the supporting cast, while basically unknowns, provide fine backup. It is what it is. And there is a cliffhanger of sorts that will likely mean more Jack Reacher movies are in the works."

",2017-02-07 00:00:00,4,"The film was good but seriously what is the purpose of the title?NEVER GO BACK, Why? And then there's this father-daughter issue that was never a good plot in an action film. The action was GOOD, but the film was not GOOD. What is the meaning?The action was GOOD; we cannot remove that from Tom Cruise, he is good at this. But the film was not Good; The plot is flat, means it's normal and was already been used to many films. The never go back title also doesn't apply, never go back but the half of the film was filmed outside his city. There is a major who cannot fight, a daughter that was not seriously needed and was not really his daughter."
" A Disappointing Jack Reacher Film From Tom Cruise
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,4,"Is Tom Cruise probably now approaching the downward slope of his career?No,I am not saying that.I am saying that a film that has him alone is no longer enough to make money.He needs to make sure he will release a high quality film that plays to his advantage as a megastar for people to flock into theaters to watch him. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back now attests to that.Although it was reported that this film earned $160 million world-wide,it definitely was not enough for what his movie usually makes like Mission Impossible:Rogue Nation which earned more than $682 million world- wide.For non-Tom Cruise fans, they know and will readily admit that he is a limited actor who can only act a certain highly self-confident charismatic character.Nothing more.That is why he is practically the same charismatic character all throughout his film career whether he is a criminal Vincent in Collateral,a bartender Brian in Cocktail,a lawyer Mitch McDeere in The Firm and even the bald Les Grossman in Tropic Thunder.Cruise needs to be in the right material with the right people for many to flock to the theaters.Credit him to be able to do that in the last 30+ years of his career.Unfortunately,he comes across to this movie entitled Jack Reacher:Never Go Back,then it becomes somewhat a disaster.Apparently,playing Jack Reacher is not among his strongest repertoire as he has to show more of being a tough guy that everyone should fear rather than the women would love to sleep with. Even his small stature is against him in playing a physically dominant role. Aside from Cruise,I think that this film came up really short in terms of story and action scenes.Director Edward Zwick unfortunately made a film that played more or less to Cruise's weaknesses rather than strength as an actor such as his small stature that is presenting a tough guy image rather than charisma and less entertaining story that is full of clichés and predictability.Overall,Zwick and future directors must learn how to handle Cruise as an actor for better Jack Reacher sequels ahead in the future if they intend to make another one."
" Solid sequel
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,7,"Plot; Former military investigator Jack Reacher teams up with a Major framed for espionage.I found the first Jack Reacher film to be a refreshingly simple, meat and potatoes action throwback. Tom Cruise may not be the 6'6"" death machine portrayed in the novels, but he gives the character a slow burn attitude that makes up for it. The sequel has a larger canvas, but it still maintains much of the original's meat and potatoes approach. Along for the ride this time are the insanely beautiful Cobie Smulders, holding her own beside Cruise's Reacher, and a talented up and comer in Danika Yarosh. The latter is involved in a side/subplot that gives the whole thing some nice emotional purchase."
" B-grade sequel to an A-grade movie
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,3,"Wow - talk about underwhelming. The first Jack Reacher film was one of the most intelligent action-thrillers in a long time. This was largely because of the A-list talent supporting Tom Cruise like writer- director Christopher McQuarrie, and actors like Rosamund Pike, Richard Jenkins and David Oyelowo. Even Jai Courtney did his part well and the addition of Werner Herzog was inspired. The opening scene of the first movie was near magical.Now we come to Jack Reacher: Never Go Back, the pathetic sequel. You don't need to watch the movie to know it's pathetic - just take a look at the folks around Tom Cruise this time. The director now is Ed Zwick - not terrible, he did make The Last Samurai and Blood Diamond which were good for what they were: socio-politically charged action films. But Zwick can't do much in the Reacher territory. He tries to half-heartedly bring in a larger, systemic problem to the fray as he has done before but he hopelessly flounders. Acting alongside Cruise this time are b-list actors like Cobie Smulders, Robert Knepper (the annoying, one-note, racist from Prison break) and an annoying 15- year old girl who looks 20.Think about that for a second - from Werner Herzog, we moved to Robert Knepper. That's how bad this sequel is. It's an affront to the Jack Reacher brand created by the first film. There is no compelling mystery in the film, I'm not even entirely sure if I remember the insipid plot all that much. Calling it forgettable would be a kindness.Look - if you really have nothing better to watch on a night you're staying in, then put this on. You're not going to remember it later and it may even annoy you because of how bad it is compared to the first film - but there's a reason I'm rating it 3 stars and not 1."
" A really bad, boring, dumb, predictable action movie.
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,2,"When you see Tom Cruise's name on some action movie poster, and even you are convinced that you like good adult cinema, you can be tempted to go watch it on a Saturday evening. Expecting some good thrilled story like MI5 for example, I had to watch this tedious story, full of boring characters and common places. I think they were after some Bourne smart and mysterious script but ended up with a movie about bad (very bad) guys who are ugly by nature, and cute (Tom Cruise is getting old tough) good witty guys. The teenager kid is so badly built as character as some unexplained dialogues across all the movie. The structure is the conventional an predictable one, with the usual twists and ridiculous tricks. The first film was a little better..."
" The Vidiot Reviews...
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,5,"Jack Reacher: Never Go BackThe biggest difference between municipal police and military police is that the latter shoots unarmed Muslim men. Surprisingly, all ammunition in this action-thriller is aimed solely at a middle-aged Caucasian.While helping out an old army buddy (Cobie Smulders) suspected of killing two officers in Afghanistan, former major-cum-transient Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) ends up accused of murder himself.Now, the pair must elude an assassin who doesn't want their employer's secret arms ring exposed. But Reacher's search for an eyewitness is cut short when his estranged daughter is used as bait. Lacking the shrewd acting, gritty action and whip-smart dialogue that made the original adaptation of Lee Child's literary bruiser so enjoyable, this second-rate sequel suffers from a laughable villain, an awkward romance and a paternal sub-plot that serves little purpose.Moreover, if you are ever accused of a crime by the army, remember to blame everything on the drone.

" Not as good as you would expect.
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,7,"After four years from the first movie, Its not as good as you would expect in a squeal from Edward Zwick or Tom Cruise. This been the tom cruise's first squeal apart from the mission impossible franchise, obviously viewers would expect more. Anyways its not bad either; must say highly enjoyable and i quite enjoyed, but could have been better. Its good to see tom cruise returns as Jack Reacher, but i would still prefer the first feature. Anyways if you are fan of tom cruise you certainly will not be disappointed. If you are a fan of Edward Zwick's work you would say this lacks a little of his touch because their collaboration on Last Samurai (2003) was exceptional and was nominated for four Academy Awards."
" All that is wrong with Hollywood
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,2,"I was looking forward to the movie. I was sorely disappointed. What I saw was the same clichéd, vapid story-line that has been made a thousand times in Hollywood.Let me lay it out for you. 1. The protagonist is hard, distant, anti-social 2. The co-star is eye candy and can't do it all on her own 3. The side story does everything she can... everything you expect and predict she will do to get everyone killed. 4. In the end, the protagonist has to face off single-handedly against the bad guy, even though the co-star is just above them with a weaponThe last half hour of this movie could have been left out and a disclaimer put on the screen saying ""You already know how this is going to end, so we won't bother"". How many times did the stars walk around weapons they could have picked up and used? Case in point, when the costar choked out the bad guy with a garden hose, she ran right past him and didn't grab his gun. For that matter, why were these two not carrying the whole time?How many times did the costar try to hammer someone on the head with the bottom of her fist, only to get thrown across the room? Why did it take forever for the costar to make it to help the star at the end when she was just above where he fell with a handgun right there?I'm just glad I didn't go to the theater to see this film. Instead, I rented it online for a third of the price (still too much). Hollywood is so over."
" The Best Jack Reacher Movie So Far
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Jack Reacher (Tom Cruise) tries to help Major Turner (Cobie Smulders) who has been arrested for selling government secrets to the enemy. Later he learns that a paternity suit is filed against him and that he has a daughter, Samantha (Danika Yaroush) who is 15- years old. We know that Jack Reacher is a one-man army and has no ties to anyone or anything. Yes, we see exceptional choreography within these hand-to-hand and gun fights, but this time things slow down some and we see something different and it is welcomed. This is probably the best Jack Reacher movie ever, mostly because there is more humanity in here and we like the banter between Jack and Samantha, who doesn't know that Jack may be her father. But before all that can take place we see Jack arrested, escape, arrested again this time for murder, but this time he escapes with the arrested Major Turner. He learns Samantha is in danger and goes to her. All three are now on the run in New Orleans trying to figure out why Major Turner was arrested in the first place. Hey, I did miss hearing any Cajun music. Bummer. Notables: Aldis Hodge as Espin a military police Captain who also needs to re-capture Major Turner; Patrick Heusinger as The Hunter, a former soldier who keeps tracking Jack; Robert Knepper as General Harkness the owner of Parasource the company that provides additional security in Afghanistan. I suppose one of the reasons I like this more than the other Jack Reacher movies is because this was a more complete story. We enjoyed the banter between Jack and Major Turner and Jack and Samantha. Hey, what's not to like? So is Jack Reacher Samantha's father? You know I can't tell you that. Stop asking. (I need to know) (8/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."
" What a disappointment
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,1,"I usually like Tom Cruz's movies, but this one is totally disjointed and not cohesive in any way. The character development and relationship between characters were not developed enough to care about them or their goals. It was totally rushed and badly written. The acting was awful, Tom didn't even seem to care about the film because even his acting was bad. There are a few plots that are rushed and pointless. It feels like a quick movie they pumped out and make money. It felt low budget and poorly directed. Parts of it didn't make sense and scenes didn't follow well. The music and sounds effects were weak, it was just the worst Cruz film I've ever seen. I think Tom Cruz even looks into the camera once by accident and it was just bad."
" Very entertaining and I liked this quite a bit. A great action movie that I recommend even though its a little one note film
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,7,"""Welcome back to the army Major. You're under arrest."" After high level officials are found dead the government zeros in on one suspect, Jack Reacher (Cruise). When he realizes the next target is Major Turner (Smulders), who has also been falsely accused the two escape custody and become fugitives. Now, with only the truth on their side, they must find a way to avoid capture and death and try to clear their names. First of all this is a very exciting and entertaining movie. It's been awhile since I've seen the original so it's not fair to compare the two, but I remember liking the first one and I really enjoyed this one. The action is relentless, there is an actual story and the drama really helps move the movie along in a way that enhances the overall excitement. If there is a negative thing I can say about this it would be that, much like the Bourne movies, the main character seems almost invincible and you never really feel like he is in any type of danger at all. He can punch a car window, fall off a roof or take on a group of men at once and it never feels like he is in danger. That takes a little of the realism away, but then again, it does work in a movie like this. Overall, very entertaining and I liked this quite a bit. A great action movie that I recommend even though its a little one note film. I give this a B."
" Really bad
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,5,"I rate as objectively as possible, but trying to point out qualities that stand out, regardless of how I felt overall about the movies. Unfortunately, this film stands out by absolutely nothing good. Instead, it feels almost like a formulaic parody of action movies made by the Wayans: insulting.Again Jack Reacher is Tom Cruise, an intense ex military thug that can handle any situation by kicking ass. Fortunately for him, the movie only puts him in those kind of situations, so he's safe. Again he must save the girl, only that being part 2, he must save two girls: the romantic interest and the possible daughter.Forget that the romantic interest is of the age his daughter would probably be and that the daughter is there almost for comic relief only. What feels really insulting is how cartoonish are all the characters. Reacher is handling everything with his hands, even in gun fights. The woman is always getting kicked around for him to save and in the rare situations when she does handle herself she uses weapons and kills people in passionate anger. The daughter is a stupid arrogant teen who could have been safe a number of times in the movie, only she had to text or call or use stolen credit cards to put herself in danger. The bad henchman is a typical sadistic villain, with no real motivation or story. And the evil mastermind... let's just say that all of Robert Knepper's scenes were painful.Add to this the stupid plot, the moronic editing of the scenes and the mechanical nature of the direction and you get a 100% formulaic movie that satisfies no one and piles insult upon insult on movie makers, the military, airport security, women, men and viewers alike.Avoid this film."
" A mediocre movie
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,4,"The good thing about Jack Reacher - Never Go Back is that Tom Cruise looks the best among all his recent movies. Unfortunately, that is not a criteria for us to survive a nearly 2 hrs movie.I will not talk about the story (there is hardly any). Makers of the movie should have spent more time improving the story. Action sequences are really dull. They try to look Jason Bourne like, but end up looking totally mediocre. Probably a short TV Series is best suited for such stories.Hopefully, there will be a 3rd part to this series and hopefully, that will be worth the wait."
" Jack doesn't disappoint
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,7,"Let me start that I have not read any of the books Jack Reacher series is based on. I will review the movie only on its own merit. All I can say that the story was engaging with good amount of suspense. The story may have been slightly simplified but after all this is entertainment and you can only cram so much detail into two hour movie. Acting was believable and the action scenes were as always very well done. Both my wife and daughter who typically don't like this genre were watching it without any complains. If you like this movie genre you won't be disappointed. I would give the movie 6.8-7.0 Story is engaging, action well scripted and acting well done."
" A very disappointing sequel...
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,2,"AtJack Reacher Never Go Back...there's only one way to describe this film and that is a waste of time I can't believe looked forward to watching this it was one of my most anticipated of 2016 when I saw the trailer it looked awesome just dynamic and action packed but I was wrong this is not what I expected I was really let down it was such a disappointment and there was hardly any action the whole time they were just running from the people who had framed them it wasn't clear for what they were just running from some bad guy and it was unclear why he was after them why he wanted them dead. I mean it's not the actors it's the script and the film itself I give it credit for the acting Tom Cruise is good as Jack Reacher and so is Cobie Smulders as Major Susan Turner but the story was bad,the writing was bad everything else was just bad I really wouldn't recommend this even if you're a fan of the original which I am this is Hollywood trash but they will keep making films like this because there will always be an audience for it I'm just glad I didn't pay to see this in theaters which I was going to but in the end decided against it I really have never been happier that I didn't do that don't waste your time watch a good action/thriller film instead I use that term loosely because like I said hardly any action and wasn't thrilling."
" Very, very disappointed
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,3,"I am very, very disappointed. Movie is incredibly boring and, I may say, incredibly stupid.Plot. OMG! Even a child could do a better story. Everything was already seen in hundreds of movies. Every cliché possible in 2h. Really, every part of the story is lame or illogical. For example: They go to some internet cafe trying to log in some military db, over, and over, and over, with the same username and password giving bad guys enough time to find them. Seriously? You escape military prison and then try to log into db with YOUR username and password??? Acting. Terrible. Worst acting in high budget movie I've ever seen. Why does everybody have their faces like they have eaten something bad? Looking angry (looks more like they really have to go to the bathroom) all the time does not mean that you are extraordinary tough or smart. Tom did his job bearable but everyone else are just annoying.Visual effects. Bad. Not worst but plain bad. At least for this kind of movie.Action scenes. Extremely bad. About every high budget action movie in the last 5 years is better.Bottom line... Bad movie!"
" PG13 for the children
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,3,"This movie would have the potential to be entertaining, if it were geared towards adults and not children or feminists (which are the same thing)How bout a nice unrated cut, with some blood, cursing, and boobs? Not to be mistaken for: 'politically correct speech', 'politically correct violence against males only mostly white', 'cock shots' which somehow are sneaking into pg-13 titles lately...No? Okay. My money says it's not good enough to be spent on this. Somebody spent millions though... hope it was a good return... Maybe you should cater to your target audience and not twitter trolls.Gave it a 3 for featuring government conspiracy and a white male protagonist being the victim of a government conspiracy; finally a bit of realism in the femiNAZI driven Hollywood."
" Mission possible!!!
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,7,"I have always been a Tom Cruise fan and he does not disappoint in this sequel.Even though the story line and plot is nothing new, it still manages to capture one's attention.The characters are very believable and the on screen chemistry is very touching. They're a few scenes i need to re watch when the movie becomes available on DVD, for example how Reacher is able to punch through car windows without breaking his hand and apparently it's very easy to buy airplane tickets with stolen credit cards.I still enjoyed the first movie much more however this one was able to provide a few good laughs, I also enjoyed the fact that the action is not over stylized. In my opinion I felt the movie needed another ten more minutes to explore the relationship between Reacher and the girl, this could be used in a follow up film (hint, hint)"
" terrible rerun - boring
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,4,"I liked the first movie, and I was hoping this would be close to as good. I like Tom Cruise a lot more now than his dumb Top Gun movie days.But this movie just tanked. It tried to make him interesting, but it was just flat boring, and he did not demonstrate any intelligence. Mostly just grunted and responded with one word. There wasn't any romance either, c'mon Tom, don't you kiss women anymore? Are you sad about George Michael or what?I watched Assassins Creed last week, geese I am 0 or 2 on action movies. They both sucked!"
" Pointless movie
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,4,Its a movie that don't have more then Tom Cruse walking about it never get to be a action movie like i hoped so the Never Go in the title felt like the part you should listen to. Maybe Tom is feeling to old so he wants to slow down what happens in Jack Reacher: Never Go Back with i guess i can understand he is 55years old now. But it don't work his movies need action and bullets flying bombs going off for them to be interesting like Mission impossible and Edge of Tomorrow.See he have 2 movies coming in 2017 hope they are better and more action then this movie.
" Yet another novel ruined
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,1,"If the first tragedy of a Jack Reacher movie wasn't enough, they made this one. If you don't factor in that Tom (joke of an actor) Cruise doesn't even remotely resemble how Jack Reacher is described in the novels, quite simply the butchering of the story should tell you what a horrible mistake this movie is. The only thing that even tells you it was based on a great book was the names of the characters and the base story. If you read the book and are a fan DO NOT watch this movie. It will make you sad. My prejudice aside against the hack of an actor Cruise, the way the twist the book to hardly resemble it at all is just bad form. I am disappointed in Lee Child for letting this happen. I had to give it a chance since I love the books, but at this point I might have to give the books up just because. If seems all Lee cares about is the money now. I think he used to love writing but I guess greed wins over in the end. Because as and I can't state this enough this WAS NOT A JACK REACHER movie."
" Dismal
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,3,"First I would like to say I am both an avid reader of Lee Child's novels and a watcher of Tom Cruise's movies. In fact I have all of Mr. Child's books and most of Tom Cruise's films. But a major mistake was made here. Mr. Child is not Fyodor Dostoevsky, Charles Dickens or even John Steinbeck. People read his stories because of and only because of, the protagonist, Jack (no middle name) Reacher. The plot is superfluous, the story line is incidental and quite often inane like the lives most of us are living. We read them because we dream about being Reacher, a 6'5"", 250 pound hulk with hands the size of frozen turkeys who wanders around America owning nothing and wanting nothing other than to right wrongs. Mr. Child is good at character development and his fans are intimately aware of Reacher's answer to most problems. He hits them, hard, once. And we love the vicarious thrills it brings.But then someone noticed the popularity of the books and Tom Cruise bought the movie rights thinking the stories would be a great vehicle for his 5'7"" pretty boy physique. Wrong! I watched the movie and looked for Reacher. He wasn't in the movie so I tried to get immersed in the story line but it was shallow and inconsequential like most of Mr. Child's books. That doesn't matter, we read them because we want to read about Reacher not to be enthralled by the prose. It failed on both Reacher and the story. I am waiting for someone to cast the right person as Reacher. My vote is for Dave Bautista or Dwayne Johnson. He doesn't have to be an Oscar winning actor he just has to put one foot in front of the other, figure out what's wrong and hit the bad things."
" Disappointing
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,3,"This was a new series Ithought I was going to like but i was wrong. This movie is nothing like the first one, it is long, predictable and boring. The military characters are cheesy and laughable. I might have enjoyed this in 1996. The female lead was annoying, I had had enough of that character after the first five minutes and had to put up with her till the end! The younger girls character seemed thrown in there like an after thought. That whole plot line made me vomit. Honestly, i fell asleep and watched the last 45 min while riding my stationary bike the next morning. Don't waste your time, watch Jack Reacher, the first one, again."
" Great entertainment from Cruise as always
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,10,"Great entertainment,OK let's stop the complaining about the character and how Cruise doesn't fit the same mold as the character in the terrific books by Lee Child. The only man or actor that could have ever lived up to the depiction physically and had the presence and quality described in the books was John Wayne in the fifties, incidentally, a far more limited actor than Cruise but also a man that always consistently delivered an entertaining movie. This guy's movies are always great entertainment and more than that movies that you watch repeatedly. Almost everyone has at least one Tom Cruise film they've seen multiple times and this film is no exception. The supporting cast, the fight scenes, the plot Watch it, you'll enjoy"
" Jack Is Back
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,7,"Plenty of action and has just enough of the plot from Books to keep avid fans guessing. Acting very good but as usual script has several holes. Guess they want too squeeze too much action in which leaves little time for character development.Tom Cruise rocks as Jack even though his size makes you doubt his ability to pull off performances compared to book character. Mainly because we've seen him do well in other action flicks, it's believable and exciting.Good: Character remains true to book and fans can enjoy the plot even with questionable writing.Reacher justice continues to keep us appreciating him even if he breaks most of laws he used to enforce as a MP.Keep fans wanting another film with action scenes and similarities from books.Bad: Everyone else around main characters made to appear clueless, incompetent or just foolish. Audiences don't need this to appreciate skills of main characters.Jack has critical info needed with no clue how he got it. Must be osmosis the way he knows all the phone numbers he needs, locations, etc. I know it is boring details but at least show us something."
" Never come back
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,1,"Let me start off by saying that I am a fan of Tom Cruise from his Mission: Impossible days. I love the guy and he knows that he has a huge fan following but I think he should be a bit more sensitive about it. If you're gonna milk the fandom too hard, you will end up destroying the love that you have and also end up stereotyping yourself. He is good as Ethan Hunt and that's it. He should do that and make other movies that will suit his age. Sorry, I have to admit that Tom Cruise is getting old. SCREENPLAY - I have just started to understand the craft of film- making and as I always say, it's hard. Assigning an aspect of the movie with an adjective is very insulting, but when the writers do not respect the audience by presenting something coherent and interesting, I think an adjective is necessary. So in order to define the narrative, horrendous will do. The dialogue is just juvenile at best. I vaguely remember the 1st Jack Reacher movie. It wasn't any masterpiece, but it wasn't as slow-paced as this one. I understand that they are dealing with more sub-plots and that needs some slowing down, but at what cost? It just becomes plain boring.DIRECTION - Just remember what I said about my respect for film- making and then judge me. That said, the direction was like walking 100 kilometres through mud. Just dragging on and on. The camera-work was so monotonous. The pacing was completely off. There was no tension. There was literally nothing to help me get invested. Just glaring plot- holes staring right at me. I almost became CinemaSins. I actually found a new sense of respect for CinemaSins because what he does needs a lot of patience. Wait a second, Edward Zwick has directed The Last Samurai, Love and other Drugs and Pawn Sacrifice. I love all three of them and now this? Well, miracles do happen, be it good or bad. Bad in this case surely. There was also that awful CGI. It was pretty distinguishable all the time.ACTING - Well, when the screenplay and direction has failed you, what can the actors do? Tom Cruise ( and I say this with a heavy heart) gave a very wooden performance. I think he was trying to be serious and not be Ethan Hunt. It wasn't working. That is because there are no character arcs. Nothing about the character was established from the previous movie that could have been worked into this movie. So he just ended up an impression of Hunt. Cobie Smulders was okay at best. She looked tired for some reason. Again, no character arcs and that didn't allow me to connect with her character traits. Everyone, and I do mean everyone, were just clichéd characters that you see in movies like Taken. FINAL VERDICT - I haven't read the book, but if it's good then stick to it. Give a pass on this movie. It's certainly not worth the effort and if you know or are in contact with Tom Cruise, just tell him to choose wisely from next time."
" Not good enough
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,6,"Unfortunately this 6 out of 10 goes only for Tom's part in the film. What's wrong with this movie, is that they changed the main characteristic that had the first movie. It's like they tried to change a great recipe.Jack Reacher was a bad guy with no sentiment at all and comes back as a good guy who is in love with a woman, who wants to be a father and who even gets bitten up from time to time.In my opinion a very good movie who should not be named Jack Reacher 2. Anyway, I believe Tom Cruise is the real deal and his worst movie is way above average."
" Top there of my worsts list
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,3,"There is no subject, no integrity... They only make a movie for spend money. What a shame for Tom. I believe don't waste time with that movie. Movie is starting with no understanding, at the moment, there is happening some action but you can only watch actions, impossible you can't understand what happening and why happening than Aka Robin from How I met your mother, she goes prison but again you can't understand and she said, I don't want to see Jack because he try to catch me from prison, keep that mind, they are not met yet :D Than we are learning Jack has a daughter but Jack doesn't not that yet. :D Fellas, please do not watch that movie. Go run, walk or something."
" One word; Average
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,5,"Overall: This movie is just average and I cannot really recommend it. Maybe one night... in the background at a party... while your drunk.Good: The action was actually pretty good and Jack Reacher's witty persona, which I enjoyed in the first movie, is back! Tom Cruise's performance was surprisingly very mixed. He had some good moments and some terrible moments. For his calibre of actor, that is very disappointing. The villains were massively improved with the assassin/ex-military guy providing a fierce competition for Reacher with Robert Knepper as the cool, collected leader. Literally the only improvement over the first one sadly. Bad: Very surprisingly, Tom Cruise's acting was sub par for frequent sections of the movie. All the rest of the acting was just on par with his at these moments. Nothing impressed me or made me even care. The humour in this movie felt so forced and just didn't flow like in the original. It worked in the original because it felt like it worked and wasn't overdone. In this movie however, it is overdone, over exaggerated and overly stupid. Providing a love interest for Reacher(whether that be in the original books I do not care) and his 'child' was so god damn moronic it made me want the villains to catch her. The movie never gave me an excuse to comprehend caring about any characters and I honestly wouldn't have flinched if everyone died. ​ Speaking of his child and lover, this movie nails a string of clichés such as: 'Girl and Guy hate each other at first', 'child runs over to hug parent after leaving', 'bad guys nearly always miss', 'bad guy targets heroes family' and so many more. It is annoying that this movie is done so lazily and, compared to the original which I actually enjoyed, it just went down in pretty much every way. The cinematography was also lazy and contained too many stupid shots and shaky cam. The music was there and didn't affect me in anyway what so ever. Also the decent bits of the movie were in the trailer.Best Part: The action scene at the end of the movie.MVP: Patrick Heusinger(maybe?) as the assassin hunting them down5/10"
" Jack Reacher Character killed
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,3,"Dear Mr. Cruise,As a number 1 fan of the Lee Child novels I will not go into the physical miss-match between you and the character described in the books. I even applaud your performance portraying Jack in the first movie. However I have major issues with this installment. Yes the book is always better and it's very difficult to match and keep a movie enjoyable. The plot and overall story line do follow the book and it makes for an enjoyable movie (Hence a 3, not a 1). However what I really don't like is how Jack is portrayed here. Next to none of his investigative skill nor his wit (lest one scene where Jack is interrogated) or his ability to put down anyone in a hand to hand combat situation, is used here. There is even a person who is probably better at hand to hand combat than him. Only luck made it possible for Jack to win in the end and he certainly did not get out unscathed. In doing this the Jack Reacher character is, in my opinion, killed. I am very disappointed and sincerely hope you and the script writers will do better next time!Best regardsJohan"
" Should not have gone back
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,5,"I really enjoyed the first one, and I was excited to see this one. And ... it started off disappointing, and stayed there. The previews showed us the diner scene, and that was ... it. That was the entire scene. No, we didn't get the fight. No action at all. We didn't have any lead up to the sheriff, as it was all just an intro. The whole movie just felt like a lot of not-really connected stories with one common character.A lot of the scenes felt forced. For instance, when Hardison (Leverage was a great show, and he will ALWAYS be Hardison to me) gets a shiner, he takes the cold compress off his face just to show the audience and make a tough guy statement, and then ... he's no longer bruised. Yeah ... us black folk DO bruise. And, I expected Aunt Robin to be a bit better at running and/or hiding from the police. Her character is supposed to be an MP, and they are supposed to be cops. Well, they ARE cops. And cops are supposed to be able to investigate things, because ... that's what cops do. So, her running through town in half of a military work uniform is just ... silly. Only to be followed up by the ""professional"" who almost gets runned over by a bus. A BUS. Looking both ways before you cross is definitely part of situational awareness. I'm sure it's in the manual somewhere, and if not ... it should be an addendum. I also expect covert operatives to NOT drive Maseratis, as they tend to stick out. The idea that two people can chase off a kitchen full of cooks tells me that someone never worked in a one before. Ain't no way that many cooks are leaving their station. If you swing a ladle at a cook, he will hit you with a meat tenderizer. Several times.The dialogue was extremely poor in parts. ""Sir, she's trying to access the system."" ... IT guys don't talk like that. And ... why does everyone call him Reacher? He's not even in the military, but when you are ... you still use first names when you are on a familiar basis with someone. It should be ""Jack"", or ""Mr. Reacher"". But ...This movie fell very short for me. I had high hopes after the first one, but this one failed to engage. I, now, have no interest in a third."
" Absolutely ridiculous but like a train wreck...
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,7,"First 2 minutes of the movie they've got Military Police arresting a County Sheriff. Impossible. Could not, would not, cannot happen. This is a hallmark of both Jack Reacher films and all of the Jack Reacher books. They know so little of how the US Army operates and they just don't care to research it. With that bit of trivia out of the way, and if you can get past the inaccuracies, it's a good little action movie. Tom Cruise may be a flake, but he hardly ever fails to make a tight, well-paced thriller and he doesn't disappoint in this one. It won't be winning any Oscars for best picture, but you most definitely will not be bored."
" A Failure
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,2,"This is not embarrassing but not entertaining either. It's not something you would want to keep your eyes on throughout.This is a failed experiment of ""Tom Cruise Productions."" Isn't that a clue? It feels like Tom Cruise, a moderately decent actor, decides that he can try and recreate the success of ""A Few Good Men,"" apparently all by himself; acting couldn't help but lag behind everything else because of a bad story and a worse script. This could not even repeat the, again, moderate entertainment of the first instalment.This is a very expensive failure of, hopefully, over-reaching and not vanity."
" Cruise is in fine form, but the movie is entirely forgettable and lacks the retro charm of its predecessor.
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,5,"The first ""Jack Reacher"" film, by Christopher McQuarrie, was a pleasant surprise. It was a retro, '70s-style action thriller in the vein of ""Dirty Harry"" with old-fashioned stunt work, tangible special effects (the car chase is one of the best in years and more ""Bullitt"" than ""Fast and Furious""), and a fun turn from Tom Cruise, who clearly relished being able to play an unapologetic bad ass - he's usually tasked with playing good guys who are so cookie-cutter American Hero that they would never spit dialogue such as telling their enemy that they wish to drink their blood from the bottom of their boot.The sequel, alas, is pretty generic. McQuarrie is gone, replaced by Edward Zwick, who at one time was fairly distinct behind the camera, but the aesthetic approach of ""Never Go Back"" is that of a TV movie. Devoid of the sleek noir vibe of McQuarrie's film, Zwick has fumbled the ball here.Most action films would be given props for having strong female leads. This happened in Cruise's awesome 2014 blockbuster, ""Edge of Tomorrow."" But Colbie Smulders isn't given much to work with here, and frankly, the entire appeal of these Reacher books (at least as far as I have been told by its avid readers) is that Reacher is the main protagonist. The movie mistakenly sidelines him in favor of a not-entirely-convincing dynamic shared by Reacher, Smulders, and a girl who may or may not be his daughter. The movie deserves credit for trying to create supporting characters, especially strong female roles; but they just aren't developed well enough for us to care, and since Cruise is so good in this role, whenever they are stealing screen time it really does become a bit frustrating. The movie isn't bad, per se. It's pretty much textbook mediocrity -- Cruise is great, he clearly loves playing this character and I'd be down for another serving with someone like McQuarrie back behind the camera, but unfortunately it's pretty clear that Zwick either wasn't given full creative control here and the studio cut his film to shreds -- or, conversely, was given too much freedom and didn't understand what made the character/previous film appealing to audiences. The result is a movie that just exists, destined to be played on late-night rotation on TNT and generate merchandise sales for the studio, but one that will never catch on with home video audiences the way the 2012 film did."
" Why so angry reviews?
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,8,"I'm a huge Reacher/Lee Child fan, and I enjoyed a lot the first installment with Tom Cruise. I read some other reviews for ""Never Go Back"", with some quite angry viewers claiming their ticket money back, annoyed about ""lack of explosions"", ""dull"" female- lead character, and so on. I read many Lee Child's Jack Reacher novels, including the one that INSPIRED (as noted in the opening credits) this movie. Yes, generally, Jack Reacher is a loner, an ex-MP guy with whom you don't want to mess too much. But, come on, the action is quite OK, the spirit of the book is there, the general action and suspense from the novel are present. I agree that there may exist some powerful sequels to the first movie (The Bourne series, for example), but there are also some lower ones (the James Bond movies after Casino Royale). So, let's wait. Tom Cruise miscast as Reacher? Why? Only because he's not physically like the character Lee Child imagined? The acting and directing matter more, I think. Acting? Very good, from Tom's part, at 54 climbing the roofs and being the center of the action. A stronger Turner character might've been a better choice but, we will see how it develops in movie #3 (if...). Directing? Not as fast-paced as #1. And the spirit of the Jack Reacher books deserve more. Maybe, the miscast is there. Still, 8 from me."
" Just Awful
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,1,"Your only hope of enjoying this movie is to have never read the book it's based on. Ironically, a big part of the movie's audience must be people who have read and enjoyed the book. They are in for a disappointment.What a world!P.S. IMDb is insisting my review cannot be a review unless it's at least 10 lines long. They threaten dire penalties if I cannot meet this goal. I was only able to watch about 10 minutes of the movie. Any more than that would have given me an ulcer. Even in that brief time, I could have thought of dozens of reasons why the movie was awful.However, I think I would rather just try to forget that I ever saw it. Nothing against Cruise, for those who may be on one side or the other. I disapprove of the casting choice, but that's not enough to ruin the movie for me. The problem is that they took an interesting story, with interesting characters, and turned it into a boring and stupid cartoon.Actually, most cartoons are better than this, so I really have nothing to compare it to that would help the potential viewer to understand how bad the movie is."
" Good entertainment
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,6,"I like Cruise. He takes acting so seriously. He is always trying hard to satisfy the cinema audience. The plot itself is not the best. But I liked how it established a plot development in which Jack Reacher got nearly convinced he might have a daughter. And how Cruise played this character who is getting acquainted to the idea of having a child. I was emotionally captured by the closing pictures, when the girl wants to embrace him - her ""might have been dad"" - but Jack stays confined and clueless before relaxing himself. All the believable emotion is played in a way that only Cruise can do. It is a pity that Cruise still gets underrated for his performances. He deserves that the critics take him seriously. With Jack Reacher Cruise has established a clever character. He might be able to come back to Reacher from time to time without need to stay young forever."
" Don't even go there in the first place - let alone go back
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,3,"""They Live"" - but without Roddy Piper, and with a lower caliber of acting.The final fight scene between Reacher and the Baddie is SO bad and SO overacted it's like watching an amateur WWE fight; in 1990; while sober; in your basement; while your mom does laundry.I don't understand the point of this attempted franchise: Washed up ex-military guy gets involved in military stuff despite constantly professing how ex-military he is; to help military personnel despite constantly professing how ex-military he is and and jumps on board the causes of people he doesn't know from Jack (that pun is actually better than the whole movie btw) - for absolutely no reason?? The Jack Reacher concept is a SINGLE ""made for TV"" movie at best - certainly not Bourne or Bond movie franchise worthy.Trust me, watch ""Basic"" instead - it has Sam Jackson and Giovanni Ribisi - is the same concept pretty much; has the same crap acting (Travolta and Nielson *shudder*) - but with the added benefit of having Rosalyn Sanchez in it throughout....."
" Turn off your brain and watch
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"7/10. Jack Reacher is back again, on the run to clear his name and uncover the truth. Directed by Edward Zwick who also did Blood Diamond (2006) and The Last Samurai (2003). He is back working with Tom Cruise again, and does a fine job. This is a popcorn movie that is just a bit of far fetched fun. Tom Cruise is good, and is up to his usual standards. His partner in crime Cobie Smulders is also fine, not much chemistry chemistry between them though. As I often say, if you want to turn off your brain and just see a fun action flick, then this is for you. I did enjoy it. Jack Reacher: Never Go Back #jackreachernevergoback"
" could have been better
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,5,"I am a big fan of the Jack Reacher book series. I was really exited to find out that movie was to be released based on book.Attention Spoilers!The first movie was not bad. I liked it. I was not quite fond of Tom Cruise playing a main role - beaning a bit shorter than described in book and a little less muscular. However first movie was good it was keeping me entertained.Than second one came out and I was excited to see it. After screening it left me so disappointed. The action scenes were good. However the plot not quite matching with original. I can understand that as the movie is ""based"" on book. What you see on screen is a bit silly - especially scenes where main characters are running. Looks like they a bit disorganized and just doing this cause they got military background. Also the actual events from book are scattered over the movie in no order. There is also no visible connection between the two main characters - something it was evident in book. Bringing alleged daughter of Reacher was done in very messy way. The other thing that bugs me is the villains. Beaning military trained they not making any effort to fight back. Apart from one main bad ass - which was actually not described like that in book. I know today Hollywood wants more actions,explosions and all the ""drama"" that they can squeeze, but there are certain limits. The original book was much better. It kept a reader on it's toes right to the end. Movie however was a mediocre if not forgettable. I think this is part of Tom Cruise being involved in production and his influence is visible from movies like Mission Impossible. Don't get me wrong he is a good, dedicated actor, but the second installment of Jack Reacher franchise was beyond his talent. Or maybe he was trying too much. If there will be a third movie based on book i would like it to be a bit more true to it, instead of being processed for a dumber audience. Or perhaps it needs a new actor for main role. Overall I give it 5 stars as it was not complete garbage."
" Nice Action but story wasn't great. Spoilers!
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,6,"Like all Tom Cruise films, the action is great. The first Jack Reacher and this one aren't connected meaning there in no link/mention of anything from the first film in this one. The story is basically Reacher finds out that Cobie Smulders character is in trouble or is set up and he's going to save her. Now what's cool about her character is that she's no damsel is distress, Cobie's character is a bad-ass like Maria Hill. Once Jack rescues her theirs this weird side story of Jack finding out he has a daughter and so he now has to protect a teenage girl and Cobie (sort of) because they are now on the run. The relationship between Cobie and Cruise is what I really enjoyed from the film plus the action/fight scenes/explosions. Overall I give the film a 6.5/10. I always love seeing Cobie Smulders on screen so maybe a little biased."
" Jack Reacher: Never Go Back (2016)
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,6,"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back I'm not going to lie, I enjoyed Jack Reacher in 2012. It had a nice complex-ish story mixed in nicely with good action and style. This made it an enjoyable popcorn flick. You can't ask for more from a film like this (and something with Tom Cruise). With all that in mind, I can't say the trailer for its sequel brought much excitement. Jack Reacher was always going to be a film series, it just seemed marketed that way. Its just a bit of a shame that the sequel does not live up to or succeed its predecessor in anyway.Jack is back, and this time he and Major Turner are on the run after being framed for espionage. While they try to clear their name a wise cracking 15 year old teen is thrown into the mix. Not very exciting. This film seems like a step backwards for a franchise that had a promising start. The original had a better cast, fight scenes, and was written in a way where you couldn't exactly tell what was going to happen (or maybe I just wasn't smart enough to figure it out). That's not the case here. This film treads ground that is all too familiar. You know exactly what's going to happen. The film seemed like The Fugitive but worse. I like Cobie Smulders, but her and Cruise weren't a great pairing; its a step down from Rosamund Pike.The film has a not very memorable, prototypical villain who strikes the same chords of generic spy films of the past. You can't get behind loathing this guy and that's a problem. If a film isn't allowing you to connect with its main characters you just go through the motions of the film without really feeling anything. That's basically how this film felt for me. Everything about this film just screams average. There are a few moments where the dialogue is just so bland, you wonder how it was written and approved into the script.It may sound like I'm complaining a lot but it really is the case that this was such a step down from the first film. The more infuriating bit is that its an Edward Zwick film and he brought us two pretty sensational films in The Last Samurai and Blood Diamond. There's real raw emotion in the latter, something that's completely lacking in the new Reacher. Its just another sequel that got churned out into the mix and I think it clouds the quality of the future films. I may 'never go back' to Jack Reacher after this effort.5.5/10"
" Laughably funny dialogue out of Sin City
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,2,"This is an unintentional comedy. Here are a couple of lines between hero and villain.Good: Let's finish this. Just you and me.Bad: I'm gonna have some fun with your pretty little girl.Good: I'm gonna break your arms. I'm gonna break your legs. I'm gonna break your neck. What you hear is excitement.Bad: Nice try. I found a way to hurt you like you never hurt before.The whole movie is like this. It's straight out of Sin City without the fun, wit and memorable characters. And the cinematography. It's Cruise being Cruise, the baddest, smartest and most kick-ass guy on the planet. He only has $40 in his pocket but somehow he's always being able to afford a half decent lifestyle. This is the stuff of dumb pulp fiction, without any of the appeal. The acting is terrible. The female lead is stiffer than a redwood. There is zero chemistry between Cruise and the female lead making the premise of this film preposterous. And the deadliest villain of all is about as menacing as he is eloquent. (See the dialogue.)There is a reason why this film flopped at the box office. Because it's horrible. Even the story of how Reacher got into ""the twist"" is too dumb to be believed. No wonder no actor of repute would take this dud. They should never have gone back to the well. It was dry in the first place."
" It could have been worse..
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,3,"Three stars or four..hmm, well I had to go with three stars. Thats actually UP from two stars because of Tom Cruise. When I say it could have been worse I mean it might have starred Owen Wilson. Or Adam Sandler. Or Mark Wahlberg. Now THAT would be worse. Tom handles his fame and power well, selecting movies to not strain his screen presence, speaking dialog to conceal his lisp and wearing lifts to hit the mark with more vertically endowed actors. The story is almost irrelevant. Except for the fact Jack Reacher is about 250 pounds and 6'5"" in the books and the producers ignore that fact and put another of the apparently limitless horde of short actors in the role. What is it with Hollywood and short guys? Is it cheaper to make smaller sets? Costs less money in wardrobe? Anyway, expect the usual out of this movie and you won't be disappointed."
" Sad Choice
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,3,"This movie was painful to watch. It shows that the director who was also the writer must have been a newbie. It also shows that the seasoned actor has not read the script prior to making his choice to sign on for the film, he must have signed because of the prior success of the previous film of Jack Reacher. You can clearly see that seasoned actor and actress were struggling with the script, dialogue and overall plot.Hopefully Tom Cruise can actually start reading his scripts before signing onto films instead of basing it on his fame, advice of others, and marketing to see the success of the films. If not he will tarnish his reputation as a good actor where the rust spots are already being seen."
" This is a Jean Claude Van Dame level movie B-
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,3,"This is worse than part 1. Part was wasn't too bad, but this is plain awful. It is wrong on many levels - the plot is incredibly weak, the acting is awful, and the script is straight out of a 70s B movie. In an alternate universe this movie star Jean Claude Van Dame. However in this universe Tom Cruise appears to have failed miserably, as did direction, script writing etc.Corny lines like, ""They ran out of Medal"" when referring to how heavily awarded this former MP is, happen to be just one example amongst the many.Then there is the plot, the pointless proactive attempt by the bad guys to lock up and kill Major Smulders, follow Jack Reacher, create a professional baddie that takes things personally. This may well be the tipping point decline in the career of Tom Cruz, he just looked past it, slow, completely unbelievable.I won't say much more, this movie isn't worth wasting the time on the critique."
" Terrible. Clichéd. Narcissistic pleasure vehicle for Cruise
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,2,"I'll get right to the point. Cruise leaves one location and then somehow the camera cuts to an empty street, leaving you the viewer to guess that Cruise arrived there from the previous scene. Nobody is in view as he turns the corner. Suddenly two guys appear from behind. And then he approaches an intersection and there are more men coming from the sides. I wonder. Will Jackie boy beat them all up as if he's Chuck Norris taking on stiff bullies? This is like a bad 70s TV show except it takes itself deadly seriously. The few jokes in the film are flatter than the EKG of those who wrote this script. The big Reacher reveal about secret that may change his life forever his hilariously bad. Things don't happen the way they did in the movie. Everyone is guilty or responsible because they have to be in order to keep the plot going. Proof? Unnecessary. Even a shred of it. People don't act on claims that aren't believable. And that's how this movie falls apart from the start, including the laughably bad promises of the villain. Zero chemistry from any of the actors. This was purely a made to pay off of Cruise's name. Terrible."
" Shouldn't have gone there in the first place
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,3,"There was no reason to ruin a good character in pulp fiction. Anyone can come up with a Tom Cruise ego trip story, where he is a super bad ass who can beat up a dozen people in a single fight with ease. Same regurgitated overconfident nonsense that sounds like something coming from your executive guru. In 15 seconds that pay phone is going to ring and I'm going to have all your butts kicked.For reasons unexplained, Cruise is after the sexy military lady he's never actually met. And since he has nothing else to do in his sorry excuse for a life which he somehow survives on with pocket change, he's decided to come back to save her from some unknown sinister plot. Throw in some ridiculous subplot that will change his life forever, although he doesn't seem to have paid much attention. Only good enough to have the subject of his attention somehow use the same tricks and same lines on him as he uses on others. Wow, is this some much too clever way of saying ""you two must be related?"" Or is it a red herring? This film is too clichéd and full of stupid lines that try so hard to be clever.I had a difficult time making it through the first third of the film since, as usual, it's just way too easy for a bad ass like this Reacher guy who ""they ran out of medals"" to award him for his awesomeness. It's a Cruise ego trip with a paint by number story where the good guys make all the things that would seem so very hard seem so simple and where security you'd expect to encounter just happens to be conveniently missing. They should never have tried to do these novels in the first place. A straight to cable quality B movie. Don't spend money on this one."
