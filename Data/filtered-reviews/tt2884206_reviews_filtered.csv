" WATCH THE CLIP AFTER THE CREDITS!!!
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,9,Very original. Great acting. Fascinating concepts and innuendos. This is one of those thought provoking movies.
" Great Movie
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,9,For all the posters that thought this was slow and boring.... Go watch Rambo ! Thought provoking and heart warming story. Loved it !
" Heartbreaking but Original film
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,8,"Love lives beyond death is a good message and in this film we watch as a man goes from the tragic death of his love, to finding a new purpose in life and searching for her to the ends of the earth.Michael Pitt did an amazing job in this film and although the film gets fairly dark at parts, it never got boring and following his journey to find his love was amazing!"
" Need to Rewatch
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,9,Saw this years ago when it first came out and recently saw it suggested again. It reminded me of the film and how much I liked it at the time. Especially the tragic elevator scene. Michael Pitt really did a great job in it.
" Stunningly beautiful story
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,"The love, the spirituality, the philosophy... I don't know what to say. My only complaint is that I wouldn't call it sci-fi at all. But whatever it is, it moved me."
" HALF ROMANTIC HALF EXISTENTIAL
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,7,"It's a deep movie with some artistic and religious references all around the film. Even the main characters are like the opposites: The science man vs. the spiritual woman.Besides, there are a lot of symbolical meanings of the objects to explain the ""holy"" meaning of things. For instance, opening the door at the end of the film represents opening yourself to the other side of the world just like Sofi said in the bedroom scene.And also the obvious elevator scene which represents the main connection between the indian girl and Sofi can be explained in this way too.These scenes are very impressive of course, however in general, the whole plot changes when Sofi dies in the middle of the movie. That's why the first part of the film feels like a romantic movie but the second part is a scientific adventure movie which is absolutely weird.I wish that the storytelling of the movie was based on a more strict and direct narrative. Because of this, i lost the interest in the whole structure of the movie.It could have been a cult film, i'm deeply sorry for that it obviously not."
" Iris this could have been different..
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,6,"This movie has some interesting guts, but it is missing the bones needed for the plot and character development to really carry out the message of the film. The ideas are not new, and some of them are illogical, but I love the notion of science being put into question; not in favour of a higher power, but merely for improving upon itself. Still as Carl Sagan put it:
""Humans may crave absolute certainty; they may aspire to it; they may pretend ... to have attained it. But the history of science-by far the most successful claim to knowledge accessible to humans-teaches that the most we can hope for is successive improvement in our understanding, learning from our mistakes, an asymptotic approach to the Universe, but with the proviso that absolute certainty will always elude us.""
Therefore, it's kind of maddening that the only reliable response to uncertainty is to keep seeking more uncertainty, and to not even for a second entertain the idea that faith is merely the belief in that which is uncertain.
I liked that Sofi questions Ian's innate fear in moving beyond his own belief system. Her character while a little shallow, does pose him some probing questions. Why is he so intent on disproving that there might be a God? Why are atheists or people grounded in science so intent on creating a world in which everything is certain and within the limits of whatever parameters we set up? Isn't there beauty in the whole, without the reduction of everything into its parts. Is a snowflake as mesmerizing if we reduce to to mere frozen falling ice?
We've all become so riddled by what we don't know, placed in to two groups: People who consider something greater at play, or people who spend their lives trying to reduce it all into neat and tidy scientific explanations. Could it be that we aren't so divided after all, that the centre of the Venn is simply a lack of knowing and the unsettling nature it instills in all of us.The movie explores beautiful ideas and ideals. Reincarnation and soul mates, love and grief. I say beautiful, because although other reviewers had problems with Ian abandoning his scientific ideals for numerology at the very sight of an attractive female, I found that this further cemented the cognitive dissonance that comes with strong beliefs on either side. He is suddenly moved by the all encompassing force that is love, yet still surprised by his curiosity in someone who sees the world completely differently and with such wonder.I really disliked the vapid character development and the unrealistic plot developments. I feel that marrying Karen was a way to bury his grief, and I feel that his relationship with Sofi was never fully developed. Instead they could have developed both relationships alongside one another to showcase the dichotomy between science and spirit. There were some heart wrenching moments and I was moved by some of the possible answers to the questions posed.I do enjoy the idea interconnectedness and this theme did get woven into the framework of the film overall, like when Ian says to Sofi ""When the big bang happened, all the atoms in the universe, they were all smashed together into one little dot that exploded outward. ... So my atoms have known your atoms and they've always known your atoms. My atoms have always loved your atoms.""He may not have seen her a life partner, but it did not change the fact that he did indeed love her, and that she forever left her mark on him.There aren't many films that really explore the spirit and soul in love, and what is love, if not some pheromones mixed with a little crazy blind faith?"
" It may have flaws but it's still interesting.
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,7,"This is definitely not for everyone. First, it's one of those slow paced sci-fi movies that is trying to make you think rather than throw visual eye candy at you (which I'm also a fan of, no dissing any sci-fi style here). It also takes quite a few liberties with actual science, but I'm ok with it as long as it serves the narrative and I do think it works in this case. Overall pretty interesting and original so I'd recommend it so you can make your own opinion."
" Offensive to my intelligence
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,2,"I'll try to be brief here. This hipster movie was so offensive and distasteful that I had to create an account and rate it.
1. How very gross and stupid is to make that death scene. It is painted in my memory and I cannot possibly find any meaning in it. Except for cheap trills.
2. Brit Marling's character finds her husband sniffing some french perfume secretly while touching himself thinking of his dead gf, and she's OK with it.
3. The movie starts with 1st person narration and then it forgets about it.
4. The notion of spirituality is just words and nothing else. What do the characters mean by spirit world? Those studios and crews seem to lack basic minimal knowledge of those concepts.not a single spiritual writer or idea was mentioned.
5. The baby scene was creepy. What happened with that research? What's with the dead guy's family? Ian finds them then nothing. Why did they put those scenes at all?
6. Creepy creepy main character takes the girl to his room and nothing seems to be wrong with that.
7. And finally , my main problem with that nonsense movie is the French girl, who is the ultimate stock character. She is lacking any features and depth. She is some sort of wild manic pixie dream girl that speaks random new age crap. And the guy is falling for that? No, no, let's be honest here she's just sexually open dressed with miniskirts and knee high sock. She's french ,no parents, no education, no boundaries. She's having her time. Until she doesn't. Well, I find this offensive to women and women who are open to spirituality.Hope you find my review interesting."
" Startling movie
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,9,"Beatifically crafted movie! I love the way movie immerses various characters and ensnares audience in intriguing way. Starts with utter scientific inclination and ends with spiritual tinge. Gave 9/10 instead of 10/10 because being an Indian it irks me that India is always portrait as a poor country. They could have very well shown middle or upper middle class locality of India. India is not ""just"" what western movies show. Anyways, story line was amazing."
" Overcoming Blindness...
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,8,"I ORIGINS is another fascinating, mystical / science fiction tale starring Brit Marling. Research scientist, Ian (Michael Pitt) is studying / working on the evolution of sight, in order to prove how eyes developed. Together with his brilliant research assistant, Karen (Marling), Ian is on the verge of a major breakthrough when he meets a mysterious woman named Sofi (Astrid Berges-Frisbey). This leads to love and tragic loss. Seven years later, Ian and Karen are drawn into a series of inexplicable events that cause them to rethink their purely logical outlook. An intriguing film full of drama, humor, and unexpected occurrences..."
" Simply Awesome!!!!
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,9,"Another Perfect Sci-Fi movie from 20th century studios. Just skip all positive and negative reviews. Download and watch the movie. Ending was heartbreak scene and remarkable one. Perfect!!!Just skip Rotten tomatoes critics review. We all know that 30 bunch of looser who are thinking them self a Critic reviewers writing review only based on Money ,Cast and their own profit. So trust the audience score rather than these looser scores."
" Great concept
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,8,"Just finished the movie. Loved the concept!It would be fantastic to see It if science is able to prove this one day. It's a cliche to say this but science and religion are trying to understand the same thing. And the easter egg at the end gave me goosebumps.Have to say though the test wasn't perfectly designed as the test result could potentially be tainted by cash incentives.He shouldn't say ""right""/""wrong"" for the girl's answers as we can see she got a bit worried getting the wrong answers half way through the test (or it could be the camera work, what am I talking about .. this is not a documentary, but still).He shouldn't have taken the girl to an expensive hotel room and fed the girl her favorite food before the test because if the girl has been living in a poor condition she would probably do anything to please just so she could get this luxury treatment again.Same thing could be said for the defining moment - the elevator and crying scene, which could be still understood as the fact that she doesn't want to go back to that poor life again.But anyways, as a movie it is powerful enough to spark the curiosity, drag me along and Make me write this review after watching. Loved it!"
" A masterpiece!
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,10,One of my favourite movies. Amazing actors and script. Exceptional. The soundtrack is amazing too.
" Good SciFi/Fantasy
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,7,"I wouldn't have known that this was an indie as it's competently made with a strong story. It does, however, leave some loose ends due to issues not addressed earlier in the plot. I would have chosen a less corny title!"
" Great Expectations, Cliche' Ending!
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,6,"This movie is well acted and the atmosphere builds up momentum. A movie about reincarnation for skeptics which turns really predictable in the end. The beginning was really exiting because Sophie's sentences felt really true and profound as she was about to disclose something truly amazing about herself but, she suddenly dies and gets instantly reincarnated in a little Indian girl who is scared of lifts. I was really expecting something really sci-fiish, an eye opener for something I had yet not considered in this life but instead it was the old boring reincarnation cliche'. What a pity!"
" Creative I Forms.
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,8,My Rating : 8/10Intentionally poignant filmmaking which aims to give the viewer a more spiritual awakening as opposed to a scientific one.Universal issues addressed in a sensitive and beautiful way few films manage - let alone commercial movie business which aims to spoon-feed viewers agenda.Highest recommendation.
" Boring and boring
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,2,"It's not even a spiritual movie nor a sci fi movie. Total plot was stupid. Totally a waste of time and I swear to god, I never watch an Australian director movie again."
" Unique psychological drama.
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,10,"One of those movies which every person will experience differently. I can see how some will find this film to be nonsense or boredom. To me, it's a very interesting film. The whole idea it tries to portray is very well executed. But I must admit that this film only goes for the idea, it does not have any kind of side stories or stuff, like it's storytelling does not feel like from average movie. You have to watch it yourself to understand what I mean. I do definitely recommend it if you're looking for some serious film.By the way, there is an awesome after credit scene, be sure not to miss that."
" A very unique movie
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,"I origins is a sci-fi drama film written and directed by Mike Cahill. I can't say the movie is pure sci-fi, it's partly spiritual. The main lead is Ian Gray played beautifully and flawlessly by Micheal Pitt. Ian Gray is studying the evolution of human eyes with his Lab Partner( played beautifully by Brit Marling). He fell in love with Sofi who has a very beautiful pair of eyes. But as the movie progresses we can find that there are dissimilarities between Sofi and Ian. Sofi believes in God but Ian doesn't.The real interest begins after 1 hour. Every person has a unique iris pattern but as you watch the movie you will get to know that the fact is wrong.My favorite part is when Ian and Priya have a conversation about Dala lama's answer to the question ""What would you do if something scientific disproved your religious beliefs?"". And he said, after much thought, ""I would look at all the papers. I'd take a look at all the research and really try to understand things. And in the end, if it was clear that the scientific evidence disproved my spiritual beliefs, I would change my beliefs."" . What a mindblowing answer.I am not telling much more about the movie because I don't want to ruin it for anyone. I am recommending everyone to watch I Origins. I liked the way the movie connects spirituality to scientific facts.I was really impressed by watching this movie. It has a fresh and different concept. A must watch !!!!"
" Just Beautiful
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,8,"This movie is a work of art. Purely beautiful. This is coming from a 27 year old guy who just can't cry to movies. The only other movie that got me was The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Both gave me a tear. Not a tear of sadness, but one from a feeling I can't quite explain. I'm not intelligent enough to find the perfect word. It made me feel good in a time where I was losing faith in beautiful things. Depression is a dark cloud that blocks the mind's eye. This movie gave me a sense of clearing clouds. Please just give it a watch. All the way through."
" What you watch by accident and end up loving
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,8,"Low budget scifi handled very much in the style of 'primer'.No, they didn't get EVERYTHING right but most of the science is plausible. The acting from both leads is out of this world and well beyond the evidently very low production budget of this movie.If you enjoyed 'eternal sunshine' or 'serependity' you'll love this."
" Wonderful /Unique
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,10,"I am like movie fanatci and seeing movie since 2008 but never write any reviews.
This movie is so powerful that force me to write some line to make recognition of this movie.
I have are here to decide to watch it then dont waste time. the movie is about atheist person who is looking for scientific reason for .....Just watch it"
" This was unfortunately selected for a company movie night
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,2,"And this is the way the rating machine works. A large number of bots rate this movie 10 or 9, people believe it is a good movie and with time the people rate it they way the movie really is.Still it stays overrated. Just read what others write in here. Ones and twos are a good reference."
" What we can't see
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,8,"I think that the guideline of the film tells us that behind the apparent certainty of things, facts, feelings, there are invisible signs that we are unable to see and interpret; but these exist and we must try to think that behind the easy appearance there is a world to discover and probably possible.
Matteo Venturini (Milano - Italy)"
" Wonderful story that stays with you.
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,10,"Romance, mystery and a bit of sci-fi created into a beautiful story.
I was well drawn into this film, it captures you from the very beginning. There wasn't a moment where I got bored, I couldn't wait to find out what happens next. Well done 👏"
" Wonderful
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,9,"Worth every minute of your time. Yes, it's mushy, no, the science probably doesn't add up (not that I'd know or care), yes it's slow-moving, but do you know what? This is a beautiful film."
" Its Just a Movie!
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,7,"I was expecting bad comments about this movie but I had never thougth I was floating around in scientific magazines. There are too few critics about script, cinematography or acting about I Origins. I think IMDb users had an extra mission that proving the reincarnation is fake. Maybe or maybe not. But, come on guys! Let the scientists decide! I totally dissapointed seeing people who insults others like ""you're moron, no honor etc.""I think the director wanted to tell a story. In my opinion comments must say the way of work is good or bad. Not the story is true or wrong!"
" Sci Fi???
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,1,"This ridiculous movie is nothing more than a chick flick masquerading as ""Sci Fi"". It's about as ""Sci Fi"" as my last bowel movement, and as ""deep"" as one of Peppa Pig's muddy puddles! And not even as scientifically literate as Peppa Pig! If you're into New Age rubbish and the kind of low IQ trash peddled by the likes of Deepack Chopra then you'll love this nonsense.
If, on the other hand, you're a science fiction fan, scientifically literate to at least UK secondary school level, then this is not for you.
It's like like watching the inside of a 12 year old's brain as they encounter philosophy for the first time!"
" Flat earthers only
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,1,"Dreadful waste of time, ludicrous plot, one only for those willing to believe the daftest"
" Utter disappointment and lack of any logic (even for a sci-fi)
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,1,I don't understand why people even try making movies when they completely lack any idea what the movie is going to be about. This total mess of a movie is a complete waste of time. Feels like the screenplay was written on the go and they first wrote 20% of the movie then made it => then changed their mind wrote another 30% with a completely different idea and so on. The result is me standing here watching while having convulsions of how bad this film is. Really sloppy and random. I don't think the screenwriter has any idea of how human interactions work and how people communicate overall.2 Words to describe the movie - sad cringe.
" Learn something made up every day
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,4,"All I will say about the movie is....No problem a middle age white man can pick up a 7 year old girl in the slums of India and bring her back to his hotel room.Otherwise, I managed to stay away through the movie as I watched it on a trans Atlantic flight."
" This is an awesome ride!
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,6,"Good story that is fun to follow - 1 StarMemorable dialogue - 1/2 StarFeel a pull to watch it a second time - 1/2 StarMusic/Score stands out - 0 StarNo noticeable plot holes - 1/2 StarStory gets resolved in some way - 1 StarI personally like the story - 1 StarMemorable likable characters - 1 StarMost things about the story are believable - 0 StarsDoesn't get boring - 1/2 StarThe concept of this movie is truly inspiring and thought provoking.
I wish there were more films like this that test the waters and aren't afraid of religious boundary's.
The acting was great and the story is one of a kind."
" One of the best drama sci-fi movies
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,9,"Tear drops coming in the end. Astrid Berges Frisbey has really remarkable beauty. Michael Pitt is Michael Pitt. Always qualifying his roles. Story, the concept is brilliant."
" Conceptually an interesting movie, but practically boring and inconsistent
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,4,"A colleague of mine suggested me this movie. He told me that it was one of the best film that he ever watch, so I was very curious about it. I did not watch the trailer and I avoided every wikipedia and IMDb pages, I just had a generic plot told by my friend, but that's it.The movie put in conflict religion and science, the world of the myth, against the world of facts and pure rationality. It does that in a different and original way, and should have been the main core of the movie, but instead it takes only a small portion, and is a topic that is not deepen enough in my opinion. The director left too much space on screen on a useless love story that is completely incoherent and that ends in a really tragic way for no reason at all. The latest 40 minutes of the movie are the most interesting and most coherent with the plot. From ""I Origins"", I was expecting something that tells me a story about the origin of mankind, or that explains how we are all linked. The truth is that the plot is misleading, as well as the title. Casting choices are good, but this is the only good point.Maybe I am not able to appreciate this kind of movie, it depends on my personal taste. I found it boring, and I was wondering when was going to finish. I almost gave up. The ending is really disappointing."
" A decent film and it made me cry
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,8,"Beautiful direction as expected from the director and this film touches heart more in last half hour.
Feeling so much empathy to underprivileged people after watching it that I would try to do my part as best as I can.
Thank you for this decent film"
" Humans connecting at a spiritual, emotional level
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,8,"This was emotionally captivating and felt very real. Movies like these restore faith in humanity. All I see is love in this movie, love is the only beautiful emotion that is positive about this world. We can change the world through love and acceptance. Karma is another aspect that I found interesting however its scientifically not possible to determine any person's karmic afterlife in a bodily human form."
" I can't work out...
",2019-10-09 00:00:00,6,"If it is dire because the ""scientist"" has zero idea of how to not lead the results of a social experiment.Or if it is genius because it let's you have what you want. If you want to believe #spoiler .... that the girl remembers the lift from a previous life you can. If you want to look at the way the interview is filmed and consider the girl thinks she ""makes a bad test"" and was breaking down because she is back to the street after failing to please the rich foreigner , you can see ,the cues for that too."
" Great concept
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,9,"Great concept, brilliantly executed. A gem.I waited for this to soar on Netflix for literally years."
" Loved it!
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,10,"Had no idea about where the movie was taking me, which was refreshing. It touched upon an inner voice that is deep within us all."
" VISIONER
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,9,Best cinematography that i ever see and the story was incredible!
" Not as much sci-fi as a beautiful story.
",2019-08-23 00:00:00,8,"With a seemingly believe able premise, I Origins succeeds remarkably in its storytelling. Simple characters are so brilliantly played by a remarkable cast that they always stay with you even as the movie moves through time. The science though, thought provoking is minimal and as real as it could get. Beautifully shot scenes combined with exceptional subtlety compliment the effortless flow of this movie. I feel it is a incredibly touching piece of wholesome cinema that somehow still leaves you asking for more."
" A Meaningful Ending
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,8,"As this is a spoiler based review, I want to directly go to this one point I'd like to talk about which made me feel something. At the ending where Ian and the little girl are waiting for the elevator, as soon as the elevator opens the little girl starts crying. But this time, Ian's there for her and he hugs her very tightly, this time he saves her. He gets to say his goodbye, and so the movie ends in a meaningful way."
" One of the best movies I've ever seen
",2019-06-22 00:00:00,10,And l'll tell you why. First of all the storyline is amazing. Mike chill (director) comes up with an amazing idea that most of us didn't notice at all. The story of the eye. How come the iris looks like the whole universe is inside it? Is entiligent creator involved? Look in the mirror and think about it. With that he brings an amazing love story and unexpected relationship between a scientist and spiritual lady. The symbols and dialogues in the movie are breathtaking. He made feel so emotional but yet so doubter about so many things. Amazing footage and soundtracks. I'm speechless.
" IT IS DANGEROUS TO PLAY GOD
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,8,"Ian Gray (Michael Pitt) is an atheist fascinated with the human eye. He takes pictures of them all the time. One of his pet projects is to come up with a complete evolution of the human, as a way to foil creationists. His girlfriend however, believes in the transmigration of the soul. Circumstances become odd as Ian is faced with the possibility of using his iris scans to prove it.I liked the film. Acting was decent. It was good science fiction in the fact that it didn't going into areas of gross impossibility. The ending of the film, right before the climax, you know it is coming. as you feel the anticipation. Great scene.Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey)"
" Almost as astonishingly stupid as THE HAPPENING
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,2,"Wow, I really had no idea that I would dislike this film as much as I did. This is one of those rare cases where a movie tries to convey a meaningful and though-provoking narrative, but ends up being mind-bogglingly stupid. In that regard I ORIGINS strongly reminded me of Shyamalan's THE HAPPENING.The characters here are written incredibly stereotypical and shallow. Aside from being generally miscast, the protagonist is as cliched as an atheist scientist can be, always relying on facts and wanting to prove religion wrong in an aggressively intrusive way. What follows, is a superficial relationship with a spiritual-minded foreign girl, who also happens to have a French accent (because why not). The 26-year-old student and his hipster girlfriend then get married after knowing each other for what seems like five days, and events unfold in the most unoriginal way possible.While the cinematography here at times looks quite unprofessional, the writing is the real star of the movie. The relationship portrayed in the first half of the film seems like the wet dream of a semi-depressive 16-year-old with no life experience whatsoever. Similar to that, the movie-""science"" is really just the peg for the story about identical irises and even laughable at times - when the scientist's first-semester lab partner makes a scientific breakthrough within the first few days of work for example. To top things off, some side character is a dairy farmer, whose surname is actually Dairy ... I'll stop now.Unfortunately and unlike THE HAPPENING, this film wasn't so bad it's good, even if it occasionally had some unintentional humour going for it. The stupidity of I ORIGINS was rather agonizing and made it a particular boring watch."
" Great subject
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,9,"Evreything great
But i think mike should have to add something more
Like past memories,and much more i cant describe here
Cuz im from india and we see this thing
Past life and kind of stuff and 80% people still believe"
" 11.
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,10,"For me, I need a perfect time and place for watching this movie. Just watched it for the second time, because I somehow felt, that I need it. And it just gets better. Couldn't thought, that there will be a movie, which will mean so much to me.
It's kind of hard to describe it, because you just have to feel it by yourself.
It's a very sensitive, emotional, deep and the original one.
If you believe in coincidences and sometimes you are confused/surprised by the things, which happens to you every day and those coincidences started to have a meaning for you, you should believe in your intuition. Because it really has a meaning and something, which can't be explained. I think, that there are some things, which you can't really explain with science. Maybe it's a sign of the dreamer, but still. We are all some kind of dreamers in our minds. And it depends on us, if we want to believe on it or we will just try to explain it with science.
I guess, that many of people has something strange in their life, when they were just confused by their own mind. Have you ever met a person for the first time and felt somehow strange, that you know this person for a very long time? Or maybe you have 'your' number, which leads you every day no matter what? What about other coincidences, when you are just standing and trying to understand what just happened? Everything has a meaning. And I think, that things are somehow connected to each other, you just have to find out by yourself.
It's absolutely amazing movie with actors, who can express a sensitive emotion and a perfect soundtrack for this movie. Will watch it again for sure."
" Better don't waste your time
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,3,I saw the rating near 7.4 and that mislead me. This movie can be interesting for somebody who has never been in the lab or never read any scientific book. Completely empty movie with no idea. I still was hoping that maybe an interesting final will rescue my eve. But no))) disappointed and I don't recommend to watch this masterpiece.
" My favorite so far
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,10,"I gave it a 10 things can always be better but honestly my favorite movie so far..
I dont want to get in details so if someone is reading this they can make their own mind on it but Ill say that the movie is full of subliminal messages, esoteric teaching sings and eye opening moments.
If you are a fan or a follower of esoterics make sure you watch it atleast once.
Id suggest to do a research on things you notice and see while watching it but dont understand.. trust me its worth it!
Great movie dont miss out! Stay woke! Peace!"
" I Origins - A Rare Perfect Film
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,10,"This is a must-see film. I am not given to 10 rated movies, but this is one of them.
Mike Cahill is brilliant, both as a writer and as a director. His writing skills are off the chart. There is nothing like a great story to make a great movie, and this is why I Origins is a great film. It is a film about discovery, the possibility of alternative philosophies and science. It is a film about human relationships and how we perceive them. Any one great film about any one of these topics would be enough to gain rave reviews, but to have all four elements of these diverse topics in the same film and have the movie flow in a seamless fashion, defies most of the expectations of any moviegoer. Micheal Pitt is perfect (except for smoking lol) as the obsessive eye doctor, Brit Marling is wonderfully understated as his soulmate (be careful here with that word), Astrid Berges Frisby is very sexy, and Kashish as Salomina, the Indian orphan girl is amazing in her debut. This is as close to a perfect film as I have seen, and I have seen over 10,000 films. There will be two takes on this film from viewers philosophically. There will be those who believe strictly in science, are atheistic, and need proof for any suggestion made by researchers. Then there will be the spiritualists who believe in the possibilities of things other than science and mathematics. I am in the former group, but as an agnostic, I always leave the door a bit ajar for things that cannot be explained easily by science and mathematics. It is films like these that very rarely shake my tree to reconsider other factors. A film not to be missed."
" Enjoy spirituality? Enlightenment? Watch this film!
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,8,"Interesting perspective placed upon a unique and thought provoking ending.I'm very much into movies that open my mind as vastly and ""realistically"" as possible.If you enjoy deeper knowledge of Truth, have an open mind and seek to find answers to our existence, this movie provides. It could very well happen or has it been all along? Scientific data and ""proof"" meets spiritual inclined: something greater than us is working behind the scenes...Watch until after the credits for a brief delve of more insight.Some points of acting felt a little ""fluffy"", however, the overall plot kept me actively watching the entire film till end. I thought about the movie the whole next day....Additionally, Brit in the OA is one of my top 5 all time favorite shows. If you like that show, give this movie a go."
" Wow ! One of the best ...
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,10,I would never write a review but ... this is really a well made movie . Before you watch make sure you have 2 hours free . Just enjoy the movie !!!
" Rebirth destroy Christianity
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,10,Shouldn't this movie be tagged as anti-christian. because the core-belief of Christianity reject rebirth or re-incarnation.
" Fine... I guess...
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,5,"This is one of those movies that has a complicated plo so I don't like it. I mean, not necessarily, because I am a fan of Cloud Atlas per say, but there was something unnatural about I Origins and especially its meaning. I did realize yes that it was a battle against science and spirituality, but I think this was not explored well enough in the movie. I think too many things just started and were so brief. I loved the passion the protagonist had about making an artificial eye for example, but halfway through the movie we basically lose this. The worm gets an eye, he is on the television... cool! But what then? Then he is searching for this woman lowkey believing her soul may be in the child. And I'm all sitting there going like bullcrap! I mean come on, it's obvious that yeah he was gonna find the child and be all spiritual and stuff, but please... like too obvious. But I did like how he found out because she was afraid of elevators.I really did not believe the character of Sophie. She doesn't seem real, I think her character should had been developed way more than it was. However I did believe the scientist's character. I think there was some great acting and screenwriting put into him."
" Unique. Definitely Worth the Watch
",2018-06-22 00:00:00,7,"I watched this movie with my father who happens to be an ophthalmologist. He discovered a few bugs here and there, but he also found nice references. Anyways, this is my opinion. I really loved the aesthetic filming and the suitable setting. The ways the mood of the movie changed after ""plot points"" were interesting to watch. The love scenes were also dazzling and delicate. Each of them was unique, and real at the same time. The contrast between Ian and Sofi's ""beliefs"" was very intriguing. There were some nice punchlines and metaphors, but at the same time, some of them were rather vague and/or cliché. (I'm not gonna complain because this whole issue is pretty vague!) Overall, I dig the dialogues! You could easily identify the character archetypes. But at the same time, the way each incident, discovery, and phenomenon helped each person's development was tangible and amusing. Sofi's death for example. And the way it impacted Ian's life. It was a huge turning point. The ""lab day"" was the day that Ian ""won"" and ""lost"". In my opinion, the finest aspect about this movie was the state of turmoil and bewilderment. It was thoroughly implemented in the film. So many people disliked the movie because of the controversial closure. I believe that you shouldn't watch this movie looking for an ""epic plot twist"" or for your ""beliefs"" to be approved. The point about this movie is not the ending or the ""conclusion"". There will never be an answer. That's why I was low-key disappointed with how spirituality hit the final strike. But honestly, I couldn't really think of a better ending, since ""religion and spirituality"" wasn't even utterly approved. I believe that this film was about the thought-process of the characters and their pragmatic and tangible feelings, thoughts, and reactions. Note that evolution was approved and so was spirituality.My favorite scenes were Sofi's passing AND the final elevator scene! Salomina was afraid of elevators. MANNote: There's a scene after the credits! WATCH IT! I LOVED IT!"
" The idea is brilliant but...
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,5,I read many good reviews about the film and I was excited to watch it. The idea is really brilliant but the way the story handled this idea was less than expected. There is this strange sensation and unpleasant feeling when the movie reached to the end.
" The best
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,10,"I don't like ""arty farty"" films at all.I agree there are some bizarre scenes but the unique plot makes this film one of my favourites.Do not give this film a miss due to some bad reviews. I think it is brilliant!"
" Worth Paying Attention To
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,7,"My score: 7/10. Interstellar brought in a new sub-genre of sci-fi we can call ""oddity."" ""I Origins"" fits into that category I think because there is a whole lot of oddity going on here. Most of it is interesting and intriguing but there are times I have to admit the details were lost on me.The director gave us ""Another Earth"" which is also a sort of dreamy sci-fi netherworld. I don't think all things in his films are meant to be understood but rather felt. Retina photos are like fingerprints which allow a scientist to identify people anywhere in the world. That, in fact, is where this film takes him as he studies and makes conclusions based on people's eyes.I thought things were jumping around in time but discovered there is only some of that going on. This film will require your full concentration to get what is happening. At the same time, if you open yourself up to the film, I think you will be pleased with it and its final result. Because it will not appeal to traditional audiences who prefer more simple answers, it loses a couple of points. Still, I did enjoy it but understand it does require your full attention until the end. 7/10."
" In one word: Beautiful
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,8,"I will be the first person to admit I am not a huge fan of Art House movies. This movie is definitely shot like one, with cameras going in and out of focus occasionally and some obscure character interactions that tend not to happen in real life. But then again, I have lived a strange life and the kinds of interactions that I have had are similar to this. I Origins teases that line of Art House and Hollywood by being pulled back by the scientific precision that our protagonist exemplifies in the movie. He is a bit of an eccentric man driven by cold, hard facts and it is the way he approaches life in this way, especially with relationships, that creates drama and emotion. When the line between science and the spiritual becomes blurred with him is where I believe a lot of people have been.I Origins does not create any conclusion between these two dilemma-induced ways of thinking, rather letting the audience draw their own. All I can say is by the end of the movie I was in tears. It is simply beautiful.This movie is not for everyone; but for those it does touch, it will touch you in a big way. There is always room in our lives for something not created by the Hollywood machine that inspires questions about reality and the possibilities that we haven't explored."
" In its simplicity, it's a time-pause stellar !
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,8,"This is one of those few movies which go on slow, but they are really advancing on the other hand, it'ts a cinematographic paradox. The subject was really interesting, it's physics vs meta-physics. Any bad writing could've made of this a total train-wreck, but no, the director is a genius, and made a masterpiece out of this concept. Props, really, one of the best B-grade films. 8/10!"
" Worthless Rating (7.4) by IMDb reviewers ever!!!
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,10,"Sorry to say but this is the lowest rating on a brilliant movie ever. What is wrong with the reviewers, I don't know but You leave with tears and some rare thoughts( ofcourse scientific) after watching the movie. Give it a shot..You will never be disappointed if you are a SCIENCE fan!!!"
" A beautiful work of ART which could have used a lot more colors.
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,6,"I ORIGINS- 65%
This story is absolutely breathtaking, however, I feel like the story, the structure, and the actors could have done so much more. 
Story wise and execution: 30/35
Acting: 14.2/25
Camera work: 11.2/20
Sound: 10/20"
" Motion Picture Script
",2018-01-24 00:00:00,5,"Mike Cahill obviously knows the ""backwards"" trick. I don´t blame him, the ending is very emotional and well managed. Kind of spectacular, even. He must have listened to Radiohead´s ""Motion Picture Soundtrack"" and thought ""I gotta put this on my next film"". The problem is, because of that trick being unpolished, everything until that point is terribly mechanical (best summary I can think of without spoilers). Some parts are sloppy, some are rushed and some others are both. It does get better as it goes, though, the low point being definitely the beginning (now, why would that be?). There´s enough going on to be entertained and the concept should provide some discussion but, frankly, it´s not a very good movie. I totally recommend it."
" Amazing!
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,10,"Can't tell you how amazing the whole movie is. Amazing story, people, amazing directing, good music choices, even the lights in the film... The feelings after I saw are beyond expression! Not for everyone though. :)"
" A waste of two good actors
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,2,"Despite a number of positive reviews for this film collected here, I'm afraid I have to be the dissenting voice. I found I ORIGINS a very difficult film to watch, purely because it's boring in scope and tone. The story explores some sci-fi concepts regarding the human eye and reincarnation, but they're dealt with in the dreariest way imaginable, with endless soul-searching and lame romantic sub-plots that drag out an already slow pacing. What's particularly disappointing is the waste of two fine TV actors, Michael Pitt (of BOARDWALK EMPIRE) and Steven Yeun (of THE WALKING DEAD). I feel like the ideas might have worked better as a term paper instead of a pretend film."
" Anti-science
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,2,"Film lures you in early with some scientific sleight-of-hand and then reveals the true agenda of writer/director-A weak attempt to bash science in its entirety without any real critique on the complexities of the subject. Another insecure spiritualist who feels like science doesn't acknowledge their feelings enough. In the context of the recent upsurge in climate-change denyers and anti-vaxxers, I actually found this film offensive."
" Quite Interesting.
",2017-12-15 00:00:00,7,The elevator scene was a masterpiece. However I feel like it starts with greater force than it ends with.
" Pretensions American cinema at its best
",2017-11-30 00:00:00,4,"This movie is so boring and pretentious. The worst is Pitt's interpretation, so arrogant and obnoxious. He should remember himself that he started in Dawson's Creek, perhaps his interpretations would be more humble. And this goddamn cliché that the men are the rational ones, women are just crazy little creatures, oh man, this is so bad."
" Pseudo-scientific but nice
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,6,"This movie has been on my watch list for a while. I finally made the decision to watch it because of its enticing synopsis. However, now that I've actually seen it I feel tricked. The synopsis is more of a ruse; the actual movie has very little to do with what's described in it. You'll see. With that being said I do have a gripe with the ""science"" in the movie. As someone with a background in science I know that most of the things that are being presented as ""facts"" in this movie are nothing but humbug. You can't create iris scans from ""high res"" images. And that's not the only pseudo-science that's prevalent in ""I Origins"". But I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just end it here.The movie was OK but I can't help but feel a little disappointed. I was expecting something very different; a movie about the origin of self / consciousness. But instead we've watched a movie about eyes. Very funny play of words (/sarcasm). Just because ""I"" is a homonym for eye that doesn't justify this type of trickery. I feel betrayed."
" no question for me that this was as great a sci/fi as I have seen
",2017-10-19 00:00:00,10,"admittedly not my favorite movie genre, I have long been a fan & sci/fi is high on my second tier much of my affection comes from the setting, having worked for two years at MSKCC just opposite Rockefeller University where much of this was set all the leads were commendable, the story plausible, direction tight & with at least one well done gory scene (not gratuitous,) all the more effective for its surprise the diverse venues (NYC, East Coast & Near Eastern Asia) are lovingly filmed with strong production values I love the New Age sensibility, though I can understand why some may not this science is REAL folks, though some may question some of it speculation is what science is all about, don't you know? I Origins is a romantic, feel good sci/fi flick, though not long on thrills, replete with wonderful venues well worth a viewing, cuddling with someone you love¿what more can you want on a Saturday night?"
" A Meeting with Reality
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,9,This movie is iconic. I like it because it shows something I really confused about. It mingles the spirituality with science. The eye in its complexity is known to be the window to our souls. The movie is beautifully directed and actors are so perfect. I believe you are gonna surely like this movie if you like this genre.
" Targeting your beliefs
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,2,"I like the battle between religion and science, but in an unbiased way. This movie tries ""to bias"" (as the child's name) your beliefs. If you want something to be believed by people, use facts. I'm not sure what was the purpose of writer, but here, we are watching a possible and not-yet-proved way that spirits exist. That's not good.It doesn't explain how a spirit can change before resurrection. As we see, Salomina's personality is different from Sofi's. How's that? If they share the same spirit in their bodies, how come that Salomina failed the test? On the other hand, the spirit should at least remember Ian's face.Just referencing to a kid that scares from an elevator isn't scientific.They concluded that two eyes can be exactly the same, so can the brains. I couldn't find a relation between these results and existence of the spirit. How does spirit shape the eyes or brains? Is there a one-to-one relationship between eyes/brains shape and spirits? I can accept that two brains may process in the same way. They perhaps need the exact same structure. It even makes more sense when we see that Tobias passes its three tests but Salommina which is older that Tobias (and perhaps some years of living, geographical difference and her lifestyle has changed it's personality and the way he thinks or perefer things) fails.So many questions are not answered. For more, see other reviews."
" Can't Disprove It
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,8,"Well first off, the acting is superb. Michael Pitt is one of the most underrated actors out there, he's terrific as always. Astrid Berges- Frisbey is amazing as the free spirited girl that we all want to attain. Her character reminds one of Kate Winslet's character in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Brit Marling is good as the 'safe' choice. However, Marling is a great actress, and has been better. The chemistry between Pitt and Frisbey though is amazing. The passion is right there as we have all felt that kind of passion in a relationship or two, or within a deep dream we've had. Cahill writes such a magnificent script, a great writer he is. He puts such amazing and thought provoking analogies(touching on butterfly effect, reincarnation, miracles, destiny, God, etc.) in this film without compromising the film itself i.e. the film is never contrived in any of the analogies that are used where in a lesser film trying to use analogies like Cahill did would come off contrived. As the film says, you can't prove it, but you can't disprove it. What a wild and food for thought concept that we could be reincarnated and the eyes could be the proof. The iris recognition only recognizes (as far as we know) maybe 5 million or more people in the world. Out of those people who knows whose eyes might or might not come up as someone else's who died(and if they did, we would never hear about it, it would be kept under wraps). But just imagine if 7 billion people had the iris recognition, who knows who may or may not have someone else's eyes and indeed be reincarnated. Absolutely brilliant, brilliant! Again, Like the character says 'you can't prove it, but you can't disprove it either.' After the credits roll, there is an extra scene that provides more food for thought, however I could have done without this scene, in a way it kind of took a little bit away from the magic and mysticism of this film, but at the same time it wasn't too bad either as it was interesting and could have been true as well as Iris Recognition first began(they say) in the late 1920's. Mike Cahill directed and wrote a beauty here, his opus. I Origins is a wonderful, beautiful film that is most definitely worth watching."
" A clever sci fi movie that is pretty calm and yet keeps one's attention
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,9,"I loved this movie. I see many people complaining about it being a movie where religion defeats science, but I didn't see it this way. It is a sci fi movie. Fi stands for fiction as we know it. It is not supposed to be a documentary on evolution and biology but include a story about something that is now what we can see being proved by science.Second, the ending is open for interpretation. And I liked it. The test fails. The girl is afraid of the elevator, but so what? Kids are afraid of many things that can be a coincidence. I actually loved the scene of the test being done. I am an atheist. And when the movie started and I got the main theme I thought that hopefully it is not about religion defeating science. Yet there I was watching the girl after several correct answers giving incorrect ones and feeling a weird disappointment. At the end when Karen asks Ian how he felt he says ""kind of foolish"", this is basically what I did too. And then there was still a part of me hoping that the girl will say something that will see us a Sofi being part of her. And she did it with the elevator. And I think it Sofi, yet as I said keeps our interpretation open. For all we know she is just claustrophobic.Another thing is that I think it is supposed to simply say that there is so much more out there that we can't explain yet. That can be scientific and proved by data but that we don't even imagine. And I am not talking about God. Science just keeps developing and one day people may be studying things that we can't imagine now. And it will be a scientist like Ian, who is willing to go and test something to make sure that what he doesn't believes in is incorrect instead of dismissing it.To me the movie wasn't predictable. I didn't see the trailer before watching it and just read a one sentence description. So luckily for me the main idea and what will happen weren't open from the start which made the movie more enjoyable. The acting was perfect. I liked how incredibly natural these people felt to me. The main character also being so complex. He isn't dull as people referred to him. He is normal. But being normal includes so many parts. He is the guy who believes in data but just for the hell of it follows the number 11. His attitude towards the female characters of the movie and changing of it. We can see him starting to respect Karen after dismissing her as a first year student he needs to get rid of. Somehow one feels the two are right for each other yet he ends up with Sofi at first, who is so different. Yet we get the passion that can make us miss the huge differences between us and the person we are with which gets to his mind in that fatal night in the elevator, as he then describes it to Karen. His character is important to the drama romance part of the movie and represent the humanity so well.The little girl Kashish playing Salomina was also good and it is her first part! I love how vivid her face was when she was answering the questions in the hotel room.Well, the movie was sure impressive. I just don't get why Ian didn't contact Dr. Simmons to talk about what she is researching. But this could be because he wanted to try first his own thing. And this way also getting a closure that he said he was missing after Sofi's death. I will look out for more work of the director and the actors as I was impressed."
" Very disappointing science fiction
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,1,"I rarely write reviews here, but as a fan of science fiction, I am compelled to warn potential viewers about this movie. In the first half of the movie I was able to suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride, but eventually the movie became ""spiritual"". This not necessarily a bad thing, but it is not handled well at all here. I expect that any true science fiction fan will also be sorely disappointed, but those who need their religious views supported will probably find the movie enjoyable."
" too many plot holes
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,4,"The idea is good, the filming is good but there it ends for I origin...acting was poor and there were way too many holes in the plot and unbelievable moments.-Nurse saying when this happens you just do it again...so it happened before??? -So you reboot a system and then a database match that was found before isn't found anymore...strange. -A teacher who hasn't seen a girl for months remembers the details of her eye? -A 7-year old street-child sees the eyes and knows they her's -No security system in an elevator? -the made up reason he doesn't want to take the elevator with the girl the first time -You get name with a database match but the owner of the database company can't see the names? -The fact that they can give a worm light-sensitive cells triggers an iris scanning-industry??I can go on and oncommon, it is beyond believable and it destroys the movie...too bad"
" One of the best movies to describe how science works!
",2017-05-31 00:00:00,10,"Besides having some very relatable characters, which goes through some harsh times in their lives, this movie is also one of (if not) the best movie(s) to describe how science works and how a scientist should think when he/she discovers a pattern which is hard to ignore even though it's what we would describe as ""otherworldly""."
" The loss of someone young
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,10,"Beautiful movie... I have recently lost my father. When there was the line ''Every person has its own universe'' in the movie, the light in my room flickered. Mike Cahill and Brit Marling understand grief. I don't know if they have ever lost someone young, but they manage to express these feelings in a very accurate way. Also in ''Another Earth'', they give what could be psychological solutions for people who remain damaged for the rest of their lives after a loss. When I watched ''Another Earth'' I had only suffered loss of relationships and I still found myself. Only a meeting with yourself can save you. It is not as easy to apply when someone dies... In ''I Origins'' it really gives the only solution that could make life bearable after losing someone young... knowing for sure that their conscience goes on and continues living, more than any survival of the spirit or other notions we use to explain the passing of someone dear, knowing that they go on to live on Earth...."
" Pseudo-clever mediocre movie about interesting concepts
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,4,"Let me start by saying that i might be biased, since I studied molecular biology, and people tend to be especially harsh with movies portraying their own field of knowledge in an unrealistic way.With that out of the way, lets be quite clear about one thing: absolutely everything that has anything to do with science in this movie makes absolutely no sense at all.I don't want to bore anyone with scientific details, but even ignoring the pretentious pseudo-scientificness, its fundamental premise about disproving god scientifically makes about as much sense as the fundamental premise of the matrix about machines using people as a source of energy.So what we end up with is a movie that tries very hard to come across as deep and clever, but ends up being pretentious and shallow. The acting is OK, the pacing is okayish, the shaky cam annoyed me at times, but the general visual style of the movie is pretty slick, and the dialogue - apart from the times they try to sound like scientists - is definitely above average.4/10 - good conversation starter, since it tackles interesting topics, but ultimately a mediocre movie that tries too hard to come across as clever."
" everything after he found Samolina seemed unrealistic and forced
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,7,"First, when he found her he should've waited for Priya to accompany him for the ""test. He shouldn't have taken her to his hotel room like that. Second, they didn't use the elevator while going up but he wanted to use it while coming down? That doesn't make any sense. Also, the test could've done in a much better way. It was flawed in every sense. The ending seemed inconclusive at best. What was the thing with the guy Ian met in the elevator? What about the lady that did the test on Tobias? Why didn't they find her? She essentially lied to them about a test and they didn't take any action against her.I enjoyed the movie but the story had a lot of untapped potential."
" Not impressed with the story but good acting
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,3,"So the beginning was good and cute....and then out of nowhere they killed off the most likable character extremely unnecessarily. What's even worse is that although she was in the start of the film she doesn't have a place in the IMDb synopsis, probably because of how irrelevant she became. Me and my brother stopped watching after she died because it was so uncalled for, I understand when show's like The Walking Dead kill off main characters to show us how hard their life is but it really winds me up when the producers feel the need to include it in these movies where it just isn't needed. It ruined the whole film for me, it was as though she was introduced to be killed off.The way she died was awful as well, instead of having her legs crushed off couldn't they have just let the elevator fall so we don't have to see all that gore. I don't understand why they felt the need to kill her off anyway and it was horrible that the movie moved so quickly afterwards...Ian gets together with his lab partner, they publish a book, they become famous and have a child...then it starts to slow down a little. Why change the pace like that? It's so annoying. I am really disappointed because of how it well it was going.The reason I gave this film 3 stars is because although they unnecessarily killed off the sweetest character the acting was good. I would have much preferred the film if they didn't kill her and allowed the relationship to blossom. It would have been a lot better being a romance than a sci-fi that feels the need to include this random death.RIP Sofi"
" Not for everyone
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,8,"IMDb rating is 7, on web people mostly bash it, but it moved me totally. This drama, with elements of romance, adventure, SF, and even horror, is easy to follow, but heavy if it hits you right. I understand why most people hate it. The movie is good, but it definitely isn't for everyone.8/10"
" Another religious propaganda...
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,3,"Well, it starts somehow interesting, it has some good acting moments, but from the start I sensed there will be some major religious bullshit at the and, and I was right about it. The eye, one of the fallacies religious people use to prove their imaginary friends, used here as well to somehow connect it with a soul, which was a total disaster. Typical straw man argument, this movie is offensive to common sense. To bad, because everything else was nice."
" It is hard to create art out of nonsense
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,4,"If this film inspires someone to even check the Wikipedia articles on reincarnation and on the evolution of the eye, then it has that much merit. I loved Cahill's Another Earth for it's poetic absurdity. To appreciate it's story of love, loss and loneliness one just had to pretend to accept for the duration the silly notion of a copy of our planet existing just a little way off out there. I Origins has pretty much the same agenda of love and loss and the human desire to overcome death somehow. I expected him to elaborate these themes. This time Cahill unfortunately loses it on page one of his own script. A premise of the film is that the human eye is the crown of creation or the finest product of evolution and somehow the home of the eternal human soul. This is a lot of weight on a very mediocre, merely adequate sensory organ. Should some God have designed the perfect eye, the bad news is that He/She gave it to a marine crustacean, the mantis shrimp. We got the budget model that was not good enough for the peregrine falcon nor the dragonfly. If Cahill had ever watched Animal Planet, he would have already known this and rewritten his obsessive script. Ridley Scott is an example of a director who can get off unpunished for some bad, really bad science in his films, after all they are works of fiction. But Cahill does not let the story flow as he did in Another Earth, he just keeps repeating the same silly notions. When we get to the reincarnation-like or rebirth-hinting part of the story, it turns out that Cahill does not understand this concept very well either. The obtrusive music and the very slow pace of the film did not help. I did like the ending a lot. Perhaps one day a rewrite will be made and the ending will get a worthy film preceding it."
" ""I Origins"" is an insult to one's intelligence!
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,1,"The film starts with the focus on evolution of the human eye – but ends up using the eye to search for possible Reincarnations. What a stupid joke!This film is supposed to be Sci-Fi, but it is actually not! Another insulting joke!A research student, Ian Gray (played by Michael Pitt), has a scientific bent of mind who believes only in Proofs – not some fictitious Intelligent Design to explain away the world around us.He comes in contact with Sofi (Àstrid Bergès-Frisbey) who is mystical-minded and a theist. Her exotic eyes became the center of Ian's attraction. From here on, the film became less about human eye evolution and more about matching of Iris scans of known diseased people with others in a database, for a possibility of Reincarnation. The so-called Scientist in Ian Gray mutates into a ""hippy"".""I Origins"" clearly comes across as a pretentious, shallow film based on this Frivolous idea! Phewwhat a waste of time.On second thoughts, even with this ""frivolous idea"" the film could have been made more thrilling and engaging. It is the Presentation which matters more than the Idea. That is why a reviewer here, ThatDoestntMatter, thoughtfully said, ""I can suspend reason for a film, if it draws me in and takes me for a ride."" Agree absolutely!FUNNY PRO-I ORIGINS COMMENTSI suspect people who've liked the film are theists suffering from Delusions!They have created a false air of Gravity and Greatness around the film.1. ""Absolutely original, and very powerful"" (Original yes, but Powerful no)2. ""The constant battle between science and religion shown in a beautiful way."" (this so-called ""battle"" is shown in an ordinary manner – nothing to get carried away with)3. ""Beautiful actors seeking answers to profound questions"" (What ""profound questions""? That so-called Spirituality can debunk Science by way of Reincarnation through Iris matching? LOL!)4. ""Soulful blend of science, religion, and romance"" (it is actually ""kitschful"" blend of the three)PS: Have something to say to me? Shoot a mail to inforaza@gmail.com"
" Not SCI-FI
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,2,"This movie is not sci-fi, it's about romance and (it can be an SPOILER) religious/spiritual issues. (No more Spoilers)It have not science fundamentals. The last half is hard to view, almost nothing unpredictable happens. It's a soft drama romantic movie for hipsters and new age lovers."
" intriguing premise but second half stumbles
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,6,"Ian Gray (Michael Pitt) is a PHD student in New York. At a Halloween party, he meets a mysterious girl. He takes a picture of her eye as he often does. She leaves before getting her name. With only a picture of her eye, he finds her from a billboard leading him to spiritual model Sofi (Astrid Bergès-Frisbey). He's researching a way to make color-blind mice see color. Karen (Brit Marling) is his new first-year student assistant. They start a project to create eyes on an animal without eyes showing the evolution of the eye and to debunk Intelligent Design.The premise is intriguing. The story starts well. It is ambitious in its subject matter. The film is solid up to the end of Sofi. Then it tries to do too much. Writer/director Mike Cahill is unable to corral the various ideas into a compelling story. It's obvious what it's trying to do but it struggles to make it interesting. I still give it full marks for its ambitions despite its failure to achieve its full intention."
