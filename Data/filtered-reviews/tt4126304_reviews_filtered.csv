" the only way to ""win"" the so-called War on Drugs is to decriminalize drugs
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,10,"Matthew Heineman's Academy Award-nominated ""Cartel Land"" is one of the most harrowing documentaries that you'll ever see. It focuses mainly on a community in Michoacán that formed a vigilante group to fight the drug gangs, since the corrupt government was no good at protecting them from the gangs. The other focus is a vigilante group in Arizona that sets out to stop the cartels from entering the US. It took some real guts to get this on screen (to say nothing of the danger that they likely faced in filming it).It just goes to show that the so-called War on Drugs is a failure at best. Not only is Mexico nearly a failed state, but the mass arrests for drug possession in the United States have devastated entire communities. Meanwhile, Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2000, and drug usage fell there.The point is that there's no way to win such a war, least of all for the people in rural Mexico. They bear the brunt of the brutality, whether from cartels or from their own government. We must end this war.In an update since the documentary's release, José Mireles died of COVID last month."
" Interesting
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,7,"There are two parts to Cartel Land, interwoven. There is an American man whom leads other vigilantes, combat style, against intrusions upon his part of the Mexico border. Another Mexican man, a local doctor, is all about forming a local militia to take back small towns in Mexico which have been overrun by the cartels. Overall the doco struck me as basically two expanded news reports such as you might see on 60 Minutes, though without a high powered journalist giving narration and overview. It is fascinating, but lacks substance on two fronts. Firstly there was very little (if any) counter views given to the activities of either the vigilantes or the militia. There is an interesting interview with an actual cartel member which introduces the documentary, but after that we hear almost nothing from them. Secondly I thought there needed to be an overview given, in some depth, of the general situation in terms of the border and the power wielded by cartels in Mexico. The overview we actual get is from the opinions of the two leading subjects, that is, the captain of the vigilantes and the captain of the militia. Mind you, in regard to the militia, things start getting really interesting toward the end, but I dread to add a spoiler. Cartel Land, I thought, should perhaps have been titled Fighting The Cartel: two stories from the front lines."
" What happend to the Autodefensa movement
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,7,"This is a documentary film that follows Autodefensa, the Mexican vigilante movement to fight the violence of the drug cartel. The leader Dr. Mireles has charisma to gain support, and the group seems to be achieving success. But then the group itself begins to corrupt.The atrocity of the cartel, called Knights Templar, is chilling, especially their killing of children. So when Mireles stands up against them and people gather around him, he is no doubt a hero. They fear retaliation, and it does happen to Mireles. But more fundamental problem emerges from inside the movement.Since it is not legitimate for them to carry weapons, nothing legally distinguish them from criminal organizations. And their reputation among the people becomes divisive. Some members openly become as violent as the cartels.One thing I really don't understand by watching this film is what exactly the police or the goverment thought of the situation. Maybe they just didn't have sufficient power to deal with it.There is a scene at the very beginning of the film, where drug cooks are working in a remote grove at night. A man is talking. ""We know we do harm with all the drugs that go there. But what are we going to do? We come from poverty. If we were doing well, we would be like you. Traveling the world or doing good clean jobs like you guys."" This words remain in my mind throughout the film like an echo. I don't know what exactly the problem is. But whatever it is, I know it is very ingrained in the society.I don't think the U.S. part is really relevant. Yes, they have a situation in common with Autodefensa where they have become vigilantes because of unreliable police. But their contexts are quite different. I believe it was necessary only to attract the U.S. audience. (And now I, not being American, fully understand why Trump appealed to the voters by the promise to build the Wall.)"
" Very powerful
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,8,"The storyline following Dr Mireles was fascinating, and very well documented. The editing is fantastic, but it is for continuation and dramatic effect. There is no editing to make up for lacking story - there is more than enough story here. The horrible situation down there is shown in much detail. And would have made a great doc on it sown. But it gets even more intriguing when the human faults enter in. How power corrupts; even the good guys. there is a powerful scene where one of the Lieutenants speaks to a town; with differing results than Mireles. There is footage documenting Mireles to be a decisive and surprisingly violent leader. And ultimately it depicts his downfall: a trait that has brought many great men down to the level of mere mortal. Great drama.
The only reason I gave it 8 stars is because the tale of Nailer on the US side, which is obviously shot to act as the counter balance on the other side is a distraction. On its own, also a good film, and interesting story. Since it never quite is developed it comes off as a nagging distraction."

" To much from US hero kind point of view

" Legalize not criminalize
",2019-11-26 00:00:00,9,"26NOV2019 {9/10 stars A) Recommend? Yes; Despite all the action and activity this movie felt a bit slow at times.Over the years I have watched a variety of shows about crime, illegal activity and law enforcement. Cops, Drugs Inc, Border Wars, Lockup, 60 Days In, Alaska State Troopers, Nightwatch, LAPD Life on the Beat.This is a very gripping documentary about the war against drugs, crime and corruption in Mexico and part of the Arizona border with Mexico. A lot of Spanish speaking in this movie and reading subtitles for those that don't understand Spanish.Amazing and appalling how the cartels infiltrate and corrupt groups like Autodefensa and the government to protect the cartel drug operations. In the long run it would have been better if Autodefensa had never been started so it's public image couldn't be misused by cartel. Considering how easily the cartel pay off government and police and infiltrate the government it's unlikely anything will change for the better to slow or stop the drug cartels.Some reviews have questioned the authenticity about some or all of the content in this movie. Because you are reading reviews, you have access to the internet. You can just as easily research most of the content in this movie on the internet and see for yourself what is accurate.Any and all drugs should be legal, regulated and taxed just like alcohol and cigarettes. Give people the free choice how they want to live their lives. The smart people who want to live long productive lives will avoid drugs just the same as alcohol and cigarettes. Do a web search for ""countries that have legalized drugs."" The U.S. government loves the war on drugs because it brings lots of tax money for the government and law enforcement.CONTENT ADVISORY: Hostage situations shown and described, video showing the aftermath of brutal violence including decapitated heads and a dead body with blood running out like a river, a lot of gun fire, physical altercations, smoking of cigarettes, blatant and admitted adultery by one of the movie subjects.{1=F 2=D- 3=D 4=C- 5=C 6=B- 7=B 8=A- 9=A 10=A+}"
" Documentary
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,7,"Documentary shooting techniques, let people feel more real. The causes of any social problem are very complex. Once the underlying rules are formed, it is impossible to change them without overthrowing them. The United States is like a vampire, draining the resources of the surrounding countries."
" Liberal Hollywood propaganda
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,3,"This is NOT a documentary. It's liberal Hollywood garbage that is trying to hide under the ruse of a legitimate documentary. It's all staged folks, watch it again and take a closer look. Whatever your views on immigration and border security, don't let this lame film influence you."
" Stunning footage with a misguided narrative
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,5,"I've been following the story of Michiacan's Autodefensas almost from the moment they began popping up in the news. This is is a bad documentary.Good first, the footage is really amazing. It's one thing to do interviews and capture some funerals, bloody sceneries, etc. It's another to capture several firefights. Props to the crew for their courage.That's about it. I've heard the director during an interview say something along the lines of ""By the end I realized there weren't any good people in this battle"". And it's completely understandable how the viewer can arrive at that conclusion just from watching the doc.The reality is so much more complex than the director portrays and I don't know if he's simple minded or if it's done in bad faith to create a more shocking story. The rise of the autodefensas is fundamentally a story of a government that did a terrible job of defending its citizens against organized crime. In their desperation to rid their cities of cartel activity some municipalities in Michoacán gave their support to a rival cartel which displaces the original, splits in two, and after the smoke clears stations itself in these municipalities as the Caballeros Templarios cartel. They charged quotas on all exchanges and properties, controlled the markets and supply, charged kids to go to school, killed people over police reports... Cornered by their desperation and tactical misfires, civilians took up arms. Farmers, teachers, lemon pickers, doctors. People who were completely untrained in combat. Those were the autodefensas, and their sole purpose was to remove the Templarios. Some municipalities made awful choices. Others like Hipólito Mora's La Ruana are as heroic a modern day tale as you'll find. Their eventual crumbling, lapses of judgment, anger, paranoia, disorder, corruption, should not come as a surprise.The documentary offers a very shallow skimming of this context. It promises to do a fair take of this initially, and only the filmmakers could answer why they decided to ultimately share a narrative of what they see as monstrosities committed on all sides, as if there were a moral equivalence between the cartels and the autodefensas. This is insultingly simplistic. I'll end with a shoutout to the comically misguided juxtaposition they tried to pull between the border vigilantes fighting a near nonexistent problem and the autodefensas."
" Eye opening
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,9,"We are safe in our cities, in our homes and at our jobs for the most part. Then a film as this shows how everyday life in a Mexican village, town and city is so terrorized by cartels. No humanity and all over drugs and money. There is no doubt - evil exist and the good honest Mexican people are paying with pure terror of any day, any time, anywhere and anyone will be the cartels next victim. How sad for mankind to be so brutal to it's own kind."
" Intense and Informative
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,7,"If you don't know anything about the Mexican drug cartels and want to, this is a movie to watch. Its well-shot and well put together. As an American, I learned some shocking and horrible things from this movie. Its a decent documentary, though a few scenes look a little staged. Even if they weren't, I was left scratching my head wondering how they got the shots. Its a good movie, and succeeds at what its trying to do. I'd recommend it to someone who wants to learn about this kind of thing, but otherwise probably not."
" Excellent Documentary! This documentary
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,10,"There are many reviews on here that are ridiculous and simply based in idiocrasy! There are actually people docking the documentary because it films a U.S. vigilante/border patrol guy from an observational perspective, who these reviewers disagree with, therefore they dock this documentary for it, whereas otherwise they claim to have enjoyed it. It just so happens that I disagree with the guy as well (or at the very least recognize what the dude is doing accomplishes nothing). This documentary does nothing to persuade the viewer to the vigilante border guy's view, rather it observes the guy telling his story. Then you get to see for yourself what this guy is doing based on his actual actions (no bias propaganda). Actually, every action that we watch the guy carry out is of him stopping some poor scared people trying to get over the border. At no point does it attempt to convince us that these scared people are cartel members or that he should be stopping these people. If anything one is more likely to disagree with the guy after seeing what he is doing for yourself. These people who are disgruntled over the observation of someone they disagree with genuinely have a serious mental disorder. Whether you agree or disagree with the guy, it's interesting to hear what his perspective is and watch exactly what he is doing. Rather than taking his or someone else's word for it. The guy convinces himself that he is doing something against the cartels even though there is nothing we see to support the guys claim... so why can't these nutball reviewers differentiate? It's simple, they have a mental disorder. Anyways, that wasn't the theme of the documentary, it's vigilantism. Two different kinds of vigilantism, but they both correlate in that they are people taking it upon themselves to act in areas where the government refuses too. However the story over the Mexican border is where this documentary excels. You should understand after seeing this, Government/Cartels are in bed together if not one of the same thing. This applies to everywhere in the world. A different word for it is used everywhere, in Mexico they're called cartels. So yes, I think this documentary captured a bunch of amazing stuff and tried to come up with a way to work both stories into the documentary. As a result, should I rate this doc a 6 or a 7 because both stories felt loosely tied to me, even though it captures what was and is going on in Mexico (and everywhere in the world I believe) unlike anything ever has before and both stories are very entertaining. In my opinion, this is the best reference that I have ever seen demonstrated before as to a pattern that continues to go on, over and over and over again throughout history. In Mexico you have the Cartels, In Russia you have the KGB, in the US we've had a bunch of ravenous groups over the years in which the government pretends to be against, but at the end of the day they do absolutely nothing to stop them and come to find out they are in bed together. So, surprise people the government (gov. is just a generic expression, but you could say the state, the CIA or the powers that be which control gov.), are the real manufacturers of these drugs (there are several instances over the years where this has been declassified information (particularly the CIA). Even though we see in this documentary, the newly united government are the ones out making the drugs (so whether the state/gov are the actual manufacturers, they are always at the very least the ghost manufacturers and get paid/kickbacks the same either way) and these horrendous gangs/cartels are the ones selling their product. This documentary demonstrates the Mexican government/military does nothing to stop the cartels and in fact come to the cartels aid. Then they show what happens to the liberation groups that wake up and fight back, they eventually get infiltrated/ convinced/paid off by the government to step aside and/or join forces and then you're right back to square one. Like that Papa Smurf clown. I'm curious if the guy was an infiltrator from the start or if he was bought off. One thing for certain is; he allowed some audience members running some cointelpro tactics to overpower him in a speech. In that instance, I believe they essentially had a handful or more of rehearsed and planned criticisms to bounces off one another in tandem, which can easily and effectively bring an entire audience who would otherwise be in support of the speakers cause, against the speaker and the cause. This stuff is taught in CIA/FBI training and I'm sure in many other gov organizations around the world. Another way is just through media control and what not, they convince the people through propaganda or whatever the ""horrible"" things that the people/liberation group are doing. In this instance, I feel certain that the crowd criticism was a planned cointelpro tactic 100% without any shadow of a doubt. Anyways, this information has been known by some people for years, but this is probably the first time that I've ever seen someone in the thick of it actually capturing it on film as it was happening they actually captured the entire process from start to finish It's amazing! This documentary (the Mexico part) is an essential demonstration of something that people really need to be aware of."
" Great, greater, greatest!
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,9,"What is most admirable in this excellent film is how Heineman risks his life in the middle of the crossfire with his camera so that he can show us this tragic, appalling and complex situation to which there seems to be no solution and where one step forward means two steps back. Watch it. Now."
" Like a drug, this documentary is also intensely highly addicting. A must watch
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,8,"Nominated for Best Documentary at the 88th Academy Awards. 2015's 'Cartel Land', is gripping. Why, because it dares to go, somewhere, where other documentaries fail to do. It goes to the frontline of the War on Drugs, outside the protection of the corrupt government, especially with vigilante groups fighting Mexican drug cartels, showing us, how brutal and violence, life can be for some, living in South of the Border. Directed by Matthew Heineman, while the movie doesn't explore, all of the fights against the cartels in Mexico. It focus on one of the most brutal gangs with Knights Templar Cartel fighting against the citizen forces of Michoacán, a Mexican state. While, most of the movie is in Spanish in places where people barely heard of, it's still a gritty well-thought story that will cross over to the majority of English speaking-America audiences, as drug trafficking has become a major problem for both countries for many years, now. Without spoiling 'Cartel Land' too much, I have to say, while the story of Autodefensas (Self-Defender Force) was very compelling, with all the raids and gun-fights sequences. Even the clashes with the Mexican government is worth the watch on its own; but I do have to say, the other story with Tim ""Nailer"" Foley and the Arizona Border Recon was not. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind, having border patrols, but their story really lack any excitement. It's borderline, boring, most of the time. It made for some really bad pacing issues, when they cut away from the intense story in Mexico to the one in Arizona. I really didn't like it. For a place that supposed to be 'the Wild West', most of the time, the group just watch television, eat BBQ and go on, nature walks, dressed up as Army Rangers, harassing illegal immigrants, just looking to get away from poverty, rather than seeking out the cartel that making these people's lives, horrible. I also don't like, how cocky and badass, they think they are. They don't know, how lucky, they are, compare to the people living in Michoacán, where gunfights on the streets, and people getting their heads cut off is a common occurrence. Their quiet little town, might be near the border, but it's still far away from 'Cartel Land' as it gets. The idea that U.S. government have failed to protect the citizens of the border towns from Mexican gang violence is just absurd. It's safer, here, than it is, in Mexico, five times over. Also, for a group that says, that they're not racists. The interview speech about fences says, otherwise. Also, based on what this documentary is presenting, I don't think the leader of Arizona Border Recon is doing this, as a righteous cause, like he says it is. Instead, it felt like he was doing this, for selfish, cocky reasons, looking for scapegoat outlet for his past drug abuse and father issues. He seem insane and a psycho. Its things like this that made the Arizona Border Recon parts, cringe-worthy. Don't get me wrong, the leaders of Autodefensas were equally as unethical as the Arizona Border Recon, but they felt more necessary roughs in the edge, because, how they truly do live in a hellhole. So, to see them, order murders, breaking and entertaining, beating and torturing their capturers. It felt less, shocking, because how truly, war-like the failed nation has become. While, the movie doesn't show, much of the Autodefensas flaws at first. Overtime, they became just as dark as the criminals, they sworn to fight against. Because of this, I don't believe that Dr. José Manuel Mireles Valverde and the second in command who doesn't want, his real-life name out, Papa Pituno, aka Papa Smurf are just not the heroes, the film first portrayal them to be. Seeing Dr. Mireles cheat on his marriage, do nothing to stop the corruption, and abandoned the cause, basically show, how easily, human beings in this nation can lose their way. The lack of concern for human life is staggering and it shows. It's f-up, as much as the corruption. The twist toward the end, shows that. It's bitter & depressing. Overall: While, some of the footage can be extremely graphic that can make some viewers sick. I do have to give mad props for the filmmakers of this film has taken great personal risks to get the footage to US audiences, as it brings great insight on how violence, life is, over there. In the end, this is one powerful documentary that everybody need to see."
