A kid's meal version of City of God, but I mean this in the most endearing and affirming manner. I'm actually a bit shocked to see Trash sitting at a mostly average rating average amongst mutuals, but then again also see how it can be a film not easy to fully relate to for non-Brasilians. While not necessarily fully relying on the brutality of the circumstance, it is still a film of intensive subject matter. It doesn't focus in the central depiction of the criminal underworld or Favelas like Elite Squad or aforementioned City of God. It's not exclusively a crime film, more so even playing out as an endearing slice of life underdog drama. Trash does do a commendable job at showcasing what and where these kids go and live through, all while still managing to infuse a steady comedic - almost inspiring - silver lining, carried by the child acting.I could go on a rant about the injustices, corruption, crime, and brutality of Brasil, and how it makes many more popularly televised social-activist movements like in the State, seem like nothing. But I won't, because much like Beasts of the Southern Wild (and what Wendy looks like), Trash captures that childlike wonder and innocence within situations no kid should have to endure. I haven't read the novel that Trash is adapted from, but I felt very moved by this personal film and the harrowing journey that these three first time actor(?) kids go through: their sense of brotherhood, perseverance, will, and genuine smiles just warm the heart. Being a mostly British production, it does have to be said that certain aspects do feel like they have been cleaned up, refined, and limited in their raw nature, perhaps in attempts to make it more widely marketable crowd-pleaser รก la Slumdog Millionaire - a film I have still never seen. Regardless, it's still the type of story that makes you acknowledge how good *you* may have it, and in my case more grateful for the sacrifices my parents made to supply better opportunities. So in a way, I can see how this film might not work entirely for everyone, but I for one certainly loved it.The film does have supporting roles from Brasilian heavyweights Wagner Moura and Selton Mello, with box office incentives,Rooney Mara and Martin Sheen, but is predominantly focused on the very charismatic Brasilian child actors. It's mostly in Portuguese, although does feature moments of English, which do serve as some more cheerful downtime between Mara and Sheen teaching the kids and vice versa. I was very appreciative of both Mara and Sheen putting a willing effort into having full conversations in my native tongue - seeing how from my experience, Portuguese is one of the harder languages to pull off. Frankly, that alone made Mara all the more of a crush, on top of the big one I've already had on her for a while."
" Magnificent
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,10,"A must see movie! It keeps your interest and agony throughout the movie and you definitely love those kids. Their acting is stunning and the setting in Rio's favelas makes it so realistic. You will see yourself again a teenager running with these young boys. Playful, amusing and sad at the same time with a lot of things to say about the political situation in Brazil."
" Dark Goonise of Brazil
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,9,"Start with Narcos, Goonise in Brazil, then finish of the Shawshank Redemption."
" Good film
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,8,"Local teenagers, three of whom live in poverty, have led to a serious imbalance between rich and poor across Brazil. And through their unsophisticated looks and innocent reactions, they symbolise the deep roots of Brazilian society, but also the promise of youth. No matter how complicated the world is, some things can still be seen as pure, like the accidental involvement of three teenagers in a corruption case. They are probably not quite sure how to write about corruption. They are purely persistent and good, and they are willing to take risks for it."
" Netflix Hidden Gem!
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,8,"Stumbled onto the film browsing the Netflix thrillers section. Glad I gave it a chance. Had a little bit of everything. Action, adventure, comedy and drama. Cool story and great acting. Definitely worth a watch."
" Don't let the title fool you
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,8,"This is one of the best i have ever seen , amazing plot twist and the story is breathtaking, those kids are great actors , they really did very good job, i watched the movie 3 or 4 times by now and i really enjoyed it"
" The kids carry the picture
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,7,"Big name actors: Martin Sheen, Rooney Mara and Wagner Moura (the Brazilian cinema's Tom Hanks), fine as they are in this film, take a back seat to the three main kids. The youngsters are very good in their roles, which take up most of the screen time. But the story needs a lot of ""suspension of disbelief"" on the part of the audience. At one point it really was much too far-fetched for me. But there were so many positives that I just said ""Oh well, I'm even going to overlook this nonsense, and just enjoy the rest."""
" GO AND MAKE A REVOLUTION
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,10,This film was best in every department. Strong political story with a journey and fight for justice all characters done their job very weel DI Colour of this film was soo cool overall a fantastic movie
" Cinema that reflects reality and still entertains
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,9,"My boyfriend has been trying to get me to watch this movie for months. We finally got the chance to sit down and watch it two weeks ago. I was so tired, so even though we began to watch it I planned on falling asleep. My oh my, I could not close my eyes for even a second because it was so captivating. This movie was such a breath of fresh air from the American movies I am used to watching. It takes you into Brazil's world of crime, poverty and corruption and somehow makes you want to stay there. The connection that you form with the characters is so strong - from the three little children that are on a relentless journey for prosperity, to the young, white American woman who wants to help, to the pope that continues to wear himself out all in an effort to build up his community - this movie has you rooting for these characters from beginning to end. The hopping around of languages in the movie is no barrier to your entertainment. If anything, it makes you pay more attention and increases your focus because you don't want to miss anything that is said. This movie was not only entertaining and told the story of how millions across the world are living (risking their lives everyday in hopes for a better life) it also taught me so much about a country that I have never visited. I not only loved this movie, I appreciated it and am looking forward to watching more movies like this one!"
" The color of Brazil
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,10,"Brazil Corruption Child force Marvelous! One of the most exciting films, with a fast action. Like good books, you will not want it to end. The performance of the children stands out.Few times you can translate the reality and contrasts of a country as achieved in this film.Delicious from start to finish, it will catch you"
" This is fascinating.
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,8,"As a tale of young teens struggling against corrupt forces within a culture of poverty, 'Trash' is a captivating tale of determination, ingenuity, and moral vision. The production values are particularly high here, which I can't help but consider against the squalid conditions that are portrayed. The story moves along with lots of twists and a complex set of clues to unraveling a mystery, giving the kids credit for their intelligence.There's always facile criticisms to be made of wealthy white movie studios shooting films that exploit ""Third World"" concerns, so if your politics demand such sanctimony, you should turn to homegrown dramas that you can claim as authentic. If you want a well-made adventure offering hope to children who earn deliverance on their own within realistic circumstances, there are not many better than this."
