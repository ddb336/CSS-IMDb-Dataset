Its unique..
This movie is liked by unique audience who just watch films for a different kind of story and narration..

" Overrated
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,2,"This movie was a torture to be honest. But as usual it is overrated by the fans of the main actor. Casting was poor, dialogues were artificial and forced. The lead actress was annoying and I don't understand why indian movies continuesly portray women as dumb. The thread could have been executed way better.
Not recommended"

" Most underrated movie
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,10,Nenokkadine is belongs to few of the most underrated movies in telugu. Mahesh Babu did a magnificent performance throughout the movie. Sukumar's direction was a path breaking for upcoming new directors with new concepts.
" Mind Blowing Brilliance
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,10,This is just a sheer brilliance from south India with a feel of Hollywood taking & screenplay. Waiting for more such movies from India.
" Nenokkadine - Mahesh Babu & Kirti Sanon
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,7,Mahesh Babu a rockstar want to know his parents death reason and villain try to make him look like mad in world
" A Milestone for Indian film future.
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,10,"Not only for Tollywood,it's a true milestone for all Indian film industries future.
But one thing is very important that's to making this kinda movies need a hero like Hollywood level & unfortunately there is only one hero available in whole India currently i mean Mahesh babu..Just imagine deeply, do u think is there anyone currently available like him.
Personality, style, dialouge speech style,expression in situation.. no no in my opinion there is no one available right now."
" Hollywood movie in Tollywood
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,10,"This movie is not one time watching movi , this is two times watched movie repeatedly"
" Nice plot but with lot of things unrealistic
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,6,Although the idea was quite great but still have a feeling that it could have been executed in a better way ... Action was completely unrealistic ..hero single handedly tackling lot of enemies and He is freely using guns in London and London police is sleeping ....lolz
" Overkill of fighting and chasing scenes without giving any attention to the storyline
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,3,"Every five minutes, Gautam(Mahesh Babu) has to fight someone. Every ten minutes, either he is chasing or being chased by someone. Just cut these scenes and this close to 3 hours film will reduce to 1 and a half. And then, there are songs to.A film without a love story can not exist in India. So here we have Kriti Sanon, playing Sameera, a part time news reporter and part time lover, in her debut venture. She has no role but to remain with Gautam throughout the film taking all the risks even if she don't know much about him. Just count how many films this cliche had destroyed. This is getting out of hand now.The final 10-12 minutes of the film were worth everything. The scene was beautifully shot, Mahesh Babu's acting was cherry on top. It's like the rest of the film is directed by someone else."
" One of the greatest Thriller movies ever made
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,10,I am proud to say that for the very first time the Indian film has come out of the box from the past few decades.Excellent Direction and absolutely great execution and screenplay.. Love you Sukumar
" A totally unexpected story ever made!
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,10,Bringing a medical condition and converging it with a revenge story in this way is totally a unique concept i have ever seen. Such movies are worth awards... The screenplay does not let your attention go off even for a second ! Fantabulous and must watch movie... Highly recommended!
" Masterpeice movie
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,9,Different kind of script and master piece acting by super star. The only flaw I found is the more action sequences. The climax is one of the best ever directed in Telugu film industry. Music is ultimate especially background score.
" Definitely overrated but decent
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,7,"Decent movie with facepalm action scenes and really long. I watched Rangasthalam movie(directed by sukumar) which is almost perfect, well structured film. Rangasthalam made me watch this movie. Nenokkadine does has good plot and twists but there is a ton of boring and unwanted scenes. The movie has a runtime of almost 3 hrs but It might be really enjoyable if it's a 120 mins movie. 3 hour movie can be divided into first 120 mins which is confusing, slow and boring movie and the next 60 mins into a good movie. Chases and fight sequences are full of cringe worthy. I had a huge expectation for this movie. Sub par with my expectations, still a decent movie. Watch the movie!!!"
" A Revolution in Indian Cinema!
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,10,Telugu first Visual Stunning and plot oriented movie. This teach us film making and what is Cinema.Its not a shock for box-office disappointment. Telugu people are became routine like Telugu movies. But nobody kill movie in history like in theatres. It lives forever.
" Absolute sheer brilliance from director Sukumar!
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,8,A new trend film for tollywood. One of a best psychological thriller. Great twists and turns in this movie. Salute Mahesh babu for choosing these kind of a different content. Mahesh acting was brilliant.1: Nenokkadine - Excellent movie of Mahesh babu for sure!
" Nenokkadine movie rating
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,10,ðŸ’“ warming movie that I had never seen in my life.I hope that these type of movies are to be encouraged rather than routine movies in this and for future generations
" Must watch movie
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,10,This movie is i think one of the best movie i have ever watched.. Beautiful acting and damn its thrill... Every character here in the movie is great but one think seems illogical here is mahesh babu fighting with weapon loaded bodyguard in a open place... EXCEPT that over action scene every thing is just perfect....
" Cult Movie.. A Masterpiece
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,10,No comparisons to this movie... only 1.. one of a kind.. the Number 1
" A master piece always with a choice
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,10,Through out the film. Mahesh character always leaves the audience with 2 choices. After every choice you are left with an another question.
" Movie must be called Awesome
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movie to show the power of a industry and It's talent...
It couldn't have been reached the Regional people and be A hit... But this movie Stole hearts of Many Movie Likers and Also applause from other industries... Screenplay never Disappointing..."

",2018-11-20 00:00:00,7,"This is a movie which has been making the headlines since the release of its first and second teasers. the director and other crew members were saying this will be a different movie and mahesh babu himself said that this will be one of his best films .
Must watch for all the film lovers 7/10"

" Better than most Telugu action films but that isn't telling much
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,4,"Better than the usual Telugu masala action flicks. The style is somewhat trying to be like Hollywood thrillers but hasn't quite let go of the Telugu masala film aesthetics. The technical side s impressive but falls down when they settle for usual commercial tropes and making any of it useless. The plot is unnecessarily convoluted but for a commercial Telugu action film, this is quite an experiment and commendable that it got an actual plot unlike many of those films. As much as I love the eye-candy of the film Kriti Sanon, her scenes were just dragging the rest of the film which is already overlong."
" Commercial elements spoiled the film
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,6,"The entire movies revolves around the psychological problems of the lead actor. It is an unconventional film among out of the mill scripts of Telugu cinema. The cinematography and music are top-notch.The story is gripping, but screenplay has been deliberately spoiled to add commercial elements. The love track has little significance in the overall story. You can sleep during the entire Goa episode, and can still understand the main plot. The stunts and item song are not relevant at some places.The director Sukumar should have taken care of the screenplay, but he focused mainly on easter eggs which add no value to the overall plot. It's a potential movie, but spoiled just to match the commercial image of Mahesh. It'd probably have been a blockbuster if made faithful to the original theme."
" Do NOT fall for IMDb rating!! Not worth watching!
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,4,"I was browsing randomly on IMDb to see if I can find a movie to watch. Recently I watched 'Vikram Vedha' and got impressed beyond my expectation. I used to think they make only masala movies. So, I came here looking for similar movies. Then I came across this movie. I was so excited seeing the IMDb rating. Though I knew the lead actor is known for doing masala movies, I thought maybe he did one good movie in his career. But, oh boy, I was so wrong! This is the same old s***, just in a different packet. Story has many flaws, acting is awful (especially the side characters) . The protagonist is as usual a Godlike person who can fight 20 men alone without getting a scratch. I still cannot fathom how he was shot at by ~20 people simultaneously in an open space but not a single bullet hit him. I expected to watch a serious movie, not this funny-yet-distasteful movie. To put things into perspective, The Usual Suspects (1995) is rated 8.6 on IMDb. If you think you are going to see a movie on a similar level to this masterpiece, I am sorry to say you will regret later. I just gave it a 4* just because it has a story (though with many flaws) unlike most South Indian movie and special effects were on satisfactory level."
" BEST TELUGU THRILLER MOVIE EVER INDEED BEST TELUGU MOVIE EVER
",2018-01-30 00:00:00,10,"It is the fabulous film which will make you sit on the edge of the seat while watching the film.The best screenplay ever in indian movies,not less than any hollywood thriller with heart touching emotion in the film."
" 1 - Nenokkadine (2014)
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,6,The movie was good. BGM was good in the movie. Fight scenes were amazing in the movie. The movie was very thrilling and interesting. Mahesh Babu acted very well in the movie. But the climax could be more better.
" BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN
",2017-12-18 00:00:00,10,This is totally different movie in the timeline of Indian cinema
