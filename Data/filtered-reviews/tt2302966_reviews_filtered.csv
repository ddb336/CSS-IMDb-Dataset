" Different movie
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,9,The movie is very different from usual movies. I liked it very much.
" ""I"" is only watchable for Vikram's performance and Shankar's larger-than-life visuals
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,5,"Vikram is one of the most versatile actors in Tamil Cinema. His dedication and his hard work went to a whole new level in Shankar's ""I"". The romantic action thriller has been among the most anticipated films because it's Vikram and Shankar's reunion after their successful collaboration in the action thriller Anniyan. Just like their previous work, ""I"" depends again on Vikram's versatile performance. He is the heart and soul of this film. He holds us tight with his different looks, mannerisms, and his body language which works brilliantly on screen. He shows two different variations of voice modulation as Lingesan the bodybuilder and Lingesan the hunchback which is clearly Vikram's hard work. The way that he carries his character throughout the film helps us get along with him in the journey. After Vikram, ""I"" stands a grandeur film for its technical work and A.R.Rahman's musical score. Except for their work, ""I"" fails hardly to create any impact because of its weak screenplay. Shankar has added in so many subplots and flashbacks which slows down the overall pace of the film. The main flashback is intercut with Vikram's revenge-taking scenes which creates confusion while watching. We can simply call it incoherent because the film deviates from story to story. Every character has unnecessary backstories which lack serious impact in the main plot. Shankar seems to have focused more on the presentation rather than its writing because the film lacks depth. It's the same old revenge drama that is covered up with colorful cinematography and visual effects. Usually, Shankar films have something get from it. For example, Gentleman, Indian, and Anniyan had a strong social message to get while Nanban and Boys were strictly for youths. Unfortunately, ""I"" is nothing more than a simple revenge story elevated by Shankar's creative touches and Vikram's heart-touching performance. Speaking about the runtime, the slow screenplay reduces the engagement factor of the film. We don't get any exciting moments or interesting plot points. Maybe the visually pleasing song sequences are breathtaking times for the audience. Other than that, Shankar left us with some scenes that I don't want to comment on it. Overall, ""I"" is only watchable for Vikram's performance and Shankar's larger-than-life visuals."
" Such a great love & revenge.....
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,10,"Vikram, Shankar,Amy Jackson a group of geniuses. When this kind of group meets this kinda results come out........"
" Amazing
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,10,"Perfect story line I would say a 10 because of the way they made this movie
Simply amazing would highly
Recommend this to everyone to watch"
" Revenge is best served cold
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,8,"What worked:
It's a revenge movie and an interesting one. I did not watch the movie with any expectations so it was enjoyable for the most part. The concept is cool and the movie keeps its narrative around the concept. All the acts of revenge feels cathartic and justifiable which is why it is an enjoyable watch
What did not work:
The run time definitely needs to be cut down by clipping down many songs, scenes and narratives. It's a typical South Indian movie in a sense it has alll the flavors to be called so. The screenplay could be made better by cutting it down.
Final verdict: recommended"
" Pure Bliss !! Hats off Shanker and Vikram
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,10,Vikram proves again why he is the most Versatile actor in India.
" EPIC & WELL MADE
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,9,"I usually don't write reviews but I'll have to say that this is ONCE IN A LIFETIME MOVIE.
'I' from SHANKAR is surely a MASTERPIECE & deserves STANDING OVATION for it's EPICNESS.
I would like to thank Shankar for making SCIENCE FICTION MOVIES & giving Indian Cinema a new touch.
this is totally a mind-blowing movie.. in India this type of movies are always rare so i will give it 9/10 & CHIYAAN VIKRAM WAS PHENOMENAL .. WHAT A TRANSFORMATION MAN!👌"
" Filmfare Award Alone are Not Enough
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,10,"The first time I saw Shankar's extraordinary performance in the film Enth estimates (2010). The first time I saw, I felt that Shankar was not just a director, but a scientist! He has made an extraordinary film that is extraordinary! When I saw his performance for the second time in film 2.0 (2018), that's where I was really sure that Rajnikanth was not with a director at the time, but a scientist and ... a witch!""I"" has been released for years. But, that doesn't matter. As long as the director is a Shankar. I watched this film and found that ""I"" was a surprise! Even though I expected more respect than ""I"", in my eyes ""I"" was an atomic bomb! At that moment, I had to change Shankar's nickname as a scientist and magician into a scientist, magician and bomb maker!I've seen Amy Jackson before in the film Singh Is Bliing (2015). As a young actress, her performance in the film was not bad either, although the quality of her acting in the film was still far behind that of other actresses her age. When I want to watch the movie ""I"", I had doubts about its performance in the film. But, my mind is clearly 100% wrong. He appeared extraordinary in the film ""I"" which is very contrary to his appearance in the film Singh Is Bliing! He did not disappoint at all. He is good at managing his emotions for each scene, and does everything extraordinary. I think he only spoke fluently in English. Again I was wrong, I saw it in the movie ""I"", he perfectly brought Tamil dialogue! Without the slightest flaw. She also performed well as an Indian woman, even though she was British.Vikram's performance, no need to compare with anyone. There is no point. Why? Yes! Because he is amazing! My advice, don't ever compare Vikram with other actors because it's just like you eat and spit it out. He is different from other superstars because he is truly extraordinary! His acting was originally a playful man who likes to fantasize, he suddenly transformed into a model that is cool and far from the previous character. This is an extraordinary transformation! That is why I began to fall in love with the extraordinary actor, Chiyaan Vikram.When I read the news that the South Korean film ""Parasite"" won an Oscar, I was furious. Not because I hate the film, but I regret that the Oscar jury did not include the film ""I"" in the list of nominations. Supposedly, this film by Shankar deserves to be nominated and even won the winner! Yes ... I know if this film has won the Filmfare Award trophy, I think it's not enough (and not even fair). Supposedly, this film also brought trophies from various prestigious awards, including Oscar.The visual effects are amazing. Different from other Indian films. In my eyes, the visual effects of this film are more amazing than the visual effects of Hollywood films. Salute to Shankar and the entire VFX team!Honestly, I don't like music by A.R Rahman. Maybe only music from the film Jab Tak Hai Jaan (2012) is what I like. But, I can't believe it. A.R Rahman's work in the film ""I"" is even more amazing than the extraordinary works in the film Jab Tak Hai Jaan. The songs really live in every scene. Really extraordinary. This is a miracle!Rating 8 or 9 alone is not enough to be the value of this film. A score of 10 is the most perfect. No need to tell, surely you know what value I gave.Don't forget to watch this movie!"
" Wonderful movie to watch
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,9,Vikram has given another master piece. Make up artist deserves great reward for his awesome effort.
" Vikram vikram vikram
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,10,"This movie keep you engaging till the end
Watch only 4 chiyaan vikram"
" What a movie title !! 😂😂😂 'I' LOL
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,1,"Movie is outstanding based on story, acting , direction, songs... Everything is fare without the title of the movie, It's really disgusting to have such name to find something in internet."
" It is amazing love story movie.
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,10,I didn't saw again that is good world most love story movie.
" Mediocre at best
",2019-11-29 00:00:00,6,"Vikram shouldn't have done this disaster of a movie.
His hard work and dedication completely wasted in this lackluster film.
Shankar's written lackluster script and even bad execution."
" A GOOD (ONE-TIME) Watch !!
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,7,"Shankar, the showman of the current generation, has presented a personal revenge story set in the glamorous world of modelling in his latest venture. While he continues his trend of pushing boundaries in terms of budget of regional movies, capturing hitherto unexplored exquisite locales (this time in China), cutting edge special effects, he has moved away from his usual social message embedded narrative featuring a lone hero/vigilante fighting societal evils.Keeping with the theme of the movie, I is the cinematic equivalent of that lavishly made, well picturised attention grabbing commercial which captivates you for the first viewing, but remains/means little else thereafter. Whether that spells success/otherwise of its maker Shankar is the big question.Speaking for myself, despite its several shortcomings - including its length of 189 minutes, a paper-thin plot lacking depth and further beset with several crater-esque perforations, cardboard-cut characters, indulgent action set pieces that lack the zing and overstay their welcome - I liked it for the way Shankar has managed to package it as an engaging entertainer with P.C. Sreeram's visual brilliance showcasing a montage of vivid and rich imagery, WETA's magic in creating very real pro(ae)sthetics, Rahman's numbers (Ennodu Nee Irundhal, Pookkale & Mersal) and above all, for the towering brilliance of its leading man,vIkram whose performance and transformations through the film are simply SUPERB."
" Not as good as I expected. Watch it for Vikram's superb acting.
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,7,"Director Shankar is one of the most outstanding directors. With films like Mudhalvan and Anniyan, he has certainly made a name for himself in Indian cinema. I is rather a normal revenge story which is filmed beautifully. Do not go in with high hopes but Vikram's acting and Ar Rahman's music will make you wonder in awe."
" Experience a extraordinary revenge love story
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,8,"It is a experience a new contained . The film was started two types story telling one side back story and other revenge story. but you can not hair in this film watching.
Movies dialauge and screenplay or cenamatograhic is outstanding. And every actor performance perfact, but vikram Sr performance are fabulous. And shankar direction extraordinary.
And the movie negative is long and illogical action scenes, but like mass audience"
" Underrated south Indian masterpiece
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,10,"Some unwanted logical minds under rated this finds in South industry
It's not a logical piece
It's totally creative piece
Some LOGICAL persons in South India thinks this is not a good film
But creative lovers can imagine this as marvellous"
" Unique, Brilliant and Mind blowing Masterpiece
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I am not from india but I understand hindi a bit. When I first time watched the (hindi dubbed version) movie in youtube, it made me thrilled. Such a brilliant direction with outstanding screenplay.
The story is unique and somehow it will touch your heart. Director deserves some accolade as the storytelling is captivating and organized. Since I study in a US university, I asked several south Indian lab mates about this movie. This is one of the best movie I have ever seen."
" AMAZING MASTER PEICE FROM SHANKAR AND VIKRAM

" JUST OUT OF COLLEGE OR HIGHER COURSE ""I PERISHED""
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,10,"This movie starring three leads male because we saw it at the THEATRES and not on demand and supply. VIKRAM also actor of several movies that IVE viewed during childhood years and adult-age. Like SAMI, KANDASAMI and ANIYAN because the cross cultural reference did not influence me. The furious adult state that misses joining an ashram for instance cannot be told to give up with coming clean of dope."

" Vikram's I !!!
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,7,"Yes !!!! It should certainly be called Vikram's I rather than Shankar's I. It is a film that deserves 7 out of 10 stars just because of the dedicated performance from a lead actor. Really, he has given everything to this role. He has given one of the most greatest performance one can ever see in any Indian Film. He has played four different characters in this film.
1. A bodybuilder.
2. A hunchback.
3. A supermodel.
4. A beast ( just for a song sequence ).
But, got to say he has nailed every role in the film.
S. Shankar has directed this film but got to say I, as a Shankar fan, was a little disappointed with his direction this time. This film is 3 hours 8 minutes long which shouldn't have been in the case of this film. The length of this film could have easily been cut out 15 to 20 minutes easily. 
All the other supporting actors and actresses including the lead actress Amy Jackson are just flat in the film. It must be because of the fact that Shankar didn't focused on their parts as much as he did on Vikram.
The music by A.R. Rahman is amazing as usual but in this film he has taken it on to the next level. The songs in the film are amazing (some of them shouldn't have been in this film). The background music is terrific as you can expect from A.R. Rahman. Infact it's the music of this film which manages to connect with the audience along with Vikram Sir's acting. 
P.C. Sreeram has done an outstanding job with the cinematography. He is certainly one of the best cinematographers we have and he has proved time and again. His camerawork especially in the China scenes is amazing and same goes for the songs. The songs have been shot in an interesting way.
The action of this film is really irritating to be honest and especially the China action scene is unbearable. The cage fight scene is good and the background music particularly in that scene is awesome.
Editing is not good in the fight scenes and also in the whole movie as it could have easily been 15 to 20 minutes short.
The VFX used in the film is good.
All in all ""I"" is a good one time watch entertainer.
Thank You."
" Good actors, but flawed story line
",2018-09-06 00:00:00,7,"Vikram movies come with a lot of expectation. Watching this day 1 theatres I was hoping for a superb thriller. For all the good work done by Vikram in acting, the script left me hoping for a lot more.The story of a local body builder turning to a super model and eventually being victim of jealousy. This leads to him losing out on his career and then it's his turn to take revenge. That's the crux of the story. Vikram has delivered lot of effort and looks amazing. Amy Jackson looks killer. The sets and sequences have been shot amazing well and has richness all across. As a movie coming from a Shankar the glamour part was intact, but the story line could have definitely better. Second half felt very predictable and dull."
" Innocent love that triumphs!
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,8,"Tone, Script & Story: The story is about a local man who wins Mr. Tamil Nadu climbs the ladder, gets into modeling; get to have his long time crush as girlfriend. All this goes away, he becomes ugly because of his enemies and finally the revenge.His love does not leave him in his bad time. The other thing that I liked is whatever ill happened to him were reversible.What Hollywood is to Bollywood, the same Bollywood is to Tollywood. The additional phrase entertainment, entertainment and entertainment makes such movie happening among local audience.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The movie comes to us from a celebrated director, 'S. Shankar' who also bought us Nayak (The Real Hero), Indian, Aparichit and Sivaji. It is good. Screenplay and cinematography are good too.Music: A. R. Rahman (music) + only 1 song in language I know = It is good. Acting: AverageFinal Verdict: Finally the soul of the movie lies in the statement 'Innocent love that triumphs!' It's an entertaining flick worth watching."
" i (2015)
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,10,The movie was excellent. Vikram's acting was main highlight in the movie. Visual Effects were amazing. The film was thrilling. Songs and BGM was amazing.
" A technical marvel
",2017-11-14 00:00:00,10,"Apart from the technical aspects which every Shankar's movie provides us with, this movie has a strong story- line with a blend of love and vengeance. The cinematography was superb and so was the cast and especially Vikram in this case. The total China episode was the biggest plus for the movie. The trailer was promising but a bit misleading. In my view, run-time could be the only problem."
" A different movie
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,9,"Ever since i saw the trailer,i was really looking forward to this movie and i had high expectations and i will say that i am very much impressed by this movie,especially that character of Vikram where he gets completely transformed due to the virus and the way he takes the revenge is completely a treat to watch"
