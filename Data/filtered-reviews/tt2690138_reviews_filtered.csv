" Superb tragicomedy!!!
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,10,"I was very close to overlook this movie because of the low rating, but then I read some reviews, and I realized there was something going on, some people liked it much, others felt disappointed. I understood that most people rating it as a bad movie was due to the fact that they expected a comedy, and most people rating it as good liked it because they understood the drama, tragic in the movie, which is the main theme.I think there are two problems here, first if you see a movie tagged as comedy and drama, what do you think it is? well, you should think is both, and you don't know which part plays a bigger role.Second issue is that IMDB movie genre tagging system is quite short, you can not tag a movie as a comedy that will show up in comedy list if it is no just or only a comedy.This movie is a TRAGICOMEDY, and that label does not even exist in IMDB, we have that genre since the ancient Greek times, it is certainly not the most common genre nowadays but it has always been there and we have it there in all cultural works, so it should be in IMDB. If not I should advise IMDB to tag this move only as a drama.I Loved this move because it is true and realistic, it tells you something that happens and has happened to millions of people though the ages, and that everyone address in different manners, some more intelligent and calm, some more stupid and catastrophic, but causes you an enormous pain."
" Stack em' like lawn chairs...
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,10,"This movie is hilarious. Forget the reviews. It's not the best movie ever but it's definitely worth watching, especially for the first time. I rated a 10 only to bring the average up. It is not a fail at all"
" Not funny
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,1,Sad sad sad. This movie was awful. I wasted a half an hour of my life. Guys don't even bother to watch it.
" One fo the 5-worst movies of my lifetime, no redeeming value at all!
",2019-07-11 00:00:00,1,"Wow - this was a stink-bomb. The studio said it cost $3,000,000 to make and brought in $540,000. The reviews are things like ""worst movie in Jack Black's list of bad movies"" and ""unfunny and unpleasant fails on all counts"" and ""disagreeable"" and ""The D TRAIN is as morose and ill-tempered as its protagonist but in the movie's case, the self-loathing is well-earned."" The marketing fail is the movie is advertised as a Jack Black teen comedy about a class reunion while doing a bait and switch to a NAMBA commercial that pushes all that is bad about that lifestyle choice. Unwatchable trash. This is the low-point of all these actor's careers. In fact, several of them don't even allow it to be listed on their IMDB list of movies and two have sued to have their names removed from the credits on the DVD! Run in the other direction!"
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,1,"I walked in and watched about 30 minutes of this after finishing another terrible movie (Maggie). I hate Jack black and had no intention of ever seeing this. it was actually pretty funny and interesting for a while, until i realized what it was about and walked out (1 viewing)"
" I can't in all good conscience say this is a particularly good movie, but you won't forget it.
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,5,"It is really hard to know quite what to make of this movie. I am inclined to think it's a hair away from being a masterpiece or just trash.I usually don't pay too much attention to which actors are or aren't in something, or rather usually I prefer to not recognize any actors, but the presence of Jack Black in here gives it a certain credibility, and his impeccable comic timing makes this that much more palatable.A very dark story about how much of our identity hinges on who were were as youths and how our lives go down hill from there. The plot demands that you believe that a class reunion could be that much of a big deal. It throws its own hands up at one point and tries to hand wave a plot hole by making it an oversight by the main character but it's still just a plot hole.Things take a very awkward turn half way through in a way I did not see coming. It's an intentionally discomforting movie where things can get quite excruciating. It's a tricky balancing act, not going over board with that kind of thing and overall this movie, despite its intelligent armoury of characterisation and nuance, doesn't quite pull its ambitious story off. Having said that I'm very glad this movie found its audience there were people who could get out of this movie the very particular thing it had to give.It rather smugly ends thinking it's resolved all it characters problems but it hasn't."
" Go into it with an open mind
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,10,"If you go into the movie for a silly Jack Black comedy, you may end up disappointed. If you go in thinking it's the deepest drama of the year, you may think it's shallow. But watch the movie and see where it takes you. You will laugh and you will feel something that holds some significance in regards to your own life and circumstances."
" Waste of Time
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,6,"Well, this movie totally sucks. The only good part about it is James Marsden, and also he is the only reason I gave this movie a six. It deserved one, to be honest but just for James Marsden's handsome face it got plus five from me. All I'm trying to say is don't watch it. It's just a waste of time but If you have plenty of it and you wanna see a handsome guy, then I'm sure you gonna like it."
" Terrible movie and a waste of talent
",2018-05-11 00:00:00,2,"A few great actors were roped into what can only be described as the WORST movie Jack Black has ever made.
Lacking a coherent plot, and failing with every laugh this movie is about as devoid of comedy as a holocaust documentary. 
I tried to like it and give it a chance, but it just got worse and worse as it went on.By the end I was sure they were using this film in Guantanamo to extract information from terrorists.
Just avoid."
" sad, pathetic character
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,4,"Dan Landsman (Jack Black) is a self-important sad man. He's married to Stacey (Kathryn Hahn) with teen son Zach. His boss is computer-adverse Bill Shurmur (Jeffrey Tambor). He has lived a limited life. He's the unliked lead organizer of his 20th year high school reunion. One night, he catches a TV commercial with popular former classmate Oliver Lawless (James Marsden). He insists that Oliver was a friend. He goes out to LA to invite Oliver to the reunion which culminates in a drunken sexual awakening.This is a dark comedy which left me cold. Dan is annoying, pathetic, and unfunny. His dilemma and his obsession is just as annoying, just as pathetic, and just as unfunny. This could have gone darker to go crazy with this premise but it doesn't. At the end of the day, I never cared about these characters and the movie doesn't make me care about them. It ends rather flatly. Sometimes, Jack Black takes on this other side of the coin. I wait for him to truly hit it out of the park with this persona."
" What in the world did I just watch?
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,2,Words escape me. The awkward/creepiness of the storyline has left be a bit unnerved....have fun!
" There is a Lawless inside all of us
",2018-01-15 00:00:00,3,"Daniel Landsman (Jack Black) Is attempting to get people to come to their 20 year high school reunion. He is obsessed and no one wants to come. He discovers former classmate Oliver Lawless (James Marsden) is a successful Banana Boat sunscreen spokes model. He convinces his boss (Jeffrey Tambor) to let him fly to LA under false pretences so he can convince Oliver to come to the reunion, using his name as a draw card.Daniel will do anything to get Oliver to come to the reunion, which made this an uncomfortable comedy. When I am not comfortable, I can't laugh, and the film wasn't funny up to that point to begin with. The whole film blows up at the end in an inane confrontation.Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity? Bad script."
" Horribleness Beyond Description
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,1,"Scenes in the trailer (and the poster image), where Jack Black's former high school loser parties down with James Marsden's popular cool guy at their class reunion, come and go in an 11th hour flash, and mean very little in one of the most falsely advertised motion pictures ever made...After a dry set-up involving Black seeking Marsden in Los Angeles, as his wife and son thinks he's on a business trip, leads to a shocking twist that's buried in the promotion for two reasons: It might take away from those yearning for Jack to regain the comedy crown from the Zach Galifianakis and Josh Gad types who stole his funny fat guy thunder years ago...And for anyone who actually paid to see a comedy, you might want to hold on to their money: The overall execution of what we do get from THE D TRAIN is awkward, slow- paced, and buries a vacant plot that suffers a bigger identity crisis than the dull and pointless main character.

" This is What Happens When The Snowflakes Take Over
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,1,"Wow! I mean WOW this movie was so heavy handed with it's agenda it nearly broken my head off of my shoulders. Yes, we get it, Hollywood hates family values almost as much as it hates the TRUMP administration, almost! Hey if you want to make a pro bisexual, pro early teen promiscuity stinker, that's your business Mr Hollywood director, but why disguise it as a happy go lucky family comedy?To Jack Black you beautiful, talented bastard, if Hollywood told you that it would be really cool to go chop off your unit and live life as a woman because, well heck all the kids are doing it, would you do it? I'll never look at your work the same now so....thanks for that.That's really all I can say about this piece of excrement. If you want to be grossed out while waiting desperately for something actually funny to show up that never really arrives, by all mans watch this film."
" A contemporary ""Marty""
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,8,"An unexpected surprise....in some ways the material was too good for Jack Black (he just doesn't possess the emotional nuance needed for a role like this)...but several of the cast were A+...the film deals with some very hefty themes with deft and wit....and can only be faulted for glibness at times, particularly the ending. Nonetheless, this is destined to become a classic in time....despite it's failings, it earns a place in the ""Marty"" pantheon of human dramas. PS; for those who can't do Jack Black, his performance here is actually pretty good."
" jack: please do something more serious
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,4,"3 and under are reserved for movies in which the acting is garbage. the acting in this movie is good.the movie is the problem.jack black has chops, but they're wasted in this movie. mr. marsden also sells it. the acting isn't what's wrong with this movie. what's wrong is: what? why did we, the audience, just watch this? it was everywhere, all over the place, and had no landing. it just sort of was.in a few weeks someone will be talking to me about the movie about that guy at the reunion where he got buttf*cked, and i'll say: ""Idunno man. Idunno what you're talking about."" Then he'll mention Jack Black, and I'll say, ""Oh, I think there was a Netflix thing that sucked where he was a salesman of some kind, and that dude from the transgender show who is really popular was his boss."" we'll both agree that that's the movie we both saw, then we'll go back to our desks.the end.that's where this ends."
" Don't bother if you want to laugh
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,3,"This is not a comedy. You'd think with the cast, you'd be laughing the whole way through, but I barely chuckled even once. The trailer makes it seem like it's a funny movie, but it's far more dramatic, and not even the good kind of drama. A little ways in, Black and Marsden end up having sex and it becomes all about how Black seems borderline in love with Marsden. The great actors in this chose a terrible plot with this one. Don't waste your time."
