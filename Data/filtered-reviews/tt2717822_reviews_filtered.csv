" Awful script and plot
",2021-04-11 00:00:00,2,"This movie could have been great. It could have been interesting. It could have been a lot more, and a lot shorter. But it wasn't.The scenes with the electrical impulses were completely unjustified. These don't add anything productive to the movie.Then, the chemistry between the actors was just not there. Most of the time it seemed as if they were just completely unrelated people just reading a script for a school theater play.Last, but definitely not least, what's up with the scenes where the hacker is basically invited to fight some terrorists? The guy is an expert in computers, not a trained professional that can fight crime lords. He even joins an operative without a gun, which somehow is justified by the death of the other guy, whose gun he takes.This movie is so unrealistic and boring. Definitely not recommended."
" If there's nothing else to watch...
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,4,What could have been an interesting cybercrime thriller instead was an underwhelming action movie. It's watchable but only barely so prefer other options.
" Flat as day-old soda
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,4,"I had never even heard of this film till it suddenly appeared on netflix. This is a typical Chinese vanity project type film, although I will give the film credit for being much more accurate with regards to hacking/tech than most movies. The problem is just the direction: it's hard to describe but everyone in the movie just feels off, characters have zero chemistry or charisma and combined with the at times bizzare script, hemsworth's
american? Accent, and a main love interest with terrible English who has wayy too many lines and you get a movie that feels like it was made by an AI rather than a human. There are also all these attempts at flashy camera work (inside circuts for example) that are excessively long and moving action shots that suddenly have much worse video quality than the rest of the movie. The action is pretty good at times, but it's hard to care about anyone when they all act like robots."
" Surprised
",2021-04-08 00:00:00,2,"Plot might be interesting, action scenes are ok but I'm quite disappointed with the quality of the production(scenes, camera angles, missing development, feels like someone chopped some scenes) and most of the mediocre acting; seems to be made by an inexperienced crew.I wrote the first paragraph during the movie, it really doesn't get better at all. Waste of time, so many weird scenes but the worse is; the two CIA with handguns only stopping in the middle of the road with no cover to eliminate mobsters(6 of them) with machine guns!!!???I don't understand how anyone is able give this movie a rating over 4-5...."
" Booooring
",2021-04-06 00:00:00,1,This movie is a masterpiece for whomever has insomnia. It helped me a lot.
" Not for me
",2021-04-06 00:00:00,4,"It is boring , full of tedious pauses and lack of synchronization between music and scenes. To be honest worst musics ever."
" implausible unlikely impossible
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,1,How is it possible to make such a bad scenario. Everything is just ridiculous and implausible.
" Right movie wrong actor
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,4,"No offense intended, yet I have to say that it was painful for me to watch this movie!Try to imagine watching Arnold Schwarzenegger doing ballet!Chris Hemsworth is ruining this movie, and I say that though I like the guy. He can be a great Thor but not impersonate a hacker. We all ""know"" that hackers do pushups all day, walk around semi-naked, and as soon as they meet a woman, she becomes dumb and entirely hypnotized by the seductive power that all hackers have.From a technical perspective, this movie belongs to the science fiction for kids genre, and I say that being an IT guy.I believe that choosing a different lead, a less muscular guy with an intelligent face, and removing just some of the clich√©s would've allowed this movie to have a chance."
" Michael Mann film
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,8,I knew about this film long ago but never realised it was directed by Michael Mann. Today only watched it. His another master collection for sure!!!
" Amazingly Bad
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,1,"This is my first movie review ever. I was so struck how bad this movie is that I made an account just to leave this review. I am blown away that grown up people have made this movie in seriousness, seems pretty high budget also."
" Complete waste of time!
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,1,"I stopped watching this rubbish after 45 minutes. Terrible script and terrible acting. Chris Hemsworth must cringe anytime this shocking film is ever mentioned. Complex, boring I can't think of one redeeming feature other than the beautiful lady in the film. Don't waste your time in this one it stinks to high heaven!"
" The hacking equivalent of erectile dysfunction
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,2,"Horrible watch, too long and a script so boring I started crying."
" Interesting but...
",2021-04-01 00:00:00,4,"It's a quite interesting movie, definitely worth watching, but:I didn't care about the main character's relationship so the drama around it felt boring.Action scenes didn't look as good as they could.A few things felt off storywise: Too much US-China cooperation and to little FBI-NSA cooperation. An inmate they are consulting with seems to be the lead investigator instead of being in an office exclusively using his expertise. At some point the bad guy tries to kill the only guy that can return him his money."
" Hidden Gem also another Mann Classic
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,9,"Underrated but brilliant film glad I found it in a 2021 lockdown. Simply brilliant, fast paced, clever an action packed multicontinental adventure well worth a watch. Unfairly low rating in here 8/10+"
" Not Mann's best but has a lot to offer 6/10
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,6,"""Blackhat"" is a good crime genre film by Michael Mann, for those who might be wondering, he is indeed the director of Heat (1995). Although this isn't his most notable work, neither his most famous one. Mann is a well achieved director and he manages to draw the best out of this film. Chris Hemsworth is a hacker forced to work with the American and Chinese governments in order to stop another ruthless hacker. The movie is filled with action and nice dialogue. My favorite part is when the car exploded, it definitely attaches to ""the bomb under the table"" act. All actors are great and Viola Davis always impresses me with her talent.The movie itself in terms of storytelling and plot doesn't have much to offer. In terms of cinematography, editing, vision and dialogue the movie does it's best and makes itself less dull. All in all, it was a good one by Mann."
" isnt the worst movie you see
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,3,"Isnt the worst movie you see, the story could have worked if its more refined. except hemsworth, the overall acting is stiff and the actions are loosely packed, somewhat feeling like a tv movie. and firstly theres no nuclear plant in hongkong, the closest is in daya bay, china, not to mention a meltdown and the city is not evacuated. second theres no extradition between hongkong n us, n certainly hk wouldnt extradite a hacker to us, if you remember the snowden case. also the dialogues especially in cantonese sounds like children arguing, exaggerating and pretentious. things like nsa officers opening a pdf as a keylogger, wrapping a bunch of magazines to stop bullets from rifles and automatics, bringing screwdrivers and knifes against heavily armed terrorists are just hilarious. the movie could have worked if it have done more research making it more convincing."
" Okay Flick. Worthwhile, Though In This Day And Age.
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,6,"Director Michael Mann's predilection for digital filmmaking is, to me, an acquired taste. Used to the analog look of real film stock, Blackhat, as well as Collateral, seemed more like ultra-sharp, ultra-crisp, ultra-colorful video, like a high action soap opera. As a techie myself, I appreciated the detail and relative accuracy of this cyber thriller. I think the technical jargon will leave a lot of folks in the dust, though. I have no complaints about the general acting, but were the proceedings realistic? I don't think so, but this is Hollywood - everything is always over the top. As a final note, I do hope that people take great care in protecting their online bank accounts by utilizing such things as password managers, multi-factor authentication, two-factor authentication, super complex passwords, and so on. In the movie, when Chris Hemsworth said it'd take him an hour to crack 512 bit encryption, that seems unlikely because the strings of code are way too long. Then again, with the speed at which modren technology moves these days, who knows?"
" That was just awful
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,1,"It all started with the ADR. They didn't even try to make the voices sound like they were in the scene's environment - everyone sounded like they were sitting in a sound booth. The editing was dreadful, with many of the same shots popping up over and over. The story was disjointed and the storytelling itself was nonexistent. I would complain about the acting, but I feel like that was more an issue with the directing since the cast usually performs well in other movies.Some of the other reviews say the bad reviews must be from people who didn't watch it to the end. I watched every minute of this atrocity. I expected some sort of Keyser Soze moment that explained why everything else was so bad and that moment didn't happen. Often Mann takes a hit for favoring style over substance. This movie had neither."
" Another Michael Mann Failure
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,1,"Not sure about the rest of you, but it's my opinion that with the exception of the movie ""Collateral"" with Tom Cruise, there isn't one movie Mr. Mann has directed that is any good. This movie, ""Blackhat"" is no exception. The jumpy camera work completely ruins the viewing of this movie. Now he didn't write this movie, so I can't blame him for the awful dialogue. But his direction during the dialogue scenes is horrible as well. There is no reason to discuss the waste of talent in this movie as the writing and directing just ruins whatever pleasure you might think you will get (and there's no pleasure). There is more to criticize, but instead I will leave you with 4 words; DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"
" Solid Hobest Movie
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,9,"It was a great film. They didn't dumb things down, it was realistic and didn't take the audience as a moronic simple mind. They portrayed a realistic course of events. A thinking mans film, and others have said it is just like reading a book, keeping you hooked as you go further on the journey."
" Fine if you want to waste 2 hours
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,5,"So badly written it was embarrassing. Chris Hemsworth and Viola Davis did their best but you can't make a silk purse out of a sows ear.
The acting of the other leads was wooden and painful to watch.
The 'love scenes' - I use the term loosely - were embarrassing but fortunately brief as there was no chemistry between Hemsworth and Wei was non existent.
Special effects were laughable. The Director tried but as I said earlier, silk purse and sows ears!
I gave 5 stars as it did make me watch it all the way through so I could find out how it ended, so that was a plus, however it was cringeworthy all the way through so don't waste your time ... unless you've got a lot to waste üòÅ"
" Slow burner, but worth the ride...
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,8,"Not your typical action/hacker/thriller.
Long periods without dialogue,like a silent movie with a moody score.
Lots of hand held camerawork added to the edginess of the movie.
Understated,well acted,allegorical and intelligent...probably not everyone's cup of tea, but I thought it was good."
" Really, a Michael Mann movie !?
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,1,"Cannot believe it is from the same Director who gave us ""The Insider"" and so many other epics.Really horrible casting to boot with and gets worst.The Hacker chosen by Mann - Hemsworth who is:
1. 6+ ft tall and voted most handsome in the world.
2. 6-pack abs with awesome bod
3. Awesome in bar fights, can take down multiple goons holding weapons using just his bare hands.
4. Expert in weaponary as well.
5. Can survive multiple gunshots and neck stabbing as well.
6. He is a surgeon too who knows how to treat above wounds.
7. So smart, he tricks a NSA engineer/analyst into downloading a PDF (which was a keylogger) for a Password Change. Cho smart.
8. Above all, he is the only hacker in the World who has written a RAT and can track down the bad dudes exploting his tool.Oh marry me @Chris Hemsworth and I am a Guy and totally straight :)Last but not the least to our Man @Mann - seriously dude, pls explain what were you thinking with that climax - how high were you to allow such a Non-sensical climax fight. 4-5 guys brandishing auto weapons walking in the middle of parade of 1000s of people for everyone to see, pushing, showing, shooting, getting shot, killed, stabbed and the crowd does not react till the very end, just keeps walking !?Really, would love to know your thought process as for me it went from bad to Rotten with that scene.Ps: i rate the movies i watch on a 4 point scale, 1 being Garbage. 5 being Watchable, 8 - Good, 10 - Awesome/Inspiring/near Flawless, cannot miss."
" Looking cool and acting dramatic...
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,1,"To start a movie with drawn-out doom for several minutes with no upshot is terrible. To introduce the main guy you follow through the movie as a hacker in jail with his back turned to the camera is dodgy, and when he's obviously just a pretty actor talking cool and dramatic is rediculous.Everyone else in the film is a nobody pretending to act dramatic with no upshot.No one is living for themselves. No self preservation. Just looking cool and acting dramatic..."
" Bigger actors and would have been blockbuster.
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,8,Surprisingly good. Occasionally over dramatic. Put Brad Pitt and Lucy Liu in the lead roles and it would have been a box office success.
" Such wasted potential
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,5,"To be honest, I mainly watched this movie for two reasons:1. Part of it is set in Jakarta and Indonesia where I spent a lot of time in my life and lived. I always feel it's a great city for movies and still not really used for that by Hollywood (might be a blessing).
2. Michael Mann. Heat is one of my favourite movies of all times.Why I think this movie has wasted its potential:This movie drew me in usually every time Chris wasn't on screen. The whole movie seems rather serious and straight-forward, but every time he is in those scenes, it seems to be kind of cheesy, like they try to turn the movie into a stereotypical hero vehicle for the main guy.This movie is mainly set in Asia. Why not cast an Asian guy? Or several? I mean, I know why, the movie is aimed at U.S. audiences, but oh, what a movie this could have been if they had used mainly Asian actors and shown the beautiful locations.If Mann is good at one thing, it's showing the beauty of cities (especially at night). Hongkong looks amazing, so does Jakarta (although you don't get to see much, mostly the area around Senayan is shown and some parts around Tanjung Priok).
The shoot-outs are quite good...until Chris steps in. Then the cheese factors is cranked up by 11.
Take the first one. It reminded me a bit of the famous shoot-out in Heat. The main henchman is retreating, setting a trap for the HK Special Ops team. He is calm, he knows what he's doing, so do his Indonesian henchman. But once a guy close to Chris gets shot, you feel like ""oh yeah, now Chris is gonna be a big hero"". Thankfully, at least they don't go full cheese then.Cut to the next shoot-out. First of all, it seems rather idiotic that the attackers keep shooting at Chris and the girl who clearly have no weapons, rather than to just walk towards them and kill them. What are they waiting for?
Well, apparently for Wilhelm Tell Jr. (the guy who looked a bit like Gerard Butler) who shows up only moments later with the black lady Chris called ""Chica"" early on. I mean, nevermind that a city like HK is apparently totally empty at night (I haven't been to HK, but if it's anything like Singapore, I'd expect dozens of people walking at the sidewalk), but why is there no car, no taxi, nothing? But ok...but does the guy have to be such a perfect shot?
The attackers are covered partially by a car. Yet the guy shoots like 4 of them with a single shot each while he's totally exposed until he finally gets shot, naturally giving Chris a chance to escape. That just doesn't seem like Michael Mann, sorry.Then we see that the electronic footlock Chris had to wear is put into a bag that some crook(?) that seems to work for an acquaintance of the Asian girl carries, presumably to mislead the marshal. I'd normally say maybe someone back in the States checks this too, but they hadn't realized until then that Chris had re-set the setting for the lock, so what's the point? Chris and the girl SAW that they are dead. Who's gonna check now?
Besides though, the signal clearly shows them LEAVING HK. So they took the bag with them on the plane? Oh well...Then they seem to stop over in Malaysia where big mining apparently never heard of security or fences and can just walk around and check on some turbines or pumps. Of course our ""hero"" quickly connects the dots...ehh...I mean...well, at this point, I didn't care so much anymore already...Finally, when they are in Jakarta, they can easily walk into the server farm place they found out about earlier. Now, if you've ever been to Indonesia, you'd know that there's always a ton of satpam (security guards). You wouldn't just walk in and especially not walk out, especially as a bule (foreigner)!
Similar thing happens at the bank. Let's say you can just simply hack into a bank after a receptionist foolishly inserted a USB drive to print out some papers...but Indonesian banking laws are some of the strictest I know! Yet Chris just transfers the money in like 2 seconds. So not even a PIN? No security question? Heck, my Indonesian account gets blocked if I didn't log in for a month and I've to go there in person. I highly doubt you could just transfer 74 mio dollars without as much as a pin or something...Finally, we get the (disappointing) showdown, presumably near Monas. There's some celebration that looks a bit like Nyepi and lots of men and women in traditional clothing smile happily as a few foreigners just keep pushing and punching them. Err, excuse me? I've seen Indonesian people. They stick together. They wouldn't just let some Lebanese guy push you to the floor without a wink! They'd be confused as hell why you're even walking into their procession.
Worse yet, as Chris approaches the henchman, it is sooo obvious that he's holding on to something (his shiv)! Now this henchman had training with a Lebanese paramilitary group and paramilitary groups in Columbia. Are you telling me he doesn't even see that? And then easily gets stabbed by some hacker guy? Where the hell did he even learn how to fight like Jason Bourne? In prison?
Also, the Lebanese (before he gets stabbed, which apparently, no one cares about) pulls a gun at him. People don't care. He gets stabbed. People smile and walk and don't care. Chris pulls a gun at the main bad guy. People don't care at all, even though he shoves some of them, so they CAN'T not see the gun!
Finally, when the two remaining henchmen start shooting, people seem to realize something is wrong. But come on, are you serious?
And after killing 4 people in front of 10,000 witnesses, Chris just walks away? No police, no nothing? Seriously, this is a joke! Like I said, there's private security everywhere in Jakarta. There are police posts everywhere. I just don't buy that some guys could have such a shoot-out and people don't care or call the police or anything. Plus, again, witnesses? Yet at the end, he and the girl seem to just fly away?Also, the girl...what the heck was the point of that forced love story? She meets this guy once and immediately opens her pan...heart for him? Are you serious?
And she doesn't mind being with him when it seems he actually has nothing and will be on the run? She is CHINESE! They are rational as hell! If he didn't look the way he looks (although I really don't get why women like him), why would she even go to bed with him?So yeah, I'm kind of upset.
The movie has a few good points that make me feel this could have been something:
cinematographysome parts are cleverKorean restaurant is in the exact same area where Al Pacino's character went to the night club in ""HEAT""decent shoot-outs (the first one at least)beautiful locationsBut it also has:
a miscast main character with the wrong ethnicity (this movie could have worked a lot better with some Asian hero)a totally unnecessary love story that feels just plain cheesythe urge to force Chris Hemsworth as a hero down your throatA disappointing ending with a pretty lame villain after all the build-upIt was an ok watch, but I don't know if I'd watch it again. If you want to see a good movie that takes place in Jakarta, better watch ""The Raid 2""."
" An international conspiracy seen from an international viewpoint
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,7,The movie plot takes a very boring subject matter (computer hacking) and turns it into a fairly fast moving drama on a true international level. The relocating from country to country can get confusing but then they really do film in all these countries. Each time I watch it I enjoy it more and more
" Underrated and Unknown
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,7,"Containing many of Mann autistic nuances, teams of people, use or architecture within he menes en scene and brilliantly realistic action I wouldn't class 5h3is as an unknown gem more an unpolished emerald. Thosewho know Mann's work well will appreciate it and looking at how it flopped those who don't didn't.
No Hemsworth's best work nor Mann's but even on his worst day Mann is better than most.Well worth a watch when looking for an action /thriller that doesn't dunb down the plot and keeps you intrigued throughout."
" Underrated! 5,4? Seriously?
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,8,"A movie like this should not just be above average. It's skillfully directed with its attention to detail plus consistent and memorable stylistics. Unlike many ""computer movies"", its plot and dialogue are very realistic, non-pretentious and free of annoying comic reliefs. The action sequences are also realistic, no showoff, no action for the sake of action. Also, I like that Hemsworth is ""allowed"" to remain masculine (direct, decisive and not controlled by his emotions) throughout the film. Not a common sight in our decade of movies where the male protagonists almost always get soft or confused at some point because of so-called ""progressivism"".I rate it an 8 because it's not perfect. I know Michael Mann is a very ""show, don't tell"" kind of director; that's what's so great about his movies. However, in this particular movie, some scenes could have had a bit more dialogue, a bit more explanation of the different phases in trying to catch the bad guys. Also, I think the antagonist is introduced too late in the movie.If you appreciate the stylistics of a film and not just its story; if you prefer realism over CGI or whatever, and if you like a straightforward no-nonsense type of film, Blackhat is that movie."
" Very Disappointing
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,3,"You would think a Michael Mann movie with Chris Hemsworth and Viola Davis would be at least watchable, but no.
While the computer elements were handled realistically, the movie suffers from a poor scriot and horrible direction.
The first half hour is mostly bad CGI of how computers work and fake news broadcasts about hacking events. Our star is on screen a whole 5 minutes at this point.
Bad editing and sound are a problem as well, not to mention a sex scene that seems to come out of nowhere.
I gave up trying to get through the rest of this movie. I can usually watch even the worst B grade movies all the way through, but this was just dull with no redeeming values."
" Better than a lot of the reviews
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,7,"A different crime/action/thriller for sure. Watched it because of Chris Hemsworth to be honest but it was actually pretty good. All the other actors were good, Viola Davis of course but others whose names I did not know. Yes maybe 10-15 minutes could have been edited out somewhere to shorten it for the impatient viewers but perhaps they should be more patient. Several different things happened to keep you wondering why the bad guy did what he did at the beginning, so it took a while to figure that out. If you were a computer geek you would probably like it even more as you would understand all the lingo re:hacking, but still good for us regular people. Not just a action/shoot em up type had some thinking parts as well. Overall a solid 7"
" Too much fat on this blackhat...
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,5,"Chris Hemsworth plays ""Jack"" a locked-up hacker who is given an opportunity for early release when some of his previously written code appears in software that has been used to attack a Chinese nuclear power plant. What follows is a world-wide hunt for the evil perpetrators of this highly sophisticated cyber-crime. As ever, Hemsworth is very easy to look at; and there is loads of gung-ho action as we narrow down the field. It's also got a reasonably plausible international cast - including Leehom Wang and Wei Tang - to give it some credibility, but the dialogue is really quite unscientific and pedestrian, given the complexities of the subject matter, and the ending seems to take at least half an hour of this overly long, repetitive, thriller to reach a very predictable conclusion."
" Bollocks
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,1,Slow with unexplained scenes. Would not recommend. Felt like I watched some stretched budget. Could have been much better.
" Mann Madness
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,4,"Starts off promisingly enough, then descends into farce. Excessive exposition, disposable characters, effortless illegal globe trotting & the weakest female lead I've seen in some time.
Watch Miami Vice instead."
" Possibly one the most generic movies ever. One doesn't even realise how generic until the credits. That's how generic it is. Not bad though.
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,5,"Very masculine, no nonsense story telling, that is constantly very serious but never over the top serious.It's difficult tot retain exactly what the plot is, there's nothing distasteful about it, it just does nothing to be particularly memorable."
" An important look into the world of cyber terrorism
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,9,"This is the most surprisingly accurate demonstration of how hacking works that I have ever seen in a movie...and apparently people were bored by it. Its sad to me that audiences are basically demanding hollywood dumb everything down for them. The same people that rated this low are the same people who struggled to understand ""Inception"". ""Primer"" would make their heads explode if they managed to pay attention. Anyway, if you've made it this far then go into this film with an open mind and you will learn the premise of the majority of hacks that you hear about in mainstream news. Its also well acted and directed."
" Great movie.
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,10,"This is a great movie. Low scorers didn't watch it through maybe. Yes, first hour a bit slow, but sure picks up second hour. Acting not award worthy I think, but still very good. Mastermind was a surprise."
" Good watch
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,7,"Dont listen to what the other guy on here said, some people watch films some people study them, its a good film if nothing else is in, give it a go"
" Chris Hemsworth mumbled his way through this snooze fest
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,1,Although I love Viola Davis as the sassy special agent I could barely understand what hemsworth was saying. Very poor diction for an actor. I personally don't think it warranted a 2h12m runtime. It didn't grasp me. Maybe it's cos I couldn't make out what Hemsworth was saying. Blow yr nose and SPEAK UP.
" 2hrs and 15 minutes of my life I'll never get back
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,3,"There's absolutely no reason for this film to be over two hours long! I actually at one point thought to myself, nearly there only go find there was still an hour to go!
I also find the low standard of shooting at the main character ridiculous. From their fire and manoeuvre, clearly trained professionals. They managed a nice neat three round grouping centre of mass at an expendable character yet continually miss the lead character despite him being closer and not moving. Rounds clearly penetrating their choice of hard cover (in fairness actually quite accurate) yet it doesn't seem to dawn on any of them to just drop their aim a couple of millimetres for a kill shot! The same ammunition I may add that's miraculously deflected by half a magazine.
A felon who's now very much wanted, decides not to wear gloves at any point and leaves more fingerprints at more locations than, well pretty much anything ever in the history of forensics...........
If Chris Hemsworth could take a break from looking off into the distance in a thoughtful yet brooding manner once and awhile, they could shave 40 minutes off this film. Of course, he possibly was being paid by the hour.
Are you seriously trying to tell me the only other people using the water pump they intend to hack is a nuclear power plant, and the most discrete way to do a test run is to cause a nuclear incident?!
Film making is an art, I get that. I appreciate the effort people make and we get to enjoy the results of their labour and effort. This however is just an abomination!
Do yourself a favour, if you've actually got the two hours to waste. Find a large wall in your home, paint it a nice magnolia. Then sit there for two hours on the floor watching it dry. It'll be much more enjoyable, a better use of your time and less painful in the long run.
No! Just no!!!"
" Boring and confusing
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,2,"Blackhat is an action techno-thriller movie starring Chris Hemsworth, Tang Wei, Wang Leehom, Viola Davis and Holt McCallany. The movie is directed by Michael Mann.The movie is boring to the core and disappointing. The movie never came near to be called as thriller and Chris Hemsworth is purely wasted in the movie.The climax of the movie is also disappointing and the viewers will almost give up after watching the master plan of the hacker. Acting by support cast is ok.Overall a boring thriller movie without any thrill."
" B O R I N G
",2019-08-09 00:00:00,1,"I work in IT Security, I love technology, and movies about computers, hacking, etc... this film bored me.Too much drama/conversation throughout the movie, not enough action. Chris Hemsworth did not suit the part of a computer hacker, nor did he suit the role of this character.I'm bamboozled that people gave this movie a higher rating that 2 stars for this movie. It was uninteresting, boring, and rubbish.If you want to watch a film about people engaging in dialogue throughout, then this is for you... If you want a movie about technology and hacking, then skip this movie."
" Mann's worst film by far
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,3,"As a lifelong fan of Michael Mann, this film was a huge disappointment to me. After all, this is the guy who gave us such classics as Miami Vice, Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans and Heat. Most of all, Blackhat's plot is horribly ludicrous and unbeliavable. Secondly, Chris Hemsworth is utterly miscast as the master hacker. Hemsworth can't act to save his life, plus physically he is a stereotypical jock, not a hacker."
" Chris Hemsworth suspiciously looking around for 2 hours.
",2019-06-11 00:00:00,2,"Although there is action, sadly most of the movie is full of awkward scenes, dialogues, and the story is quite basic."
" DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!!!
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,1,"This has to be one of the stupidest movies I've ever seen sorry! I don't waste your time on this one!!!
I.E., CHINESE SECRET AGENTS TALK PERFECT ENGLISH AND WITH AN AMERICAN ACCENT!!
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO WASTE MY TIME DISCUSSING IS STUPID MOVIE ANYMORE! WHAT ARE YOU TAKING OFF WORK 45"
" So bad... omg
",2019-04-05 00:00:00,2,"This is so bad that I had to leave a review!
The camera work is not good, the story is dated and been done and been done in way better ways. Everything is just kinda half-axxed and the actors/actresses who are actually not all bad normally just came actossed fake and cheesy in this movie! Sigh~ I guess the only good thing which is sad to say are the eye candys and that's really about it! Not a good (enough) reason to go to a movie or even sit on the couch for couple hours for."
" Broken Code
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,4,"Blackhat is a tedious and a poorly plotted thriller from the normally reliable Michael Mann.The Chinese crime investigation agency join forces with the FBI when a a Chinese nuclear plant is hacked and then later the Chicago Mercantile Trade Exchange.The Chinese send Chen Dawai and his sister Chen Lien to join the FBI led by Carol Barrett (Viola Davis) to find who is the hacker.Dawai wants his old roommate from MIT who wrote an important piece of code. Nick Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth) who is now in prison.Hathaway is released and joins the team. As they investigate the team is whittled down in shootouts. Hathaway realises that this cybercime is an elaborate plan to make money.This is a globe trotting cyberthriller. It has some muscular neon lit shootouts but it also wastes its characters and actors such as Viola Davis and John Ortiz in a baffling shootout sequence.When it goes to its finale set in Indoenesia, you have people finding each other in vast crowds and no one in the crowd seems to run when there are people shooting.The movie is an implausible mess."
" Not that bad!
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,6,"Blackhat is not as bad as they say! It's not the finest film from Michael Mann but it's not his worst either. It has good action scenes and some very interesting characters. I wish there were more scenes with the US marshal, he's one of badass MF'er!"
" I just love it!
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,8,I love this movie. I am no computer expert and I must admit that I do not really understand the parts about all those hacking but the movie is fun and Tang Wei is truly wonderful!
" Trying to mix multiple types
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,4,"Trying to mix multiple types together will naturally turn ugly. The plot is sparse, logic is inconsistent, the rhythm is protracted, all are wooden faces."
" International thriller
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,8,"I'm with the ""8""s. A good solid thriller. Complicated and engaging plot. Characters with complicated back stories. Plenty of action and unusual settings."
" YOU DON'T KNOW ME. BUT I KNOW YOU.
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,7,"The film opens with a Chinese nuclear power plant losing its cooling pumps due to a cyber attack. The Soy futures market goes bonkers and everyone in Hathaway's cell block has an extra $900 in their account. Coincidence? The US and China team up to find the hacker. Chen Dawai (Leehom Wang) is tasked with finding the culprit who used a RAT (remote access tool). Oh this wasn't just any RAT, but one that he and Hathaway created together while goofing around in college. So Chen makes a case that he needs Hathaway to solve the case and for someone to keep his sister (Wei Tang) company so we can extend the film to 2 hours and possibly attract a female audience with a bad guy love story.Now the hacker isn't some fat guy behind a keyboard eating junk food, fishing out crumbs from his belly button as you would expect, but a bad guy with middle men who possess automatic cannons. Our guys travel with the NSA gal (Viola Davis- Hollywood obligatory African-American) to places like Hong Kong and Jakarta, of which we see the the back streets.I liked how the film started out, but once we got into the middle part, it slowed down even with the gun play. In spite of going over 2 hours, I thought the character development was a bit on the weak side and seemed to have come from one conversation in the air. I could only half get into the film.Guide:1 F-bomb near the end. Implied sex. No nudity."
" A Different Cyber Thriller That Doesn't Make It
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,6,"6 September 2015. Chris Hemsworth stars in this computer espionage thriller. Michael Mann's imprint as a director diverges somewhat from his intense, sharp, and action themed thriller. Instead Mann seems to be experimenting with a softer cinematographic inclusion of emotional undertones than most of his movies. Mann still has more work to do on refining his portrayal of relationships. In addition, several actions scenes, especially the ending could use more work as well. The cerebral focus of this thriller is commendable especially in contrast to Len Wiseman's Live Free or Die Hard, but unlike a suspense movie like The Russia House (1990) or even Jumping Jack Flash (1986), Mann is unable to suspense the consistent undercurrent throughout the movie. Other hacker movies to consider are Antitrust (1981) and Swordfish (2001)."
" It's a total mess
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,5,"There are good scenes, gunfights, action, romance, and thrill but overall it was awfully slow and that made it quite boring. The story could not be put together properly and it messes up the movie"
" ""...I'm not sure there's any light at the end of this tunnel anymore.""
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,7,"I don't know what viewers expect in an espionage crime thriller, as the rating for this picture is rather low at 5.4 as I write this. I didn't think it was that bad if you can set aside the impossibility of Nick Hathaway (Chris Hemsworth) making all the correct keystrokes every time without a hitch, or how he and Chen Lien (Wei Tang) could navigate this global adventure while on the run, with no luggage, and always having a change of clothes. But with the benefit of computer hacking and transferring seventy four million dollars into a Swiss bank account, I guess money wouldn't have been a problem. I was taken aback by how many of the good guys got wasted in the story, especially Carol Barrett (Viola Davis), who I didn't think would be left facing the sky after getting shot by the villain gang. What gets me is the greed shown by a thug like Sadak (Yorick van Wageningen) right after he corners the soybean market for the seventy four mil in the first place. Gee, how much money does a person need? He had to create a tin shortage on the world market by flooding five Malaysian river valleys to become a billionaire. Seems like a lot of trouble to go through for all that loot. And when all was said and done, I'm not so sure Hathaway and Lien made the quick getaway they expected. After all, they were monitored on all those huge computer screens after foiling Sadak's master plan. But as I always say, even if the story defies credibility, they can be fun to watch."
" hacker vs hacker to stop cybercrime
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,3,Review: I really struggled with this movie because I am not tech-savy enough to totally understand the concepts brought up within the movie. The direction and screenplay aren't bad. The casting and acting are both really good. All in all I would give this three out of a possible five stars.
" just great! may even be as good as Miami vice! another masterwork from m mann.
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,10,Chris Hemsworth rocks as a so to say vigilante computer hacker.interesting portraying of the prison and its inmates. may even be realistic. I don't know.sad that it only earned 3 stars in average!
" Disappointed
",2018-09-06 00:00:00,5,"I was expecting a lot more.
The style of Michael Mann is there, photography, score, pace, but the plot is too confusing, and the characters not developed enough."
" Blandhat.
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,4,"Blackhat is so bland, and blends boredom with abandoned potential. There is just so much that is flawed with this film, that it's hardly worth it to go into it. The Malware plot is fine, it's neither here nor there, it's the execution of everything else that is just damn near terrible.When Hathaway and team go into the Nuclear Power Plant, a scene that could've delivered so much intensity and action, fell so flat, you could balance a pin on it. Seriously, it's inconceivable really, to have thrown that opportunity away.During their plan in Jakarta, Chen has on this fierce game face on, that has the viewer just wondering with some enthusiastic curiosity; ""What is their plan""?, just for it to be a extremely simple 1 minute shot with zero fulfillment.The end sequence is so nonsensical. It goes beyond the suspension of disbelief too radically, especially given how INCREDIBLY realistic this movie was clearly attempting to be.Hemsworth's American accent is poor, in fact, Hemsworth just can't pull that accent off period. He is mumbling, and that together with his deep voice, makes it a nightmare to make out what he is trying to say.There is more that's wrong with this movie. Given the story delivered, the Cyber Crime Thriller tone of this film could've easily been replaced by any other plot, and Blackhat wouldn't be any better or worse for it. In other words, even if you knew absolutely nothing about Cyber Information Warefare and Cyber Cryptic Terrorism, and so on, or whether you knew everything about it, it wouldn't make this movie any better or worse, because the story just doesn't explore its plot, it merely just uses it a vehicle to be a typical thriller movie, and still, there is more that is wrong with this film. 4/10."
" A thinking man's action thriller!
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,9,"BLACKHAT isn't the film for you if you're unwilling to use your brains while watching a film.This film is indeed a thinking man's action thriller. Of course, there are plenty of action sequences, mind-bending twists and some character drama in this film tackling cyber crime.Director Michael Mann has chosen serious path of execution for a film which could've been a fun entertainer. It's no simple fun but serious fun instead. 
Chris Hemsworth shines throughout the film. This isn't really a complex role for him to play but has performed quite well, especially in the solid fight sequences. 
Almost the same for the rest of the cast. Technically, this film is impressive. The cinematography in certain sequences is splendid. Action scenes are quite realistic and energetic. From fistfights to gunfights to explosions: BLACKHAT delivers a lot to satisfy any action fan. The presentation of the opening sequence with detailed amount of visual effects is absolutely mind-blowing.The editing definitely could've been better as the film seemed to slow down at various crucial junctures. Still, BLACKHAT is a seriously entertaining action thriller which is definitely worth your time, viewing, and collection."
" Weird scenes
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,2,"I watched this movie and couldn't enjoy it. It lasted very long and some scenes didn't make sense. For example this that bothered me were the dialogue in the restaurant between Hathaway and Lien, the cop killing at least 3 guys with assault rifles without taking cover, the 'you are dead over 40¬∞C' moment and the temperature keeps climbing, the end where he can stop a bullet with magazines and a knife with his scarf, he kills someone with a screwdriver (why no knife) in a crowded area no-one seems to care until they start shooting."
" Unexpectedly,this is a film of hackers of hand-to-hand battles.
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,5,"This story setting is interesting but I wonder whether it was taken full advantage. Though I was excited in action scenes.
By the way,why do Asian brother and sister get a long with? I admire the relationship like them very much."
" 8 stars for Chris Hemsworth.
",2018-07-18 00:00:00,8,"Took away 2 stars for the movie filming, directing, looonnnggg/repetitive story line, horrible fight sences, and boringness. Added 8 stars for Chris Hemsworth eye candy and acting. This movie is a solid 3-4 when you are bored. He brought it WAY up."
" Solid international thriller
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,8,"Michael Mann's BLACKHAT is a hacking-based international thriller starring Marvel main man Chris Hemsworth as an imprisoned computer hacker released from jail to track down an international hacking terrorist with plans for something big. He teams up with characters from the Chinese mainland to bring the villain to book, and the story goes from there. I found this a surprisingly enjoyable little film which mixes the usual computer hacking tropes and effects with a BOURNE-style action plot and at least three decent action scenes. Mann shows that his flair for a violent shoot-out hasn't abandoned him since his HEAT days and the subsequent action is as brutal and exciting as you could want. Hemsworth gives a relaxed performance away from his best-known Thor role and the Chinese actors added to the mix can be relied upon to deliver decent performances. The film is a little long and feels slow at times, particularly with the cliched romantic sub-plot, but it delivers the good and offers thrills a little more cerebral than some."
" Computer geek turned instant action hero
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,2,"So this hacker is in pris for... well, hacking and is promptly released on licence as he's the only one who can possibly solve whatever this crisis is. Almost instantly he turns into an action hero secret agent type who's proficient with weaponry - and that's it in a nutshell."
" Suspense, Romance, International Intrigue, Fast Typing: So Why So Boring?
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,1,"So Michael Mann spent $70,000,000 on this incoherent mess, and it's 2:13 minutes of a straight-to-DVD mess. I think in the movie business they call that 20 pounds of manure in a 10 pound bag. There are lots of beautiful shots of China and Malaysia-too bad he wasn't making a National Geographic special.First of all, the romance was so clich√© and forced. Sex scenes in movies are so 1980. There is rarely anything even approaching chemistry so why bother? If you want to make a romance, then make a romance, but don't make an action thriller with a romance because it won't be either. The woman has zero likability in my opinion, zero screen presence.Now let's just have a completely random and unnecessary fight scene because we haven't had any action in two minutes. No fight can make up for the tedium of watching someone typing on a keyboard.It just gets worse and worse, dragging on with shots of the girl walking (then sitting and pouting), everyone converging on one location (he can hack into an NSA computer but he can't remove an ankle bracelet?), and then we screech to a halt for a lovers' quarrel. ...then we're back with a sorta stupid shootout but I had stopped caring a long time ago."
" Rare attempt at technical accuracy
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,8,This movie is shot artistically to unfold a story that is not a usual cliche action movie plot. Real command lines are also a balm for a viewer's eye as opposed to the usual gibberish and pretty looking 3D interfaces.
" Perfect execution!
",2018-04-19 00:00:00,7,"When i saw this movie for the first time i didn't understand it... the movie seemed surprisingly realistic at times especialy the shooting scenes and other times as it is said in the movie at some point ""overwritten""
Well now after few yeas i see it as a masterpiece! there is no way Michael Mann can slip... you may think so because he really wants to keep his idiocracies which is part of the artistic expression.
Everithing in this movie is well calibrated, the lightning, camera angles, he communicates trough every color and sound, i can see Mann's spirit in every scene :) which is a sign of a true story teller! and Hemsworth did a fantastic job expressing Mann's point of view."
" A horrible film even Chris Harmsworth was in it.
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,1,"No offense but the movie is so terrible. I really had a high hope for this one because Chris Harmsworth was in it. I thought yeah, it'd be a great movie because he's in it. But it's just another big disappointment. I tried to be patient and kept watching to the nearly ending. When it came to last 30 mins, I couldn't keep watching to the end. Maybe I'm so stupid, so, I didn't get the meaning. I was blindly watching for the whole time. When I stopped watching, I was glad that I stopped. Watching this film was just waste of time and money. Thus, yes, it makes one of the movies that I couldn't finished because it's too boring."
" More like crap in a hat!
",2017-12-14 00:00:00,2,"Black Hat one can write that Chris Hemsworth took the money and ran very fast with this one! What did not work: Too much did not work here: All the characters played the tough alpha male role. In today's cutler everything in movies has to be the same which makes for horrible character development. There is no balance between characters and or levity. Usually married couple, best friends etc balance each other out, with one being introverted the other extroverted etc! Bad movie characters like in Black Hat have no development. Blackhat's bad movie characters create disjointed scenes which creates one awful movies. Too make matters worse add Blackhat's plot holes, and story gaps your watching a big time awful movie. How does one meet a computer at a Korean restaurant? No idea with the story line here. Suddenly these bad guys show up for no reasons for an action sequence. I just became totally lost with the film. Confusion is how I felt watching this disjointed and confusingly awkward story. Fell asleep for the second half movie. Avoid this dog of a movie. 2 stars out of 10."
" The Deep State
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,10,"I'am not always able to determine just how much of an interest is generated when a motion picture tells the story of Black Hat computing.There does not seem to be an end in just how deep the deep state will go but this film possesses that ability to delve into the deep state and its Black Hat ideology. It, that is this film offers the would-be viewer a glimpse into a very dangerous and deadly world of not only computer hacking but into would be disasters.This is a very serious and deadly contest where good ultimately triumphs over evil.This film is that dramatic and in a manner of speaking it is that well told.The Director Michael Mann did very well as the film was guided by very expert advisors in creating this virtual world that ""Black Hat"" exists in, as both computer information can be very spot on and violence arrives with the suddenness of true guerrilla quality engagements.There are high profile security agencies involved in one attempt after another to track down and ultimately identify the culprits of a nuclear disaster.I have to give the Director Michael Mann some credit here as well as the performances enhanced this often difficult territory.Michael Mann did more than just Direct he knew what he wanted and it is this opinion that this is a very well performed motion picture.Nick Hathaway played by Chris Hemsworth, Carol Barrets played by Viola Davis, Mark Jessop played by Holt McCallany, Leehom Wang played by Chen Dawai, Elias Kassar portrayed by Richie Coaster and Tang Wei portrayed Leehom Wang's sister.The story is such that compelling viewing is required.The stability of worldwide financial markets and even the very earth is threatened by this terribly dangerous place that the untrustworthy inhabit, indeed we are the curators and this world is our responsibility.The violation of a nuclear reactor in China caused a near meltdown with a bad actor having been hired at a point with access to the very most secure and most sensitive areas of the Reactor.The fault is very hard to fathom because this particular discovery is that this particular individual was in the F.B.I. databases of known Felons.This guy has a record and somehow he had access to one of the most secure networks we know of, a nuclear reactor.It is learned that this violation enabled the principal ""Bad Guy"" to install a backdoor into a computer switch and once launched drove the Centrifuge to fail which in turn removed any ability to cool the Nuclear Rods. Watch this because this is compelling viewing, it might even get more interesting when watching the run-up of the Futures Markets as what I believe is an actual Botnet used to employ a concentrated buying and selling scheme whereby this particular ""Bad Guy"" made some 74 million dollars.This is what I meant when I suggested of a threat by the ""Deep State"".These attacks are worth knowing about and so is ""Black Hat"". The term ""Deep State"" is not in a traditional sense to be associated with say The United States or perhaps the country of China, the ""Deep State"" is mostly used as a descriptive text of a darkened world protected by those whose interests it protects, namely ""Hackers"", ""Blackhats"", and those whose ability such protection would best be served. The Dark Web is another associative text whereby everything is sold or exchanged for other things that can be sold for or exchanged. This includes any illicit credit card numbers, social security numbers, classified information and so on. The Dark Web, like The Deep State"", serves and protects the interests of a Black Hat Community. There is much in ""Black Hat"" to write about and perhaps much more as it would concern the Computer. To be certain ""Black Hat"" has proved to be very interesting both as a Motion Picture and Computer acumen."
" It's Black All Right....
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,4,"Blackhat is full of highly improbable and patently implausible scenarios that add up to the ultimate shortcoming of the movie. The antagonist begins by blowing a nuclear reactor and then manipulating the soy market, after which the Feds zero in right away on the scheme and those who benefited. Yet, in his grand scheme, the antagonist expects to corner the tin market without consequence?!?! C'mon...And did I mention tin? TIN?!?! Of all the commodities in the world, this bad guy goes after a low margin staple produced in a country (Malaysia) that isn't even in the top six countries producing tin! Then there's the protagonist, who we're expected to believe can hack into the NSA computers. C'mon...The acting is incongruous and the sound editing was terrible. When dealing with Asian actors, this latter issue becomes ever more important, as they tend to have a softer timbre. The lack of attention to sound had many of the participants mumbling, or the dialogue fading in and out.But the real ""nail in the coffin"" was seeing Michael Mann's name attached to this mess. Is this the same man who directed Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans, Heat and Thief? I expected a much better film coming from an MM production. Still, there's several action sequences that move the flick along, for which I give it four stars."
" Wrong cast for this sleeper film
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,6,"Although I didn't have high expectations going into this film, it still managed to be so disappointing, slow and boring, I couldn't even finish the film to the end. I really didn't care what happened. Some of the main problems for this film is the slow boring pace, the lack of real action, and the absolute wrong casting for this film. Sorry, but Chris Hemsworth is not convincing one bit as a hacker. It's a very generous 6/10 from me."
" Slow burner worth the watch
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,8,"OK.This is not a quick moving film. And you have to be careful to follow and pay attention because the director moves quickly and at a high level.The writing is clean, the editing always serves the very tight feeling the Director is crafting.The best things about this film revolve around the actors. Viola is fun to watch, and the Chinese (?) Cast bring a certain unpredictability to the film.The main character arch is the problem. We don't know him, we get no background - he's unbelievable, and though Chris tries his best, they really should have moved him as far away from being recognisable as possible. Here he's half Thor/half Jason Bourne and unsuccessful as either.The film however, holds its own. It is authentic, it is terse without being loud and it's well made.Pour a Brandy turn down the lights and quiet down. It will reward you with a slow burning, satisfying feeling. It's never riveting but always solid. Like a good Brandy."
" Could've been much better
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,5,"I have mixed feelings about this. It's not particularly well written and on the Netflix version I watched I had to adjust volume a few times. I remember having to do that with an early Mann film, The Keep, so I wonder if it is something he does as a director. If so, it's annoying.The story has real potential but the skills given to the main character just seem too far fetched, particularly his fighting skills.I like the idea of China and the USA having to pool knowledge and resources but that part is not examined enough and the film is just a vehicle for the lead actor to flash his biceps and deliver poorly written dialogue in a stilted way. His co stars do their best but the Director makes it all about a frankly unbelievable main character."
" robk-952-110475 -- thanks for review
",2017-05-22 00:00:00,9,"Thanks to robk-952-110475 for his very thoughtful review and details.It is great to have the scoop from someone who knows the scoop. I thought it was a really good movie, but I will be interested in watching it after reading your review. I will keep an eye on those details. Appreciate the effort to inform others."
" Mind-bogglingly boring
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,3,"When I was watching Blackhat, three separate times I questioned whether sitting through until the end was going to kill brain cells. I asked my brother, who thought the movie was okay, to name one personality trait of the main character. After a long pause, he said only ""stoic"". That's this movie's biggest problem. There is nothing to endear you to any of the characters. They have faces and job titles, but no stories. There is one part of the movie where two characters sit down and have a real conversation about their personal lives and motivations, but it's the part that makes the least sense. They speak in riddles and clich√©s. Because the characters are so poorly developed, there's no way to forgive the far-fetched plot. The long, artistic shots that would be the film's best quality are part of what makes it so boring. There's no symbolism or meaning in the visual, it's just supposed to look pretty or something, but at best it made me think ""Well, I guess that shot was aesthetically pleasing"". I wasn't quite sure. If just you're looking for a fun action movie, this isn't the one. The three or so decent action sequences are nice, but short by contrast to the long, meaningless pretty scenes in between. Even the special effects in this movie are confusing. The ""hacking"" involved isn't too terrible, they actually refer to long periods of time needed to accomplish things, but you also get weird visual effects of the inner workings of computers, beams of light traveling on tracks. It serves no purpose. It doesn't look good. It's just computer-y. I somehow sat through the whole thing, but I would never recommend this movie to anybody."
" confusing
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,6,"Looking at this film without any knowledge of anyone in it or the director (Michael Mann), I would have told you the following: It's low budget; and it is targeted to 15-year-old boys in Thailand, which is the typical blockbuster audience.And I'd be wrong. Low-budget? How is $70 million? And how much did it make worldwide? $19 million. You spell that f-l-o-p.""Blackhat"" stars Chris Hemsworth as Nick Hathaway, a prisoner for stealing money from banks using his vast computing/hacking expertise. After a cyber attack at a Chinese nuclear facility and to the American commodities market, the U.S. and Chinese governments join together to find the ""blackhat"" responsible. On the Chinese side is Colonel Chen Dawai (Leehom Wang), who, accompanied by his sister Chen Lien (Wei Tang), joins Carol Barrett (Viola Davis) and Mark Jessup (Holt McCallany) in LA. Looking at the data, Chen Dawai realizes that the computer code used was actually invented by a friend from MIT -- Nick Hathaway. Chen Dawai wants him for the team.The U.S. government tells Nick he will be going on furlough, but he wants his sentence commuted if he can identify the hacker. That is agreed to, and the team leaves for China. Identifying the hacker is one thing - but finding out the motive is another. Such terrible cinematography - it looks cheap and gritty. The story is too talky, and I think Hemsworth was miscast. What was needed was someone who comes off as intelligent. I'm not saying Hemsworth isn't intelligent, but his acting persona is that of a tough guy. This guy is supposed to be a brilliant hacker from MIT. Not buying it.The story was also on the confusing side.Filmed in Hong Kong, Jakarta, Malaysia, and LA, the languages used throughout the film include English, Cantonese, Korean, and Indonesian - which was another reason I thought this was geared to the foreign market.This is a Michael Mann miss, though there are some exciting action sequences and major shootouts. The acting from Davis, Callany, Leehom Wang, and Wei Tang was very good. For all her amazing talent, Davis didn't have much to do.It's an okay rental - I wouldn't have wanted to pay to see this in the theater."
" Bad directing and bad writing, worse I have ever seen
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,1,"Movie too slow, I thing more concentration on the love or connection between Hathaway(Chris Hemsworth) & Chen Lien(Wei Tang).Alert a spoilerThe surprise factor is killing of all the supporting actors and actress in a movie is never heard for. Killing of Chen Dawai(Leehom Wang) the lead detective, Carol Barrett(Viola Davis) the lead between USA & China and Mark Jessup(Holt McCallany) the bodyguard to Hathaway. At least you could have shown them brutally injured or hospitalized but no you killed them all. Even the police office who was assigned to them for helping( who died after getting shot in the shoulder)Also surprisingly a computer nerd killing all the bad guys single handily. It looked as if instead of a hacker he was a trained assassin, in close range as well as with a gun. When does a Magazine warped around your body works like a bullet proof vest. In a earlier firing scene (in Honk Kong where they fight with cops) people were getting killed even after having bullet proof vest. The Police officer who was helping the team, dies after getting hit in the shoulder. Who dies after getting shot in the shoulder and also in seconds. But no Hathaway is being shot many times but in the end scene he just gets some gets some scratches not even a wound that need no stitches with no blood loss.Who would want to draw attention to themselves by blowing up a reactor just a for test run for the water pumps. Of course the army, anti terrorist and USA would be after them."
" Good plot & acting, bad directing
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,6,"The plot was good and interesting, the actors been well cast and performed good. The directing was for the first part of the movie good but got clumsy in the end. The only action scene that was good, was the brawl in the restaurant, all others been dreadful, unrealistic and brain dead."
" Interesting and Enjoyable
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,10,"I really love this movie and don't understand why it got so many negative reviews.Every character is interesting; every performance is spot-on. Every time I watch the film I get more out of it. It's multi-layered. I don't know if every bit of hacker-type info is correct because I know very little about computer code and high-tech computer lingo, but the story is believable.One of the main characters, Nick Hathaway, is a really nice guy; kind, loyal and laid-back. OK, so he's a hacker and he committed cyber crimes; but he's not a Bad Guy; not like the really bad guys that care nothing for human lives.I really hope they make a sequel."
