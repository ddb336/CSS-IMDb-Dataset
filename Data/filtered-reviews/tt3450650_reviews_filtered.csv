" Wtf
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,5,This movie is not good and little bit bad omg I feel stupid watching this movie the first part is good but this part is little bit bad.
" Paycheck day
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,2,"Happy Madison Productions is almost always guaranteed to return on investment. Whatever Adam Sandler and co. are doing, they have the mass market formula downpat. Even for more bottom of the barrel cinematic affairs, this doesn't provide much. It leaves you checking the time and asking ""how much longer."" Don't spend any time trying to piece together the plot. The Vegas setting is cool, too bad it takes little advantage of it. Among other cons, bad guys with no distinct personalities and a Kevin James' character that is more detestable than lovable. Maybe cream of the crop in spiteful Christmas gifts and dollar theaters, but loathed everywhere else."
" Til Death Do Us Blart (ðŸ–¥, ðŸ˜Ž)
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,2,"This movie is my cross to bear, my dark sacrement, the Sword of Damocles that hangs over me ever year. After over seven viewings of this movie it has become like a well known friend, but it is *not* a good movie. It is insipid, mean spirited and uninspired. It is not worth watching for its own merit"
" I'm pretending this doesn't exist
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,1,"This movie not only sucks, but ruins the first. Please, DO NOT WATCH. I'm just going to live my life pretending this movie was never made and Paul's life continued as we would have expected it to go after the end of the first movie. That movie was a treasure. This one is trash."
" its good
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,8,"(only if you like that kind of humour)if you wanna see something serious see an other movie, its classic Blart"
" Better than Police Academy 4
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,10,"You know how some sequels are considered better than the original? Terminator 2, Aliens, Road Warrior, and, of course, Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol.Well, in my book (Blartmania, coming early 2021 from Viking Press) you can add Paul Blart 2 to that list. PB2(as the fans, aka, Blartheads, call it) takes all the elements from PB1 and amps them up 11. (That's a reference to a movie that's not nearly as funny as either PB 1 or PB2, btw)PB2 has it all: a David Lynch-inspired scene featuring a piano player and a peacock, an old lady getting punched in the stomach, the Fabulous Thunderbirds ""Wrap It Up"", and an avant-garde stage show that makes ""Goddess"" from ""Showgirls"" look like ""A Private Dance"", also from ""Showgirls"".Throw in vibrating forks, a KISS tribute band composed of little people (yeah, a KISS tribute band made up of little people. Bet you wish you had though of that, don't you, Mr. Failed Comedy Writer?) and Adam Sandler's wife and what do you have?Only the best sequel ever made."
" Could have been better.
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,5,"Unfortunately despite huge effort from Kevin James, the films fails to match the first movie. It isn't bad at all,there are some laughs to be had but the plot is just to far fetched and the supporting cast isn't great.. Its worth a watch, did well at the box office but unlike the first one, you'll probably only watch it once"
" A Neigh to This One
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,1,"This movie shouldn't have been made in the first place. It pulled the ""Go Set a Watchman"" in the Paul Blart universe, completely ruining the heroic goodness of Blart and making him out to be a dickhead. Maybe Paul Blart isn't on the same level as Atticus Finch... But, the film ruined Blart regardless.
Also, for a stupid crime comedy, the comedy was weak and the plot was surprisingly difficult to follow. I'd go as far as to say there wasn't much of a plot at all. As for the weak comedy, the only jokes that were funny were few and far between and involved a horse.
This movie is generic, dumb, and shouldn't have been made, just as the second *Benchwarmers *movie shouldn't have been made."
" It's growing on me
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,7,"I saw ""Paul Blart: Mart Cop 2"" in the theater (AMC Westbury, NY). I liked it then but I was a little disappointed. I'm such a fan of the original movie that I had my expectations too high. I enjoy it more now then I did then. It is an uneven movie but more of it works than doesn't. Kevin James and company deliver quite a few laugh and a bunch of goodwill. I'll keep watching ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2"" but I won't watch it as much as I watch the original. Honorable mention: a dreamy Daniella Alonso."
" Even better than the first.
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,9,Loved the first movie they definitely topped the first one.laughed from start to finish.
" Paul Blart, the best of the 2010's
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,10,Paul Blart: Mall cop (The original movie) was better. But this movie was not far away to be as good as that one. I can see that Kevin James and all other cast put there soul in this movie. Hope to see a Paul Blart: Mall cop 3.
" Mall Clop 2
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,1,Should've called it Paul Blart: Fall Cop because that's the only joke in this movie.
" Amusing and uplifting
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,6,"Not bad at all. Depends on your expectations. It's not a master work. But if you expect a 1/10 rate comedy movie, you'll be surprised and then Paul Blart won't deceive you."
" Disgusting
",2019-12-13 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a sad, sad excuse for a sequel. I watched this with high hopes when it came out in 2015, as I do love Paul Blart: mall cop. But this was quite the disappointment. Since then I haven't been able to speak of the movie without getting so agitated I have to call my therapist."
" Holy Mary
",2019-11-28 00:00:00,3,"Good Lord, what was that? I rate 3 stars and that is being generous."
" Funny, Entertaining, great movie all round
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,10,"An overall really funny film,even if it isn't as good as the first.A great story throughout which adds to the many moments that made me laugh.A brilliant film and a must watch."
" Execrable
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,1,"What did I just watch? This movie is absolutely awful. Obviously a shameless cash grab riding on the coat tails of the first.
It's a supposed comedy that's just plain unfunny.
Don't believe the 10/10 reviews on here, they're obviously paid for, fake reviews. How am I so sure? Only a reviewer on here describing this steaming pile of dung as ""art""."
" The only good to come out of it is the foreshadowing of the end of Kevin James' ""career""
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,1,"Lets face it, Kevin James is a talent-free hack who can't be counted upon to carry his own belly for more than an hour, let alone a movie. This movie deserves all the credit in the world for exposing this blatant fact once more for the public to see. Not realizing he was already pushing his luck tumbling his way onto becoming a C-list TV ""star"", ol' chubby James probably thought he could make the transition to the big screen and carry over his dumb, clumsy, man-child persona successfully, riding on the coattails of his shmucky looking face and folksy mannerisms (the relatable round shape of the body for the average American also helps).Well, he didn't. The movie is a flop in many ways. The plot is stale and predictable, the characters are bereft of depth, intelligence and nuance. The tired old shticks such as the underdog tale (professional and romantic) don't even come close to being emotionally invested in. Kevin James does nothing to improve any of the above, either."
" Blart Side of The Moon
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,10,This movie is a 10 but only when synchronized with Pink Floyd's Dark Side of The Moon
" I mean what is there to really say?
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,2,"I mean what is there to really say? It is what it is. In the never ending vein of comedy sequels, one that is not warranted will always be in the mix. This time, ""Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2"" ladies and gentlemen. Kevin James once again proves why he is just an unlikable actor. Sure, he has had a few hits and/or decent performances, but when he continues to lead films like this, it only furthers his downward spiral. This time, Pul Blart is invited to a convention in Las Vegas, where he is lead to believe he will be receiving an award. Like every other cliche in the movie, of course a conflict had to happen. Paul Blart becomes the hero taking down bad guys again, and it is as unfunny as it is unnecessary. This film defines why we no longer need sequels to comedies, especially ones that never worked in the first place. There is not much to say about this picture really. It's script is horribly lazy, it's direction is un-inspired, and the comedy is slim to none. There is a forced attempt to make you care about the father daughter relationship, but it keeps going back and forth to the point that I didn't care. In the end, you know exactly what to expect going in, nothing good."
" worse than The Room
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,1,"The headline explains it all.
 A lot of his most toxic traits are presented as good or charming and i fear for all young children who watch this. I can only hope they weren't influenced by this.
Also the movie isn't funny.
Please don't watch. Please. I beg of you."
" What a garbage fire
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,1,"This is actually my least favorite movie I've ever seen. They made Paul a completely unlikeable sex offender and I hated every second he was on screen. This movie actually gave me cancer, I feel the the tumors growing on my back."
" I spent $3 on this movie and I hate it
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,1,This man Paul blart acts like an actual sexual offender and I can't believe I watched it.
" Awful
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,1,Presumably people who gave this movie a 10 and a glowing review are being sarcastic because this movie is awful. Wooden characters with no reason to like them. Typical Kevin James fat jokes which aren't funny. How are these films funded?
" Trying to be a legend
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,3,"To me it seems he is trying to be John Candy, fails on all accounts, but I wish him well.
With writers who can get the best out of Kevin then I hope he can be an actor I wish to watch.
Not really a rating of this film, but an average of all I have seen(which is most) so mid range."
" Poor
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,1,"Well this is just poor quite frankly.The first one, while not being great, at least made sense, and you rooted for the main character.This is contrast is just weak. The lovely ending of the first is quickly shot through, and Paul becomes increasingly unlikeable as the film progresses.Sometimes the powers that be should just be grateful a film was a hit, and not try and milk it with a sequel."
" Ignore the reviews
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,8,"This is the first time I write a review on IMDb, just because of the fact there is a lot of really stupid reviews here, with people telling it was a non-funny movie while they probably haven't even watched it (some reviews written before the movie was even released). I've laughed my ass off two days in a row, first with my gf, the day after with my parents.My parents really don't like watching movies with lots of cussing or sex scenes so I thought I'd show them Mall Cop 2: it's completely family friendly. The script is just fine, the jokes are both dumb but also go a little deeper if you keep your head with it.If you want to watch a funny movie (with children or eldery) you should really watch this one!"
" Best Movie Ever!
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,10,"You can throw every other movie out the window because compared to this they all stink! Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 is a beautifully written, beautifully performed masterpiece and will forever go down in history as the greatest cinematic blockbuster of all time!"
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,1,I watched about 5 minutes and that was enough for me to determine it deserves a half star rating (0 viewings)
" LOVED IT!! SOOO GOOD!
",2019-06-04 00:00:00,10,"My husband kept asking me what was so funny as I watched this (he was playing video games as I watched this movie on my laptop with headphones beside him). I just couldn't stop full out laughing. A clean and funny movie! I replayed some of the funny parts for him and even my husband laughed, who doesn't like corny things, and couldn't help but shake his head and chuckle. Almost didn't watch it because of all the bad reviews but then I read a few positive ones and I decided to give it a try. If you like corny or ""dad jokes"" this will be enjoyable! Go into realizing it's a corn ball movie and choose to see the hilarity in the extreme goofy. Recommending this one to friends and family after I finish writing this review!"
" Even Worse Than The First One!
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,3,"Why on Earth would I choose to watch this movie when I disliked the first one so much? An excellent question that is! Honestly, I didn't really want to watch this, but my roommates were watching it so I joined them.It was bad! It makes the first one seem good. I suppose there are some people who would enjoy it, but they must be very drunk people. Everything about this movie is bad. The jokes are bad, the acting is bad, it's all so very bad. Do not recommend."
" Not good
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,4,"This isn't a good movie. Maybe cute, but not good. It's not even funny."
" Blart Side of the Moon
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,10,"Don't get me wrong, this is a terrible movie. The only reason to watch it is when it is on mute and is synched up with Pink Floyd's ""Dark Side of the Moon"". Trust me, that is an experience!"
" Make a 3rd
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,10,This movie was a super good comedy. It's perfect for Christmas time.
" Great for all ages.
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,10,"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a majestically magnificent master piece, it is my 580th movie that i Tried / Finished but it ended up in one of my top 3. The game is colossal & amazingly excellent in every perspective. World Design : 
Game world is colossal & gorgeous, excellently designed with exclusive & extensive details such as fallen trees are regrown just like in real life, burned or cut down portions of forests, Dead whale on a shore & various type of fish under water are just very few such examples. 
It is a Living breathing world monsters will also attack other animals, wolves will hunt rabbits & dears. During cloudy weather you will be able to see clouds moving in the sky & shooting stars at night. 
Game have excellently implemented dynamic weather cycle, day and night cycle as you will see a dramatic difference between day and night life. Visuals : 
Graphically game is stunning and even more gorgeous after the latest patch. Animations are top class and facial animations are impressive. Narrative : 
Story is impressive and easy to understand, no matter how many or all the side quests you play; you still wont get lost. Game offers the opportunity to enjoy company of beautiful characters & decent humor. 
Choosing dialogues is one of the best part of the game & Dialogue options are one of the best with various types of choices with provides an enjoyable experience. Unique Features : 
Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 have some unique features that you wont find any where else such as Paul Blart beard physics. Other examples are :- On Skellige : Gedyneith (Name Of Place) there is A House Under A tree when you visit that place for the 1st time you will see a dude plowing in soil but when you go there later you will see plants. You will see many changes in dandelions inn & main hall in Kaer Trolde castle throughout the game. Combat : 
Combat is enjoyable, addictive, tactical and superb both ways offensive & defensive. AI is intelligent & will use various defensive measures. Despite high level enemies you still can defeat them with tactics & patience. 
Other than basic close combat and ranged weapon, there are bombs & sign abilities (Basically Magic). You can use your ability points on skills but will choose wisely b/z you cant acquire them all as it is an RPG With choices & consequences, But you can reset them with potion. Other activities : 
Beside side quests there are witcher contracts and treasure hunting, you can also participate in horse racing, boxing & playing cards. The card game is also very fun & extremely addictive. Replayability : 
I doubt that some one will play this game once as of the colossal dialogue choices. The game felt vastly different while selecting different dialogues through second game play. I finished it twice and i am gone buy Complete addition & play it all over again."
" Up there wit 2001 a space odyssey and the Schindler's li+st
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,10,"Lets go through 2 key scenes in the film, the first scene is a masterpiece, the direction of sanely Kubrick in this scene is incredible, I was supersede that they used dark magic and a blood sacrifice to bring him back but it was well worth it. 
The jokers heist on the mall is jaw dropping they did it all in 1 take and they got Denial Day Lewis to play the joker, how incredible.
And the last scene where Paul Blart breaks out of the prison by digging a hole through the wall and then covering it up with a poster is absolute film making genius, and then the very last shot where Paul is standing out in the rain is such an overwhelming amount of emotion that i simply can not convay to you in this review, 
 Your's truly Rhys."
" Slapstick and Kevin James antics saves the day
",2018-05-24 00:00:00,5,"For both part 1 and 2, I will give Kevin James the points for trying to bring out new formula to decennia-old antics . Yes, it is slapstick humor which will not be appreciated by the politically correct. Blart rhymes with you know what so the switch gear should be set back a few times and be easy on your intelligence accelerator. Kevin James must have planned a sequel because his material is not enough for just one film so like his line in the film - fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. Since we are just passive watchers we should not be ashamed that we have seen this film ( even twice). Just think of it, variety is the spice of life and it can be tiring to demand quality all the time. Not everyday is a steak day."
" Infinitely Amazing
",2018-04-25 00:00:00,10,"My eyes are getting weary
My back is getting tight
I'm sitting here in traffic on the Queensborough bridge tonight
But, I don't care 'cause all I want to do...
is cash my check and drive right home to you
'cause Baby, all my life
I will be driving home to you"
" Don't watch it.
",2018-04-03 00:00:00,2,"Do you ever watch a movie and pause at one moment and just think to yourself: Why? Why am I watching this? That's how I felt when Paul Blart was lying on the casino floor licking ice cream off of it. Paul Blart: Mall Cop (the first movie) is a harmless comedy that's just a lot of slapstick and goofy humor. In this adventure, Paul Blart and his daughter Maya, now grown up, go to Las Vegas for a convention after his mother gets run over by a bus. Maya tries to get romantically involved with this dude, but Blart, being the overprotective father he is, disapproves. Meanwhile, this bland heterochromic villain attempts to steal Van Gogh's Sunflowers, which for some reason is at the Wynn. Oh, yeah, another thing that sucks about this movie is that it seems like an ad for the Wynn. The signage on the hotels, while present throughout Las Vegas, is seen often throughout this movie. While the Wynn is probably is an extravagant place to stay, we don't need that much product placement in this movie. Plus, if you're spending your money to see this movie, you're probably too young for Vegas anyway. Anyway, the villain's eye color is the most memorable thing about him. What was his name again? So, after that, it's nothing but generic slapstick humor and clichÃ© plot points. Way too much of the humor depends on Blart's hypoglycemia, which is not particularly funny, especially after its been done before. There's also a scene where he gets his ass kicked by a goose. There's one where he falls down stairs in a suitcase, and also a lot of jokes involving the use of Blart's Segway. It's just forgettable, generic, and above all, not funny. But what do you really expect? It's a comedy sequel. The list of good comedy sequels is very short, and this certainly isn't on it."
" Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 was a blast 2!
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,10,"Often, a sequel can fail to live up to the original, particularly when it was made later to cash in on the popularity of the first. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 lives up to all expectations, and is a must-see for anyone who has seen Paul Blart: Mall Cop, which in itself is a must-see film. This time, we see a different Paul Blart. He has lost many of those close to him, and his daughter is about to go off to university. On top of this, during the climax of this film, he is away from his home-turf and up against even tougher foes, a top-level gang of project criminals! The pacing is again excellent. We are introduced to all the key characters and locations towards the start of the film, while not left bored waiting for the action to begin. The themes of security and art present in this film are well-presented in the visual style, just as the theme of a shopping centre was constantly seen in the original. The plot itself is again solid, and refreshingly not simply the same plot as the original. We are also given a large selection of new gags, as well as a few cheeky homages to the original. As ever, Kevin James delivers a strong performance. In conclusion, 10/10. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 will have you stood up, chanting BLART BLART SHOPPING CART by the end. We can only hope the next one arrives before 2021!"
" I love this movie but my friend made fun of me for it
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,10,I watched this with a friend and we bouth laughed and enjoyed it but he called me gay behind my back the next day :((
" Help someone today
",2018-01-25 00:00:00,7,"Kevin James revives his role as the over confident and delusional Paul Blart, the ""strange misshapen super hero"" mall cop from New Jersey. The first few minutes of this film cleanses the events at the end of the last film. Blart goes to Las Vegas for a Mall Cop convention, something a joke within itself as was his speech glorifying the position as life's aspiration. Nothing like making fun of the blue collar service sector.In Vegas, there is a subplot of art thieves (Neal McDonough) and Blart being put down by hotel security. There is a display of high tech low impact weapons that are also part of the demeaning of the profession. It isn't hard to figure out the outcome even at the age of five. When Blart's daughter (Raini Rodriguez) is kidnapped, Blart doesn't exactly go into Liam Neeson mode, but something closer to a combination of Inspector Clouseau and Jerome Lester Horwitz.If you have grown tired of hearing ""Best Day of My Life"" like 80's folk tired of ""Betty Davis Eyes"" you have been warned about the over used sound track.Guide: kid safe. A PG closer to G than PG-13"
" Fat Guy Fall Down Go Boom, Ha Ha!
",2017-10-20 00:00:00,2,"Paul Blart is a fat mall security guard who falls down a lot and takes his job way too seriously. That is what this entire movie, no wait actually two movies, is based on. I guess we are supposed to find it funny every single time he falls down on the ground because he is overweight?Also he has a silly little mustache so I guess that is also supposed to make us laugh non stop too. Every single character in these movies is unbelievable and annoying. The writing is garbage and none of the predictable jokes are funny.Please stop making Paul Blart and please stop watching Paul Blart. These movies will kill your brain."
" Destination Las Vegas!
",2017-10-04 00:00:00,3,"One of the worst week for me as most of the of films I've seen were not up to any good. Okay, fine, the first part was decent. I thought a little refresher, somewhat funny too, so on such scenario, anticipating a sequel is common, but this is not what I wanted. After seeing this, I come to realise that the sequel was a bad idea. Seems funny, but no impact. In fact a little boring to see the same old comedy tricks again. Especially mocking a fat man is too offensive at the present era. So the hashtag on body shaming would go viral on social media.They did not get a decent story. Even the film characters, including the villains were too old fashioned. Even this film had made in the 90s, might have not received well too. The concept of going vacation-come-convention, we had seen this before, are not we! Yeah, Paul after his short marriage and losing mother, he and his daughter heads to Las Vegas. Being watchful father and meeting his old friends, the adventure begins, when some criminal activity is going on behind the conference. His plan to save his daughter, as well as thwart the crime are the remaining focus of the film.I felt for a character like Paul Blart, casting Raini Rodriguez as his daughter was a little too much intentional. Yeah, the film was full of television guys every corner. Its not just direction, or performance failed, it was the writing. This kind of comedies is now considered ancient, that's why Rowan Atkinson stopped doing his routine comedies. But now it's certain that there won't be a third. If you had seen the first and not sure about this, believe me, you won't miss anything. Instead, I would suggest you to re-watch the original. That ain't a masterpiece, though a much better one.3/10"
" This movie changed my life for the better and I couldn't be happier.
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,10,"This movie changed my life. It made my wife come back to me, cured both my children of malaria, and reversed my male pattern baldness and erectile dysfunction. My wife is so pleased! When watching this movie, expect to be in for a dramatically life changing experience. Although the first was downright mediocre, this sequel surpassed all expectations I could possibly have formed and then some. My boss even hired my back to the stapler company. This movie reveals the duality of man and the strength of the bond between father and daughter that can surpass time, space, and malls. Fin"
" A Disappointing Sequel
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,4,"The original Paul Blart is great and there ain't no debate. It was a movie for all ages, and delivered countless thrills. Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 on the other hand was not as memorable. Then again, the first film was lightning in a bottle and it would have taken a miracle to recreate that magic. The sequel lacks the memorable action sequences of the first film. The most noteworthy action beat in the movie is when Paul Blart expertly punches an elderly woman in the stomach. The worst part is it was not even a fair fight. If the old lady was aware of the attack i'm sure she would have held her own, especially if she had access to kryptonite. The movie is also disappointing when it comes to the supporting cast. Justin Russo from Wizards of Waverly Place appears in the film and he doesn't even perform any magic to aid Paul Blart on his quest. Overall though, the movie is not that bad. What holds it all together is that it still carries the same inspirational message as the first film. With a killer moustache, a little confidence, and a high-powered segway, you too can take out a building full of armed criminals. #AlwaysBetOnBlart"
" Tried to make it live up to the original, failed tremendously
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,3,"This movie tried so hard to be funny like the first one. Had a really cheesy storyline. Paul Blart (Kevin James) the main character was too slim to fit his old chubby persona. Sloppy writing/bad jokes. Mistake in the movie at about 1 hr 10 mins (you can see the boomstick)My summary (OPINION) about the movie Paul Blart (Kevin James) was a really giddy happy funny character in the first movie, started off introducing his glaucoma and that he needed sugar every 5 mins or so, then in this movie it seems to have lessened? The glaucoma somehow got better (impossible) without medicine.And he isn't really a ""Mall Cop"" so to say in this movie."
" the bestest movie ever made ever.
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,1,"Paul Blart Mall Cop 2 is honestly one of the best films ever made, up there with Birdemic shock and terror and cars 2 This masterpiece has something for everyone, it has comedy, action, drama, romance, horror and an extremely well done, totally original story and all its jokes are super smartly written, especially where he says he is independent but is scared of being alone or something like that."
" Kevin James is the next Messiah
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,1,"The main joke of everything in this movie may be described in the following short list. Kevin James is fat, Kevin James is lonely, Kevin James is out of touch, or any combinations of those atrocities. Here's the main problem, Adam ""lucifer"" Sandler's company, Happy Madison has tried to turn Kevin James into a poor man that is looked down upon by others. This has been his plan all along, because Kevin James is supposed to be the next messiah. If we keep letting Mr. Sandler destroy Kevin James' image we will have no messiah to lead us in our war efforts Against the next plan to destroy the world by Satan. So don't be fooled, Kevin James is a holy man and Adam Sandler is trying to convert us to in to followers of Satan."
" Meh...

" Low on laughs and comedy
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,2,"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is the sequel to the highly successful film released in 2009. It is well obvious that the main reason as to why this film was given a sequel was due to the success of the original film. Many wonder as to why it took as long as it did (6 years). Had this film came out roughly 2 or 3 years after the original, perhaps this sequel would have generated more input and been more successful. Within the film, Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2 is a relatively simple plot and storyline. This time instead of Paul Blart being a security guard on duty for his local mall, he has been invited to Las Vegas, and plays officer in one of their wonderful hotels, with mainly the running around occurring in their casino. For starters, this film lacks the depth and genuine comedy of the original (although the original was not great or too funny, it had several laughs). This sequel is quite dull and time pasts quite quickly with predictable and reused jokes. The jokes are the same rehash of ""fay guy jokes"" with Kevin James making a fool of himself, seen falling down, hiding behind objects, and a scene where he fights with a large CGI bird. Neal McDonough is the typical villain and he plays his role well, as it is something he has done throughout his career.Overall, this sequel was not needed, though it still made over $107 million worldwide (more than it's budget back) but did not make as much as the original (which was obvious). A positive about the film is the scenery of the hotel and the overall landscape. Certainly just a one time watch, if even at that."
" Second greatest film of all time!
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,10,"Paul blart:mall cop was good and a classic,but Paul blart:mall cop 2 was a greater film than the original! There should be more movies like this! Kevin James was the best actor ever,and he is a true American! Raini Rodriguez was beautiful as maya blart,Paul blart's daughter! The other security guards in this movie were almost as great as Paul blart,especially Saul gundermutt! Daniella Alonso was stunning in this film as well! The plot was great because the writing was hilarious! You've got to see this film! Hopefully Kevin James will make Paul blart:mall cop 3!"
