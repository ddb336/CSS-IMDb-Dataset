" Don't order a cheeseburger if you're short on time
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,6,"The movie was much more entertaining than I thought. Fast-paced. Acting is good.Of course, the movie has the usual ""omnipotent omniscient"" bad guys, which make no sense.Ending was a bit disappointing.Still watchable if you like Saw-like movies"
" A gem.
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,9,"This underrated little gem of a film delivers everything that many big budget horror productions attempt to, on a much smaller budget, with a cast of lesser-known actors. Despite it being a remake of a Thai film called ""13: Game Of Death"", this flick has proven to be one of my personal favorites among more modern horror. Like the best remakes of foreign films, it keeps the plot and many elements of the original intact, but lends a more American flavor to them. In many film's cases, this means rampant jumpscares and crappy CGI, but not here. The premise of both films serves to highlight the corruption of capitalism, the way in which the wealthy exploit the suffering with the promise of riches in payment for unjust actions, and how far one person is willing to go just for a large paycheck. This is highlighted in an early scene, in which the main character is asked to scam a customer out of money, and refuses, thus losing his job. He has to resort to much the same, and even worse, over the course of the ""game"" that is central to the film.Audiences will be able to sympathize with the main character here, a decent guy whose life is spiraling out of control thanks to debts, corruption and personal issues. He is played with great depth by Mark Webber, always an underrated indie actor, who gives one of his strongest performances to date here. Daniel Stamm ratchets up a boiling head of steam in the director's chair, making this a truly intense, suspenseful film, where complications and tensions build on top of each other until the result becomes chaotic and suffocating. There's also some incredible set-pieces which provide some of the most memorable, brutal moments of horror in recent memory. The script manages to steadily unfurl a series of jaw-dropping twists, without ever becoming too busy or unbelievable. The whole thing is like a well-oiled machine, mounting to a meaningful, complex ending. It functions both as a genuinely effective horror/thriller and a genre film with something to say. All the while a streak of black comedy underlines the proceedings. Truly a top notch example of what independent genre filmmaking should be, and can achieve."
" A fantastic concept turned stupid at the end
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,4,"The last 10-15 mins were pure stupidity. Had it made sense, the movie could've gotten great returns ."
" Fun and Dumb
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,6,"It's fine. Acting was good, a lot of tense moments but I don't feel like they really took it all the way there. Ending was DUMB."
" A good effort
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,6,"The lead charater is broken to an extent that he is soon engulfed into situations which had quick money but takes something in return. Frankly, people do fall prey to such things which do involve quick and easy money; you have to JUST do these simple steps and a huge sum awaits your doorstep.The concept was genuine, if fantasical. The characters acting and situations were also good and appreciable. Even the timings were good. But, still, i felt a broader line which had something missing to make movie turn the cards and come out as a remarkable masterpeice. Yes, even if everything was good, still i can't rate it more than above average.Now let me come as to why i feel so. First the thrill, which i felt was missing from the place. Seriously, for such concept movies, you need to be strong in showcasing adrenaline effect shots. The viewer should be at the edge of his seat while watching. The second was the background score. Not clumsy but definitely not upto mark. Third, the movie picked up with a mood and soon i felt it lacked the same. Like, i guessed the situations beforehand. And that means the mystery is on its toes, there is nothing left to demystify. Yes, there were still some elements which were hidden but i kind of felt them as under achiever.All in all, an average copied result. Let me give a try to its Thai version and check how that is."
" worth the watch
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,7,I am a huge fan of psychological thrillers and was definitely pleased by this film. This film wasn't the best but is worth the watch. The subtle hints and foreshadowing in the beginning were put together very well for a plot twist ending that makes sense yet isn't too predictable. The ending is a little frustrating to swallow though.
" Loved It!
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,7,A little bit predictable but overall a great movie!!!
" Original is better,but this one is ok too)))

" Game of Phones
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,6,"I don't know how to take this, but an overseas friend told me to watch this and imagine him as the caller here. This was to tell me if I would date him in real life or not. Watch this and you decide.Well, #1 I doubt he has about six million to offer me. Second, I'm not sure I'd do even three of these things commanded in this movie because despite me being a slave to money, I know right from wrong and I don't allow people to pull my strings. No matter the price.But, as stated, I *am* a slave to money...I digress. This movie is part Saw. Part The Game. And all-fun for a small independent version of the two. Good for these people to make a full, feature-length on a tenth of the budget with solid acting and production design. It's definitely Fantasy and could've used more of The Voice (from the phone,) but it's a little fun ride to see where it'd end. Even despite the predictability.Elliot is a little wimpy father-to-be who receives a phone call to kill a fly. He does and the game's on. In other words, he now has 12 more challenges to reach a goal of both: almost six million dollars and to dodge the police for his inevitable crime spree of greed. Can ""poor"" Elliot follow the rules of a seemingly omnipotent caller, or does he retain some of his soul and win the game of Life?It's easy to watch and insert your own actions to what this character should do and I did just that. There are always ways out of situations, but that's really Monday Morning Quarterbacking. I will say: while the movie's watchable throughout despite the stress of his 13 progressively harder goals...the very ending is a letdown. I understand it, but still: that much, I'd change from my own story.So, okay, yeah, bring this on. I'll do it. I'll have to block out any soul I have left, but I'm good at blocking out the bad I've done ""in my past.""***Final thoughts: As for that friend, who will surely read this as he DID request I'd watch this and write a review: you better have the money ready."
" Wicked
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,7,"13 sins is quite a ride and moves within seconds from pitchblack and macabre humor to gruesome and bizarr horror.
The opening sequence sets already the tone but is only a glimpse of what to expect. during the movie I came more than once to the point not knowing if I should laugh or hide my face...the challenges become obviously more and more intense and the twists coming with it got me simply off guard. Most certainly a special, original thriller with even a moral undertone. How far are u willing to go ? and - what if all the cruel things happening on a big and on a small scale in daily life are considered for some only as a sick game?"
" Recommended 3 stars.
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,7,"They are sure some movies that sure surprise you in a good way. When I decided to watch it on Netflix this morning , I knew nothing about this or have seen the trailer. Just saying because Netflix sure carries a lot of crap on their streaming library. So I really had a good time watching this with my cup of coffee.Elliot Brindle is a salesman who loses his job with bills to pay and having his handicap brother and abusive elderly father to look after as well. So this is when he receives this mysterious phone call offering him money to do weird and odd things like eat a fly just as soon he sees his bank account has been credited with money he continues with the challenges, with other challenges becoming more risker and more rewarding. If he fails to complete any of the challenges or reveals that he is playing the game he will be disqualified and will have to give up his winnings.It's dark and humorous, good cast and good story. Being the spooky Halloween season it should be on everyone's watch list this month. I guess this was my October's surprise. Lol"
" Utter rubbish
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,4,"I'm never ever going to enjoy a Grand Prix celebration ever again ,without thinking about this awful movie .The actual production of the movie is good .The idea is original but the acting is just rotten"
" Only the Twists Saved It
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,7,"It is almost October which means Halloween it here (in my world, at least) and it is time to open the Spookathon archives.This October I'm kicking off with any films that are classed as horror in my watch list since my watch list is getting uncontrollable at 2,652 films. The second film I've chosen from it was 13 Sins.Whew, was this film a roller coaster. Similar to Saw, Would You Rather? and other similar films of the sub-genre, I didn't expect to really like this film. I expected it to be another attempt at the genre following the cult following that so many people are starting to cling to. I expected maybe a subpar B rated horror but I was pleasantly surprised.This film has many twists that are just brilliant, that keep you on edge throughout the film. The acting was good, the plot was very well written, and I enjoyed it. More carnage and emotional guilt tripping with a gripping story line.The twists saved it more for the genre it's in. If there had been no surprises, I think this would have been much closer to a 2.5 out of 5, too similar to other ""reality tv show horror"" films to stand out much further, but it did stand out pretty well.I've not much more to say on it other than that; good film for it's subgenre, good carnage, amazing twists."
" Interesting psychological extortion story with a funny twist
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,10,"Solid action thriller. Good story that really puts one in the shoes of the affected. Without blowing it with spoilers: Who woudn't like to be tempted by performing a sequence of absurd acts like that in the face of a sizeable amount of money? I would. Interesting and novel story, with Increasing tension and adrenaline throughout said sequence, with occasional sudden lows and apparent reliefs, but the game never ends, as more and more absurdity is required. Ending would be more interesting if the end twist was different: Instead of blowing it, the hero could have avoided the final act. Beware of the game!"
" Enjoyable, Fun film
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,7,"I wasn't expecting this to be good but I really enjoyed it! The plot was compelling and fast-paced- there was almost never a dull moment. You get invested in the character's journey and are constantly wondering what's going to happen next. If you liked the movie ""Would You Rather,"" you'll definitely like this one (I honestly preferred this one because it was less gory). It's a great incorporation of horror into the classic ""would you do ___ for this much money"" game."
" Surprisingly good
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,7,"For a low budget horror I was expecting this to be a corny schlockfest, but Webber's great performance and the direction help it rise above similar style films, like Would You Rather, The Invitation or 2017's Escape Room.The premise is typical of a 'dare' horror - 13 challenges that get more despicable as the film progresses. You know what to expect. The plot isn't much more than the premise would suggest, but there's enough little diversions from the standard tropes here and there to keep it interesting.The pacing of the film was one of the biggest surprise. It was novel to see a horror film that knew when to take a breather rather than forcing the plot to ramp up and up until they realise there's no budget left. Not only does it help the film to play out it's runtime without becoming a chore, but it also gives Webber a chance to add some heart to the role. His broken character really shines above the rest of the quite generic production. Once or twice it took quite large jumps of disbelief to think the character wouldn't just jack out of the game, but there were a few different motivations that were used to great effect. Webber should definitely be in more stuff!Then there's Ron Perlman. He's in it... for some reason? His part largely appears to be a week's shooting for the credit on the poster. But he's never a let down, even if he doesn't have much to chew on. He's in neutral gear throughout.Of the low budget horror films on Netflix that I had never heard of before, this was definitely one of the best ones I've seen. Worth checking out for sure!"
" 13 Sins - 5/10
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,5,"Mean-spirited, slightly exploitative and blackly comic, 13 sins is somewhat unique in terms of its tone. However, the overall concept doesn't feel all that original, which is understandable considering it's an American remake, but even taking that into account, it still feels akin to film's like ""The Game"" and the more recent ""Would You Rather."" Ron Perlman was front-and-centre on the poster for this I saw, so I was under the impression that his role in the story would be a bit bigger. Nevertheless, he's always entertaining to watch and he does a pretty good disgruntled cop here. The movie sees a desperate, indebted man take part in a series of increasingly monstrous tasks. The tasks themselves are all pretty good, but the protagonist's execution is sometimes frustrating or could've been done better. Speaking of the protagonist, played my Mark Webber, he wasn't really the most likeable character to begin with, so I was never really bothered as to whether he won or not. There's a few twists thrown in at the end, but they don't all work and one in particular was very obvious. Some fun gore effects and a few memorable moments, especially the one involving the motorbikes. I don't think I'll watch this again, but that's not to say it's a bad film. I usually don't mind a mean-spirited movie, but this one didn't really seem to have a point to make behind all the nastiness."
" A good entertainer
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,7,"The actor Mark gave his best performance in this film whose character was built good. The 13 sins was the 13 challenges to be completed by a player to win a cash prize, where the 13 sins was made good. The screenplay was really good, I didn't get bored at any portions and it moved fast scene by scene. If the viewers wants to know about a deadly games, really what's happening in it and how it will end up, you can see this movie without any hesitations. It was a good entertainer for an one and half hour and worth watching. This film also tells us a social message indirectly."
" Unbelievably Dark ~ I love it!
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,9,"Yeah.
Be prepared.
This movie is terrifically dark. Kind of like Weekend at Bernies without the lightheartedness.
But damn. It's funny, too.
More than that, it looks at the question of 'What would you do?'.
It lays the ground work to understand the character's motivation and then spirals completely out of control in the most deliberate fashion.
Well done."
" Pretty good
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,7,"A friend recommended this to me so we decided to watch it last night. Nothing really scary about it, a few stomach turning scenes, but all in all mild for this genre.
I will say the end pissed me off a little, I mean, why would he make that choice?"
" Great movie but
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,6,"What a disappointment it was going great till the end they just had to ruin it by the main character breaking the rules to get disqualified and lose the money - WHAT THE HELL??? So he goes through every challenge including killing a family member to just lose everything. All he had to do was walk away have his name cleared for breaking 13 majopr laws including murder get married to his fiance and live happily ever after with 7 million dollars in his bank account. But no he had to kill the poor cop in the end to revenge his asshole racist dad who literally sexually abused his fiance and a brother who not only killed 15 innocent people but also stabbed him and tried to kill him. The cop was a nobody he even said it ""I'm just an employee"" so what was the point killing him. The ending just spoiled the whole movie for me, yes it's worth a watch but in the end of the movie you may feel cheated too, like you've just wasted your time on this movie."
" A decent thriller that could have been great.
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,5,"A desperate, debt-ridden salesman (Mark Webber), receives a cryptic phone call promising him millions of dollars if he agrees to perform 13 increasingly hideous tasks in this remake of the 2006 Thai comedy horror film 13 Beloved directed by Daniel Stamm. It's a decent thriller that could (and should) have been great. Stamm's film is solidly helmed, but is over-reliant on unnecessarily grisly comeuppances that leave nothing to the imagination. The movie received it's premier at the 2014 SXSW film festival before being released theatrically. The cast includes Ron Perlman (who had not seen the original film, as he did not want it to influence his performance) and features the final film appearance of George Coe before his death in 2015."
" Freaking and interesting
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,7,"I liked the idea of this movie. It's like Saw, disturbing and interesting at the same time. It shows how far a person can go for money or to save his own life."
" This is a wild ride!
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,7,"The premise is over the top. There's no way any moderately sane person would continue doing these ever escalating, horrendous tasks. Especially a meek underachiever, who is seamlessly transformed into a raving lunatic. But by God, it works! The suspense factor and pace will keep you attached. The last fifteen minutes had me sitting with my mouth hanging open. Some wild surprises! Definitely worth a watch."
" Pretty Good Thriller!
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,6,"This 2014 thriller stars Mark Webber and Rutina Wesley.
This tells about a young man, Elliot (Webber) who is about to be married to his pregnant fiancée, Shelby (Wesley), but has financial troubles. Soon, he gets a mysterious phone call involving a sinister game he must choose to play and complete 13 challenges. This is pretty good until the last 15 minutes and the film is sort of similar to ""Would You Rather?"" You may like this if you don't mind violence, gore & suspense."
" Good film but the ending was abit smelly
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,6,"Incredible concept for a film. It was Abit unrealistic at times like how did they see him at all times and how did that guy who got the top of his chopped off still be able to crawl. It also really annoyed me how the guy could've just let not shot that guy and he could've lived his life as a millionaire. But no, he just had to shoot him. All in all the film was actually decent, it just had a few faults."
" You know what, it's actually not bad
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,6,"I went into this with 0 expectations and I'm actually quite surprised. It gripped me, especially the first hour or so. I was intrigued to see how it would all pan out. My main issue with the film was that the twist at the end was actually relatively obvious and that the characters would make the occasional bizarre decision. But overall it's definitely worth watching.Ps if you are watching because Netflix states it's a horror then don't bother. It's more of a thriller."
" Uncomfortable and consistently tense
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,7,"I wasn't expecting much, which is a good way to be pleasantly surprised by little gems like these. Imagine The Game meets Saw. It's paced like The Game, gruesome like Saw, and has enough plot twists and suspense to keep you watching all the way to the credits.A down-on-his-luck, mild-mannered guy gets an opportunity of a lifetime in the form of a bizarre game consisting of ever worsening challenges. Each challenge is rewarded with a considerable deposit into his bank account. Not surprisingly, the challenges turn dark quickly, but once in, it isn't easy to get out. We follow our protagonist/antagonist as he faces his fears, evolves his personality, and tries to conquer challenges way outside his comfort zone, and outside the realm of law abiding citizens.13 Sins has it's creative moments, it's clumsy moments, and it's extremely awkward moments. Following the character through the gambit laid by the plot writers is frequently cringe-inducing, in a good, creepy way. It's horror, and it fully embraces the grisly material, forcing you along for the ride. The violent moments, unlike some horror, are emotionally gut-wrenching because they are so human and visceral.Plot pacing is good, but the plot has it's fair share of loose seams if not downright holes. The director wisely chose to play a good portion of the backstory close to the vest, thus allowing the mystery to cover the sins of the plot in many instances.Acting is usually quite good, with a few misses, but mostly descent performances from solid actors.Overall, I was happy with this one and would have preferred to see it in a theater."
" Not as good as these reviews make out.
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,3,It started off alright and intriguing until it turned into Weekend At Bernies. Its not a horror at all. It's a comedy.

" 13 Sins are better than 12
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,7,Surprisingly a good story with a kind of original plot.
" A little gore isnt a horror movie but its still worth the watch. SPOILERS GALORE HERE
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,7,"Descent enough story, but in the end its sorta a let down. How are you gona go through all of that just to throw away the money at the end? Literally could have been a millionaire with Nothing else changing, instead just kill another guy and lose the money. Doesnt make sense... dad and brother are dead for zero reason when you dont take the money... not like you ended the game by killing the cop at the end anyway, should have just shown him a millionaire going back to his fiance.."
" Not bad but

" Interesting, food for thoughts ... so Game on!
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,6,"It tried to be a little bit hardcore and it succeeded, while making the star turning 360 in his life! It wants to show you something about human behavior and it follows the same horror game! A little bit different and funnier than others. I recommend it for an entertaining night! Movie rolled really nice!"
" Garbage ending
",2019-11-07 00:00:00,6,"Would have reviewed much hire if the ending wasn't total trash. It's left, let's say unfinished, but not something they can do a sequel of and pull off. Could have had a full 10 stars if the ending at least completed the movie."
" 13 Sins (2014)
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,5,"Directed by Daniel Stamm. Starring Mark Webber, Devon Graye, Rutina Wesley, Ron Perlman, Tom Bower, Donny Boaz, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Lance E. Nichols, (voice) George Coe. (R)Hapless sap Webber receives a mysterious phone call, challenging him to complete thirteen tasks for increasing rewards; he agrees, little knowing how ominous and dangerous the charges will soon become. Part real world horror, part black comedy, the set-up may be derivative of several sources (and is, of course, entirely implausible), but has the potential for tightening suspense and macabre entertainment. Never as inventive as one would like, it still provides moments of grisly dread and some wicked chuckles, until it derails with far-fetched twists at the climax (at least one of which can be seen well in advance and at least one of which is really, really dumb). Webber finds the right notes of weakness and desperation, though even his character loses touch with reality by the final stretch. Remake of ""13 Beloved"" from Thailand.53/100"

" Incredibly idiotic twist on an actually interesting premise
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,3,"Some people here have never seen a movie it seems. How is this a brilliant movie?!
This is one of the ones you watch in its entirety because it's so provocatively bad. It does not only not make any sense in itself and is very inconsequential on top but literally everyone in it lacks any sort of common sense, too. It's very unsatisfying. I would not ever recommend it to anyone, although I do sometimes host a trash movie night where we watch infuriatingly bad films that make you scream at the screen what an actual, thinking person would do instead in complete disbelief. For that type of entertainment, it's a good contender, if that's your thing go ahead. 7/10 for ridiculing it, 3/10 as an actual movie and that's generous on both those numbers."
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,8,"Wow, very unexpected and intriguing premise. entertaining throughout. The story went in lots of crazy directions with memorable ideas. The tone was perfectly set with great music. good performances by the main character and his brother. lots of parts where i was able to feel the characters' emotions. (2 viewings)
SPOILERS
The spins were all great, and there were like 4. I knew something was up so I wasn't fully surprised but they still got me good. The first one was his brother being the second player. I was thinking it would be someone we've seen but I did not suspect him and it was a pretty good twist, especially when I remembered the part about the police looking into him for exposing himself to a girl. It was set up for viewers to assume it had to do with his mental health. The next twist was when their father revealed that he played the game when they were children, and the family member he killed was their mother, by purposely crashing into a light pole when he knew she never wore a seat belt. We heard earlier in the film about the car accident and suspecting the father was drunk. Also that the father became abusive after he became rich. The third twist was the cop being on their payroll and the investigation into the game being completely buried. I suspected that at one point, but began to trust him. And with all that had just happened in the climax, that twist still hit pretty hard. Finally, not really a twist, but the tease that the wife was now starting a new game gave me one last OMG moment. Even before all the twists I was considering giving it a 3.5, the twists just took it to a new level. On a side note, this film is very similar to Cheap Thrills in a lot of ways"
" Where's my tinfoil hat?
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,5,"""13 Sins"" plays off the much-used fictional plot device and real-life conspiracy stuff that a small shadowy group of humans is behind the scenes running the entire world, but the rest of us just don't know about it. We now have one of these much-vaunted ""Illuminati"" as our president, and it's blatantly clear that there are no brilliant ""evil geniuses"" behind the scenes carefully choreographing the worlds politics and economics. It's all really as stupid and disorganized as it appears. There isn't even a small man behind the curtain--it's only the wind. If you can live with this much-abused nonsense being at the heart of this film, then it really isn't that bad as a horror/thriller and certainly falls into the watchable range. I would have probably rated this movie as 6 instead of a 5, except that I couldn't stand seeing the average for this film being above the high 5 range. Once a film gets to 6 and above on average, it's almost always definitely good, and this film doesn't quite reach that level. Properly, this movie should be carrying a rating somewhere around 5.6-5.7, and I'm doing my best to bring it down to where it belongs."
" Morally interesting
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,8,"I liked it but it gives me serious wonder about my own moral compass. For the most part I decided I'd leave the wire up for the motorcyclers. They just annoyed me enough to not care about them. I also had no qualms about cutting off the arm of my school bully. Heck, I'd probably do it for free."

",2019-05-13 00:00:00,8,"Being that I've never heard of this movie when I saw it on Netflix I was skeptical because there's been a lot of real stinkers lately. However, right from the get-go this movie draws you in and doesn't let go until the end! Most movies have at least a few minutes where they let you catch your breath where they drag their feet but not this one!I didn't even recognize Mark Webber who I absolutely loved in Scott Pilgrim versus the world! They had him playing a real cuckold, pantywaist, whatever words you want to call it he never stands up for himself or his family, in fact when his boss tries to fire him, his boss flat out says that if you try to fight for your job I'll let you keep it but he just accepts the fact that he's getting fired and walks out the door! And this is all literally days before he and his pregnant fiancee are about to get married, and he's already supporting his mentally ill brother who he doesn't want to have to send back to a state institution where they lock him away in a room where he's bored and scared! And then he finds out that his dad can't take care of his house anymore so his dad wants to move in with them too! The whole world is falling on his shoulders right at this one moment in time the worst time of all! And he just walks away without standing up for himself! Then his phone rings! The man on the other line issues our protagonist challenges, and for every challenge money gets deposited into his checking account. But in order to win all the money and keep it, he has to complete all 13 challenges, and he has to do it without knowing what all 13 challenges are, and he cannot speak to anyone else about the game. Each challenge being worse than the last. They start out small like the first one was simply to swat a fly buzzing around inside his vehicle. That earned him $1,000, then the next one was to eat the fly which earn him enough to pay off his fiance's credit card! But from there on out the challenges began to affect other innocent people. And then fact they became illegal. He was told that if he completed all 13 challenges that all of his illegal activities would be washed away and he would be a free man. Now I have to be real careful because if you follow my reviews at all I am one who does not like to give away spoilers I like to tiptoe around it but I don't want to ruin anything for anyone. And I don't like to give enough clues that people can figure things out. But every time his phone or a phone nearby rings and it's big top music like at a circus, he knows it's the game master calling him. The movie was incredible, I have been getting really tired of the typical slasher Gore film with Gore simply for the purpose of Gore, with no meaning or Direction behind it, and no originality at all, and while this movie could be compared to being similar just something like Truth or Dare because he's being directed what to do by someone else, by and large it's completely different from those movies because he's playing a game and he has the choice to stop playing at any time but there's consequences for that action. And there's many other things involved that make it completely different which I can't get into without creating a spoiler. You're just going to have to take my word for it.Before I ruin things for anyone, I'm going to step into my pros and cons here. On the positive, the cast was amazing! I totally love the fact that they had a multiracial couple that was so easy together and they didn't make a big deal out of it and they seem so happy! The script was great there were so many twists and turns that you did not see coming it kept me on the edge of my seat with my nails ripped right into the cushion! Cinematography was spot-on! I just can't say enough good stuff about it! As for the cons, I think the guy who played the dad was unbelievable. He was just reading his part and not trying to act. I wish they'd used Ron Perlman more. I think there could have been some major character development there at the very end I was confused at what they were trying to tell me about him. I had to go back and re-watch the ending for several reasons but he was one of them. And that's why I'm Mark this as low as I did, the ending was just really confusing.I highly recommend watching this movie, if you like horror movies this is for you. If you like Thrillers this is for you. If you like to be intellectually stimulated by a movie this is for you. If you like to just go and be entertained for an hour and a half-ish, this is for you! I hope it was thorough and I hope it can help you and your decision watching enjoy!"
" The Game
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,5,"13 Sins is an effective horror thriller which ties itself in absurdities and also telegraphs its twists a little too much.Elliot Brindle (Mark Webber) is salesman who gets fired for not being mean enough. Now without a job he is in debt, he needs to support his mentally handicapped brother, as well as his father who is in a old people's home and he is about to get married.In a bleak predicament, Elliot gets a phone call asking him to complete some challenge for which he will get some easy money. The first one is easy, swat a fly and cash is deposited in his account.When Elliot agrees to do more challenges, they get more perverse, dangerous and Elliot can make more millions.Now Elliot is a driven man, there is a cop on his tail and there might be other people doing something similar. A fly in the ointment one might say.13 Sins is a remake of a Thai film. It mixes horror with black humour. I was surprised that Elliot was not initially more sceptical with the jovial man on the phone and wondered about the all seeing eye that always watched Elliot.The latter part of the film is just ludicrous yet it is enjoyable enough."
" That's what you get for answering your phone.
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,7,"330. 13 Sins. Meet Elliot, he's broke, he has to pay for his brother's medical care, dad might have to move in with him, cause he's broke too. But there's a bright side!! He's about to get married and has a big meeting with the boss tomorrow, looks the top salesman is going to get promoted... or could he be getting fired? Yep, that's it. But when one door closes another opens, or a phone call, as is the case here. Elliot receives a mysterious call from what seems to be game show, the caller asks if he wants to try it, and desperate Elliot goes for it. First challenge: Swat the fly that's buzzing around in his car for some cash... how'd they know about the fly??? Second challenge: Eat the fly for some more cash. And as you may have guessed, it just keeps getting worse, or better, depending how you look at it. Make it through 13 challenges, walk away with a ton of cash and no repercussions for your actions, refuse the challenge and well, quite the opposite is true. Pretty sweet paranoid thriller type flick, especially cause they're watching you right now. Filmbufftim on FB."
" This movie screwed me up
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,10,"It's a great movie. It really is. As the tasks started out, I started to feel anxious. By task 6 I was really anxious. After that, things started to get kind of rough for me. But I powered through. I did not see the end coming, and I dont think you will either. Highly recommend this movie if you like psychological thrillers. Maybe don't watch it if you have a sensitive constitution though."
" This movie was amazing. Finally great script writing.
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,10,"Right from the opening scene this movie gets your attention and the writing is freaking amazing. It's a classic plot formula of the protagonist getting in deeper and deeper known as the quicksand approach. There was even a movie a long time ago called quicksand that used this. The game show's host voice and attitude and delivery was dead on, hilarious, and yet believable. His sarcastic dialogue was just genius. I loved it from beginning to end and I wish it had never ended. I just added it to my list of classics. A must see movie."
" it does not look like horror
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,3,"Some plot holes not worth watching in my opinion! Cheap Thrills. Dumbest ending ever!!! He did all that just to lose it all in the end? why he playing in the first place?? Maybe I'm confuse, is he going to jail or not? I know he got himself disqualified by killing the cop which was stupid on his part. Now he can't even afford counseling to deal with the trauma. Killing the cop wasn't going to bring his family back, besides they basically killed themselves. I thought ending could have been WAY, WAY better."
" Original, exciting and well made.
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,8,"I was reasonably entertained with this horror slash psychological thriller, it's story is original, it has a good pace and there's a fair amount of convincingly staged gore. The script provides some nice twists and turns and thanks to the mounting bizarreness of the tasks main character Elliot has to fulfill to earn his financial rewards it remains involving and exciting up until the end. Mark Webber may not be the most charismatic actor you can imagine, but here this inconspicuousness pays off: he's just a regular guy like you and me and we are forced to wonder is we would have acted the same as he, lured of course by the promise of easy money.
All in all a well made, original movie, I rank it 8 out of 10."
" Don't Waste Your Time
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,2,It's one of those dare movies - not scary - just gross and really stupid. Don't waste your time on this.
" Watch it for yourself
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,8,"I was really surprised by this film, watched it on Netflix. Watch this movie for your self, it's a great movie that keeps you hinged on till the end. Worth seeing it."
" That last one of the ""13 Sins"" is a real humdinger
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,6,"You will likely join me in finding the premise of the subversive game show cum horror thriller ""13 Sins"" to be patently preposterous. But it's a movie, man. So I let myself go with the freaky flow. And I was reasonably rewarded with a solidly acted (more Ron Perlman), consistently engrossing (emphasis on GROSS) story of a guy who finds he'll do anything for a buck. Well, damn near, anyway.The final scene of ""13 Sins"" follows a particularly heinous ""ultimate challenge"". The moment didn't retread the route that most flicks of this ilk choose to go down. An unexpected upbeat conclusion delivers a welcome surprise, capping off a brutally bumpy ride."
" Loved it up until the ending
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,7,"Spoilers!
He just ended up with nothing and still killed his family. Dumb. Take the money and run. All in all, pretty decent movie."
" Not for me, but not a bad film
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,6,"I mostly clicked into this one because of Ron Perlman, despite knowing this premise isn't my jam. And on that front, I was correct. It was a well-acted and nicely produced film, though, and definitely worth a watch for those who aren't terribly bored of the ""white guy forced to do bad things"" trope."

" Probably could have been better, but makes for a pretty decent night of entertainment
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,8,"The movie is interesting and makes you wonder what you would do if you had the opportunity to complete some kind of immediate task and see money pop up in your bank account. The catch, of course, being....the more money at stake the more unbelievably immoral and brutal the tasks become.
When you realize that there is a lot more people playing this 'game' things get a little muddled. You realize from the beginning of the movie, if you pay attention to the credits, that it's been going on for a long time. Though it's never really explained who, or what, is behind it. The guy that tell's Ron's character about how 1% of 1% of the people in the world make the decisions and then they must just get 'bored', that statement makes you, or at least it made me, want to hear a much more detailed explanation.
Anyhow, it's original and does show a very dark side of humanity that asks a spine-tingling question...just how many throats will someone cut and how many innocent bodies are they willing to leave in their wake to make sure they are taking care of themselves and family?
One problem I had was that there were times that the 'voice' on the phone was kinda muddled, talking too fast, or just hard to understand. So, you couldn't tell what the next challenge was until it played out. I suppose that if you were in a theatre with surround sound and all of that, that probably wouldn't have been a problem.
But overall, a thumbs up....pretty good acting by the main character and even though the special effects aren't the 'Avengers' or 'Lord of the Rings', they're serviceable. So grab you a plate of chocolate chip cookies, sit down with the fam and enjoy."
" Who's Pulling The Strings
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,7,"This was a decent thriller even if it was a bit predictable. A young man on the verge of being married, expecting a baby, caring for his mentally disabled brother, dealing with a less than likeable father, deep in debt and recently fired is given the opportunity to play a game consisting of 13 challenges. The challenges begin fairly easy but each new challenge escalates greatly and carry greater risks. If he quits or tells anyone about the game he is disqualified and all winnings up to that point are lost as well. The questions he faces come down to how far is willing to go for the money and his freedom.Like I said, this was decent enough. You feel for the guy and his situation. There was a building of suspense throughout the film and that is on of it's most enjoyable aspects. Some of the challenges are a bit out there but there was a good effort to keep things flowing in what felt like the range of possibility. i saw some of the ending coming but there were other aspects in how it ended that caught me off guard. That was something I liked. There were questions left unanswered which could maybe be an open door to a sequel and that would be fine. However, without a sequel, I missed not being able to know more about the game. All-in-all it was an enjoyable film."
" 13 is VERY UNLUCKY
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,10,"I really enjoyed this movie. How idea of playing a ""game"" to win $$ is normal, right? WRONG, WRONG, WRONG!!!What begins as a seemingly fraternity-like challenge of eating a fly slowly escalates. As Elliott becomes more and more engrossed with getting paid, he loses his moral self, and starts doing more and more erratic spontaneous acts to cover up for what he was initially required to do. Child abuse, desecrating a corpse, urinating on the food/destroying his own marriage rehearsal dinner, all lead up to the Grand Finale/Winning Prize...but....to collect any/all he must complete the last of the 13 challenge of...you guessed it...MURDER. And not just any ole body....a FAMILY MEMBER must die...!I thought it was going to be his fiance, beautiful Rutina Wesley, who woulg get targeted, but turns out his mentally challenged brother was not so mentally challenged after all. The street scene with the bike riders getting massacred by driving through an unseen steel cable that little bro rests after Elliott releases it attests to that! And my boy Ron Perlman was delivering his usual swag as always!If you like gore, check this one out, you won't be disappointed."
" Crazy and unic at the same time.
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,7,"I was not surprised when I saw that this movie was kind of a remake from an Asian movie that was released in 2006. Only Japanese horror movies can get as gore as this. I liked the idea a lot, when everything is falling apart, you will take whatever is put in front of you. The ending was special with a very good plot twist like a cherry on the top. The gore scenes were pretty well made, altho there were some flaws with the police acting like the police in GTA, as stupid as it can be, but still, a pretty good movie. Scary and entertanining. 7/10"
" intriguing concept needs a name lead
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,6,"A voice on the phone takes people on a life and death ride for cash prizes. Elliot Brindle is a meek nice-guy salesman expecting a promotion but gets fired instead. He cares for his mentally handicapped brother Michael. He's in debt and his girlfriend Shelby is pregnant. He's forced to take in his angry racist father who is getting evicted. He gets a phone call claiming that he's on a hidden camera show. The voice tells him that he could win prizes for completing 13 challenges. At first, the tasks are relatively easy and the money is real. Soon, manipulations force him to continue the dangerous game and any failure would take away the money already won. Police detective Chilcoat (Ron Perlman) takes on the seemingly random series of petty crimes by the same man.This is a Blumhouse production and a remake of a Thai horror. It needs a bigger name in the Elliot lead. Also, Elliot is too deliberately oblivious. With the threat to take away his money, he should play it safe by taking out the cash and closing his account. Of course, the voice can come back by upping his credit card charges. At least, he needs to show the brains to try to resist. It's an intriguing high concept idea but little nagging issues do persist. It's not really about the 13 challenges but rather a changing personality. In that sense, I do see the concept bearing some fruits."
" Fun Little Gore-Game Film.
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,5,"A man down on his luck finds a telephone in his car. It rings. They offer him a deal. Kill a fly for $1000.And when he does, he goes home to check his bank account. It's there. So he does the next challenge. He eats the fly for just over $3500.Now he's told he's been chosen for a game. And that he will be required to fulfill 13 tasks, for which he will be compensated in ever greater quantities, the further he goes.Things get a little out of hand too...he sets a church on fire, gets arrested, breaks out of jail, shooting a cop in the process...among other things...Eventually, he finds out, he's in this game against another player...and only one can win the millions at stake.But things get too real for him, and he decides to quit...while trying to stop the other player from going any further.But it's the last challenge...and the very well might be up against each other.There are a couple twists thrown in there...some work well...some kind of unnecessary.But it's an entertaining film all around- with lot's of gore and some dark humour to top it off.Certainly worth a watch.5.5 out of 10."
" Neither Lame or Good
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,6,"In summary, this film is not much different than an extended episode of the 'Twilight Zone' with a bit more gore thrown in for good measure. The only real annoyance was the irritating voice of the controller behind the machinations and the fact you couldn't really make out what was being displayed on Elliot's phone.The film pulls you along albeit gently, that said, in the end this sort of sits between predictable and entertaining hence the 6/10 rating. Ron Pearlman must have needed the money to pay his taxes-what a waste."
" Absolutely brilliant!
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,9,"Twisted, demented, and sick on a level that bothered even a ghoul, like me. Psychological horror at its best...and by horror, I don't mean gore or anything like that (though there is a little bit) the horror is purely primal.It is absolutely ghastly to think that someone could be so desperate that they would even contemplate the actions perpetrated in this film.That, alone, is what makes it so upsetting.Never put anything past someone who's been pushed too far. You might find yourself surprised (and not in a good way) of what they're capable of. Highly, highly recommended!!!!"
" Interesting psychological thriller
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,8,"I really liked this film for a few reasons. The constant escalation is fantastic. The clever script is so good I couldn't poke any holes in the logic. The psychology involved and the chain of events chosen to move the story along were completely believable.The way the Puppet-Master laid the trap was quite brilliant. Finding a desperate man. The no-risk easy money. The initial threat of losing the winnings to prevent the contestant from dropping out. The willingness of the contestant to step outside their behavioral norms. Taking away the contestants free-will as they are forced to continue on despite knowing the repercussions of their actions.The unlimited resources of the ultra-rich, ultra-powerful, (ultra- borer?) Game Watchers have a god-like presence throughout the movie. At first I guessed it must be the Devil. Some might argue it is.The paranoid guy was probably not necessary but the scenes did add to the story. Nice twists at the end with, dad, brother, wife and the cop.A really good, low-budget film."
" Better than I thought it would be. Worth Watching.
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,8,"This is a really interesting film that asks the question, what will you do for money? Kill a fly for a thousand dollars? Eat the dead fly to cover your fiancé's debts?This is the quandary that our anti-hero, Elliott Brindle (portrayed amiably by Mark Webber), has to face when his phone rings one night while he's out for a drive. The voice on the other end of the line is both eloquent, haunting, and scary in equal measures (voiced brilliantly by George Coe and sounding a lot like Angus Scrimm from Phantasm - I just wanted him to say, ""BOY!""), seems to know everything about Elliott's life and circumstances... he's lost his job... his mentally handicapped brother will have to go back into care... his racist father has to leave his assisted living residence, to move in with his son and his coloured fiancé,The voice assures him that in thirty-two hours he could have enough money to make all his problems disappear.What would you do? Elliott accepts the thirteen challenges and as the hour's progress the trials get progressively nastier and deadlier.Daniel Stamm who directed the film and along with David Birke wrote the screenplay does a good job of pacing the film through a roller-coaster ride of ups and downs, building a nice tension. I knew the twist was coming at the end, though the writers do a good job of giving you a few possible outcomes to try and keep you off balance.The film's strength and enjoyability is helped by having three strong actors in the cast; Ron Perlman (Detective Chilcoat), Pruitt Taylor Vince (Vogler), and Tom Bower (Elliot's Father). Even Devon Graye playing the handicapped Michael Brindle does a decent portrayal, which I didn't find too disagreeable at all.Even though this is primarily a thriller the vagueness and unknown origin of the voice and it's all-encompassing knowledge, along with the conspiracy theory of pure evil adds a possible supernatural / religious angle to the story. Those parts of the story along with the style of direction and building of tension and fear make this a Horror film too.I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would have as this type of story has the probability to be full of clichés and familiar scenes. However, even though some of the clichés and scene's are there the acting and direction make them seem fresh. There have been reviews stating that the ending is an anticlimax and flat. Though I like the ending as it resembles reality.If you like this style of film and story then give this a try and you shouldn't be too disappointed. But if this is on and your car has broken down so you can't visit friends and family, then give this a look, you may enjoy it."
" Not as good as the original, but not the worst remake out there
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,5,"13 SINS is the American remake of the Thai horror film 13: GAME OF DEATH, which is well worth watching for anyone interested in the subject matter. It goes without saying that this remake is by far the inferior movie, although those who haven't seen the original might enjoy it regardless. The story is about a down-on-his-luck guy, struggling financially, who finds himself tasked with performing a series of tasks in return for money.The stakes start off low but gradually build to more and more extreme situations. The budget for the film is low but the events staged are quite convincing, although it's unfortunate that some of the better tasks from the Thai original are skipped over. The main actor isn't particularly good but Ron Perlman is effective as the dogged cop investigating the case. The usual gamut of shocking scenes, bad taste moments, and gore are enough to keep this little story watchable."
