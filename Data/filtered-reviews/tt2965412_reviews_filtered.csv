" Witty, funny and touching
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,8,"One of the best romance films I've seen, there's moments when it's just goofy and funny but there is always this tension because you are not actually sure what will happen next.
It kind of reminded me of Eternal Sunshine of the Spottless mind. Not like it was a copy, it just had the same vibe.I hesitated to watch this film for a long time because I didn't know what to expect, the trailer and all didn't give me that much info, but I am SO glad I did watch it"
" Charlie Kaufman meets Woody Allen
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,9,"I'm surprised how'd I miss this film? Maybe because I'm not a fan of romantic dramas. I watched it because I saw it in Sam Esmail's filmography, a huge fan of his work (Mr. Robot of course!).Real conversations like in Woody Allen's films with Kaufmanisque mystery, made it a perfect watch. Not taking anything away from Sam Esmail, the comparison is only to give you an idea what a treat is this film to watch. Where you're constantly on the edge of the seat rooting for their union, unsure about the fate of their relationship.
Both the actors had a great chemistry. Brilliant screenplay and cinematography, and great score. Watch and recommend it to you friends, even to those - in fact especially to those - who're not into romantic dramas."
" Where is my feakin money ?
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,8,"When you love someone you don't give up, but that's not the case here. Here it's all about destiny, the signs and the universe and it is up to you to believe it or not. This movies, otherwise an acid trip through a never changing argument of what could be and what should be is a decade long feud that is very good storyline for indie drama writers.
Just felt a little that though this was a complete romance but it still felt one sided as dell was trying to test destiny whereas the Kim was hardwired to be superficial love that feels good and comforting but true love is never comforting it is rough and it's got thorns and it is ugly.
I realised that you don't change through time but become more of what you really are. So dell never stop loving Kim but his love kept growing and was the death of him. I funny how you commit to an idea and let make yourself believe in things you never believed. I want to be Dell. He is not afraid to go back and not afraid to start a conversation because he got nothing to lose. He is a gambler, of destiny and fate and he has yet to realise how to make best of his ability, which is to talk his way into every relationship but also talk his way out of it. Dell is a perfect imperfect character that revolves around love."
" I Slipped
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,10,"Every scene made me watch it with a smile.. that made me taste salt.
"" its an addiction, a Bio-chemical reaction "".This movie is a pillow under a gun point"
" You just have to take this movie as it is.
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,10,"You just have to take this movie as it is. There's no beginning, middle, and end. It was aptly describe in it as ""like a painting"", just look at the canvass at your own leisure without the formula of time. You wouldn't know where the climax is, you wouldn't know when should you be happy or sad since you can't predict what will happen for the next 5 minutes. You are deprived of your sense of time which makes it ethereally beautiful. So the best way to enjoy this film is to not try to presuppose any aspect of the story, enjoy each ""now"" moments, and submit yourself devoid of time. Hands down. 10/10"
" Amazing score, relatable characters, something new every time I watch
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,9,"While watching this for a first time, I was kinda confused, although I did love the score and cinematography. What I really thought was amazing was the two leads, Rossum and Long, the writing was innovative and is just a great modern love story everyone should check out"
" Get over it.
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,4,"Neither actor acted; they delivered snappily written lines in the most predictable manner possible.
Emmy, unfortunately, has worked too long with the same people in the same role. It's not surprising that she was not challenged to break out of her mold by the director, most notably because she is his wife.
The concept is excellent, but the deliverance was pedestrian; in the hands of better actors, it could very well have been a classic."
" A breakup story
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,7,"Comet is about any breakup story, just as we all have gone through, which alway contains memories and fantasies, that in the case of Comet this fantasies are defined as parallel universes
Be ready to be confused, spend time reflecting and you will understand that this story is or was your breakup story"
" Different
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,6,Very different and unique. didnt follow the storyline entirely nor did i connect with the characters or really understand the premise but was still entertained and thought that it was original and thought provoking. kudos weird movie.
" Pretentious movie with unlikable characters
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,3,"One of the most pretentious movies I have ever watched. The main guy character is an unlikable, self-important asshat right from the start, in a way that should be obvious to everybody - except, apparently, the main girl character. She likes it, goes right along with his ""I'm the smartest man alive"" schtick, and delivers some crazy chick attitude in return. The writers worked hard to make narcissistic, sociopathic character traits appear quirky and cute. They're not. They're narcissistic and sociopathic. Couple that with clumsy exposition, wooden dialogue, and wannabe ""aha!"" moments, and it all turns into a major trainwreck. I'm guessing the actors did the best with what they were given to work with. However, the result should appear highly unlikable to any human being with a shred of actual empathy. Comet is a movie that looks good on paper, but unfortunately, does not deliver on its promise at all. Unless we're supposed to find these two painfully annoying, in which case, congratulations."
" A mess.
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,1,"""Kind of"" funny, but dear god the plot. What a disaster. Couldn't watch it all the way through."
" my notes
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,6,"Good movie with a nice story told in an interesting way. there were a lot of very creative scenes. visually stimulating (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
Theory #1 - Dell in our universe is having weird dreams which are actually memories from his parallel universe. In our universe he doesn't end up with her but in the movie Universe he does and it helps him cope with losing her. A clue is that she was lying about being pregnant and was about to confess before he stopped her and figured it out. And he couldn't read anything in the black book, her thesis. At first I thought it meant he can't really understand her or something along those lines but apparently you can't read in dreams
Theory #2 - they really don't end up together in the movie timeline but the two suns in the background mean that is the alternate universe and in our universe they are togetherthe girl as a characters wasn't very likable. but I guess the point is that she was supposed to be a little messed up and not perfectI was very close to disliking this movie before that final scene. I was worried it was going to be one of those where you really have no idea what happened at all. But the last scene did a good job of making you understand the different possibilities. if this movie ended before that last scene it would have been completely ambiguous with infinite possibilities. But that last scene kind of narrowed it down a lotFrom chat discussion with Ronnie: That's a great comparison. In neon demon you can literally come up with anything and it might be true. And most of your analysis will just be about metaphors and symbolism. In this movie there are definitive possibilities for exactly what happened in the movie"
" Is this legal?
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,2,"Assume this movie is set in other universes because Woody Allen has the patent for this kind of stuff in this universe.Assuming also that all involved were adequately paid for their trouble, I am giving myself two points for actually watching this (almost) all the way through - in the hope that a flash of talent or the like might save it. Being different is not the same as being original: surely that is inscribed over the entrance to every movie school in all universes."
" Great movie for a one time viewing or multiple
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,9,While it is confusing at times. Seeing how close a relationship can flourish or diminish within multiple timelines is what makes this movie good. But the cinematography and the music is what makes it great. It's a passion project that does what intends to bring passion to the screen
" underrated gem
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,10,"I don't really feel like saying anything about this movie other than that i think it is greatly, gracelessly, painfully underrated. please do yourself a favor and watch it. i know it sounds tacky as hell, but it's not just a movie; it's an experience. it wrenches the heart, it touches the soul, it provokes thought and it lingers on in your mind like a pleasant dream. just watch it."
" Unconventional Love Story
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,8,"A uniquely presented, hypo-manic love story with intriguing truisms and insights throughout, that is both entertaining and thought provoking. The constant patter, chemistry and performances of the leads literally is the story. Practically no other characters intrude, and none distract. The production and direction fit perfectly and the editing effectively supports the jumps backward and forward in time.Having said all that, what impressed me the most was the acting. Over the past couple of years I've become interested in the differences between good and bad acting and actors. While both actors were very good here, I found Emily Rossum's performance to be stunning. She made her character so real that I forgot it wasn't, yet it also popped. That's a mark of excellence I've sought. I've read review after review of other performances claiming that various actors disappeared into their characters, but rarely found that to be true. I usually know the actor is doing the work, and hardly ever forget it. Emily actually does completely disappear into her role here. It makes me regret not watching Shameless all these years."
" Relatable
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,7,"Beautiful movie! Wonderful aesthetic, interesting story that makes you think about love, Universe and life in general."
" Deeply moving
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,10,"The script is over-whitty sometimes. That's my only complaint.
The story is about an on and off relationship that lasted for 6 years in anachronical order. It's very, very beautiful and deeply moving and I have never written a review for a movie but I wanted to write one for this movie because it's very beautiful and amazing."
" very amazing movie...
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,10,"""sane people"" may not like very much.... but weird ones will love it..
a lot of conversations, theories and ideas that are not as the usual. really loved it so much, even beyond description"
" Perfect drama movie.. get ready to Cry!
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,10,"Love this movie, definitely made me cry. Because the acting was perfect, I loved the writing of a real life love story & the way they edited to jump back & forth between memories. Very Trippy & unique if your looking for a good drama movie this is it! I felt that it demonstrated a real relationship that everyone has dealt with. It was raw & honest"
" so-so, but ultimately not worth it
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,4,"I liked some of the camera work, but it got tiresome. The conceit of mixing up time was fine, so that wasn't the problem. The whole thing was just a little too self-consciously precious. I definitely did not like either Justin Long or the character he played, so that killed most of the romance for me. I adore Emmy Rossum, but ultimately this film wasn't worth 90 minutes of my life."
" Necessary to make him believe in love
",2017-11-16 00:00:00,9,"I wonder if Jack even existed. Since Dell wanted her to lie to him in his most vulnerable state it was necessary for her to create this big lie about Jack and her being pregnant to make him believe in love and save their future together. She made up the lie in the car on the way to the shooting range, but before she could tell the truth he broke up with her, saying he didn't love her, wondering if he ever did. Don't think she saw any reason to tell about the lie at that time. Time after that she had to stick to the story to have a chance to win him back. To make him realize."
" Cringy execution, pleasant content, overall: skippable.
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,6,"For starters, I was let down 15min into the movie because I found out that the main actor wasn't Keanu Reeves (ok, maybe that's just an emotional argument). Before that, I was wondering why Reeves' character wasn't as good as I expected from him and how he could've fallen into such a lame role.But continuing with the rest of the movie: Photography sucks, everything is on the two bottom thirds of the screen, almost out of frame, which is terribly irritating. They were trying to be artsy, but it wasn't well executed (unlike ""Her"", which's Photography is also artsy, ""hipster"", but successfully centers on the appreciation of ""the aesthetic""). Some effects were quite fake. Most of the effects were acceptable because that can happen when you lack a large budget or strong CGI tools, however, at some moments I don't know if they were going for ""magical""? but it stopped at tacky, like it was edited by a 10-year-old. I saw it as unprofessional. User ""Jody Bruchon"" covers my points pretty well: ""A story should work BECAUSE of the camera work, not IN SPITE of it.""Acting and script are unnatural as well: Transitions between ideas in the conversations are totally unnatural and fake. Half of the time Justin Long's acting was —as user ""Grasswerks"" states it— ""garbage"", and Emmy Rossum's was ""as cute as her face = barely."" Hard to enjoy the potential and ideas of the movie when you're cringing because of all of these things.But there are also good things this work: I like some dialogues, the concepts behind it are very well stated, quotable, which is the reason this movie is saved from being reviewed less than 5 stars. The plot and concept of it being ""like a painting, without a beginning or an end"" are pleasant. I don't think the ending should be taken that seriously, else you're stuck with that unsatisfying ""what type of ambiguity is this?"" I didn't have a problem with it and even thought the last 20 min were the most enjoyable of the whole piece.It's a good movie to watch when you have some spare time and you're doing something parallel to watching it (i.e. it doesn't need your full attention; unless you want to suffer from the photography and acting)."
" Underrated film that DESERVES your attention
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,7,"This film is so beautiful and absolutely brilliant. It tells the story of Dell and Kimberly thought a 6- year relationship and across a few different parallel universes. The film sounds strange but it is so good. The cinematography is gorgeous and has a very unique color pallet. Justin Long and Emmy Rossum are both nothing short of fantastic and the chemistry is just fantastic. Unlike most romantic comedies (i.e. The Proposal, The Notebook, etc) the dialogue and situations feel natural where as in the before mentioned films, they feel completely forced. Sam Esmail is a genius. With this and Mr Robot, I have high expectations for him in the future. With only a 43% on Rotten Tomatoes, I feel this is one of the few times where I disagree with most critics. This could easily be the best film of 2014 or possibly even the whole decade. Don't just read the reviews and think you won't like it. Just give it a chance. It only makes sense for me to give it a perfect 10/10."
" Night of the Comet.
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,7,"Catching up on some DVD viewings,I decided to see what films were about to be removed from Netflix UK. Not having seen her since the double bill of The Day After Tomorrow and The Phantom of the Opera in 2004, (despite being based on a UK show,Shameless has never come out on UK DVD) I was intrigued to spot an indie flick with Emmy Rossum,which led to me looking up at the sky.The plot:Crashing into each other whilst standing in line to watch a meteor shower,Dell and Kimberly collide into a romantic relationship.Over their six years,Dell wonders about what state the romance must be in alternative universes.Unknown to (this version of) Dell,the other Dell's and Kimberly's are seeing their love burnout across the galaxy.View on the film:Experiencing anything but a crumbling relationship behind the scenes, (she would later get married to the writer/director) Emmy Rossum gives an excellent,fragile performance as Kimberly. Initially whirling in with a kooky smile,Rossum pulls it into a fraught state,where the mere sight of Dell makes Kimberly fall more out of love with him. Tripping over his sweet nothings to Kimberly,Justin Long gives a great performance as Dell,who Long keeps from ever feeling he is on stable ground,which pulls his love for Kimberly into an unstable state.Programmed before he created the TV series Mr. Robot,the debut screenplay by writer/director Sam Esmail scatters a snapshot across the screen on the various eras of Dell's and Kimberly's relationship criss-crossing over each other,from the lightly comedic first encounter,to the emotionally raw,bitter downward spiral the romance becomes trapped in. Although the use of parallel universes keeps the romance unsettled,Esmail disappointingly does not use it to give the characters a complexity or depth,but to instead use it as a device to jump back and forth on the various stages of the romance. Inspired by the Cinéma Du Look movement,debuting director Esmail & cinematographer Eric Koretz crack the night sky of Dell and Kimberly's blossoming stage with a wave of ultra-stylised neon reds,blues and yellows,that shimming as Esmail dips from the real to the parallel. Tripping the colours as Dell and Kimberly's romance hits new lows,Esmail keeps the Du Look styling simmering in a warm light blue darting across Dell and Kimberly's romance like a comet."
" Poetic and mesmerizing
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,8,"I absolutely adored this movie and I am only not giving it a perfect score because of the ambiguous ending. I had no trouble following the pace and flashing forward and backward in the character's mind. This may be a little confusing and irritating to some people though. The framing reminded me very much of the movie Closer. I think this movie Comet would best be suited for artistic, creative people and hopeless romantics.I found the dialogue to be very real and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. The two main characters have amazing chemistry together and I didn't even realize until someone else pointed it out in their review that they are pretty much the only people in the entire movie.The scenery was absolutely beautiful and very inspiring. I think Kimberly was more wacky like Dell than she chose to believe. I think they were both very strange, offbeat characters and that is why they fit so well together but also why they tend to clash. The acting was absolutely amazing, definitely Justin Long's greatest performance.I personally would like to believe in the optimistic ending which is that ""being pregnant and not leaving Jack"" is Kimberly's lie which she had never gotten to tell throughout their relationship. Dell had specifically told her the night that they met that she needed to choose the moment of her lie for a time when he was least expecting it and for when he was in A TRULY VULNERABLE STATE. So when he kisses her in the end and interrupts her, I think she was definitely about to tell him that was her lie and she finally fooled him. That is what I believe because I too do not want to live in a world where Kimberly and Dell do not end up together!"
" A must-see
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,10,"Just finished viewing this movie... All I have to say is that it was beautifully created. There are rarely any films that leave me speechless, and this was definitely one of them. The story line was so realistic, although it is obviously unreal.. it's very hard to describe. Most movies portray what we want to see.. what we wish could happen. That's not the case with this movie. There's not much else I can say without spoiling it... But this is definitely one of my favorite movies now, and I think that everyone should watch it. I have to keep writing because unfortunately IMDb requires 10 lines of text for a review, but I've already said what I had to say. Just see it!"
" A Phenomenal Take on Romance
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,8,"Comet is unlike the majority of romantic/drama movies that are out there. The movie is about a man and a woman in a relationship that bounces back and forth between the highs and lows. The movie is more of a collection of memories that bounce between the 6-year relationship of the couple. The film was shot beautifully and truly captures the tone of each scene and the emotions that are supposed to be felt. The movie was almost presented as a puzzle. You have to pay attention and make sure to fit all of the pieces together. This is what makes it significantly different than most romantic movies, and definitely is a reason that it was such a great movie. The chemistry between the two lead stars, Justin Long and Emmy Rossum, is outstanding.A must watch."
" Dead give away how did you miss this?
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,6,"It's too easy to dismiss something as artsy and hipster simply because it's use of relevant cultural appeal. It's just as easy to imprint depth on to a shallow canvas when you have the insight. So I don't really have a review except it seems like everyone tried their best. I personally did not find the non-linear time line difficult to follow. The open ending could be great if you like to fill in the blanks and choose your own adventure. Obviously there is plenty of room to toy intellectually with the ideas, even though it seemed to be executed with a great deal of slack (maybe this is why people are getting offended and calling is pseudo art - I don't know). What I really wanted to say is: She was hoping for a daughter. But she's actually having twin sons."
