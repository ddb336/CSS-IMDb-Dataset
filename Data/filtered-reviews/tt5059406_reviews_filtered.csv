" Horrifyingly Pointless Film
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,3,"This film had no story and no plot. And what does happen has little to no reason or explanation given.Who murdered Polly? Why was she playing hide and seek, was subsequently murdered, and didn't seem to give much of a damn or tried to run away? Why is she after Lily?After one sighting of the ghost, Lily screams herself to death? That's it? That's how she goes? I realize they set her character up as this easily frightened person, but really, she drops dead after one ghost sighting?Why is everyone in this movie incapable of moving or reacting at a normal pace? It literally takes the main character almost five minutes of screen time to NOT answer the door. That's right. The doorbell rings and it takes her almost five minutes to descend half the stairs and look out the window. And this was one of the final scenes of the movie.I'm all for gothic storytelling and slow-burn ghost stories, but this was neither. This was just the barest idea stretched into a 90-minute feature film."
" Very slow and sleep inducing
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,1,If you're having trouble at night sleeping then watch it... this is so slow that made me sleepy on a sunny afternoon ... lol
" I wish they finished writing the story
",2021-02-16 00:00:00,1,The worst thing about this movie is realising you are already half way through and that nothing is going to happen. However the best thing about this movie is when it finishes.
" 2
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,2,"Sorry, but this was not just bad but hideous. I get that creators/directors tried to show how original,quirky and bohemian this movie is but it was just a cheap kitsch. If you're trying to create ""smart"" movie you've to put more details,have strong characters and follow plot line. In this case, we're having bad beginning with weak leading role and no detailed movie at all. As a consumer I want to get information fast and understand what this movie is talking about in this film I was lost almost full 90minutes. I didn't like anything of this movie, it didn't have anything unique. I can just applause for creators that managed to make useless movie for under 10k$ budget. I would never recommend to watch this film, just don't waste your time and life."
" Really atmospheric
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,8,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I started watching this. I was more than a little hesitant at the fact that it was a haunted house movie, as the horror genre has been putting out absolute dreck in that department for quite a long time.I just wished that I had checked it out sooner.I do confess to being a Ruth Wilson fan, and I thought she was excellent in this, since she pretty much has to carry the whole thing on her own, with only minimal interactions.The plot is rather straightforward, a hospice nurse comes to care for an elderly authoress, that is presumably dying. The patient was once a famous horror writer, whose works might be more true than at first realized.I really do not want to go into too much detail as it would give away much of the film.Granted, it IS a slow moving film, but to me, the creepy haunted atmosphere, the unnerving music, the disturbing scenery, was more than efficient enough to keep my eyes glued to the screen the entire time. It is however, a film that does not provide neat little explanations (which I believe adds more to the creepy element). In the style of brilliant writer H.R. James, much of what takes place, is left open to interpretation, which only makes it all the more unsettling.If you really like atmospheric spooky horror, then I think you would like this one. There is not any blood, gore, cheap jump scares, and other tropes that the industry has done to death. I just wish more horror movies would take this road."
" Boring and predictable
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,4,This would have been better staying in a book... narrated all the way through I didn't see the point and every vital moment was predicted... to the very end.
" Boring
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,3,Blackcoats daughter was an excellent movie but this was so boring. Turn the volume up for lots of whispering!!
" A masterpiece
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,10,"One of the greatest and most beautiful movies I've seen in years.
Lots of care have been taken regarding the cinematography, the frames, the photography, the sound, even the rythme of the movie itself.
And it gives a huge impression of majesty.
Far from the simple -gory -narrative standard horror movies that we are used to, ""I Am The Pretty Thing That Lives in The House"", is a jewel of subtlety, and poetry.
It mingles reality and fiction, life and fantasy, with a tasty way of playing with the theme of the ""double"".
And we could be as lost as the characters themselves because of that.
By questioning the limits or the duality of life and fiction, a character and its doppelganger, sanity and madness, sociability and loneliness, horror and poetry, the movie questions the complexity of reality, and gives us one of the most memorable movie masterpiece and some subject to explore...
Definitely a masterpiece"
" Fascinating
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,9,I found this to be a fascinating story. The characters were well written and the story kept me interested the whole way through.
" A really well-executed ye olde ghost story
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,8,"It takes its time building suspense through the repetition of daily routine and the skewing of what's right and what's wrong. It avoids the jump scares that would be favored by most when writing a story like this and the one time the jump scare was expected, it was well prepared and it still scared me as it should. It's not a fast story, it's quite slow, but keeps you glued to the screen. It keeps tugging on your finger, suggesting you put it on it, but every time takes a step back, right until the very end. I enjoyed it."
" Matter
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,7,"I really couldn't entirely spoil the movie for you. Because I think with one time watching this, I did not get the whole message/experience out of it. So I might watch it again. What I can tell you though and what matters: the movie conveys a feeling of dread and tension.Any lingering shot is more suspensful than any teenie horror jump scare movie you'll see. Because it creates a mood. I do think the director does an even better job with Gretel and Hansel, probably because of a bigger budget too. But even this is a showcase of what the director is capable of. It may lack certain ingredients for some, but it still is very well done to say the least ... edge of your seat kind of stuff"
" The writer created a cure for insomnia.
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,1,"The most boring film I have ever seen. No story, no plot, no ending."
" Pretentious
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,5,"Much like many of the other reviews, I found this movie incredibly boring. While I can appreciate a story that celebrates nuance, I felt like this director was more interested in creating something visually artistic than furthering the plot or engaging the viewer. The opening sequence, with its dragging and whispering tone, set the pace for the entire film.
Although I had no specific complaints with the actors' performances, it did feel as though the director was muting their performances to insure the entire film never got above anything more than a dull lull.
Although technically classified as ""horror"", this film felt more akin to the horror stories of the 1950s, rather than today's expectation. I am sure many will find that enjoyable but for me it was incapable of getting my blood really pumping.
The gist of the story involved the tale of a hospice nurse sent to be a live-in caretaker for an elderly horror writer. As time goes on an the patient grows nearer to death, the young nurse begins to experience unexplainable occurrences in the house, leading her to conclude the house is haunted.
Much like any horror movie, dependent on jump scares and the classic ""what's behind the door"" thrills, this film felt more like a watered down version made for viewers who were pregnant or have a heart condition.
I would not recommend watching this alone at night, as you would be in severe danger of falling asleep from boredom..."
" Absolute waste of time
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,1,"2 hours of my life could have been spent better working on a sugar plantation. If people walked faster the film would have been 10 minutes but it was so incredibly slow paced that I was able to take out my phone and play a game of chess while the characters walked across the screen for ten minutes. This movie is so jam packed full of pointless symbolism and literary devices that me and the 4 people I watched it with didn't understand anything. You need an English major degree at least to understand this film. Not only was the film horrifically directed, but it also was not scary in the slightest. Absolutely a horrible film and waste of time. -5/10 worst horror movie I've ever seen."
" boring beyond belief
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,2,Utterly devoid of anything worthy . Even my wife thinks its rubbish...and she is Canadian!
" It's like if the Guy in your MFA twitter wrote a movie
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,1,"The creators of this movie are clearly very impressed with themselves, for no valid reason. To say that something is ""slow burn,"" as so often is applied to this movie, there would have to be even the barest flicker of ignition. I can guess what the movie is trying to say- that identity decays in isolation. It's too bad the main character didn't have an identity to begin with. It's the kind of movie that makes you wonder if the director has ever met a human. If this is your first horror movie, you'll probably still be bored, but you might look upon it more favorably than it deserves. There are some interesting ideas here, but they're all lost in poorly lit scenes, characters that never act like people, the planting and payoff of the most inconsequential things (and the movie is SO VERY PROUD of itself when it does this), and endless, droning narration that does not match either the main character portrayed or the ghost that arguably serves as the antagonist. There is no psychological drama here- there's no psychology. Its a master class in de-escalation, in gutting whatever meager tension it might have accidentally built. The main character is such an incurious wad of a character that she never once bothers to glance at the few creepy things that do happen. When the big secret is revealed, she literally walks past it into a dark room off camera for a full minute. There is nothing going on. It's just an empty set. To be honest, a good half of the movie is just pointless camera angles on empty sets with mediocre goth-blogging narration about nothing of consequence. Yes, I understand that the point of the weird camera angles was that Polly is apparently doing the cinematography. I've played Fatal Frame, so I'm not at all impressed by this much, much worse use of that trick. The original murder doesn't even make any sense. It actively conflicts with the ideas the movie is trying to put forth. It's just a dude with the most aggressive sideburns known to man killing his wife for no discernible reason and choosing the worst way to try to get away with it. What does that have to do with the decay of identity? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.The most common accusation lobbed by people who inexplicably like this meandering fart of a movie is that its detractors are too lowbrow, too glutted on jumpscares and slashers to appreciate a refined, slow burn movie like this. To that I would say reading lifeless prose slowly doesn't magically make it well written, nor is the movie somehow better because it's paced like continental drift. I can completely get behind a movie that takes it time developing its themes, story, and characters, that has a slow journey to a conclusion, but the movie actually has to HAVE those things. This one doesn't. It's a tale told by and idiot, not even given the bare minimum of sound and fury, signifying nothing."
" Only for the hardcores !!
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,10,"Oh My !! Wat a piece of art. Its not just a movie, its a horror experience. Yet i do understand it having such a low rating. Its not for everybody. For a casual horror night with friends its nothing, for hardcores its everything. It stayed with me for a few days.PS : a treat for horror buffs :- The Tunnel, Leaving D.C., The Borderlands, Hell House LLC, Wekufe, Demon(polish)"
" Don't. Just don't.
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,1,"After reading other reviews, I feel compelled to write this for the sake of all humanity. Do not bother with this film. It is god dam awful. Worst film to grace my TV.
DO NOT BOTHER."
" It was unbearable
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,2,"This whole movie could be cut to 10 minutes without really loosing any critical information. The rest is her walking in slow-motion or zooming in on doors/walls. I'm quite irritated and feel like I lost my time by watching this. Even though I had to jump forward after my patience was brutally murdered, still too much time wasted.
It is pretty artistic zooming though. Really nice. But happens too often and a movie should have more action than that."
" Just, terrible
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,1,"This is definitely not a movie for anyone who enjoys good movies. The one dimensional, depressing plot had two twists, neither were ever explained. Characters appeared with no context and no explanation of what role they played in the story, let alone who they were. There was only one scene that could even be described as scary, and that would be a poor description of it. I understand that in the horror genre you have to filter through some bad ones to get to the gems. But there's only up to go from here because this has to be the worst 'horror' movie ever made. I'll still be mad about wasting my time on this one when I'm on my death bed."
" Should have been better
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,5,"This is a slow burn gothic, emphasis on slow that will bore many. The story and presentation had potential but it lacked substance. A good gothic doesn't need gore and cheap quick scares which thankfully this doesn't have but it needs something. Something that will maintain a spooky atmosphere and a full mysterious story to add to the overhaul creepiness factor. This is where it fell short and you may find yourself bored and unfulfilled instead of feeling like you just been taken through a good, spooky ghost story experience."
" What?!
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,1,This movie is so bad and boring that even Ray charles would hate this movie.
" Decent Acting and... that's it
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,2,"I'll start with the reason this didn't get zero stars, aside from the fact that zero stars isn't an option. The acting was decent. Now that that's out of the way, do not waste your time with this movie. It's like the director went out of his way to make this artistic as possible, and didn't care if he knew about art or not. The chair motif is short-lived, nonsensical, and easily overlooked. The intentionally long camera shots, just lingering on a scene that was just left by a character, clearly trying to fill you with dread of seeing something happen, are over done, take up the majority of the movie (as the whole thing would be five minutes if you cut the shots where nothing at all happens), and add nothing to the ambiance that was intended. Lastly, I am all for ambiguity and ambiguous endings, but in this case we're supposed to come up with the entire story ourselves. Nothing is given. Not a single clue as to what the heck is going on. It's the kind of movie you struggle to finish without falling asleep, and then when it's over you yell at the credits ""that's it?! What did I just see?! How much of my life did I just waste?!"" Sitting through the whole movie should be the new cinnamon challenge. You're left with a dry mouth, uncomfortable, and you wonder what has become of your life you're able to waste your time with something so stupid.
PS- the narration... just why? It wasn't poetic, it didn't add to the mood, it didn't make a solid theme... why?!"
" I Am The Unfortunate Thing To Have Watched This In My House
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,2,"When you are told the main character's fate at the beginning of a film, you are naturally left thinking there must be more to the film. Unfortunately this isn't the case here.
There are some eerie early scenes where the build up tension is actually good. The director is clearly good at setting such scenes. These are let down however, by the final scare not being scary at all. For instance, a character screaming at the camera with the viewer not being shown what is so terrifying until the moment is gone, feels like a complete waste of a tense build up to it.
The frequent narration throughout the film makes this feel more like a timid ghost story or Gothic poem more than a horror. This may have been intended, along with the ambiguity of much of the film. But there are too many events open to interpretation to satisfy any viewer. To me this was a waste of time. I would avoid this."
" Febrile Fervid Metier
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,10,"The condign divisive film for the Ages. Oz Perkins is an auteur maligned on the peripheral fringe of a clandestine genre known as arthouse horror.Commonly misunderstood through the out of focus lense of the non-spectrum populous. Who lack foresight, hindsight, and well, insight. Displayed through a certain level of unsightliness in their congenital vapidness. Speaking to art in general, this is ""historically accurate"".To speak of an elusive narrative, is to speak on a categorical miss, entirely. This is a challenging atmospheric mood piece. That is a celluloid piece of art, with a story told, almost exclusively visually. It encompasses the best cinematography and sound editing, I've come across to date. It is a pulchritudinous gothic masterpiece. To speak of it otherwise is to partake in unarguable blasphemy."
" I've never been so bored in my life
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,1,"I love horror movies and after all the bad horror movies I've ever seen this was quite easily the slowest, least entreating horror movie ever. No plot, so much monologue that I just wanted to throw a remote at the TV, and just no redeeming features. Please don't waste your time on this, you'll thank you."
" So slow and so boring...
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,1,"This movie is so slow and so exhaustingly boring, that I fell asleep three times and had to rewind it to catch up. The thing is, since it's so slow, I didn't even miss much happening.Anyway. Aside from that, the entire story is beyond dull! It doesn't even tell a story. There's this old writer, right? And this nurse gets hired to look after her. The writer keeps calling he ""Polly"" and she starts asking who on Earth is Polly only after 11 months of being called so. Who wrote that?!Then we have the investigation of who Polly is. The nurse is encouraged to read a book by the author, so she can find out about Polly. Turns out Polly is a ghost who lives in the house. She's the ghost of a young woman, who got killed ages ago, but it never becomes clear why. A vague story of the house's first owners is told, which says of a man who built the house with his own hands. He then married a woman and they vanished on their wedding day, before even moving in. The viewer is left tho think if the two stories are connected and if Polly and the bride are the same person. Never really cleared out who, what, why...I honestly hope this was a gigantic metaphor, which I just couldn't get. Still, it doesn't change the fact that it bored me beyond anything I've ever seen. The entire movie seemed like it was in slow motion! I wanted to raise the speed like x16 in order to make it watchable. So phlegmatic!"
" Slow and uneventful
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,2,"It wasn't scary. There's a sort of spooky ghost that you see a few times, and someone dies. Neither of those things are very scary, just unnecessarily suspenseful. The rest of the movie is just slow and boring. I could tell this whole story in full detail in less than 2 minutes, whereas this movie took an hour and a half. Save yourself from an evening of boredom."
" Don't do it!
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,1,"Oh how I wish I had read these reviews before I started this film!I am one of those odd people, if I have committed 20 minutes to a film I absolutely HAVE to make it to the end. I watched Halloween 3 and The Exorcist 2 right to the end. This film, I couldn't make it passed about 40 minutes. It felt like 2 hours!
There is no real plot, nothing keeping you gripped or on edge. The main character is irritatingly sappy with an awful fake American accent and the most interesting part is the upside down chair hung on the wall.To anyone that watched the whole film, I salute you."
" Slow Burn Gothic Poetry
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,5,"Worth a sitting if you love Gothic literature. If this movie had shaved 30-45 minutes off, it would have been better. The movie feels like a very long, long, long poem. Beautifully shot and written, however the movie struggles to fill the runtime of a feature film.
The main character tells us she just turned 28 but won't see 29. I was frustrated with the movie for only showing the first and last few days of her time in the house. There was nearly a year in between but we don't know anything about it. This is my biggest complaint. She seems to sense something is off before we cut to several months later and she seems fine. Then she feels like something is off again... I don't understand why there needed to be a time jump really.
There are some questions left unanswered, but they don't really need answered. This isn't a think-piece. This is just a beautiful movie that overstayed it's welcome a bit."
" Totally boring
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,1,"The Monologe of lily goes on and on, as is the movie.
Nothing scary about it.
Cheap low budget movie made movie. Netflix, that says all.
Boring as hell.
I don't understand how people could even to consider to give it so many stars."
" Painfully Slow
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,1,"Everything about this was just slow. The story line, the motion, turning the pages of a pile of paper. It builds anticipation and gives you nothing. It's lacking a lot of background and I feel like I've and hour of my life in the hope the film would deliver some excitement"
" Not a horror film
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,2,"This film is very artfully made, but really, really, really boring. No story, nothing. Just a random collection of ""atmospheric"" scenes and a voiceover consisting of phrases that are repeated over and over. I spent most of the film looking at furniture or main character's weird upper lip (by the way - why cast someone clearly way past their 20s to play a 28 y.o?)
Anyway, maybe there is something in this film but I clearly missed it."
" If you want to waste 3 hours of your life watching a 1 hour 29minutes long movie, then this is a perfect choice.
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,1,"It was a great trailer for the movie, didn't spoil anything about the actual footage you're about to see, then I came to realize that it didn't spoil anything because there wasn't anything to see.This might actually be the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire lifetime.I wish for no future generations to ever see this movie.Best regards, Mike Hawk"
" What's the point?
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,1,"None of the characters had a back story. The author, one of the main characters, makes about 4 short appearances for no other purpose then to speak nonsense about Polly trying to be symbolically intriguing. The nurse, also throughout tries to speak symbolic drivel in an almost whisper to fall asleep to while we watch spans of empty rooms of the house the whole time. It's a nice house I suppose. And she speaks a lot throughout. It's like shes trying to do poetry throughout the movie. It's really annoying. The point is none of the characters had a backstory so it was very un interesting and there was no point to it. Just very slow and dull and purposeless. She literally walked through the house for 10 min in one scene at the end saying nothing, it was just silence so I fell asleep until she did that awful shrek and my eyes bursted open. That was the climax."
" Eerie Vibe but Uneventful
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,5,"First of all, it was great to see actress Paula Prentice, contributing to the eerie feel of the film as an elderly horror author with Alzheimer's who believes Polly from her books is haunting her home. A hospice nurse arrives as the new caregiver and slowly realizes that there is a ghostly presence. This slow burn ghost story has been done before and much better in movies like ""The Others"". If you like something that is mysterious but not too scary, this may be your thing. Others may find it dull. It definitely has an eerie vibe with is maintained throughout."
" Music is the only enthralling part
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,2,"Don't waste your time on this, it is so poorly done and the only horrific part is the music which was actually pretty scary when it needed to be. It reads very heavily like a short story or novel much like The Lighthouse but unlike it there is little dialogue and little happening at all. I couldn't take it so I jumped forward for the sake of understanding and in the end it wasn't really worth it... It would have benefitted from being a 20-30 minute short."
" The Gothic Horror look was different, but the storyline was missing.
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,2,"So... Just finished watching the movie. The movie itself is VERY slow moving, and if you nod off, you might miss something. But at the same time, I didn't nod off and still didn't fully understand the movie.
So... This movie follows a live in caretaker for a gothic horror novelist, and throughout the movie the caretaker, Lily, is confused for Polly from Iris Blum, the old woman (gothic horror novelist). You learn that Polly is the main character from Blum's novel: ""The lady in the walls"".
The storyline of the novel: no one ever knows. Lily, the caretaker, is too much of a chicken and never reads the novel to understand the importance of Polly. And when I first heard of Polly, I thought she might've been Blum's sister for some odd reason, and then I thought Polly might've been Blum's mother or aunt. But even then, you almost feel as though Polly is a real person because of the ""flashbacks"" you see when watching the movie.
Also, you never know when seeing the ""flashbacks"" if the man is Polly's husband, or some friend. It's never explained, so no one knows. And then we are expected to believe that the man after killing Polly threw her body inside the wall and boarded it up. We don't even understand the whole scene: but it looks like Polly is playing a Marco Polo or hide and seek game with the ""husband"" to only be murdered and be boarded up in the wall.
You get the impression that Iris Blum, Lily Saylor, and Polly have some type of connection, but the audience never is told what type of connection that is, so no one ever knows.
There's also no answer to why Polly was showing herself to Lily, as well as we don't know if Blum had ever seen Polly's ghost in her home, but at the same time, you assume that Blum had seen Polly's ghost because she talks about how Polly walked backwards and other stuff.
--------------------------------------- SPOILER ALERT-------------------------------------------
I'm just going to throw it out there. I was SURPRISED that not only Blum died by the end of the movie, but Lily died as well. What you can believe is that Lily was so scared at seeing Polly's ghost, she has a heart attack and dies. I think every person can admit that they expected Blum to die, but it was a complete surprise that Lily died too in the movie.
It's also confusing towards the end of the movie after the two women are dead: you see a younger version of Blum and the current Lily... It makes you think that Lily's ghost (soul) after death is now in the same realm with Blum's soul, or the younger version of Blum's soul. It is confusing because you think they're not in a different realm and in the now, but there's no true explanation.
Also, I personally don't understand why Lily's arms were blackened in certain parts, then swell and look gray, to only look normal again a second later. I'm guessing that either had to do with Polly affecting the situation, or to show her that she's nearing death every minute, or something else entirely.
The overall movie is not scary by any means of the imagination, but there are at least 2 jump scares. Other than that, this movie definitely has you thinking about death and how that ties into the film. This film, in my opinion, is definitely a gothic horror movie not because the film seems to lack the mansion and decor of a gothic horror, but because of the novel, Polly's ghost, and just the vibe of the movie is of that essence. But in terms of storyline, there wasn't one. I read some of the comments, and though some people saw the film as Blum's house being a type of portal for the dead between the dead and the living. And though I might be able to believe that, but at the same time, the film was confusing.
------------------------------------------- SPOILER ALERT-----------------------------------------
Also, we are told in the narration that it seems, like Polly, that Lily's ghost will ""haunt"" the house, and that no living human should live in the house. Though we see that it seems a new family has moved into the house at the end of the movie, I half expected to see Lily's ghost walking around the house, but was surprised to see Polly's ghost walking around. The way it seems, it looks that Blum was ready to die, and so her soul moved onto the next realm, but because Polly was murdered and Lily unexpectedly died because of a heart attack, they both were not ready to move onto the next realm, so they decided to stay at the house.
I would only want to see a sequel only if there's a little more meat in the story (have more of a storyline) and have the family actually try to understand why Polly and Lily are haunting the house.
This is a movie that I don't mind admitting that I watched the movie, but not a movie I would watch again unless I had insomnia, or something similar. I didn't hate the movie because it was visually different from anything I watch on the daily, but I wouldn't plan on watching this movie again. I can just explain to other people in simple terms of this movie and they can get the best idea possible.If you want to watch a movie that makes no sense, but is slightly visually stunning, then this movie fits you. Otherwise, if you're like me and don't do the slow moving movies that make no sense and raises more questions than answers, then don't watch it. Along with that: if you want a Friday the 13th or Halloween movie, then this movie is not for you."

This is an intelligent, atmospheric ghost story that holds the screams, holds the ""gotcha"" moments and lets it play itself out with a smart rhythm that brings a chilling creep nest that few movies of this sort can. You know it's going the be a bumpy ride when Athens always great Ruth Wilson introduces her self with a matter of fact reading of her characters intro with the line about it was my 28th birthday I would not live to have my 29th. Oz Perkins , the actor Anthony's son, working from his script, builds tension with atmosphere, a solid musical score, great photography and a perfect supporting cast, although it is up to Ms. Wilson to carry the burden, which she does in both the narration & her spot on portrayal of the main character. I found it a worthwhile endeavor from start to finish. A damn good ghost story!"
" This movie is complete and utter crap. Lazy screenwriting and terrible transitions.
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,1,I can't believe I wasted my time on this movie. Very confusing plot. The only good thing about this disaster of a movie was the excitement of seeing the old woman in a gown. I was always hoping she would be over although I know she is an old bag. Near the end when she does what all living things do in the end her foot showed on her dead body. It was a very good shot and I paused on it for 2 hours to stare at her feet. Also why is she such a stupid head. And who the frick was he guy who killed Polly?????????? Why did she have a blindfold on?????? Why isn't the old woman nude during the movie?????? I cannot believe this. Now I have to rewatch it to see if I missed a nip slip or some sort of nudity by the elderly woman.
" Awful Movie
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,1,"I'm a massive Ruth Wilson fan, but this was just dreadful. I'm genuinely upset at myself for wasting the 1hr 24 mins that I'll never get back!!"
" Oh dear, so dull, painfully slow
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,1,"The trailer looked promising, but it went downhill from there. One and a half hours of waiting for something to happen. Don't bother."
" Like a gothic poem put on the big screen...
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,7,"If your tastes are Blair Witch Project, Hostel etc. - those movies are a dime a dozen - go elsewhere as you'll find lots of gratuitous blood/gore, mindless, time-wasting movies in that style.If you can appreciate understated horror - with great cinematography, lighting, sound, dialog and general atmosphere, you will like it. Although set in a single location throughout the entire film, for the discerning eye you will be surprised at how well the film is put together and will not be ""bored"", but rather transfixed to the end. The story line I found a little difficult to follow - but it does wrap up in to some degree back to where it starts at the end. All the creepiness factor is blended in throughout, there are only a few shock/terror points.Overall, I wouldn't call myself a horror fan but if it's done well; I'll watch it. Additionally since this was gothic horror - what I consider a higher class of horror (if such a thing exists) - it provided me further motivation to watch it. I'll definitely be revisiting this movie - even if it's just to see once again the technical artistry used to make the film."
" Meh
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,3,Don't want I saved you the trouble it's not very good and very SLOW
" Slow but steady and chilling
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,6,Definitely creepy and chilling. It won't scare your pants off while you're watching... but maybe when you're home alone and hear a thump in the dark.
" This Will Be Short - Don't Waste Your Time
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,1,"Short Review- Just don't want anyone else to waste 1.5 precious hours watching this horrible movie. There was absolutely nothing positive about it, if I could give zero stars I definitely would.I'll start by saying that the movie drags on from start to finish VERY slow. The Script had no clear direction, very boring unless you enjoy movies about a hospice worker who walks around a big ""scary"" house talking to herself, on the phone or narration for the entire film.Which leads me to the cast. I'll be 100% blunt on this one. Where did they find these actresses and actors. This had to have been the worst acting by a lead actress EVER. Simply horrible, I'm sorry but she was really really bad.Hope I saved you from dying of boredom."
" I Am Pretty Sure This Was Boring
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,6,"What's scary is how boring this is. There is a great sense of atmosphere created, only to linger in some scenes for way, way, way (I'm tawkin' WAY!) too long! Oh, my God, get on with it! Waiting for it to get to the end credits felt like waiting to die! Long silences are not as artsy fartsy as some would have you believe. I was really looking forward to this movie, but it was a chore."
" I am the reviewer here to say it's not bad
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,9,"I think the main problem is so many people are giving reviews when they either don't u eefstabd it or it's not their style of horror. Fine. There are plenty others out there. But I fear the low rating will keep fans of gothic horror away from this one and that would be a damn shame. It is a definite slow burn, but it has a constant creep and eeriness going steadily through. I was not bored once. Again, if this film bores you, I'd advise you look into the movie genre before bashing something you don't understand. Watch a gore fest and call it good."
" A visual poem
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,8,"On the surface, it begins like any old haunted house flick: the protagonist, Lily, is a young hospice nurse who moves into a big house to take care of its single frail inhabitant, an elderly novelist suffering from dementia. Now we sit back and wait for the scares to start, trying to guess what sort of dark secret the old writer may be hiding, and whether it could be anything original. Surely we've seen this story unfold so many times before, right? Wrong.The reviews of this film are really mixed, and I can readily understand why anyone would want to stop watching and be disappointed in something that subverts almost everything we know and love about horror movies. However, it's precisely that refusal to fit in any mould that makes it stand out and resonate with the viewer long after the credits roll. It also relies on those very irregularities to drive its point home.There's nothing formulaic about this film, and yet it manages to strike a chord and be utterly unnerving and tense. It moves so slowly and seemingly without direction.First of all, the narrative is supremely disjointed, with a jump of 11 months that aren't accounted for, and the rest of the time we catch glimpses of Lily doing things around the house. Disfigurement and rotting play an important role in the film's visual symbolism, and I see the disfigured narrative as form being true to function.Next, the protagonist is nothing like what we're used to in horror films: the plucky survivor who goes out exploring the spooky house with a flashlight and a laugh. Lily is terrified of everything and can barely make herself read a horror novel. That's why it's not completely accurate to say she's trying to unravel the mystery, because a huge part of this film is concerned with seeing vs. choosing not to see. I believe a great amount of the tension comes as a result of the viewer desperately wanting to know and getting frustrated in their curiosity, which clashes with Lily's need to avoid seeing. The blinds in the house are constantly lowered, not once does she touch a light switch, and many reviews point out that she frequently takes off her glasses when she turns to look at something (my initial take was that she does this because they're reading/TV glasses, but we do see her watching a movie without them later on).Another very powerful theme explored in the movie is isolation and the inability to connect with others, as witnessed several times: the one-sided telephone call that sounds extremely awkward and ends with the receiver being yanked out of Lily's hand, Ms. Blum blundering into the room while Lily's tinkering with the television, the estate being unconcerned with Lily's well-being and counting the days until Ms. Blum passes away, Ms. Blum's monologue about the decay of pretty things that only makes sense in the grand scheme of things, and so on and so forth.Just as Ms. Blum's most widely acclaimed novel is left unfinished, so too must the viewer infer many things for themselves in this poetic exercise in sparse storytelling. Yes, it involves watching some scenes over and over again several times, and contemplating how some pieces of the puzzle fit together.Altogether, it seems like a piece of art made for art's sake rather than for ratings or the box office, which is a rare thing in itself and deserves respect. The performances are wonderful, the atmosphere dark and filled with foreboding, and just when you're led into thinking there's so much wasted potential here, the movie really does come back to you like a song."
" Complet waste of time.
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,1,"Nothing gets explained, yhe whole thing is a confusing mess. A lot of annoying narration that just goes in circles and explains nothing. Whoever wrote this garbage seriously needs to never make a movie again. Please and thank you."
" Extremely frightening but depressing
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,7,"This movie is from the same director as my favorite 'The Blackcoats Daughter'. While 'I am the Pretty..' isn't as exciting as the former, it is extremely frightening. After a few watches I had to discard it though, as ultimately it depressed me."
" Not as good as February
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,6,"After being impressed with Perkins' first feature in which he both wrote and directed, I quickly sought out information regarding his second feature where once again he both writes and directs. While this is an interesting film I have to say that it was a slight let down over February (The Blackcoat's Daughter). I do still think though that he is a director to keep an eye on in the future.We follow the story of Lily (Wilson) who we see arrive at the creepy old house of former author Iris Blum (Prentiss). As the film progresses we start to see similarities between what appear to be things happening to Lily, and the happenings in a book written long ago by Blum. All the while we are hearing a narrative told by Lily in the past tense. This also serves as the bulk of the actual dialogue within the film.I Am the Pretty Thing is a very stylized film and is perfectly shot. The film itself has a haunting quality and look and feel to it. Its major downside though is that it is an awfully slow burner which never gets up a head of steam. I can't say that I was ever bored though or thought time was dragging while watching but the film certainly does run at an excruciatingly slow pace.I can understand why some people would be turned off by it. Its style is not for everyone. The film is beautiful to look at and the photography is a delight. The score is also fantastic and fits the film perfectly. Unfortunately though the film does tend to meander a little and the whole thing is a little shallow. The plot is rather weak and not terribly well executed, though there is plenty of ambiguity as to what is going on and why.As ghost story's go this is not a bad effort and I certainly enjoyed the look and feel of the film, but I don't really think the film is aimed at a wide-stream audience. And this perhaps accounts for many of its low ratings and negative reviews. If you like art-house ghostly goings on, then I would recommend this as something slightly different to the norm.
The Sage's Rating: 6/10"
" Don't bother
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,2,"This is one of those films you just wished you could have your time given back to you from watching it. It was terrible, so slow and most of the film you watch a woman talking to herself"
" One of the most boring movies I have ever seen
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,1,"The main character walks the slowest I have ever seen someone walk before. Nothing happens until she finally dies (off screen) at the end. Sadly, that doesn't stop her from doing a super boring voice over at the end of the movie. This isn't one of those movies that are so bad it's good, it's just so bad it's bad. Bad and boring."
" Idiotic
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,1,"Waste of time, one of the worst movies ever made. No plot, no nothing."
" 😞
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,8,If you're a dim witted person who doesn't enjoy a good movie then this is probably not for you.
" Only watch this if you like poetry
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,1,"This movie poses as a horror movie, but to me it feels alot like a very long poorly written poem, and whoever wrote it considers itself smartere than in actuality.It is full of lines that are spoken very well by the actors, but carries no meaning.I guess the ending atleast gave a bit of closure, but not worth the wait."
" features some of the scariest moments in recent cinema
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,10,"OhMyGod this movie terrified me. Everything about it: the pacing, the characters, the never relenting sense of DREAD... Just a magnificently executed piece of cinema. We all knew Ruth Wilson was tremendous from her work on the Affair, but here she SOARS. The emotional pain that seethes under the surface here is palpable, and she never wavers in her conviction. The filmmaking here is a triumph - lighting and shadows and score all used to perfection. The jist of it it is this: you can see a horror movie with blood and guts and murder for two hours and not be scared once - then be home late at night alone and here a creak and be terrified. That's what this movie is: a two-hour long CREAK of TERROR. Beautiful imagery here as well, and metaphors galore. Gothic Lit is brought to present day life with this painstakingly thought out and executed work of art. It really asks: 'what are we afraid of? what in life haunts us? who are we frightened of becoming?' If you need a thrill a minute type of film, skip it, but if you actually like the classics, this is a modern day revisitation. 10 Stars+++"
" Boring. Hard to stay awake for this
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,5,"This movie was a tease in so many ways. I thought it was going for a fun artsy feel with the narration and some ghostly scenes that seemed like portraits come to life. Then there were things like the chair on the ceiling that you keep expecting to fall or have a reason or anything. Not much happened at all in this movie, which I thought I heard good things about but must've confused it with something else. Very low budget and a waste of time. Kept waiting for it to get better and it never did."
" Atmosphere is not a replacement for story
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,4,"I am new to reviewing and frankly, I have read some amazing reviews of this movie, so there is no point dwelling on the oft-repeated aspect of the slowness of the film - it is, and that is very clearly the intention. I get it - every film-maker wants to make a mark and one way to do that is to try and do something 'controversial', like slow the movie down so much that perhaps we are supposed to all reflect on how we live such 'fast' paced lives or something.... but it doesn't really excuse the lack of story.The writer needs to remember that this isn't a book - albeit that I get the sense he is trying to make the film appear to have the pace of a book; that is to say, when you read it, because you are reading every word, the action does take place slower than real time. The problem with that is that in only an hour and a half, we haven't gone very far... there was no time left to include story because of all the super-slow-mo creeping around - at that rate, it would have made a better mini-series than a movie.I have to admit, I am a story-led movie watcher, so I get that it isn't the only criterion for everyone (some people gave it a ten) - but with this film, there was just so much of a story left untold that as a viewer, you just feel cheated. It's as though we are supposed to write it in our imagination - and I object to that. To me, it just feels lazy. Also, beginner's creative writing 101 - completely absent back story! I didn't care what happened to the only real character (let's face it, Bob Balaban is excellent in all he does, but is barely in it and the old lady is only really a poor cipher.) because I didn't know a thing about her - I wasn't even all that convinced that she WAS talking to her friend on the phone in the beginning...So we have no back-story which means we care nothing about the characters, no story development - which meant, amongst a myriad of other plot threads left trailing.... that we never even know why Polly's husband smashed her over the head and hid her in a wall in the first place... maybe she was as boring as her living counterpart..? Let's face it, that would make a believable motive. Other than that, I couldn't think of a single reason, given that they just got married and she was certainly beautiful enough to keep most newly-wed men happy. I mean, surely, given how much she harps on about the dreadfulness of the end, it was critical to our understanding of her subsequent haunting that we understand what happened? I mean, was that even her husband who killed her..?? We can't even be sure of that so clearly, it couldn't have been all that relevant.I, like so many other people, am fairly easily entertained - it doesn't take much to amuse me. But I need SOMETHING!! So while the film was all very well made, (hence 4 stars, not 1) it lacked absolutely everything else needed to get an audience interested."
" If I could give this movie a 0 star I would.
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,7,I have no words for how slow and useless this movie is.
" I am the painful thing that puts you to sleep...
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,1,"Wow, it's great for insomnia. I just wish I hadn't of rewound it, after I woke back up (a few times) because I literally missed nothing.The narration was awful. It was as painful to listen to, as the movie was to watch. It was a movie disguised as art but it was just pretentious and boring.Polly, a character in the book and in the walls, in real life. How did she die? Murder. Why? I have no clue. By who? I have no clue. How? Possible hide in seek gone wrong...The scariest part was the phone cord being ripped from her shoulder as she babbled on. My guess is, Polly was tired of her voice as well.Upside down chair, hanging on the wall. I would love to know why. Most interesting part to the movie and it's never addressed.Can't sleep? Watch it you silly goose. Type of dialogue used throughout. Zzzzzzz"
" Gentle but still creepy
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,8,I think this film is special. The plot seem normal but it's not really as same as all motips. It has many meanings in the movie and all most of the jumpscare scenes still give me goosebump.
" Infortunately, I did not get it. And I really tried.
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,4,"Good acting, and I like Ruth Wilson. But it's the plot and the story who is almost empty. 80 minutes flew away and I was still waiting for what will happen, when will arrive the explanation of many things. But nothing.What was the message? What happened in there? Why did that happen to the protagonist and why Polly did that? Still wondering.It hasn't happened to me in a long time to see something so much unclear.It might have a profound meaning for the director, but if he does it for the people and people don't get it at all, what's the purpose?It could have more potential, such a pity."
" If the coronavirus was a film
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,1,"I wish i was dead after watching this. She didn't make it to 29 and i'm gutted this made it to netflix.I'll never get that hour and a half back, thank you, netflix."
" If watching someone slowly walk around a house for 90 minutes is your thing, this is the movie for you.
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,1,"But for me, it was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen."
" Fantastic
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,10,"This is pure gothic horror, and it's excellent. It knows exactly what it's doing. Anyone who's slamming it, well, they're expecting Paranormal Activity or some other garbage.This is smart, capable storytelling. It's got enough atmosphere to fill an entire jump-and-scare franchise from first movie to ninth."
" Shoot me now
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,1,"This movie had such a big impact on me that I set up an account just so I could write a review about it. The film is very slow to start. 10 minutes in I picked up my phone and found something else to keep me occupied. Then I started getting looks off my girlfriend. She is more of a stayer than me. I felt bad, I thought 'maybe I need to try harder', so I did. So after about an hour and a half of build up, I was waiting for a big finish. It never happened. This is by far the worst film I have ever seen in my entire life and I will never let this happen again. Me and my girlfriend were solid, we share the same values, the same beliefs and have the same dreams and life ambitions, but since watching this movie, that she chose and the looks that I got when I was looking at properties in France that I am never going to buy, I feel nothing but resentment. I don't know if we will ever get past this. I just want the time back or to lose all memory that this ever happened. The decision makers at Netflix really need to take a good hard look at themselves for having this on there."
" An eerie and dark poem of life after death.
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,8,"Creepy and unnerving from beginning to end, it's written like a poem where each new chapter and event is spoken as an eerie monologue. The main actress has a voice well beyond her years reminicent of women from the early 1900's, she speaks in an cracked whisper, like someone reading a eulogy holding back tears, gave me shivers.The cinematography was beautiful, from the slow moving fades to black in door ways symbolic of the ever creeping darkness living in the house. To the subtle growing and shrinking blur of the ghost making it's presence more apparent, that forces you to focus on the scene. The fixation of objects or the main character in clear view in front of blurred backgrounds were captivating.The score was sublime and subtle, the ghost spoke softly in the background and to the main character, that gave me chills, a reminder that it wasn't just in her head. The use of violin in suspenseful moments was beautifully dark and the soft reverberating of white noise fit the scenes perfectly.There was so much silence in the movie that I really got the feeling that I was in that creepy house with her hearing the subtle thud of the ghost walking around the house, doors and walls creeking, as they would in an old house, those sounds stayed with me as they reminded me of my gran's house which also made sounds like that, leaving me shivering under my blanket as a child.The movie uses the imagination and fear to it's advantage, from the first five minutes of the movie the main character tells us that she will not live longer than a year in that house so we know there isn't a happy ending. But it is the way that they slowly reach that outcome which kept me in suspense of what I didn't see more than what I did.The acting was the best I've seen in a ghost horror movie to date, it was intelligent and heart-wrenching. The main character seems genuinely afraid of the house and doesn't just chalk it off to her mind playing tricks on her until it's too late. Her slow decline into darkness was effortlessly portayed. Whether it was through the lonliness and mental strain of being alone in a house for nearly a year or the ghost slowly draining the life from her, it is evident throughout that the outcome is inevitable.What stayed with me most well after the movie was the words the writter used to describe the scenario in such a beautifully, bitter-sweet, dark, nuanced tone and pace. It is a brillaint piece of writing and cinematography that I would recommend to any horror fan who loves a slow burner."
" Genre: Mysteriously boring
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,1,"Remove the genre ""Horror"" and ""Thriller"" and you'll see what it is. ""Mysteriously boring"". To be honest, after fighting to finish this movie I don't even know what it's all about? I never felt so alone in my whole life. Who's willing to spend money on stuff like this? I don't know, but I hope you read this and you save a lot of time."
" Well filmed. That's about it
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,2,"Painfully slow moving, made no sense, no climax. Well filmed in a creepy way. I would not recommend"
" A Perfect Blend Of Unsettling Environment and Horror Through The Tone And Cinematography
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,10,"Sitting on the comfort of my couch and freezing from the winter cold in the middle of the night, I stumbled upon this movie on Netflix. Curious, I started watching it.The whole cinematography and the creepy tone that's set gave me chills throughout the movie (or maybe it was just the cold). As the story started to unfold and the slow pacing of uneasiness started to get to me, I felt the pounding of my heart and the goosebumps across my whole body; it was at this moment that I decided to give it 10 stars for achieving the feeling of scariness that happens once in a blue moon with horror movies.Although the buildup was unsettling and the characters, tone and direction did their best to create that feeling, the climax felt underwhelming (and it's the same case with some other reviews I've seen). Nonetheless, in the world of bad horror movies, it's one of the better ones."
" If you have insomnia this will help.
",2019-11-29 00:00:00,1,"It's rare I'm compelled to join a website in order to leave a review but this movie was dreadful and I felt it was my duty to warn others before wasting hours of their life on this dreary, tedious non story.There are zero scares and for some reason many scenes are done in what I can only describe as long, drawn out, slow-motion almost in an effort to bore you to death or some insane attempt to create tension?The acting is awful, just awful.Don't bother unless you need to be sent to sleep."
" Sooo sloooowwww
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,1,"This movie moved so incredibly slow, there were many moments when I yelled at that screen, ""Oh my GOD, get on with it!"" A lot of time killing with the characters doing absolutely nothing. Probably the worst horror movie I've ever seen."
" Way too long, pacing entirely incorrect
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,2,"This would have been a great Short, but trying to stretch a short into a feature film length makes for a very slow and, I'm sorry to say, extraordinarily boring movie."
" Nothing happens
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,1,"I love psychological and slow burn horror, but this movie wasn't good. I knew in the first 20mins nothing was going to happen offhand but as it down to 40 mins left without anything happening I was disappointed. I usually don't care what others say about a film but wish I would of saw the reviews before I decided to watch this film, this film was on my Netflix list for 6 months."
" Enjoyed
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,7,"Really strong style of movie making which simmers slowly. Fanatsstic narration. I don't think this film will appeal to everyone, especially audiences that wish to see super 'scary' I have to say though I quite like this wave of slightly weird movies. I don't find them dull like others more interesting and at times haunting."
" What was that? Ruth how could you?
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,1,"Cant believe that the brilliant Ruth Wilson agreed to act in this film.If i could sue Netflix for stealing my time, i would.Still cant work out what the big fuss was about Polly walking backwards? Then it turns about that its only part of her thats backwards.Did the mould kill everyone off. Heard lots of lies and water sprinklers but never saw one?Lost the will to live i expect like i did, waiting for an end that never came. Yawn...."
" Boring
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,3,"Quite a boring movie if you ask me. I barely jumped once when the girl appears in the tv reflection, the scare factor was basically zero. The storyline itself isn't very interesting or compelling."
" Nah mate
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,2,"I mean, it's not a bad cast but damn, it made for painful viewing. I'm never getting that time back. I could've been doing something worthwhile, like organising my box of screws. Plot was poor, acting was ok, and as another reviewer pointed out, the chair stole the show. Premise was good, just poorly executed."
" An artistic experiment gone wrong
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,5,"The director just loved the look of the ""pretty thing"" and tried to built the whole movie around those like 3 second it appears.
Just boring."
" Boring and dull only for those of a like mind
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,9,"This film is a fine example of gothic horror story telling. It builds atmosphere and suspense very well, and I chalk up these negative reviews to the inundation of schlock jump-scare ridden horror movies. People have equated horror to over-the-top blood and gore, cheap scares, and well-timed screeching musical notes. And that's fine, if you want something dumb and bad and cheap. I enjoy such films when I want a laugh. But ""I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives In the House"" is not that. It is carefully made to build mystery and suspense, and I think it fills a gap that most other horror movies fail to."
" Evict her already!
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,1,"A Netflix original, which, if I were Bobby Netflix, I wouldn't bragging about. The pointlessly long title is the first hint at what you're in for. Essentially, Ruth Wilson mumbles. Ruth Wilson looks confused. Ruth Wilson moves about as quickly as a slug on Xanax. I think ""I Am the Pretty Thing That Watches Paint Dry"" would be a much more exciting film. Now I know how Joel Hodgson felt on MST3K when he had to watch ""Manos: Hands of Fate."" And indeed, throughout this movie I kept shouting at my screen, ""DO SOMETHING!"" It certainly was horrifying, but not for any of the intended reasons."
" Boring with nothing new
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,4,"Normally I enjoy slow burns, but from the beginning of the movie, it tells you that the main character is the ghost. Okay, got it. Then, throughout the whole movie, it throws little signs at you like ""look, the ghost,,,, "" to make you wonder who she was when she was alive and whatnot.Considering I was intrigued about what happened, I continued watching the movie. At what was supposed to be the climax, it was the main character discovering everything that we as an audience already knew and had been told throughout the whole movie. The execution itself was fairly poor and uninteresting, and the conclusion that followed was less interesting.As a whole, I would've liked the story of the ghost and her story that she followed until then, rather than the main character discovering the ""truth""."
" Not interesting in the slightest
",2019-09-10 00:00:00,1,"Anyone giving this movie more than 3 stars has got to be a paid shill. They want to compare it to gothic horror, and someone even dared to compare it to Lovecraft. They tried too hard to set the tone of a ghost story, but the narrative was boring and used every cliche in the book. It felt like some 8th graders attempt to show their teacher they could describe every detail in their story. The acting was bad, the story was bad, and there was nothing redeeming about this movie. I'm all for a good horror movie without jump scares, I would prefer it. But this was slow and uneventful."
" Warning! Major typo!!
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,1,"The description of this movie has a huge typo. It is described as as a horror movie. Anyone who has seen the movie quickly realizes that it should read HORRIBLE movie. My husband fell asleep for the last hour but I was quickly able to bring him up to speed by simply saying, ""The nurse walked around"""
" It have so much potential...
",2019-08-16 00:00:00,2,"It's having one really nice idea of movie. And I love movies, that are not so easy to understand; you should use your mind for be inside the plot. But here you even don't want to be inside the plot because it's all sooo slowly. All the movie is in one home, thats style of movie exist, but this together with the screen mostly dark throughout all the movie is really annoying. I was going even tired and lazy watching this. I just can't recommend, it's my opinion about. It's really not low quality whatsoever. And it really puts you good in the time back (60s, 70s) but the too dark atmosphere (not scary) it's simply too much. There are so much better movies. And the protagonist is not really sympathetic. If you like to be entertained of slowly, long breathing ghost movies then it's good for you. Otherwise I can't recommend. Was hard for me to finish it even and I will never watch it again."
" Long drawn out nothingness
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,1,This movie draws you in just to reel you into a downward spiral into something that could have been a lot better. While I understand where the story tried to go it left me beyond a bit wanting.
" A film thats more unsettling than outright horror
",2019-08-09 00:00:00,5,"A caveat is necessary here: I don't give this movie 5 out of ten stars because I disliked it or think that the film is only average. In fact, I think there's a lot to like, if not exactly love about this film. I highly recommend that you see it.The movie follows Lily (Ruth Wilson) who comes to work as a live-in nurse for the elderly horror writer Iris Blum (Paula Prentiss). Unfortunately, strange goings on begin to happen and Lily becomes convinced that the house is haunted by the ghost of Polly Parsons (Lucy Boynton), a woman who was the subject of Blum's novels.If I have reservations about the movie, it's because I don't quit know what to make of it. The scares are well-done, this movie focuses most of its efforts on crating an atmosphere of wrongness rather than having the ghost come out and yell ""boo"" at the audience. In fact, Polly is more pitiable then malevolent, the horror coming from the idea that haunting a house is equivalent to being trapped in a self-made hell created by her own traumas. The movie also establishes early on that Lilly is going to die at the end, creating a sense of impending doom as we wait for her inevitable end.Unfortunately, this is somewhat undercut by Ruth Wilson's performance which I found bizarrely off-putting. I hesitate to blame the actress when this could just as easily be a directorial choice but her Lilly seems oddly wooden. In the scenes where she's asked to engage in dialogue, rather than narrate, she seems to be reading off a script rather than actually having a conversation.In addition, she seems to talk and act like someone from decades before the movie actually takes place. The film is set in the past but we see characters watching a VCR at one point meaning that, at it's earliest, the film is set in the late 1970s. I have trouble believing that even that far back anyone under the age of 40 used phrase like ""Heavens to Betsy"" in actual conversation or referred to themselves as a ""Silly Billy"". Unfortunately, the leading performance is distracting which undercuts, but ultimately doesn't completely undermine the atmosphere of dread the film works to build. It's a good movie which could have been a great one with a better central performance."
" I was a fan of this one
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,7,Its not a typical jump scare horror flick. Its atmospheric. Like watching her in the house made me creeped out and uncomfortable.It was a nice change from whats out there. So I think cinematic fans apply here. Casual horror fans need not.
" Has potential to be so much better!!
",2019-07-30 00:00:00,6,"The way of filming, the audio and the plot was amazing. The build up was even better! Then, when you thought it would unravel, the movie ended :("
" A slow good story
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,8,"The story unreveals itself slowly, which I liked. ""Something happens"" aprox 80min into the movie. Cinematography is good, it's though thrpu and enjoyable. I'd love to read it as a book."
" Dull As Dishwater
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,1,"Probably the worst movie that Netflix has ever made. Even the ghost effects were cheap. Boring script, irritating actress playing an irritating character. You feel nothing for her or the other character, so a complete pointless waste of celluloid"
" Couldn't wait for the end

" Predictable slow waste of time
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,2,"I just lost 1 hour and half of my life watching this.
Movie had everything to be good: good photography, good actors, good suspense moments.... what the hell went wrong?
99% of the movie I was waiting for something to happen. When the suspense was building up, the narrator's voice ruined everything... again.. and again... and again.
Slow paced, pointless, boring script with a very predictable ending.
What the hell was in the producer/director's head, I don't know. It's like having all the tools to make a classic and instead they ended up with a bland, shallow example of ""watching paint dry"" moment.
What a waste."
" ?
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,1,"The people who gave this movie a good rating need help.
It was painfully slow, had no actual story and wasn't even scary.
Waste of time. Kinda like ""the Witch"". I can't believe movies like these have such good ratings when they are pure garbage!
If I wanted to see ""art"" I'd just visit a museum, this was just needless."
" It's not that bad or good
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,6,"Boring seems to be overriding theme of the low reviews and poetic, mesmerizing the highs and it is neither and both. It could have been amazing but it isn't that it's slow or boring, it lacks substance and depth. It's like a long trailer for a movie you wish you could see. It could have been wonderful. Imagine reading the spark notes for a great novel, and then not having access to the novel. Disappointing."
" Creepy and atmospheric
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,9,"The 'thinking person's' ghost story.
I can't understand the poor reviews of this excellent film, but I assume these reviewers have a low attention span and tend to get bored easily. To claim ""nothing happens!"" is absolute rubbish and a sad indictment of some of today's instant gratification society.
If you're after a fast-paced ghost story with cliched jump scenes, loads going on, and everything spelled out for you, you won't probably won't enjoy this film.
If you prefer a slow burn atmospheric film which gradually gets under your skin and leaves you thinking about it for days after then give it a go.
I knocked off a star as some of the backstory could have been developed further, but overall this is a masterpiece of building a chilling film full of a sense of dread."
" Tries to be like Edgar Allen Poe, but fails
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,3,"The other reviews are right. This film is dunked in mood, with great cinematography, and creepy monologues. It is like a poem that tries to be similar to Poe, but unlike Poe, there is no payoff for waiting till the end. It really is an awkward woman walking around a house, having awkward conversations with her patient, her boss, and herself. There are all the elements of a good horror story: creepy house, creepy senile old woman, creepy music, and even a ghost. But the writer did hardly anything with it. It was like watching a cryptic poem that no one really wanted to decipher and discuss."
" Great movie..... to fall asleep.
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,1,"So horribly slow and tediously bad.
I can safely say it's one of the worst so called horror movies I've ever seen.
The lines are probably meant to be really poetic, but miss any real quality.
If they made a 20 minute version of it, it might even be bearable, but alas."
" If...you...like..to...watch...slow... motion...this pretentious piece of junk is for you.
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,1,"I have never seen a slower movie in my entire life. It was dull!!! I wanted to high five myself for getting through the whole thing, but slap myself for even finding it at the same time. It tries way too hard to be deep and just ruins it with the slowest narration ever. If I could have watched this with subtitles on and put in slight fast forward motion, it might have been okayish."
" Loved it!
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,10,"Now let me start with this, you need to be in the right mood to watch this movie. And you need to not be expecting your average horror. This movie is very subtle, more atmosphere and storytelling than ghosts jumping up every which way. Ruth Wilson was very convincing.This is definitely not for everybody, if you're into the basic horror of Hollywood then you won't appreciate this one, but for the few who enjoy this sub genre this is quite the achievement."
" An admirable attempt but a failed one.
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,4,"A horror that's hard to hate since it does try to be different. It makes the cardinal error of actually being ABOUT a horror writer and seems to think that makes it OK to have these pretentious voice overs.There are some ""artsy"" moments that don't quite work for their incongruity and it never quite gets the tone it wants.It's very interestingly visualized though."
" Typical Perkins
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,2,As usual with Perkins the acting is excellent but the story is garbage and uninteresting. At the end of his films you're not even sure if what you just went through was meant to be entertaining or just a waste of time.
" I Wouldn't Bother If I Were You, But I'm Not
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,1,"I should have read the reviews more carefully, but I probably would have watched it anyway. I've seen some really good movies that had bad reviews. I think that this may be the first movie I've watched that had some great reviews, and was actually a real stinker. I'm thinking, for the first time, I want my hour and a half back. Not scary, not interesting, not even well-made. I found this movie to have no redeeming qualities whatsoever."
" I am the boring thing
",2019-04-12 00:00:00,5,The storytelling is quite dull and slow. Despite that the filmography is beautiful and deserves a spot in an art gallery. I only enjoyed it for the eye candy really.
" Gothic, boring.
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,1,"Oh my goodness, please read the other reviews on IMDB before you watch this. Do not make my mistake! This is very very literally a long poem turned into a movie.
One of the scenes container her opening a box (not looking inside a box--OPENING a box) for several minutes. In another, she finally sees the character who lived in the house before her (who was murdered by her husband(?) with a hammer for no explained reason?) and...she dies of fright. Literally grips her heart and dies silently from fright. None of the characters have any backstory, and not one death is explained? I kept waiting for some kind of twist, but it never came.
THE longest attempted suspense for every scene of any movie. This may be a staple of the Gothic genre, and could very well be above me, but this is not a movie to watch for pure entertainment."
" Slow and Broording and Wonderful
",2019-03-28 00:00:00,9,"If you're still not programmed by Hollywood to expect a cut every thirteen frames and are capable of paying attention to a slow, detailed, graceful telling of a story, you'll appreciate this film. The most negative reviews tend to agree that this film is bad because it is slow. For me, that's a plus. I think it's paced beautifully, and I adore the whole look, feel, and sonic atmosphere of it. Best enjoyed with candles and a glass or two of wine. The story does reveal a secret, and it's rife with mystery and gothic character and good acting.Don't watch this if you like the fast pacing of modern movies. Do watch if you enjoy patiently eking out the details of a mystery that unravels slowly."

" An exercise in booooooooredom. Suspense done wrong every step of the way.
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,1,One of the worst films I've ever seen. It's so slow I grew new gray hairs before it was over. A film that's 90 minutes shouldn't feel like it goes on for 5 excruciating hours. Endless takes of uninteresting narrating and static or slooooooooowly panning/dollying shots. The writer directed this pablum and was clearly in love with his own dialogue. Kill your darlings ffs! I've got mad love for Ruth Wilson. She's one of the most talented actresses working today. She won me over with The Affair (a show she completely stole every step of the way). One wonders what drew her to this garbage though. Easy paycheck? A starring role? Who knows. She's not bad but there's nothing here to work with. She plays a hospice nurse sent to take care of an old writer. Ghostly shenanigans happen. There was maybe one genuinely good suspenseful scene among all the extreme tedium. I got actual goosebumps when Ruth Wilson's character was on the phone and the ghost snatched it from her hands. That's the only well done scene in the film. A spectacular misfire every step of the way. I hope this writer/director never works again. He's that awful at his job. Shame on you! Avoid like the plague.
" Staring at the wall was more entertaining.
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,1,"I swear I don't think I've ever been so bored in my life. I was literally staring at a wall instead of the TV. My thoughts were more interesting. A successful movie is one that takes me away from my thoughts, the best movies are those that take me away and then stay in my head long afterwards. My boring and depressing thoughts were better than this movie. I'm honestly annoyed. I want to sleep now. Bye."
" Extreme boredom with intermittent banal narration
",2019-03-04 00:00:00,1,"Seriously, if I'd had the option to rate this a 0, I would have, and eagerly!
I always hesitate before watching anything in the ""horror"" genre cuz I can be a real baby if it's done well and scary.
This Is Not That.
Not even close!
To be honest, I'm not sure what the hell that was. Besides being - and here comes the cliché- a complete and utter waste of my time!
The plot was... thin, wispy, & irresponsible to say the least. At no point do you actually really figure out what the hell is going on - with Anyone! There's no depth to any of the characters whatsoever. Not the lead, Lily, a nurse who's come to give hospice care to Ms Blum, a sick, elderly, once successful author, of several books. We pass a year with Lily and know almost nothing about her except what she tells us herself in her opening narrative announcing herself to us.
Ms Blum, although mostly silent in her infirmary, gives us one mysterious monologue, and then sleeps through much of the film. Regrettable, since her life, or rather, the little we know of it, seems rife with interesting character development possibilities. Alas, a major loss which could have added depth and breadth to the film. God knows it needed something akin to a Hail Mary pass! Forgive me for not recalling the actresses name, but she's one you'd recognize and she's totally underutilized in this role. They could have used anyone for the minor part they gave her! She's capable of so much more; what a loss.
Even the Estate Mgr who delivers Lily on her first day to the residence and then comes back once to check on her, is a face. You'd recognize him. Again, a couple of tight-lipped words no more, in his first scene, and a short story in his second; both forgettable here but he's often used as a character actor and has excellent skills, so why cast him in a movie if you're going to basically give him the part of an extra?! One might think they'd negotiated some new pay structure with the actors based on how many words they say. What a novel, is stupid and misguided, idea!
I don't know who financed this but no doubt they lost their shirt on this project. I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall at that studio's final screening before everyone signed off on distribution.
I am usually a bit too easy on movies and try to give them and the actors the benefit of the doubt, but I'm not feeling a bit generous after this viewing. I mean, you've got to at least pretend to look like you're trying to make a real movie about something, or you're just screwing with we, the audience, aren't you? The very idea that some studio though people would actually want to pay their hard-earned cash to watch this... this... travesty of movie making tells me exactly what they think of us. Well back at you!
I don't know who they thought this would appeal to. Certainly not teens. Adults will just be pissed, like me, for wasting 2 hrs watching this drivel. I'd be surprised if more than one persons career didn't take a huge setback, if not a complete and total tank. Good god, what are they teaching in film school? This isn't even eclectic enough to be an artsy film. It's just worthless material.
You keep waiting, and waiting, and waiting (I did say extreme boredom!) for Something to happen, but what does happen is out of
There's so much good tv and movies out there, I don't think there's any excuse for this. This isn't the old studio system where you have to crank out so many a quarter or you're done.
Ok, you know what? I've wasted enough time on this and I'm putting it to bed. I'm not even going to proof-read what I've written. It's not worth my attention. So, sorry for any typos or auto-correct mishaps. Forgive me.
Just don't bite and try to forgive this Director, you hear me?!

It was so expertly well done that it left me breathless and I had to come on here to commend the cast and crew for this amazing experience.

" Read the Book

Unfortunately, this coincides with our inability to boast positive attributes about this film. Although we did not enjoy the film in its entirely, there are aspects about the film that works for those that enjoy the subtle clues, slow story-line, and cunning monologues.The protagonist, Lily, is hired to care for an elderly author in her large, lonely (haunted) house. With the film portraying a great murder-mystery author, Iris Blum, the film is written in such a way as if you were reading a novel yourself. Grasping onto every spoken word is key in this movie as that was where you could create some imagery around the stale shots. Or the many scenes that were practically black screens. Lily starts to realize she's not alone in this house gradually and this is facilitated by the fact that Iris refers to her as Polly. That may tip me off to something deeper going on, but Lily takes quite some time to find a connection. Polly is the main character in one of Iris' novels, ""The Lady in the Walls"" and from there the concept unfolds. We think this may have just been better left as a novel, or maybe even a podcast.Most likely to die of a heart attack: Iris Blum due to old age, however, good health Lily suffers from a heart attack killing her at the sight of Polly's ghost.Most likely to never watch this movie again: Us.Best hair volume: Iris Blum, at an old age, your hair is rockin'.Overall Grade.

" Unsure what happened
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,1,"Me finishing this movie is the epitome of the sunk cost fallacy. I'll start by saying my one star rating is more overrated then the missionary position. I personally rather get curbstomped while watching Nicholas Cage and Dwayne Johnson have an acting competition. This was the lowest budget, most astronomical waste of time I've ever seen. Me and my friend daughter out to watch a bad movie intentionally and yet this still disappointed. What happened to the classics like skyline and rubber? This movie seemingly found a way to even fail at being a bad movie. Not a good movie not a bad movie,what is it?.... abysmal. This is actually the first review I've ever left on IMDb. The movie was in fact that bad. Well I feel as if writing anymore is giving this movie undeserved attention.

To say anything more would spoil it, to say anything more would also be difficult as it's rather hard to explain.So as mentioned the visuals were great and the narration solid, sadly the visuals don't last and the narration isn't enough to save the film. Not even remotely.The film is certainly unique but I'm not quite sure who it'll appeal to, certainly not someone seeking a horror.

",2018-12-28 00:00:00,10,"This one is not at all your run-of-the-mill Horror film. It's precedent is the classic atmospheric Ghost Story, and if you somehow miss that, the writer of the script places it back neatly in front of you in the form of the foundational plot. There are no jump-scares to speak of, and recent companions of this film include THE INNKEEPERS, PRESENCE OF MIND, and THE LITTLE STRANGER--though none of these is a mirror image of I AM THE PRETTY THING... The IMDb ratings for this brilliant work of art show that not many people understand the story, but those of us who are Ghost Story aficionados understand it quite well, and add it to our list of classics such as the abovementioned films as well as THE OTHERS and THE CHANGELING.Mild language, if any.
No nudity or suggestive material to speak of.
Few if any jump-scares, and they are mild."
" Slow moving but worthy
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,6,"Osgood Perkins is more than the son of Anthony Perkins. Thanks to the film The Blackcoat's Daughter, he's announced himself as a force in modern horror. With I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House, he's invited comparisons to Lynch, Kubrick and Polanski, as well as a review that says that this film is ""the most atmospherically faithful adaptation ever of a Shirley Jackson book that never existed.""Iris Blum (Paula Prentiss!) was once a horror writer, but now she is suffering from dementia, waited on by her live-in nurse Lily Saylor (Rith Wilson from Showtime's The Affair). They are both alone in a house that was built by a man for his true love, but they both disappeared the day they were married.Lily's only contact with the outside world is the manager of Iris's estate, Mr. Waxcap (Bob Balaban, who you'd know from Christopher Guest comedies or Close Encounters of the Third Kind). As she spends her days and nights caring for her patient, the supernatural slowly takes over her life. Telephones are yanked from her hands, mold slowly grows on the walls and she has visions of that very same black mold infiltrating her body.Iris will only refer to Lily as Polly, the name of the character in the most famous of her thirteen books, The Lady in the Walls. Lily decides to overcome her averison to Iris's books and read that tome, learning that Iris may have known Polly, but every vision we see of the girl tells us that she was a bride in 1813 and walked the house blindfolded while her husband watched. That's when Lily finds the rough draft for the book, in which she learns that Polly was murdered by her husband and stuffed into the very same wall where the mold grows.Lily tries to discuss the book with her patient, who claims that Polly has betrayed and left her before telling her that even the most pretty things rot. While Lily tries to watch television, Polly's ghost (Lucy Boynton, The Blackcoat's Daughter) visits Iris before making sounds throughout the home. Lily investigates, only to see the boards of the walls have been removed. It's then that she finally sees the ghost face-to-face and dies of a heart attack.Years later, when a new family moves in, there's a new pretty thing inside the walls. Now, Lily roams the house.I'd compare this film to 2017's A Ghost Story, but with much better pacing. It truly depends on the strength of its actors, who rise to the occasion, to keep the story moving. And the cinematography by Julie Kirkwood (who also worked with Perkins on The Blackcoat's Daughter) is exquisite, a match of perfect softness and dark doom. I'd definitely recommend this movie to anyone that has the patience to savor its elegiac and languid pace."

While it sucked me in, it is not the kind of movie everyone will like. If the first ten minutes aren't completely entrancing as they were for me, it's really not going to get better for you.To those who love the poetic and gothic feel of this film, you are not alone in your respect and awe at this story."
" 4.6 are you kidding?
",2018-11-01 00:00:00,8,"I found this to be a very impressive film. It is a film that evokes a certain mood rather than being dependent on story, and I think it does it rather successfully. I was genuinely shocked when I saw this only had a 4.6 rating, as I think it is definitely a worthwhile watch. Not only is it successful in unsettling the viewer but I also found this to be very chilling, and unreliant on jump scares which a well made horror film doesn't need. I can only assume that this has found the wrong audience. Overall a really well made haunted house film."

",2018-10-10 00:00:00,2,"The movie was terrible, but every time they cut to the kitchen scenes the chair upside down on the wall hung there like a champ. Now in most scary movies that chair would fall and likely add to the story line, but this chair knew what it was doing. It knew it had a job to do and that was to keep everyone anxiously waiting for it to fall and it never did. It is safe to say this upside down chair deserves an oscar for best on screen performance. ****SPOILER****** The chair never falls."

We all got excited to see what looked like a chair upside down hanging from the ceiling Poltergeist style but it's always there, like a wall furnishing. And nurse Lily? In real life she seems like she'd be a sweet, trustful lady. In a movie she's as boring as overdone toast. Why the hell was Polly blindfolded? All I could figure was some sort of sex game since two grown people don't generally play hide and seek. I would rather someone stomp my toes then try to watch this again. Never again NETFLIX will I trust your judgement. We tried ""Open House"" next, don't watch that either."
" I feel like I wasted an hour and half of my life.
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,2,"I like clever psychological thrillers/horrors but there's one catch to that, I feel like it has to be clever and secondly, be a tad scary. This film did neither for me. It just so happens that I'm writing this review while I'm watching it, it's 1:07 in and I'm already writing this review... there may be an explosive and impressive ending, if so then I'll adapt my review accordingly but so far, this film has been more boring then watching paint dry. I understand that the writers and director must have had the clear aim of making the film be more of a drama thriller without cheap jump scares and a slow story with an intriguing dialogue that tells us a story within a story based on book. I have a huge issue with how this idea was conveyed early on with the main character, who was scared at everything but the only thing weird and scary in the film was in fact her, which made it a bizarre watch; not scary or clever but bizarre. Straight away I noticed how colour of everything was rather dull, I'm assuming they did this for effect to try to empathise a coldness of the house but it didn't do anything for me, I felt it just made a boring film even more boring. I did tell myself around 20 minutes in that if nothing interesting happens soon then I should turn it off, unfortunately I didn't stick to my own advice. Nothing has happened yet apart from the ghost of a woman floating about (who I'm assuming is the ghost of the woman from the story who was murdered but I could be incorrect as my concentration might have gone from the lack of interest). I'm still working out what is actually happening in this film because I feel it might just be as simple as the main character discovering a body, could be wrong as I haven't finished watching it yet but if so, this film has built up for nothing. A great way of describing this film is the slowness of when she found the letters /notes in that box in the closet, you expect something is going to happen but all you get is who scared expression and fingers moving very very very slow, you expect a big surprise or discovery but all that happens is she closes the box. That was the slowest part of my life, they might as well of done that part in slow motion. Skip forward to around the 1.10 mark, you've got the extremely loud conjuring style music and you assuming something is finally happening, erm no think again; ghost disappears, screen goes black and it's back to the middle of the day. It's so frustrating! What's the point of that kind of build up with only 16 minutes left and nothing comes of it? The main character has all this weird stuff happen and it's like it didn't happen the next day? And the old lady who she's suppose to be caring for is only in perhaps 20% of the film, you'd think she'd be around more as she never leaves the house but nope. You just get a bunch of random shots of the house with a story narration as if the writers are trying to send us to sleep. When the man knocks on the door peering through the net curtain, we get the main character standing on the stairs staring at him for the best part of 5 minutes which seems like 2 hours and then once he's gone, she does her little walk about, doing slow stares around corners (presumably to build up suspense but all of it seems for one purpose, to waste time because of the lack of substance. I'm 1.19 in and now bodies have been discovered and taken away by an ambulance. Do I care? Not really. I feel as though, this film wastes the viewers time by doing nothing and expects to shock by the tiniest of moments. I'm not impressed by it. Don't get me wrong, to a certain kind of viewer, this film might even be interesting or a good watch but I just found it stretched out with zero content and the story could have been a lot more interesting. I gave it a 2/10 instead of a 1 just because I respect the storytelling from the main character but other than that, this film has little going for it. I wouldn't recommend watching this film not unless you have nothing better to do.(Oh and I'm sure the director was trying to do a Stephen King style film but I would rather watch Stephen king over this.) Film is under Thrillers, Psychological Thrillers section on Netflix but there's nothing 'thrilling' about it."
" Honest Review
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,2,"If you had watched this film without the music cues..... it would have been a much better film than witnessed. The sound design and music was extremely safe, genre-specific in a cliche way, and provided nothing new in the horror / suspense genre. This was the downfall of this film. The cinematography was interesting. The plot could have been ""indie-interesting"".... but the drones of boring sound and cliche Bernard Herrmann moments failed."
" Very classy but predictable and slow
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,8,The special effects and style of shooting was fabolous. The locations were eerie and Ruth Wilson gave an outstanding performance. The only thing that killed the movie for me was the pace. A horror film needs to move at a fast pace. The build up takes too long. Another aspect is the climax ; it is very predictable
" What?

" Not for everyone, but beautifully done!
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,9,This movie holds true to be in one of the most atmospheric and beautifully crafted movies I have ever seen. It is quiet to the point that keeps your awareness and the acting is so well done.
" An Overhyped Audiobook
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,1,"You could watch this movie without even looking at the screen, so therefore, didn't even need to be made into a film. The imagery is slow and lacking in interest. It's few interesting visuals are far inbetween, making it hard to sit through. It is a poem narrated and that's that. It lacks a clear plot. It's been brutally muddled down with flowery words and analogies. It stands out only because of its very pure gothic ideas. But the point of a film is for you to connect and feel for the characters, or maybe give you the itch to solve a mystery, maybe discover a truth. This movie asks no questions. It answers none. It is vague and unfocused besides aesthetics. The story has an obvious cycle, but its characters are horribly unrefined; they lack facets, making them feel tropey. A nurse, and a horror writer, the ghost of a young woman. They behave exactly as expected, with no quirks, with no personality. Their backgrounds are unclear and the viewer has no desire to connect with any. The mysteries of the house and its inhabitants are not led to or questioned. The viewer does not get curious because not enough happens. not enough information is clearly revealed. And last, but definitely not least, the same imagery is used over and over again. The girl passing across a black background blurry, Lily wandering the house, etc. At first, the monotony could be explained as an attempt to place the viewer in the shoes of Lily, who is stuck in an aging house as a hospice nurse, with no entertainment. But as the movie continues, and nothing happens, it becomes less of a ""Wow, this house is so quiet and prison-like"" and more into ""Wow, this movie is so damn slow"".If you like poetry, or if you want to feel extra cool watching a movie and recognizing gothic elements from your 9th grade english class, go for it. Because that's all this movie is good for."
" Terrific title, great atmosphere, nothing else
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,4,"This is a horror movie by and for people who think they are a little above horror movies. Framing is millimetre precise, plotting is minimal and the pacing is deliberate, *very* deliberate. It's like watching stalagmites form.The main problem is that for all its artiness this is basically just another horror movie: every element is there to be creepy and nothing else, no depth, no emotion, no other layers.And it is creepy, especially the opening moments with the image of a woman in Victorian clothes coming into shot, colours trailing like a slow-motion comet, her facial features smeared enough to make them indistinct. There is tension during the nurse's telephone call too, and at other moments, but it's not long before we begin to suspect that the extreme formality of the film-making is a cover for a lack of ideas.Couple of other problems: the SFX make-up is poor, and when the phantom manifests itself at a crucial point near the end it looks so ludicrous that the mood is ruined.Also, while it's great to see Paula Prentiss again, she actually looks too healthy for the role of a disintegrating old woman. I thought it was a sixty-year old actress trying to look twenty years older."
" Slow and Boring
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,2,"I was really expecting this to be a little slow, but oh my! This goes no where through out. It has no purpose, no entertainment, and no scares. I kept watching, thinking it had to get going at some point, but nothing ever happened and it just ended. Boring!"
" I Am Going To Have A Nightmare
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,3,"But not because the film was terrifying to any degree. Because it was so terribly inane and illogical. My eyes glued to the screen trudging along with the camera panning through Lily's glacially paced gait and shots around the house, I felt like I was watching a movie in slow-motion setting. My mind started to wander - I found myself wondering about mundane details like who is buying the groceries for this house for this petrified, annoying young woman seems too afraid to even step foot outside.Simply put, there is no plot to this movie. Oh I've read the other reviews applauding the film's supposed brilliance in 'storytelling'. Interestingly, there is not even a story to this film. If incompleteness and disjointed plot were a storytelling devices, this one gets a perfect score. What baffles me most is the praise that others are leaving about how this film is a breath of fresh air amidst the fast-paced, gimmicky, gory horror we're accustomed with today. HELLO!? This movie is on the opposite end of the same spectrum and the director RAN with it. The shots are drawn out and eerie music builds before things happen. The protagonist moves about slowly and stares for eternity at anything she finds to build suspense. I did not give this movie a 1 because I thought acting was fine and the cinematography was good. If that's what you're after, go to an art museum - you can spend the same amount of time and you migh even learn something.This was truly a heinous film.
I resent Netflix for this torture."
" Waste of time

" I Am The Underrated Thing That Lives In The House
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,7,"Whilst light on plot, this movie is hinged on an ironic-enough premise and positively drips with Victorian-Gothic atmosphere, thanks to its slow-burn, use of literary tropes, and its poetic narrative prose. A great performance from Ruth Wilson too. Unfolds like a classic English ghost story. Think 'Whistle And I'll Come To You Lad', or 'Turn of The Screw.' The Conjuring this ain't."
" I downloaded the IMDB app to leave this review.

I had been praying for the sweet release of death for over 70 of those minutes. If I ever get to Braintree, Mass I promise to burn this house to the ground in order to save the ghosts from the eternal hell that must be their torment, boredom."
" Lifts ""ghost story"" to a new level.
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,7,"This movie is about a woman who takes care of a writer who suffers from dementia. While taking care of her, strange things happen in the house, while her story draws a strange parallel to a story written by the owner of the house.It's understandable that people consider this movie boring. Not much happens, story-wise, character-wise, horror-wise, etc. The movie doesn't focus on an origin, explanations or effective scares, of which there aren't many. The movie does however deliver a message about life and transition.Death isn't the end. It's merely a continuation of life, sometimes caused by tragedy. Even in 'post-life' people want love, affection, recognition, and a place to belong. The lead actress transitions from life into post-life, from her own story, into the written story.The movie can be considered an abstract painting. It's not just about a start, a middle and an end. It focusses on a feeling, an emotion, an eternity caught in a moment of time. That makes the movie boring for some, art for others."
" Worst movie ever
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,1,The suspense isn't suspenseful. the plot is stupid. It goes NOWHERE. 1 hour and 29minutes of my life I'll never get back.
" Very artistic and genuinely scary
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,10,"This film is not your generic horror film. It is actually a work of art..it moves slowly and that makes it more interesting and suspenseful. I am surprised there are so many negative reviews when our family found this film thought provoking and beautifully made. I would guess the negative reviews come from those who expected a slasher or boring run of the mill ghost story which this film is not. There were some scenes that sent chills up my spine. My only complaint is that Paula Prentiss did not have more to do in the film. Other than that, I highly recommend this artistic piece of cinema."
" WATCH THIS FILM

" A bit different
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,5,"This is a spooky film and the director has done really well with creating tension. There's something quite gothic about it I think, like a traditional ghost story.The two main actors give good performances, there's not an awful lot of dialogue for them to work with, but they deliver it well. I thought Ruth Wilson was particularly good but really she had to be as she more or less carries the film. The narration throughout the film works well in making it creepier.It's just very slow and there's not enough happening to fill the almost 90 minutes. Knock half an hour off it and it would improve it hugely but then it wouldn't be a feature length film I guess. If you like a lot of action or sudden frights etc then this is not for you. Although I quite like the ideas behind it I couldn't bring myself to give it more than five stars because my attention was definitely wandering at times."
" LESS THAN 1 STAR
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,1,"Horrible, Horrible Movie! EXTREMELY SLOW and POINTLESS! If you reach the end of this quagmire, you will be incensed at the waste of your valuable time. I kept waiting to be pulled in but never was, I should have turned it off, but that's on me. I don't know anyone who liked this movie at all. Take my advice and skip it, just about anything is better to watch than this crappy movie."
" Slower Than Molasses in a Canadian Blizzard
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,1,"This movie was so truly abhorrent that I took not only the time to write this review, but the time to make an account with IMDB and then write my review just so others may avoid making the same mistake I did. Firstly, the plot of this movie is predictable. Within minutes you know both where the movie is going to go and where you'll wind up at the end. I watched from start to finish thinking the entire time it just isn't possible for this movie to go exactly as I think it will, and yet, after the painful hour and a half or so I watched, it ended exactly where I expected it would. Next, the movie lacks any pacing. Over the years I've watched plenty of well done movies that started slow, but as they approached the climax they sped up, and with many slower horror films the ever building tension leaves you quite satisfied with the foot dragging pace at the beginning. IATPTTLITH leaves you frustrated. From start to finish this whole movie drags for no meaningful reason. Finally, this movie lacks any appreciable depth. The script writer for this trash film never once thought to incorporate even the slightest bit of character development or even something as basic as seasonal setting changes despite the timeline stretching over what is presented as being at least 11 months. The whole environment the film transpires in feels flat. I sincerely don't understand how anyone gave this movie more than one star, and I'm almost certain the reviewers who found this to be some sort of Gothic style masterpiece must have watched a completely different film than the slow motion trainwreck I watched. If you're really in need of a way to kill time I'd skip this and just go watch the grass grow. I promise it'll be a far more eventful show."
" Wrong genre
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,1,"Should be a drama not horror. Wasn't scary at all. Good movie if you have trouble sleeping, it helps you sleep."
" Excruciatingly boring and a waste of time
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,1,"I can't even come up with a thorough enough description of the movie because there is nothing to even talk about. I kept waiting and waiting for something to happen, and when the background sound effects would reach some sort of peak, nothing would happen. Don't even bother with this movie."
" Full of dread or dreadful? Both? I don't know.
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,6,"I've seen many horror films that make me want to turn them off cos they're so crap but it's rare for me to see a horror film where the mood is so ominous and hangs so heavily that it becomes almost unbearable to tolerate and I mean that both as a compliment and as a criticism.I Am The Pretty Thing... sets out it's stall early. The main protagonist, Lily, announces via narration (like Lester in American Beauty) that she will be dead within a year. Her detached narration throughout reminded me of Linda Manz's in Terrence Malick's 'Days Of Heaven' but where that film shimmers with golden light, the events of this film weigh down on both Lily and the viewer like a dead weight. Part of the problem for me is the pacing. While investigating the standard creaks and bumps in the house and trying to find out why the lady she is caring for calls her Polly, Lily moves around the house at a snail's pace. At 84 minutes, this isn't a long film but it does feel like they padded a lot to get it to that length. Scenes crop up that could be flashbacks, flash forwards or dreams; it's hard to say. The film asks questions that it has no intention of ever answering and character development is minimal, to say the least. There are, however, pluses. Ruth Wilson has most of the film's screen time to herself and manages to do a lot without saying much or moving very quickly. Bob Balaban and Paula Prentiss do all they can with their limited time onscreen but the star of this horror film isn't the people, the ghosts or (as is often the case) the house itself (it is sparse but by no means a spooky place). No, the redeeming quality of this film is the sense of dread and foreboding that lasts for the entirety of the film. It never really lets up and despite the lack of a satisfying payoff and a couple of predictable horror tropes, the sense of being unsettled and on edge did stay until the credits rolled. It's not a film that will stay with me for long but it does have a feel all of its own and if you're a horror addict, it's worth a go. You may be bored to tears or you may sleep with the lamp on. 6/10"
" Am I missing Something?
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,3,"It appears a lot of people like this film, including some critics yet it feels completely uninspired to me. This film begins with a very lengthy opening narration which isn't particularly interesting. The first four minutes of this six minute monologue are spent staring at an out-of-focused woman in a white dress slowly turn her head towards the camera. This image is hard on the eyes since your eyes want to focus in on something but they cannot since the image is not in focus.This narration I thought was going to be delegated to just the opening of the film and the close (sort of like what we saw in Crimson Peak) but it is throughout the film. I feel that, for the most part, films that rely heavily on narration are bad films. Film is a visual media. There's the old saying of ""show, don't tell"" and films full of narration just don't really work for me generally. This film is no exception. The narration is also kind of unnecessary save for perhaps the very end and some of the opening narration. Though, at the very least it never again reaches the level of annoying and grating the opening narration did.As seen in the cover image, the ghost has it's torso and head facing the wrong way around. I never understood why this was. The story kind of explains it by saying the ghost turned slowly turned her back (both literally and metaphorically) on the old woman in the film until eventually she was the wrong way 'round. This explanation perplexes me and I don't think the ghost being like this added much to anything.I also do not understand why the ghost killed the protagonist at the end. There isn't really much of a motive as the ghost hasn't been shown to be malevolent. The ghost hasn't been shown to be anything really, it's just kind of there. I don't get what the ghost was trying to accomplish.In his masterclass on screenwriting, Aaron Sorkin says character are built on two things, motivation and obstacles. In this film we don't get motivation and so we can't get obstacles to stand in the way of the characters. This lack of motivation results in characters who are little more than props. We don't know the characters as a result and we cannot become invested.I tried to find any sort of motivation in this film for anyone but there is none to be found. The ghost doesn't want to solve her murder. The portagonist doesn't want to get out of the house alive because she doesn't realize there's a chance that isn't going to happen until the ghost kills her the moment it makes itself known. The old woman just sits at the window all day doing nothing. There are not motivations in this film. I thought we were going to get some form of character motivation when the protagonist started asking about what happens to the old woman's estate but that never went anywhere.Overall I would say this was a pretty terrible movie. Not as bad as that other Netflix horror movie I watched, ""Open House,"" still it was awful. I expect better from the network that gave us hits like Stranger Things, House of Cards, etc. The horror movies Netflix produces are some of the worst I have ever watched. The Netflix horror movies try to be experimental - the heavy narration and lack of motivation here and the decision to not reveal the killer or the killer's motivations in ""Open House."" This leads to films that can only be described as frustrating. Bad horror films usually leave me laughing or walking away feeling like at least I got a few jump scares. Both Netflix horror movies I have watched leave me feeling frustration and nothing more. They are the worst kind of movie imaginable."
" Didn't get it.
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,2,"A cheap confusing storyline with no ending. I didn't get it. The cast act very well, but other than that it was rubbish, a mishmash of a story that meanders and makes no sense whatsoever."

" An Awfully Underwritten Story
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,1,"I fell for this movie because it was mentioned that it was a 'slow-burner' and 'not-your-typical-hollywood-horror' kindda movie. All these signs made me think this movie was going to be awesome.
However, I soon found out that this wasnot the case for such movie. Yes, it nailed the atmosphere right, I will give it that. However, this movie fails on every other level; seriously. 
You see, there is a fine line between intentional vagueness in a story that is intended to urge the viewers to think, and the lack of story or plot altogether. I think the former is artistic, but the lattter is just lazy writing stemming from the lack of creativity. 
This movie touches briefly on some promising ideas of death and what it feels like being a ghost, but it really never delves deeply into any of them.
Alll in all, I felt this movie was a waste of time. The only reason you would wanna watch this movie is if you were someone writing a horror story and need some new ideas"
" Nothing pretty, nothing good. Very disappointing.
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,2,"I am actually speechless. I can't recall the last time a film tagged ""Horror"" succeeded in being so utterly unsatisfying and plain boring. Reading some other reviews I've realized that perhaps ""I Am The Pretty Thing That Lives In The House"" has a certain Gothic charm to it, sort of a Classical short-story come to life, but I personally wanted to watch a scary film, not complete a literature assignment.The acting is good I guess, for the shallow deliberately criptic characters (who do little to salvage this film from having confusion its sole effect, and not a confusion resulting from clever sophistication, but bred from a total mess and lack of ligic). The narration is quite impressive, sort of like a Poe tribute combined with early 20th century ghost stories, in which the assumed very existence of ghosts and their presence in a home was the epitome of fear. This is the 21st century and I personally require more than that.Seeing as how I've just spent 90 minutes watching this film waiting for something, anything, preferably an answer (even an implied one) to one of the many questions posed by the long, overbearing build-up. Did I say build-up? My mistake, as the term implies a conclusion, something at least mildly exciting to conclude the events and tie the hidden hints together. Here? No conclusion, no events, no logic, barely any story and nothing to make me personally feel like I've chosen the right film to watch.If you're an academic looking for an interesting analysis - look no further. But if like me you're simply a Horror enthusiast looking for a scary film - look elsewhere. Anywhere. I have work tomorrow, I need to go get some sleep and I can't put into words the utter disappointment I feel having wasted my time on this film."
" Nope.
",2018-06-13 00:00:00,2,"It is a long, slow, boring movie. I felt no horror, didn't like the main character as well. I had high hopes reading the sum, but it turned out to be a real disappointment. I liked the photography though and the sound was a bit spooky. But that's all. Doesn't worth the hype."
" Pretentious!
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,1,"This movie was a waste of time! 
I feel like it was made by those pretentious art students who throw anything together, call it art, then make up some crap about what it means. Just for the other pretentious folk to say ""oh I totally get it! The emotions! So intense!""
The biggest yawn ever. Just a bunch of pretty shots. It would have had more impact if it was cut down 3-4 minutes and used as a music video!"
" Watch the blackcoats daughter instead!
",2018-06-11 00:00:00,1,"Coming off the directors previous movie the blackcoats daughter, a film that tormented me and kept me from sleep for days! I wanted this one to be just as good, but boy was I lead astray! There wasnt a frightful thing in this movie! I never under any circumstances fall asleep during movies, I give every one the benefit of the doubt, but I found myself nodding in and out the entire time. I recomend you skip this movie all together and just watch blackcoats daughter!"
" This movie is the reason I cancelled my Netflix subscription!
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,1,"I can't say too much about this movie as I don't want to waste any more time on it than I already have but, forget the glowing reviews you see for it on IMDB because they are either placed there by the production team or by people who have far too much time on their hands.To say this movie is slow would be a gross understatement. It's almost coma inducing. The actors are fine and they do what they can with what is given to them but therein lies the problem. The story such as it is could have been condensed into around 10 minutes and nothing would have been lost. It is not even an interesting story and the premise has been used many times over in the past. I would strongly suggest you watch the first 10 minutes and then look for something else because it really doesn't get any better after that. If your waiting for something to happen you will need to give it 1hr and 29min until the end titles roll...THAT is the most exciting part of this movie."
" The scariest thing about this move is how much it can test your patience.
",2018-06-08 00:00:00,2,"This movie, as many people have said before, is just way too slow. I was genuinely intrigued about the story, but as the movie droned on, I stopped caring. It was so frustrating watching a slow zoom on one single image for like a whole minute. The narration was super slow, and even the actress moved really, terribly slow.
I think this is really sad, because I actually really enjoyed the plot of the movie. The introduction was pretty intriguing, and I felt that the story line was not too cliche. If this film moved faster; it would have actually turned out to be a great. Quite disappointing."
" 244. I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House
",2018-06-08 00:00:00,7,"A cool creepy story about, well its more about a house than anything else, or more like the creepy things that go on in it. It starts with the arrival of a home care nurse named Lily, and she's there to care for Iris Blum, a horror novelist nearing the end... And seeing that Lily is the ultimate scaredy-cat, moving into an big, very old house, occupied by a horror writer, well seems weird. But Lily goes for it, and as she cares for Iris, Iris starts calling her Polly... a character from one of her novels, The Lady in the Walls, her best known work. Once Lily checks it out, the creepiness begins. I thought it was a good piece of story telling, it splinters off, and tells the tale of Polly, and also the tale of young Iris writing the book... How all three stories intersect was pretty sweet, and a uber creepy narration helped on the creepiness factor of creepy. Filmbufftim on FB."

",2018-05-21 00:00:00,4,The characters are great they're very believable and fitting but the story is very slow which might not be a problem except it's a little artsy fartsy (not as bad and ridiculous as the shape of water *that was a bad movie) and maybe most frustrating of all is quite a few unanswered questions and open-ended developments.
" Unfulfilled potential
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,1,"This movie has great potential to be a horror classic but it just massively undelivers, nothing actually really happens. The whole time you're waiting for the story to unravel but it never does. The upside down chair on the wall is the scariest thing in this movie!"
" This movie made a 2 hour flight feel like 4 hours
",2018-05-11 00:00:00,2,"I watched because of the lead actress. I enjoy the her combination of strength and vulnerability she brings to most of her roles. But this was simply boring and rote. I like gothic horror. I don't mind a quiet slow pace, if the story is strong it can build intensity...but this felt like a lightweight short story that never should have been filmed."
" Boring!
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,1,I had high hopes for this film as it looked really interesting from the trailer but honestly it was terrible. Too drawn out and left me feeling very disappointed.

Not happy at the end that I spend 90 minutes on a flick were nothing is scary or let's say has anything to do with horror. The only thing happening is an axe going for a head but just for the hit it's over to the next sequence. Very slow moving so-called horror with nothing to see, bad bad bad.

" Ugh...
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,1,"I'm sure there's this huge, artistic, symbolic meaning behind this movie, but to classify it as a ""horror"" movie is a massive stretch. Sure, there are dark undertones and tense moments, but other than that, this movie is just... boring. Nothing particularly scary happens, and the whole time, you never know what's even going on. The ending falls flat, just like the whole movie. This is the worst movie I have ever watched, no question. Avoid this at all costs."
" slow, boring
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,1,"I did my best to force myself to continue watching this movie because i am the type of person who hates not finishing things (ie. books, tv series, movies, etc.)I wish i could get back every minute of my life i spent on this movie. The story line itself would certainly make a good book but the movie was so off-kilter, so slow and there was never any part in it that made me feel even the smallest bit of trepidation or anticipation. Lackluster is about the best adjective i can even conjure up at this moment in regards to this ""movie"".I think the writers and producers have potential but this is not one of their pieces of work i would put on any of their resumes. Ofc, these are only my humble opinions of which i am sure nobody here bothers to read nor gives a crap about. Good day to all."
" It successfully kept me in suspense the entire way through
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,7,"I thought I'd write a review to contrast all the bad ones on here haha. I hate horror films that resort to obvious ghosts, cheap scares and gore - that ruins it for me and makes it not scary. So I'm always on the hunt for a horror that actually scares me. This film absolutely does not resort to those tricks I hate, and it kept me in a paranoid suspense the entire way through. It's a subtle and clever horror, although I will admit it wasn't perfect. Something was slightly off about the storyline I guess. But how it was filmed - and the pace - was brilliant. It will genuinely haunt me I think :-)"
" Slow
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,2,"As a lover of art and poetry , I appreciated what this movie was trying to achieve but I disagree with most of the positive reviews on this movie. My expectations were perhaps too high? The main actress did not "" sell"" her character well at all and the lines seemed forced. Inconclusive and disappointing."
" Eh..
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,2,"In my opinion, the writers had an amazing concept but did a terrible job of brining it to life. It is extremely obvious when things were left out due to laziness and when things were added as an attempt to mask the laziness. While the movie was extremely slow, I understand why it was and I would not have minded it, had the writers provided us with more answers. Unfortunately, there is so much ""left to interpretation"" that one can't interpret it. The only thing that remains clear throughout is that Polly was murdered and because she died so tragically her spirit never left this earth. However, we are never given any clues as to why she was murdered. We are told it was by her new husband but why?? What has she done that would push him to do something like that, especially for the time period given how extremely religious society was. Or, on the contrary, was he a very disturbed man who masked this until he snapped?? We have to be given some sort of clue considering this type of thing does not just happen. I suppose these answers would have been unveiled in Iris's book (or the letters Lilly found but that scene went nowhere and acted more as a filler when it could've disclosed extremely valuable information) but the main character, Lilly, cannot bring herself to read it. Which is extremely frustrating considering it would've provided so much context to the story. Another thing I am confused about is: why exactly Polly opened up to Iris. I presume the house had occupants before her, it was never stated otherwise, so why Iris? What made her stand out or what did she do to receive this information? Her character could've even unveiled this at some point but we hear little from Iris. Which I also had a problem with. I understand she is sickly, Lilly is the main character, and Lilly is dead while narrating this, but Iris is still a hefty part of the story. It is her house and she is the carrier of this information so giving her more dialogue might've been a good thing for the plot. Lastly, I am so completely and utterly confused by Lilly's death. She scares easy, I get it, but I don't understand how the sight of Polly could've caused her to go into cardiac arrest given that she's seen the apparition before (take the scene where she is trying to find a working tv channel as an example). Her death seems more like a cop out. A way to wrap up the movie without putting any effort into it or adding any sort of depth. I'm just very disappointed overall as the movie had so much potential and went absolutely nowhere."

" Missed opportunity, this could have been gripping.
",2018-03-02 00:00:00,5,"Gothic horror is such a dismally overlooked genre, so many fascinating concepts to draw in, many many tales, so when one comes along, such as this, my curiosity and anticipation were high. Definitely positives can be taken, it is beautifully told, Ruth Wilson is a superb actress and story teller. The production values are strong, the story intriguing, but, those strong elements are somehow given a disservice by the execution, the delivery is meant to be slow deliberately, but is done in a way that makes the film boring, annoyingly it never seems to come to life, and the ending is woefully inadequate. Maybe my expectations were too high, this was disappointing. 5/10"
" Pretty thing with no substance and no payoff
",2018-02-19 00:00:00,3,"Beautifully filmed, wonderfully acted, perfectly cast, fantastic lines... with no story to flesh them out... Bare bones that won't give you a chill, let alone a scare, this story never rises above potential, never closes its grasp around anything substantial. It creeps, it spreads, it hints, it teases but there's no monster here... all walls with no foundation.Enjoy it for the aesthetics if you have the time to kill... but it will not stay with you."
" I Am The Only One, Who Was Not Bored By This Movie.
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,10,"This movie is not for those who are used to fast paced, break neck horror. This is more for those who are familiar with and enjoy Gothic literature. If you don't enjoy penny dreadfuls or the dark romantics, you will not enjoy this movie. (Not to say there's anything wrong with that, everyone has their own tastes. I'm just saying this movie won't be for you.) If you aren't watching closely enough, you may miss important details. I understand why this movie is getting negative reviews, because people came in wanting one thing and left with another. But, the movie itself is beautiful. It's color palette and cinematography are to die for, and the writing in the movie is superb. The acting is just on the right side of subtle, and the quiet atmosphere really drew me into a false sense of security, only to push me out of my comfort zone.The story, at it's core., is about Polly Parsons, a young bride who is murdered and 'buried' behind the walls of the home her husband built for her. She begins to tell her tale to writer Iris Blum, who turns it into a national best seller. Iris tries to communicate with the ghost again, only for Polly to go silent and literally turn her back on her. ""You turned your back so often, you're feet were facing the wrong way round."" Over the years, Iris deteriorates. She wants to die in her home, with Polly. Lily (yes, I did do the thing where I screamed ""oml dats my name."") comes in as her hospice nurse. Lily begins to uncover these stories, only to die of fright as soon as she sees Polly. She stays in the house, effectively becoming Polly. The symbolism in this movie is strong. No details are just put in there by accident. Iris and Lily, wilting like flowers. The mold that is Polly destroys them. *.* Like I said, if you enjoy the 'My House is Haunted By Demons' genre, but in the vein of 'The Amityville Horror' or 'Oujia' then maybe skip this one? (Of course, this isn't the only genre you're allowed to enjoy. You can enjoy this movie and those as well.) Otherwise, put your looking googles on. This gon' good."
" Poetic, Haunting, Pretty Thing
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,10,"Compared to the products of magical thinking made by some filmmakers nowadays, «I Am the Beautiful Thing That Lives in the House» (2016) is a masterpiece of poetic tone and circumspection, of elegant visualization and aural gentleness, in which there is one or two frights so as not to ""betray"" the genre, but in which restraint reigns. Ghost movies laden with effects of all kinds and blocks of tension that lead to nowhere, abound and win the applause of audiences in search of quick thrills. In contrast, there are few products like this film by Osgood Perkins (son of actor Anthony Perkins), which tells the story of how young nurse Lily Saylor (Ruth Wilson), who comes to care for the elderly writer Iris Blum (Paula Prentiss) in her Massachusetts home, begins to feel the presence of the ghost of Polly (Lucy Boynton). Pretty Polly wanders by the property, modifies and deteriorates it. It is one of those spirits of folklore and tradition that had a tragic and violent ending in an environment, which they resist to leave and end up owning places that they ""haunt"", unleashing strange events. However, in this case, the confrontation of the nurse with the ghost, with her employer (who insists on calling her Polly instead of Lily) and the memories that filter through corners and closets, consists of beautiful shots of the three characters, rich self-reflections in subtle linguistic metaphors that evoke yearnings, fears and precautions, and in bright shots of the house itself, which is also a protagonist. They all lead us to a tragic resolution we expect, because there are no intrigues or mysteries: from the beginning Lily announces that she is 28 years old and that she will not reach 29. In the midst of these reflections of images and sounds, realism surges every now and then, in the scenes of Lily with the guardian of Iris Blum's state (Bob Balaban) and with Blum herself, who affirms that her most famous novel was dictated to her by its protagonist, a certain Polly Parsons, that one day disappeared for good. To the commendable technical work and Perkins' screenplay and direction, you have good performances by Ruth Wilson, Bob Balaban and Paula Prentiss, in a brief comeback to films. There are also subliminal autobiographical notes in the film: in the beginning, Perkins dedicates it to his father, ""who gave me an old house""; he adds Perkins' rendition of Irving Berlin's song «You Keep Coming Back Like a Song» to the soundtrack, and shows the actor in a scene from William Wyler's film «Friendly Persuasion» on television. In addition, he cast Prentiss and Balaban, two old friends of his father who worked with him in the film adaptation of Joseph Heller's novel «Catch-22». After its premiere at the Toronto Film Festival, where it had a warm welcome, «I Am the Beautiful Thing That Lives in the House» was launched by Netflix as a Halloween offer. It was rejected by TV viewers who prefer ghost movies, filled with violence, humor and gore. However, I hope that the film will eventually gain the right place it deserves, as an artistically accomplished ghost story of impeccable execution."
" Shallow At Best
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,2,"The only thing I can say for this film was that it was pretty. The actresses (while all fairly similar in appearance) were all very pretty. The house was gorgeous. The moments that stood still felt just like a photograph. The colors, while not usually my forte, were all very lovely. It was as if everything that went into this piece went entirely into making it visually appealing. I thought about turning it off a few times but the visuals were quite nice. There was also this promise at the beginning of the movie of this theme of cycling in life and the quiet shock of an abrupt end in that cycle. I wanted to see that play out. In those two aspect, it was perfect. It was perfectly pretty and it didn't make promises it couldn't keep.That's the only thing I liked about it and that is not enough for me to give it more than two stars. The primary reason for that is because I found the main character/narrator to be insufferable. She was incredibly shallow. I would like to start with Lily's vanity. There isn't a single moment in the entire movie in which she expresses concern for anyone other than herself and she is a hospice nurse. Her entire job is to take care of a woman in her last days and all she can think about is herself. She came off as hesitant to even be in close proximity to her patient even after living with her for nearly a year. Through her narration, you could see that she only thought about the world in relation to herself and nothing more. Due to that egocentric mindset, it was hard to watch the scenes were she simply stared into the camera. There are more scenes like that than necessary with more than one character, but because of the way Lily narrates and seems to see the world, it's like staring into the eyes of a sociopath. There is an absence in her eyes that is actually a little unsettling. I blame that entirely on the narrative because the actress really seemed to give it her all. I didn't get that feeling from any other character in similar shots. Iris felt either curious or jaded, depending on her age. Polly was generally more sad. All in all, it was like none of that registered to Lily because she was the only person that mattered to her.As for the pacing, I like Gothic and Victorian literature, which is what I have seen this film equated to in other reviews. Maybe other people got that feel from what they heard and saw. I can kind of see it in the pacing in this movie, but both Gothic and Victorian literature had more oomph to their delivery or their message. I have yet to find a Gothic or Victorian piece of literature that didn't have a strong message or at least something more gripping than ""everything is pretty"".If I had to equate what I watched to poetry, I would say it was more akin to the Romantic Age.Here's the thing, I didn't find it incredibly interesting as a poetic piece. All of the descriptive language qualified as fluff. It was pointless. It made me roll my eyes more than it contributed to the atmosphere. The setting, the stylized clothes, and the unique ways these characters came together was enough atmosphere. Lily's pointless babble (which is evident in the dialogue of every single character in the movie) was pretentious. There is a part where Lily says that she always wears white because it shows everyone, patients and herself alike, that she can't be touched by darkness. There is a part where she describes every season she lived through in the house despite the fact that we didn't see any evidence of it. At the beginning and the end, she makes a broad claim on the house she died in, merely because she died there. It was all delivered in this descriptive prose that added nothing to the story, and in fact took away from the more interesting pieces that were never explored.We barely learned anything about anyone. We didn't get much information on Polly. We got next to nothing on Iris. As for Lily, she literally could have been a sheet of paper. She had at least one friend. She almost married someone named Scott. She didn't like any of Iris Blum's books and could barely read one ""scary"" story by the dying woman in the room near hers. She doesn't like mold. Ta-Da. That is Lily. If we couldn't elaborate on a murdered woman or an author that wrote down a ghost's story, why couldn't we at least have a main character with a little depth?These last items are going to be a little nitpicky but if they didn't exist, I feel like I could have provided this film with at least three stars, maybe four. I would like to say that all the names felt in movie felt just as shallow as Lily came across. I believe they were trying to make a parallel with the two floral names, Lily and Iris. I'm cool with that and I like the names individually, but paired with all the other names listed, it was like the writer didn't put any thought into it. It was like picked two flower names to make that parallel then just plucked every other name off the top of their head. The air of creativity they had with their extensive prose and their chosen location of Braintree, MA was completely lost on their name choices. Individually, I'm not saying any of the names were bad. It was just that any name mentioned felt like it was an afterthought and subsequently made them feel unimportant. There's Polly. She didn't give us any depth to her so she might as well be the doll with the same name. At one point she names some flowers Susie, Sally, Candice and Jane. They were names off the top of the character's head, which is exactly how I felt that the characters were named in this movie. Even the street name felt basic, like the writer looked slightly to their right, saw a teacup, and said that the house was on Teacup Lane. I found it upsetting because it reminded me of how little depth I was experiencing in the movie.I also had an issue with Lily's glasses. Why was she wearing them? Why did she bother to have glasses? She took them off every time she tried to see something more clearly. The glasses were pointless. All in all, this film delivered what it said it would and nothing more. I wouldn't ever watch it again. If I didn't deeply adore ghost stories, I would regret ever watching it."
" Where To Begin With This?
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,4,"First, I'd like to point out that I made an account specifically to review this film. And, unlike some people who do that just to leave a one star review with no details, I did this because this movie intrigues and baffles me. I knew what I was in for, a slow burn, psychological horror movie that would have more of a scary setting than scary actions. I have seen some people say that those who enjoyed The Witch would get more out of this film than others, and I can agree to an extent. I may have gotten more out of this than one star reviews, but I'm still unable to give this a positive score.From the opening scene, I knew I was in for something different. The character's monologue spoken as some sort of off-kilter poem, the blurred visuals of a ghostly figure, the pinpoint camera view where you seem to be viewing the scene through a fogged peephole, it was all very interestingly set up. As a scene changes and the main character proclaims that she had just turned 28, but will not make it to 29, I lost a bit of intrigue. But, if I were to go into detail with this movie scene by scene, you would be reading this all day. The movie has a great idea of tone, especially since it is not going for a scare that is easily obtained. It wants you to feel the creeping dread that Lily, our main character, is subjected to while living in this house, taking care of an elderly former writer. And in some instances, it succeeds. The consistent thumping of the pipes (or possibly spirits) in the walls drove me slightly mad in a way that seemed intentional. But what drove me mad unintentionally was the writing for the main character. She speaks, in equal measures, like a typical woman of 28, and like Annie Wilkes from Misery if she was sincerely as innocent as she feigns. She goes on to call her friend a slut in one scene (which contains a ""scare"" involving a telephone cord), and then refers to herself several times as a ""silly billy"" who shouldn't be terrified of the written words of her charge. In either case, the delivery seems odd, like she was given the opposite direction for the line to be spoken. The movie refuses to pace itself in a way that makes any sense. Lily will walk at a snail's pace in an attempt to set a nervous and unsettling tone, but merely comes off as if she's an undercover geriatric. Then, when you think the movie has given up on any obvious scares (which could be an alright choice in a film such as this), there's a moment of body horror, a moment of a jump scare, an intense crescendo of music when the rest of the movie could be considered quiet by a church mouse. It's almost as if the movie either became bored with itself, or knew that it would need something palatable for a trailer should one ever be made. But, if this was going for an artsy vibe, it would've benefited greatly from the removal of typical jump scares that seem to destroy the intent of the film. This movie is proof that, in some instances, you can make an astonishingly beautiful film that just does not have an understanding of when to yell ""Cut!"". The cinematography, while not flashy, has a great way of invoking the emptiness of the house and the loneliness in Lily's job and life. But the way the director attempts to keep this uncomfortable feeling high is by zooming in on the same empty door over and over again, by constantly going to fades to black when the scene really could end more efficiently, by keeping the camera in a peephole view and having Lily whisper about ghosts. Honestly, this review is probably as jumbled as the movie feels to me. I wanted to enjoy this film, and some parts come up more favorably in retrospect. But if there was one thing that brought down this movie for me, it was the pacing of the tone-setting. The problem is, that overlong shot of a hallway that's meant to instill fear is what brought this movie to slightly under 90 full minutes, so it almost feels like it would've been dead on arrival otherwise. Suffice to say, this movie needed more to talk about if it wanted to be as long as it was."
" Ridiculous waste of time
",2018-01-26 00:00:00,1,"What a colossal waste of an hour and a half! Slow, pained hospice nurse walks around from room to room looking scared and constipated at times. Some mold grows on the wall and probably on the poor viewers as they struggle to get thru this terrible cinematic farce."
" Why?
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,1,"This movie had a little promise at the beginning when it came to the monologue and such. But after that it was a steep decline. Too be honest, I could not focus solely on this movie and inevitably began searching clothing sites to buy time until the movie ended. The pace was crazy slow, nothing happened, not even a jump scare and the main character just always looks confused. And to top it off, she dies from fright...the ghost didn't have an intention to harm her, it just sort of stood there just as confused as the audience."
" Tried and true ghost story.
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,10,"This is an incredible ghost story. Minimal blood and gore. Pure and simple story telling from the perspective of the shade. Many will think it is dry, dull and lame. But this is what film making and story telling is meant to be. A nice homage to Lovecraft and other turn of the century story tellers. It works on many levels. Camera angels, shading and form. Brilliant but not pretentious."

",2018-01-07 00:00:00,1,Five minutes of the film was taken up by a woman opening a box. Kept going till the end thinking there must be something amazing coming because surely no one can make a movie based on this. Clearly they can one woman walking around a house narrating herself repetitively!
" As Boring As You Think
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,4,"I must say, the name of this film is fair, it truly is a pretty movie. In some ways it reminds me of similar movies such as Melancholia however it is extremely slow moving even compared to that movie. The movie begins with dialogue which never ends, in fact just about the entire movie is dialogue from the main character, Lily. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but truthfully the lack of action and explanation for anything in the movie gets to be boring after awhile.As other users might've mentioned, the movie does have its charm and I'll grant it that. It was interesting to watch though it really felt more like I was listening to an audiobook. The lack of dialogue and direction in the movie actually had me looking up explanations to the ending online when it didn't seem to make any sense to me. I finished the film dissatisfied and bored, while elegant and certainly pretty, soul and thought provoking it certainly won't give you any night thrills or nightmares. It's a softer, prettier version of horror than I'm used to and the film almost sounds like a poem. Thoughtful and riddled with worry but not scary by any means.For what the movie was I thought it did okay, certainly not the best and I feel as though those quiet moments were milked a little too long and any moments that were actually supposed to be frightening in some manner flopped. I will say that I never felt the urge to change the movie, I was certainly intrigued and wanted to finish what I'd started but the lackluster ending was the killer to my patience for this film."
" Slow, slow, slow
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,5,"And tedious. I enjoy movies that start slowly and build tension as the protagonist learns creepy things about his or her surroundings. This movie was not one of those movies. Certainly, it had potential. The first few sentences of the script were intriguing--but honestly, I put little stock in stories that start out ""and this is how I died"" any longer.The main character, the nurse Iris, meant nothing to me during the movie. She was completely uninteresting, even though we knew the character was 28 and would not live to see 29. She did not go into her illness, we did not understand the purpose of the elderly being elderly or a writer--the story within a story could have been about any book by any writer.There were a couple of nice little jump scares and the telephone cord pulling the phone from the nurse's hand was an interesting bit too easily explained away. Being an English major, I did wonder if the cord was a parallel for Polly's umbilical cord, as Polly was introduced as being attached with it to her mother and the nurse was ""connected"" to the house by the phone cord (and both cords are shaped relatively the same). A bit heavy-handed, if it was symbolism, but that was the last that seemed symbolic or important.In the end, we have no clue as to why the writer died or why the nurse died--or if ""we"" did, I certainly didn't, as the movie failed to hold my attention for any length of time. In any case, the movie was stylish and pretty to look at, but I wouldn't watch it a second time to determine what it was that I missed."
" What a waste of time
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,1,"How can anyone rate this more than 3 stars at best? Slowest movie I've ever seen, even at 2x fast forward. Cinematic, and got tricked by the freaky cover, but seriously a waste of time and not scary at all."
" The Windmills of the mind rotating on boredom
",2017-12-19 00:00:00,1,"The rule of thumb about writing, have a beginning, a middle and an end, thankfully this had an end. While others my consider this to be some modern take on Gothic literature and found it enjoyable, then they are easily pleased or have no understanding of the Gothic genre. The problem with the movie is it's a story within a story that we are never told, leading the main character to suffer from imagination is worse than reality syndrome. A total bore of nonsense that can only be described as an amateur attempt at at psychological thriller that fails on all accounts."
" takes a long time to go nowhere
",2017-12-09 00:00:00,3,"I am the sort of person in no way put off by the mood and tone of a movie like this, with lots of drawn out silence, lingering shots, and atmosphere to creep one out. The problem with this movie is it's apparently looking to make full use of that style of filmmaking, while not having much of a story to tell.it starts with a monologue from the main character that seems like it's going somewhere, but then starts to ramble, and you notice that it seems to be going on far longer than it should be. Once you think it's finished, it continues on, although at least we now see the main character, while she seems to struggle to set up the scenario in the same sort of lyricy prose of the rambling introductory monologue.After that, while still attempting to retain its existential aura, it plays like a typical haunted house movie, only with a small handful of jump scares.As an aside that irritated me far more than it likely should, the introductory paragraph of the in-universe novel ""The Lady in the Walls"" introducing Polly Parsons led me to believe that Polly had died only moments after being born, and yet throughout the rest of the movie she is described and depicted as having grown into adulthood and apparently been murdered by someone.From there, we are treated to seemingly loosely connected scenes just happening one after the other, culminating in a long, drawn out final sequence in which the main character directly spots the ghost of Polly... and apparently dies of fright, or of a heart attack. The ghost does nothing but walks around and stares at her.After that we get a drawn out epilogue that ties in to the opening monologue regarding people moving in to houses where people died in them, and the implication that the main character may be a ghost there now."
" A tale of terror
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,10,"This is an unbelievably brilliant film. This is the moment film and terror meet, not gory action flick horror, but impressionistic terror, slowly built up like a piece of carefully arranged music until it leads you to an inevitable and already foreshadowed tragedy. I've said this review contains spoilers but the main protagonist is clear about her story from the opening scene. The music, sometimes played on an old tape player, sometimes part of the atmosphere, or sometimes faintly haunting refrains from long ago (diegetic and extradiegetic, the music fades and mixes like the hallucinatory visuals). The main character has what is the worst job in the universe. And what do you know, she doesn't even get to watch TV, let alone use up her data trying to watch YouTube videos. Kudos to Oz Perkins and Elvis Perkins for scaring the hell out of me. Such a beautiful film. For those who have trouble relating, just spend a weekend in an old house in the countryside and listen for the ghosts. You can shine your phone into the dark maw of the doorway if you like. Who knows what shadows you'll see."
" It is all about how you present the story
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,9,"It is not about the story, it is about how the story was being presented.Unlike other horror movies that are filled with scream, blood, actions - which we have been tiring of, this movie is slow, elegant, carefully narrates the story but gives a difference kind of intensity. With the profound background music and the tactfully filming angles that helped build a depressing atmosphere, the dark scenes could easily stretch to your deep heart. And this is the art of filming.I love the way the director presents the story. It perfectly proves that it is not only about the plots, it is more about the way of showing it. Love its slow, quiet, and Gothic style. It is another level of horror movie."
" Second Time Watcher
",2017-11-09 00:00:00,2,"Possible Spoilers: But, my second time watching this and I still don't get it. I grew up in the horror story/horror flick culture starting with Tales from the DarkSide and The Twilight Zone to fall asleep to with my dear deceased grandmother (god rest her soul). I still don't get this movie. Every time watching, thus far, the only thing that goes through my mind is, ""what the actual ////?"" I am leaning towards isolation. However, could be beautifully written with greater meaning as I am thinking on it now. I would love to see an explanation or some cliffs notes on this movie for sure. The haunting vision of Polly walking behind Lily and the last words that Mrs. Blum speaks to Lily will for sure haunt my thoughts for a while."
" Gothic art-house falls flat
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,4,"""We make our own ghosts by looking, but pretending not to see... and then forgetting ourselves altogether. It is a terrible thing to look at oneself and all the while see nothing. Surely this is how we make our own ghosts. We make them out of ourselves.""For me, that quote basically sums up this disappointing and annoying movie: mildly pretentious, redundant, and not especially clever. It's a real shame, because the elements are all here for an enjoyably psychological slow-burn Gothic ghost story. There's a period house with beautiful but creaky wooden floors, very good performances from Paula Prentiss as decaying schlock author Iris Blum and Ruth Wilson as Lily Saylor, Iris' in-home hospice nurse, and a leisurely atmosphere of creepy indulgence as real life and the horror from one of Iris' books blend together for an increasingly disturbed Lily. This movie's slow pace and artistic presentation have turned off a lot of people, and it's tempting to sneer and say poor reviews are a result of viewers being too conditioned to glossy CGI, predictable gore, loud noises and jump scares, but I don't feel that's fair. ""I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House"" looks great. The lighting and design is very theatrical, and the abundant narration is poetic, but it is also ultimately very repetitive (literally) and self-indulgent, lacking either a compelling message or strong development. There's a lot of focus on introspection, identity, and creep factor - and the score is not above the kind of dissonant jump scare cues you'd find in movies with less lofty ambitions - and the premise never hangs together or deepens into what it promises. A flabby script and the central logical problem of a main character who is patently very ill-suited for her job - being way too easily spooked to stay alone in a strange house, not to mention unusually timid, squeamish, and apparently unused to dealing with dementia for a hospice nurse - combine to cripple the movie's impact, and what should be an involving Gothic story simply becomes an agonisingly slow and laboured non-story with no pay-off. The two leads, whose performances are among the only good points on offer, deserved much better."
" I Am the Boring Movie That Makes you fall Asleep
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,1,"Awful....I'm not one to judge a book by it's cover so to say, but I felt the cover of this one drew me in, it felt ominous & intriguing. The main character, Lily, as played by Ruth Wilson is staying in the home of an old author who is in her last days, which spans out a lot longer.There were eerie moments that weren't just cheap jump scares, Ruth Wilson was wonderful in this role but the movie itself....When did it begin? It was one of those films that felt like it was still leading you into the meaty part of it... but it never came. Credit to it, I kept saying ""in the next 5 minutes something will happen""... Nope... ""Ok, maybe now?"".... still nothing. So, it had the ability to drag you in deeper & deeper with the belief - the hope! - that something else, anything else, would happen!I'm no expert in films, but i'm surprised this has so many high reviews on here... maybe too many people are being polite.."
" Very slow and very boring
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,1,"Don't waste your time. The best thing about this movie is the narration. It's full of similes. It would be a good way to teach an English class about similes. It's a good example of a Gothic film and had a plot, but it just did not hold my interest. Also, parts of the story contradicted itself. I would not recommend this film. I was disappointed."
" Don't waste your time.
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,2,"This movie is an incredibly boring hour and a half of nothing. There is barely a plot and what there is goes unexplained. The most exciting thing to happen in the entire movie was a phone getting ripped out of the lead's hand, and it wasn't that exciting. I'm pretty sure the movie was some convoluted way of explaining the dangers of house mold. Don't waste your time."
" Visually Beautiful
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,7,"This is a serene and stylishly shot ghost story. It brings to mind vintage tales of haunted houses but has an extra layer of depth in its story-within-a-story, something like what MR James might have written. Its one fault is that it's a little too long, but it has strong visual presence and a good central performance that both keep it interesting."
" I am the boring thing that wastes your time
",2017-10-13 00:00:00,1,"Dull story that takes place in one set with a very small cast. Not much of a horror but just dreary, depressing, so dull I barely remember what it was all about even though I watched it 5 mins ago. There's a female narrative throughout that sounds like an emo dalek and often repeating the same lines. Giving away the cliffhanger at the start just took away any kind of suspense that might've been present in the story."
" Disappointing to a Gothic ghost story fan
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,1,"I love ghost stories, especially Gothic style. Slow pacing does not bore me. This movie,however, pushed me to the point of actual anger with how nonsensical it was. It is not a ghost story; there is actually no story at all. It's merely a set of slow paced scenes with a meaningless narration that'll irritate the hell out of you by the third time you hear it. It's poor writing masquerading as art house. It needs a zero rating."
" Who haunts whom?
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,8,"I loved how this film was all about setting and succeeded in creating a tense and interesting atmosphere, while only using one house and only a handful of actors with very few lines of text. The lack of dialogue made me pay close attention to everything that was said, to try and find meaning behind every single word. I loved that some dialogue was less important while other was more important.Another thing I appreciated was the pace of the film. The long scenes made me look for things I might miss, to look for the part which is supposed to be scary. Often there was nothing there. This caused a very tense atmosphere during the whole film.Finally some words about the story. The events that happened in the film could be shown in 20 minutes, but it would ruin the setting and meaning of it all. The story is short, but I thought it connected well. It makes the viewer wonder about the events that happened during the film and what caused it. -Who haunts whom?"
" 2 hours of my life I'll never get back
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,1,"Oh dear God, just get ON with it already! This was like watching paint dry. I appreciated the fact that no monsters jumped out of closets or books didn't fly off shelves, it was definitely more the psychological movie, but I can't in good conscience call it a thriller, because it was so boring. Don't waste your time with this one. Go out and try to feel the earth move, it'll be more productive."
" Gorgeous But Incomplete
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,6,"This is a visually pleasing film. It's even sort of aurally pleasing. It wouldn't have been detrimental to the plot at all to have Ruth Wilson use her natural accent, but the stilted American accent added to the ambiance of the piece. The plot, on the other hand, as slow moving as it is, is missing a lot. That makes for a sleepy sort of movie that can lull you into a dreamy state, but the payoff just doesn't, well, pay off. It's pretty enough to watch once, but don't expect too much."
" The most accurate review.
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,1,"If you did not pay the Wi-Fi bill this month and still want to watch this movie it's OK. go to Wal-Mart, buy some paint, slap it on the wall, and watch it dry for 1.5 hours.The best part about watching this movie was it ending, then going on Google to Google reviews to see if everyone else had the same confusion and experienced the same boredom I had, only to find the honest reviews stating how horrible the movie was. They had me dying laughing. it almost made watching it worth it. thank you for the reviews. I don't feel like that 90 minutes was a total loss now."
" Boring. How Did This Even Get Made?
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,2,"Mind-numbingly boring. I don't understand how something like this gets funding to be made. The acting was decent. The voice was creepy. The music was creepy. But there was no story. I'm surprised I made it to the end. I should've turned it off much earlier. I Googled ""best horror movies on Netflix"" and this popped up as a top 20. It certainly was not horror. Not scary nor thrilling. If it was a 20-minute Twilight Zone episode, it still would have been too long. It will be forgotten the day after you watch it. Skip it and save the time."
" silly not scary.
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,1,They tried to be scary but it was funny. It was slow. They keep building up the tension- but nothing happens. So why do it? It was a complete waste of time. Don't watch! They tried to make a link with the old lady and the ghost. But again nothing really happened! The person who wrote this didn't think about the story or probably just wanted a paycheck or maybe it got lost in the editing who knows.
" Too unexplained to be this slow
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,4,"The movie is beautifully filmed, and some of the monologues are very poetic and atmospheric, however, the movie does not live up to expectation. The main character proves to be very irritating and (occasionally) psychologically stunted, unable to read mild horror stories and awkward in her interactions with other people (to the point of being scared to open the door, etc). She does everything extremely slowly, and doesn't get deeper into solving a mystery even if she is given every opportunity to do so.This lack of courage to act on curiosity leads to a plot where the viewer never finds anything out. What did the ghost whisper to the old woman? What was written in the letters in the moldy box? Did they belong to the ghost in the house? Did the ghost kill the caretaker on purpose, and if so, why? And, most importantly: why did the ghost's husband kill her in the first place? The film ends up being very slow paced and unfocused, fading away into vagueness instead of providing a coherent conclusion. This could have been an amazing horror film, but it didn't even come close to achieving its potential."
" Slow build to ..... Nothing
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,3,"Many reviewers have called this film ""a beautiful poem"", ""a beautiful period piece"", and a throwback to pure Gothic. It did have atmosphere, but I found it more soporific than nostalgic. Wish I had watched it after dark, as it's alleged that the true artistry is seen only without distraction. As it was, I watched it while my husband slept in the chair, both cats jumped on the couch to sleep and my dog wandered off into the other room. After the first half hour of watching, I got up to make coffee, and that action was a frenzied explosion of activity compared to the movie. I assume Polly, apparently a psychic since her clothing was that of a woman dressed sixty years into the future, was murdered by her new husband, walled up behind the wainscoting, and slowly molded away. I can't believe Lily ever earned a nursing degree, as her character was as slow-witted as she was slow moving. The beautiful Paula Prentiss, whose bone structure has at least endured, has little to do but stare vacantly at the wall. Her character is relatively mobile and apparently without stress of any type, but she isn't cared for, as you see only two interactions between her and her caregiver. Did no one ever feed her? Wash her hair? Change the sheets? Nothing ever ""happened"" in this movie, but if it had, it would have occurred in a vacuum. The pace is akin to watching coal turn into diamonds, and no consensus is reached about what happened in this house or to these people. Slasher movies are not my thing, but I do expect something to HAPPEN, and a reasonable resolution."
" A Beautifully Crafted Horror Film
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,10,"While I rarely post reviews of films or post comments online, I felt compelled to try and reverse the trend of trashing this film by so many philistines. (And I won't waste precious space with my dissertation about America's sad cultural decline and the elevation of low-brow mediocrity to the high standard it enjoys today.) Briefly, the film is a minimalist offering by Osgood Perkins. It concerns the interactions between a very anxious, young hospice nurse, assigned to take care of an ailing author of horror stories, and a cold, emotionless lawyer in charge of the author's estate; all taking place in an isolated house built in the early 19th century. Using dramatic chiaroscuro, pale colors, a paucity of household furnishings, subtle noises and an off-tone, muted and bare musical score, the filmmaker carefully creates an atmosphere which quickly plays on the viewer's mind (if you are open to such things). The superb acting and narration only add to this frightful poem and while the story may feel somewhat disjointed to some, I found myself dwelling on this provocative movie for quite some time. I feel grateful that there are still filmmakers, like Osgood Perkins and Robert Eggers (who made ""The Witch""), who possess incredible imaginations and truly understand the craft of making very powerful and emotive films for those who want more out of experiencing a film than the usual bombastic, no-need-to- think, carnival ride that is so prevalent today.If one has ever been alone, overnight, in an old dark house, as the surroundings begin to close in on you and and the thought that you are not alone takes hold, then, I believe, you'll be receptive to this wonderful film."
" You are the worst thing that lives in Netflix
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,1,"Never seen worse horror movie in my whole life.There is no clear story line ,no attractive characters,even the atmosphere is bad.Is it a challenge that Netflix wanted to make a movie with about 10 bugs budget,shoot and wrap in 8 days,and about 5 actors?In a 90 minutes movie? Stop insulting the audiences OK?"
" ""I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House""- Both the most engaging and enthralling horror film I've seen in some time... and also one of the most tedious.
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,6,"On its surface, it would be very easy to outright dismiss writer/director Osgood Perkins' atmospheric Gothic-horror picture ""I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House."" And for good reason. The film is an exercise in deliberation. But it is an exercise that goes too far too often, and suffers for it. Without doubt, most viewers who choose to indulge in viewing it will find their minds wandering and themselves nodding off within the first act because the film's pacing and structure lend to an overpowering sense of tedium and dullness. This is without doubt the very definition of a ""slow burn."" It both literally and figuratively crawls from scene to scene, with dialog delivered in drawn out whispers and characters moving as if filmed in slow motion at all times. Even as someone with a great bit of patience for films such as this, I found myself checking my phone more times than I'd like to admit.And yet... I never felt the urge to stop watching. Because despite this glaring issue, the craftsmanship and storytelling is completely enthralling and endlessly engaging, with a grand old-fashioned vibe that I couldn't help but be pulled into from the very first scene. In many ways, it reminded me of the campfire ghost stories of old, classic Hollywood creep-fests of the 50's and 60's and the ancient photographs of ghosts and spirits you stumble across when you research the supernatural. So much of the film is so lovingly assembled to tell a classic tale of the unknown that I couldn't help but watch it start-to-finish... even when it very nearly put me to sleep more than once.The film follows the tale of a lonely and easily frightened young woman called Lily (Ruth Wilson), who is hired to serve as a live-in caregiver to retired author Iris Blum (Paula Prentiss) in her final years. But as the film informs us through a wonderfully poetic opening narration, Lily's future is a dark one- she tells us that within the year, she will be dead, and we will be witness to the events that lead up to her passing. And the film follows just what happened, as Lily is haunted by strange sounds and visions and begins to suspect that there is something very wrong in the home of Iris Blum. Something that may be connected to her most popular novella- a tale of horror called ""The Lady in the Walls.""The strengths of the film lay in Perkins capable hands as a storyteller. The film is absolutely stunning to behold, with an intriguing premise that keeps you thoroughly invested and some of the most gorgeous cinematography in some time, despite the film taking place almost entirely inside of a single house. The expert sense of composition and movement that Perkins excels at builds and maintains a startling and sometimes overwhelming sense of dread and pure guttural terror, and his keen use of carefully calculated jumps will illicit some serious creeps for open minded horror fans. He also wisely keeps the film both focused but also vague, giving it a bit of a mystery flair that will keep you wondering what will come next. And of course, as mentioned before, the dialog and structure of the film is pure poetry. Very classy work.But it comes at a cost. That being the frankly bizarre sense of pacing that is a result of the calm, calculated storytelling. I hate to say it, but this is a phenomenal short film that is nearly destroyed because it is slowly (and arguably needlessly) dragged to feature length to the point of hilarity and then frustration. There's no good reason this same film could not have been told in a much shorter span of time. A forty minute short-subject with this exact same script and these exact same shots would have been a revelation of pure terror. But padding it out to near ninety minutes is nearly a kiss of death to the entire project. There's only so long you can see Wilson slowly wandering down the hallways moving at a pace of only one step every ten seconds before you feel a yawn arising... only so many times the camera can linger eerily on the same open doorway while slowly zooming in for effect before it starts to feel empty... only so many times you can hear the same droning creaks of floorboards for minutes on end before it loses effect. The pacing is nearly a disaster.As it stands, it's almost impossible to recommend ""I Am the Pretty thing That Lives in the House"" to any potential audience. It's beautiful. Stunning even. And a wonderful ghost story told in an unconventional fashion. But it comes at the cost of pacing. I can see too many people being too bored of it to suggest it to anyone outside of the most forgiving of genre fans. But if you prefer and enjoy deliberate horror. If you relish in the slow-burn of features like ""The Witch"" and ""The Shining."" You might get something out of it. I give it an above average 6 out of 10. A beautiful but troubled work of art."
" The only thrills here were how slow paced and lacking events this movie was...
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,1,"When I found this movie, I was lured in by the movie's cover/poster and also the somewhat alluring synopsis. So I was preparing myself to sit down for a creepy thriller movie. However, that was not to be.I wanted so much to give this movie every possible chance, especially since the story had so much potential to be great. But it just never happened.I managed to sit through 55 minutes of mind numbing and excruciating boredom. Nothing happened, and I do literally mean nothing. Well, something did happen, as someone was pulling on the phone cord while the nurse was talking on the phone, yanking the phone out of her hand. And that was the only thing that was anywhere near interesting in all of those 55 minutes.The story really had every chance to be a good and fulfilling horror movie, but it just failed to do so in transition from script to actual on-screen performance. The storyline was so incredibly slow paced that it was a struggle to keep focusing on the movie. But not only was the storyline slow paced, it was also incredibly uneventful (as I mentioned earlier).As far as the acting went, well the performers seemed to be droning about in a blank stupor, performingly equally slow to match the slow pace of the storyline. I am sure that they were doing good enough jobs and doing what they were directed to do. But the lack of motivation from a proper script was permeating their performances. But wow, the slow paced performances were almost enough to lull me to sleep.Let me just state once again that nothing, absolutely nothing happens in this movie - or at least the 55 minutes I managed to suffer through.All in all, ""I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House"" is without a doubt the most boring and uneventful of thrillers to have seen the light of day in 2016. But more impressively, then it is actually in the top three of all time boring movies that I have had the unfortunate pleasure of getting acquainted with. There is no chance of me ever returning to watch the rest of the movie. The 55 minutes that I endured was enough to last a life time and then some."
" The only scary thing about this movie is how BORING it is.
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,1,"This movie was the absolute biggest waste of time that I have ever suffered through. Every movement and scene was agonizingly drawn out and there was nothing really redeemable about it. I was bored out of my mind and wanted to throttle the main character for being so SLLLLOOOWWW throughout this entire movie. What a lame snooze-fest. For the love of God, do not waste your precious life away on this crap."
" Terrible
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,1,"If you're watching this, then do yourself a favor and skip to the hour mark. You won't miss anything. The acting is dreadful, and the cinematography is drab. This movie is full of boring scenes punctuated by or futilely embellished by music in an attempt to create tension. The main character is frustratingly naive and innocent; how are you going to live in a house for 11 months without TV and not read a single book on the shelf or go through any drawers? Each section of the film is prefaced by a stinted monologue which could be legitimately creepy if it matched or enhanced the events on screen but instead falls completely flat. Aside from an isolated body integrity moment, it's not scary or creepy at all. Certainly not an ode to loneliness as some claim. If you must know the story, watch the last 30 minutes, otherwise watch the first shot (with the ghost just barely out of focus) as that's the only worthwhile moment in the film. I think this would work better in book form. But even then it could use better characters."
" Not worth watching
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,1,"When an atmospheric horror film with little dialogue is done well, it can be a very powerful film that is more frightening than a lot of dialogue-driven films. Look at horror classics like The Testament of Dr. Mabuse or Nosferatu for examples. There was not a lot going on in this movie and it felt like it was building up to something terrifying or unimaginable, but the end of the movie was a huge let down for me. Maybe I just don't understand art house horror movies or maybe there was something I missed in the movie, but I just didn't like it very much. It can be best described as having a lot of spooky music and noises and a lot of build up, but not a lot of plot or scariness."
" Reviews, who needs them?
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,5,"This movie is a perfect example of why viewer's reviews are completely and utterly superfluous. The word of the day my completely misguided misanthropes is ""SUBJECTIVITY"". Obviously people do not and have not attempted upon expanding and utilizing the neural network you physiologically have been gifted since birth. The vast majority could easily create the same reviews applying the same brain power they have in their posteriors. Use some critical thinking skills here and take your ""reality"" out of the equation.1. Those that gave this movie the near or perfect maximum rating. Do you REALLY believe this movie is the penultimate that man has written or filmed? You must, you believe it perfect and it stand against the greatest of films ever created. That is UTTER nonsense. It is an average film at best in our realm of reasoning. You obviously have VERY little experience with films. Please mull upon this point for a moment.2. It is NOT a one star movie. Again, the persons thinking that have absolutely NO idea what a bad movie is and obviously NEVER watches movies so their experience in the overall reality we all share is so limited their opinion is irrelevant. I could give you the names of 100s of movies that you could not bear to view. Again, no experience.3. Take yourself out of the loop when attempting to do a review, you can't! Whatever you are ""FEELING"" or ""OPINION"" (utterly valueless) is what we are given as a review. Pointless and meaningless. 4. If we appropriate the stream of thinking 99.9% of people present upon IMDb we come up with a completely acceptable but wholly untrue statement. ""Casablanca was one of the worst films ever made because I loathe Humphrey Bogart and feel he had no acting ability"". Again ""You"" were the main focal point of said statement, not the movie or actor. This is what these ridiculous reviews boil down to. Utter worthlessness. I think, I feel, who cares?5. Do we REALLY need 7,000 reviews focusing on a movie? No, all imbeciles do is continually write the EXACT same point (positive or negative) ad nausea. Unless a movie has very FEW reviews or you have something to bring to the review that is of REAL interest, why write?So what we do experience is an entity ""Netflix"", which is basing its financial existence upon creating a body of original work to sell as a service. They have had a few successes and the majority is ""average"". They touch base upon all genres to attempt to get saturation and viewer-ship. This is foray in the ""Gothic"" horror realm. Very little is produced in this sub-genre per year. It is competently shot. It has adequate acting. It is slow paced so if you expect ""Aliens"" you are not going to like it. The score it has derived at 4.7 is aptly given, an average movie. People, start using the three pounds of convoluted tissue that resides in your cranium for once. Perhaps you will begin to experience the ""Shared"" reality we hominids experience and not just ""YOUR"" reality."
" Slightly macabre.. Artistically palatable for acquired taste
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,9,"Don't be put off by the rating of this film. When all the dust settles over Oz Perkins' direction, I suspect many critics will backtrack over their first impressions given time. I've seen a few comments regarding ""what genre"".. thereby lies the confusion..If you are expecting Slasher, Action, Blood and Gore, easy access plot, you will be disappointed. On the other hand, if you expect deeply artistic, thought provoking for a more mature attention span, you will be pleasantly surprised.!If this film was a meal and you were eating out, it would be fine dining as opposed to ""all you can eat"".. It's never ""on the boil"", just, gently simmering, leaving you pleasantly satisfied and not bursting at the seams requiring an antacid to relieve the indigestion and heartburn."
" Super slow and boring
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,1,"I can dig a movie that's slow and atmospheric and takes it's time revealing the story, but this movie just winds on and on with no real plot or purpose and a disappointing ending. It took me 2 tries to finish it because it kept making me fall asleep. It just couldn't really hold my attention. I could mess around on my phone for a few minutes and still not miss anything going on in the movie. It tries and fails to be something it isn't and that's a well-done story. Skip it or put it on if you need a cure for sleeplessness. It works like a charm for that."
" Not for me at all.
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,3,"This is so not what I expected. In a very bad, painfully slow way. I see a few people are talking about how poetic this movie was. And also saying something about Gothic literature style that I know nothing about. But I can understand where they are coming from and why some people might enjoy it. However...if you are like me and you love some 70/80's horror movies, some gore here and there or less abstract psychological terror, pretty little thing is probably not the movie for you too. I almost fell asleep a few times watching it, it's slow, has almost no sense of progress and it's pretty much a monologue. The scenes and editing were weird, they felt odd and sooooo long. The movie has an hour and a half, but seemed so much longer. Well... I would not recommend."
" People Hate a Slow Burn
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,6,"A young nurse takes care of elderly author who lives in a haunted house.This film seems to be getting negative responses from people, at least if I take IMDb as any sort of serious guide. At this time (January 2017) it sits at 4.8, which isn't awful but is certainly far from great. Having now seen the film, I find the low rating surprising. The acting is great, and there is nothing wrong with the film as far as technical matters go.My guess is that people have the wrong mindset. The film was promoted by Rue Morgue, among others, and maybe people got caught up in some hype of Oz Perkins or misunderstood. Much like the recent Guillermo del Toro ghost story, people need to see this type of horror (the ""gothic romance"") as different from what they expect. It might be slower and there will be less blood. But it is about creating a mood, which I think this film does rather well."
" Boring ""Horror"" Movie
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,1,"This was one of the most boring horror movies I have ever watched! I spent the whole movie waiting for something, anything to happen, and nothing ever did. First of all, it was quite an ambitious hope that one person with little interaction with anyone else could pull off a full length 90-minute movie all on their own, with only a few voice over narrations to move the story along. Indeed, what story? There was almost no story here, except the back story of ""Polly"", who is supposed to be the ghost haunting the house. In reality, Polly is nothing more than a made-up character that the owner of the house, and dementia patient that almost never speaks, invented years prior, and in her dementia, has come to believe actually existed and told her the story she wrote about said character. Makes no sense. As far as I could tell from the movie itself, there was no ghost in the house; only the main character's scaredy cat adolescent behavior, jumping at shadows in a big creepy, isolated house.The main character herself spends half the movie mumbling to herself, and doing everyday tasks that the director seemed to feel needed to be dragged out far too long in a misguided attempt to build suspense or atmosphere or something, but never quite getting there. It just made the scenes feel too long, and the movie feel twice as long as it actually was. A giant snooze fest.The main character was painful to watch. She was scared of the house she now finds herself in. She's scared of her shadow. She's scared of the old house creaking in the background. She's scared of her reflection in the mirror. There's a scene or two where she attempts to read the book the owner of the house wrote about the character of ""Polly"" and she literally jumps at nothing. She's too scared to read some words on a piece of paper. The actresses' attempts to pull this movie off with the anxiety riddled twit she portrayed are painful to endure for the entire length of the movie. It was painful to watch. Indeed, the movie as a whole was cringe worthy, and not in a good way as far as horror movies go.The end literally made no sense. None, whatsoever. The scardy cat twit comes walking down the stairs, because she thinks she hears something, sees the wall panels pulled open, and as she's walking through the house, she doesn't turn on one single light. If you thought you heard someone or something inside your house in the middle of the night (for all intents and purposes, you could call it her house too, she is actually living there as the nurse), wouldn't you be turning on lights and searching the house, instead of just wandering though the dark rooms? Wouldn't that make more sense? No, she just wanders aimlessly through the house in the dark, turns a corner, thinks she sees a ghost and drops dead of fright. WTF? In the very next scene, the wall panels are back on the wall, and her ""ghost"" sees her own body dead in front of the door. So, she literally scared herself to death over nothing? Really? I honestly don't get why this film rated so high with film critics, but then again, only a film critic could actually like this movie that goes nowhere and tells no tales. This entire movie played like a college film project, rather than a serious attempt at making well thought out, thought provoking, or engaging horror movie of any sort. I won't expect much from future Oz Perkins films, if I even bother watching another one.For those of you that haven't seen this yet, don't waste your time. I created this account just to write this and try to spare you this 90-minute snooze fest. There are much better atmospheric horror films out there. Give this one a pass."
" To each their own I suppose
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,5,"For a small film this has certainly attracted a very polarized array of opinions. It has to do with the gap between people who like movies to be entertaining and people who go to film school and attend The Cinema to talk to other people of the same background and education about The Cinema.At its base this is a Gothic tale best suited to a short form film. 30, 40 minutes tops to work out the story. At 87 minutes it's just indulging the writer director to give unedited flight to his ideas. What is touted as 'discomforting' is irritation. Scenes and cuts that could be better done close tight and short are allowed to meander on and on as if Perkins wants the audience reaction TO the movie to be a component IN the movie. There are people who will love the utter lack of story, coherence, narrative, dialog, fear or suspense just as there will be people who hate it because it makes 'Upstream Color' feel like it's racing along at the pace of a Bourne movie. It's THAT slow. In fact it's so slow it subtly shifts what the definition of a movie IS almost to the point of an experimental movie of say, literally watching paint dry for 24 hrs.But it is visually arresting albeit in a way that print advertising is visually arresting. The 'story' isn't a story it's a series of flashes you are asked to draw your own conclusions about."
