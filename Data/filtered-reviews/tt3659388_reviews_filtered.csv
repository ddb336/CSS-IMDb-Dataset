" Scarcely did I expext such a gripping plot!
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,"Before watching the film I had flicked through comments here. Nonetheless, I did't think that The Martian would be so intriguing and action-packed. Usually movies about outer space have a threadbare plot. They are fillfuled with implausble creatures. Moreover, so many subordinate plots do such films maintain, that it becomes quiet hard to concentrate and follow the general link. By contrast, not only does The Martian hold the viewer's attention to the bitter end, but also it provides the sence that similar events could be real! Its labyrinthine plot is connected with life of man who is forced to survive in extreme conditions, namely on Mars. Is he able to do it? Or it is going to be such a creepy end? You can learn it right now! In addition, I wanna say that no sooner had the film finished, than I started to cry!"
" Expected something darker
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,7,"It's a good piece of alone-in-space-drama, but I didn't expect those funny sequences here and there, that I suppose were meant to entertain. Some comic relief is all fine, but it felt ridiculous sometimes. I would have preferred it to be darker and more serious. I saw Gravity the night before and it had a much deeper impact on me. It had its moments of comic relief for sure, but they worked much better. And also the claustrophobic/agoraphobic element was so much more present in Gravity. And about the science - I have to say they could have tweaked the sound design for more realism. Sound is different on Mars. Higher frequencies attenuate quickly due to Mars' atmospere. I'm no physicist, but I know how to google. So in the outdoor scenes sound would be very muffled, lacking the higher frequencies we're used to hearing on Earth. Maybe they concidered this but it didn't work...? No, IMHO they should have gone for more realism. It would have served the movie well."
" Great
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,10,I like how he showed feeling for the rover before he took off in Ares 4.
" Best space travel flick
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,10,"Acting, special effects, science accuracy...The all round space travel flick, if you will..."
" After INTERSTELLAR, my favorite!
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a job well-done. Incredible execution. Matt Damon's performance alone make this movie a masterpiece in Sci-fi genre. Personally, i adore Sci-fi movies. It's my favorite genre. And i have seen many of 'em but nothing hit me like Interstellar and The Martian did. This is an incredible movie. A must watch one. I recommend 100%."
" very funny
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,8,"I tried reading this book and gave up like 5 pages in because it was so boring. The movie sounds even more boring- Matt Damon stuck on Mars alone for several months- but it's genuinely hilarious. The pacing is impressive considering the limited characters and settings. The science side of things is not overwhelmingly difficult, but it's also not dumbed down in an unrealistic way. You can really feel the tension when Mark Watney is communicating with people on Earth, and you can feel the frustration and isolation when he is struggling through survival tasks alone."
" One of 2015 best films if not the best
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,9,One of the best films of 2015 if not the best film of that year. The acting is top not from every single actor in surprised they didn't win the sag award for film. The story is also great it's edge of your seat and then at times very funny. The special effects are also top notch. Amazing film to watch and highly recommend for everyone to see.
" Pretty Good
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,7,"Obviously, this is one of those movies where it is predictable from start to finish. Man gets lost, has to be found, has to to survive alone, etc etc. So obviosly there will be some cliche endings. There is some things things to poke fun at and flaws that are kind of ridicuolous. I don't know if all of the science is 100% accurate because it is based on a fictional book.
It's kind of funny it has two actors from interstellar in it that are main characters in interstellar and are main characters in this movie. But they did a good job acting anyways.
This is not a perfect movie, but I still think it was fun to watch with the family. I don't know if it would be as fun to watch by myself than instead of watching it with the family, so I would recommend watching it with the family."
" A pure cerebral feast
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,10,"It was great to see a scientific sci-fi where everything made sense and wasn't moulding into fantasy. No little green men. No oversized bugs. A pure cerebral feast. The whole blend was superb - acting, scenery, dialogues. I had a problem only with overly, but predictably, twisted plot, where every single thing goes wrong in order to introduce a new thing (which will go wrong). This multitude of suspenses levels out your attention after a while. However, if this film is not ten stars, I don't know what is."
" movie for nerds
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,9,"This is my favorite movie to watch when I need peaceful movie night. At first I didn't have high hope for this movie because it's a movie about astronaut and mar. Usually these combination will lead to boring nerds' movie, after I watch it I would say that it is a nerd's movie but it's not a boring movie. The story have been tell by good pacing there are times that protagonist is sparks with hope and crushed with unfortunate situations. There are some political problem in cooperate that shown in this movie too. The sound is also well design. My favorite scene is potato farming scene because it's first scene that show hope for protagonist to survive. I also like the cast of Mark Watney(Matt demon) because of his performance as only human that exist at mar at that moment. But I also have some dislike as the scene of potato farm are ruin because it look like it's too intended as story driver. The best component I think this movie have is how they tell science information without making it boring with details, Ridley scott has done excellent work with this movie as example of sci-fi that doesn't have to be boring."
" Overall, Awesome film!
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,9,"This is a very well directed film with a great story. Matt Damon was great in this film and The visuals(just like in many other space movie)
Was phenomenal. The only flaw I would say with this movie is that some of the side characters could have been given more things to do in the story."
" 2021-3-1
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,8,"The China part was kinda odd. Maybe they couldn't make it more reasonable in the movie. So if you eat potatoes only, you're gonna die in 2 years, but, of course, if you're positive as Mark Watney and had choices, you wouldn't treat your body that way. Would? Mentioned about positiveness and humour, what about a person who was positive and humorous but suck at relationship?"
" Very Cinematic
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,9,"Plot: not that bad, is very romanticise, maybe too much. But still is very enjoyable.Actors and Actress & Acting: well, Matt Demond did an extremely good job, really. Also the others were very good.Visual Effects: extremely well done, very cinematic.Soundtrack: very very good! There is no miss.Conclusions: a good movie that, maybe, with a little more drama would have been more apprised."
" The Martian
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,10,Its an amazing movie and I would be going to mars on 2033.
" Good thanks 😊
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,8,The movie is better then i though..i just love it..
" Astronaut stranded on Mars has hope of returning home. Great visuals, scientifically accurate for the most part.
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Compelling plot that keeps you interested in the character as he succeeds and is then set back. Held back just a bit by stupid early-2000s-2010s type jokes. I did not like the ending; it was one of those disappointing endings where the character shows up much later as a teacher in an epilogue. Otherwise a compelling suspense movie, well done."
" Simply put,
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,9,"The best Ridley Scott film ever made.The only Scott film in which he does not put any unnecessary weight on his direction of making the tone, mood, action, etc."
" Mediocre space sci-fi film
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,6,"1. Matt Damon delivered concrete acting, but the character is very one-dimensional; no family, no friends, whatsoever; very very limited character development throughout the entire film2. Numerous plots that does not make any sense; Matt Damon flying in the space like Ironman really kills all the realism in the film3. Not the first time I see Chinese government added in the plot as a ""saviour"" (here i'm referring to the film Arrival). Out of nowhere the Chinese authority would offer help to NASA and save the poor astronaut with their unknown great technology. This is an obvious strategy to facilitate promotion of the film in the great Chinese market irl, but is also such a disgrace to the entire plot, ignoring all the complex real life politics... 0% similar to reality...4. Still I'll give the film a 7/10 for the good CG and acting from Damon. I have seen far worse movies."
" I just watched Perseverance land on Mars!!!!!!!!!!! BRAVO!.
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,10,"I watched brilliance on the screen, accomplished by thousands of people who contributed to the making of the film The Martian. No matter how much a spoiled brat you may be, who never contributed a nickel's worth of anything to any other person or cause, thank goodness NASA is not like you.. I did not read the book which the film is based on, but do not see how it could be made any better. I thought it was just brilliant. I have been in my apartment since last April and this was a welcome trip out of this world! I wish everybody in the credits was named. I will not be alive when any people arrive on Mars. I wish you Godspeed and onwards and upwards. Take really good coffee with you and goodies!"
" Probably the worst performance of Damon
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,6,"Movie starts off well. Pretty good visuals, good actors, CGI mars terrain reproduced beautifully. First 30-40 minutes is really promising honestly. Then it becomes a borefest.I think the main reason why it's so boring is the terrible performance of Matt Damon rather than inferior script or lack of tension. Entire movie he made me feel zero sympathy for protagonist. He's dull as possible. No fear, no madness, no connections to relatives. You see that he rations his food and he must be looking like a skeleton after a while. Yes, his ""body double"" is a skinny guy but Damon's face looks more healtier than any regular person. he's always in spacesuit and only thing we can see is his face. Clearly this role requires losing considerable amount of weight and if you are not willing to Christian Baled for this role then don't take the part. On top of that zero character development makes things much worse.It was difficult to finish the movie after 70-80 minutes mark. Especially ending was like a joke. CNN broadcasts the entire operation along with conversation goes with astronauts with zero delay as if it's happening instantenously like a Whatsapp call was laughable.I can't even believe its score is still 8/10, which is even higher than some great space movies like Apollo 13, Alien, Moon etc."
" Boring and childish
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,4,"The entire film is made as the work of a high school student who has no idea about the basics of physics.
On top of that it is infinitely boring and unconvincing.
It is full of meaningless scenes, and the funniest thing is when we discover that the spaceship is full of fresh potatoes !!!"
" The reason I didn't give it a 10...........
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,9,"So with this film I really enjoyed the scientific side to it and how possible it could be to one day live on Mars. It had the usual space danger moments, but the reason didn't give it a 10 was some parts just felt too unrealistic and I started to question it at times."
" A sci-fi not only for sci-fi fans
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,9,"The Martian is one of my most favourite films. It is a Ridley Scott's action sci-fi film which is based on the book by writer Andy Weir. Matt Damon stars as an astronaut Mark Watney - ""the Martian"".
The plot starts at the end of the research mission on Mars. NASA astronaut, a botanist and mechanical engineer Mark Watney went missing in a dust storm during a mission on Mars. The rest of his crew left the planet, thinking he is dead. But Watney survived and he must find the way how to survive alone on the foreign planet and how to send signal to the Earth to say that he's alive.
Although the film is quite slow-paced and there are not many action scenes, it is still immersive. That's because the place of the film set as well as the special effects are outstanding and make the film realistic and credible. The soundtrack is also good, the music can be heard almost during whole film because there are not many dialogues.
In my opinion, this film is really gripping and spectacular. Every aspect of the film is really good. However, I found Matt Damon's performance the best thing about the film. Overall, it is a really enjoyable film."
" SO STRESSFUL
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,9,This movie just has every emotion there could possibly be!
" Best SiFI
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,10,"Best SIFI movie ever,
Mat Damon nailed the perfect astronaut for NASA..."
" It is entertaining, and sometimes it is fun, but if it were more dramatic it would have worked even better.
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,6,"I confess that I was not very impressed with this film. Presented as a space drama, I thought it would be something more tense than it is. And although it was also advertised as a scientifically accurate and credible, I confess that I was not very convinced, but I will not discuss it either.This film has a simple script: in the future, a mission manages to set up a space base on Mars, but has to retreat in haste when a heavy storm catches them by surprise. During the withdrawal, one of the elements is picked up by debris and disappears. However, he survives and begins to rebuild the base and try to stay alive and communicate with Earth where, however, and by chance, they discover he is alive. After some communications, NASA decides that the remaining elements of the expedition, already on their way to Earth, have the right to know what is going on and to take part, if they wish, in the effort to rescue him.Ridley Scott doesn't seem like a competent director for a film like this. I think it gave the film a tone too light, removing drama and tension. There are some moments, closer to the end, when he still tries to reverse it, but he can't and the climax is bad, although the film ends up decently entertaining us. Growing potatoes on Martian soil is something that would never have crossed my mind. I don't know how easily it would work, even if it is possible. Surviving in inhospitable places is never easy, especially for someone who has never had to, and if that is valid in our world, it would be even more valid on a strange planet. Ignoring all this, based on a theory and forgetting how difficult it is to put into practice, the film makes everything easy to do and, instead of a tense life or death situation, gives us a vacation in a Scout camp on Mars. Oh, and it is obvious that China, a dictatorship led by a madman with ambitions to control the world in the same way that he controls the life and freedom of his people, had to appear and show how, at the right time, it is capable of saving everyone and being essential to democratic countries.The cast's work is quite good. Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain are the main protagonists of this film and have put a lot of effort into their characters. This is quite obvious, and to be expected from two talented actors as they have proven themselves to be. Matt Damon, in particular, impresses his character with sympathy and seems to be a kind of ""our friendly neighbor"". Sean Bean also shone in his role, and makes a good counterpoint to the character of Jeff Daniels, who excels at the arduous task of becoming an obnoxious NASA director; Donald Glover, Kristen Wiig, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan and even Chiwetel Ejiofor made a positive contribution, but the film is not theirs to shine.Technically, the film is extraordinary and had a budget to bet high. So what we have is an extraordinarily realistic set, costumes and props, combined with superb cinematography, where Mars looks beautiful, sharp and convincing. All the visual effects and CGI are good and combine very well with the rest. The soundtrack is within the expectations, in a film that does not seem to be taken seriously."
" Bravo Matt Damon
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,9,"Primarily the only actor on screen for most of the movie is Matt Damon. He is superb in the role! I was not initially interested in seeing The Martian, but so glad that I did. Matt Damon joins the club of he and Tom Hanks - Two Actors who can carry a movie alone on screen, Tom did in Castaway. Damon and the movie deserved all of its Oscar nominations."
" Alone in space ..scary thing
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,8,Too late ..honest to watch this movie ..but it just entertaining and tense ..good job with actor matt damonn ..
" Great, realistic enough Sci-Fi movie
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,9,"This is a great sci-fi movie that's realistic enough to not be weighed down by being unrealistic or ridiculous in that way.The acting and plot are great. The story is engaging, and Matt Damon does a great job in playing a character that everyone is trying to save (he always seems to be playing a character that everyone is trying to save or everyone is trying to kill)
One thing that I do think weighs this movie down, and why it's a 9/10 and not a 10/10, is all the swearing. I can understand some swearing here and there, but it does get to a point in the Martian that the swearing feels gratuitous and can detract a bit to a lot from the viewing experience depending on how much you do or don't mind swearing in movies.
Other than that I'd say the movie is fairly accurate to the book, and it's extremely well done, and is a definite must watch if you like it when movies at least try to put a good effort into being as realistic as possible.9/10 would recommend."
" One of Ridley Scott's best!
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,8,"To summarise THE MARTIAN in a sentence, I consider it to be the quintessential N.A.S.A movie. It's a film about space, about the science and logistics behind space travel, how the media responds to off-world emergencies and finally, of course, Mars. Despite what the name may entail, this film is not about little green men brandishing ray guns that get their kicks by sucking out our brain stems and blowing up rural farms - this is a film about man's will to survive by outsmarting the odds he has been handed.
Performed brilliantly by Matt Damon, astronaut Mark Watney is left stranded on Mars by himself after an accident forces his crew off the planet, believing him to be dead. This film is set in the far future, and apparently in a time period where travel to and from Mars is possible, yet time-consuming. What could very easily be a film about a man twiddling his thumbs on a dust-ball planet speaking into a video diary is in fact a very excellent sci-fi adventure that I think anybody who appreciates well-crafted cinema can enjoy. The film, while filled with science-y mumbo-jumbo, is a lot more exciting than that may make it sound. I thoroughly believe THE MARTIAN will be hailed as a modern-day classic in ten or fifteen years, and we'll be showing it to our kids. It is family-friendly (with perhaps very little cussing), intense in one scene but happy and funny in the next, and you'll be with Watney in his million-mile isolation all the way. You truly want to see how (and if) he can escape Mars before he succumbs to starvation, a lack of oxygen, or even his own mind.
Jeff Daniels also lends a decent performance as N.A.S.A's director, pressured by the media's incessant interrogations and the financial/moral burden of choosing to either save a single man, or just forget about him. To top it all off, the visual presentation is stunning here, and you could really believe they shot it on location on Mars! Or, ahem... a really big desert on Earth.
This is based off of Andy Weir's 2011 novel of the same name, which I still have to read; but I am tempted to believe this is a faithful adaptation due to its critical success. And who should direct a brilliant sci-fi movie like this except for the man who gave us eternal classics like ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER? Ridley Scott, despite being as old as God these days, still has a cutting-edge professionalism about him, and you could believe the movie was put together by a young guy if you didn't know who Scott was.
I am very grateful to have seen this movie in the cinema back in 2015, when everyone was talking about it, but it isn't too late for you to check this movie out yourself now. So go slip on your astronaut gear, depressurise your room, and bring him home!"
" Ridley proving himself once again
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,9,"Strong, well-executed, moving. Classic Scott-style directing, with its fast pace, yet never leaving emotion behind, keeping you glued to the screen throughout the runtime. Reminiscent of the original Alien, yet clearly proving the director's overall increased maturity and experience. My thoughts on the cinematography are mixed, from the one hand side the movie features a particularly bland color palette, most sequences however are nice, vivid and well-balanced. What strikes me the most is the fact that they didn't account for the reduced gravity on Mars, however not only is the price cut behind this clear, but also you forget it surprisingly easily in the first 10 minutes or so, since everything else is so gripping. The visual effects are simply flawless, realistic to the maximum and beautiful at the same time. The story itself and the characters are simply masterful, not at all out-of-this-world, or should i say the way facts are presented combined with the pacing makes you believe it's all happening at the time you're watching the movie. Though i am probably not meant to make this comparison, it leaves (in my humble opinion) Nolan's ""Interstellar"", a great movie on its own, completely in the dust, simply proving the effect Scott's experience has had on his work. A must-watch."
" Great movie
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,10,"Great movie, like to think as realistic as it can be. I love performance by Matt Damon, Chiwetal Ejiofor, Jeff's Daniels and Jessica Chastain."
" Excellent story, triumphal ending!
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,9,"No matter how many times I watch this movie, it never fails to make me laugh at the humorous parts, cry at the sad or frustrating parts, and cheer at the triumphs. An excellent movie, from start to finish. Ignore the criticism that seems to stem towards good science fiction and watch it!"
" Excellent
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,10,"Have seen this film a number of times and despite a few, very few dialog clunkers on of the best I have seen in a long, long time. Entertaining and you learn something! Major take-away is how optimistic the filmmakers were regarding China. They (China) generously offer to share technology (not gonna spoil it) and are heralded as heroes. vs today as they selfishly refuse to contain and thus unleash a virus and pandemic that kills millions without repercussion."
" Goosebumps
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,10,"I watch this film because I heard about the amazing reviews. But in the end end up giving me major goosebumps, it may have been one of the best films I've ever watched. The suspense kills you. I highly recommed."
" Disturbing propaganda elements
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,6,"I truly enjoyed the film and found it excellent and untertaining untl the very disturbing and ridiculous parts about chinese good guys saving the mission...This is pure propaganda, exactly like in ""Gravity"" by the way and this is very disturbing. Without it, I would give a 9..."
" The sad decline of Ridley Scott
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,1,"I don't like swearing in my write ups but The Martian is sh#t, literally, as that's what Matt Damon uses to save his life from starvation when he's stranded on Mars, to grow potatoes. The dialogue could have been written by an 11 year old. To excite us, Damon, being stranded, announces with all the gravitas of Clark Kent changing into Superman, I'm a botanist. Wowee!! The excitement only goes down from there. What Jessica Chastain is doing in this rubbish is beyond me and she should delete it from her CV. Watch Molly's Game for a cracking performance from Jessica. One of my all time favourite British stars, Sean Bean is the only personality on screen who actually doesn't look like a dummy. Terrible infant school implausibility is relentless. Old Matt, and he is looking older, when faced with certain death from pressure failures, solves them time and again by sticking duct tape over all punctures, cracks and splits. Everyone is relentlessly cheerful and being told that they will have to stay in space for a further year and a half, the 6 crew who abandoned Matt after an accident blew him away, sit around a table, do a high five, and cheerfully agree Matt must be saved at all costs. Perhaps he told them he's an eccentric millionaire and would reward them if they save him if he gets into trouble. I never worked with any group of people, ever, who seemed loyal like this. Hollywood has gone so woke now that the cast has been picked from most nationalities on planet earth. I couldn't believe that any of this could happen, from the pseudo science to the drivel the cast has to utter. Mars looks like Monument valley, except that it's red and I expected the Indians to attack his Mars buggy at any moment. I thought Alien was the best Sci-fi ever, Gladiator good but overrated but Ridley Scott has had his best day now and shouldn't attempt anything like The Martian again. AWFUL."
" Cheer up everyone..
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,8,"Just a gentle reminder that this is fiction and not based on a true story!
Some of the reviews here are as laughable! Insulting those who found the film entertaining..
The movie is well put together, casted brilliantly, matt plays the role superbly. Sure we know it's unlikely anyone could really grow food on Mars, we also understand that there are some plot holes but again this is fiction, Hollywood! A true story would be nasa realising he's alive and covering it all up whole leaving him there to die but that wouldn't make a good film would it.. ""yep he's alive, oh well, he's stuck there so stick with the story that he died"" the end..
The pace is fast, you don't have to wait long for the action to start, it's simple enough for everyone to follow and enjoy, make your own mind up. Overall I enjoyed it alot. My only disappointment was that they didn't explore the isolation one would feel. If they'd have gone abit darker and maybe added some scenes of a man broken by isolation, fighting his own sanity while trying to survive then it definitely would have been a 10/10 but I do understand why they didn't. It's a feel good film not a doom and gloom. Worth a watch tho."
" Where no man has gone before...
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,9,"THE MARTIAN (2015) is the brainchild of Andy Weir, who developed the novel from his website. Thoroughly grounded in fact and a fast paced read, it is a no-brainer that this is a fit candidate for being transferred to film. First recommended by a friend of mine, I enjoyed the trials and plucky 'can-do' approach and attitude of our man stranded on Mars. It's an entertaining story heavy on obstacles seemingly overwhelming and insurmountable, which our lone hero confronts with workmanlike efficiency and gallows wit.Matt Damon effectively conveys what it's like to be left in the midst of a dust storm on a red world without hope and no direction home. He is half believing he will get out of this cosmic pickle and half believing he won't, but committed to keeping himself busy with the task of survival just to have something to do in the meantime. What the audience is privileged to witness therefore is a bravura display of scientific and technological literacy in action. Astronaut Mark Watney may or may not be doomed, but he's going to work the problem down to the nub just in case the cards fall his way.While back on Earth, having missed his funeral with full honors, he finds a way through hand-written signs and hexadecimal code to contact NASA and the Mars Mission Director Vincent Kapoor as played with anxious reserve by Chiwetel Ejiofor. What comes next is a series of politically incorrect actions both on Earth and Mars as Watney boils hot over the fact that the Hermes crew has not been alerted that he is still alive. Since he was the Mission's Botanist, he spends much of his ingenuity and time growing a potato crop while he calculates how to manage the remainder of the departed crew's provisions.Conditions being what they are on Mars, he receives a stinging bite of Murphy's Law when he least expects it. While a rescue attempt spearheaded hastily by NASA director Teddy Sanders, played by Jeff Daniels, who evenly withstands insubordination and time pressures with a tight lip, goes up in smoke after liftoff.
But just as the curtains seem to close on our man Watney's window of opportunity, the China National Space Administration steps up to the plate in the personages of Eddie Ko Hung and the beautiful Zhui Tao. Astrodynamist Rich Purnell as played with geeky naivete' by Danny Glover, has a Eureka moment and explains in a way a child can understand how a 'slingshot' method using Earth's gravity can be used to rescue Watney two years ahead of schedule.Meanwhile, the Hermes crew, after a skull session about the initially rejected Purnell plan, sent to them on the downlow, decide to risk being court-martialled and to go back to rescue Watney. The final scenes show Commander Lewis, as played by Jessica Chastain, exercising the right stuff and giving you a glimpse as to how the first female President of the United States would handle a crisis in a pinch. Watney takes a note from Marvel Comics and the whole world rejoices while director Ridley Scott brings the music up with a swell.Read the book and see the film. That way you will double you pleasure and double your fun. You may even be inspired to join NASA and get yourself to Mars."
" Movies worth watching.
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,9,"This movie is a very good movie, creating a good mood allows the viewer to have fun with the characters, creating a thrilling atmosphere. Even if the villain does not act against the characters, it can cause a state of shock in many scenes, I like it.I've watched the movie five times and never got bored. It's one of my favorite sci-fi movies, and I thank you instead of not keeping Sean Bean from dying in this movie."
" An amazing film
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,9,The actors are very well cast and the acting is amazing the cinematography and shot composition are amazing and very well made the sory in interesting and i was never bored although it tries and fails to be funny.
" Good but blatant pandering to China
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,7,"Good film, first half better than the second. Loses a point though for blatant pandering to China for commercial reasons."
" Funny
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,7,"An interesting movie. He may be better than Gravity, but weaker than Interstellar. Separately, it was a little long and sugary at times.
I have to find my physics textbooks that the winds on Mars surprised me, and free spaceflight is clearly not just Princess Leia's patent."
" An uplifting celebration of the human mind
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,7,"An exciting survival movie that takes on the theme of exploring and settling on Mars from a positive and optimistic lens that celebrates human reason, intelligence and the technologies that it brings us. The protagonist shows great heroism as he takes on the challenges of life.You should watch it."
" Ridley pro domo
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,8,"One real but clever blockbuster, which in an interesting way represents an ancient story of survival and keeps your attention all the time. One smooth, intelligent and fun story, Martian Robinson Crusoe.A cup of mulled wine.It is that kind of film, but in a specific environment, with specific solutions, action, SF, but also a real human drama and with a nice message in the end.It has its flaws, but the wine gets you.Ridley for entire family."
" Awesome movie
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,8,"It is one is the best space movie, it is awesome how he survives in the Mars for so many days."
" Fine entertainment
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,9,"It'll never win any awards for philosophy but it's first-class entertainment, engaging and gripping. And, as you would expect from Ridley Scott, the settings are entirely convincing: you can really believe that you are on Mars, or in a space ship. Not sure the physics of the denoument really hangs together but so what? Great fun, great storytelling, great spectacle."
" Best black movie
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,8,One of the best space film. I really loved with the main character through out the story flow hope that's the main success of the movie and direction. Overall twice and thrice watchable
" A sci fi masterpiece
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,10,"This review will be short and sweet but pretty much everyone brought it. From the acting, the story, the cinematography, this film was a masterpiece in every possible way."
" Who Doesn't Like This Movie?
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,9,"The Martian is a clever, sophisticated movie, designed for the viewer who knows how to read!
This is NOT a baddies v goodies melodrama.Realistic science incorporated into a desperate plea for a man to get back home, using his brain.Its quality story telling that latches you to our protagonist as he moves back and forth between success and failure.Will he find a way home?A must watch!"
" Marvelous! One of the best astronout films ever.
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,10,"I enjoyed this film so much. It's really a great experience to see how an astronaut has to survive on Mars on his own for months. The best part for me is the potato farming (wonderful imagination that potato plant grows on mars).
Sophisticated things about space job is made easy in this movie so we can keep on watching without being confused.
The drama is beautiful. The ending made my tears roll. Thank God it's a happy ending!"
" A family movie
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,7,"Okay enough of the negative reviews. I don't know what's with people how miserable they are or want to be to not like a tinch of comedy in a movie? I mean, seriously?? Complaining about comedy in a movie? Don't you occasionally joke in your lives? If not, go see a doctor!It's definitely not a very accurate or 'how it should have been' movie, compared to something like Interstellar. But it is a great watch nonetheless. The less science in the scripts makes it a light family movie. Visuals are just amazing. Not all but some actors have done great work- Jessica Chastain and Sean Bean standout. And Matt is Matt."
" Real life
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,6,"I feel like in real life, even with nice people in the world, they would just leave him there. Too much money to spend saving one person. Think of all the other people on Earth in worse situations."
" Was expecting more....
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,6,"I was expecting more from this movie. It was directed by the famous Ridley Scott but he was not able to give what we were expecting. It's so frustrating when so many people like and praise a movie that really doesn't deserve it.There are so many non-sensical depictions of the physics of space travel. The script seems written more by market researchers than a screenwriter. The pacing is not good. Film slows down at many points and is unnessarily stretched. It could have been shorter, it didn't deserve 2hr 30min runtime. Matt Demon's performance and special effects were good. Only, these two things were good in the whole movie.Overall, I am not saying that it is a bad movie but it had a lot of potential and could have been made better."
" A Space movie which is not about space but Humanity
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,10,"This motivational movie is all about the human's spirit of never giving up. It also reminds us that human life is precious which we often forget in our daily routines. This movie is not just for space science lovers but for everyone who wants to take a rollercoster ride on human ability turning failures into the success. We do neglect plants and air back on earth but the Mars reminds us that they are the base of our existence! The movie is surprisingly funny, emotional and it makes you jump and clap for the scientists who works hard 24x7 to add new pages to our science books."
" I didn't want it to end
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie is one of those movies that you wish never would end. It is like an amazing book that you can't put down. When the movie ends, the magic ends. When you see a movie for the first time, it won't be the same the 2nd or 3rd. If This movie has everything you want in a movie. You are glued to your screen/TV etc. There are no boring scenes in this movie. Matt Damon played his part perfectly. I also enjoyed seeing Michael Peña in this. Pena was so funny in this movie.I didn't even know where those 2hours and 24 minutes went? I was so into this movie. This movie really has a way to pull you in. Anyhow without writing any spoilers, I totally recommend you watching this. Enjoy every single minute of this movie!!!"
" Even in the most adversity, do the work it it could save you.
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,10,"A team of astronauts leave Mars due to an abrupt storm alert and evacuate. However, during the evacuation process, one of the astronauts, Mark Watney, is hit with an antenna and left for dead during the storm by his team. Mark survives the storm and realizes he is alone on Mars. Mark realizes he needs to do what he can to stay alive. He needed to get to work.
Back on earth the Director of NASA, Teddy Sanders, has announced the death of Mark Watney and that NASA is not under heavy scrutiny. Not knowing that Mark is actually making his own plans up in Mars for survival. Mark is a Botanist and is preparing to plant potatoes for food. With all of Mark's activities, Mindy Park was able to notice that Mark was actually alive at Mars and brings it to Teddy, Vincent (Director of Mars Missions) and Annie's (Director of Media Relations) attention so they can address the public that, they made a big mistake Mark Watney is actually alive.
Now that NASA knows that Mark is on Mars, there is one issue. NASA cannot communicate with him. However, Mark again, did the work and located the Pathfinder on Mars. This is a devise that would help Mark communicate with NASA. It has its setbacks as it was built in 1996 and is a still camera. It doesn't stop Mark, he does the work and hexadecimal system. Devises a system that they can communicate with a still camera and later hack into the pathfinder for better communication.
NASA tries to devise a plan to bring Mark back home. After a failed attempt of sending supplies, Rich Purnell in Astrodynamics comes up with a plan for Marks return. It is like the film Interstellar. They look to Cooper to find a solution for humanity survival. Mark's crew (Commander Melissa Lewis, Martinez, Beth Johanssen, Chris Beck, and Alex Vogel) goes against NASA and goes after their crew member.You see Mark remotely being launched from Mars with the velocity and G-force that makes him pass-out and then the director has been able to show you Mark in space with the debris slowly hitting his helmet in slow motion. It is indicating the ""no gravity"" that space has, even though he is still traveling at a high velocity of speed. He takes his own destiny in his own hands (literally) and pieces his glove and ""flies like Ironman"" to Commander Lewis. Mark never gives up. He does the work to get to his crew and stay alive."
" Superb!
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,10,"I am not the biggest fan of Matt Damon, but his performance in this was brilliant. I was a bit concerned it was going to be boring but it was very entertaining. Great story and acting - it was quite believable except for the bit at the end (the whole 'catching' thing- thought that was a bit unnecessary. Aside from that I would say this is one of the best films I have seen for a few years, only wish I'd watched it sooner!"
" A refreshing recreation of one of cinema's most enjoyable genres
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,9,"Ridley Scott is one of those directors who require no introduction for anyone remotely familiar with cinema's greatest achivements. As the creative mind behind two universally approved science-fiction masterpieces, it's hard not to get excited about his new return to the genre, even if his previous couple of works have been somewhat lackluster (looking at you: ""Exodus: Gods and Kings"").
As great as it was to hear that he'll be working with Matt Damon, one of the most instantly likeable and relatable actors working nowadays, it was also a bit disconcerning to realise how ordinary the premise is, especially in comparison with at the time revolutionary space-horror claustrophobia of ""Alien"" and the fascinating philosophical futurism of ""Blade Runner"". After actually seeing the film, however, one of the most ecstatic realisations I had as an audience member was how aware Mr. Scott was of the mediocrity of the films' ""what"", which allowed him to concentrate on a truly awe-inspiring approach to its' ""how"".
Some of the negative reviews have pointed out how the film's tone is either lacking or inconsistent. Those who hold that grudge are, to my mind, missing the point, for it is exactly this consistent inconsistency that makes this film so refreshing, compelling and entrancing. The humour here is incredibly powerful, in a way that's impossible to achieve without a skilled execution by the actors, but the biggest contributor here is the script which rises to screwball/buddy film level of wittiness that's incredibly difficult to find in modern films, let alone science-fiction ones. The protagonist refuses to spend the film reveling in the cliched mental processes of depression and contemplation expected from someone in his situation; he approaches every problem he encounters knowingly, analitically and scientifically to the best of his ability, dealing with the potential for failure with a humoruous easiness that's inherent to his refreshingly optimistical personality. The banter of our Earth characters is mixed with detailed explanations of the plot which creates a near-perfect combination of exposition and entertainment.
This in no way means that the film is, as the Golden Globes would have you believe, a comedy (or better yet, a musical, although its pop-heavy soundtrack is also unexpectedly inspired); it creates some deeply emotional and intense sequences (especially at the beginning and the end) in which nothing is funny and everything is investing exactly because of how they are contrasted to the films' frequent easy-going moments.
But what truly completes this experience, in between all the great work done by actors (especially Damon, Bean and Daniels) and the writer, it is the visuals which truly cement this film in your brain, for the yellow, red and orange colours of the fields and mountains of Mars have rarely been more enchantingly poetic. Like the music becomes its own character in Leone's westerns, here the planet acts as a vast and powerful force of self-assured emptiness, constantly reminding the viewer of the fact that this film does, in fact, have a villain, and it is just as compelling and relentless as some of cinemas' most clearly motivated monsters."
" A major space movie, a moving sci-fi
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,10,"What a strong film! Visually beautiful, good and credible story, very moving, espectator never gets tired, great characters and dialogs. I cannot find any mistake in the while film, which did impact me. One of the best space movies ever, for sure. You do find yourself hoping for their success. You do imagine that situation, in all details, as something possible in near future."
" It's a typical hi-quality Scott product; could've been 9 but it diluted too much
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,7,"OK. Damon's talent is that he goes from ""regular guy"" to ""serious guy with issues"" very convincingly - logical that he got the Lead and carried it out well. This is a Scott movie, so very well shot (he doesn't do bad visuals, ever) and mostly a visual treat. The storyline's OK, but it seems to rush/crash through the script, leaving little room for development, pathos, contemplation, emotional complexity - which you would think being stranded on Mars would produce. Challenge is to establish: crew mates, disaster, politics, technology, plan, drama, solution...but hardly any elemenet gets the space (pun intended) to grow. Maybe Money-Men were in charge of the edit because an excellent movie was probably left on the cutting room floor."
" It's OK but overrated
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,6,'The Martian' isn't a bad movie at all but I do think it's overrated. A running time of 2 hours 30 minutes is too long and it could have been 20 minutes shorter.THE GOOD. It looks great. The acting is reasonably solid and the story does keep you watching.THE BAD. Predictable. I kept watching really hoping that the ending would surprise and shock me but it was boringly and disappointingly as expected. A lot of technical talk which went way over my head. I also never really got a sense that Matt Damon was ever in grave danger which I thought would be the main theme of the movie. As mentioned earlier the movie is too long.BONUS MARK. i was toying with a mark of 5 or 6 but decided on 6 due to Jessica Chastain's lovely smile.
" Really enjoyable
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,8,"A good space film, never got bored and was great to see what life stranded on mars could be like"
" A feel good movie
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,8,"""Robinson Crusoe"" meets ""Apollo 13."" Where are the little green men? The tripods spitting death rays? Just kidding. An earlier movie, ""Robinson Crusoe on Mars"" (1964), was made before the first moon landing and depicted an astronaut surviving on the Red Planet. That film, however, followed the Daniel Defoe plot device, with alien slavers and a companion named ""Friday,"" etc. This version is more realistic. Astronaut presumed dead is left behind when his crewmates are forced to abandon the planet due to weather conditions. Fortunately, our hero is a botanist and eternal optimist and survives, growing potatoes in human feces, and manages to make contact with NASA. Including the initial storm that started the problem, only three crises (all mechanical) are encountered and overcome. It's a feel good movie that I only found objectionable in two places: at one point it jumps ahead seven months with no sense of time passing other than our hero growing a beard. And in the end, with the world watching on TV around the globe, he is rescued. Because the Chinese helped in the rescue effort by using their previously top-secret technology, you would think that future endeavors would be more international in scope (as they are now, in actuality). But the next launch at the end of the film is celebrated as ""America is going back to Mars!"""
" 9/10
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,9,"It's an amazing movie that has managed to have a little of all the genres, and i really like how they have a youtube channel where you can get a little bit more content"
" Phenomenal
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,10,One of the if not the best movie I have a remember seeing. I loved it.
" Mind blowing flim I ever see
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,9,"A flim that blow my mind, how can a director think like that?"
" Implausible and scientifically inept
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,5,"Where to start. Mars has almost no atmosphere so there could NOT be a violent windstorm that would carry someone several meters. This is one of the most glaring errors in the movie yet it is the basis for the entire move.If something punctures an environment suit the inside pressure is so much greater blood would not seal the breach before all the air escaped. Even if for some reason the person survives and makes it back to the hab module they would either bleed out or get some infection that kill them.Pulling 12Gs during the launch would be Martian Gs not earth Gs. Given Mars relatively weak gravity, it would be less than Earth 5Gs which a trained astronaut can handle without passing out.Growing any plant in alien soil no matter how much human waste you use would not yield the same effects as on Earth. The fruit at best would not support human life or even poisonous. Further, generating hydrogen and then burning it using hab oxygen would be counterproductive. It would take twice as much oxygen as hydrogen to make water which would reduce the amount of oxygen available to support human life.Poking a hole in the glove of an environment suit in space would depressurize the suit in milliseconds due to the high pressure difference. Think popping a balloon. There would be no ""thrust"" so the person could ""fly like Ironman.""The return spaceship's wheel does not rotate fast enough to generate even a weak gravitational field. The wheel would have a radius of 226k meters and rotate at 12 rpm to generate 1 Earth G. If the wheel is smaller the speed has to be faster which could cause motion sickness in the crew.There are many more glaring problems, but these are the most obvious. Next time someone wants to make a movie about being on Marts, GO TO MARS."
" Matt Damon is always good.
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,9,It's a weird movie to like but you do. Maybe it's because of Matt Damon? I got addicted at some point. It's miserable though. I don't know. I liked it. Go watch it. LOL
" The best movie about space ever made 8/10
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,8,"The Martian is a perfect and extraordinary movie. The amount of accuracy it has towards the laws of physics and space is tremendous and well made. You can tell by the film that the crew worked harder than ever to make this movie full of accuracy, the spacecrafts, the rovers, the differences between earth and mars, the calculation and how the crew members solve their problems. Everything seems so real and accurate that you need to take a moment to appreciate it. Even the cast is amazing: Matt Damon giving one of his best performances yet, Jessica Chastain, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Sean Bean are amazing actors who all participate in this film and have done a great job. Donald Glover appears as well and steals the show as always. The script written by Drew Goddard is well appreciated, it's a fantastic script that gives the basis for this film. What I love so much about the film is the journey Mark Watney goes through, he is stranded on a planet where nothing grows, no life forms, all alone plus he needs to survive on his own with the skills he's got. It's a story of survival in space and how a person should never give up so easily. A scene I like to keep in mind with is the last scene of the movie where Mark Watney teaches his class of how to survive in space and what he has learned from his experience. The scene feels like a summary of the movie and Watney's journey as a character or a ""space pirate""."
" Clever, funny, and believable.
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,9,"I was sceptical when I first read the film reviews. Then I watched it.If you happen to have watched the Netflix drama-documentary about the first Mars mission, this is very much in the same headspace. A very simple premise, and a completely engaging response.Damon holds you as the mission botanist accidentally left behind, from the moment he staggers back to the basecamp and (clearly) uses the mission training to keep himself together. <Folks, they are not going to send anyone there who would nt be able to cope. Might make good cinema but really duff for this plot>Carefully crafting together the Mars Pathfinder and the Ares missions, along with very sold science - ASCII codes for the letters of the alphabet to spell with, hexadecimal for the firmware coding of the rover, burning the hydrazine for water, fertilising the dead soil to grow potatoes - the steps of the huge operation to keep him alive and recover him work well.The soundtrack to the film is first class, along with Watney's dry commentary about disco. Keeping the referencing current is a great way hold and carry the audience.Lots of subtle points along the way and a lot of carefully observed, and realistic reactions and commentary. The moment they realise that the two photos show Watney moving things, having just announced his death; the reaction of Watney to being told that his cewmates don't know yet; the scene where Purnell (tech) explains to Sanders (NASA boss) exactly how to turn the mission upside down to save Watney; Watney decidig to declare himself the first Martian, and asking NASA to call him Captain Longbeard. And many more.....A great film to watch even if you don't normally bother with Sci-Fi."
" Written so damn goood !!!!!!!!!!
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,"To begin with i honestly had no interest watching this movie in the first place. Cauz i was fed up with some mediocre space movies in the recent times with very bad writing despite the visuals being good. But this one was a pleasant surprise for me. Yes the movie is predictable as most movies are. What can you possibly write in a script with a plot of leaving a person behind in a planet. All the lead actors did their part convincingly to pull this insane ride (Mostly it was Matt Damon, a one man show i would say). The visuals were great. Despite of the 2 plus hours of running time the movie was in a great pace. Leaving you wanting more of it. Personally i was hoping a bit more of Matt Damon's after rescuing portions where he could share those memories with his people. Go watch it."
" It's great, but I wish it was more serious.
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,6,"It was surprisingly comedic film. I think most of humor don't fit in the film. As for everything other, the special effects were amazing. I loved when the film was about the survival of the martian, but after halfway through it started to drag, not suprising the lenght of it is 2h24min, I'd say 20 minutes too long. Still, I can recommend this film, the protagonist was great and I loved watching how he was trying to survive in mars."
" good movie from start to beginning
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,10,"I saw The Martian Author mentioned in YouTube talking about The Martian exactly last year after watching Wolf of Wall Street. And here I am now, watched the movie after 1 year. Good movie from start to finish. I liked Matt Damon's performance he did really well. I also liked the plot, great plot. I also especially liked Vincent, he was a great character for the movie."
" Was kind of hoping for a different ending
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,6,"My brother made me watch this, I wish they had left Mark Watney on Mars! Many better movies about the red planet."
" Science got right.
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,10,"As a science and movie geek, this was a gold mine.The movie starts with a bang, doesn't waste that many minutes and goes to full thriller mode. Even the 'medical' scene of him taking out the rod was well acted and intense. Got so many goosebumps when Matt's first discovery was found by NASA.The concept of Cast Away meets Apollo 13 is great. Props to the original writer and adapters to faithfully keeping most of it.Cinematography was great, made boring desert Mars look stunning, praises for the direction by Ridley Scott has nothing to add more for his rich career.I thought it was only ganna be Matt Damon but boy was I wrong. Movie nerd inside me brust open when I saw that humangase of a cast.Jessica Chestain,Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan(Bucky) and Micheal Pena(Luizzz) in the main crew. The relationship set up between the crew was well executed without that much scenes, build up, at the start.Chiwetel Ejiofor is fantastic, his protrayal of helpful and caring person was phenomenally done. Jeff Daniels as NASA Director stole some scenes for me at the start with his rude caricature. Wong and Donald Glover had short but very effective scene time. Sean Bean not dying has no scientific explanation.All the NASA scenes, Mars scenes, JPL, China & Hermes working together felt great. Everybody uniting to save a human life.The movie had great sprinkles of comedy. Protagonist humourous approach to every trouble and optimistic characterisation served the themes of 'not giving up' pretty well. Looking for best in the worst of things. Hence he came back alive, cuz science.Now the sciennccce, 'The greatest botanist in this planet', 'Botany isn't science.' Using radioactive decay to solve cooling problem, using own waste as fertilizers was fantastic, making H2O from N2H2 and blowing himself up for miscalculation got the science right. Even astronomical science, rocket science had some realism in them. Blowing up Hermes and poking space suit for thrust as Iron Man, superb. Mars is the name of Roman God of War, and his Greek version is called 'Ares', hence the name Ares3 4 for Mars mission. And Hermes is the Greek god of travel (also Mercury but travel seems more right)Scientists are not always crazy old dudes in white coats, they work together and solve problems. One of the few movies that got both science and scientists right."
" Somewhat entertaining
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,5,"But wrong in a number of ways. The casting. The disco music. The editing. The Martian is too long, not funny where it tries hard to be funny, and has that ""teenagers rescuing the world"" feel when you look at the other astronauts. I could go on as there is much more. Like the use of duct tape to fix every problem. On the plus side: Matt Damon is okay, the Martian landscape photography looks great, and the story in itself is a good one. But it all does not feel like a Ridley Scott Movie and is just so so. A solid 5 stars."
" Has it all!! Matt damon is brilliant!!
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,10,"Simply put extremely entertaining!! The whole cast is amazing especially Matt damon who is very underrated, his performance in this and ford vs Ferrari should have been nominated for an oscar but as always the best either dont get nominated at all or dont win!!"
" Ridley Scott proves once again he values story more than visuals.
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,9,"I am a sucker for sci-fi big spectacle and CGI fest films, even if many of them are predictable, unoriginal, and boring. However, The Martian brings both and intriguing space travel mission mixed with a commentary on modern society in terms of morality and survival. This is balanced out by a beautifully done script that manages to be both suspenseful and comedic, the performances by the whole cast, and obviously the amazing visual effects and cinematography.The only complaint I have is that it is too long, and at times it becomes repetitive and therefore somewhat boring. However, it is only for a short amount of time and it does not become prevalent in the whole film.A"

" A joy to watch
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,7,"It is such a joy to watch a director as talented as Ridley Scott do his thing. He knows how to keep tension and interest like a master. He is a wizard and he has wizarded up a movie to sweep you up into a roller coaster of emotion. No matter how obvious the story or how iffy the logistics in the story his work is a delight. This is the tale of an astronaut left for dead on Mars who survives the catastrophe thought to kill him. Once NASA realizes he's alive, and once they announce that find, the whole world watches every step in the many-months long struggle to find a way to bring him home. The work is done by NASA and CNSA on earth and by the lone astronaut/scientist on Mars in tandem."

" Great Space film
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,10,"This movie has given me an opportunity to see Mars from the lens of Matt Damon. What a beautiful Mars. So much motivational, & survival movie it is. Highly ambitious tasks executed by crew members of the spacecraft. Very meticulously directed. Graphics are highly qualitative. What else?? The movie is a celebration of life, a celebration of success, a celebration of wit and intelligence."
" Is this a parody?
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,5,"When this movie came out I heard only good things about it. I thought this would be a rather realistic, thought-provoking and dramatic survival story that would make me emotional because it's so well done. What I got was a comedy movie with unbelievable bad dialogues like I have seen and heard them only in very low budget horror/splatter movies. I refuse to believe that grown-ups are laughing at those jokes. The portrayal of the emotions was badly done. Very, very badly. The characters lacked any personality. There was no soul, no depth, no character you could get invested. Everything was extremely shallow and forced-funny.
5 stars because of the landscape and everything else. The concept was nice and interesting. The acting was okay. The writing brought this movie down."
" The Most Unsatisfying SyFy Movie On This Or Any Other Planet
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,1,"As a thinking adult, I strongly felt that ""The Martian"" (with its dismal PG-13 rating) had totally short-changed me (in a big-big way) by handing me a story that was clearly meant to entertain youngsters who obviously couldn't have cared less about plot-line intelligence or coherency.(IMO) - ""The Martian's"" story-line was so predictable and so riddled with annoying cliche that I'm convinced that the only reason why Ridley Scott decided to direct this hopelessly pathetic production was to make himself a whole pile of money and the adults in the audience be damned.And, with that said - I would never, ever recommend this SyFy time-waster to anyone who I had genuine respect for.

",2020-06-22 00:00:00,9,"Hey I'd say this is probably one of the best if not the best science fiction movies I've ever seen. I'm no Astro physicist but everything seems pretty scientifically sound (except for on ship gravity). That realistic science aspect makes the movie a lot more interesting.But not only is this a good sci fi story it's a story that poses some pretty thought provoking questions. Could one person unite the world like this? Would an organization/country really spend billions of dollars just to save one man? How much is a life worth? These are all question I found myself asking. So I'd say it's a pretty though provoking film, not only in the science realm, but in the socio-political realm as well. Look at me overthinking the film, all in good fun though right friends?Very well done might I add some good comedy, fantastic visuals, excellent pacing, great actors. Except for Kristen Wigg... sad to say this ain't her type of film. I think she was kinda awkward at times. Also Donald Glover is kind of a goof. But I suppose that was the character. This is all very nit picky tho. No hate brother!"
" Fun to Watch
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,8,A film that knows how to mix humor and tension. It makes you apprehensive and curious from beginning to end!
" Damon Delivers a Powerful Performance
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,9,"This film packs quite a different punch than what I initially expected. I came into this film expecting something that was Interstellar-esque. While there were similar aspects, y'know, space and everything, (along with Matt Damon) it is a wildly different film. Just when you think things couldn't get any worse, they somehow do. But Scott certainly knows how to deliver on every type of scenes, and with his cinematics and the writing, it culminates to make quite an enjoyable watch. People may call it predictable, but everything is. A separate reviewer on here states, ""Who ever watched Star Wars with the thought that Vader would ultimately win? Who ever watched Star Trek thinking that Kirk wouldn't find a way to save the day? And frankly, who grew up watching Scooby Doo thinking that someone would actually kill Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne, or Velma???"" and I think that sums it up perfectly. Of course it's predictable! But in the moment you're so sucked up in the film that you don't think about that. Overall a phenomenal film."
" I love this film very much, but...
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,10,"...it was made in 2015, right? So why in pluperfect effing hell do we STILL have ""noisy screens,"" such that every time a character appears on a computer screen there is a sound that plays? I mean, it's not ""Telefon"" where each character was the sound effect of a 600-pound crash printer fed by a mainframe circa 1965, but it IS right up there with the opening scene of The Hunt For Red October. Really, we're still doing this? Every second grader on the planet doesn't already know that this never happens? See the movie."
" Entertaining Sci-Fi Yarn
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,7,"Think Tom Hanks in castaway and you have the same sort of story except for this is millions of miles away on Mars.
Yes it's a far fetched story however if the story wasnt a bit silly it would have been the most predictable dullest movies ever made.
Damon and the rest of the cast do a good job of making the story a good entertaining movie which essentially what it is. It's not an action movie, more a survival story.
Theres not too much realism here but the 2+ hours are enjoyable and go quite quickly.
Its definitely worth a watch if you fancy a slow but entertaining Sci-Fi."

",2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,"I read the book slightly before the movie came out, so a lot of the scenes were still fresh. I'm not one of those people that puts reading on a pedestal and snub movies. A good story is a good story, no matter the medium.The movie captured the heart of the book well, there is some evidence of hard sci-fi, all the action is pretty realistic and is very fun to watch.Damon's acting is pretty good, and most of the characters are pretty believable. Jeff Daniels was also is his very likeable Newsroom authoritative, slightly cocky character.Where I feel this is a let-down is the script: the book has a lot of funny passages and jokes that are sprinkled between technical details and the protagonist's inner battle to keep sane while dealing with disappointment. Like any other script, most of the action was summarized, while most of the humor made it. This makes the story feel more silly than it really is. It also makes the story less believable."

" Intelligent and inspiring
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,9,"This is a very well-made film in the survival genre but set in space. It really makes the most use of its setting with science based problems and solutions. I like the main character's ambition, knowledge and problem solving but sometimes he felt too perfect. The cutaways to Earth added some intrigue and drama. Overall I think this is actually better than the book because it is more streamlined."
" Amazing
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,9,"Very good movie. Terrific graphic scenes of Mars, as far as I known true to real Martian geography and landform. But I get very sick of watching Matt Damon eating and drinking, and what I take as a boastful attitude: ""I am selfish enough to want all the credit"" he says near the end. Usually I like him a lot, but in this one, I find him irritating, despite his very good acting. I wish he chewed less, and swore less.
Everything that happens is a ""long shot"", but with enough setbacks thrown in to make it realistic. Astronomy is amazing. By the way, many many discoveries Nasa have made about the planets and moons in our solar system suggest strongly that the solar system is relatively young, way less than the oft quoted 4.5 billion years. I hope we can get there one day and check these things out....Go Spacex!"
" not bad at all, stunning effects

Effects used are top notch. Some humor here and there. And most important, it's not a USA propaganda flick. Their launch exploded so the Chinese do come in to help and it works out fine. And towards the last 30 minutes there is even a lot of suspense to see.Happy to finally have seen this.

" This is a rare, light-hearted science fiction film.
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,9,"This is a rare, light-hearted science fiction film that deliberately downplays the most common fears about the future and the unknown universe, focusing instead on human effort and the science that can save humanity.The film has a tech-geek's idiocy and optimism. (Matt Damon, of course, did it perfectly.)Even if the movie is a little bit stereotypical in its emotional setting, it can still touch the audience at crucial moments."
" excellent in design, lacking in story
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,8,"The production design and cinematography is excelling, unfortunately the story is a feel good us-american patriotic film that could have been way more. The acting is on fleek on the other hand."
" Should have been better
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,7,Best part of the movie is Matt Damon's performance.Supporting cast were extremely boring and some parts of the movie just didn't work.
" It's not easy to find a sci-fi film that doesn't shed blood and is not sensational these years.
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,8,"On science fiction, Ridley Scott is much better than Nolan. Under the surface of comedy is actually an extraordinarily orthodox way of hard science fiction. It's great not to have a messy emotional line to win over the host. My favorite place is that I didn't emphasize the obsession with the earth at all in the process of survival, and the climax didn't even come back to the earth, because it didn't matter at all!"
" It is not a interstellar movie
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,8,"Good film. It has an ordinary but enjoyable scenario. Dialogues are fun. But sometimes there are very compelling events. Especially towards the end. While the scenes on Mars are very beautiful in visual effects, scenes in space are not visually, but physically ridiculous. Matt Demon played very well. There are already very famous actors in the cast, even in the smallest roles. Ripley Scott exhibited above-average directing. But it's not like an Interstellar movie. So don't keep the expectation so high. Watch if you want to watch a beautiful space movie."
" The story of hope...
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,9,"The story in brief:The man called Mark Watney from NASA's space mission gets left behind on Mars alone as a result of a tragic incident and his teammates believe that he is dead. Mark realizes that he has somehow survived through this accident & decides to survive for some more days. This hope of surviving pushes him to all his limits & come up with insane solutions, which no one would ever imagine.What this movie taught me:Even after realizing that his team has left him alone on Mars, he never blames any of his teammates
->How often we do this? We keep on blaming others for our own situationsHe uses his knowledge as a botanist to the true potential & grows potatoes on the soil of Mars with his own poop
->Did we ever think about our true potential?Once everything was set up & going as per his plan, his small experiment blows all his crops & he is back to zero again. But this doesn't stop him.
->Ups & downs are part of life, they shouldn't shake you up. The right attitude will always get you out of any troubleHe would record himself every single day with a hope that when he dies, someone would listen to his story of surviving on Mars
->Live your life as if you are writing a book, which others would love to read later onHe kept that smile on his face till the very last moment in space, when his team actually rescues him
->Appreciate & acknowledge what life has given you irrespective of your current state or what you aspire to beMy favorite line from the movie: Tell my family, that I never stopped fighting to make it home"
" I Will Survive
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,7,"Yet another movie that has recently become eerily prophetic anticipating life under lockdown is this long but effective remake of 'Robinson Crusoe on Mars' (1964), with Matt Damon forced to endure seventies disco music in confinement the way Roger Livesey had endured nineteenth century French comic opera in 'The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp'.It faithfully follows both the look and mood of the original, but with the addition of scenes back on Earth creating a ticking clock to generate suspense of the sort only too familiar to anyone who's ever had to instal a feature on their laptop or iPad while being directed by phone. While Shu Chen has been shoehorned into the plot with the Chinese market in mind as a resourceful lady scientist whose last minute inspiration helps save the day."

" Entertaining Space Adventure Overseeing A Spaceman Fighting To Survive
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,7,"Pros:
1. The costume and set design are are incredible and intricately designed.
2. The futuristic score and Disco soundtrack does a great job at suiting the space setting, as well as helping the film a lift when needed.
3. Matt Damon (Mark Watney) gives a fantastic performance.
4. The comedy is inserted well, and does an amazing job at preventing the movie from becoming too dark.
5. The cinematography is really eye-catching, especially the stunning and breathtaking shots of Mars.
6. All of the characters make intelligent and deep character decisions, which makes every decision hit harder, in addition to fully empathising with the characters and their ordeal.
7. When Mark Watney is finally reunited with Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain), it is a genuinely emotional scene.Cons:
1. There is some dodgy shaky cam in the beginning.
2. There are a couple plot-holes. For example, If NASA hates fire (including items that can contribute to fire), how come they let Rick Martinez (Michael Peña) bring a wooden crucifix to Mars? Surely they would check personal items taken by the astronauts? Another example would be the Chinese choosing to sacrifice their technology secrets to save an American astronaut; they would never do this in the real world.
3. The movie doesn't focus enough on the psychological impacts that being left alone, with very little hope of escape, on a strange planet would do to a person.
4. When narrating messages, the film bizarrely has the receiver and the sender both read out the message. You only need one.
5. Some of the characters are given very little, if anything, to do. This includes both Mitch Henderson (Sean Bean) and Annie Montrose (Kristen Wiig)."
" interesting
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,8,"This is a rare and easy science fiction film. The film deliberately weakens the most common fears of the science fiction film about the future and the unknown universe, but talks about people conquering the sky and science to save humanity. The film has the stupidity and optimism unique to the technical house (of course, this is also inseparable from Matt Damon's excellent performance). Even if the film is a bit too routine in emotional settings, it can still impress the audience at a critical moment"
" Thrilling
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,9,"Story is simple, though interesting. You suddenly start living with that character. Also get to know some facts about mars. Overall it's must watch."

Praise Two choices: either wait to die, or solve the problem, life is to constantly solve the problem and create miracles."
" Quite fresh. Loved it!
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,9,"The Martian movie is a dream come true, a faithful elucidation of the central technical dramas that made the Andy Weir novel it's based on the surprise 'space geek hit' of the decade. The tale is something of a Robinson Crusoe in space: Astronaut Mark Watney is stranded on the surface of Mars when his crew mates are forced to evacuate their habitat and blast off for Earth. Watney must improvise ways to eke out his limited resources, as the next mission to the red planet isn't scheduled to land for another four years. Like the book, the movie's rhythm is a steady cycle of crisis, recovery, humor, determination, and new crisis. On screen, directed by Ridley Scott, these cycles are delivered with satisfying characterization and eye-grabbing visuals of Martian landscapes and mouth-gaping zero-G gymnastics in space.As a backdrop to the human drama (and comedy), the movie's hardware is based on real engineering, not magical miracle machines. The Hermes mother ship, for example, is a modified version of the sound design strategy of a 'cycling spacecraft' that repeatedly makes the Earth-Mars-Earth loop with crew and small landing craft. (Buzz Aldrin and I wrote up the concept for Scientific American a decade ago.)
As the left-for-dead Watney, played by Matt Damon, faces doom in a dozen guises, he defiantly boosts his courage through styling himself as everything from the ""best botanist on Mars"" (as he ingeniously grows potatoes in carefully-created garden soil) to a ""space pirate"" (for his goal of commandeering a rescue rocket emplaced automatically elsewhere on the planet). He expresses his thoughts to his laptop log and later in messages to people on earth campaigning to rescue him. When humans finally reach other planets, we will need real ""Watneys""-those smart enough to repurpose on-hand assets in an emergency, and lucky enough not to be killed by their own inevitable oversights.Space geeks will enjoy identifying and debating technical flaws in the film. The Martian follows its source material remarkably closely, but unlike say, certain installments in the Harry Potter movie franchise, it will still make perfect sense to those who haven't read the book. Aside from the monster sandstorm that sets up the crisis (Andy Weir, the author of The Martian, is very upfront about choosing to gloss over the realities of Martian atmospheric pressure in favor of a dramatic opening), there are few noticeable factual flubs in the plot. Unlike 2013's Gravity and its magical space maneuvers, or 2014's Interstellar with its mystical time continuum tricks, this movie is a remarkably authentic exposition of what space travelers need to be able to do under crisis conditions.Run time constraints forced the movie's producers to condense and combine characters, with no real detriment to the story-although viewers might be surprised to see the same set of key NASA experts showing up at every launch or space center on the planet as the action shifts between continents. Similar story-telling imperatives probably compelled the most striking departure (spoiler alert!) from the book-changing who actually goes to rescue Watney in the end-but again, without any significant detour from the plot.There's no cheating on even highly-technical spaceflight topics, as shown in the treatment of the so-called ""Rich Purnell maneuver,"" wherein the Hermes slingshots past Earth back to Mars for a desperate pickup attempt. NASA's navigation geek Purnell-played with effective nervous energy by Donald Glover- demonstrates the ""orbitology"" of his maneuver, with two NASA officials as the planets, and a stapler and pens as spacecraft. The result is coherent, comprehensive, and surprisingly comic. The basic strategy of the Rich Purnell maneuver is not fictional-a crippled Japanese Mars probe named Nozomi actually used a similar Earth-flyby scheme to set up a second chance for its own faltering unmanned Mars mission a dozen years ago.There's one cringeworthy trope in The Martian that has apparently become an unavoidable cultural myth: the scenes where teams in Mission Control erupt into leaping cheers a few seconds after a rocket blasts off. This imaginary practice would not only be utterly unprofessional but also an indicator of near-criminal negligence. In the screening that I attended following an event at NASA's Johnson Space Center, these scenes were negatively noticed by many NASA folks in the audience. But I only can suppose it was sympathetically meant to humanize the rocket scientists, and it was the only exception to the admiration shown for all the other portrayals. (It's also possible this trope has been influenced by footage of the controllers of deep space unmanned missions in recent years, where data about events can take hours to cross the solar system, leaving controllers mostly in the position of spectators during key mission milestones.)After faithfully reproducing technically-sound crises and responses for two hours, the movie did briefly run off the track into fantasy mode at the very end, by by violating the physics of action-reaction in portraying an over-dramatized dramatic rescue attempt that really didn't need any such cheating. But if that was the price to pay for producing this otherwise magnificent space adventure story, the math checked out. Mother Nature is relentlessly unforgiving in space, but a movie audience can show a lot more mercy to one major technical transgression. I do."
" Neither one thing not another.
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,7,I enjoyed this even if it was a little long but found myself struggling to understand what it was trying to be. Its not full on Sci Fi with aliens or the supernatural but neither is it a plausible view of the future state of man's achievements. There were too many cheesy 'tech' moments where things just magically worked and coupled with the usual happy clappy the world is watching elements the edge was taken off for me.
" Wow just wow
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,9,"Was absolutely amazed by this definitely didn't feel as long as it was which was perfect. Matt Damon was brilliant absolute joy to watch. I'm annoyed it took me this long to watch this, disappointed in my self. I fully recommend this to anyone and everyone."

" Everyone's watching science fiction movies with different feelings
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,8,"The vision of ""gravity"" meets the content of ""the rest of the desert island"", and combines Wikipedia and humor properly. However, his comedy tone deprived the tension of drama, and he lacked intensity and urgency in the second half hour. In the end, he sang that the invincibility of science and technology, international cooperation and the idealization of a harmonious world seemed too ""politically correct"". Crew members and NASA officials all provide emotional interaction and unique and interesting perspectives for the monologue."
" A brilliant film
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,"No more to be said! (Ooops, IMDB says it's too short, sorry, I'm a new user). I have lost count on how many times since its release that I have watched it. In my opinion, with the films I like, it rates with Gladiator, Apollo 13, Armageddon, Forrest Gump (maybe a tad kind here) and others like this. These movies have different storylines and genres, but it is the quality of the movie and how it excites you. I know there are people who may not enjoy some of the films I have pointed out, and that's fine, we are all differnt people, but for me, this was a GREAT movie."
" The Martian is a must watch
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,"The Martian (2015) directed by Ridley Scott, is an adaptation of the novel by Andy Weir. The film stars Matt Damon as Mark Watney; Matt Damon's portrayal of the character was excellent as he clearly depicted the mental struggle of being left on a planet alone. You could see how Watney felt, the hope when things went right and the pain when everything was stacked against him, this added to the film by making the character multidimensional and truly adding a human aspect to space. The film also looks at many aspects of space travel, including the political and corporate side of space travel by showing how the commissions and the people at NASA dealt with finding out Watney was alive and how to move forward. This made the film even better as it allowed multiple aspects of the story to be examined and flushed out. The movie was very strong in how it showed the story from all angles, you could see Watney and his struggle, the crews processing the fact that Watney was alive and how NASA and the world dealt with the news of Watney. The film also excelled in its use of humor, the humor provided great contrast to the harsh reality of the film and really helped the film. There were also beautiful cinematic shots of mars that added to the film and provided great imagery as there was stark emptiness to mirror how alone Watney was, but also add a bit of irony as the beautiful place is very treacherous. The use of different camera shots added to the film, from the long cinematic views of mars, then the helmet cams, and the video ""diary"", all of these different techniques made the film come to life. All in all, the Martian features great acting, stunning cinematic work along with an excellent plot and is a must watch."

The reason being that having loved Apollo 13 and having seen numerous documentaries about a real space emergency, I found it hard to suspend my disbelief with The Martian. Watching documentary footage of real people both in NASA and among the public becoming tearful at the successful landing of Apollo 13, just made me so aware that the scenes of the public anxiously waiting for Mark Watney to be rescued weren't real. It took a number of viewings for me to finally develop that suspension of disbelief to enjoy the ending. But every time I've watched it I like it more and more. Matt Damon is fantastic and so likeable in the role. He made the movie, but I also liked Jessica Chastain, and the whole cast really."
" Utter rubish
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,3,"Started laughing about the stupidity of this movie when he used hexadecimal system. Why would I put around the camera 16 hexadecimal numbers (and representing every character in two) instead of simply 20 something alphabet characters (plus perhaps numbers)? He seemed using only the alphabet characters.Of course Chinese had to help, but only a bit, because America is great. The German guy's name is Vogel. A lady in the NASA control center asks 10 seconds before the launch of the rescue mission what can the control center do if they fail, what is she doing there? Mr guy with the plan not knowing the name of the head of NASA? Very funny. By the way how did he know when he started calculating that the Chinese would help? Mr Martian cursing as if it was supposed to be funny and after 2+ years alone does not go mad and when he finally hears a human voice and later sees a human he does what? He jokes. Sure. That's what you would do after being 2 years alone.I could not care for any character, all very shallow. But of course all very handsome.Utter rubIsh. Sci-fi for 5 year olds."

",2020-04-18 00:00:00,9,"Fascinating and enthralling tale of resourcefulness, ingenuity and survival. After a massive storm forces his crew to leave the planet, an astronaut, Mark Wat ney (played by Matt Damon), is marooned on Mars, and presumed dead. Figuring that it would be at least four years until someone can rescue him, he sets out, though often ingenious means, to survive.. A very well thought-out and made movie from director Ridley Scott. E ngrossing, engaging plot - the odds are against our hero, and you feel his plight, yet he finds ways to keep going. The resourcefulness stretches beyo nd a single man though, to the NASA, and other, people on the ground trying to get him home. This engenders a great feeling of a community of specialists working together. While I can't validate the science in the movie (I'll leave that to Neil deGrasse Tyson!), the science FEELS - there are no obvious plot holes or inaccuracies. Good performances all round, especially from Matt Damon in the lead role. Only sour note is Sean Bean's character, which came across as cartoonish. A must-see."
" Isolation even greater than what COVID can cause
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,8,"This is a space nerd's movie. This is a problem solver's movie. When you are in space you don't get emotional. You figure out what the problems are and you solve them one at a time. If you solve enough problems, then you get to come home alive. The Martian does a great job of displaying the loneliness of the situation its protagonist is in. I really appreciated that it doesn't keep you constantly worried about what the next unexpected disaster would be. It is an easy ride that introduces challenges just as swiftly as our characters solve them. The theme of isolation fit nicely into this quarantine lifestyle we are living."

This was however not possible with this film.Too often I got ""woken up"" with the next unrealistic decision making step in the story.If you are like me, a person who NEEDS the story to be plausible to enjoy it, that film is NOT for you, I promise.If however, the degree of realism in how the story develops does not bother you at all, and you have time to kill, then you might enjoy this film.3/10 for me.Not recommended"

",2020-03-30 00:00:00,3,Very boring and very predictable movie. It could have been one of the better films but it didnt live up to its expectations.
" Wisdom in adversity
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"If a movie wants to impress the audience,it doesn't have to be sensational. We can't find any traces of sensation in The Martian,but it really moved the audience because of the feelings of the actor Mark His tenacity and optimism,his unyielding beliefs,are all an essential part of real life."
" One of Ridley Scott's best
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"I was a bit skeptical with this movie going in, because of how everyone was raving about it. ""You gotta see The Martian. You gotta see The Martian."" Usually when people tell me over and over how great a film is, my expectations get a bit too high and I end up thinking the film is just OK. (This happened with ""Avatar"" and ""Gravity."") I'm happy to say that this was one of the few times where I actually agree. This movie was amazing. The problem with ""Gravity"" and ""Avatar"" for me was they weren't really that engaging. This film was. I was excited to see what what happened next. There was even a point where I paused for a lunch break, and tried to make it as quick as possible so I could see what happened next. Matt Damon is great in this. He makes you feel such levels of emotion. This definitely deserves every Oscar it gets. I'm rooting for this to bring home the gold this coming Sunday. Everything from the acting, to the cinematography, to the script is brilliant. There were one or two scenes that made me a bit squeamish, so if those scenes weren't in there this would be an A+, but they were, so as you can see, I gave this an A-. But considering how much everyone raved about this, I'm glad I didn't end up thinking this was overrated.Grade: A-, 9/10 4/5 stars"
" Amazing and inspiring. Great storey and well acted by all involved
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,8,Thoroughly entertaining! Damon brings a very likable character to the screen that the audience will root for. The Mars sequences are visually stunning.
" Hi, I'm Mark Watney and I am still alive.... Obviously
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,9,"The Martian is a space science fiction movie directed by Ridley Scott and stars Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wilg, Chiwetel Ejiofer, Sean Bean, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, Aksel Hennie, Benedict Wong and Donald Glover.The movie is about an astronaut who left behind on planet mars presuming dead utilise his wits and intelligence to survive with a very limited supply.The movie should be termed as one of the greatest space movie with beautiful depiction of the planet mars with the storms and weather.Credit should be given to screenplay writer and director to keep the scenes complex yet simple so that any layman can also understand what's going in the movie. Special mention of the depiction of space very accurately.Acting is good by all the characters and Matt Damon is been terrific of all. Background music is good. Climax is one of the best climax.The movie might have some flaws which is not required to be mentioned as director and screenwriter deserves this much liberty as it's a commercial movie and not documentary.One of the finest space movie and a must watch for all the space movie lovers."
" Really darn cool
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,8,"This, is a cool movie. Matt Damon kills it. Always interesting."
" A fun and thrilling movie that perfectly shows the ideal engineering mindset.( UK B+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,9,"The best part of the movie is that it starts out on Mars. It doesn't fully-dally around on earth to start the movie like Interstellar did(which I also love). The film is hilarious, scientifically accurate(mostly), intense, thrilling. This movie had it all. What a pleasant surprise."
" Extremely creative.
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,9,"This film is great. Full of clever ideas and very clever writing. All star cast, amazing special effects (Ridley Scott's bread and butter), a stellar score, and a story they had me on the edge of my couch for the whole film. A lot of good one liners. My only gripes were that some of the comedy didn't land for me, and I would have liked to see a more emotional ending for select characters."
" The movie should be counted as a comedy (or dramedy) or it isn't very good.
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,10,"I love this film. I love its optimism. I love its romantic view of how science-untouched and uninterested in politics!-works. I love that the film thinks people would be interested in space travel. I love the film's technical aspects creating a believable series of engineering feats that even look good to the eye. But I love the film as a light piece of scientific romance. It is not an intense exploration of the issues. It is not a drama.The film sort of infamously won the best picture-comedy at the Golden Globes. I saw it after that happened and I was really surprised anyone had the problem with the classification. The film is extremely funny. It has running gags. It has puns. It has multiply asides that are only in the film because they are funny. Most of the actors have comedic backgrounds. But most of all the central plot largely exists to hang wonderment and scientific romance on.Watney's death was only ever theoretical in the film. It was never a real possibility. The film repeatedly undermines the central tension with jokes. I think the film does this to focus the viewer on the engineering/science issues. The plot is faintly a little absurd in how the developments happen. Watney experiences all manners of set backs but, critically, they never ever seem more than he can handle; they are solved in fun ways. There's even a duck tape joke. This is a wonderful structure for a movie having fun with the engineering and the speculation of how a mars mission would work. Even in the film's darkest moments are tempered with optimism. Even as Watney fears his death and he is still at peace with it because he loves what he does. This tone works and the film is lovely as a result. But if you say the film is a drama it is too detached from Watney's possible death to work. The tension is never on if Watney will survive. It is on *how* Watney will survive and that makes it a scientific romance, not a drama.Damon is wonderful in this film. Indeed this is such a well put together and everything works so well that it is a personal favorite of mine."
" The Middling
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,4,"Charismatic leading actors can elevate films of they are well cast and 'The Martian' illustrates this point better than most. Matt Damon has enough screen presence to carry this mess off and carry the audience along with him.A large and illustrious production team also maintain acceptably high production standards and fairly imaginative production design work.....although at no single point did I think that anything looked like it couldn't have easily been filmed on Earth in a studio on a sound stage or semi dessert location. There wasn't a single moment of remarkableness in the visual design of the film.The artistic designs of the space vehicles and space travel seemed particularly unremarkable compared to other contemporary space sci-fi films.The script was miserably distracted from the fairly routine ""Lone survivor"" narrative structure of 'carrying on surviving at any cost' main plot by silly space stories about loads of mundane things: such as extremely likely threats and risks to possible near-future spacefarers; and scientific/engineering challenges, being treated utterly incredibly and implausibily.I did not find this ratio of straight and silly to be a harmonious tonal balance.Thank heavens for Matt Damon. The stand out feature of this feature film. All the other actors could have been ""anyones"", their characters certainly were.Ridley Scott made excellent films, sadly, he now seems to make indulgent films referential only to his own preoccupations. How will his 21st century ouvre be compared to his 20th? My answer is frankly: ""unfavourably"".I rate a 4/10 for a film that greatly disappointed me, but I'd recommend this firmly to Matt Damon fans and indeed, with rather more qualification, to anyone appreciative of star power/screen presence/ leading actors"
" Snoozefest
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,5,"Maybe one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen, the plot is so pedestrian and drudges along at an incredibly slow, and predictable, pace.If there's one thing in a movie that can make me lose interest faster than anything else, it is when an uncreative lead casting choice is made, and that actor casted simply plays themselves. It is the most cliched and boring type of movie when this happens, like a paint-by-numbers film experience, and Matt Damon is full blown Matt Damon in this. As a whole, and considering the ridiculous length of the movie, he shows no emotional range at all. It's like watching a Saturday Night Live skit where Matt Damon is just hanging out on a fake space rock, being himself.There are corny, banal, and cliched attempts at humor to really try to make it a commercial hit, but this is stuff that used to be original back in 1990; by now, you've seen and heard it all hundreds if not thousands of times.The only reason I'm even writing this review is because this movie has an 8.0 rating on here, which should mean it is special or elite, and my cable service provider gave it 4/4 stars. Frankly, I would be more entertained watching paint dry than to sit though this boring, predictable, slog of a movie that feels like it was only made for grade-schoolers.5/10 (all five for technical and visual effects)"
" Worst Space Movie Ever ...
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,1,"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, entirely not grounded in any scientific way!!!! Almost every problem in this movie was fixed with DUCT TAPE!! His helmet when it got cracked, and the station on Mars when it got depressurized (he fixed it with some plastic bags and DUCT TAPE!!). This is unbelievable, the pressure on the surface on mars is 1 % that on earth (same inside the station), this pressure difference should rip the plastic bag apart!!!! Also the martian dust is known to be toxic for humans, you can just bring it inside the station and mix it with grow potatoes!! And I don't wanna even start talking about his maneauver to escape mars and rendevouz with the rest of his team in orbit, and how he punctured his suit .. etc because it was complete stupidity!! It's almost like whoever wrote this movie didn't consider the slightest scientific facts about space travel, and dumbed down to like children's level!!"
" Intense

" Great
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,8,"Of course, the movie doesn't compete to the book, but it is still very great. Like many other space movie in the decade. It quite well-written, but I have to admit that it is way more based on the visual aspect. The movie is stunning, all the scene are well executed, but it is also able to be touching when needed. I have nothing more too add about this movie, I think that it should be watched."
" Entertaining enough
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,6,"Entertaining enough. I'm not really into sci-fi but this movie was pretty good. Good editing, direction and above average writing."

" My opinion
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie because it's scifi and i love scifi. And the actors were also rally good, especially Matt Damon as Mark Watney and Jessica Chastain as Melissa Lewis. My favorite charakter is Mark because he is clever."
" Balancing out good reviews
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,4,"Starts ok. Gets weaker and weaker.1. Every problem or life threatening situation is solved immediately so it never feels this guy is in peril.2. Ridiculous nonsensical physics throughout.3. Main character is a botanist and yet everyone is bewildered he can grow crops. Isn't that what he was presumably up there for?4. All supporting characters are generic and bland.5. The original crew decide within 30 seconds to turn around and go back to Mars. Good Lord. They basically act like spending another 2 years in space and risking their lives on a statistically improbable mission is a no brainer. This would be a ridiculously hard decision that would involve an intense debate.6. The Chinese officially offering their assistance took place over one silly phone call.7. Matt Damon flying through space via a hole in his suit.8. Matt Damon seems nearly completely unphased that he has been left stranded and unlike in Castaway, there is no suggestion that his mental health is in any way affected by such a difficult situation.On and on I could go."
" the Martian ***SPOILER***
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,10,"Ridley Scott's film ""The Martian"" is a movie about a group of astronauts who go to Mars on a mission. Everything is going well until a storm hits, everyone gets out safe except for Mark Watney played by actor Matt Damon. Mark is struck by an object flying through the air during a catastrophic storm. The crew decides to leave Mark behind as they believe he has died. Turns out... He's alive. The rest of the movie is about Marks journey alone in mars and learning how to fight many obstacles in his attempt to get back home.
Ridley Scott and the screenwriter Drew Goddard do a very good job of answering your questions throughout the film. For example, there are many times in the film where us as viewers may be confused because of physics or some other common fact. Like, what if he runs out of food, or what if he runs out of normal air. They answer those questions. Throughout the rest of the movie Matt Damon plays his part as mark exceptionally well. His part is to play a lonely Botanist on a deserted planet, with many movies such as... Star Wars you can tell they aren't actually on some sort of odd planet, but with the Martian you almost forget that he isn't on Mars he's actually in Wadi Rum, Jordan. Mark keeps you intrigued, because when he does come across an obstacle he's is very comedic about it. He not only shows how intelligent he is by conquering a nearly impossible task, but he does it in a humorous way which gives us a sense of reality.
Many will say that the Martian is predictable, I agree with them. Instead of choosing to fight predictability, the film The Martian chooses to let it happen and lean into it. The Martian does seem like a very scripted movie when it comes to knowing what is coming next, but I don't believe that it takes away from the heart touching plotline of it. Much like the new film Ford VS Ferrari that Matt damon also plays a lead role in. In the movie we can see what is about to happen. When he is told to cross the finish line with the rest of the Ford cars it was very predictable and obvious that one singular person was going to win. Matt Damon gives off the vibe and aroma that ""everything will be ok"". In Many of the films that Matt stars in we know that everything tends to work out in his favor just because we want it to.
During all of this crazy nonsense up in Mars, Back on earth NASA is trying to beat the clock and get Mark food and supplies in time. They also just decided to tell the team that Mark is in fact still alive. NASA proposed 2 ideas, Wait for the next mission to send supplies, or the team goes back for him. In a heartbeat every team member decided to lengthen their trip greatly and go back for their friend. Mark was given the exciting news and nearly broke down. He then started his plan for take off. Although he was getting saved it was a very complicated rescue mission. Mark was supposed to launch himself in space and then connect to the large spaceship that the crew was on. Everything seemed to be in order until Physics isn't lining up, the velocity was way too high and the distance from Mark to the crew was way too large. Mark came up with the idea while flying through space that he should leave his aircraft and proppell himself by cutting a hole in his air filled suit to navigate himself. Everyone thought this was stupid, but mark did it anyways without thinking twice. In a very nerve wracking travel through space ****Mark returned home safely.*****
Overall I think the Martian is a very well produced, heartwarming film about an astronaut Mark Watney who is stranded on Mars. Although the movie is very predictable I don't believe it takes away from the film in any sort of impacting way. I will definitely continue to watch this movie ritually as i believe it is one of the greatest films."
" Overrated
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,4,Maybe I had to high expectations but this is just another search and rescue movie that follows every single rule with the Hollywood ending.
" The Martian (it's not rocket science; until it's exactly that)
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Despite the isolation of the protagonist from the rest of the characters, action that is stretched out far too long, and the lack of more atmospheric shots, ""The Martian's"" witty script keeps the audience's interest alive in every scene. Space may be dangerous and intimidating, but the joy of scientific discovery and when things just work is addictive.When a freak sandstorm injures him and forces his crew to evacuate, protagonist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) must use his resourcefulness and his persistence to his advantage and work on a way to get back home. The wittiness of this movie is brought about by Watney himself, and occasional remarks from Teddy Sanders (Jeff Daniels) and Vincent Kapoor (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who are back on earth. With the many remarks and jokes he makes throughout the film, despite the possibility that he will die alone on Mars, he keeps the audience entertained and willing to watch more. The soundtrack is also a definite plus, with ABBA's ""Waterloo"" and Donna Summer's ""Hot Stuff"" giving the tone a slight facelift after some poor delivery of lines.And back on earth, with the crew at NASA leading the charge, the world is setting their sights on helping Watney succeed and bringing him home alive.As there's nobody there to talk to (because he's alone on an entire planet), Watney adapts to the way of constantly talking to himself or to multiple cameras that are constantly filming around the small space station. This eliminates what could have been lacking from the entire film by leaving the protagonist alone by himself for a long period of time without communicating with any other characters. By constantly glancing up at the central camera that was filmed with, Damon gives the audience the feeling that he's talking specifically to them and it gives this film a personal touch that's impossible to pass up.Of course, not all movies are perfect. And there are definitely examples of flaws in this movie. One of them, the most noticeable and most detrimental to the movie as a whole, is how the action is played out. It's very dragged out and seems like it takes 15 minutes to get through a 5 minute scene of action. But I bet that Matt had a ton of fun flipping around for hours on end. Another flaw that's noticeable in this movie is the lack of shots in actual space. Compared to the classic space movie, like the movie ""Gravity"" and even movies like ""Apollo 13"", this movie barely has any shots of space; and the only ones are near the end of it. Most of the shots take place on a planet, whether it be Mars or Earth. This doesn't necessarily take anything away from the film as a whole. But, for a space movie, I would have loved to see more shots of space or at least something more atmospheric that would add something to the feel of this film. The formula of switching back and forth between three types of setting makes the film a little stale and slightly predictable. Every time I saw the scene on Earth wrapping up, I would always think: ""I wonder what Mark's doing back on Mars? Farming some potatoes? Oh, ok.""Overall, I really liked this movie and would encourage you to go watch it."
" Deep space exploaration
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,9,"This sci-fi flick gives us a real look at what could very well be the state of space exploration in the near future, while also giving the audience something to think about. What is mankind? Who are we and what is our purpose in this vast universe? What would one man do if he found himself trapped, alone at the farthest reaches of space (farther than any human has traveled)? Would he give up and die? Or would he go to great lengths to survive?Astronaut Mark Watney becomes stranded on Mars after a space exploration mission that he's a part of goes horribly wrong. He must do whatever it takes to get back home to Earth. The story is presented in a very realistic and insightful manner. I give 9 out of 10 stars."
" Great book turned into a great movie

" Not a science fiction connoisseur but good

" Pretty boring
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,5,"Probably the most overrated movie of 2015. If you want to watch a similar movie about a person stuck in space go watch 'Moon' from 2009. The visuals are as good and the story is 10 times better, even acting. I'm not saying Ridley Scott is a bad director and Matt Damon a bad actor, the story here is just not that interesting, that's all."
" Yes I way over rated this film because of the re-watchable value
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,10,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I just like the whole story. Its a great story of human triumph and using your mind instead of super powers or muscles. Yes its not scientifically correct and their are holes in the story. Still I watch this movie at least once a month. Its not only a feel good movie but you dont have to feel stupid for liking it. I admit Im a big Damon fan after the Bourne films but he showed he could do these type of films also.
Maybe I will get tired of this after some years but to me this a very under rated film that should have been up their with other feel good films about mans triumph over their surroundings I know that isnt green now days but thats how we as humans have gotten to this point"
" Absurd premise- flase science
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,1,"So an astronaut is accidently left on Mars- and the gov't thinks they should spend ""an awful lot of money""- to run a program to get him back. with how many personnel (100, more ) hardware, working overtime for how many months. cost of a rocket. I can't even imagine the costs- a Trillion$
In a ""military operation"" loses =how many men and collateral damage. so our government spends all this to recover one man, rather than pretend he is really dead as 1st thought (public relations). it's silly that they accidently left him on Mars. How many other programs would have to be cut?
all that aside, the ridiculous fake science, incorrect basic facts- for Matt to make a biological system, create oxygen, grow food. till he can be rescued. and the loneliness and isolation doesn't affect him.
some other viewers have gone over specifics, so I won't.
Matt -and your people, don't you read scripts."
" Okay
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,6,"I lost interest in the movie after a while. It was fun in the beginning. The man in space learning to live for himself. Not expecting help. It had good reviews too. It just couldn't hold up for me. Not because of Damon, just because of the film.6 stars"
" Matt Damon - Space Pirate
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,10,"What a brilliant movie. It is one of those films you can watch on repeat over and over and still enjoy just as much each time.Matt Damon is in his element here. Combining good humour and some clever one liners with the sense of hopelessness and loneliness that comes with living on an entire planet on your own. His performance helps you believe you are there with him struggling in those harsh Martian conditions.I personally love Interstellar when it comes to my favourite space related sci-fi movie of all time. But if Interstellar is a 10/10 the Martian is a 9.999999999/10. Terri would not agree with this statement as it is tough to split the two.Decent book too if you have the time to read it. I'm hoping Andy Weir's other space themed novel ""Artemis"" gets the movie treatment too. Ridley Scott would do another amazing job directing that as he did with this one.Give this one a watch folks and watch it again!"
" It is very good
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,6,"I like it. I know I like it. I want to give it more than a 6. It deserves more than a 6. There is cool Martian landscaping. I like the lead performance. I like what happens. I like sci-fi. I believe it's worth more than the 6 I gave it. Honestly, I'll stick to my 6."
" Progressive garbage
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,1,"The film starts, and within a couple of minutes we are introduced to an astronaut crew where a woman is in command, ordering men around. I simply don't watch films that push the reversal of gender roles. I couldn't care less about the plot, the direction, or anything else. I stopped watching a few minutes into the film."
" The Martian - Scientific Accuracy is Lost in Space.
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,3,"Ridley Scott's late career nosedive into banal mediocrity continues unchecked. Thinking back on it, the last Ridley Scott film I actually enjoyed was Black Hawk Down, which is now seventeen years old. After being disappointed with Kingdom of Heaven (I thought a movie about the Crusades might feature some actual Crusading, wanton slaughter and pillaging, but there wasn't really very much at all, the Christians and Muslims all seem to be getting along fairly well in this one. I almost expected them to all hold hands and sing ""Give Peace a Chance"" at the end), along with American Gangster, Prometheus, and not to mention the absolutely awful Alien: Covenant, it appears that Ridley Scott is losing it in his old age. You can't blame him for it, I mean the dude's gotta be nearly eighty years old. You have to give him some respect for the fact that he is still a prolific director at his age, even if his 21st century films can't measure up to his classics. Methinks time may be nigh for him to step away from the camera.Henceforth let it be proclaimed that Sir Ridley of Scott shalt retire forthwith, and spare the kingdom of Hollywoodland and its subjects the tribulations and vexations thou doth suffer from the pestilential miasma of his heretical, blasphemous, and thrice damned Alien prequels, lest a plague afflicts his peasants with unsightly boils. (I knew I really shouldn't have watched the director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven).And so, on to The Martian. It seems like Matt Damon is now Hollywood's go to guy when it comes to portraying astronauts stranded on distant planets, but at least his character in this one is a bit more heroic than the cowardly Dr. Mann from Interstellar.Even though my expectations were quite low, I was still prepared to give The Martian a look. A realistic, near future science fiction film that was marketed as a scientifically accurate depiction of a manned mission to Mars, based on a best-selling novel. Surely Sir Ridley couldn't stuff this one up too badly could he? With a sinking feeling I realised that it sure seemed like it, when the incident that leaves Matt Damon's character stranded on Mars was based on total horse manure ""Hollywood Science.""I have three questions regarding the ""Scientific Accuracy"" of The Martian.
Who was the scientific adviser? What were they smoking when they read the script? Where can I get some?I am not an astrophysicist, I flunked physics in High School, yet even I could have done a better job advising the film-makers on scientific accuracy than the so-called ""Scientific Adviser"" they used. I wonder what this individual actually did to earn their paycheck? Nothing at all as far as I can tell. Here's the thing: Due to the low atmospheric pressure on Mars, the most powerful dust storm possible would be comparable to nothing more than a light breeze on Earth. It would barely have the power to mess up your hair, let alone topple the ascent vehicle or blow heavy equipment around like projectiles. The only danger such a storm would pose would be due to low visibility, you could potentially trip over and tear your suit, smash your visor, or fall into a deep crater. It really wouldn't have been too difficult for the author to devise a scientifically accurate reason for Watney's stranding on Mars, it's just lazy writing and a lack of research.Suspension of Disbelief rogered senseless and thrown right out the window. There are many more plot-holes and scientific inaccuracies in The Martian, which I won't bother to list. They sure as hell didn't ""Science the "" out of the screenplay, that's for sure. Although to be fair I haven't read the novel, and I don't know if the reason for the astronaut's stranding was the same as the film, so it might not be Ridley Scott's fault, but then again why bother hiring a scientific adviser?Why would a botanist even be included on a mission to Mars? There sure ain't no plant life to study, and considering they have found Martian meteorites that contain fossilised bacteria a micro-biologist would make more sense.Oh well, at least Ridley Scott knows how to ramp up the tension and suspense I thought, and the tale of Watney's efforts to survive would at least be satisfying on that level, but it seems Scott has forgotten how to achieve this (maybe he should go back and watch Alien again to remind himself), as there was no suspense generated at all, and I found the whole thing pretty underwhelming and rather boring. And to top it all off the ending blatantly rips off Red Planet. What is it with movies about Mars? Mission to Mars, Red Planet, John Carter of Mars, all very bad films. One day someone will make a good science fiction film about Mars, but The Martian sure as hell ain't it. I must admit though that The Martian looked great, the production design and cinematography were good, and the cast weren't bad so it gets three out of ten. A Ridley Scott film is always going to be visually impressive that's a given, but his choice of mediocre scripts and screenwriters ensures that his modern films are very underwhelming dramatically and thematically"
" One word ""Brilliance"".
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,10,"Acting,direction,detailing everything is ""Brilliant"". There are reviews asking . Why Matt was not crying on being stranded on Mars. Appears as if people like watching 2 hrs of crying rather than watching a man with positivity."
" One of the 2010s smartest movies, Ridley Scott hasn't lost his spark
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,8,"Scott knocks it out of the park with a film adaptation of the 2011 novel of the same name written by Andy Weir. The film follows the struggle of Mark Wattney left for dead on the surface of Mars after a severe dust storm causes his research team to make an emergency evacuation after the storm lays waste to their research facility. Wattney survives, but now with no connection to Earth, he must rebuild on his own for his own survival and find a way to connect back to home.Matt Damon plays a very excellent character of Mark Wattney who is surprisingly optimistic and full of charm and humor even though he is aware of the fact that all the odds are against him when it comes to his survival, but through his own wits and scientific knowledge, he will overcome the spectacular odds through the power of science and botanyMatt Damon constantly drops line after line of charisma, witty dialoge and an infectiously likeable personality that you will root for him throughout the entire run time of the movie as he solves problem after problem, always maintaining his humor and optimism throughoutThe special effects in this movie are a sight to behold aswell with some incredible outdoor scenes of Mars which is replicated beautifully with some outstanding CGI. It really captures the emptiness of the planet which further adds to his pure isolation.It's a more than great adaptation of the novel and is full of scientific brilliance aswell as a great performance from Matt Damon aswell as Jeff Daniels, Jessica Chastain and Chiwetel Ejiofor. It's a great sci-fi experience. It will not dissapoint"
" great sci-fi, with the accent on science
",2019-12-04 00:00:00,10,"Right up there with ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar."" Best science fiction in forever, with accent on SCIENCE.I won't go on about the virtues of this movie, although I could. Others have done that. I simply want to point out one factor that has not received enough attention.There is a divide in the USA right now between people who believe in science and research, and those who prefer to listen to their ""gut."" We currently have flat-earthers, anti-vaxxers, and (as always) people who don't believe that cell phone driving, drunk driving, or cigarette smoking will ever kill them, despite statistics.On the other side, we have people who believe in the scientific method, research, and empirical evidence.No one could watch this movie and fail to see the virtues of following the paths of Copernicus, Galileo, Curie, Salk, Einstein, Degrass-Tyson, and so many others.So choose your side, people. You can't have it both ways. ""The Martian"" is a powerful argument for science and progress."
" Science fiction blockbuster
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,6,"Fun movie with bad science. Even the premise is bad. Read about Mars dust storms if you would like to know but don't get me wrong, I love the science fiction genre for both entertainment and implication. I don't even mind bad science if there is decent character development example, Ad Astra, Gravity, etc. With that being said, the martian is a film that leans toward entertainment and carries an overall optimistic tone despite events that would likely bear great emotional, psychological affects on any realistic main character. I believe it to be a blockbuster geared to make money. I do think Matt Damon is a decent actor but I could think of better actors to portray a stranded astronaut but hey, excellent acting was not the films intended purpose. There is little character development. The film is fun to look at but it's a generic rescue story that little to chew on intellectually afterward."
" The Martian
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,9,"I absolutely love space. Between the unknown, the grand scale, and the unlimited possibilities; space is something I find fascinating. As a kid there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to become an astronaut when I grew up. As I got older I knew that it wouldn't be a possibility. It's no surprise that space films are my favorite types of films. Science Fiction is my favorite genre and when the sci-fi movie takes place in space, oh man I'm like a kid in a candy store while watching a science fiction space film. 2001: A Space Odyssey, Solaris, Gravity, Alien, Aliens, Moon, and Interstellar are all films that I consider to be some of my all-time favorites. After seeing The Martian its not too far off from those other films. This is great, but not quite on the same level as the space films I mentioned above.As of late, Ridley Scott hasn't exactly been top notch. I did like Prometheus, but many did not. I hated The Counselor and Exodus: Gods and Kings was incredibly boring. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little worried about The Martian despite its fantastic cast and great subject material (I read the book).The Martian has restored my faith in Ridley Scott's ability as a director. In all honestly, I think Ridley deserves an Oscar Nomination for best director. The direction in this movie is nothing short of outstanding. This movie looks absolutely fantastic. Mars looked incredible. Space looked incredible. Everything looked incredible! From a technical standpoint, this is phenomenal.Like Ridley Scott, Matt Damon gives his best work in years. A great comeback film for both of these guys. All the performances are great. I was most surprised by Kristen Wiig. I don't think I've ever seen her in a non-comedy role and to my surprise she ended up being pretty great here.My one problem with the movie is that it drags on in some parts. Also, the book is better. Which isn't a knock or an issue I had with the movie. I'm just saying that I preferred the book over the movie."
" Very good show
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,10,Very entertaining and inspiring. My family really enjoyed watching it.
" Captivating!
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,9,"I ended up enjoying this movie, A LOT.The set design & visuals were absolutely amazing, and truly stood out the most to me personally. The attention to detail and overall complexity of the whole ""stuck-on-a-planet-completely-alone"" concept is super captivating and there isn't a single lull in the entire 2+ hours of the film.Biggest flaw and only reason i'm not giving 10/10 is the lack of character development. I find that there are very lack luster reactions (or no reactions at all) from certain characters in moments that have been greatly built up. Err, to name a few...1) Mark Wattney's family? Nope.
2) The crew finding out Wattney was ALIVE. No kiddin' right?
3) Wattney & CDR Lewis speaking again before launch. Um, the fact that this is the first time Wattney has heard another humans voice in literally FOREVER.
4) The crew reuniting with Wattney - overall could have been way bigger and was cut too short.Either way, the film was still outstanding. To be fair I could see how some of those missing aspects would have potentially made the movie too lengthy.Also was really cool to see Donald Glover in this! Would absolutely recommend."
" Beautifully shot and intense movie
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,8,"This movie explores the mental and physical, stresses of dealing with survival in bleak conditions. Matt Damon does an excellent job showing the emotions and thoughts that come with such a situation. Don't pick it apart, just enjoy it. Supporting cast does a great job and you almost believe the story as it goes on. And really happy that this movie was shot in my country Jordan in Wadi Rum where you truly feel that you're on Mars.
The only downside of this movie was the the illogical scietific things that Damon did, like planting Potatoes in space without testing the PH of soil or even if it's possible to plant there, and using his feaces as fertiliser? really? wouldn't that be toxic?
Overall, it's really good movie to watch as it keeps you on the edge of your seat most of the times"
" It's sci-fi cinema done right - pleasantly surprised
",2019-11-07 00:00:00,8,"I don't argue for the movie's accuracy in terms of the challenges of space travelling. Although I have heard Neil DeGrasse Tyson claims this is one of the best movies he has seen on that front. But personally, as long as it looks / sounds fairly plausible on screen... it really does not affect the film's entertainment values. Nor does not having read the book it is based on.As for the film itself - I was a bit sceptical about The Martian because, despite being directed by Ridley Scott, I am not traditionally a big fan of sci-fi movies. But was pleasantly surprised by it.Given how much of the movie is focused on the survival of a man who is stranded on Mars (the remainder on the way to get him out of there), it was very entertaining to see him adapt, innovate, fight boredom... everything to survive. On his own. And those scenes were never long enough to bore me. Not sure if it's thanks to the script, the acting or the directing - but it delivers!I care less for the heroics involved in the attempt of saving the astronaut but the depiction of his own struggle back in Mars is spot-on. And keeps you rooting for him throughout.Overall solid enough to be an 8 or higher."
" I expected something more tense then this.
",2019-11-07 00:00:00,5,"Whats with this world? Something is really overated and something is underrated. Underated like Terminator Salvation,Event Horizon and similar sci-fi, but this , 8.0 i mean what!?
This movie had good start , but after he lost his crew and he was solo accidentally on this planet i expected he is going to loose insanity now and start having hallucinations. I mean u are relaxed alone in planet and u are all doing fine throughout entire years without loosing your mind... They better had this tense mind blow stuff throughout this movie and weird hallucinations because you getting crazy by being solo, then soft movie like this one. IDK i was really bored watching. I really like Matt Damon and his movies but this one nah. Even his movie Elysium i found better and underated then this one."

" Mars exploration
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,10,"This movie is really good, great acting by matt damon! Best sci-fi movie after Gravity!"
" Simple, unique, different and interesting.
",2019-10-29 00:00:00,10,Yes the story is not more than the survival on Mars but the whole story has it's own interesting side. This is really a good one for those who are found of science and astrology because many topics were really interesting from the scientific point of view. It is nothing like boring even after revolving around a single person.
" The interplanetary tech geek gardening thriller of the year.
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,9,"The Martian plays to both Scott's strengths and weaknesses. By relegating Mark's predicament to a purely survivalist scenario, he keeps things humming along without ever widening the horizon. But there was an obligation to widen the horizon."
" Why Not Keep Growing Potatoes?
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,7,"I watch this movie often for it's problem solving plot line. However, a few things are missing, like character development. We only see bits of the crew's reaction to Watney's death, and not even a glimpse of Watney's mom and dad, the could have at least been watching on TV with the rest of America, so the movie comes off a little staid. The inner ship Hermes views are really fun to see.Even in the problem solving, though I find issues. The major one is about the loss of the potato crop. Watney started out with whole potatoes and human waste as fertilizer. The crops and fertilizer were destroyed, but Watney still had potatoes, and tuh, he still had fertilizer in the supply from one human per day (at the least). Therefore he still had the means to build up a potato plant, even one per day until he had a new crop. Do the math, people. 1 potato + one human fertilizer per day x 365 days equals a lot of potatoes! But that wouldn't help a plot line. LOL."
" Please read the book and just forget about the movie.
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,1,"This is by far one of the most boring movies of all time thanks to the by-the-numbers screenplay and lazy direction. This Martian does nothing new or interesting; its characters all have traits that don't mean or contribute to anything; its has too much dialogue and the movie forgets about show-don't-tell and that's not even the most offensive thing about the movie. The most offensive thing about the movie is that its a complete injustice to its source material: ""The Martian"" the book is a book that is telling a genuinely interesting tale exemplified by the realistic, grounded science it is based in. This all important aspect of the book is completely lost on the the movie (and its makers). ""Science-ing the s*** out of this"" is only a cathc-phrase to them it instead of being the ever-important philosophy it should embody. Please just read the book and forget about the movie."
" Movie is good but corniness ruined it.
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,1,"I liked the movie, loved the effects, loved the team spirit and everything but constant corny dialogues ruined it for me, comedy seemed forced at times and took away all the greatness of the movie, yeah greatness, if the movie was more focused it could've been great, but it felt like the dialogues were written by a teenager."
" A Wonderful movie

" What can I say?
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,10,"This is my go-to movie when I'm feeling down.The soundtrack is awesome and Matt Damon is awesome. It's fascinating to see how he fights against the elements and himself to survive. It's like Cast Away, but in space and with a more light-hearted tone."

" Robinson Crusoe in interstellar era
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,7,"In this movie Matt Damon goes to be alone of new Robinson Crusoe: after an accident during a mission, he remains on Mars and their colleagues think he's dead. Instead, he has to try to live on Mars and to invent solutions to survive using what he finds. Fortunately he's a botanic scientist and manages to create crops and to eat potatoes.This interesting idea open to a reflection on techniques: human being is configured as the technological being, and it's work is creation of artificial stuff. The fact that Mars is inhospitable, makes this process a sort of foundation, a sort of creation of a new civilization that is born from human faith on technological world.This interesting reflection on relation between man, techniques and nature (but with a too clear positivism), however, is not developed with the deepening that I would love to see: beyond a lot of infodumps, there's a no-problematized condition of man in a terrible desert. He's activity is not quite put in dialogue with fear of death and desperation and the final is too easy. In conclusion, for me is a good movie, but if it was thought with a bigger consideration of risks and madness, it would has been better."
" Sort of a mix of Castaway and Gravity
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,9,"Super good, enjoyed this one a lot. Sort of a mix of Castaway and Gravity with Matt Damon taking on the deserted Hanks role, explaining things to a video diary along the way after he is left stranded on Mars and presumed dead by his crew. With meager supplies he must find a way to contact Earth, make oxygen and grow some food. Its very funny and Damon seems to be having a great time.It did feel a bit too long but in saying that I also can't think of any scenes that were unnecessary. Great special effects and finally a movie using CGI and green screens to enhance the movie not just BE the movie as is often the case these days, where movies forget about a story and just become special effect extravaganzas.It gets a bit over-the-top towards the end with Damon in his Ironman reminiscent suit but I went with it. Worth a watch.Oh, this is based on a book by Andy Weir and directed by Ridley Scott."
" Cast Away in space
",2019-09-18 00:00:00,8,I went to see this movie in theatre's on release day completely by accident I actually went to see a different movie but missed the start time so just picked this movie simply because there was a line for it and I thought must be good if people are lining up for it and by the final act of the movie I was on the edge of my seat heart pounding at how things were gunna turn out and I left the theatre in aww of this movie completely forgetting that I came to see a completely different movie.The story follows astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) who is accidently left behind on the planet Mars by his crew mates who think he died during an accident caused by a sandstorm that forced them to abort there mission and evacuate the planet but after they have left the planet and began there long journey back to earth Mark Wakes up in the aftermath the strom left behind barely alive he takes shelter in the temporary base used for the crews brief time on the planet now alone with little food water and supplies and no way to get home he begins working on a way to survive till the next scheduled Mars mission in four years time.The film is expertly shot by director Ridley Scott who is most well known for making the epic space horror movie Alien in 1979 the cast is perfect and Matt Damon gives one of his best performances to date.I recommend this movie to any Science Fiction fan and fans of intense thrillers and survival story's you will not be let down by this movies stunning cinematography suspence and story.
" Surprisingly good

" My Review!
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,8,"It takes a lot of theoretical knowledge to conceptualise a movie that's based on Mars and oh boy, they've nailed it (i think). The Combination of graphics, hard work and sheer acting experience of Matt Damon brought life to this beautiful movie, The Martian. If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly insist you do. Most of the physics stuff might be a bit over the head, but the simplicity of words used in scripting might just give you a fair picture of what is going on.P.S
If you're planning to watch this one on TV or computer, probably not a good idea!Peace Out!"
" Entertaining space-adventure flick.
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,8,"Lost on the red planet, an astronaut begins to look for ways to survive on the surface of Mars, while on Earth, everyone tries their best to bring him back.With fantastic special effects, beautiful shots like any Ridley movie, The Martian is a film that wonders the eyes with its incredible presentation, expressing itself through tense scenes, hilarious, entertaining, moving and fantastic, showing scenarios in high quality. An entertaining movie and able to put itself as a high quality space adventure film. The solid performances of the cast present us with a tangible story, especially Matt's acting ability that never fails to give us some scenes hard to forget.An entertaining movie that manages to consume his time quickly without us thinking about it, even though it is not totally a master touch. The movie doesn't have a lot of tense scenes, well, it does, but it seems to be more like a situation where we already know what will happen, so the tension is quickly removed. The structure of the film is also somewhat fast, moving completely, and features a large cast of actors who act wonderfully, but don't have as much time on screen as we would like. Still, The Martian is a wonderful space adventure movie worth watching."
" This had some real content
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,10,"I loved this. Not just because I like space movies, but that it had good acting, script, and execution. I watched it about 5 times and didn't get bored. I thought Chiwetel Eljofore was great in his role. Need more movies of this caliber."
" The death or resolution.
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,5,"The most important thing is the knowledge itself, but the wisedom for working it.
Watney starring by Matt Damon was left alone in Mars. That sounds serious, but actually it was not. It reminds me the old TV program. In that, a comedian lived alone only by the lottery. It was similar to this.A few days ago, I asked my coworker if she has watched it already. But her reply was so funny! She asked me, 'It's a story about the growing potetos, isn't it?' I was so surprised!! As she got it like that, actually it's a positive survival."
" ""How to cultivate potatoes""
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,6,"This film had potential, unfortunately not much happens and we are just subjected to an individuals mundane life on Mars.If you are interested in harvesting potatoes I'd recommend it, for anything else just have a snooze."
" One more reason not to give up on humankind
",2019-08-17 00:00:00,9,"I first saw The Martian in 2015 in a movie theater and I remember enjoying it.
After giving it a re-watch 4 years later I can say I enjoyed it even more.
The best part about this film for me is its emotional package. I love it when a film shares its emotions with you through good screenplay and acting. And The Martian does a great job at this.
The film also deliveres a very hopeful message. There is still good in humankind and as Sean Bean said it in the film - a single life is worth it.
It feels great to see people dealing with the situation through science one problem at a time (as Damon's character put it in the end of the film). Human intelligence and cooperation can work miracles, and as I've said, even one human life is worth all the trouble.
The characters were also great, them being more human (all the humour and interactions) but still logical and thoughtful helped the story.
It is also great that they have made it technical enough to be believable.
Some of the comedy timings and mentions made me burst into laughter (especially the Project Elrond announcement with Sean Bean in one scene).
And while I do think that making this a little darker would've made it better, I still think that The Martian is one of the best movies about human spirit, survival and problem solving.P.S. It was interesting to see how some of the ideas and vistas of The Martian made it into other Ridley Scott's projects like Alien Covenant."
" Awesome
",2019-08-12 00:00:00,10,I'll watch this movie over and over and over again! In fact I bought the regular blu ray and then bought the extended version witch was a treat to watch as well.
" Good movie

" Light hearted spacey fun, minus the aliens and a dash of drama
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,10,"The film The Martian was adapted from the novel of the same name by Andy Weir. This film is placed at some point in the near future where humans have successfully landed on Mars. We join the film midway through the third manned mission to Mars. The crew is going about their tasks, you are given the feeling that they are excited yet settled into a normal routine of daily tasks. What we see of these tasks is short-lived however because a storm is moving in and the crew must act fast to escape. In the following frantic minutes, the crew attempts to salvage their work before take-off, however, as they move through the storm one of the crew is struck by debris and is lost in the dust of the storm. Without the time to search and the astronaut's life signs failing to report the crew launches in their vehicle to head home.The theme throughout this movie is hope through cooperation, we begin to see this theme shortly after the crew escapes, as this is where the movie truly begins. We learn that our main character, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) did survive the storm, but now alone on Mars he must survive again with limited resources and knowing that it will be at least 4 years before help arrives. While we feel for the character initially being abandoned on a planet, it isn't long before NASA discovers that he is alive and work begins to save him.
This film overall is one of my favorites, I have watched it at least 5 times over the years and read the book multiple times as well. Matt Damon's portrayal of Mark Watney is a perfect fit, his mix of humor and emotion as he goes through his ordeal is captivating. All the actors/actresses in this film really were superb, it is one of those movies where you can tell that everything and everyone just clicked together to create something special.There was a large cast behind this film but some of the highlights were Jeff Daniels as NASA Director Teddy Sanders, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Vincent Kapoor Director of Mars Missions, and Kristin Wiig who I am generally not a fan of for all her comedy movies but was great as NASA's Media Relations Director Annie Montrose. We follow these characters as they initially deal with the loss of Mark Watney and then work to save him once he is determined to be alive. The set design and sound are amazing, while Mars appears clearer then what we generally see in photos from our rovers I completely by what I see and hear. The technology in the movie seems futuristic yet attainable, nothing appears to be so advanced as to be not a reality within the next 20 years.
The music choice while not a personal favorite fits well into the movie and is used in multiple ways, as a running joke about bad taste in music, as a source of positivity and laughter to see Mark Watney listen and comment on the songs despite his situation, and as a source of hopefulness as we see people of different ethnicities, countries, and political influences put their difference aside to work toward the goal of saving one human. I will admit that I am a sucker for that last bit, this part of the movie and the beginning of Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets both have scenes of selfless cooperation that really touches me.If you are a fan of space movies minus the aliens and love disco music then this movie is for you, if you love Matt Damon then this movie is for you if you love underdog movies where people work together to overcome then this movie is for you."
" One of the best

" I loved everything about this movie
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,10,"I loved the main character. I love how he makes the best time while being all alone and without knowing what's about to happen. It seemed to bother most of the people that there was not much communication, I personally find this odd. Ofcourse, if you're a ""nerd"" you would see some things that don't match up compared to the reality that science thought us to believe. You need to remember you're still allowed to dream. Totally recommend this movie if you want to lose track of time! Give it a chance."

" Best movie Ever

" Fun sci-fi thing
",2019-07-10 00:00:00,6,"This is a pretty good movie. Everything looks great, and Matt Damon gives a good performance. The parts where he tried to grow food, and when they were planning the rescue, were quite interesting. The climax was a little lackluster, as all their crazy plans end up working just as expected. I didn't find it very tense, and it lacked any of the social commentary that great sci-fi films usually have. Entertaining and well executed, but not particularly deep or ground-breaking."
" Very Interesting and Entertaining
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,8,"I love this movie and have watched it several times. The whole case is terrific and the science is better than most, as several scientists have pointed out.
True there are some conceits here, but a movie without conceits is either a documentary or very boring or perhaps both.
The design of the spaceships and the other hardware was first rate; I don't know that there was hardware we saw that couldn't actually exist in the near future.Mark's emotional progression was very well done. There would definitely be some very high highs and some very low lows during that ordeal!I did end up hating the NASA director (Jeff Daniels) because he seemed to embody the worst of the recent NASA managers with his decision making.
If I had been Mitch Henderson, my response to being asked to resign by the NASA director would have been to say 'I'll put my resignation on top of yours'. Not sure if future space travel will include a NASA manager in charge. Might be more realistic to have a corporate person in that position.I do wonder about the reviewers who tried to point out inconsistencies. One being that Mark could have just replanted everything after the storm destroys his crops.
I think this statement completely ignores the fact that when Mark established his 'farm' he was working off the food supply left from the original mission with only some slight rationing. His energy levels would have been at their highest. Existing off mostly potatoes by the time the HAB was compromised he would not have had the energy or the will to re-establish the farm. With a supreme effort he was able to get to the Aries IV MAV. There he got better food (you can see he is having an actual meal) before he had to strip down the MAV for his launch.
So there were certainly some conceits made as this was a movie, but his inability to restart his farm was not one of them.
I think it was certainly a satisfying movie and will undoubtedly watch it again."
" my notes

" Fun for Almost Everyone!
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,8,"This is a very solid sci fi film; one that certainly stands out above the crowd as a more memorable entry into the genre. Spellbinding visual effects, wonderful performances, and a hilarious and fast-paced script make for a very enjoyable and epic journey over the surface of Mars. I absolutely recommend this movie; it's one that I think almost everyone will enjoy."
" Entertaining, but some things are annoyingly unrealistic
",2019-06-08 00:00:00,7,"This is a gripping, entertaining movie, light, not overly dramatic and funny. It doesn't pretend to be scientific, but you cannot just talk to someone on The Earth the way you'd do it on regular video conference, - Mars is too far for that ! It takes light 3 min to cover the distance from Mars to Earth. It could have been much better movie if they'd done it the right way."
" Do rewatch this
",2019-06-02 00:00:00,10,This movie was a hit in 2015 but many seem to have forgotten about it. This movie should definitely not be forgotten about. It is Matt Damon's best movie in my opinion. The humor brought to us through the writing is hilarious and it is delivered perfectly by people like Matt and Donald Glover. The concept is both sciencey and interesting to your average watcher. It is a compelling story filled with trials to overcome. With an amazing soundtrack this really is a 10/10.
" Couldn't Decide if I Wanted Damon to Survive
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,6,"The first half of this movie is not bad, although the happy go lucky, put a happy face on being left on Mars (Damon) was 60% hard to take. Permanently robbed of any credibility by his starring role in Dumb and Dumber, Jeff Daniels was not believable as the head of NASA.Hearkening back to Apollo 13, the ingenuity factor was interesting. The second half became predictable and silly. There should have been a lot more left on the cutting room floor. It's loooong."

",2019-05-10 00:00:00,10,"Ridley Scott is without a doubt one of the finest film directors of the last 45 years and in that time he directed great movies such as ""Gladiator"" (2000), ""Alien"" (1979), ""American Gangster"" (2007), and ""Black Hawk Down"" (2001), and with ""The Martian"" he has not only added another great film to that elite resume he has also directed one of the finest science fiction movies of the decade. The movie is based on Andy Weir's novel of the same name (which I did not read prior to seeing this movie) and stars Matt Damon in one of the finest performances of his career as Mark Watney who is on a mission to Mars with Captain Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) who is in charge of the mission, Major Rick Martinez (Michael Peña) the mission's pilot, Beth Johanssen (Kate Mara) the mission's systems operator, and Chris Beck (Sebastian Stan) who is a surgeon on the mission. At first everything seems fine on Mars but goes horribly wrong in an instant when a dust storm forces the crew to evacuate and in the process leaves Watney behind after not being able to find him. After Watney finds himself left on Mars he has to resort to his wits in order to survive on Mars for as long as he possibly can until help arrives while also try to figure out a way to tell NASA that he is still alive and well. The movie is not only one of the best sci-fi adventures this decade has to offer but it ranks with ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) and ""Apollo 13"" (1995) as one of the greatest movies about space exploration ever put on film. The movie features excellent performances throughout especially from an excellent supporting cast which includes Jeff Daniels as the president of NASA, Chiwetel Ejiofor who plays the man in charge of all of the missions to the red planet, and Sean Bean who plays the flight director for NASA. Scott's direction is on point and Drew Goddard's screenplay places tension at all the right moments to the point where you are actually there with them in this uncomfortable situation. This a very entertaining movie that has some very pulse pounding moments that is sure to be remembered for years to come, and put simply is a must see film."
" Realistic account of trying to survive on Mars while awaiting rescue
",2019-05-07 00:00:00,8,"In 2035 an astronaut (Matt Damon) gets stuck on Mars after he is presumed dead and his team departs without him. When NASA eventually finds out that he's alive & well they have to find a way to save him. But can he survive for the next couple of years until they arrive? Jeff Daniels plays the director of NASA while Jessica Chastain plays the leader of the vessel. Sean Bean, Chiwetel Ejiofor and several other notables are on hand.The only way for Ridley Scott's ""The Martian"" (2015) to work is if it can convince you that Damon's character is actually on Mars, which it does spectacularly and realistically (minus a few forced dramatics or stabs at humor here and there). If, like me, you're fascinated by Mars or the potential of living on another planet in the real world, ""The Martian"" is a must.It's reminiscent of movies like ""Armegeddon"" (1998), ""Mission to Mars"" (2000), ""Gravity"" (2013) and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968), albeit without the fantastical elements of some of these. It even brings to mind the first acts of ""Planet of the Apes"" (1968) and ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (1970).The movie scores pretty well on the female front with Chastain, Mackenzie Davis, Kate Mara and Kristen Wiig. Davis looks good in tight pants.The film runs 2 hours, 24 minutes.GRADE: A-/B+"
" Good Fun
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,8,"THE MARTIAN is a realistic science-fiction film set in the near future. It stars Matt Damon in one of his finer performances. I normal don't care for his acting, but I thought he did a pretty good job in this one.The directing and cinematography are great. The pacing is spot-on. I think this is one of Ridley Scott's better films. Highly recommend."
" Bring Him Home
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,8,"It's possible to nitpick and complain about the structure of The Martian, but at the end of it all, I can't help but say I was inspired by it and that's what matters the most. Like Interstellar before it, deep down The Martian is all about telling the kids growing up now that, yes, you can dream about going to Mars. When we work together, or even when we're alone and determined - ""where there's a will there's a way"" - and we can accomplish anything, even the impossible. If everybody says it won't work, screw them, just go out and do it. I love that Ridley Scott is having fun with the sci-fi genre again. Go see The Martian and be inspired again."
" Why go back in the first place?
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,7,"Our hero is stranded on Mars by a sandstorm and his crew members leaving. This premise didn't bother me at all (although scientifically inaccurate). I just accepted it and went along with it.The visuals were great. I think they did a great job in creating a plausible Mars base. This is the best element of the movie!I'm also glad we didn't get a soppy family story from our hero himself! In the likes of: ""I need to get back, for my son"". I wondered though:
Why go back in the first place?Billions of dollars have gone into getting the crew THERE!
Psychology, they have accepted their likelihood of dying.Realistically, even dying on Mars should be a personal honor. If astronauts are going to Mars it'll be a one-way trip right?Scientifically, why use all these resources to go back - and save one measly human (no offence). We should accept that. Probably the first missions will be about building as much as possible. Can we create a self-sustaining Mars?Other scientific things that did annoy me:
The ungodly amount of duct tape.The lack of communicationThe bombsEither way, despite this, the film is entertaining, visually stunning and filled with great actors. It is an okay movie experience.If you expect a cliché Hollywood movie and get a cliché Hollywood movie - you'll be content."
" 11/10 unironically and wholeheartedly
",2019-04-09 00:00:00,10,"I could not name a single thing that could be improved in this movie without sacrificing some of its realism and unique feeling.It is not typical hollywood, the ""countdown stops at 0:01"" feeling is missing from the movie. Which is apparently what a lot of people miss, because scifi is aliens and lasers and action.
But this is how things actually usually are and it gives the actions of the characters and challenges faced by them paradoxically *more* weight through this.
This is an extremely brave decision that on its own sets this movie into a class of its own.It is deceptivey light. It is a positive, realistic, and respectful portrayal of the future, instead of a romp through some adventure, while at the same time being relevant in the present and ebracing the past.It manages to appeal to the human desire for exploration and togetherness without being emotionally manipulative. Kindof how a planet loved and cheered for the mars exploration rovers as if they were actual beings of their own. Because the capacity and desire of humans for connection and discovery is limitless. This movie speaks perfectly to that part in all of us.It is also a veritable nerd's delight without ever being embarrassing and feeling ""wink wink, nudge nudge""-y.The acting was so on point that it retroactively erased all of Matt Damons other roles from memory, and all future performances will be measured to this one.The characters were real. Not action/sci fi heroes, but regular nerds and people.This movie also adds something to the real world by it existing. It portrays exploration realistically, but still in a positive light, appealing to the human craving for it, and maybe reawakening that. At the same time it teaches that difficulties are not overcome as al movies would have you believe, by just a couple of people trying really hard for a couple of hours and fighting it out possibly. Difficulties are overcome by enduring through difficult times, taking advice from other people, and keeping hope. Physical fortitude, book smarts, coolness and on your feet thinking, friends you can rely on, emotional strength, and burning passion, desire and trying hard are all things that work together to get one through the night. Alone they are not enough, but some can be missing from people at times.
But we as humans overcome the difficulties. Because in the end it is worth it. For the future of us individually and all of us collectively.No other movie does as good a job as this one of conveying this.
All while i fail to find anything that when changed could make this movie better.
And while it is appealing in all its details, characters, designs, references, robots, music and action.Truly in a class of its own, and compared to others definitely up at the top with the best of them."
" Insanely entertaining
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,10,"The Martian directed by Ridley Scott is a Sci-Fi film following a rescue mission to Mars after one man is stranded on the planet... and this movie is GREAT. Within cinema one thing is for sure, when Ridley makes a great film it's monumental. The Martian is one of my all time favourites. The shots and cinematography on Mars are truly out of this world... The editing, score and integration of CGI is outstanding. This film is put together beautifully. Although The Martian isn't just exceptional on the technical side, it's also insanely entertaining. And that is thanks to the excellent script and line delivery by Matt Damon. This is his best performance in years. He's everything from witty to emotionally fragile, which forms such a complex and compelling character. The Martian has a perfect balance of distress and great humour. I love the integration of music by David Bowie and ABBA. It really helps lift up the spirit. The large cast doesn't weigh down the film at all, as they all add something more to the story. I can honestly watch The Martian countless times and never get bored. This is an outstanding film so therefore I give it a 10."
" Space Soapera
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,6,"Okayish movie with some funny moments but very predictable story and therefore in no way a masterpiece like some claim but rather the typical Hollywood astro-blockbuster like Armageddon, Deep Impact etc.Not really bad but also not really good. At max an one-timer. That rescue mission based on some real science/physics!? My a**."
" Astronaut Ice Cream
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,6,It is a highly sophisticated and technical survival film that is surely engrossing. Despite the gravitational pull to be an emotional drama The Martian adopts a cavalier attitude which is its greatest strength even if it shorts itself in the process. Like Astronaut Ice Cream it's fascinating but albeit extremely light as well.
" Best space movie.
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,8,"Way better and interesting than Interstellar. Interstellar makes you sleepy, but this....doesn't."
" Dreadful Hollywood dross
",2019-03-11 00:00:00,1,"The story is awful, the acting is abominable, the script is cheesy, the casting is overly PC, the science is an insult to anyone's intelligence.Do not waste your time with this dreadful Hollywood dross."
" Superb
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,9,"As good a Sci-fi film as you can ever
hope to see.
No monsters, no aliens. None needed."
" A stupendous film that gives a good visual representation of Andy Weir's novel.
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,10,"I, for one, am excited that space travel is now a topic regularly covered on the big screen. If the general public becomes even a little bit more interested in interplanetary travel, perhaps I can see man stand on the surface of Mars in my lifetime. The Martian (2015) is merely the latest in a string of space-themed sci-fi movies that brings the excitement of outer space to theaters. While not nearly as continually intense as Gravity (2013), or as epic as Interstellar (2014), what The Martian does right is give a sense of scale to the challenge of returning to Earth from being abandoned on Mars.Gripping and just humorous enough to keep it from being dour, director Ridely Scott uses many cinematic techniques, including several montages, to tell the story many have already read from Andy Weir's novel of the same name. While many sequences and scientific explanations were obviously cut for the sake of time, the ones that remain help maintain the ebb and flow of victory and tragedy. Like many films based on books, I saw the movie first before committing to reading the book. After now having read the source material, I can say that each version has its merits, and both are equally as spectacular. Sure, there were some elements I wish were in the film, but that's why reading the book version is great too: it has ""deleted scenes.""Matt Damon's portrayal of Mark Watney was spot on, and the rest of the cast certainly did a great job of filling in their respective roles. The pacing was great and the CGI looked incredible. Considering the current array of NASA equipment, the ships and shelters used for a Mars mission certainly seemed realistic in this film, which should help with my aforementioned desire for the general public to become interested in interplanetary travel.A stupendous film that gives a good visual representation of Andy Weir's novel, I give The Martian 5.0 stars out of 5."
" A gripping story, well told. Best sci-fi movie of 2015.
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,9,"Entertaining. Just what one should want from a movie. Great acting, great story, good effects and a plot that doesn't have many obvious loopholes. Recommendation for a rainy day."
" Modular plot with qualified special effects
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,8,"Modular plot with qualified special effects, mixed with a little popular science, inspiration, patriotic plot, to reconcile a favorite commercial film by film critics"
" Uplifting, meaningful, different.
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,10,"This is one of the few movies where the antagonist is, for the most part, just an uncaring non-human hostile environment. Also you do not see many movies where the protagonist doesn't get by on his wit, or prayers, or hope, but by ""Sciencing the s---"" out of everything.Different is good, I give it 10/10."
" Really worth the time
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,10,The film deserves a rating of more than 10 I loved the film very much and the actor was very wonderful in performing his role in perfectness and the story was meticulous and purposeful continued to produce such wonderful films
" Solid space/Mars movie
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,7,"Since I see people expecting too much of the movie, I really don't know what to say, besides that it is solid. It had moments where I thought it was a great and interesting movie. Time passed by fairly quickly.
Maybe missing some parts to make it an alltime classic, but it's close."
" Watchable
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,6,"The movie's storyline and the whole plot was pretty interesting and makes you wonder how courageous our astronauts are without whome these extraordinary research wouldn't have been possible.The whole Mars scene felt intense but overall the movie didn't feel extraordinary, it was average. The makes tried to make the movie dramatic and serious which didn't gel much with the funny attitude our lead character had according to me.I think the movie is watchable but you don't really miss anything if you let it pass."
" Nice try, NASA
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,10,"Contrary to what is purported in NASA's feeble attempt to grasp the hearts, minds, and wallets of the average American, there is no life on Mars except for the FICTIONAL ""documentary"" of a failed space pilot mission that went awry from its conception. This isn't the first time in history that the American government has tried to pass off space travel as a reality. Who can we really trust these days?"
" Mars Cast Away?
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,7,"Great character arc, solid story, simple setting, good acting.
Overall solid movie with some ""Cast Away"" vibes and will have you on the edge of the seat. (Though just from watching the trailer, I kind of thought that there would be aliens) Realistic sci-fi are quite rare these days, so the visuals and color in this movie seem new and unique.
A movie that everyone can enjoy."
" A Tad Disappointing
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,7,"3 October 2015. This is a survival story about a stranded astronaut on Mars starring Matt Damon. Surprisingly this movie doesn't seem like one that Ridley Scott directed. It has much more of a popular, mainstream undertone to it much like what Clint Eastwood accomplished with his Space Cowboys (2000). Two minor weaknesses seem to occur in the movie where like Alfonso Cauron's Gravity (2013) the opening scene appears too theatrically cute instead of a more serio-comically compelling and authentic sharp realism like that directed by Stanley Kubrick as with his 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). Gravity at least transforms into a more serious dramatic and intimate performance unlike The Martian which seems to retain more of a space opera format and hoping the use of hard technology throughout would somehow make this movie superlative. The mainstream, popularity flourish that Ridley Scott incorporates into this movie permeates most of the dialogue and performances that takes away from the visceral immediacy of the moment. A smaller problem occurs with Ridley Scott's use of oral narrative between Watney and others as the text messages are being typed to simply inform audience of what is being said. I imagine that by the time a real Mar's mission is underway a redundant system of both visual and audio communication will be common place. Even today with the Dragon Program, it's possible to provide text and oral computer communication simultaneously. A computer synthesized voice instead of the actor's speaking their own lines would have had much more of a sensory impact. At the very least a computer program could have been downloaded to Watney's base station to allow for this oral/text transmission.In the end what Ridley Scott seems to have accomplished is a photographically gorgeous setting and set design that, however, still can't be sufficiently enhanced into perfect reality with today's 3-D imaging technology. Other more powerful, visually dramatic and appealing, and intense performances having space as its primary subject matter include:Ridley Scott's Alien (1979). Tom Hank's Apollo 13 (1995). Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997). Maria Lidon's Stranded (2001). Duncan Jones' Moon (2009). Defying Gravity (2009 television series). Gonzalo Lopez-Gallegos' Apollo 18 (2011). Alfonso Cauron's Gravity (2013) Christopher Nolan's Interstellar (2014).What would have been spectacular would have been whether or not Ridley Scott could have followed in the approach of William Eubank's Love (2011) about an abandoned astronaut aboard the International Space Station or William Eubank had an opportunity to try to direct The Martian."
" A laughable, unbelievable story. Yet another overhyped blockbuster......
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,3,"It was with great anticipation that I sat down to watch The Martian, a film that had not only been called ""a modern Classic"" but a film that had also registered a high 8.0 rating on IMDB. My enthusiasm lasted around 15 minutes. The rest of the film was completely unbelievable, with a storyline so dull the director thought he had to intersperse 70's music to keep it alive. Matt Damon played a man who was alone on a planet millions of miles from Earth yet his character had the depth of a sparrow. I have no idea what some other notable actors were doing in this film and it looked like they didn't know either! A dreadful waste of time as was; Interstellar, Arrival and Gravity. Much better modern alternatives are Midnight Special, A Quiet Place and Minority Report."
" One of the best Martian movie I have ever seen
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,8,"The Martian is an adventure, drama and Sci-fi movie. The movie talks about an astronaut lost on Mars. I liked the movie because the movie has an original plot compared to others movies of the type. I like the plot because I like Mars and I dream that the humanity colonize Mars in the future. I really like the cast because Mark Watney ( Matt Damon in the movie ) plays well. For example, he succeed to give his feeling in the movie to the viewers. I very like the special effects because they are amazing and realistic. For example, the starship is realistic and realizable in real life.
Finally, I want to say that the sound is not amazing but it is good.
In conclusion, If you hate America and Martian movies, you shouldn't watch The Martian."
" Pretty damn good
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,8,"Matt Damon awesome as always.Not the perfect story, not perfectly believable but good & worth a watch."
" Interesting survival film
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,6,"This is an interesting twist on the survival film, and it's very interesting to watch his attempts at survival. However, I never really felt that Damon's character showed any strong emotions to make him extremely relatable."
" A nice balance of science, drama and humor
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,8,"I liked The Martian. This film has a nice balance of science, drama and humor. Matt Damon is able to hold his own on his own and the rest of the cast rounds out the story nicely. It drags at times, there are some pretty big plot conveniences and the visual effects sometimes look a little cartoon-y, but overall this was a very compelling film to watch."
" There is no Gravity on Mars
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,8,"First of all, this is no ""Interstellar"" nor Gravity"" though you might think otherwise... This is a movie about ""could a human live in Mars?"". It's basically a movie about survival and what man has to do in the so red planet. Don't expect any bad guys or action or shooting cause this is not that kind of movie.That said, the movie is very scientifically accurate (or at least they try) and you spend the whole time of it waiting to see how it ends, if it's a success or a failure, if he survives or not... (you will have to watch it in order to know the answer).Matt Damon does an amazing job, although you might think about his role in ""Interstellar"" this one has nothing to do with it (NOTHING). Here you can feel his solitude, his longing to survive, and he spends much of the movie doing that, you see what he has to do in order to survive and how he does it. He is the movie.The movie is pretty good and pretty interesting because it makes you ponder if mankind could live in Mars or in any other planet. It's a survival movie.Review written: 10/10/2015"
" Outstanding adventure
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,8,"I had checked concerning the major plot. It roundly grabbed my attention. I had watched this movie in the cinema. It was really fascinating. It has eye-catching visual effects, intelligible theme and a long journey. The epitome of other space movies. Especially, having an stupendous atmosphere in the planet as well as the fiction. Matt Damon was a thespain who would undertake this role perfectly, resuming the battle of surviving in the mars after the accident despite loneliness. It was an extraordinary experience for him.
Ridley Scott knows how to convert the story of a book into a movie and affect the people positively. One of the most favorite genres of Ridley Scott with his perseverences. He almost gives a favorable impression to the mind of the cinemagoers. I recommend all science-fiction fans to watch this with a great joy."
" YOU SHOULD FIRST READ THE BOOK
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,7,"If you liked this movie its too short for storyline , there are too much missing sol and they did't mention about duct tape, its a shame for them :("
" An awesome and FUN movie!
",2018-12-05 00:00:00,10,"Please ignore the stupid negative people criticizing this movie! They are just TOO narrow minded and oblivious to fun and adventure. They're the type of people who are never happy with anything and/or have too much money in a stuck up society to know how to see the fun in things!
This movie was such a joy to watch!!"
" Brilliant.
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,9,"Except for the silly lights in the ""Hollywood"" space helmets. Real martian space helmets would not have internal lights dazzling the astronaut.
Come on Hollywood, get real!"
" just not real not at all
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,5,I have tremendous respect for the work of ridley scott but this movie was easily his worst.its great fault was it was not real.if you wanna see the life and threats of an astronaut go watch APPOLO13 or FIRST MAN.if you wanna know what's the real feeling to having eat half a potato for a day go watch HUNGER by steve mcqueen.this movie just made me feel angry and frustrated.i mean to say have you ever seen someone so much happy and thrilled as Mark Watney after he knows he will probably die.you may argue that he was determined to live but thats not real you should have determination but theirs always a danger that this might be your last sight that was simply with Mark Watney.HE SEEMED SO HAPPY THAT HIS CREW LEFT HIM ISOLATED IN MARS.that was quite evident in the scene where he writes his name on the ship in such a thrilling manner.Another thing was that the whole world doesnt care if an astronaut returns or not believe me noone does
" Best space movie
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,10,"This beat all the other space movies, for sure. Adventure, Action, all that and your not geting bored."
" life on mars
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,10,Review: I enjoyed this movie because it proves that it is possible in theory to survive on mars. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.

Story, characters, dialogue. It is all sublime.
Matt Damon is at his absolute best and the rest just follows.
This movie is about one man in extreme circumstances overcoming obstacles.
It's great! And definately worth a watch."
" should have fired the casting director
",2018-10-25 00:00:00,5,"The cast the f....in cast. Kate mara, Michael peña, Ewetel..., every line by these guys and a couple others cuts out any storyline progression done by matt damon and crew or by the vfx. At the end of the day these guys are brilliant at physics, math other techy stuff. not saying ""i can fix that"" and sounding like a car mechanic."
" Unexpectedly believable and even touching
",2018-10-25 00:00:00,8,"When this movie first came out I was hesitant whether to watch it at all. The premise about a man stranded all alone on Mars for months and coming out of it alive sounded completely ridiculous. If it was a comedy plot then maybe, but for an SF drama, it was too much over the top. Additionally, I'm not a big fan of Matt Damon. But after a few really positive reviews I decided to give it a try. And I was pleasantly surprised. The totally unbelievable premise was turned into an extremely believable movie. I'm not too good at physics, but I suppose the story is full of scientific holes. Still, for a laic, this movie offers quite convincing and touching human drama, supported with awesome visuals, a touch of humor and probably the best Damon's performance so far, shoulder to shoulder with his role in ""Good Will Hunting"". Ridley Scott proved his worth once again.8/10"
" What a beautiful film.

" Amazing

" A superb film showcasing both the beauty of the universe and the ingenuity and survivability of mankind.
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,10,"Entertaining throughout due to the interesting subject matter, the light hearted approach, and great acting from the cast, especially Damon. Gets a bit too unbelievable towards the end, but still gripping to watch, with fantastic special effects."

They do all they can to try to save him.The Martian was a great film. Ridley Scott did a great job. The casting was also great. Matt Damon did an outstanding job. He was hard to catch up to in this film. Jessica Chanstain did a great job. She was really close to Damon. She just came out of a major film called Interstellar before this one. She has done great in space movies. The effects were top notch. They looked like they could have been on Mars. The adaption from the book was really good.The Martian is a great movie.

",2018-10-08 00:00:00,10,"My Grandma sent this movie up for Christmas 2 or 3 years ago. She had seen it, and said it was quite good. (I had seen it in the cinema fliers when it first came out, but hadn't thought it interesting.) After Grandma's recommendation, I was expecting it to be good.I was blown away! I had expected it to be good. But it was really, REALLY good! Greatly exceeded my expectations.The story is this: in 2035 (the year isn't mentioned in the movie - only the bonus features, and apparently the novel (which I haven't read)), during a manned mission to Mars, a massive and powerful sand storm forces the crew to evacuate the planet. Unfortunately, one of the astronauts, Mark Watney (Matt Damon) suffers an accident in the storm, and is (justifiably) presumed dead. They are forced to leave without him.However, Mark is not dead. He manages to make his way to the Hab that the crew had been staying in, where he fixed his wound (the only hard-to-watch scene in the movie). He must try and survive on a desert planet - and try and make contact with NASA. Meanwhile, by viewing satellite images of the Hab (showing equipment moved since the crew of the ship - the Ares - evacuated), realise he is still alive. They begin planning an attempt to save Watney, AND try to make contact with him.The movie's plot is brilliantly constructed and executed. Many condemned the film's light tone, but I actually quite enjoyed it. It's a refreshingly uplifting movie. If you want a horror movie, go watch ""Alien"" or something.The acting in the film is great, as is the sense of humour. It's surprisingly genuinely funny. But the special effects are breathtaking. They're truly GREAT.Overall, The Martian is an extremely enjoyable and entertaining science fiction tale of survival that is VERY scientifically accurate (much more so than your average sci-fi). It's highly recommended."
" Matty!!
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,7,Damon does an excellent job here. It really leaves you with a sense of isolation. I strongly recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen this after 3 years!
" It's a movie, not a documentary.
",2018-10-06 00:00:00,10,I love sciences and love this movie. It doesn't follow the laws of physics. But not entirely unrealistic. Enjoy it. Rate it as the movie it is not a documentary.
" A corporate drama.
",2018-10-06 00:00:00,1,"I'm giving this movie only 1, cause I'm sure that the overall rating isn't an exactly right. It should be somewhere in a range from 5.5 to 6.5 tops.
Again, instead of showing the beauty of Mars, space travels, we see China's help, bureaucracy, music from the 70's and lots of work of the higher ranked managers of NASA (WTF guys?).
The movie has nothing to do with reality. It looks like a fairy tail with a happy ending under a ranch of what is named a space something thing...
I am determined that management of any possible Space Agency has nothing in common with progress in any space program. Only a real scientist can (or capable) understand the real needs of a scientific business (like a journey to Mars). And the corporate culture has no place in that at all."
" Amazing!
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,8,"Based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel of the same name. The Martian directed by Ridley Scott stars Matt Damon as the stranded astronaut on Mars who is presumed dead. What he does to survive and what NASA does to ensure his return to Earth forms the crux of the story.
Hope and the will to survive is something which keeps us going even in the toughest of times and this movie exactly shows us that, never to give up even if everything goes south. 
I haven't read the book so i cannot say anything on that, but the movie on the whole is just exquisite and a treat to watch. All the stuff shown in the movie right from growing crops on mars to creating water do have scientific backing and are realistic somehow which is one of the biggest highlights of the movie. The movie is believable and although it is a work of fiction, it can be very real. 
The movie has some amazing VFX to boast about to go with the great story and narration. The climax in particular is so good that i had my mouth open in Awe of the whole scene. 
We have had movies like Gravity and Interstellar in the past couple of years and it will be safe to say that The Martian overtakes both of them as it is more of a complete movie than the other two. Collections won't be a problem as it is gonna shower the box office with a lot of money. It's a visual and mental treat, so do go and watch it peeps and bask in the awesomeness of it. P. S Sean Benn does not die in thus one 😂😂??👏"
" Nothing compared to book
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,7,"I have listened audiobook Martian three times and I really enjoyed all those little technical details - movie is nothing like it - 95% of details were skipped, as usually movie is way behind a book, so be warned."
" I'M SURPRISED
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,8,"Okay let me get things straight, I had watched Christopher Nolan's Interstellar in the end of 2014 and I was just mind blown. The CGI, the acting, the storyline, the plot. It was all beautiful. Probably the best space film I've seen. How do you top that?You go in a completely different direction. Instead of exploring planets... Why not get stuck on one?Yep, that's what The Martian is about and I honestly didn't have too high expectations for this film. But I just had to watch it since Matt Damon was in it and he's probably one of the best actors out there. When I exited the theater I was honestly. Just baffled. Here I thought I had seen a film you couldn't top, Interstellar. The Martian gave Nolan a run for his money. The whole movie is centralized around Matt Damon and is basically a solo performance by him. And he didn't disappoint. He engaged and immersed millions of people into a traumatic and emotional outer space experience and I have to say. The video effects are scary real. I just don't have any words to say about the Martian, just a beautiful film. One of my top favorites. At the end, I score this film an 8.4/10, the same I scored Interstellar."
" I made the mistake of reading the novel before watching the movie
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,5,"Ok it's plain and simple: the novel is awesome. It was a joy ride reading it from the first page to the last. The movie is not. It's average. And here's why: I'm not American. No, I don't like clapping and cheering. I actually hate it. And a major part of this movie is about how great NASA and their diverse employees overcome all obstacles and save Marc. Hurray! Just stick to the book."
" Snappy dialogue and aesthetically-pleasing visuals elevate a predictable and sometimes silly story.
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,7,"'The Martian (2015)' is neither a musical nor a comedy, though it's definitely a film with Matt Damon's face on the poster (behind a wall of text, of course, so that it fits in with all the other Damon/ Text-wall marketing). This space-based survival story strands its hero as far away from Earth as is plausibly possible in a pseudo science-fiction, but apparently more 'science-fact', picture and focuses on the ingenuity of humanity - or, rather, of a specific human - as good old-fashioned agriculture combines with modern day technology to bring life to even the most barren of places. The piece is pretty entertaining throughout, even if it is predictable and becomes downright silly towards its overblown finale. These issues dampen the sense of stakes somewhat, though individual sequences are still suspenseful, and reduce possible audience investment. Still, they don't eliminate the enjoyment that comes from the snappy dialogue, aesthetically-pleasing visuals and 'inspiring' central story. 7/10"
" Stretched out but enjoyable
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,7,"The Martian is a film about an astronaut, Mark Watney (Matt Damon), who is inadvertently left stranded on Mars. There was a very bad storm and the crew thinks that Mark died in the storm. They perform an emergency take off to get out of the storm and consequently Mark is left behind. With limited rations to keep himself alive, until he can be rescued, Mark must get created to survive. His role in the crew was as a botanist and it comes in handy for Mark's survival. 
I believe there are two general themes in The Martian. First off, the isolation Mark has to endure while on Mars completely alone is a test in itself. Mark does not directly discuss the hardships of being alone but he displays several emotions surrounding the fact that he is alone and scared. For example, when he first makes contact with Earth and realizes they are aware of his survival he breaks down in tears of joy. Mark also copes with being alone by speaking to his diary camera and he using these to make jokes regarding his situation. The other theme of this movie is perseverance. The perseverance of Mark Watney is display in this film over and over again. One example of Mark's perseverance is when he realizes he does not have enough food rations to survive long enough to get rescued. Instead of giving up, Mark decides to pull together all of his scientific knowledge and figure out a solution. Mark gets very creative and finds a way to grow potatoes on Mars. During his process of discovering a process to grow potatoes, Mark nearly blows himself up and learned from this mistake. He perseveres through this mistake and keeps going on. Mark's persaverence reminds me of the strong perserverance of Andy Dufresne in The Shawshank Redemption where the never give up attitude is on display. 
One scene where the director used visual techniques to interpret the action was when Mark was re-entering the Hab and it exploded. There was a small hole in the side of the airlock that caused a breach in the air pressure, resulting in an explosion. During this scene it rapidly switches from a first person view to a third person view. By shooting from the point of view of Mark, the director utilizes a subjective point of view in order to emotionally intensify the scene for the viewer. I believe this was a very effective way to shoot the scene because switching from third and first person makes the action more chaotic and intense for the viewer. This scene is another excellent example of Mark's perseverance because he could have just gave up and left the Hab in its wrecked condition. Instead Mark chose to repair it and continue his fight for survival."
" Predictable and really boring.
",2018-09-07 00:00:00,1,"As one reviewer already said: ""2 hours and 21 minutes of Matt Damon gardening, and people at NASA discussing how to rescue him. Seriously. That's the whole movie. Total boredom."" I would just add that there is no any twists and turns in the story, we all know Matt Damon is going to be saved and we are just waiting two loooong boring hours for it to happen."
" Excellent Sci-Fi Adventure
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,9,"Fine example of how Science Fiction should be! Suspenseful, dramatic, splashes of humor with a lot of realism make this movie worth watching. Mark Watney is presumed dead after an accident and left behind on the planet Mars alone. Mark awakens and has the strong will to survive - he finds a way to contact NASA but NASA runs into problems in getting Mark back home. Time is running out - can they bring Mark back to Earth before it's too late? 9/10"
" Ok
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,7,"Common problem like with a lot of space movies, its predictable and sometimes even boring and unrealistic."
" Rather Good
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,7,"Set in the near future, a NASA astronaut (Matt Damon) is stranded on Mars. NASA attempts to bring him home.It's easy to compare ""The Martian"" to other popular science-fiction films. The Damon character is like the earthling version of ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"". His situation is also similar to that of the Sandra Bullock character in ""Gravity"".""The Martian"" is entertaining even if it doesn't meet the higher level of the other films mentioned nor of many other well loved sci-fi films such as ""Apollo 13"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". There is a lot of scientific jargon that is difficult to understand for the average viewer and the movie seems a bit long. There is also a fair share of cheesy, sentimental jingoism that is cringeworthy at times. Just one more grudge: the main character seems to reflect the writers in holding a 30-plus year grudge against the fact that some people like disco music of the 70s. (Get over it, man-boys.)But overall, ""The Martian"" is enjoyable. Damon (like Bullock in ""Gravity"") is more than able to live up to the difficult task of keeping the viewer interested in long scenes while being the only person on screen. The NASA staff also seemed to reflect a solid gender and racial diversity. (Hollywood is finally catching up here.) And the very talented director Ridley Scott shows his able hands are at work once again as he did in other great sci-fi flicks ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" and his best work ""Thelma and Louise"".Despite the flaws, it's still entertaining."
" Great movie for the fans of space and humanity
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,10,"This movie explores the mental and physical, stresses of dealing with survival in bleak conditions. Damon does an excellent job showing the emotions and thoughts that come with such a situation. Don't pick it apart, just enjoy it. Supporting cast does a great job and you almost believe the story as it goes on. I won't go into detail on my favorite parts but I'd recommend watching with few or no distractions"
" A movie I could watch over and over
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,10,"I have few movies which I'd be perfectly fine watching over and over again. One of them is Apollo 13 starring Tom Hanks, and I'm so glad I can add The Martian to the list, right next to Apollo 13.Both the book and the movie exceeded my expectations with flying colors. In the past Matt Damon wouldn't have been my first choice for the role of Mark Watney, but I have to admit he did a brilliant job. Now I couldn't imagine anyone else playing Watney as he managed to bring through every emotion of a man who realizes he's alone on a giant red planet, and nobody knows he's there.But of course the best part of the movie is the story and the book behind it. The story could've gone so many different ways, but somehow it managed to do things just right. It makes you gasp, hold your breath and - sometimes - burst into laughter when you least expect it. The brilliance lies in the humor of Watney and how he handles the situation, even when it's more or less clear he's alone and all odds are against him.This here is a story of survival at it's best. Kudos."
" Entertaining enough
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,6,An entertaining film which is let down by the awful dialogue.
" Ridley Scott has not crafted a good film in years
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,4,"Ridley Scott has not crafted a good film in years. This latest installment is unfortunately no exception to this pattern.Taking a broader perspective on Scott's career as a director, one can easily see that he loves to depict a humble protagonist, one who displays nobility of heart, stands up for his/her beliefs and has a moral struggle but tends to choose the ""right path"" even if it is the harder one. I do not mean to say that path is necessarily morally sound from a viewer's perspective, or even from Scott's perspective, but instead it is ""right"" for that character and what they believe is right. Scott is quite practiced at this kind of character, as he's done it in several films: American Gangster, Exodus: Gods and Kings, Gladiator, Robin Hood, Body of Lies, and Kingdom of Heaven, to name a few.In this film, The Martian, Scott attempts to break away from this formula a little bit. We are still centered around one main protagonist who is struggling, but not morally - instead, for his own survival. There's no hard choice to make, no pros and cons to weigh; he is simply fighting for his survival and has to face the reality that he may not get out of it at all and end up dead on Mars.At first I was relieved that finally Scott is trying something else, as his last several films have been formulaic and tiresome. I was even looking forward a bit to seeing what he would do with such a film. But this film brings almost nothing to the table, almost entirely devoid of substance. It is as if the tried and true formula Ridley Scott is known for is actually all he is capable of as a director. I don't mean to say he should never do anything else, because certainly that formula is getting very tiring. I just mean that it says something disconcerting about his directing when his precious formula is taken away and this is the result: a large forgettable black hole of a film.The struggle of survival is a theme tackled by many films, and I do not attack this film thematically. The theme indeed has the potential to deliver something very powerful, emotional, gripping, something that jibes with the human experience as a whole, something that, even if we cannot relate to directly, we can feel for the character going through it. 127 Hours is a great example of a survival story which was done well. We feel the brutality of the situation; he is broken down to the point of drinking his own urine and eventually his spirit breaks down enough to the point of severing his own limb off. Things actually happen that show the character's suffering, brutal things that justify the extreme action taken.Nothing really happens in this film. The plot is virtually null, and the emotional content is non-existent as well. One would expect a survival story to actually contain a bit of struggle, perhaps even some brutality or exploration of extreme states of the human condition, but this films lacks all of those. Almost right away, since he just so conveniently happens to be a botanist, he figures out a way to grow food, and you fully trusted he would do so given his profession. As for water, there is plenty aboard the station. As a viewer, your comfort level in his biological state is very high; he has plenty of food and water to last him quite a while. So that's taken care of promptly. Secondly, the social factor. Loneliness of that scale can be a powerful cinematic element.to take advantage of, but this is also ruined by the film constantly cutting back to Earth, and then he finds a way to start contacting Earth also. So that is also taken care of. Thirdly, missing his friends and family. That just wasn't ever brought up even one time, so that wasn't taken care of so much as it was entirely absent. All this together shows basically zero struggle. Somehow Scott has managed to make a survival story into a cushy, comfortable ride; I never once doubted or was afraid for his life. I don't state this with revere, this kind of contrast is simply baffling and doesn't make sense whatsoever. There were a few occasions where the film tried to throw in a sense of looming doom, like the food supply would reduce or the situation back on Earth would seem hopeless, but these ultimately felt contrived and were tossed in purely superficially; it definitely didn't fool me any.Right in line with the empty plot, character development is also nil. Our protagonist learns nothing, does not change in any fundamental way, nor does any supporting character. He gets left behind on Mars and gets rescued at the end, going back to normal life afterward. Oh, he starts to teach survivalism in extreme space situations, but this is more of an afterthought than a fundamental character change. Jeff Daniels plays the director of NASA; he honestly could've been completely cut out of the film and no significant difference/loss would've occurred. His role was to be the face to the public, as we constantly see him babbling on and on in press conferences about Damon's current state and what NASA is doing to try to rescue him. In fact, most of the scenes and characters on Earth felt pretty pointless. To some level they were obviously needed, as they are the ones who must rescue him, but that didn't make them enjoyable (not that the Mars scenes were much better).I'm not entirely sure how much can be blamed on the novel the film is based on, as I have not read it, but I do believe a director has full control of a film and if a novel is a bit drab, a director can and should breathe more life into it. I have a hunch the novel is not so bad and it is just that Ridley Scott was assuredly the wrong choice for its adaptation into film. It also might seem appropriate to blame the script writer, Drew Goddard, but the dialogue was not so horrible, aside from the mostly banal attempts at humor - though some lines were funny. While I do not ignore the significant role that source novel material and screenplay have, I'm still placing most responsibility onto Scott's lap. He didn't portray any character change, he didn't use a cinematic eye to communicate any substance.As far as acting goes, nothing is particularly terrible, but not much was required either. As a counterexample, Damon's acting in Interstellar was one of the worst performances to ever appear in motion picture history, but this was because it tried to be a very dramatic scene where he attempts to murder the whole crew. His acting simply wasn't good enough to carry that kind of role, so it came off as simply laughable. This film on the other hand doesn't call for much, so his caliber of acting was just fine for it.All this said, there is one thing Scott shines at that I cannot deny, and it is present here also. He makes watchable films. It's hard to describe precisely what this means, but I'll try. It means a film that is entertaining enough, moves along quickly enough, is not completely laughably awful in every way, never gets too slow or boring - I should point out that this is completely different than a film having substance, which I've already said this film lacks. But it is watchable, I'll give it that. Entertaining enough in a popcorn sense - you don't need to pay attention much, because there's really nothing to pay attention to. This makes it more of a lighter affair, which completely contradicts its theme as I've already pointed out. So yes, I admit The Martian is not entirely boring as you're watching it, but after you watch it, there's nothing much to reflect on or take home."
" Hollywood Cheese
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,4,"The once great Ridley Scott continues to disappoint in a film for Matt Damon enthusiasts who enjoy crowd-pleasing silly dialogue & gooey, touching moments with accompanying music that helps you know when you're supposed to feel something. Bring him home? Eh...seems like a lot of work & I'm sure in reality NASA wouldn't bother. And neither should you."
" The Science is right, The Human is not
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,8,"As a Ridley Scott film, it looks beautiful as expected. My favorite part of this film is how well researched it is on the science side. A lot of the science talk isn't nonsense which is always something I look for in good science based films. 
But, there is a fatal flaw that is overlooked by many. The main character, isn't very human.
 Living in isolation I feel should have been one of the biggest issues in this movie. He never seems to be hugely effected by it in any way you'd expect. Even if they did this to draw more attention to the story, that can be considered wrong. Characters are the main part of a story, without them you get a movie that I honestly liked but lacks that completeness that truly incredible movies have. Would I recommend this movie? Yes. Despite what I just said, A lot of people seem to genuinely enjoy this movie. It still is engaging and interesting. Despite the lack of character, I still found myself invested in him and wanting him to get home in one piece. It might not be a masterpiece, but it's definitely worth a watch."
" i like his films but he shouldn't have taken this one.
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,1,"After watching and reading the story and reviews, i wouldn't watch this if you paid me."
" Why the hate
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,8,"Personally i really enjoyed this film and it got me really intrested in the science behind the film. However others are giving it alot of hate not too sure why. Matt damon suited the role well and i felt he really brought some thing special into this film. Along side that the visual effects were wonderful and brought out an awe inspiring first look at the red planet. The only thing that was wrong was the ending. The way he sent himself from the pod to the ship was just absurd 
Overall solid film anyone can enjoy"
" Great movie. Great concept. Good casting. Great writing.
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,9,"Although there is room for improvement, this movie hits well on all cylinders. People need to accept their will never be a perfect movie, which is why I gave this one such high marks. Two movies I consider a 10 are Titanic and Avatar. There are more but these are two examples of my version of a 10,The Martian provides an excellent blend of drama, sci-fi, and comedic moments that are not over the top. The casting was great with the exception of a few roles. There were a few space scenes that are a total farce, but overall they did capture the essence of what it will take to go to Mars.My rating is actually a toss up between 8 and 9 stars."
" Outstanding.
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,8,"A late review I know, but I've seen this film at least 8 times and I still see the brilliance in it.Matt Damon creates a feeling of redundancy, lonliness and hope all at the same time. Definitely on the one to watch before you pop it list."
" Better than field punishment no 1
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,10,"But then again, everything is better than field punishment no 1. I loved the martian."
" very good
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,10,"This is a unique story. And although it is fiction, it is believable, set in the near future.
The casting for this movie is exceptional. Exceptional. The supporting actors show a lot of flexibility.
Definitely worth the second watch."
" Optimistic and Fun
",2018-07-17 00:00:00,10,"This movie is just optimistic and fun, and it's a throwback to old fashioned movies that didn't feel like they needed to be violent or dark to have high stakes. It's always satisfying to see smart people working together to solve problems and succeeding. Great film."
" a great movie!
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,9,"Congratulations to Ridley Scott, this was a great one! I love good science fiction movies, but they are so hard to find. In most ""science fiction"" the ""science"" is thin at best and an excuse for special effects or some absurd action.The Martian is different and it really is a great one! When it started out with this unrealistically strong sandstorm I was ready to bury my hopes, but then it got better and better by the minute. there was one more inaccuracy that was initially a bit off-putting - the non-martian gravity, but apart from that the science was sound. And better yet, it was the core of the action. Getting stranded on a distant planet is challenging :-) and the challenges in the movie felt like they were the real thing. How to survive? How to get food? How to take off? How to reach earth? All these are tricky to figure out and it is a blast to watch a bunch of smart, friendly and cooperating people figure them out - always with that smirk that old-timers know from the heroes of the Apollo days. Yes, they've got the right stuff and they need plenty of it to ""bring him home"".Apart from this technical side, there is something even more wonderful about this movie. Through the extremely intelligent choice of (sometimes very bad) music and little hints here and there it has a curious ""retro"" feeling. It almost makes you feel like this is an alternative reality, playing out sometime in the last decade of the previous century, in a world where after the moon landings we did not stop but just made the logical next move to go to mars. And somehow this feels so right and so upbeat, it is a joy to watch.In any case, the Martian is a joy to watch from beginning to end. After all, whan did you last see a movie that let kept you excited with the intricacies of celestial mechanics?"
" This was well thought out and frankly well done...
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,9,"To be honest, I am not sure where some of the negative reviews came from...but I have to wonder what kinds of movies they consider good...The Martian was simply put together very well, having a realistic plot, and a totally believable story...the scientific accuracy is the best I've ever seen in a scifi movie, and you can relate to what Mark Watney has to go through to survive. There might be a couple scientific inaccuracies, but you'd have to look very closely to pick them out...Yes, ok. The space ship was rather over the top design wise, and the actual rescue stretches credibility a bit...but overrall it is an excellent movie to watch..."
" Very disappointed & I love space movies
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,2,"I grew up when NASA first started sending people into space and it captivated me so much so that I would build models of the spacecraft and hang them out my window when a mission was on. I'm also a fan of Ridley Scott but this movie missed the mark by a wide margin for me. First of all, it is WAY TOO LONG and I found my inner child constantly saying ""are we there yet?"" This was the result of a lack of dramatic tension in the screenplay and lack of depth to the characters. I agree with other viewers who say there should have been more angst about being alone on a planet millions of miles from home. If it was me, I would be freaking out! (Then I would pray). Also some great shots of that isolation against the magnificent universe would have been awesome but we were given none of these.We have seen these movies before done better - my standard is always ""Independence Day"" where you had real character development, dramatic tension, and excellent humor in the script. None of these elements are present in this script. In fact, we know we have been here before, and just like making copies of a tape, successive versions aren't quite as sharp as the original. This movie must have been the 10th copy! Not good enough for a Ridley Scott movie. Matt Damon does well with what he has but he is not given a whole lot to work with. And was it me, or was that a stand in doing the nude scene of Matt emerging from a shower?I would have preferred to see Jeff Goldblum do the lead, though I get it that he is not a big enough box office draw. I think he would have done much more with the thin gruel given to the lead. Waste of talent all around."
" ""SILENT RUNNING"" meets ""MAROONED""
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,3,"As I recall this is the first time I've ever paused a Ridley Scott movie and gone back to it the next day. But on this occasion I did. It's missing that pin that keeps me stuck to my seat. And then it became obvious..... it's missing that chill factor- not the feel good factor. It's missing, but never seen, the grotesque surrounding our man."
" I'm not looking for intellectual brilliance with a movie like this
",2018-05-15 00:00:00,8,"I am looking for enjoyment.It is not ""rocket science"". It's a movie.As recent movies (past 20> years) go, this is very well done. It's interesting from the perspective of ""how would one survive alone on an alien planet"", and it's got humor.Is it the greatest movie ever made? No.Is it entertaining? YES!We have the typical A-hole political suck-butt.We have the smart-aleck scientific types with their quick, rather predictable, tried-and-true repartee.We have Matt Damon as the determined-to-survive castaway.There's the overarching question of WILL HE MAKE IT?No spoilers here. But it's an enjoyable movie given what it is and, given the typical movie making of the 21st Century, it's well done."
" Nothing impressive
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,5,"The Martian starts off setting high expectations when group of astronauts from NASA go on a Mars mission and while they're on the surface of the planet the atmosphere goes out of control, strong winds start blowing and a useless piece of debris hits our male lead Damon right in the ribs and he is pushed back by several meters. The rest of the crew assumes him to be dead and return to Earth only to find out after some days that he is still alive. Not only this but he has also managed to grow potatoes on the surface of Mars, (I couldn't imagine doing so if I were a BOTANIST you know) I mean there's an example of going out of your comfort zone (Earth). That aside, the middle scenes are pretty dull and you will find yourself forward-ing very often. There is a parallel mission going on Earth too to keep Damon fed till the next Mars mission is up and running and not to emphasize that a different politics is in progress there also and an astronaut's life on Mars basically depends it. 
The performances are average, any actor that manages to make any impact would be Jessica Chastain in the role of Martinez. Although the film picks up a little bit towards the end when Damon improvises with his profound knowledge a way to get himself out of a speedy rocket but it isn't too late to realize that you've wasted your precious time watching an economical version of Gravity."
" An Egg That Doesn't Quite Hatch
",2018-04-28 00:00:00,5,"The cast is talented, the scenes look good. So what happened? The writer of The Egg gets the story a bit scrambled and the film is at this point the most over-rated Sci-Fi film on IMDB.If you do not like the theater version, try out the unrated verson with 10 extra minutes on the DVD. This longer version reveals what the cast here truly wanted to do, and did. They take a crisis and make it into a comedy film. Worse yet, they then cut the film to make it look more serious than it was filmed at.Cut is an ending that comedically compares with Slim Pickens riding his bomb down in Dr. Strangelove. The trouble here is that this film is nowhere near as good as it is rated. Maybe Matt Damon and Kristen Wigg have a lot of fans out there, but serious Sci-Fi fans have a whole lot of issues with this one.Thw science is just not right. The premise is not much better. The films plays like the shooting budget got slashed after they started it. Funny, but sad considering the talents wasted."
" Good for the first 90 minutes but tediously overlong
",2018-04-09 00:00:00,6,"The first hour is interesting and engaging but the plot starts to tail off after 90 minutes and the final hour is dull and irritating. The attempts at humourous scenes fall flat and detract from the tension which has been building. Ditto the choice of music - as if 2001 A Space Odyssey had used Priscilla Queen of the Desert for its soundtrack. Ultimately, this film seems to be confused about what it wants to be. It starts out as a gripping thriller but then turns into something weirdly light-hearted. A pity, it showed promise but didn't deliver."
" Good film if you do not mind a little Star Trek type script...
",2018-04-05 00:00:00,9,"The movie mixed science fiction with a real life portrayal of life in space fairly well. Plot also examines the politics of space disasters as well. There is some Star trek dialog in the script, which may or may not turn some people off. Part of the movie that pissed me off was that it did not seem to give much credit to Rich Purnell for his idea...(see movie). Brian Ghilliorri"
" Cast Away on Mars with Matt Damon
",2018-04-04 00:00:00,6,"The title says everything i need to say. Apart from the fact that it is far more fun to watch Tom Hanks doing nothing, than Matt Damon. 
I'd assume anyone rating this over a 7/10 is a Matt Damon fanboy."
" It's a fictional movie people; enjoy it for what it is...
",2018-03-30 00:00:00,6,"I watched this film and enjoyed it because it's not considered non-fiction; it's a fictional account of what might happen if an astronaut were abandoned on Mars. Too many people who are submitting reviews are trying to get too technical. People, just enjoy the movie for what it is."
" Strove to present correct science.....REALLY??
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,7,"Generally the movie was good....lots of quasi-science which, although improbable, didn't stretch the bounds too far but the ending......really?
We're supposed to believe that the rocket nose....in order to save weight, jettisons the hard cap and replaces it with....wait for it....CANVAS.
If you do the math, the only speed quoted, which is BEFORE the maximum thrust, converts to about 2600 kilometers per hour.
Now I've put my arm out the window at about 150 KPH and had the hair nearly blown off so I'm pretty sure 2600 KPH is more than a little improbable.
Since the entire movie is predicated on hoping we will believe at least some of the science why couldn't they have just picked a smaller number to reduce it which didn't entail removing all the windows and the nosecone 'cause I'm pretty sure they'd be necessary at 2600 KPH....just saying."
" Project Elrond
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,8,"A NASA crew on Mars evacuates during a bad storm, Mark (Matt Damon) is believed dead and is left behind. However, he is not dead and needs to be resourceful to survive until the next mission, over a year away. However it it not as bad as ""Gravity"" or ""Cast Away"" without Wilson. Mark (plot spoiler revealed in previews) manages to make contact with Earth and we have a subplot to break up the monotony of a one man play.The film is designed primarily for science geeks. There is a lot of terms for them, many are broken down, some inanely as when a sling shot effect had to be explained to the head of NASA, something they do all the time.With all the hype of an Oscar nomination, I thought the film would have been better. It was good, I enjoyed it, but I don't believe it belongs in the Science Fiction hall of fame. There are no space aliens, ghosts, or anything crazy like that. Science fiction, not science fantasy.As far as science goes, my understanding is that Martian soil has a high perchlorate content hindering plant growth. Also NASA is leery of sending anyone to Mars as the radiation dose they will get on a round trip would be considered a lifetime dose for the astronauts, ending their careers and greatly increasing the risk of a latent radiation induced cancer etc."
" Fantastic film
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,10,"Excellent film: the science is accurate, the acting is solid, and the film carries an emotional depth that previous reviewers, who have been panning it, seem to have missed (but maybe they're not used to films where spaceships DON'T make noise in the vacuum in space and the audience actually has to think). One of Ridley Scott's best films."
" A film about growing potatoes with poop
",2018-02-23 00:00:00,1,A film about growing potatoes with poop. That's it.
" Fantastic
",2018-02-13 00:00:00,8,"It was well made, sure, but Childish Gambino was in it, so it's fantastic. Too bad Sean Bean did not die. Was disappointed. That'll happen."
" Great EFX but a bit preposterous, boring, yet spellbinding?
",2018-01-25 00:00:00,9,"With 1100 reviews, I suppose that few people may read this, but here goes: Fantastic sets and special effects. I wish I had seen this on a big screen. I am sure that it has been compared to everything from ""2001"" to ""Apollo 13"". It seems a bit tedious, but that might be because of the 3 hour cable broadcast time if you don't DVR it. An astronaut presumed dead is accidentally left behind when a long-term Mars Mission is aborted due to an intense hurricane force Martian sand storm is encountered. The first third of the movie centers on how Astronaut ""Mark"" manages to set up housekeeping, grow his own crops, and re-establish communications with Houston Control. Then it shift gears and become a rescue mission much like Apollo 13. There are equipment failures along the way and the mission crew almost commits mutiny when they decide to double back and rescue the stranded man. Smart and intelligently presented by Ridley Scott but not everyone's ""cup of tea"". I enjoyed it but found many badly-answered plot hole questions: There seems to be an unlimited supply of oxygen in the space suits. Maybe they can manufacture it in the suit? The ""Power of Duct Tape"" creates a perfect air seal. (I guess it really is the handyman's secret weapon?) A partial nudity shower scene is really unnecessary. Even after a clear plastic seal blows out, the entire craft doesn't fog up and blow apart? Oh, well, enjoy it for what it is, but don't expect it all to make perfect sense."
" The Martian Damon died in a challenge inside and outside the film.
",2018-01-19 00:00:00,8,"The movie Mars may not be a logical or purely scientific film, but certainly succeeded in satisfying everyone as a film science fiction exciting. The film is directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon and Jessica Shastin. It is believed that Mark has died and left alone on Mars, and begins a struggle to survive while trying to communicate. On earth, in the hope of saving him, Marc remains without a thing in this planet, which is twice as large as the Earth, and there is nothing but himself and what the crew left before the forced departure.One of the film's problems that you may read about is the storm that led to Mark's departure in the first place. Mars's atmosphere is about 1% as compared to the Earth, so Mars winds, which may reach 100 mph ""which is rare in the Mars climate"" would be like winds at ten miles an hour on Earth, Flying a paper plane in the sky not to fall humans.Beyond that film is excellent in almost all respects, since the beginning of the film can not stop stunned by what Ridley Scott of visual effects, and continue to amaze something something with the stages of passage of the film. The film begins in a desert desert similar to the environment of Mars, as we know from the images of him, red, arid, empty, filled with horrifying silence.The film moves to two stages. The film then moves to two sides, the psychological aspect of Mark being that he has nothing more than he can think of getting to his home and family, and the aspect that makes him one of the most responsible and discoverable people. Here lies the details, the film may not be perfect in writing. Both are in these two sides.When you see a movie that tells the story of the horror of loneliness, you have to think of two aspects (psychological and physical). The physical aspect I thought for a moment was that Matt Damon's work was a mighty example until I knew that the whole thing was just an effect on a computer, which increases visual dazzling and its effects and reduces The actor's creativity and sacrifices for the role.
In an interview with Matt Damon, he said he wanted to lose weight for the role, but director Ridley Scott stopped him. ""He talked to Ridley about losing weight for the role, because I had already done it for the movies, Almost a month ago I said that the time is perfect. I can lose 30 to 40 pounds and start shooting from the end scenes back to the beginning until I get back to my normal body. ""Riddle Scott"" replied ""F * ck that"".As for the psychological side, yes, there was a conflict, and yes, Dimon was good at it, but it was not enough for me to see the dramatic dramas, being on Mars, knowing that you are 140 million miles from Earth, home, home, family. Because you will not see human beings after today in your life, it is very frightening once you think about it, so I had a desire to stress on a dramatic scene that would be screaming and whining and then supplication and crying. but it's okay.Some may notice the American championship in the film, or even the mathematical complexities, when we calculate the number of years between Mars and the Earth or the speed of Mark's or even attraction between the planets and others, but the film certainly did not make it more sophisticated than the movie Nolan among the stars, Understand some of them and do not mind their presence, because it will not actually stop them, in turn will increase the quality of the scientific background of the film, which puts it in a challenge with the scientists who will see it.The film is not the ideal film in all its analogies, but it is certainly interesting to the viewer, a victory for Ridley Scott the rest of the workers, from the voices to the visual effects and even fashion .. A poetic and objective film at the same time, and above all we can not but stand in hugs for the creativity of Matt Damon and his grandmother to portray The scene of the dramatic car and the rest of the film with complete creativity.

" dumbing down the book spoiled the screenplay
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,1,"I read the book and also listened to the audiobook several times now. The charm of the story for me is, that it heavily emphasizes the Science in Sci-Fi. The whole thing is (mostly) sound and very well explained, so even technical illiterate readers can follow. 
For this movie someone decide to dumb down the content and take shortcuts and - surprise - mistakes, failures and plot holes ensue and some things simply make no sense anymore (just look at the goofs list - you could make a book out of them). Then again some scenes were unnecessarily added to confuse even further to make up for plot twists that were cut.
This messy screenplay can't be saved by the cast. Most of the characters are but a faint shadow of their book selves. Take crewman Vogel for example. Would anybody have guessed him to be German, if it wasn't for the patch on his suit? Jeff Daniels seems to wear a stiff neck and all the characters interactions feel like packed in cotton. Those guys should be passionate and fight for their opinions especially since the lives of astronauts are on the line and depend on their decisions. They are highly trained specialists in their field of work and have to fight against political red tape. Non of this was in the movie. They could have had a more passionate discussion about a burgers or football.
And don't even get me started on the props. Think about airplane furniture and then shave that down even more to get rid of any unnecessary gram, while barely preserving basic function. Where was that in the movie? The Hub looked like it was built to house colonists for decades and not to serve as a pressurized shelter for a two month mission. The movie-Hermes consists mostly of large corridors without any purpose and large window panes. A spaceship like this would never be approved.
I could go on forever, but it all boils down to this: Andy Weir went to great length to make the plot and every action the protagonist take plausible and get his book scientifically correct. That's what I love about it and why I was looking forward to the movie. And then I got handed this stupid, dumbed down, senseless piece of trash."
" Great, realistic, space adventure
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"'The Martian' is based on Andy Weir's excellent novel - one of my favourite books from last year. It's a very simple concept - in the near-future, a manned-mission to Mars goes awry and Mark Watney (Damon) is presumed dead, as the rest of the team returns to Earth. However, rumours of Watney's demise were exaggerated and he just manages to survive, only to be faced with the conundrum of how to stay alive on a freezing planet with almost no food, water or oxygen until he can be rescued?It's beautifully shot, with Jordan a good stand-in for Mars on most occasions, and the CGI doing the rest. And there's obviously a few shots of Earth from space - always a great perspective to see. Scott directs well, with the pacing good, and time spread across the strong cast - Chastain, Peña, Mara, Stan and Hennie on the spaceship home; and Daniels, Ejifor, Bean and Wiig at NASA - showing how everyone involved deals with the initial tragedy and then attempted rescue mission(s).However, the film belongs to Damon, who has to use all his charm and skills to make one man talking to a video journal interesting. The film's possibly 15min or so too long, but luckily, it's a great book & a good screenplay, so there's plenty of levity to go along with the serious life-or-death/fingernail-chewing moments. Tense/great final 25min or so. Never quite reaches the heights of the book, but comes very close."
" Great Scott
",2017-12-31 00:00:00,10,Some reviewer on this site said don't trust any reviews that give this film more than 2 stars because they aren't genuine. Well let me say having just watched it that I wouldn't trust any review that give it less than 7 stars. If this was La La Land I would have agreed as that was overrated rubbish but this was superbly crafted wonderfully acted and a joy to behold. Not at any time during its 141 mins was I not totally engrossed and exhilarated by this total cinematic experience. I'll even go as far as to say this maybe the best film that Ridley Scott has directed.
" Captures the excitement, humor, and humanity of the book
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,8,"Full disclosure: I read (and enjoyed) this book. So I'm going to be one of those people who says ""They got this right, but they got this wrong."" Bottom line, though, they adapted this REALLY well. Scott captured what survival and problem solving looks like, and managed all the excitement/humor/humanity that made the book great. I would have loved a little more explanation and a little less self-seriousness, but there's no way not to enjoy this ride."
" Smart, thrilling, and surprisingly funny
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,9,"Super good, enjoyed this one a lot. Sort of a mix of Castaway and Gravity with Matt Damon taking on the deserted Hanks role, explaining things to a video diary along the way after he is left stranded on Mars and presumed dead by his crew. With meager supplies he must find a way to contact Earth, make oxygen and grow some food. Its very funny.This did feel a bit too long but in saying that I also can't think of any scenes that were unnecessary.Great special effects and finally a movie using CGI and green screens to enhance the movie not just BE the movie as is often the case these days, where movies forget about a story and just become special effect extravaganzas.It did get a bit over-the-top towards the end with Damon in his Ironman reminiscent suit but I went with it. Worth a watch.Oh, this is based on a book by Andy Weir."
" Globe Earth Propaganda
",2017-11-27 00:00:00,3,"The most unrealistic part of this movie, is not the fact that Matt Damon started a potato farm out of his own feces in space, but THE PREPOSTEROUS FACT THAT SPACE AND OTHER PLANETS EXIST!1! As a Christian Mom, I must tell you that the whole idea behind space, planets and even a globe earth is so unrealistic that I had to remove my 7 children from the cinema mid-way through and then perform an exorcism on them. I tried to contact Hollywood and demand this movie is removed from all cinemas within Christian governed nations but they wouldn't answer my e-mails or my calls. Alas I am here to try and convince all Christian citizens of the World, to avoid this movie like the plague. Also i'd like to inform you that NASA is a satanic organisation that throws arsenic in our water supply and that vaccines are made of sin. This movie proudly displays the ridiculous idea of space, which I am pretty sure is a myth (just like physics and sanitation). The only reason I am giving this movie is getting anything more than a 1/10 is because of Matt Damon. Check out my Matt Damon erotic fanfictions, if you want to make my Christian soul happy! :) Thank y'all. Vote Trump and don't forget that existing is a sin! Support West Ham United!"
" Full of cheesy quips
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,5,"I watched this initially at the cinema and gave it 7/10, on watching the 2nd time on Netflix I've decided 5/10 is generous. The cheesy quips are more noticeable the 2nd time around with a general feeling of 'Murica throughout the film, even after the help they receive from China the brave and clever 'Muricans prevail and the world applause's.The other major annoyance in the film for me was Donald Glover portraying Rich Purnell, a sort of 'on the spectrum/super clever' geek who is so clever he solved individually what teams of people cannot whilst being a second rate comedy actor with slapstick falling over and addressing the head of NASA like he's some random bloke he's struck up an interesting conversation withKristen Wiig was completely pointless, I can't actually raise enthusiasm to go more in depth of her character than thatNot a film I'd watch again"
" One of the best SF films
",2017-11-15 00:00:00,10,"I've been a big fan of the Martian, ever since I first read the book written by Andy Weir based on which the film was made. It is directed by Ridley Scott and features an outstanding cast such as Matt Damon in the role of astronaut Mark Watney and Jessica Chastain as Commander Melissa Lewis, the Ares III mission commander. Set in 2035, the action takes place on Mars, around Acidalia Planitia and its surroundings. The plot revolves around astronaut Mark Watney who, believed to be dead, was left on Mars by the rest of Ares III crew when they had to abort the mission due to a strong dust storm. And so, he sets out in an amazing race for survival, with limited resources of food and water, managing to do what no one would have thought that is possible to do on a lifeless planet. Under the direction of Ridley Scott, Damon gives a superb performance. As you'd expect, the film is thrilling and visually spectacular, with state-of-the-art visual effects. The script is surprisingly hilarious, which reflects on Damon's character, Watney, who tries to remain optimistic, despite knowing that he might not see the Earth again. Also, regarding the scientific information, the film, like the book, doesn't disappoint. It gives a wide range of accurate information from all the scientific branches. That said, for me it is the best science fiction film for many years, far more entertaining than the other science fiction films I've seen, and I would recommend it for anyone interested in science or looking for thrilling stories."
" A review of a gripping film
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,9,"Released in 2015, ""The Martian"" is a movie made by Ridley Scott, being a screen adaptation after the novel written by Andy Weir. It was nominated for 7 Oscars and it also won several awards at the Golden Globe. Even if it was filmed in many locations, the most unusual one ,for me, was Wadi Rum, Jordan The star of the movie is the well-known actor, Matt Damon, who manages to portray 'Martian' as a likable person and also to fill the two hours that remain after he is stranded on Mars. Being an adventure, drama, Sci-Fi film, ""The Martian"" tells the story of astronaut Mark Watney, who is presumed dead after a fierce storm and left behind by his crew on Mars. Surprising he has survived and finds himself stranded on the planet with only meagre supplies. Watney finds a way to signal to Earth that he is alive. NASA and a team of international scientists work tirelessly to bring him home, while his crewmates concurrently plot a daring rescue mission, a very risky one. All of them adventures are full of emotions and every scene in which one of them is risking his or her life makes you feel part of the movie and so becoming very gripping. For me, the biggest strength of this film is the actor who plays astronaut Mark Wathney, Matt Damon. Despite the fact that he is a gorgeous actor in general, he manages to play his role in an authentic mode, but also a little bit intriguing because of his way to act. But on the other hand, the story can be sometimes predictable and far-fetched, which is a huge weakness, from my point of view. Overall, in my not so humble opinion, I can say that ""The Martian"" is one of the most gripping films I have ever seen so far and I can recommend it to everyone who is interested in science, adventure and, why not in drama. I consider it can be seen by any category of age and occupation, but only a small part will understand the real message of the movie."
" Disappointing
",2017-11-06 00:00:00,1,"This film lacked tension and any strong interaction between the characters - such as they were. Quite soon into watching I felt that it was being strangled by political correctness. It is bland; it is beige; it is, quite simply, not compelling. Towards the end I completely lost interest in it, so little did I care about the outcome."
" Really enjoyed. Possible spoiler but a minor thing.
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,9,"Firstly, I watched this yesterday and the nearly 2 1/2 hours went past in a instant. Secondly, I have to agree with the previous review about the science but disagree about the one star they gave. My background is arts, not science but even I knew they were talking gibberish most of the time. Here's the minor spoiler. Damon's astronaut doubled the battery life on his ""rover"", the moon walker thing, despite being a botanist. So, a guy who grows plants can do that, but NASA can't? I didn't bother really with the science.What we do have, is a wonderful story about an astronaut left alone on Mars as he is presumed dead. Leaving aside his Stephen Hawking science, we see his determination to survive despite overwhelming odds. His tenacity and dry humour against insanity and slow death. It could be a one-man show for Damon and he totally steps up to the part. But, we also see the corporate/NASA element back on Earth with strong actors like Sean Bean and Jeff Daniels. Full credit to the actors playing Damon's crew as they return to Earth from Mars.This film doesn't have the obvious signature of Ridley Scott, he just lets his actors get on with it. Oh, the disco music is incongruous and very amusing.Ignore the science, enjoy the movie."
" Clunky Mess not deserving of any Oscar nominations
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,3,"Cant believe this was nominated for 7 Oscars. Matt Damon plays a scientist of sorts, in fact a botanist who after an accident is left on mars alone ,to survive he starts fertilising potatoes with his own excrement . What started brightly decent soon descended into a clunky mess which left me rolling my eyes. The scenes on earth with NASA were cringey and i was saying to myself no one talks like that in real life, it was like i was watching a Judd Apatow film ,Kristen Wiig has about 2 lines of dialogue but appears in the background in almost every scene looking on the verge of a stroke ,then there's Damon who had zero background to his character -are we led to believe that a scientist left on a distant planet thousands of miles away from home , doesn't suffer any adverse affects other than weight loss, doesn't feel any anger or anxiety or any other emotion, to cope he just makes corny jokes and listens to disco music Absurd premise with no depth or emotion and if wasn't directed by Ridley Scott it would of passed through the cinema without notice. Scott is the most overrated director going."
" Who made the decision to ""jazz it up""?
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,6,"It is clear that someone grabbed control of the script. Some producer who made the decision not to go with a slightly jazzier Apollo 13 and allow this film to be halfway believable.I was ready to give this a solid 8 or 9 stars. Despite the usual needless Hollywood visual embellishments, I was hanging in there, liking the way they were resisting making this film just another special effects exercise. But they couldn't do it, so right in the middle of the film they seem to invent ""Rich Parnell"". Young kid who comes up with hare-brained maneuver, and somehow gets into the office of the NASA director to make a stupid unrealistic demonstration that no one would put up with even from a legendary mathematician, much less a grunt astrophysicist no one knows. A maneuver that is totally unbelievable because it is preposterous.After that point, they continued to stretch our credulity until it broke. There were innumerable cases, but the final straw was when they had to honor political correctness and send a wisp of an woman, who had not trained for the maneuver, out on EVA when it would have been clear they needed the strongest man they could find. It's like Hollywood films have the equivalent of a Communist political officer -- ""The party wants it this way!""This kind of crap must sell, but it is sad. I would hope that the people who make this will realize they have relegated their movie to the scrap heap of history. ""2001 - A Space Odyssey"" is a classic because they didn't overreach. Likewise ""Apollo 13"". Those are films a director could be proud of. Instead, Ridley Scott will be remembered for laying a turd on the cinematic landscape."
" Generally very enjoyable
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,8,"I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy this film but I found myself getting drawn in right from the opening. The landscapes are epic and the cast are likable with Mat Damon playing his role particularly well. If you've seen Apollo 13 you know the story but somehow this is better even though it's complete fiction.So why did I only give it an 8/10 if I enjoyed it so much? It lost a couple of points for realism. Space / Mars is hard and will kill you in a myriad of different ways but the writers chose to use threats that wouldn't exist on Mars. The final rescue should have been kept simple, there was no need to go all gung-ho on it and it didn't fit with tone of the rest of the film."
" A great space movie
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,9,"A crew of six astronauts are in the middle of a sample collecting routine on Mars when they are taken by surprise by a massive storm. In their struggle to reach shelter, one of the members gets hit by debris and considered dead. The crew leaves for Earth only to later find out that their colleague is still alive, struggling in a desperate attempt to survive until a rescue mission is sent back to get him.It's a very emotional story of a man, stranded on Mars, which must survive way over his current resources allow, in a desperate hope that someone will hear his cry for help and come to save him. It's very interesting how he manages to overcome many difficulties in order to obtain food and, at the same time, also fix or upgrade his devices, vital for the many days which are to come. It's intriguing, sad, funny and also thrilling, making it addictive to watch most of the time.The main actor does an incredible job in describing the efforts of his character, making the whole plot very credible. As a downside, it is way too long for my taste, especially when the action is very static as it is in this film. You don't get bored but you want to see a bit faster what is the highly expected but predictable finale. It's a very good movie overall, but you have to be a bit patient in order to reach its end."
" Good Story line, lots of science, good effects.
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,7,"Story line is great honestly, I've read the book. The book its kinda confusing with all the science, however the movie has a great mix on explaining them. The effects are good as well. I didn't see any unrealistic thing, but very dangerous things to do on space. Its a good story line, excellent acting, but i wanted to see more acting on the crew part. In general, its a worth it movie to watch."
" Don't listen to the haters
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,10,"Never written a review in my life - read a few but never felt the need to do so myself until now!I've given this film 10 stars - apparently, according to some, that makes me an idiot, moron, clueless....etc, etc.This is a good film...I'll say that word again...'Film'. Is it completely scientifically accurate.....who cares? General moans include:1.Matt Damon isn't funny. Well he seems to be doing alright for himself as an unfunny actor. I find him very entertaining and I thought his performance was good and, even if I hadn't I'd like to think I would have stopped short of lambasting him.2.'It's unrealistic'...'It would never happen'...'That's not right' blah, blah, blah. As I said earlier...who care's? It's a film not a documentary. The fact that basement dwellers are up in arms because we don't actually have to sit and wait the 25 mins that it would take for any communication to get to and from is laughable. I'm glad we didn't have to 'wait it out'. 'He's a Botanist....what's he doing there'? Well...and I'm no expert but perhaps, given that NASA have sent a Mission to Mars...potentially with a view to 'one day colonizing said Planet' a botanist might be handy? The potato's....Could it actually work? No idea, don't care...not planning on being stranded on Mars to find out. God forbid that any future mission to Mars uses this film as a training guide because there's no mention at all of 'bacteria...ph levels...lighting levels'..zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...Good! Couldn't be happier that all that mumbo jumbo was left out. 3. 'There's no sense of actual loneliness'.....Maybe it should have been a hour and a half of Matt Damon weeping into the cameras? Sounds fun....cut to Matt kicking the dirt in boredom....now we're talking, much more entertaining. 4. 'The special effects aren't up to scratch'.....yawn, next! 5. 'It's not a true portrayal of human nature'....It seems that because the characters were actually nice to each other and didn't spend their time insulting each other it means it's a poor film.....Here's an idea..lighten up a bit, have some fun. If you want human nature, watch the news or one of the myriad of other films that portray it very well.There's so much more rubbish that has been written about this film but my stress vein is starting to throb in my forehead.... So I will simply say this: Why not watch it and see what you think? If you like it, great. If you don't well, not to worry eh?"
" One of My Favorite Movies
",2017-09-20 00:00:00,7,"The Martian is the one of my favorite movies. The movie tells the story about an astronaut - Mark Watney who lives on Mars.While Mark and his partners were working on Mars, suddenly there was a sandstorm. They needed to get on the spaceship to leave Mars, but Mark was hit by something. Although the commander wanted to save him, there was no time left, so they had to leave him behind. In the morning, Mark got into the HAB on Mars, he was hurt, so he stayed in the dome. He planted a lot of potatoes with some chemicals.At NASA, there wasn't anyone who knew Mark Watney was alive. Then one day, an employee saw something was moving on Mars. They knew that Mark was alive, so they started trying to contact him. They were successful, but Mark's partners didn't know that he was alive. So NASA's director Teddy Sanders told Mark's partners about it.NASA decided to launch a rocket to Mars and save Mark, but it exploded. The CASA wanted to help NASA, so they worked together. China had a rocket called Sun God, that could help them go to save Mark. Finally, they were able to save Mark. After returning to Earth, Mark stayed at NASA to teach new astronauts.This is a great and amazing movie. The story was very nice."
" Sadly, a movie that gets dated very quickly
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,6,"Dialogue is pretty much the downfall of this movie. It has fantastic cinematography and special effects. The cast is fantastic. However, as someone that went to a reputable university, unfortunately, the movie chose to give the characters in the movie the same sort of personality and culture that you'd see on a college campus. I've never worked for NASA or any engineering firm, so maybe it's realistic, I'm not sure. In a way, I thought it was a kid's movie. Mark Watney doesn't act like a grown-up, no one in NASA acts like a grown-up, it almost seems like the only mature people in the entire film are Jessica Chastain's character and Bill Pullman. Mark Watney's character is absolutely obnoxious. He was obnoxious in the book too, but the director should have had the discretion to change the character to be a bit more mature and human. At no point is suicide ever discussed by anyone in the film, nor does Mark ever come to terms with the fact no one may ever come back for him. He just acts like a little kid who has been left home alone, one big party. This is all made more convenient by the fact that he conveniently has no family or loved ones, despite being a Botany Ph.D. and an astronaut with a great job.I bought the blu-ray thinking it would be great for my collection, but this thing is going to get horrible real fast. It's most certainly not a classic, nor is it even something I'd show in school. It's a shame, because the film certainly could have been a lot better."
" Stranded on Mars
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,10,"Set in the not too distant future the Ares III mission to Mars has to abort there 31 Sol (Martian day) mission on Sol 18 when a storm hits their base and threatens to topple the rocket that will take them back to the Hermes, the craft that will take them back to Earth. As they run through the storm a piece of debris hits mission botanist Mark Watney. His colleagues try to find him but as his suit's telemetry suggests he is dead they are forced to leave without him. It soon emerges that he is not dead unfortunately he calculates that there won't be enough food left for him to survive till the next mission to Mars. Back on Earth everybody thinks he is dead until a satellite photograph shows that the Ares III site has changed so somebody must be there! Still at this point there is no way to contact him. Mark manages to grow potatoes for food and sets about retrieving a transmitter from a previous mission. With contact finally made they start discuss how he might be rescued. Time will be close and there will be setbacks.Fans of 'Hard Sci-Fi' should really enjoy this; the idea of manned mission to Mars might seem many years away the technology we see doesn't seem unrealistic and the story seemed plausible so much so that the film this most reminded me of was 'Apollo 13' which was of course based on a real life near disaster in space. The opening set up is effective and wastes little time in stranding Mark on Mars then we get down to the business of him trying to figure out how to survive. He encounters many problems which are resolved logically. Similarly the events on earth appear plausible as first those in charge want to avoid a PR disaster then work to rescue him when it becomes apparent that he is alive. The cast does a fine job. Matt Damen excels as Mark Watney managing to be entertaining even when the only talking he does for much of the time is direct to camera as he records a video diary. The rest of the cast, which includes many familiar faces also impresses. The Jordanian locations used look suitably barren to act as a substitute for Mars. While things are serious for the most part there are some good laughs as well; many provided by the fact that the only music Mark has is some disco taken to Mars my the mission commander this provides an excuse for some enjoyably incongruous back ground music which I rather enjoyed. Overall I really enjoyed this and would certainly recommend it even if you don't consider yourself a sci-fi fan."
" Mark's Adventure
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,9,"The movie ""The Martian"" is about an astronaut, Mark Watney who got stuck on Mars. It is a movie based on a novel by Andy Weir and the main character is played by Matt Damon. How did he survive after the accident? Let's find out.This movie began with a big sand storm. The Ares crew and Mark Watney were collecting samples of stones and dirt, when suddenly a sand storm came. Mark and the crew were separated by it. A metal stick stabbed Mark's body and the crew thought Mark was dead. To protect the other crew members, the commander forced the crew to abort the mission and Mark was left behind on Mars! The following day, when Mark woke up, he found he was alone on Mars. He wanted to survive on Mars; it's lucky that Mark is a botanist, he knew how to grow potatoes and make water by himself. He began to survive on this planet with very little water or food.One day, an engineer named Mindy Park found two satellite photos were different; the solar panels had been moved! The director Vincent Kapoor knew that Mark had survived. They wanted to save Mark's life, but the NASA director Teddy Sanders didn't agree. To rescue Mark, Mitch Henderson, who was the flight director of the Ares 3 Mission, used a special code to tell the Ares crew that Mark was still alive. Mitch wanted the crew to decide if they wanted to save Mark or not.In the end, the crew and Mark meet again. I felt so excited about their reunion. I liked the movie very much! The CG and story-line are very interesting, but most of all, the music - disco - is my favorite! I love it so much!"
" Something you should know about The Martian
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,6,"Mark Watney is a spaceman. One day, he was working with his partners on Mars when suddenly, a storm came but his partners didn't wait for him. He was stuck on a strange planet! What can he do? Will he survive? Let's find out!This movie started with an accident. A sand storm hit the Ares crew (a spaceman crew) while they were collecting samples. One of the crew members named Mark Watney was separated from his crew by the storm. The captain named Commander Lewis thought Mark was dead, so he was abandoned on Mars! When he woke up, he found that he was alone on Mars. He wanted to survive, so he tried to make water and he did it! Then he used the water to grow his food - potatoes.On Sol 54 (Mars Day), Mindy Park, a girl who works in NASA, found that something on Mars was moved. According to that, people knew Mark was still alive. Then people on Earth tried to save him. Through a series of search and rescue operations, they finally succeeded.Overall, I think it's a good movie but it is a little boring. Though it is quite dull, I really like the sentence, ""I want to fly like Iron Man!"" Maybe if the director added more funny parts like this it would be better."
" The man on Mars
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,8,Ridley Scott's The Martian was wonderfully realised on 3D for the big cinema screen. It probably will not come across well on the small screen.Astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is separated from his spacecraft and crew on a mission to Mars. Instead of panicking he overcomes the obstacles in his way by thinking outside of the box to survive as long as possible.When NASA find out that Mark is still alive his former crew mates turn around for a rescue mission.The film is essentially a lone survival film without the protagonist not exactly getting too lonely or crazy. There is the parallel story of NASA and other agencies working together on the rescue mission as Mark's predicament catches the public's attention.The problem with this type of movie and it happened with Gravity is that you can be blown away with special effects the first time round but it might lack rewatch value.
" several science mistakes in this movie
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,4,"Probably The Most Weird bit of all is the fact that Matt says that an explosion from a sort of water generator was caused by the excess OXYGEN that he breathed out: 1. You breath out co2 not oxygen 2. you would not cause an explosion by breathing a single breath of wind 3. How would like 10gs of wood chips burn for some like: 200 sols? he would need 10 kg instead of grams.Duct tape does not help in taping together a hole. It just doesn't. And I don't see any seals in that. all there is is a tarp and a few straps and duct tapes strips to seal it together. Mark uses duct tape to fix his spacesuit, attach a dangerous plutonium reactor, and to seal of a giant hole in the wall of the HAB, the base of the mission. The alarming fact is that it is 100% worrying when you hear the flapping sound of the tarp, and sending a person on a rocket ship with its nose cut off and replaced with a tarp is totally nonsensical. Overall, This is an okay movie but if you are one of those experts on film better not watch it. or if you are a scientist."
" Amazing
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,10,"This is a science fiction movie. The main character is Mark who is a astronaut. In order to investigate Mars, all members of the crew including Mark go to Mars. One day, sandstorm is happened. All members of the crew go back to the earth because everyone thinks that he is dead. However, he is alive. So, he takes advantage of having all knowledge to live and go back. He is a very tough whatever happens, so that I am very impressed with his way of life. So, please watch this movie."
" Overrated
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,5,"What this mostly is is watching Pimp Daddy Matt Damon eat. Scene after scene is him taking in his nourishment. There's not much to it. At least through the first half, which is all I watched from getting bored, when does he not have food in his mouth? Through all that, I shrugged and said, ""Ok...Does something ever HAPPEN in this movie?"""
" Thoroughly enjoyable, beautifully shot movie
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,9,"This was a great adaptation of the book, which I read and thoroughly enjoyed before the movie was announced. I've seen both the theatrical release and the extended version. The extended version just added a little more to the story, didn't really add much to the overall effect of the film, although there was a very funny, very inappropriate insult that was cut from the theater version to insure the PG-13 rating.Realistic sets and ship designs, and a great execution of the Mars surface. I thought Damon was perfect as Mark Watney, the right blend of intelligence and humor. The rest of the casting was excellent as well.I'm surprised and a little dismayed at some of the reviews who claim that the science in the film wasn't realistic. If you do a little research, you'll discover that all of the orbital mechanics as well as the challenges on the Martian surface are accurate, and that the complex series of steps needed to mount an expedition to Mars are realistic.I thought that the thought process of NASA and JPL were very realistic in how to handle the situation both scientifically and as a public relations disaster, and that the differing viewpoints were solid in their reasoning.As a film it was well constructed, good pacing, with moments of real emotion. I'll concede that Watney's ""Iron Man maneuver"" at the climax of the story was a little over the top, and probably would not have helped him.I truly took the movie as a testament to the better parts of humanity--our ability to think and reason and work together.So, don't go into it thinking this is a Hollywood edge of your seat disaster movie, or fanciful ""hyperspace"" adventure, it's a rational, thoughtful adventure."
" Excellent!! portrayal of life on mars
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,9,"This movie has shown exactly how it feels like living on mars, who ever watches this would never even thinks of going outer space & highly appreciates how lucky people on earth are, i never cared negative reviews, its great movie to watch, well directed with excellent screen play & cast"
" Enjoyable and Creative
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,9,"This film is quite enjoyable as there are many creative solutions presented by the main character Mark Watney (Matt Damon). The cinematography is fairly good and capture many aspects of space. There are some parts of the film that are not scientifically correct, but they are not glaring and do not take away from the film that much. The movies action pace is perfectly done as it changes speeds quite well. Shares a fair amount in common with Apollo 13, even though one is history and the other is fiction. The movie also did a good job of presenting the politics of NASA by showing the discussions had by the NASA director."
" ""In your face, Neil Armstrong!"" — The Martian.
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,8,"If it's the goal of great science fiction to boldly go where no man has gone before, Sir Ridley's ""The Martian"" might be a rare trodden turf, and typically Skeptical of science fiction movies dealing with space travel, yet. While it's no ""Interstellar,"" spinning off from Andy Weir's everyone-was-reading-it-on-the-bus bestseller, as much as it is a Robinson-Crusoe-in-space, it's a jet-black comedy about laughing in the face of mortality.This well-crafted film intricately embedded thought-provoking science, real controversial decisions pertaining to space, and futuristic science applications humans have yet to develop.""Mission Control"" monitoring, in the movie, the large TV screens plastered in every angle accurately captured the darkness, timing and adrenaline involved in finding a solution within a 3-5 minute span before potential explosions were to cause deaths. ""You do the math. You solve a problem. Then you solve the next. Then you can come home."" Running a mathematical analysis for 560 Sols straight, all by and for a nozzle botanist to stay alive simply on, hey Potatoes! - it takes a skilled team to find real-time solutions.There's a fictitious scene served to brilliantly re-ignite a real concern echoed in the Space community about launch safety. Rocket launches are risky, and successful rocket science is about proper certifications being met. In the movie, the NASA director orders that the return flight's thrust and weight certifications be skipped in order to save time in returning to Mars. His decision led to excessive vibrations and bending moments within the launch, which exploded the rocket into pieces mid-air. This scenario is real. That's almost bloody accurate!Chaos Theory is used for more than space travel. It predicts new technology, new weather systems, and even explains how the human brain's neurons fire together in Neuro-plasticity. Though in travel, humans have never been on a spacecraft that has flown to Mars partly because the ""gravitational assist"" effects on the human body are not fully understood yet.Don't forget it's been four decades since Sir Ridley Scott first made space travel so uniquely terrifying with ""Alien;"" here, he and Damon fill the film with fresh, deadpan pleasures, storm that kick- starts the narrative, what lingers are the crew's panicked faces, helmets aglow like Chinese lanterns. There is not always much adrenal drama: the default mode is problem- solving. But put The Martian next to its peers and it shines. In particular, between its last-man-standing plot and the presence of both Damon and Jessica Chastain, the overlaps with Christopher Nolan's Interstellar are downright curious. And The Martian is nimble everywhere Nolan's film galumphed; it's a movie in which the greatness of the human spirit meets the wonder of gaffer tape. Furthermore, this must be a new frontier to explore, if ""The Martian"" is put in contrast to Britain's spectacular cinema landmarks: ""Moon"" to ""Gravity"" to ""Interstellar"" it'll look like a 70's disco classic remix album: While it is a great science fiction film that intricately embeds thought-provoking science applications humans have yet to develop, you'd hardly call it a Scott 'Masterpiece' stretching itself, or the boundaries of where an effects blockbuster can take us. It's less a space odyssey than this genre's equivalent of a high-climbing log flume that's also very enjoyable to watch.""They say that once you grow crops somewhere, you officially Colonised it. So, technically, I Colonised MARS. In your face, Neil Armstrong!"" — Mark Watney a.k.a ""The Martian"" a.k.a ""the Greatest Space Pirate—Botanist"" to ever step foot on the ""RED Planet: MARS,"" and COLONISE it by growing fresh—POTATOES, harvesting his own S%it!"
" A hit by Ridley Scott!
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,10,"Outstanding performance by Matt Damon, Jessica Chastain, Kristen Wiig, and Kate Mara, teamed up with Ridley Scott's directing and stunning cinematography makes this film a must see!I also feel this one was one of my favorite Matt Damon performances, and he portrayed his character perfectly - with a side dish of humor!All around great flick that could have not been produced any better!A perfect 10/10 from me!"
" What an awesome movie about the human spirit of survival!
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,10,"First of all I don't get why there are so many bad reviews about this movie, I think the plot is sound with strong characters and performances all round! I found myself enjoying this movie from the opening sequence to the credits, it makes sense from a scientific and technical point of view whilst maintaining an engaging plot with likable characters, interesting story and even has a good mix of humor thrown in for flavor.Everything from the crew abandoning their crew mate after he is given up for dead and then the struggle of the lone survivor having to use the resources he has at hand to survive in a completely hostile environment really got me into this film; I found myself enjoying their successes and wondering what was going to happen at other times.I recommend this movie to anyone, it will entertain you while keeping your interest; I didn't really find myself at any time bored during this film."
" Whoring out to China
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,3,"This was a great sci-fi movie that has all the ingredients I'd ever want. And then came the China involvement in the rescue effort.Get used to it. Hollywood studios have begun the process of COMPLETELY altering their core story line to make films more attractive to the gargantuan Chinese viewer base. The Chinese element in this film crashes into the core story line so hard and with such utter lack of congruence that it is beyond a distraction, it's just a suspension-of-disbelief buster. Sure, the Chinese have a just-barely viable space program, NOTHING compared to Japan, Russia, the US, France, England.. but hey, they're riding to the rescue in this film.Hollywood, fork off."
" Well orchestrated and balanced for a wide appeal
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,9,"There's so much that works in this motion picture you have to hand the biggest laurel wreath to the great Ridley Scott - director extraordinaire - top of the podium. Then next of prominence is the charisma of Matt Damon, even though he's not given a great deal to work with and who's head's inside a goldfish bowl half the time - but hey that's all in a great actor's stride. Damon's like the plucky astronaut - he manages his lengthy confinement with a cocky smile. There's a suite of good actors supporting - Jessica Chastain is great as the sinewy redheaded mission commander, there a side-line in pathos and earthiness from the great Yorkshireman Sean Bean. I've just seen him doing a great working class parish priest in the drama Broken - he's doing similar here as a lonely voice of conscience. There's the energy of Michael Peña, vulnerability of boss Jeff Daniels, anyway lots of talent. There's funky music that works perfectly. The story is science-based and quite technical and the visual effects stunning so it's got a realism and credibility to it. It's just short of the 10/10 I just gave The Informants! where Matt Daman was given more of a blank cheque to strut his stuff. Ultimately there's just a tad of a lack of a certain depth and drama, a gap in a certain something that was perhaps sacrificed for that overall broadly entertaining package. It's no Tarkovsky's Solaris and no existentialist masterpiece, but its a darn-well executed sci-fi yarn that covers a fair demographic spread of appeal. It's one to recommend to anyone even vaguely interested in space and technology, and well, who isn't?"
" Apollo 13 remake
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,6,"Just another feel-good Hollywood ""We are Americans, we can do anything if we set our mind to it"" movie. Basically a remake of Apollo 13 with updated CGI, the only difference is Apollo 13 were at least based on a true story. The landscape is beautiful though, if you want to spend 2+ hours on just that. Not much acting to speak of. Oh by the way, I heard they added Chinese contributions to the rescue mission so that the movie can make it to that lucrative market."
" Matt on Mars
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,7,"Okay, I'll admit it – I'm not a huge Matt Damon fan. I can't get that impression of him from 'Team America: World Police' out of my head (if you've seen the film you'll know the one I mean!). Therefore, when I heard that 'The Martian' was about him being an astronaut stranded on Mars, my initial reaction was oh, well, never mind. However, after watching the film, I'm still no real convert for Matt himself, but I can say that the film is actually pretty good.It's been getting quite a lot of praise heaped upon it and, although I did enjoy it, I'd hardly liken it to the classic that some people are hailing it as. As I've said, Matt Damon is part of the first manned mission to Mars and, when a freak sandstorm hits, his crew are forced to perform an emergency evacuation, stranding him there in the process. I knew that going into the film and actually expected it to be only about Matt Damon, hardly ever featuring anyone else. I was pleased to say that the scenes on the red planet are constantly interspersed with those back on Earth as the rest of the world (well, Nasa mainly) is tasked with the solution to finding him a way back home. But, ultimately, it's Matt's show and it's mainly about him. And, I'm pleased to say he comes across as a likable guy to be stuck on – technically – an alien planet with (at least from an audience's perspective anyway!).So, he goes about his business doing his best to survive with the limited resources he has to hand. It's nice to see a film where it's actually quite dramatic without the need for all those other – apparent – nasties that Mars has spawned. Matt Damon's life is difficult enough staying warm, without worrying about green bug-headed aliens in flying saucers, ghosts who possess your body and force you to self-mutilate, or borderline fascist corporate men in suits who want to keep the air for themselves in order to stay in power.I should probably mention that it's directed by Ridley Scott who, when he's not doing weird things to the 'Alien' franchise, still has it when it comes to directing epic landscapes and beautiful scenery. Also, it's originally based on a book of the same name; I haven't read that (I barely have time to watch a two hours film, let alone read words!) so I can't really comment on how faithful this adaptation really is.It's hard to say too much more about this film. It's a nicely-simply affair and the threat comes from the harsh environment Matt Damon is stranded in, rather than the afore-mentioned other filmic nasties from Mars. Okay, so there's a little conflict with the other characters back on Earth with how they deal with the 'political' fallout that stems from effectively blasting off from orbit and not bothering to check whether one of your people was still planting potatoes! Plus, when I saw the run-time was over two hours I did wonder whether it would hold my attention and I'm pleased to say that it did. I'd definitely watch this again, maybe not soon, but it's worth a second watch at some point."
" Humorous and Interesting
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,8,"This movie was different from what I expected from watching all the other futuristic space-sci-fi movies. I would say it is more realistic than other space movies, but still, its science fiction. This movie does focus more on the humanly aspects of survival and isolation than technical and scientific aspects. And this also does make the plot a little contrived and the heroic behavior of the characters and the happy ending is pretty predictable. (Although its also allows it to have some amusing scenes that I enjoyed.) However, it is entertaining to see how he survives in such harsh conditions of the huge planet of mars, and how the contact with another human lets his life go on. This movie also illustrates the importance of a single human life. The visuals of this movie is very clean and grand like all futuristic movies, and it's fun to see the huge spaceships and the planet Mars."
" Ingenuity as a new trait of hero
",2017-06-15 00:00:00,8,"I didn't read the book, but the film is pretty good, I think/ I enjoy the main idea of the film about ingenuity of the human mind and that all things can be repaired by reinforced tape (it is true, I checked it in my own experience). I suppose that the acting is not excellent but it is not so important for such type of films. I think this film is one of the best sci-fi films the recent years, however it has some rude mistakes in physics."
" Missed the mark completely
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,2,"Man, this movie made me angry! It attempts to make the audience feel sorry for Matt Damon's character, but all I could think of was what a selfish bastard he is. He risks the lives of his former crew mates, makes them stay in space more than a year longer than they should have, and I don't even want to think of the financial costs, and all because that egoistic turd decided he wanted to stay alive (and then takes all the credit himself for being alive in the end). If he would have thought about anyone else than himself he would have killed himself! Some of his crew mates had families, for crying out loud, which he obviously did not care one bit about! So the failure of this movie is clearly that the message of hope, that one should never give up (""solve one problem and then the next"" and etc.) is overshadowed by the fact that the main character is a stubborn, selfish bastard who obviously valued his life above those of others."
" Golden Globe for comedy, comedians miscast in serious roles. ABBA soundtrack. Contrived to make money. Awful, awful.
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,1,"This movie may have been initially popular, but it will fade away. To better imagine being on Mars I had to mute the sound to imagine Watney breathing in his space suit whilst he worked, You do get the impression of being on Mars but this is not sustained because of the comedic overtones and stupendous miscasting. I imagined another version being released in the future - a true space drama- deleting the wisecracks, replacing the soundtrack, and reinforcing the success factors such as the sense of isolation, the science, and the fear. But that's not going to happen. People forget this movie is a comedy, yet it is thoroughly unfunny, but it did win a Golden Globe for comedy. Touché from the accountants! Audiences do love an optimistic fantasy depicting triumph over adversity. And what fantasy! The sandstorm that stranded Watney would be no more fierce than being pelted by talcum powder given Mars thin atmosphere. The storm would barely raise a flag. And then there is Watney. Perpetual optimist, says he's a botanist, but botanists are not farmers nor gardeners. The garden he creates is ridiculous, too shallow with no drainage, and the crop yield fantastical (see one of the reviews below which explores this in detail). Watney doesn't suffer much. He is playful, always strong, optimistic, jovial, confident. I don't see him triumphing over adversity."
" Great, just flat out great!
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,8,"Ridley Scott returns to the science-fiction genre based on the book by Andy Weir about a man who gets stranded on Mars and must survive for as long as he can. This story might feel like a Cast Away and Apollo 13 hybrid but its execution makes The Martian feel absolutely refreshing and funny. The Martian has humor and charm that brings a kind of levity and watchability to a film that would otherwise feel emotionally exhausting to watch. The film features an incredibly strong performance by Matt Damon as well as the rest of the cast. Visual effects are top notch and cinematography is a wonder to behold. The Martian is groundbreaking in its technical and storytelling achievements and is overall paced nearly perfectly. There are a few 3rd act inconsistencies but these feel minor since the 1st and 3rd act are incredibly strong. Despite the story probably feeling familiar and a few pacing issues, The Martian is an excellent film that will attract casual movie goers and critical audiences alike. It's heartfelt, funny, and wonderfully directed. This is another highly recommended film from 2015."
" so boring
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,5,lot of people love sci fi movie including me and this movie many people loved it and can't understand why from my opinion this is weak sci fi movie this movie is so boring and very slow can't remember any sci fi movie make me so boring like this movie and matt Damon is good actor but his performance in this movie was very poor his worst by far and they way they saved him by very stupid and kind of joke bad joke this is my opinion
" Boring and Beautiful
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,7,"The Martian captured the fears and dangers of every space adventure while keeping the tone light-hearted and humorous. At times almost too funny, the drama could never be fully embraced by the audience but still acknowledged in the worst moments. The Martian also managed to involve the crew's personal lives without pulling emotion away from Watney. The bureaucratic conversations were at times stale but mostly understandably necessary. Matt Damon carried his scenes beautifully with his support staff of disco music and potatoes, enough so that I, at times, missed him and his sarcastic self- deprecation in other scenes that were easily forgettable. Wiig's character, though, was unnecessary and superficial, spending her time making blatantly obvious statements rather than doing any actual work to appease the public or bring Watney home. She was almost pathetic when compared to other, much stronger, female characters. There was also the bit with Glover's character that was dragged on way longer than it needed to be. Getting to the point faster wouldn't have taken away any of the story in this case. Also, that part of the story line seemed completely unrealistic in terms of the extent Glover's character had to explain his idea for it to make sense to the others in the room and the stealth that had to occur for it to happen. Sometimes, it was like the filmmakers felt obligated to make a space movie longer than two hours because most are. In the end, the story was almost too predictable and a bit more surprise would've been appreciated but the action scenes were enough to tide me over in terms of dramatic content. However, it was a space movie that effectively used math and science without oversimplifying or having to drone on and on to explain. Also, it was a gorgeous movie. The Mars depicted in this movie was not the most scientifically accurate, considering the sandstorm that occurred in the beginning, but it was an awfully pretty sight. Most space movies are easily given good notes for their cinematography because it's difficult to go wrong with twinkling stars and sweeping shots of floating spaceships but The Martian deserves special kudos for its work."
" Nothing compared to the book.
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,7,"Don't get me wrong, this movie is extraordinarily good. But, it was NOTHING compared to the book. Watney did not get as much conflict in this movie as he did from the book. The movie is less intelligent (not that it's necessarily a bad thing), but overall the movie is good, but not even in the same world of how good the book is."
" Embarrassingly failed effort
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,1,"This film lacks all those quintessential qualities that a seasoned film-goer is entitled to expect from a science fiction film directed by one of the biggest legends of the genre: suspense, innovative characters and props and compelling music. Along with the last- mentioned shortcoming, the frivolous and vapid dialogue is an awkward mismatch with the overall theme of the film. Likewise, there are too many major inconsistencies to dismiss in the story line. Simply put, this effort deserves to be forgotten."
" Food crops
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,7,"Warning...food supplies/survival assessment. It's essential to his survival, but when assessing his potato crop, there is no way he could have reaped 400 potato on the first harvest. Also, when they showed shots of his potato crop, there are way too many plants based on what he started with. The bag looked like it had 12...2 potatoes each for a crew of 6, or 12, and 48 plants. If successfully grown, 4 large potatoes from each plant, and smaller ones to replant would give him 194 from first harvest...OR, Take the Thanksgiving meal...at best, 3 potatoes each times six people would give 18 potatoes. He was quartering them...that would give him about 72 max. The next crop would be bigger, as he used several small potatoes from each plant, so ideally, 72 x 4, or 288 plants. It took roughly 35 'Sol's' to grow and then harvest, so it would still take awhile for him to produce 400 potatoes to eat. He'd need to have 3 or more successful harvests to get enough to last the 3 years needed before the Ares IV mission. Important for the movie, but a bit impossible in real life. Also, potatoes need at least 2 feet of dirt to grow, and he only had a foot or so...it would matter if that last crop was still edible after the surface plants died...since they were underground, they might have survived, which would have given him about 6-8 from each plant, small and large. He should have tried to grown more...somehow, even if it was a smaller operation...and holding a breathable atmosphere in the HAB behind tarps is another question."
" Review of The Martian
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,8,"Matt Damon, the star in The Martian, took the main role of the movie and with his humor and sarcasm, created one of the most thought-provoking science films of the century. Even as a person who normally finds the idea of space a bit boring, the amount of science applications in the movie made it an absolute fascination to watch. When the astronauts experience a storm on Mars and are forced to leave because their base is threatened, they have to leave Mark Watney (Matt Damon) behind with the thought that he was killed by flying debris. When Watney wakes later, with metal impaled in his stomach, he finds himself completely alone on the planet, with minimum food, no way to communicate with Earth and about every possible thing that could be wrong with being alone on a planet. Watney figures out that he needs to grow food by using his and the others excrement's as a fertilizer and while the idea of it is absolutely disgusting, it gives way for all things that science can do. Watney's fight to get off the planet and back home alive and in one piece, is inspiring and shows all that science can do. The next to impossible fight to be able to communicate with Earth shows just what kinda limits can be broken with faith and science. About every possible thing that could go wrong with Watney's mission does exactly that. When his pod blew, which held his food and necessities, it seemed like the absolute end for Watney. His humor even when death was right around the corner made the edge of your seat a permanent place to sit and hope for the best. The constant and tireless work of the scientists and NASA members to try and get Watney home is inspiring not only to an audience but also to all of science."
" Why you should take time to see ""The Martian""
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,9,"""Everywhere I go I'm the first. It's a strange feeling. Step outside the rover, first guy to be there. Climb that hill, first guy to do that. Four and a half billion years, nobody here. And nowme."" - Mark Watney, ""The Martian""Imagine you're the first person to be alone on an entire planet. You're in a NASA exploration habitat that was built to last for 31 days. Your food supply is limited. If the oxygenator breaks, you'll suffocate. If the water reclaimer breaks, you'll die of thirst. If the habitat is breached, you'll implode. What do you do? How do you survive? Is it possible to make it back home? For astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon), dying is not an option. You'd think a story about one man's fight for survival on a planet several million years away from Earth would be bleak, but this return to form for director Ridley Scott is anything but. ""The Martian"" is one of the funniest movies I have seen all year, largely due to Drew Goddard's adapted screenplay and Damon's perfect execution of the sarcastic spaceman Mark Watney.Each time something goes wrong, Watney delivers a line that showcases his optimism and comedic nature. One of my favorite lines comes a little over halfway into the movie, when Watney is forced to ration his food into smaller portions. As he eats a piece of meat the size of a Lego block and half of a red potato, he stares at the camera blankly and says: ""It's been seven days since I ran out of ketchup.""While humorous moments like this are sprinkled throughout the film, Damon also captures the underlying despair and loneliness felt by Watney, and his desire to get back home. The scene that hooked me comes right after Watney is marooned on the red planet. As a massive dust storm rages outside of the habitat, a defeated Watney looks through some of the belongings his crew left behind. Staring off into the darkness, he confidently mutters, ""I'm not gonna die here."" Damon's performance is complimented by those of a large supporting cast consisting of Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Michael Pena, Kate Mara, Kristen Wiig, Sebastian Stan, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Sean Bean, who play members of Watney's crew and the NASA men and women trying to get him home.When Watney says, ""Mars will come to fear my botany powers,"" you believe him. His scientific wit is as entertaining as his humor, and you're for rooting for Watney each step of the way. You cheer with each success, and empathize with each failure. Ridley Scott and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski bring the desolate wasteland of Mars to life. Scott and Wolski create beauty from the barren world, and with each shot, the vast desert further contributes to the sense of isolation you feel while sitting in the theater.""The Martian"" stands among Ridley Scott's best work, and Matt Damon provides one of his greatest performances. The scientific wonder the film evokes transcends both of their contributions however, and I am excited to see where we as humans progress in the coming years. With several Mars-based projects currently being pursued by NASA as well as advancing technological developments, the future looks bright. Hopefully in our lifetime we will have the chance to witness history. Mars colonists will be able to say with a smile, ""In your face Neil Armstrong."""
" Martian, to Space Pirate, to Iron Man.
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,7,"Some awesome one liners, steady pace, satisfactory direction, good scoring and a wonderful cast, The Martian is an entertaining space odyssey that does a fine job at making it's viewer feel the isolation Mark is going through, which is an important part of the story - however, I do feel that it could've still been done better.All that Mark accomplished, though at many points seemed amazing, at other parts it seemed a little too easy, especially his journey to the MAV, but again, overall, his struggle, panic and isolation was well captured for the most part.Some characters were a little too under used, and other characters perhaps felt kind of useless or rather, not too necessary, but on the flip side, it felt like an accurate depiction of how it actually is, and realism in this type of film, is always a good thing, because the intent is to be more than just entertainment if possible... If possible, the intent is, possibility.The Martian is more than a 7, but less than an 8, so a 7.5/10 it'll be from me, for the fastest space pirate in the history of space travel... in a convertible."
" 80s music video off heart radio ew
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,7,"From a space film I always expect top notch music. I would say that this film is a feel good movie, rather than a typical space film. The music used feels out of place and makes the whole film very cheesy. The humour would have been good enough without the music. It's like an 80s music video. This film is directed at the older generation with songs that are already overplayed enough. Soundtrack ripped straight off heart radio. The OST is good (Harry Gregson-Williams is my favourite composer) but add in the cheesy 'waterloo' and all is lost. As for the story line, it's engrossing with a good balance of tension and humour, and even a little bit of blood thrown in to make you wince. Good, but could be so much better if they had sacrificed the approval of 50 year old women."
" Does not follow the laws of physics, but still an amazing movie/story!
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie! I understand that the whole premise of what this movie is based on is practically impossible, but that's just it...it's a story! This is not a documentary!! This is purely a story showing what one man did to survive on Mars and it is a fictional story!!I loved this movie because of what he did to survive. He solved all of these problems on his own until he reestablish communication with NASA. And even after establishing communication with NASA he sometimes ignored them, he had fantastic jokes and the connection that they portrayed with his crew mates was fantastic. There are some questions that I've seen people posting in the reviews like: ""... growing a potato over soil not tested fertilized with astronauts ""poo""... what about bacteria? ... why he had potatoes in a Martian station?""...To answer these questions: (I believe) it's mentioned in the movie however I have read the book multiple times so I might be getting that mixed up but it is at least mentioned in the book. 1)He's the only freaking astronaut on the planet hence his ""poo"" bacteria has already come out of him so it's not going to get him sick. 2) he had potatoes that were not the normal way astronauts would eat food in space because they were (supposed to be) there over Thanksgiving. So NASA thought it would be a great morale booster to have them eat an actual Thanksgiving dinner (or close to it). This person has three others listed, but again if you actually read the book that this movie is based off of it answer all of these questions. Just because you don't like the movie does not mean that it's bad it means it's a movie so they don't have as much time to go into detail as the book does. Do you say that Lord of the rings and the hobbit were not as good because they didn't explain some things? No, you understand it's a movie (and a long one already) and that there are going to be things left out. Bottom line that I have to say about this is: I think it's a fantastic movie. There are obviously mistakes but your average person is not going to notice them because they're not gonna know that there physically impossible or that NASA doesn't run a specific way. If you're unsure after reading my and others reviews that may be similar or very different my advice is to rent it if possible or borrow it from someone. Or if you're still not sure just read the book it's better anyways!!P.S. The story is set in the future therefore it implies that things have changed maybe not significantly but enough to be a change from what is currently happening now."
" Good Sci-Fi Flick!
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,7,"Matt Damon and Jeff Daniels star in Ridley Scott's 2015 sci-fi film based on the novel. This focuses on Mark Watney, an astronaut/botanist who gets stranded on Mars after an accident occurs during a mission and he's presumed dead. Mark uses his mathematical and scientific skills to survive as well as communicate with Earth. Soon, the people around the world learn he's alive and scientific experts try endlessly to rescue him using their skills. Daniels (Dumb & Dumber) plays Ted Sanders, the Head of NASA and Jessica Chastain (Interstellar), Kristen Wiig (Bridesmaids) and Sean Bean (Goldeneye) co-star. This is a good sci-fi flick that sort of shares a similarity with ""Cast Away"" with dramatic, humorous and tense moments. Damon is great in it and the visuals are amazing. I recommend this."
" Change & Loneliness
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,9,"Like Passengers or Gravity, The Marcian is a story about loneliness and change, two mutually dependent realities that feed each other. Thus, when the relation of man to his environment changes, he discovers intrinsic elements of the human condition - solitude, authenticity, individuality - which he would otherwise not have been able to discover; And when these have been discovered, that is, when change has shown man his intrinsic reality, he must be able to feel sure to resist change, to adapt, since the same change has given him enough spiritual tools to survive, to adapt . In other words, in the face of change, man perfects his self-consciousness to adapt. The history of humanity? Maybe"
" Lost in Space.
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,2,"For a director of the stature of Ridley Scott to allow his prodigious talents to be squandered in such a way is a crime. Is this the same man who brought us ""Alien""?? It's as though he HAD to produce a ""summer blockbuster"" to satisfy his corporate masters, at OUR expense. This movie is nothing but a hodgepodge of clips, gags, and dialogue that he felt necessary to cannabalize from not only his own films, but every, single science fiction piece of CGI trash on the market, just to produce a ""marketable product,"" even rescuing a dour-faced Jeff Daniels from unemployment in order to scowl throughout this entire, useless excuse for a scifi epic. It was as though Scott watched endless reruns of an equally tedious ""Gravity"" by which to steal yet MORE ideas and plot points so unbelievably ludicrous as to beggar the imagination. But what is even more obvious is Scott's ripping off Bruce Dern's scifi classic, ""Silent Running, in 1972, which was the first to explore the ""Farmer in Space"" theme, 45-years earlier. The only difference is, he did it better. Perhaps a pre-teen could believe this fabricated piece of space junk, but certainly no discerning adult."
" Really good sci-fi movie. Would highly recommend.

All the supporting cast do good from Michael Pena to Sean Bean to Jeff Daniels. All of the supporting characters, even lesser seen crew members, are interesting and actually have some depth to them.4. I adore the way the movie is told via the progression of Sols.

" ""Apollo 13"" Meets ""Interstellar""But Not Quite As Good As Either
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,7,"""The Martian"" is a solid movie. It has an interesting plot, some good character development, and (in a complete departure from most Ridley Scott films) contains a very hopeful, at times even light-hearted tone. Most people viewing this will find it a very enjoyable experience all-around.Here is the problem, though: About a year ago, ""Interstellar"" was made by Christopher Nolan. It shares many similar character types and themes with ""The Martian""but manages to beat it in nearly every single area. So, I have to say that it was a little weird seeing this movie and thinking that not only it wasn't as good as ""Interstellar"", but now it is chronologically second-fiddle too.For a basic plot summary, ""The Martian"" primarily tells the story of a member of the Aries III crew exploring Mars sometime in Earth's future. A violent windstorm picks up and astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is flung off into the eye of the storm and presumed dead, his fellow crewmates having to make a tough decision and a quick getaway. Due to some incredible luck, however, Watney is most certainly not deadjust stranded on Mars with few supplies and not enough food to last until any sort of retrieval mission can be furnished. The catch? Watney is a scientist (a botanist, to be exact), and must tap into all of his ingenuity and wits in order to survive until NASA can pick him up again.Like I said, ""The Martian"" is a pretty good movie when looked at with tunnel-vision. It has all the right ingredients for a great sci-fi drama, and those ingredients do indeed gel together to form an entertaining final product. It has some high-concept themes, impressive visuals, and that sense of gravitas befitting films like ""Apollo 13"". Damon turns in a great performance, and his scenes are the highlight of the entire experience (had the movie focused on him even more exclusively, I probably would have liked it even better!).There are indeed two major problems that keep this film from being a classic sci-fi adventure, though:1. The casting besides Damon is very poor. Jeff Daniels is terrible as the head of NASA, as is Kristen Wiig in a similar corporate role, and Jessica Chastain's character is inexplicably under- utilized. As such, the scenes where Damon isn't front-and-center really drag the fun to a halt.2. Maybe this isn't 100% fair, but it still stands that this movie can't really hold a candle to Nolan's masterful ""Interstellar"", and that turned into kind of a problem during the viewing experience. I mean, think of it this way: A film featuring Chastain, Damon, space travel, space anomalies, and all set in a very hopeful tone. Where have you seen that movie before? I know that ""The Martian"" is based on a book and thus it is difficult to scream ""plagiarism"" too loud, but having not read the book I really don't know how closely it was followed. To me, then, this sure seemed like an opportunity to capitalize on the success by using the same general themes of the previous ""Interstellar"".Bottom line: Had I seen this movie a year or so ago, I may have liked it considerably more. However, once one has seen movies like ""Interstellar"" before it, it kind of feels old-hat. Not a bad movie by any means (and hence the four-star rating), but also not all that close to being one that will be remembered for years, either."
" A whole movie...
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,3,"consisting of sounds from Matt Damon eating.I really don't get it why so many people consider this an intelligent movie, whether that says something about my intelligence or the movie is up to you.I found the movie lacking, and the acting of Matt Damon annoying. Especially the constant sound of him eating something, and I mean CONSTANTLY! Seriously, close your mouth when eating...I have nothing positive to say about this movie, boring story, bad acting, way too hyped and an utter waste of time.Watch the Bourne movies instead, if you want some Matt Damon action. If you're looking for sci-fi, there are a lot of much better movies out there!"
" Farming ... in Space!
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,8,"A lot of sci-fi is about what's possible, but The Martian is the rarer sci-fi film about what's probable. This is a movie not about fancy effects but about *science.* It's a movie about a smart guy stranded on an alien planet who has to use his considerable knowledge to solve life- or-death problems. The movie makes its science quite interesting; I found myself totally invested in the problems of growing potatoes on Mars or getting a rover to go further than it's supposed to.While Matt Damon is doing his science, a bunch of people on earth are doing their science, and it's just as fascinating. While there are no shootouts or romances, there is some suspense and a good deal of humor, as well as a bit less concern about the probable versus the possible towards the end. When I saw the trailer for this, it didn't interest me; I really only watched it because my girlfriend wanted to (she liked the trailer). But this is a first-rate movie."
" In Space no One Can Hear You Scream
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,9,"This movie is a triumph on almost every level; script, acting, directing, cinematography and special effects are all top notch. It's one of Ridley Scott's best films in years as well as a career high performance from Matt Damon who commands the screen and bring so much charisma and a surprising amount of humor to his character. The story revolves around an astronaut being stuck on Mars and having to fight to stay alive while NASA works to bring him home. The 2 1/2 hour running time goes by almost too fast as the film is full of scenes of intensity, thrills but most of all plenty of laughs. It's an all round crowd pleaser the whole family should enjoy."
" Keep Him There
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,4,"At one point in The Martian, Matt Damon's character mentions that he hasn't bathed in quite a while. My wife turned to me and said, ""He must stink!"" I replied, ""Almost as much as this movie.""I've seen worst movies to be sure. But I would have expected more from director Ridley Scott and certainly a great deal more from one of the better known planets in our solar system.Damon plays astro-botanist and electromechanical whiz Mark Whatney. This guy makes McGyver look like a five-year-old dealing with an incomplete Tinker Toy set.As far as the acting and directing go, I suspect that Mr. Scott, while screen testing Jessica Chastain, said something to the effect of, ""Yes! That's it! That's the kind of acting I want in this film! I want everyone to simper and smirk and give me that ""can-do"" attitude. We'll do over two hours of just that! As well, we'll pepper the film with crummy pop music from the seventies. And we'll have none of that four-letter language that I've used in my superior films such as American Gangster. This is going to be a movie that the whole family can suffer through!""The effects are great. And although I haven't been there yet, the Mars landscape looks real enough. But this is typically overblown Hollywood schmaltz (and you just KNOW how it's going to end).I should finally mention another notable scene in this film where Damon is sitting in his Martian abode watching a video of a Happy Days episode. It raises the question, ""Would I rather be 225 million kilometers away on a cold and barren planet watching Happy Days, or subject myself to another movie like The Martian in the comfort of my living room?""Tough call."
" Riveting and Inspiring
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,10,"In this film, the crew of a Mars expedition mistakenly believes that a member of their crew is dead and leaves him behind on the surface of Mars. The marooned astronaut must find a way to let people on Earth know that he is still alive. With limited resources, he is forced to use his ingenuity to find a way to survive long enough to be rescued.This film was reported to have been one of the most scientifically accurate space dramas ever created. Although the depiction of the Martian storm was exaggerated for dramatic effect, the means by which the stranded astronaut survived were based on research. The only question is whether or not an astronaut would have the knowledge to do all of those things without communications with Earth.This film was riveting from start to finish. The notion of an astronaut being able to change his own fortunes through unrelenting hard work was inspiring. The visuals of the Martian setting gave movie goers a realistic feel for what it would be like to be on Mars. The 1970's music used in the film captured the mood of the various scenes perfectly. At times, the movie was uplifting and exhilarating. This was easily one of the best Mars exploration dramas ever made. This was one film which should not be missed. It is highly recommended!"
" More Hollywood Garbage
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,1,"I stopped watching after Matt Damon said, ""In the face of overwhelming odds, I'm left with only one option: I'm gonna have to science the $hit out of this."" I wouldn't be surprised if NASA scientists and the ghost of Carl Sagan weren't collectively cringing after hearing this horrible drivel. Do they think this is clever writing, or are they just too lazy to write something good? Why don't they just have the actors say, ""Yada yada yada, rocket propulsion, blah blah blah, Mars, something, something, science...""I've said it before: I think Hollywood should just give up all pretense and film one of their over-paid, self-important ""actors"" to sit on a toilet for 2 hours. It couldn't be any worse than this movie or most of the other garbage they keep churning out in order to separate us peasants from our hard-earned money."
" Mars is my world
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"I have seen some reviewers who claimed that this movie hadn't live up to their hope. However, as for me, I enjoyed it pretty much. When I was a kid, the book I loved most was ""Robinson Crusoe""(until now is still). And I love to play video games like ""Ark: Survival Evolved"", ""Don't Starve"" and other survival types. Therefore, this movie just satisfied my fantasy in every way. I can never deny that I am afraid of solitude, but if I can create a world of mine just Robinson and Watney, things may be different. In spite of many physical ignorance, I suppose it is a good piece. Oh, forget to say, when Watney first tempted to burn the hydrogen and was blew up by himself, I burst into laughter."
