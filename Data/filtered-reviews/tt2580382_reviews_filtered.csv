" GROSS , Cringe AND NONSENSICAL
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,1,"How this movie got such a high rating ?
whoever wrote this movie should seek help not project his sick fantasies"
" As raw and real as it gets
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,8,"This is a post-apocalyptic survival movie in its most real form. Its raw to the bones. No decoration, no flares, no special effects - just real human survival instincts in real world. Martin McCann is possibly the most under-rated actor in the industry."
" Not a Hollywood movie
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,9,"No explosions, no stunts, no one adjusting their sunglasses while looking at to the camera, no Deus ex machina, this film doesn't follow Hollywood codes.It's original, realist, unpredictable, with great acting."
" If You're in the Mood for Something Truly Depressing...
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,2,"Good acting, but an incredibly slow and dreary story of humans reverting back to animals. Somwhat interesting, but in the end, of no entertainment value unless you're about to commit suicide"
" Effective and downbeat post apocalyptic thriller
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,7,"The Survivalist lives up to its name. Taking place in a dystopian future where overpopulation leads to widespread famine, a man living by himself by a hut in the middle of the woods lives off the land and protects his livelihood. Things start to get sideways when he takes in an old woman and her daughter and an arrangement in agreed upon where he gives them food and shelter for a little poon tang from the younger daughter. The approach to the film is raw and viceral and is presented in a very realistic and downbeat manner. The acting is good and much is conveyed with little dialogue. You can feel the discomfort and tension and while I thought this was going to be more of an action piece, I can appreciate this as good for what it is and this indie thriller pulls no punches in its harsh, bleak portrayal."
" Can't finish it...
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,4,"Only watched 1/3 and couldn't finish it. The people giving 7/8/9 must be out of their minds if they watch movies at all. This flick is like a porno documentary that you don't give the audience enough time to get used to the environment, it starts flat and at least 20mins later it's still the same. So in the beginning you think it's disgusting sex trade or whatever.The mother and the girl, man, constant relentless badgering. You wanna shave the man's beard when earlier he's pointing a gun at you? Just grab the food and run, that's the real survival."
" A well-made movie but not very impactful.
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,7,"Odd movie. Kind of reminds me of 28 Days Later (2002), mostly in that it takes place in post apocalyptic Britain. It's a simple movie too. Not too much happens, as there's only three characters and not too much dialogue. Most of the plot progression takes place through drawn out actions. That's not necessarily a bad thing though, it just means that dialogue isn't a big part of the story.The protagonist is kind of an interesting character. He reveals a bit about his past which gives him some depth. Without this the movie would definitely be less interesting. You actually sympathize with the characters in this movie. They're not just blank faces in a survivalist situation - they're actual people, and they're definitely flawed too.There's a couple illogical choices made by the characters in the movie but I can forgive them since there really is only a couple at most. Like I said, it's a very simple story. The last 30 minutes or so is pretty bitter. Not really a happy ending but not the most depressing thing ever either. Kind of just, ""wow this whole situation sucks but it could be worse I guess."" Similar to The Road (2009) I suppose, although that's a much bigger, more depressing, and more impactful movie than this. I suppose this is like a lighter version of that movie, but not a rip off in any way since the stories are so different.This movie is dreary but suspenseful, and worth the watch. It's pretty well acted, although given that there's not much dialogue, and the characters are supposed to be these jaded survivors, there's not too much else they can do but look exhausted. At the end of the day, it was good but probably won't last that long in my memory, and it wasn't particularly impactful."
" Grim Future
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,7,"A fine and grim post-apocalyptic movie that aims for a mature audience - The Survivalist is for sure not your typical Hollywood hero story or big blockbuster production but a nice grim trip into a world where survival of the fittest is the one main rule again. Recommended if you enjoy such movies like The Road, Hell, Extinction, Into the Forest, The Divide, Cargo (Australia, 2017) etc. The Survivalist - a pretty good one!"
" Great acting, terrible plot.
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,1,"It's difficult to review this without spoilers, but let's just say I'd give it six stars for the first hour and a half but minus twenty for the last ten minutes. The final scene almost feels like it's been hastily tacked on after negative preview screenings, but I can't imagine a small budget film like this would be made that way so I can only assume they intended it to end like that all along. In which case I don't know what they were thinking.It's one of those films that's not nearly as clever as it thinks it is. There are so many holes in the plot/setting that it's very hard to suspend disbelief, particularly if you've ever grown any vegetables. I could go into its faults in great detail, but not without spoilers.On the other hand it's shot in a very captivating style, the acting is really very good and I really liked the minimal approach to dialogue, I just wish it hadn't come along with an equally minimal approach to plot.Oh, and I don't know what the rating is but this is definitely not suitable for children."
" Not as bad not as good as some reviewers say
",2020-01-18 00:00:00,6,"It's another good try at a post apocalypse storyline. It's welcome that it doesn't try the Hollywood ways of action packed plots that some reviewers were expecting so it has a good dose of realism but it left me a bit uninterested. The characters are realistic and with good acting but they don't have charisma, perhaps the girl is the most likeable or perhaps it's me that fails to see that in a post apocalyptic world most people would be unlikable. Situations are raw and not pleasant but in an apocalyptic world they won't be so a big thumbs up for that.
There are some things that were not credible though. The movie at the beginning seems to imply that the drastic fall in population was caused by the lact of oil worldwide. In 2020 when the world is moving towards green energies, electric vehicles and so on this plot then seems implausible. Also it rains a lot, there is plenty vegetation so animals should be plenty too so I don't understand why there is a lack of meat food. It just seems a bit odd. There are some other oddities like the young lady so easily willing to have sex with the guy on the first day. I know it's another different world but still a woman would not behave like sheep in a field I would have tought. Also when the guy keeps on pointing a two barrel shotgun at the ladies for long time and at the beginning but the ladies seem like unperturbed, I would've thought that it is a very uncomfortable feeling and you would say something like ""don't shoot""
All in all a good try but a bit flat. My favourite post apocalyptic movie is still ""The road"""
" Are you throwing hours away too?
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,2,"A generous 2 considering you could write the script on the back of a condom wrapper. With so many good critic reviews I painfully sat until the end but reader please don't be fooled. 'Mad Max in the countryside'. one said, Sure the film was more like Mad Max in his uncles' Shed with an overused 1970's Playboy magazine."
" Most Unrealistic Depiction of Survival and Most Boring Movie I've seen
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,1,"This movie is rubbish. The depiction of ""survival"" is completely, absolutely, utterly unbelievable and unrealistic in every aspect. In an apocalyptic scenario where multiple raiders/killers have visited a remote farm cabin with malice aforethought, we are asked to believe that the following can occur:Two women arrive, one young and one old. The older offers the younger in a trade: sex for food and shelter. The ""farmer"" accepts!In one unduly long and awkward scene the protagonist holds a double-barreled shotgun with one hand within arm's length or against the body of the two adult women! At any time an infant could wrest the barrel away from him, much less two adult females. Then he invites them to live *inside* his cabin, where shovels, knives and tools of all sort line the walls, always within reach. Their intention is to kill him, but they never reach for a tool and instead waste their time trying to steal two shotgun shells he keeps in his top right pants pocket. Later we find out his shotgun is *unloaded*! Jeez, what jackass carries an unloaded shotgun for protection after the apocalypse? Apparently someone trained in politically-correct film-making.The farmer is always shown building a fire or adding wood to his stove, but its green and lush outside, looks like summer, and there is neither ice nor snow! In a later scene, it's supposedly so cold the two women turn the entire cabin into a sweat lodge, splash their naked bodies with cold water and snuggle naked next to the wounded farmer's body to warm him up! This to cure the aftemath of a gunshot wound! What a pile of horse-puckey!If this movie had been properly edited it would no longer exist, there being almost nothing of validity about the depiction of survival and nothing of human interest otherwise. Oh, the two single points of validity:1. It is true that you can put fly larvae (maggots) into a wound and they will eat any dead flesh and do produce an antibiotic thereby cleansing the wound. But unlike in this movie, best to get your maggots from rotting vegetables rather than from a human grave, since there's still the possibility of catching some diseases. Or instead use honey.2. Realizing that she is dying, one of the women gets into the fellow's cabin kit for a (filter) cigarette to smoke! This is the most realistic scene in the movie. Everyone know that, faced with the end of their life, any reasonable smoker would try to get a last cigarette in before crossing over. Once she lit up it was apparent to all present, both on-screen and in the audience, that the smoker was the only one whose nerves were calmed.A movie so bad I may take up smoking!"
" Wonderful performances, but implausible story
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,4,"Wonderful performances from the three leads (Martin McCann, Mia Goth and Olwen Fouere) that are completely committed and convincing.But the story isn't terribly plausible.Perhaps it's not possible to ""devolve"" to becoming a hunter-gatherer, but if you're going to try falling back to being a farmer, you really need to do so within the context of an agrarian society in which there's communal defence. Little point investing time in planting crops if you can't protect them from marauders.This would have worked better if it had been a study of a claustrophobic relationship between the three leads, where they were completely isolated from other survivors. (Which, given the description, is what I thought it was going to be.)"
" like The Road - only they stay in one place
",2019-05-09 00:00:00,8,"This has the same sense of stillness and despair as The Road, on a fraction of the budget I'm sure. I like the use of the woodland location - it feels like mankind returning to its earliest origins - and the fact that there is a minimum not only of dialogue but of histrionic acting. It's almost like a story told with shadow puppets. A good story, too, although it's always pretty obvious where it will end up. Maybe the action, when it comes, isn't handled quite as well as the stillness.I had to laugh at the reviewer who marked it down because of the lack of real-life survival techniques shown. I saw Top Gun the other day, and do you know I still can't fly a plane? Certainly though - and I speak from experience - they wouldn't have been able to grow any food worth mentioning in that shady glade!"
" Dark & Gloomy
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,6,"Terrible starting, ended O.K.. Not my type of movie. Some scenes at the start were too gross for me to look past. Why add that? Seems to me that the writer of this movie is a little bit insecure, so he adds this crude direction so that people will say, ""Look how bold this movie is!"" Got to tell you, I hate it when movies do that."
" Although slow, it kept my attention.
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,7,"Despite the fact that it's a rather slow movie and the ending could be a bit ambivalent, it was a good movie.It can be hard for me to find a movie that's interesting enough to get my attention and, more importantly, keep it. This movie was able to keep me entertained the entire time.I found myself trying to guess what was going to happen but I was wrong several times. This movie isn't as predictable as most others in the same category."
" Gritty and tense low budget forest indie
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,8,"This is certainly not 'Mad Max in the countryside', unless one is referring to the hero being a silent type. It is a very good movie though, and a welcome apocalypse vision. It has a low budget, true. However it is also true, as another reviewer observed, that it uses clever lighting which makes it look gritty rather than cheap. The theme is dire survival, set up by a remarkable use of an opening graphic. This is possibly the cleverest opening to a film I've seen, as it immediately throws the viewer into acceptance of the scenario. No time is wasted, back of the mind goes 'OK what happens', and ka-plunk, you are there. The whole movie is about tension, and to its enduring credit it holds that tension to the end. The story itself is sparse, and whether that's a good thing or not will depend on whether the viewer enjoys character studies, particularly of people in extreme circumstance. Oddly, and interestingly, there is almost no religious faith in this nightmare except for a momentary pause early on, and it doesn't go well for spirituality. The actors are brilliant. They each bring an authentic seriousness to their parts, and nothing would have worked if that hadn't been the case. I have some quibbles however, whilst not distracting from an overall great film. The size of the garden plot was a practical problem for the realist in me, and the film had an over-preponderance to use it as a set. And I would have liked to have seen more of the surrounding forest, both by way of scavenger and patrol, as well as part of the overall cinematography."
" It didn't need to show his d*** whilst masturbating
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,7,"This overall was an enjoyable movie film, ive seen scathing reviews on here, but do you seriously expect constant action from a movie in which the majority of the plant earth has died!
People want realism and when faced with it they find it boring lol
There is a gritty dark realism to this movie that makes it enjoyable.
It would have got better marks if it didnt graphically show the guy knocking one out over a picture."
" Good Effort
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,5,"In my opinion this movie was nearly good nor bad. I think Mia Goth probably saved it from becoming a total train wreck. I believe the story is too conceded to the three individuals and focuses too much on just an isolated area. I believe this could've been done better by ""opening up the world"" a little. There was sanctuary in the storyline. I just believed it was too ""closed"" in my vague opinion."
" Excellent movie
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,10,What a powerful film. Great acting and real survival skills. Excellent film. Highly recommendable.
" Slow burn with good acting
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,7,"The movie overall was pretty good. I felt there was too much filler in the form of stares and glances(about 1/2 the movie), but what else is there to do during the End of the World filled with deceit and distrust? Realistic approach I suppose."
" Yuk - don't watch this with your Nan...
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,1,...pervy and yucky moment 20 minutes in. We turned off.
" Bleak Post-Apocalypse Film
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,8,"The Survivalist: A truly bleak post-apocalypse film. Ireland after The Fall, global population has slumped as resources run out and civilisation has collapsed. The Survivalist (Martin McCann) lives alone in a small cabin in the woods living on subsistence farming, we see him burying a body and resetting a bear-trap, he does not welcome company. Kathryn (Olwen Fouré) and her teen ""daughter"" Milja (Mia Goth) arrive on his doorstep, at first he turns them away but the prospect of sex with Milja changes his mind and he feeds them, letting them stay for the night. The next day Milja convinces him to allow them to remain with him. Milja grows to like McCann but Kathryn has plans to take over the small farm, her sabotage (stealing The Survivalist's shotgun rounds) results in problems when Milja is snatched by a drifter.Mostly filmed in the woods and the small cabin, there is claustrophobic feel to the film, one of the few occasions when we see wider vista is in fields where Milja is held captive so even there is no escape from confinement. Fouré convinces as the mother who will do what she has to in order to ensure her survival and that of her ""daughter"". She has been hardened by the years since The Fall and is unable to grasp the chance of a life which involves more than the two of them. Mia becomes torn between Fouré and McCann, she will have to make a decision. McCann has memories of how he lost his brother in a clash with other survivors, a story which is gradually pieced together. The paucity of animal life suggests that they also suffered a dieback. Only once is a rabbit caught in a tap and a bird's nest is a rare thing indeed. Raiders are also a constant fear and there is the implication that some of them are cannibals.Filmed entirely in rural settings in Northern Ireland, The Survivalists is directed and written by Stephen Fingleton and provides a worthy addition to the Irish Post-Apocalyptic Canon. 8/10."
" Effective low key thriller
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,6,"THE SURVIVALIST is a fairly effective, low key thriller set in a post-apocalyptic world. Being a low budget movie, we don't see much of this world; the enclosed setting is a cabin in the woods inhabited by the titular character, whose life is changed forever when two women show up at his home one day, looking for help. What plays out is occasionally intense but mostly a slow burner, and the surprise is that it works well despite not much going on. The film it most reminded me of was FAR NORTH, and while it's a far cry from the quality of that movie, it's still rather watchable. The performances are interesting throughout, with the actors going for a less-is-more approach, and Mia Goth in particular is a standout."
" A powerful and touching film about the fragility of our humanity
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,9,"There are not many films which have had me spellbound. This is one of the few.
Not for those who like action which satisfactorily resolves dilemma and satisfying heroics, The Survivalist examines in subtle detail some of the most fundamental issues ever discussed in drama; the 'big' subjects of faith, betrayal, fear, love and self-preservation. Where Shakespeare used lots of words, this uses glances, reflections and movements. It is amazing how so much can be conveyed in this way; the viewer is allowed to realise his/her intelligence and aptitude for mind reading.
In some movies, some things are better left unsaid.
The actors are just brilliant, in particular the central character who portrays very effectively the behaviours of someone who is forgetting how to communicate. It made me refelct upon the myriad ways of communication we take for granted now and what might happen if we were forced to live without them.I feared it would be as bleak as The Road but it operates on a more intimate, and therefore manageable scale, which to me makes it more accessible. It also has a variation in atmosphere, an escape from relentless gloom. We are drawn into an intense domestic drama and kept guessing from beginning to end.I would highly recommend this film to anyone who likes to be to be immersed in a savage and tender human drama with room to ponder and reflect. In fact if you fall into that category, I would URGE you to seek out this gem."
" Realistic account of life in future situation
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,9,"I love post apocalyptic and survival films, and this delivered a very realistic viewpoint of life after modern times as we know it.Lead actor was perfect and the shooting, props and set were just on spot.It is a simple story, told with honesty and I found myself engaged throughout, imagining myself in this position and the kind of decisions we as humans would have to make in this position."
" So so
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,8,"Why I said so?First, I hate the ""ngiiing"" sound in the beginning and it drives me crazy and uh... I slept in the first 30 minutes of the film so... yeah... I am gonna give 10 if the ngiiiiing sound removed."
" Just watched it again, and it stands up
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,9,"I love post apocalyptic films, so when I first heard of this, I checked it out. It's not any sort of monster or zombie, or mutant...it's just Humans fine rogue and totally feral. I definitely recommend this one..it needs more recognition because it truly is a fantastic"
" Awful, just awful, please stay far, far away.
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,1,"What a massive lie this movie is. Here is how it bills itself:
""Riveting. Mad Max in the countryside.""
Nothing could be further from the truth. The entire movie takes place in a makeshift cabin, supposedly in the Irish countryside, after a massive plague or apocalypse, which is never explained, involving a man, who rapes the daughter of a mother and daughter asking for help, in a way that somehow, in the depraved indifference of the apocalypse, makes it seem all okay. In perfect patriarchal form, when the food supply is decimated by outsiders, the mother asks the daughter to poison the dude. She instead poisons the mother. Later, dude is killed by the initial marauders, who both resemble and behave absolutely nothing like the Road Warrior characters. 
So here's what you get: great acting, solid screenplay, decent cinematography, great lighting, competent directing...and an extremely boring and disappointing film without passion or redemption. Again, no problem if they told us this upfront, rather than trying build up an action film that is exactly the opposite. Don't watch or buy this film. Their goal is to dupe you into believing it is 28 days later combined with Fury Road. It was filmed in someone's grandmother's backyard."
" Well made
",2018-06-03 00:00:00,8,"Well worth seeing movies in the Netflix. Specially if you are in to post apocalyptic movies, survival stories. It's a rated R film. Would not recommend watching it with a family."
" All the Reviews Are Correct
",2018-05-15 00:00:00,6,"Some audience reviewers gave ""The Survivalist"" one star; some gave the film 10 stars. I understand the point of both ratings. The film does move like a turtle with four broken legs. At the same time, one can't stop watching. As of 5/14/18, there are 69 reviews of this film on IMDb, so the important points about the film are all ready made. This is the type of film that makes one want to turn it off after the first half-hour, or the film sucks you in."
" Very well done movie
",2018-04-08 00:00:00,10,As other reviews state it will be too slow for some. However I found it to be extremely well made. Puts Hollywood movies to shame. One of the most realistic and gritty post apocalyptic movies I have ever seen.
" Ignorance is bliss?
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,1,"+1SPOILER ALERT (not really an alert as there is nothing to ""spoil"", but hey...)This film can be most positively described as torpid, cinematic drivel. There is no plot (none worth noting) and no real acting, but there are many well filmed shot of the woods, so it gets two stars for cinematography. The costuming and scene sets are laughable. I want Fingleton's brand of laundry detergent, such white pillowcases... lovely. The main character is an uninteresting, incompetent bungler who has been lucky enough to last seven years alone in a post-apocalyptic woods without being killed. He isn't a ""survivalist"" at all and has no defensive skills, rather he blunders about without much of a plan tending to a child's garden which could never support him (designed by people who don't know what a subsistence garden looks like), regularly leaves himself completely undefended (2 shells are nothing), never attempts to find or construct new weaponry or build any sort of defences apart from cans on a string (7 years and he can't make a single spear or trap). He's only alive because he hides. There's hardly any dialogue, which is probably a mercy as there is no real plot; it's all about maudy looks and Fingleton has just one expression, the face of a frightened weasel. (Credit where due, Goth has mentally challenged and bored down pat, what range.) No one is attractive, but they all have good bodies. Perhaps that is realistic in an apocalyptic world, but it's so a la mode to ""fix"" actors with unattractive faces by sending them to the gym, that it grates. I realise that apparently faces are irrelevant these days because audiences find any actor with a well muscled bodies attractive, but they should be able to actually act; of course without lines or a plot, what can one do? When the other ""bad guys"" finally catch the ""survived for a bit by hidingist"" for dinner it's a great relief; at least he finally has a purpose. Its a pity they missed Goth and the script writer..."
" Mia goth only
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,6,This movie is good for the reason Mia goths superb performance otherwise no good actors or acting
" Gratuitous in every sense
",2017-12-15 00:00:00,1,"I just don't care about him doing stuff if it doesn't connect much with the plot. The characters were also primitive and unlikable. I'm watching someone cleaning their butt, beating their meat, collecting stuff to put into a tin can for no educational or plot-observable reason, and it's all so dreadfully boring. There are survival videos which show you how to survive, and there are survival movies which give you plots with actual circulation. This has neither and is like watching someone do their laundry. I suggest disregarding this gratuitous movie and finding something else."
" Disgusting and Boring! but more so Disgusting!
",2017-11-14 00:00:00,1,"What was the point of showing this guys butt as he washed himself up and then him playing with himself? and I mean these weren't quick scenes they dragged on. Except the last one I turned it off I'm not watching that. This isn't a movie it's a gay porn. I have no idea what this movie was trying to be and never will. If you want to make a movie about ""survival"" start with an actual plot. I can do without the unnecessary stuff thrown in this garbage."
" As brutal as it gets!
",2017-11-08 00:00:00,10,"Wow. What a great film. This is a post- apocalyptic movie that I grade a ""medium fantasy"" universe. ""The Road"" and the Mad Max films are ""Low Fantasy"". There is no functioning government. Supplies of all kind are fought over viciously. It's awful. ""The Postman"", ""Hardware"" ""Blade Runner 2049"" and ""Jericho"" are ""High Fantasy"". This has the trappings of an apocalyptic event but humanity managed to survive it. There is access to food, electricity, sanitation, &c. Stable governments still exist. There are some films that are hybrids of the different classifications. The Mad Max films are technically a low setting. But they are also a high setting due to a warlord ruling through power, fear and pig poop. ""The Survivalist"" lacks both elements needed for survival... but the environment and ecosystem still exist. There are still is a way to survive. It's a ""Medium fantasy"" post apocalyptic setting. Man, this movie is bleak. There is no musical score. I keep thinking there was because my brain is conditioned to hear music during movies. I loved the fact there was almost no music though. I hate those commercials that use music to sway fickle human sentiment. The awful situation should produce a humane response on it's own merit. Life doesn't have a soundtrack. Or maybe I am not listening for it.This lack of music makes the entire movie very grim. It's pretty dark in places. There's lots of nudity too. But it is story telling nudity and not gratuitous. I suspect the director intentionally avoided showing the young gal full frontal on purpose. There's plenty of Richard swinging around and old lady nudity (Rembrandt fans rejoice). If you are offended by nudity I would suggest passing this film by.This film almost got a 8 or 9 because of how brutal the abortion scene was. The entire emotional center of the film was revealed when the girl read the awful human atrocity book: ""The inhumanity of man against man"" and a bunch of horrible death pictures. Oh, and the abortion scene is the only time you get to see female genitalia. I may be reading into the author's intention (for some reason ""Eye- So-Gee-Sis"" is a forbidden word on IMDb) by saying this. I think the way females were handled in this film strengthens the inhumanity of man theme. How callous must a man be to mistreat the progenitor of life (broads) *joke*If you are a post apocalyptic movie fan this is a great watch. If you want a film to enjoy with the pg-13 girlfriend... watch ""Trolls"" instead (which is a great film in it's own right)."
" A review for the rest of us
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,3,"This movie had an interesting premise, and I appreciated the atmosphere it built. I also appreciated how faithful they were in showing survival techniques, and the minimalist approach they took to the film. But I can't help but feel very bored by this movie. We know exactly how things will end when the other two characters (finally) make it on screen, and they drag this out perpetually. Despite everything he does for them, the mother insists on stealing and trying to force her daughter to kill him, so they can take the farm for themselves (even after he saves Milja from being raped). I wanted them to just make a decision and kill someone, but they refuse to until almost the end. Thankfully they make the right choice, but even this comes much too late.When we finally see some action and the farm is raided a second time, they only manage to kill three people. I have to wonder how he survived so long without at least trapping the perimeter. The ending is unsatisfactory and begs the question why they didn't consider larger communities before, if the mother was indeed so concerned for her daughter's health and well-being.There are way too many artistic shots that serve no real purpose other than to make another character naked. The subsistence farming/foraging is all shown in the first 45 minutes, so seeing it again and again throughout the movie serves no purpose other than to drag out the film. The severe lack of dialogue or even any real story to pass the time ends up making the entire movie choke itself in its own claustrophobic melancholy, but even this isn't very compelling so much as it is autoerotic asphyxiation. This movie and its fans are a little too full of themselves. I appreciate what it was trying to accomplish, but it could've been done far better. Or at least been given a shorter run- time."
" Excellent Movie? Spoiler.
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,10,"SPOILER... Read AFTER you see the movie.I read a few reviews, both good and bad, and was motivated to post because just like The Road, my take away from the movie seemed different from the general sentiment.It was pretty clear to me who the Survivalist was. And it wasn't a male character.Excellent Movie."
" Same lineage than ""The Road""
",2017-10-12 00:00:00,8,"You dive in the world of a lonely guy, trying to survive after an apocalyptic event. It's not a fast action movie, there is a lot of tension from the start till the end. It's not about big explosions and guns, rather interactions between this guys and 2 strangers.Its an excellent movie but don't watch it if you re a bit depressed, it's in the same vein than the excellent ""The road"". Dark and hopeless."
" Very slow and boring
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,5,"This is the kind of movie you can watch in fast-forward, with only a pauses here and there to sniff around. In fact, I recommend it.But even if you watch the whole thing you will be left with lots of questions. What caused population to fall after oil production fell? Once population fell, why was food scarce? Why didn't more people grow food? There was nothing but land and wilderness as far as the eye could see, but only one guy growing a tiny little patch of vegetables? Why did the guy grow such a small patch? Why didn't they expand the garden when the women showed up? Why not use that open field to grow even more food? So again...why on earth was food scarce? Was there some rule that only this one guy was allowed to grow food? And at the end when she finally found a settlement, why were the people walking around in the grass pretending it was a farm? There were no fields of vegetables, only grass? Was that a movie mistake, or did they plan to eat that saw grass? And lastly, what the heck is wrong with people who can't make a decent, believable movie?"
" The Survivalist: Certainly not the mainstream
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,3,"The survivalist leaves a lot to the imagination, telling the story of our lead a man who lives out in the wilderness paranoid and alone when his world is disrupted by the appearance of two women.Does he risk his perfect though limited little world by allowing them access to his home or should he turn them away? The Survivalist is a dark gritty tale that pulls no punches, I found myself oddly empathising and relating to the lead and yet at the same time was frustrated by that distinct lack of entertainment value I found.This multi award winning effort simply didn't connect with me and though I certainly appreciate what they were going for unfortunately didn't see the appeal.Credit to the cast, credit to the film makers but for me this made for uncomfortable viewing and a really lackluster finale.The Good: All round well made Strong performances Great concept The Bad: Uncomfortable stuff Certainly niche viewing Weak endingThings I Learnt From This Movie: The survivalist lifestyle isn't as glamorous as others may have you believe Don't let women in your life, they'll ruin everything"
" Survival of the fittest and smartest !!!
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,8,"This might be the most stripped down, raw, grounded and realistic portrayal of a post-apocalyptic world I have ever seen in a film. Instead of the glamorised version that is offered in films like the Mad Max series and others, 'The Survivalist' pulls no punches and gives us a very detailed and methodical look into what it requires to survive in a world like this. Unlike the decrepit and broken down representations of post-apocalyptic worlds that are found in other films, the world in 'The Survivalist' looks really beautiful and bountiful. The director Stephen Fingleton categorically juxtaposes the prosperity of nature with the desperation for survival of the characters in the film. It underlines nature's indifference to human suffering reminiscent of Satyajit Ray's 'Distant Thunder'.What I really liked about 'The Survivalist' is the very very economical use of dialogue. Dialogue is used very very infrequently and so much of the storytelling takes place through visuals. The heavy reliance on visuals, ambient noises and sound effects to convey the protagonist's methodical approach to surviving in this tough, merciless world, really reminded me of J.C. Chandor's 'All Is Lost' starring Robert Redford. But then once the women arrive at his doorstep, the tone changes. After that, we get into an immensely interesting exploration of power dynamics, compromise and collaboration. Fingleton brilliantly confronts us with the central dilemma of the film that plagues the protagonist - whether to rigidly stick to his code for survival or compromise and give in to his needs for physical intimacy after 7 years of living in isolation. I believed and enjoyed the dynamics between the three characters and the cat & mouse game they play between each other to gain supremacy in the power struggle.Just like a few other post-apocalyptic films like 'The Road' or 'Children of Men', 'The Survivalist' ends on a optimistic note which somewhat comes out of nowhere and can seem like a bit of a cop out. But I can completely understand why Fingleton opted to end the film like that and I also appreciate how that ending ends up glorifying a certain sacrifice that a character makes just before it, but I probably would've loved a brutally realistic ending, more in keeping with the rest of the movie.The performances from all the three actors playing the central characters, namely Martin McCann, Mia Goth and Olwen Fouéré are all great.Highly Recommended."
" A Harrowing, Dystopian Thriller? Hardly.
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,3,"This film has been hailed by some as a cinematic masterpiece. I'm guessing that the reviewers are either related to the cast or fell asleep half-way through this turgid waste of time and dreamt something wonderful.The story itself is bereft of any real background and the viewer is left to their own devices in most instances to work out what's actually going on.Our intrepid hero, played by Martin McCann, has apparently survived in his little shack for seven years after some undisclosed calamity. We find later that he happily hamstrung his own brother to ensure his own survival, so we're dealing with a real champion here.After a few scenes of action man in various stages of undress, along with dragging a nude corpse around within the initial moments of the movie, we're greeted with a rather crass scene of him attempting to masturbate whilst looking at a photo of a fully clothed woman that he found after slaughtering someone earlier.This really sets the tone for the rest of the movie.Enter a mother & daughter, hoping that our hero will give them food or other succour. After a brief discussion about how he's not going to help them, the mother-of-the-year happily pimps her daughter out for a meal. Olwen Fouéré, the mother, plays her role of a shrewd, untrustworthy and heartless bitch to the nth degree.Her daughter is played by Mia Goth, who, whilst attractive in her own way, seems to think that having a vacant, slack-jawed expression whilst getting naked is a key to stardom.Some more gratuitous nudity is given and, at some point within the movie, all three actors have full-frontal scenes. Our buffed hero is obviously meant to display his 'manliness' and his new concubine is the formulaic 'hot chick getting naked' but I'm rather baffled as to Olwen's nude scenes. Watching a late middle-aged, flabby woman float around a pond naked is hardly hardcore porn, but it's use to the storyline is debatable. Perhaps the director wanted to show that he was a equal opportunity director or very much into the empowerment of women?The movie heads rapidly downhill from there with Mia falling pregnant, more scheming by Olwen to kill the Survivalist and, finally, ending with the death of the mother and our hero, the destruction of the 'farm' and Mia's flight from the perpetrators of the destruction.The final scene has her wandering up to a large, wire-fenced encampment. Apparently, this is the sort of place that our survivalist hero & his brother used to raid in an effort to steal supplies. Whilst Mia stands forlornly at the gate, a female guard in a tower asks Mia how far along she has to go. She replies about 6 months and when asked about a name, she replies 'If it's a boy'.The credits roll on that line. Apparently the director couldn't even work out an appropriate final line and thought he'd make to with half a sentence.In closing, the movie is predominantly boring and bleak. I expect some will gush about its 'grittiness' or 'edginess', but then we also live in a world with the Kardashians as stars."
" Finally a credible piece on post-apocalyptic survival
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,9,"Extraordinarily well executed, fresh, replete with lots of smart details bring it all to life. The characters are believable; raw and wild, running on their baser instincts, struggling to be civil in a world where gnash-toothed animals survive and civility only gets you dead. They try to be civil! Oh bless their hearts they try.What I loved the most is the transformation you see in the characters; they go from feral, viciously unlikeable creeps to slowly warming up and right before your eyes they bloom into something like humans again, full of love and empathy and hate and greed and loyalty and all the paradoxes of the human condition. The setting is well fleshed out, with enough mystery regarding the details of society's breakdown to suspend any disbelief you might have about the premise. You feel like it's real. The characters further help you sense the desperation and anxiety of the world portrayed here. It's very somatic; you feel the hunger, the distrust, the anger and the violence of revenge.I was left feeling grateful for the world I live in, which is the purpose of theme I suspect. It really could be worse. Watch this movie and feel intense gratitude for your humdrum life. Enjoy!"
" Not the best, not the worst
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,6,"It's surely not the best but also not the worst survival movie I've seen. It has ""survival"" mistakes that someone living 7 years in the wild should not do.He makes his own fuel for the lamp but also needs wick and he uses a cotton one. 7 years worth of cotton wick it's a lot. Think several hundred feet at least.In 7 years he remained way to dependent on non-renewable technology like the shotgun for witch he only has 2 shells. He didn't made at least a bow and arrows, or a crossbow. Only has bear traps and no pitfalls or anything like that to protect his ""empire"".The acting is OK. If you don't wanna see an old hag naked, just skip the scenes when the old lady takes a bath and the one when she is buried.As I said, I've seen better survival movies, and I've also seen bigger budgets that were way worse."
" Survival instinct.
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,10,"Left breathless by the British Sci-Fi Post-Apocalypse Horror The Girl with All the Gifts, I started watching Videos related to it. Letting the Vids play on, I stumbled on a review by Mark Kermode for a minimalist British ""hard Sci-Fi"" Post-Apocalypse. Finding comments linking it to All the Gifts and the minimalist cast (three people) of fellow Brit ""hard Sci-Fi"" Ex_Machina, I joined in the fight for survival.The plot:Since a drop in crude oil has led to the end of civilisation, a survivalist has been living in the countryside for seven and a half years. After the death of his brother, the survivalist has been tending to his own plot of land. One day he hears a sudden knock at the door,and the survivalist is met by Kathryn and her daughter Milja,who are desperate for food and drink. Keeping his gun on them,he agrees to what they want, in exchange for Kathryn helping out with the garden, and Mija having sex with him. Soon bonding together, Kathryn tells Mija that the plot of land is only big enough for two people. View on the film:Planting just a handful of dialogue in the entire film, writer/director Stephen Fingleton marks his feature film debut with an astonishingly assured confidence. Playing the opening 15 minutes in complete silence of human voice, Fingleton & cinematographer Damien Elliott turn the sound of the apocalypse up with an Ambient (no score) soundtrack of cracking twigs, rain tapping on the roof and birds whistling in the distance of a world gone long ago. Marking the credits with the line of existence dropping, Fingleton makes the survivors existence a terrible life, with gruelling, extended takes by Fingleton pulling the mistrusting nature of the trio into the open.Exchanging sex for food and water, Fingleton rubs a grubby atmosphere over the screen, with the lighting making the sex look bleaker than the soil outside. Slicing into the mistrust that haunts the place, Fingleton chillingly presents things as matter of fact, with Mija having to go to the river to wash away the blood from her period, showing how everyday essentials have all been lost. Focusing on the present rather than the past, the screenplay by Fingleton makes every piece of dialogue count via it only being used when a character is trying to find a secure way to survive. Entering as outsiders, Olwen Fouere and Mia Goth give masterful performances as mum and daughter Kathryn and Milja. Looking New Age, Fouere peels away at any warmth from Kathryn to revealing a calculating mother, whose loyalty solely lays in her and Mija's survival, whilst Goth gives Milja a cold shoulder vagueness which stops anyone knowing what she truly thinks. Never letting his guard down, Martin McCann gives an incredibly rustic performance as the Survivalist,with McCann putting the desperation of the situation across with cold, soulless glances giving all the ""dialogue"" anyone could need,as the Survivalist fights for survival."
" I highly recommend it!
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,9,"'THE SURVIVALIST': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A British post-apocalyptic thriller, filmed all in Northern Ireland, about a violent future world where people must 'kill or be killed' in order to survive. It tells the story of a survivalist man, who reluctantly teams up with two women, one older and one younger, even though there's a strong possibility they might attempt to kill him at any time. It was written and directed by debut feature filmmaker Stephen Fingleton, and it stars Martin McCann, Mia Goth and Olwen Fouere. The film was made on a budget of just $1 million, and it's only received a limited indie theatrical and VOD release, but it's received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics; it's also won multiple prestigious international awards, and been nominated for many more. I thoroughly enjoyed it.The movie tells the story of an unnamed survivalist man (McCann), who has been living on his own for some time in the middle of the woods. He's built a small cabin for himself there, where he harvests crops for food, and defends himself by setting up traps (for intruders) around his little farm. When two women, one older (Fouere) and one younger (Goth), come to his cabin asking for food, he's very reluctant to trust or help them. He agrees to give them food though, and a place to stay for one night, in exchange for sex with the younger woman. He then reluctantly agrees to let the women stay longer, which could eventually lead to his death (as they secretly plot to kill him).The film starts out pretty slow-paced, as it spends a significant amount of time just showing how the survivalist lives (on his own in the woods). The movie shows his daily routine in great detail, even to the extent of showing him masturbate on seeds in order to help them grow. Even after the two female characters enter the film though, there's very little dialogue; especially from the lead character, who has very few lines in the entire movie. Once the two women characters do enter the story though, the film is almost always engaging from there on (until the very last scene). It turns into a very dark and disturbing film, that's also sometimes very intense to watch. Although there's very little dialogue in it, the movie is also a great characters study as well. As disturbing as the film almost always is, it's still a very fascinating and worthwhile movie to experience. I highly recommend it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/hAV3iy1JkJ8"
" Read all the reviews before paying to see
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,4,"I must have missed the masturbatory scene and I am glad I did. This was definitely a man's film. It is better to see a movie this depressing when it has some beautiful scenery, like Dr. Zhivago. (I didn't like Dr. Zhivago, either.) I just wish I had read the reviews all the way down. I just saw all those stars and the praise. The worst part was the complete lack of communication. You would think that when the oil runs out and we have no technology, that we will talk to each other again. The one good thing about seeing this movie is that you realize that most of history and most of the world has to struggle to eat but most of us who can afford to rent a movie don't have to think about it."
" wilderness is tough
",2017-05-26 00:00:00,7,"a man, unnamed, is surviving by himself in the wild. we know there are others around because he has set up all kinds of traps and alarms. somehow, two women show up on his property unannounced. of course, only a woman could be smart enough to get through his defenses. (this is a joke). anyway, the younger woman has just what our survivalist wants and he lets them stay and share his bounty. of course, the women have something in mind. the film has a real look and surviving looks tough. it seems like not much happens, but, in fact, a lot does. it's violent and unpleasant in some ways, but intriguing. not for everyone, obviously, because you have to anticipate, instead of knowing what's coming two hours ahead."
" Low Budget Low Interest
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,2,"5 minutes into this 100 minute movie should have been enough to alert me to the fact that: YOU ARE WATCHING A MOVIE MADE IN AN IRISH GARAGE. Instead I watched the whole mess -- gory wounds with graphic surgery, about 3 minutes of badly written dialogue, male and female genitalia, and aimless wandering. Did I mention the medicinal use of maggots? Skip this flick and find one that was actually a properly financed film with something entertaining in it. Another reviewer captured this film's essence in a single word: GRIM. Perhaps the best word is CHEAP. I should have followed my instinct and stopped watching this amateurish effort at minute number 5. Shameful. How does this movie get distributed to innocent audiences like us? We were had."
" Spits in the face of Hollywood
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,8,"This film is a prime example of how well researched material can take the smallest of budgets, minimal dialogue and a complete lack of soundtrack and turn this into a masterpiece.The viewer is given no background story and none of the characters are fleshed out. There is next to no information on anyone in the film apart from the main character, and even with him, there is very little information given. But that is the point. The strength of the film lies not in the story but the idea of what one does to survive when life goes back to basics. The viewer's attention is drawn to the intensity of the situation, the survival skills that are actual knowledge one needs to survive in the wild. The cold and barren undertone of the film should have been the reason for its failure. Instead, it serves to emphasise the stark and bleak situation that all the characters are faced with. The script does not pull any punches and a strong stomach is needed for some scenes. And if you get the gist of the film so far, then you will already know whether there is a happy ending or not..."
" Spoilers follow ...
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,7,"Not that it matters, but I've found it very hard to stick with a horror film longer than 20 minutes of late. A possible mixture of over-familiarity and the relentless 'getting-to-know-you' set-up of characters that are difficult to care about has seen to that. 'The Survivalist' is thankfully entirely different.Martin McCann plays the unnamed titular character who is seen meticulously tending to the allotment surrounding his remote shack. The world's economy has stopped, society has imploded, and this results in a back-to-basics culture for the few remaining. Occasionally, a glimpse of an ideal world is apparent – all the trappings of modern day culture gone, The Survivalist's solitary nature is stripped back to the bare essentials. Memories of a brother long dead, a photograph of an unspecified girl kept for masturbationary purposes – all this is shattered by the arrival of Kathrine (Olwen Fouéré) and her daughter Mia (Mia Goth). These two, despite their good deeds, are rarely entirely trustworthy, but a relationship is built – initially on Mia being a bargaining chip in exchange for food, and ultimately on something approaching mutual friendship.This is a bleak film, but not quite as grim as it may appear. There is no soundtrack other than the beginning and end theme. We hear the irresistible crackling of fires, the plaintive tweeting of the birds, and still feelings of fear, apprehension (but never jollity) are communicated to the viewer. Perhaps those directors who smother their films with mass orchestrated musical stings and bangs and whistles designed to instil fear should take note! The Survivalist has been nominated for, and won, a variety of awards, for Mia Goth and Director/Writer Stephen Fingleton. Well deserved. The fall and further fall of these characters is compelling viewing."
" Uncompromising Sci Fi for grown ups.
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,9,"This is one of those films that you're probably going to either love or hate. It's certainly not one for the faint hearted and there's an unrelenting sense of darkness and tension that underpins the whole film. It's certainly not escapism in the vein of the recent brilliant but bonkers Mad Max. But that's kind of the point, what it does, and does so brilliantly is add a sense of 'kitchen sink' realism to a post apocalyptic world. You get the feeling that his is how the world really would be after the apocalypse, a quieter, sadder more desperate place. At it's heart it's a film about humanism and morality and the way both of these are shaped by the environment around us. All the characters are cast in shades of grey, driven to ruthless acts in order to survive and yet it's still all to easy to empathise with them. A bold uncompromising feature with perhaps my favourite opening titles sequence of all time."
