" It broke my heart.
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,9,"I was literally amazed at Aniston's ACTUAL ability to jump to this very serious movie, with great comedic interludes. She was absolutely convincing, and this is a must see for anyone who deals with chronic pain, or has a family member that does. Great to see a movie where the lead doesn't 'overact' to drive the point home. Aniston handled this with precision.
There must have been considerable effort to research how daily pain with very little hope for relief affects people, and how they exist day to day.
I found the portrayal to be incredibly real, and can honestly say I was proud of Aniston's amazing performance. It broke my heart for those folks that live like this day to day.
There was an occasional moment where I had an occasional niggle that the timelines weren't exactly right, which is the only reason I withheld one star."
" Frank, interesting, challenging, entertaining
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,9,"Really enjoyed this movie. It does not sugarcoat the challenges faced by chronic pain sufferers (something I do not have experience with myself) and loss. The characters are intriguing. Aniston's performance is very strong, I believe it is her best. Clever plot development.Have seen it twice - family enjoyed it as well. Led to some interesting conversations."
" Drugged Out
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,3,"This movie would have better as a documentary. There was no entertaining value to it. Sorry Jen, Stick with the comedies."
" Indie. Realistic. Ingenious screenplay. Beautifully shot.
",2020-11-27 00:00:00,9,Beautifully shot. Aniston's best performance so far. Very realistic. Simple story but ingenious screenplay. Loved the colour palette used. The make-up is so well done that Aniston's scars look real. Liked that it is performance-driven with very minimal background score.
" Smart & intelligent
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,7,"I always liked JA in Friends. But every film she has been in since always seems to be a dud. Bad screenplays & unlikeable co-stars.
But this is different. In this film JA really comes across as real. Not so likeable, but very real.
Its a great expose on grief & pain & how screwed up people can become, it shows some of the way out of the darkness. Its not some happily ever after film, but much more believable."
" One of my favorites
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"I watched this movie for the first time several years ago and have seen it at least twenty times since. Why have I watched it so many times? When I need to cry. One of a handful of movies that no matter how many times I see it, tears rolling at several scenes. Worth watching just for the screen chemistry between Jennifer Aniston and Adriana Barraza alone. What a great film. Yes, I agree Jennifer was completely and totally ripped off by not getting an Oscar nod for this film. Showcases that she is actually quite a fine dramatic actress. Her performance as a woman suffering with chronic pain, emotional trauma and addiction is completely spot on. A heartbreaking film with a breathtaking ending. Every time."
" so so boreing !
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,1,"As a survivor of 2 accidents , having lots of screws in my leg and losing the closets to me in those car accidents i could not even share a tear here in this movie or feel anything ... except that f... pain .. oh yeah.. pain all that movie she is in pain and drugs and it is so boring ! so many scenes in one movie of a person taking pain killers? how many ? too many !!! more than 10 ? even 20 ? i didn't count but all i will remember from this movie will be that she was in pain and was taking lots of painkillers ... that was the focus on throughout ... action ? hmmmm where was it ? any interesting deep talk after what happened? where was it ? i couldn't wait till it finish and then in half movie i actually didn't care how it will finish ... and only thing i wanted to know how this accident happened and what connection it all had with the suicidal woman but it bored me so much that i donÂ´t care any more .
life after accidents like that is not only drama and pain ... there is something like a shift in life .. there is compassion of others and help of strangers .. its not only pain and frustration with whole world any everybody around . its hard as hell but its not only pain , pills and tears .. not a deep movie .. not enlightening .. nothing .. just giving more fear into this world and more pain .. and pills .."
" Sets Aniston apart as an actress.
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,10,"Her character couldn't be further removed from Rachel Green. She carries the role brilliantly. No, this isn't a light hearted movie. No it doesn't 'offer hope'. It is however a very realistic portrait of depression, suffering with chronic pain and grief."
" Jennifer Aniston gives a good and authentic performance as a chronic pain victim
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,7,"And that's what this movie is about: what your life is like when you live in constant, never-ending, chronic pain.
As a sufferer of chronic pain myself for the last 9 years (from a slipped disc that presses on the main nerve plus arthritis) I unfortunately know all about this kind of life. And the worst part is, it's not much of a life at all. I have no idea if Anniston has chronic pain in real life, but if she doesn't, she certainly did her homework before playing the role. And she gets chronic pain exactly right - living with it isn't a matter of moaning and groaning every minute of your life, even when that's what you feel. You can't do that - because if you do, everyone you love and value in your life will burn out on you, very quickly, and will disappear. So you spend much of your life hiding your pain as best you can. And, the only way you know that you are hiding it well is when friends and family forget, and try to get you to do something with them you can no longer do, because of your chronic pain. And then you see the inevitable disappointment, and the resentment, and you know they have just dropped you from another little part of their lives - and you wonder if and when they might drop you altogether.And as Claire, Anniston manages to show her day to day life in a subtle, under-stated way, but one I instantly related to. She manages to show what it's like, living in your own bubble of pain, surrounded by the able bodied who feel nothing like you do, and get to feel how you used to feel, before your curse of chronic pain. She shows the frustration, the anxiety over medication, and the illicit activity she must do to get her medicine (in Mexico), and what it feels like to watch life go on around you, and without you to a great extent. I think Jennifer Anniston did a great job playing this role - and I'll never underestimate her as an actress again."
" Great Acting, but terribly depressing
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,4,"I loved Jennifer Aniston's acting. However, I do not enjoy movies that don't present much hope and in my opinion this movie didn't. It is a poignant statement about how people with extremely excruciating pain suffer and endure."
" Slow moving and dull
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,2,"There seems to be an overwhelming amount of positive reviews on here and much praise towards Jennifer Anniston's portrayal in which several reviews are claiming she should have received an Oscar nomination. Note: she did receive a Golden Globe nomination but this film falls too short for an Oscar nom, and having remembered the 2014 Leading actress race was tight.As a film this is quite disappointing. It is just relatively slow moving. This type of film deals with serious issues and should have had more of a dramatic tone but even so it felt somewhat light hearted- mainly due to the scenes involving Jennifer Anniston seeing Anna Kendrick's spirit/hallucinations- although they were good scenes.Anniston's character was just unlikeable to everyone, even those who were there to help her (especially her maid). It is hard to sympathize with a leading character when we see them being disrespectful and dozing on drugs consistently (as her character appeared to use them to ""help"" her).The story just wasn't interesting enough, nor were the characters. Perhaps if the writing was better, this would have been more well received. Also the title of ""Cake"" just represents one of the final scenes- which is rather bizarre to call the film after so. I'm sure a better title could have been thought of."
" A Heartfelt Story About Physical and Mental Pain
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,9,"Simply put, this movie is about finding something to live for when all you have is pain. At first, this movie seems a little strange as we are introduced to Claire, a woman who is obsessed with another woman who committed suicide. However, we quickly learn that these two characters went to the same support group for people who suffer from chronic pain. The only difference is that this other woman found the strength to do what Claire can't. She committed suicide. Claire's obsession with this death of someone she didn't really know, and her own desire to kill herself turns the film into a powerful portrayal of people who are in both in physical and mental pain. It also realistically depicts how it is to suffer from depression. This movie was quite good. Jennifer Aniston simply kills it as an unstable, drug-addicted woman who is clearly in pain. Sam Worthington also kills it as a morning husband, and he has great chemistry with Aniston. Anna Kendrick's performance was also excellent, even though she only in the film for a few minutes. The only thing I would change is that there isn't enough focus on the reasons behind Claire's mental pain, and the reveal at the end comes a little bit too late. Nevertheless, this is a great movie for anyone who has had to battle depression."
" Great Movie ""Cake"", Far exceeded my expectations
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,9,"Maybe critics and voters haven't had enough pain in their lives to appreciate this movie. I've had pain in my life and related to this movie. I thought Jennifer Anniston would have been Oscar material for her portrayal of Claire.Jennifer Anniston is one of my favorite actresses, but more than that one of my favorite human beings. This movie is too real and painful to watch for those that prefer their Spiderman, Batman, Fast and Furious, et al. But I loved it and recommend it to all."
" I have watched twice in less than month.
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,8,This movie deserves more than 6 . Jennifer Aniston must have an Oscar in this movie.
" I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,5,"I'm the only one who didn't understood this movie? I mean...ok she's been through an accident and her kid died but that's all.
I give it 5/10 for Jennifer Aniston acting who was very good, but the movie was boring."
" Spectacular performance by Jennifer Anniston
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,8,"Very well constructed drama about chronic pain, loss, and intriguing relationships! A very nice change of pace for Jennifer not being in rom-coms , I'm glad she was at least nominated for an Oscar even though she didn't win. Spelling binding incredible experience all around!"
" Best Aniston film
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,9,"Wonderful,liked it from the beginnig to end. Jennifer was great and I felt all the film inside me. Warm drama..."
" Just why?
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,5,Good acting but way to many questions that I felt were not answered. I was hoping more would have been explained by the end. Maybe I am just dumb. Watch yourself and hopefully you can make more sense than I did of it.
" Adriana Barraza deserved AA nomination
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,8,"This was really a timely piece insofar as it relates to opioid addiction though there is not much evidence that Claire is not in constant pain. It is actually painful to watch her suffering even though she does a terrific acting job. In my mind Jennifer Aniston never disappoints performance wise. But the highlight of the movie for me, besides the writing is Adriana Barraza who is absolutely fabulous as Clare's housekeeper/nurse/therapist. I actually saw this when it first came out and meant to write a review at that time lauding her performance and just never got around to it. Seeing the movie again I feel worse about not praising her work earlier. She was fantastic. A movie that is definitely worth seeing."
" One of Aniston's Best
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,9,"This movie showed the Jennifer Aniston is Not just another HWood pretty face. I lover her in RomCom's however, this role was a stretch for Jennifer and showed she has ""chops"" in the acting department. It was a gritty thought provoking role and I thoroughly enjoyed the storyline. It was a role that made Me think, How would I React in the circumstances that Aniston was in.
I'm routing for JA to do More of the gut wrenching roles after watching this."
" Somber
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,5,A somber depiction of a suicidal person hooked on opiates.
" Wow-not a story about pain-it's about trauma; emotional trauma.
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,10,"The final sequence is a crescendo juxtaposing the forces of physical and emotional pain. So many ways to try to find fault with what this film is not about-it is not about physical pain.It is about the emotional trauma that physical pain medication cloaks.Claire is a powerful woman, and her weakness, like so many who have experienced physical trauma, is not the coinciding physical pain (so easily medicated), nor the addiction that often co-occurs (so easily overcome). Instead, it is the recovery from the emotional aspects of the trauma. The loss.Righting her seat up to face the world is an elegant and powerful statement about what it takes to truly heal from trauma. This dramatic portrayal of devastating loss is entertaining, but imagine the scale of (clear) Claire's emotional loss, divided by half, half again, then half of that and you still have a degree of trauma that is commonly mis-medicated by our health care systems with unnecessary opioids. What is needed is more empathy from a society too wrapped-up in quick or easy solutions that we fail to recognize that the complexities of human-beings demand a different therapy. Trauma opens ""mental channels"" that take the victim back emotionally to every other trauma they have experienced since birth. It becomes another layer on top of an already difficult-to-manage pile of repeating pain, and this film caught that essence, very artistically, perhaps too much so, but for viewers who are prepared to open up and be vulnerable to allowing their personal trauma to be accessed, it is a richly rewarding and cathartic experience. It is a live letter to the overlooked and under appreciated toll of emotional pain."
" You Never Know What Someone's Carrying
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,7,"This is the 1st listed 'goof' from the Cake IMDB page:""Claire's pain appears to be in her legs - it was said she had pins in her legs - and during the swimming sequence, they show a long scar that runs from above to below her knee. If it were this injury, she would not be able to squat down to slip into the pool and if it were as bad as indicated, she would have a harder time walking. Additionally, it wouldn't require her to lay down in the car during her travels.""Whoever wrote this has a poor understanding of physiology and clearly didn't pay much attention to to the film's plot. Their criticism does a disservice to Aniston's excellent portrayal of someone with chronic pain.1) Claire presents as someone w/pain in both her back and her legs. She walks w/a pretty classic and slow chronic pain shuffle. Every time she gets up-from her bed, the car seat, a barstool-she does so gingerly, flinching. Like a much older person w/a stiff, sore back and legs. In the sex scene, she can't bear weight.2) They don't show her squatting @ the therapy pool. She is sitting on the pool's edge, legs dangling in, and pushes herself into the water-accomplished w/a forward push of her buttocks. If the pool otherwise had metal ladders, going in via the side would be easier on the knees and back than narrow pool stairs.3) The fact that Claire doesn't lay down in the car for pain reasons is specifically addressed when they cross back over the border from Tijuana.My assumption was, because of her horrible/bloody memories of the accident, Claire couldn't bear to look through a car windshield.Like Claire, I was once thrown out of a chronic pain support group. Except I was thrown out for the opposite reason. Lol. It was a pretty furious group...Claire would have fit right in."
" Incredible performance by Jennifer Aniston. Worth Watching
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,8,"I went into this movie knowing nothing, just hearing the name pop up in conversations and not really knowing what the plot was about. When I watched the move, I got sucked in. To sum it up, the plot is slow, and kind of uneventful....but, 5 years later, I still remember 2 things very intensely:
1) Jennifer's acting was so good....so heavy...I still remember the tone, the feeling of the movie years later (if you've watched Darren Aronofsky's Requiem for a dream, you'll understand)
2) The movie is extremely depressing, but somehow you end the movie liking it because the character growth seems hopeful.
I definitely recommend watching it."
" Strongly heartfelt and greatly acted
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,8,"This is not an easy film to watch, especially on a hot summer day, but at the end I felt at ease and grateful.
Cronic physical and emotional pain is a hard topic, but the both intense and delicate way it was dealt with made the picture sustainable although emotionally gripping. The two parallel stories develop side by side and lead to deep involvement. Acting was great, I had never seen Jennifer Aniston play such a dramatic and difficult role, but she proves capable of a highly committed dramatic performance. All the cast is well drawn and offer heartfelt and high level acting. Despite the highly dramatic content, every single scene and dialogue are carefully under control as not to get to melodramatic or naÃ¯ve, and all the cast reveal a solid direction. That's what I appreciated most and why I recommend it."
" One of the less accessible Oscar contenders of its year due to the heavy, dark content but stick with it
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,8,"Cake follows Clare, a reluctant member of a support group for chronic pain sufferers who becomes fixated with the suicide of another member (Anna Kendrick) while refusing to work on her own rehabilitation.Jennifer Aniston's performance as chronic pain sufferer, Clare, has been overlooked at all major awards ceremonies so far and she's been dealt a final cruel blow by being snubbed from even a nomination at this month's Oscars.While the masses mourn her losses, a closer look at Cake reveals her strong but not outstanding performance was buoyed by an outstanding story, supporting cast and cinematography.
Cake is slow and sad yet gripping and shocking.Clare's physical pain is immediately apparent, as is her short temper and seemingly life-long attitude problem, but the slow unravelling of why she hates her husband, why her long-suffering housekeeper refuses to quit and her obsession with the suicide case is surprisingly devastating.
Surprising because, for the majority of the film, Clare is a hateful character, yet when she makes those painful small steps towards accepting her own past, and in turn revealing it to us, all is forgiven and more.Cake is one of the less accessible Oscar contenders due to the heavy, dark content but stick with it and you'll see the lightness and positivity shrouded by the tragic mood."
" Movie for adults who have lived a little
",2019-07-06 00:00:00,8,"If you're old enough to have lost, grieved, felt pain, struggled, you will be rewarded by this movie.
It's not easy creating a character that remains compelling for an entire movie with such a quiet performance but Aniston pulls it off. Aniston has been a victim of her success on Friends to the point where she keeps getting recycled through one stupid rom-com after another. Be grateful somebody saw dramatic potential in her.
What you won't find in Cake are big revelations or acting histrionics. No yelling or fist fights. Well, there's one little scene with W. H. Macy but that hardly counts and thankfully the moviemakers don't turn it into a MOMENT Of CATHARSIS. In fact, it goes away unmentioned almost as quickly as it happened.
Really, most of what ''happens"" unfolds in our imaginations, where we fill in the blanks from our own life experiences. I think that's why ADHD millennials probably don't like this movie. They haven't lived outside their iPhones or felt anything other than being unfriended on Crackbook.
This is a movie by adults for adults."
" A look into a life of pain.
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,7,"A little bit ""after-school special"", but still does an OK job of highlighting the struggles of chronic pain, suicide, and painkiller addiction.
I can only imagine what that pain must feel like. The days after a 14er climb I certainly feel sore, but at least I know it will go away soon. To live with a pain that might never go away must be agony."
" If you're dealing with grieve, this might be a good one for you
",2019-04-04 00:00:00,10,"Jennefer's best movie so far, very emotional, very real.
Losing someone is very hard. In this movie we join Jennefer's journey into healing.
Cried alot!"
" The plot could have been better
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,6,"I only watched this movie because Jennifer Aniston is in it and it's her only serious movie that doesn't involve comedy. She portrayed her character with physical pains really well and it felt believable. Unfortunately, I felt that the plot was average as there was no real story and I felt it just dragged along. I wish it actually told us more details of the accident or the aftermath at the beginning in the movie which would definitively make the movie a bit more intriguing. There was also not any moments in the movie where i felt emotional and not enough intense scenes which a movie like this needs. I can see why the movie bombed in the box office and why the distributors were reluctant to release it in many theatres. Overall the movie was ok, but I felt it lacks the intriguing and engaging moments with the audience."
" Just okay
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,3,"Jennifer Aniston is not a great actress to begin with and in Cake I guess this is her "" trying "" to be Claire . There's just something missing in her performance and just not there . Too cliche on a serious subject and I really wanted her to be great in this movie. Not enough reality and REAL depth to her character . Sorry to say it doesn't feel real. And I believe this is reality in the way of how many of these "" stars "" really actually look without ALL the makeup artists and Hollywood perfection that they are treated to . I do have to say it was probably very brave to go on the big screen makeup and hair like many every day women who are real in life ."
" Jennifer Aniston is a load bearing column..
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,6,Jennifer Aniston is a load bearing column in an otherwise structurally unsound construct - all the right ingredients seem to be there but the overall result comes off as if not fully baked.
" Jennifer Aniston is awful
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,2,"Worst performance of a bad and untalented weak actress as always.
Anna Kendrick and everyone else is great. Jennifer Aniston is Bad, worse and Worst as always."
" Jennifer Aniston Bad as always
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,2,"Jennifer Aniston Never performs beyond ""mehh OK"". I know she has lot of connections and gets told and powerful support but she never ever... honestly almost never played any role well... not even ""mediocre"".
But it's not about how good and talented you are in Hollywood. It's all about who you know, and I guess she knows many...
Bad bad actress. Always bad."
" It's more then Cake
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,8,"I don't know why this movie named Cake but i know that the movie is good as a delicious cake, also there is a deep sad and black drama in this movie."
" An amalgam of sorrow and pain.
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,8,"This is an insightful look into patients with chronic pain through drama and black comedy. This movie focuses on one case, which is performed by actress Jennifer Anniston (amazingly done) and her struggle to cope with pain to the point where she daydreamed about ending her life, but she fought and kept going. The film touches upon many aspects of mentally or emotionally ill people, but chiefly concentrates on their suffering and demonstrates the state of compunction they are in without even being guilty; it really elucidates that, and somewhat justifies the purposes behind their suicidal mindset lastly, I would like to let you know that if you're not into these types you will be regretting it because you won't get it and therefore you won't enjoy it."
" A Great Movie if Its Your Experience
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,9,"6 March 2017. Cake is one of those movies that needs to find its audience. Beginning in a most difficult of genres, drama plain and simple, Cake struggles to find a wide audience which is probably not going to happen. The movie's basic premises are essentially plain and simple, oddly enough ripped out of ordinary life. Yet it is for this very simple life comes the terrible complexity of real life's tragedies and their aftermath.The movie is slow, is ponderously plodding, and yet for those who can appreciate its subtle and sometimes vivid exploration of physical pain, of authentic physical appearance of Jennifer Anniston in a brave and powerfully performed character, and a case study of grief and loss and anger and acceptance in bursts of intensity and at the same time small steps, then this movie is a standout, much like Lost in Translation (2003). For the very fact, that this movie is capable of sustaining any interest at all and revealing the raw reality of living as though deadened and sickened of life, even with the dry humor covering for a sense of dulling the pain, the movie excels. There is at the end no amazing breakthrough, but only a sense of an incremental candle of hope.Other resonating movies of the same tone and perspective include Days of Wine and Roses (1962) about alcoholism, Margot at the Wedding (2007) about dysfunctional families, Jarhead (2005) about war, Unreal. ""The Official Handbook for Starting Over (2004) about romantic relationships or even Stranded (2001) about survival on another planet."
" Best You'll Ever See of Aniston..
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,8,"Not a big Jen fan, but I have to say she did a fantastic job in this. I think if it had been yet another ""overacted"" Kidman or that annoying chick from LaLa they'd have been hurling awards for this performance. Def worth a watch especially if you've ever known true debilitating back pain, you'll totally get this."
" WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY TO NINA
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,8,"Claire Bennett (Jennifer Aniston) lives in chronic pain. She has scars and we can only guess as to what happened until about an hour into the film when we discover our guess is correct. The film has very little plot as it shows us Claire coping with pain. She is well off and has a house keeper (Adriana Barraza) who tolerates her illegal activities to obtain pain killers. She has alienated her husband and got kicked out of her support group. Nina (Anne Kendrick) was a member of the support group who has committed suicide, a concept Claire entertains. Claire sees and communicates with Anne Kendrick in her hallucinations and dreams, which were far from the dreams I have of Anne Kendrick.The film takes a sympathetic view to people addicted to pain killers. I think most of us know of someone who for some reason or another love their pain killers dangerously too much. This film is considered a coming out party for Aniston who has been criticized for her frequent Razzie performances. To her credit Aniston played the role well and a giant step in the right direction. Clearly she played a woman who couldn't sit in a chair long enough to get her hair done. As far as the Oscar hype, I though Hilary Swank was far better as an ALS patient (You're not You) and she didn't even get a nod.Certainly worth a view, particularly for fans of Oxicon.Guide: F-bomb, brief sex. No nudity"
" Why low ratings?
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,8,"It's easy to believe that Jennifer Aniston is not the best actress, although she can be good at comedies she has done for years. Therefore I was so pleasantly surprised at her in this movie. Because this is her movie. It is she who does this good, trustworthy and engaging. Human trauma has many sides. With her interpretation in this film, she produces a woman who really struggles in everyday life, and she shows it both with humor and seriousness. I hope she will get more such roles in the future, she will do very well. And it's too bad that she in most of the movies she has done in recent years, not giving her more to unfold. We would love to see more of this!"
" Brilliant
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,9,Don't listen to the crappy reviews. This movie is PHENOMENAL.
" Thank you, Jennifer A
",2018-06-03 00:00:00,9,"Jennifer Aniston is perfect. Movie, just about. Great job."
" Jennifer Aniston.. wow
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,10,"This movie is very well done. I feel that Jennifer Aniston without a doubt was the perfect actress for the role and her performance on this piece of art speaks tons about her abilities. I feel that the story was missing but nevertheless it is very raw, discusses an important topic and I feel it shows us how important attitude can be.If you have not seen this movie yet you should see it at least to see how convincing and professional Jennifer Aniston can be. Adriana Barraza was also excellent. This is beautiful art."
" Unrelenting Darkness
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,6,Despite a daring performance from Jennifer Aniston (though ultimately one-note) the movie fails to take off. It's the screenplay. It's the unrelenting darkness and pessimism. Maybe fewer hallucinations and more flashbacks to happier times would have helped.
" An exploration of pains
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,9,"Like many others who have commented on this piece before, I was never a fan of Rachel, and that dislike naturally affected my perception and judgment of -- as well as expectations toward -- Aniston and her work. The portrayal of Claire caused some massive adjustments, which makes me really joyous. Aniston's character in Cake is interesting and convincing in so many ways, and it gives food for thought in so many aspects -- it makes you wonder what alternative path(s) as an actress she might have taken in the absence of Friends. But never mind all that. Here's hoping (and now also very much expecting -- yeah, revealing one's talent can be a real curse) that we'll get a lot more of THAT actress in the future.The development of Claire's character, and thus the film as such, progresses at a good pace. Don't be turned off by claims that the first half is too slow, it absolutely isn't. Portraying the many facets of pain that represent Claire's reality couldn't possibly be done more quickly, it would be entirely inappropriate. In fact, I assume the director had a lot more material in that section which he was forced to cut to appeal to a broader audience (which is a real shame).Similarly, don't be misled by claims that much of the first part of Cake is a '(self-)pity party'. Whoever spouts such nonsense simply lacks any experience of what chronic pain is like. In a sense, such people are to be admired and congratulated because they seem to have lived rather luckily. On the down-side, lack of personal experience comes with lack of true understanding and empathy, which is unfortunate. If anything, it's rather amazing that Claire manages to operate as well as she does. Many, perhaps most, others in her position wouldn't. That she is snarky and short in her interaction with others cannot possibly surprise, constant pain does that to a person.I also liked that the full spectrum of pains was not revealed immediately. We slowly learn that chronic bodily misery is not the only part of Claire's hell. Rather, psychological pains -- and here too, not just one kind -- represent key aspects of the character's daily experience of 'life'. Over the course of the film, more and more agony gets packed on, making you wonder how she's even able to manage anything other than a crawl. In this respect, I actually found the weakness of her suicidal tendencies (as portrayed) quite unconvincing. How could anyone not strongly wish to put an end to this kind of suffering?? (Religion certainly didn't seem to play a preventative role.)One key question that I wish the film would have had time to consider is how relatively lucky Claire is despite her personal hell. Imagine the same fate had affected not Claire -- who's obviously materially well-off -- but rather her housekeeper Silvana. If Claire's life is agony, what would the existence of an immigrant be like?All in all, much applauded and recommended."
" The movie Cake actually has nothing to do with cake
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,9,"Jennifer Aniston is known for her iconic role as Rachel Green from the TV classic, Friends. Her lead roleâClaireâin the 2014 drama Cake, is a far cry from what Aniston is used to portraying. While watching a drama, I expect there to be conflict throughout the story and experiencing a mix of emotions. I usually don't cry while watching movies, but when I watched Cake, I was pleasantly surprised to find myself getting teary-eyed.The storyline revolves around a grieving woman, Claire, following her journey of overcoming the many obstacles brought forward in her life after being involved in a fatal car accident. Claire struggles with a chronic pain disorder and pain pill addiction, for which she has an at-home nurse, Silvana, and an addiction/support group. The film starts out with Claire in an addiction meeting: they are discussing the recent tragedy of their peer, Nina, who had recently commit suicide. Claire feels obligated to bond with Nina's family because of the direct similarities between their stories, and goes out of her way to do so. Seeing Claire struggle both physically and emotionally with her new life is heartbreaking and all you can do is empathize for her pain. The only issue I have with this movie is that it doesn't make sense until the end. I was very confused as to why Claire was doing certain things, but by the end everything made perfect sense. Over all I give this movie 9 stars. I would definitely recommend it to others and will for sure be watching it again."
" Good character study of a woman dealing with emotional and physical trauma
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,7,"If you have every known someone who was badly injured in an accident or lost someone, you will probably relate to the subject matter of this film. Someone close to me was badly injured in a car accident, and I remember how difficult it could be to watch her deal with severe depression, physical pain, and humiliation throughout her recovery process. There were times when I just wanted her to pretend to be getting better because it could be so draining to watch her cry, curse, shut down, and think about death and blame. Jennifer Aniston does a very good job portraying all these different aspects of the recovery process. There's the physical pain, the abusive language towards others - even the ones who care for her, and the blame and self-harm. Some might describe her as a ""bitch"" but pay attention and think about things from her perspective.As a fan of Six Feet Under, I enjoyed the hallucinations of the suicide victim and the dark humor in those scenes. I also enjoyed the development of a friendship with the suicide victim's husband. It felt well-paced and believable. Most of all, I liked the friendship between Claire and her maid. The subject matter may be a bit depressing for some, but if you enjoy a good character study and are even the slightest bit interested in the perspective of a person dealing with severe trauma, I would recommend this film. It might even help you deal with a similar situation or that of a loved one."
" Electrifying performance from Jennifer Aniston
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,7,"Cake is the story of a woman named Claire (Jennifer Aniston) grieving and recovering from the terrible aftermath of a horrific accident. This movie is different due to the fact that it never shows directly what tragedy struck Claire.The audience is left to deduce that by collecting pieces from her current activities and attitude. What we see is a not so young, terribly irritable and sometimes viciously rude woman who is in chronic pain, addicted to pain killing drugs whose marriage is over, seems wealthy and has no need to go to work. She goes to support groups and therapies but is not liked anywhere and she doesn't care. Supporting her way beyond her expected duties is her housekeeper. A God fearing Mexican lady who drives her around, puts up with her tantrums and genuinely cares about her. The movie dwells on the daily regimen and broken personality of Claire for a long time before we finally gather what happened. She obsesses over the suicide of Nina (ANa Kendric) from her chronic pain supporting group. She blackmails the therapist to get Nina's details and reaches out to her family thereby starting to take a step forward towards healing. The best part of this movie is the absolute and amazing performance by Jennifer Aniston and Adriana Barraza. I have mainly seen Aniston in quirky comedy movies. Her performance here as a lady coping with the outcomes of an accident is a pleasure to watch. Barraza was equally fabulous as the overworked,taken for granted, empathetic Silvana who cared like a mother for her sick employer. I like the fact about the script that the audience is forced to think but the movie dwells too long on building on Claire's character and thus the later half of the movie becomes malnourished. Around the first half when i was getting almost impatient the story moves forward from the scowl on Claire's face. But the friendship between Ninas husband and Claire although understandably platonic lacks depth. It doesn't spend much time on how they affect each other to heal.Somehow the director failed to treat this part with more maturity and depth. Sam worthington as a single grieving father suitably underacted. His character could have been given more meat though. Overall i quite liked the film."
" The Best Performance of Aniston's Career
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,7,"I never thought much of Jennifer Aniston as an actress, she always makes her character essentially Rachel from Friends and Hollywood has always cast her accordingly. That is not the case in Cake. Aniston shines as Claire Bennett, a woman constantly enveloped in pain, both physical and emotional. Rather than deal with her problems, she tries to hide from them by abusing painkillers and being a complete and total b***h to everyone. Following the suicide of a member of her support group (which Claire is asked to leave due to her negative impact on the group), Claire eventually begins to heal after befriending the woman's family and having hallucinatory conversations with the dead woman.Aniston shows another level that few thought she had in this role much like Charlize Theron in Monster. Aniston really becomes a woman for whom every single step is pain. Adriana Barraza also delivers an excellent performance as her housekeeper Silvana, who does everything she can to help Claire heal. Sam Worthington, Anna Kendrick, Britt Robertson, Felicity Huffman, and a brief appearance from William H. Macy round out a solid supporting cast in this surprisingly good drama."
" Gives desserts a bad name
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,1,"Please, give Jennifer Aniston an Oscar already. If only so she can stop making movies like this one. If you watch the preview, it's pretty obvious she wanted a nomination. If you watch the movie, you'll think to yourself, ""Oh man, she really looks like she's in pain!"" for about five minutes. Then, turn it off. Trust me.Aniston plays a woman who's been in an accident and is in constant, terrible pain. But before you feel sorry for her and hand her that gold statue, know this: throughout the entire movie, she makes bad choice after bad choice, and she's not likable in the slightest. The story is simultaneously boring and frustrating. And where did the acting go? Aniston's press agent spent a season touting her acting in preparation for the nomination she didn't receive, but the finished product doesn't show any of it.If you want to see someone with back pain, rent The Answer Man. It's much more enjoyable. Cake is terrible. Frankly, it gives desserts a bad name."
" Great acting
",2017-05-05 00:00:00,10,"Aniston did an excellent portrayal of a woman in big, chronic pain. Both emotional and physical, and when the meds were and weren't working. She should win awards for her acting. I hope others who see the film, think of the people in their lives that have chronic pain, and understand even just a bit of what they are going thru. The scenes where she can barely breathe because of the pain are bang on, or when in bed and can hardly move due to the pain. Even the sounds she makes ""when in pain"" are exactly right. The way she turns without moving her head and the way she stands up are perfect. The weariness of dealing with the pain is so real looking."
" A little disappointed
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,6,"As a chronic pain sufferer myself I was a little disappointed to slightly angry with this movie. With all the challenges chronic pain sufferers are going through at this time, this movie makes sufferers out to be drug seeking, illegal doing, grouches that do nothing but deal with pain. Not an image we need right now! I take care of my kids, do housework and errands. Go out with friends and live everyday like it may be my last. Yes I'm in pain but I won't let it control me and I only take what is prescribed to me. The movie itself was well done but I really am afraid it will stereotype pain sufferers."
