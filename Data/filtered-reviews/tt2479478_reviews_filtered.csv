" This is my Burro.
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,6,"If you were expecting something incredible,, well, you obviously aren't familiar with Happy Madison. This is just dumb fun from Sandler and company."
" Adam is losing it...
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,1,"This movie was not a comedy but a pathetic tragedy; Adam Sandler used to be very funny. But sadly he is losing it--in my opinion. His scripts are quite pathetic. Dumbing down of Americans. There is funny--and there is ""losing it"" This is the later."
" so funny
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,10,I laughed wen de donky pooped on teh wall. haha i said wen de donky .
" Sandler to a tee
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,8,Good cast with lots of silliness. If you like happy madison productions then you know what to expect. Easy to watch when you just want to chill and chuckle.
" It's a fanastic comedy
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,10,"I can't understand the bad reviews for this. The movie is (in my humble opinion) exactly what Adam Sandler does best: make you laugh so hard that it hurts.If you're expecting *serious cinema* go watch some Sundace crap. If you want to laugh like you're still in middle school, you can't do much better than this.10/10 -- time well-spent!"
" Dreadful 6
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,1,"One word.... 'Woeful'
Time better spent would be reorganising your sock drawer...."
" Laughed so hard
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,9,"I cried I laughed so hard at this movie , I swear people are loosing their sense of humour if they don't think this movie was funny"
" Funny!
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,8,Haven't laughed that hard in a minute. Naysayers can suck it!
" It's a kind movie
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,8,It's a kind funny movie. It is kind a comedy. The good wins üòÅ
" Typical
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,10,Either you love his work or you dont. There is no middle with sandler and his band of friends. So in closing i tip my hat to the cast and crew. Job well done
" Don't expect to much
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,5,Turn off your brain and find something to read while watching this movie and you may enjoy it
" I Liked It
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,7,"The first time I watched this movie I hated it... not gonna lie. But for some reason I watched it over again 2 years later and I actually really enjoyed it. It's a typical (dumb) comedy and I was laughing at things that I didn't laugh at last time. Don't take this movie seriously... it's meant to be quirky and stupid... and if you can let go of being too serious, you'll really enjoy it."
" Funnier each time you watch it!!
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,7,"Absolutely ridiculous, as the title suggests, and didn't enjoy it much the first time around but the second time.. I was in stitches!!"
" Majestic White Knife
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,3,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Greetings all...after going through dramatic roles in the few months, its time to change the tune and hit some Sandman comedy...that's right, I will be hitting up Adam Sandler movie for the next monthToday's movie review is Western comedy The Ridiculous 6 (2015) where the Sandman plays Tommy aka White Knight, who was raised by the Native American when his mother was murdered. Tommy has an unexpected visit from his long-lost father, Frank Stockburn played by Nick Nolte, who is unexpectedly is kidnapped by a group of outlaws the next day. Tommy sets himself on a quest to save his dad and along the way he meets 5 half-brothers. I won't go through the whole cast or the flick, this movie is funny stupid but more stupid. Heaps of cameos and stars who star in a predictable film which portrays insulting themes around obvious stereotypes. Loads of corny routines and obvious gags but the treatment of women as nothing more than objects takes a toll. The standouts of the film include John Turturro as Abner Doubleday, the man who apparently came up baseball. The scene is amusing especially when Turturro literately makes up the rules of the game as he goes along just so he doesn't loose. Another funny moment includes Steve Zahn who plays a bandit later in the movie is hilarious. Other then that, it's not the worst film I have watched and if you are a Sandler fan then this rootin-tootin outlaw flick may be your thing. It definitely wasn't mine. I can see why this flick killed Taylor Lautner's career. Overall, 3/10"
" Bottom of the barrel!
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,1,"After finishing ""The Ridiculous 6"" I felt that my soul had transcended into a being of pure light energy; able to withstand even the crappiest of comedies. So I suppose if I took anything away from this film, that was it."
" Nice Movie!!
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,10,"What's wrong with people?? THIS IS SUCH A NICE MOVIE. Might not be Oscar worthy but this one doesn't deserve low rating. Anyway, love it!!"
" It's Not That Bad
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,7,"I watched this movie for the first time about 4 years ago and it was enjoyable.
Its got some funny jokes and scenes in it, I don't understand the incredibly low rating."
" Ridiculously funny
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,9,"I don't get what's up everyone's bum! My partner and I laughed pretty much from start to finish. Yes it was ridiculous, but that's literally in the tittle so those ho don't like ridiculous perhaps stay away! If you aren't too PC, enjoy a bit of stupidity, have an appreciation for Adam sanders wit and want a good belly laugh, this is for you."
" Not bad
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,7,I thought this will use pretty good Adam sandberg and Rob Schneider Georgie Garcia. He was kind of a satire comedy Western little brawl I liked my recommended Terry Crews is also in this as his mcnulty will forte.
" What is wrong with people!
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,10,"This is actually a nice film for what it is. From the reviews, I actually thought the jokes and the whole film will be very goofy. It is not! Honestly, this is a good film. Don't be discouraged by the ridiculously low score."
" Not that bad and half-funny
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,7,"It's not a masterpiece but I'd say is an underrated movie.
A lot of great actors play a good part in it being really decent.
Some of the jokes were pretty funny, the esthetics were good and it wasn't boring.
For a comedy, I'd say that this deserves a watch before you judge it based on these way too low marks it has got here."
" Surprisingly enjoyable.
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,10,"If u are a normal movie enthusiast, not a critic, and just want to enjoy a movie; have fun and watch this. Don't get why critics give this too low of a score, why are they trying other ""normal"" people to enjoy a good movie like this? Like less than 5 out 10? This must be at least 6. Like what the hell, be fair! There are a lot of movies out there that is really below 5. Not this one!! You critics, should just go to rotten tomatoes, give any score u want, cause I dont go there for review. But please dont take a away good movies like this from us. Good thing my husband was watching this, and I just took a look, after 5 mins I got hooked. I got here to check how this movie scores in IMDB because I really enjoyed it. But got dissapointed seeing the score. A lot of reviewers here are the ridiculous ones. Writing a review for the very first time here, to support this movie. Please help pull up the score!"
" Adam Sandler doing what he does....Zohan in the old west...
",2020-09-11 00:00:00,7,A funny and entertaining movie with Sandler and his gang of misfits.... if you enjoyed Zohan and like Sandler's over the top humour then you'll be entertained with this one... don't expect some deep and meaningful epic here and just go along for the ride and enjoy the movie for what it is.

" Feel Good Movie
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,10,"This movie is fun. Hands down my favorite role Taylor Lautner has played. His hanging scene had us rewinding and rewatching over and over with tears and belly laughs pouring out. So many King's and Queen's of comedy in this and some fun cameos. I'd love to see the outtakes for this one! Sandler's character reminded me Zohan quips and cinematic stunts. Don't take this movie too seriously and just enjoy it for its intended purpose, to put a smile on your face."
" I will try not to curse.
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,1,"Adam Sandler has always been hit or miss with me. But this was a miss in a big big way. This ""movie"" did not illicit a single laugh or giggle. Taylor Lautner commits career suicide in a horrifically embarrassing performance.
If you watch this, don't blame me."
" the donkey and the injans
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,8,"Normally I skip Adam Sandler movies because comedy or humor coming out the USA isn't mostly not my cup of tea. And just before this one I 've seen a comedy that was high rated but one I found total crap. So i didn't know if this was going to be my thing.Clocking in at 2 hours it really has to be good to make it worth seeing for 2 hours and yes, I did like it and yes, Ilaughed it out loud sometimes, stupid simple situtaions that makes it slapstick style or even just funny. The beginning, injans in stead of Indians, yep, that already worked out for me. And the donkey, men, hilarious.
Sure, it do has it flows, the cricket moment is maybe a bit too long but overall, I enjoyed it a lot and hey, Adam Sandler is on my list now.Gore 0/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 2/5
Story 3/5
Comedy 2,5/5"
" Yes, I gave this movie an 8.
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,8,"Do I like Adam Sandler? Yes. Do I like all his movies... No!! I am a fan of the more ""refined"" Sandler movies: Wedding Singer, Big Daddy, 50 First Dates, Just Go With It, Spanglish, Bedtime Stories and even Grown Ups. I am not one for loud and silly obnoxious- though I did watch all of ""Jack & Jill"" with a cringe. I enjoy Sandler's creativity though often feel like in his younger years he needed less middle school humor, but that was the decade of the 1990's and a run off of his SNL days. This movie is silly but genuinely funny and surprisingly entertaining!! What also elevates the story is the cast members- well known stars who are genuinely funny!. Who knew the gap toothed dimly lit sidekick was the ""Twilight"" heartthrob wolf ""Jacob"" ?!
This movie had laughs, some unique Fictional characters mixed in with historical favorites. (Mark Twain poker party was my favorite.) It was not predictable, no gore or foul language and peppered with laughs and famous faces. It's a good time. I have watched it several times. I wish there was a ""Ridiculous 6.5"" but, you most often cannot recreate genius. ""Left Eye Gang"".. üòÇ"
" Young Dumb and Full of It
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,2,"Of course, we always had The Magnificent Seven (John Sturges, 1960). Well, not always, but since 1960. More recently, Quentin Tarantino gave us The Hateful 8. As everyone knows, The Three Musketeers (some 25 film versions, of which Fred Niblo's 1921, Alan Dwan's 1939, George Sydney's 1948 and Richard Lester's 1973 are the MacMahonianest) were 4, John Ford gave us Two Rode Together (1962) and Lazlo Benedek The Wild One (1953). I don't know what happened to 9 and 10 (Blake Edwards, 1979) and The Ten Commandments (Cecil B de Mille, 1923 and 1958) don't really count, for this purpose. But anyway, now we do have 6. It's ridiculous.The Ridiculous 6 was the 9th feature film directed by Frank Coraci, director of 2nd to 3d rate light comedies et pour cause frequently behind the camera in Adam Sandler vehicles.The Ridiculous 6 tells the story of the eponymous, offspring sired by ageing bank robber Frank Stockburn (Nick Nolte, in autopilot) from 6 different mothers and consisting of a former Abraham Lincoln bodyguard who needed to go to the bathroom for a moment while in the theatre with Abe, in the course of which digression he actually gave directions to Abe's theatre booth to John Wilkes Booth, thus nursing a guilt complex the size of US history (Luke Wilson), a round-faced droopy mustachioed sombreroed half-Mexican (Rob Schneider), a Neanderthal fur-catcher (Jorge Garcia), a somewhat incongruous hillbilly dimwit (Taylor Lautner), a black man (Terry Crews) and Adam Sandler. The ridiculous are on a quest to procure 50.000 USD to pay off dad's robbing debts, thus embarking in a series of low-brow comedic endeavours and accidents.The history of the moronic western comedy, at least of the deliberate variety, goes back at least to the Three Stooges (Goofs and Saddles, Del Lord, 1936), or, if one wants to stick to feature length efforts, to Abbot and Costello (Ride 'em Cowboy, Arthur Lubin, 1942). But long doesn't mean illustrious, and The Ridiculous 6 gives the impression of not even trying to escape the curse. Gags and puns are low and lazy, and one wonders how Nolte and Sandler ever consented to be involved in the project.Everyone has to earn a living, I guess."
" not as painful as I had imagined
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,5,"Perhaps my vision has been clouded by the lovely uncut gems, but this is one of sandler's less awful movies. if you're looking for one of his movies where he doesn't yell too much this one's your guy. yeehaw"
" One of the funniest westerns
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,6,A hilarious cast of characters that make the story a seriously funny ordeal of senarios. Might not be the most laughable comedy but defenently lives up to the Sandler Comedy films.
" Sorta lives up to the ensemble cast
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,4,"Just the melodrama schmaltz is a bit much, otherwise the style of joking is actually good, the all star cast for this movie is also fine - the movie just for the schmaltz portions is attempting to make it somehow legitimate as a movie since they do not want it to be totally cartoonish, however should have just upped the comedy portions instead, movie's not as bad as other all-star cast movies however, 3/5."
" An easy going goodtime!
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,8,"Just not sure why anyone would hate on this. Guess maybe it's the cultural appropriating haters just hating. This was lighthearted fun with an all star cast. It's an adam sandler movie so you should kinda be knowing what you're getting into at this point. so if you liked the old school ""happpy maddison"" flicks you'll appreciate this one too.One thing i wanted to bring up though is in another review someone said something about this being a ""family film"" and not sure about that one though.... It's got a lot of sexual references that i'm not thinking are suitable for ""kids"".. now if your family is all ""of age"" and laid back then yeah, great ""family film"" but it aint no disney! :) and that's what makes it cool. peace!"
" Not funny
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,1,Was it supposed to be funny? So disappointing. Couldn't even finish it. Soooo bad.
" To hell with the critics
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,8,"I am finding more and more that I do not trust movie critics anymore. I throughly enjoyed this movie. I find that if a movie critic dislikes a movie, it probably means I will feel the opposite. This movie made me laughter out loud. One of the reasons I think I enjoyed this movie more than the critics is this reason. A film critic goes to see a movie to critique it. I go to a movie to enjoy it. This means I allow myself to suspend reality, not care about breaks in timing and don't look for actors to try and win an academy award. I just let the movie play and go where it takes me. This movie takes me to a lot of funny places."
" Absolutely hilarious!
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,8,This was a hilarious movie. The dialog was incredibly clever and sometimes highly subtle. I was quite impressed. And the story is quite good for a comedy such as this. The number of actors in disguise is hugely fun; you'll find yourself guessing over and over as to whom they all are. This one is definitely worth watching.
" Absolutely hilarious!
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,8,"This movie has some of the most clever lines and plot twists you can imagine. The humor ranges from the quite intelligent to the hardcore thigh slappers. The movie is quite touching, too. The cast is fantastic. Watch this one, for sure."
" Better than I expected
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,7,"It's an Adam Sandler movie with a lot of cameos. Yeah, some of it doesn't make sense, and some of it it just plain rediculous (see what I did there?), but overall it was very entertaining. Blazing Saddles it ain't, but it's still pretty good."
" Funny
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,6,Classic Adam Sandler comedy and the western setting enhances thr film. I didn't like the ending of the film dragging on just to include an action scene. Since this is a comedy movie the action that is typical of a western isn't necessary and the twist is so predictable that it nearly ruins the entire movie. There is also a bestiality joke that is a small moment but left a bad taste. Other than that it is a great movie even when compared to the other contemporary Happy Madison movies that are adults only.
" One Of Those Movies You Must Have A Sense Of Humor To Enjoy!
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,9,I am not going to give any spoilers away in this review. It is just a funny movie unless you are a Politically Correct type of person. I am not a huge fan of Adam Sandler and a couple of other actors in this movie however after I got into this movie I was laughing so hard I felt intoxicated. It is full of stereotypes that are now inappropriate for the masses and it just shows how much our attitudes have been changed for the worse as we have become too sensitive about EVERYTHING!We have watched this six or seven times and it never seems to get old. I think it is a terrible environment we are currently living in with everyone being offended by stereotypes. If you cannot laugh at yourself you should not laugh at others and probably should not watch this movie. One reviewer compares this to Western Saddles which is an incredible Iconic Movie that is far worse As far a stereotypes and words that are considered far more inappropriate than this film. It has similar satire but Western Saddles is a classic movie that you might have a hard time watching in our modern day overly sensitive world. Luckily we have a couple of copies of Western Saddles.I agree that there is nothing funny about slavery or slurs towards other nationalities that are depicted in this film. As a gay man I hear this kind of crap all the time and people find it hilarious. Does it bother me? Absolutely not. I am generally laughing just as hard as others are. We need to treat each other like equals but there is no reason why we cannot laugh at our own selves as we all have a sense of humor and we should not forget the plight of others but we should not have to be so sensitive about everything that is not politically correct either! I guess what I am trying to say is that we should be past the hatred of others who are different and come from different countries as we are all basically the same. Human beings. Just because we laugh at things that might be considered inappropriate for some should not be taken so seriously. We mostly have progressed from that terrible period in time and if we let it hold us back we will never get any further in our short lives or have equality for all. I think being a comic or a comedian is probably the hardest job that anyone in the entertainment industry could pursue.
" Maybe I'm imature
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,7,"Well I thought it was funny and I new I wouldn't be the only one, people shouldn't take this kind of film so seriously and just go along for the ride.
I noticed that most of the negative reviews were from people who don't like mr S. interesting!
Why do the people who are so negative think they are an expert on films and have to come out with long winded drivel on why (they think) it's so bad? Also interesting."
" Ridiculous fun and I loved it!
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,10,"So many bad reviews! It's just a silly fun film and I loved it.
Some of the jokes fell a little flat at the beginning but generally it's a typical sander film with some great famous faces.
Don't take it seriously it's just a bit of slapstick fun."
" Meh film. Stupid but enjoyable to a level
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,4,"Wasn't expecting it to be a great film because it's a comedy and it's Adam Sandler and the combination of those 80% gives you cringe absurd silly films.This film is enjoyable to some level. The main character is badass and the story is nice as well.
But it's not a great movie it's meh
stupidness, silly absurd scenes like in Bollywood moviesLele pete is unnecessarythe truth about their father which is that he's a thief which will later betray his sons.After their father betrayed them, tommy had the chance to kill him and he didn't.Lil pete had a girlfriend"
" I'm glad I watched this, only so you don't have to.
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,2,"Sometimes I forget that there's a big difference between a ""B"" movie and a ""bad"" movie, and this is definitely the latter, and I want my two hours back. Actually, it took longer than 2 hours because it was that unbearable I went to bed halfway through, gave it a second run in the morning and realised I would rather be washing the dishes and hanging out the laundry.For a film that's got such a well-known cast - the only real question I can ask is - why did they sign up to this? Okay, the majority of the cast are known for their cringe-worthy comedies anyway but this isn't even cringe-worthy, it's just...boring.The saving grace is a short fight scene with some impressive camera angles (Luke Wilson getting beat up in a bar and manages not to spill his drink) and (an absolutely pointless and shoe-horned) scene where a newly invented game of baseball is played, This scene made me smile considering the first person ever inventing a sport, creating new rules on the spot whilst playing against opponents.The plot is predictable, the CGI is below average, the comedy isn't there - genuinely think I only grinned at ONE point because I like Steve Zahn - and why does Rob Schneider look stoned the entire duration of the film?!Don't waste your time. Go stick Waterboy on instead if you need an Adam Sandler fix."
" A Spoof of a Western that's funny for all of .5 Seconds
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,3,"This is an awful film. The only upside to this movie is that you could make fun of it with friends. Other than with at least 2 friends, I would sooner recommend knocking yourself out before watching this movie. Awful humor, awful effects and awful acting. All of this is done on top of a legendary genre that deserves respect, instead it gets spoofed by people like Adam Sandler."
" Yes its rediculous....
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,8,".... It's right there in the name lol!!!Not sure why the rating is so low, this movie is exactly what its meant to be. In this politically correct world people are just too serious. When was the last time you laughed at yourself for something completely stupid?... This is a completely satirical comedy that was a fun, light watch with a couple of friends while shut indoors. We decided to have a few drinks and try to forget everything that is going on for just a little while. Needless to say this movie fit the bill! Its up there with Mel Brooks and Monty Python as far as we were concerned. Much better than all the movie spoofs of the past 2 decades that are churned out by the bucket load. With an all-star cast all the way around the acting is on point. Its dumb, ridiculous, completely uncouth .... We absolutely loved it!If you can't handle movies like Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles then don't even bother!"
" Accurate title at least...not much else to say about this rubbish
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,5,"Another who's who movie involving lots of Adam Sandler's friends and his favourite returning actors. Now I'll be the first to admit that I cannot stand him or his films. By all accounts he's a decent person and I can't comment on that with any kind of authority, but usually his movies stink. But I guess you know what you're going to get with him. Thankfully, The Ridiculous 6 is slightly better fare than the usual tripe he rolls out.Tommy (Sandler) is a white man raised by the native Americans. Supernaturally quick and skilled, Tommy is due to marry his sweetheart Smoking Fox (yes really). While in camp, Tommy's father (Nolte) arrives to offer peace and ill-gained money to the tribe before it's too late. While there he is seemingly kidnapped by the evil Cicero (a hammy Danny Trejo) and carried off by his gang to obtain the money they believe is rightfully theirs. Tommy despite reservations, sets out to help his dear old pa.It is from here that Tommy begins to understand that his father was quite the philanderer back in his day. He encounters half-brother after brother as he (and then them) come up with ways of finding fifty thousand dollars in order to stop Cicero putting a bullet into their dad. Now unusually (from the Sandler films I have seen) the toilet humour seems to have been kept to a minimum. I'm thankful of that. While I appreciate everyone finds different things funny, I personally grew out of that being funny by my early teens. When it's done properly it can be funny though. Each to their own I guess. Sandler has made a career out of it, so maybe I'm in the minority.Anyway, the brothers are an eclectic mix of weird, wonderful and plain downright odd. Crews, Garcia and Wilson all act well enough but don't have a huge amount to do. The film shines in my opinion due to Schneider and Lautner. I've never really been a fan of Lautner either but he really does excel at playing stupid it seems. Schneider as the Mexican half-brother is also a big highlight. Even Harvey Keitel and Buscemi have fun in their small roles. And this ultimately is what elevates this over other Sandler movies. The cast. Had this been a pure Sandler effort I'm sure this review would have been very different.Ultimately though, the film tries to be too many things. While it is certainly enjoyable it's by no means good. Yes there are a couple of genuinely funny laugh out loud moments, most of the comedy is relatively flat and predictable. And while the title and artwork certainly suggests a parody of Tarantino's Hateful eight and the upcoming (at the time) Magnificent Seven remake (review to come), it actually seemed to me to parody Blazing Saddles more than any of them (which is one of the greatest comedies ever made). Which is funny given that Saddles is a parody film in itself. This wasn't helped by the fact that Nick Swardson tries to to be too much like Slim Pickens and Saginaw Grant (an actual real native American Chief) tries to be far too much like Mel Brooks actual parody of a native American chief. I'm sure there's some irony there somewhere.The film is actually quite well shot if not directed and for the most part everyone plays their part well. The inclusions of friends like Vanilla Ice (try and spot him) and wife Jackie seem forced rather than natural, but I have noticed Sandler tends to draft a lot of his buddies into numerous different films of his. Overall something better than he usually churns out, but still not great. Oh, and I can't wait to see more work from the donkey, who was the real star of the movie.
The Sage's Rating: 5/10"
" I should have cleaned the litterbox or toilet instead...
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,1,"I've liked most Sandler movies but this one ranks (pun intended) down with the lowest Hollywood flops like ""Jack and Jill"", ""Showgirls"" and nearly every cheap attempted re-make like Ghost Busters, Conan the Barbarian, etc...Laughed not once. Felt urge to laugh not once. Attempts at humor were predictable, over-used, strained and desperately throwing feces at the ""comedy wall"" hoping anything would stick. I keep hoping for smarter scripts from him like 50 First Dates, Click, Grown-Ups and The Wedding Singer. Just watch the BEST western spoof ever made, Blazing Saddles, and don't waste your time with this one."

",2020-01-31 00:00:00,7,The movie has very cheesy comedy. It might be to stale and silly for some but I thoroughly enjoyed majority of the movie. The singing scene when all the brothers are singing is one of my favorite scenes across any movie I watched.The ending of the movie is where I struggle to give the movie a high of a rating as I did. For a comedy movie this had one of the worst endings I have ever seen. A backstabbing dad with such serious drama really didn't seem to fit the whole theme of the goofy western comedy. I would give 9/10 if it weren't for the ending.
" One of the worst things I've ever seen...8/10
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,8,"I never want to see it again. Just no. Everything is bad about this movie, from the acting to the writing, the framing to that dang burro. That being said, The Ridiculous 6 succeeds in being hilarious to watch in any scenario, but especially with a large group of people who just want to turn off for a time. The movie's success in That and that reason alone merits a high rating."

" Classic Sandler...Western
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,8,"Just the ticket for leaving holiday political discussions behind for two hours. Politically incorrect, honest, heart-felt fun humor. A great cast, especially the Burro and Rob Schneider, Jorge Garcia and Taylor Lautner. Think about it! Some fine writing and performances."

" Insulting Parody Of Tarantino & Classic Westerns. Netflix Should Demand A Refund From Sandler.
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,1,"Netflix paid a lot of money to Adam Sandler, personally, for future products. Sandler went out and put a film project together, as he normally would - finding producers to fund a film, a writing partner, a location, etc. However, when selecting a theme and writing the script, Sandler deviated from the normal playbook. What Sandler chose to give Netflix was a film HE WANTED TO MAKE, a film that had a lot of negative parody depictions about the history of film and a rival writer/director. However, this is not a film he could have made for a normal distributor, because no one would have paid to see it in theaters. This isn't a film that would have generated mass appeal, because people like old westerns and people like Quintin Tarantino. For the same reasons, this film would have had terrible reviews from media sources that might have wanted to compare it to other new releases in theaters. No, no one would have asked for this film. But, Adam Sandler was paid in advance, so he took advantage of Netflix and handed them a passion project that is an embarrassment to the film industry.I'm not going to list all of the reasons that this is a terrible movie, but I will give one warning to future film makers. Although Adam Sandler thought he was being intellectually clever with some of his jokes (that were probably meant to comment on the depiction of race and culture in film), film writers need to remember that not everyone will understand your jokes. So, when you take chances (over and over again) depicting race and culture in an offensive way, then sometimes you will seem racist. Watching this movie is a very racist experience. 'The Magnificent 7' (1960) was not a racist film. 'The Hateful 8' (2015) was not a racist film. 'The Ridiculous 6' (2015) is a very racist film. And, it's not funny.

" A little opinion but definitely not positive
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,2,It was fully waste of time. I was so much disappointed after watching this movie. This is kinda movie for loser fella. There were no actor whose acting was perfect in this movie. Every actor doing so much overacting. They are all good actor but in this movie they can not perform their natural acting. I don't know why this happened.
" The Ridiculous 6 is unequivocally ridiculously atrocious.
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,1,"Y'know, sometimes I like to think that Adam Sandler gets a bad reputation because of his questionable work in 'Jack and Jill'. I graciously give him opportunities to win me over with his ""charismatic"" charm. But then, for some unknown reason, we get ridiculous tripe like this. A parody of western classics like 'The Magnificent Seven' but with spoofed toilet humour found in 90s teen comedies. Who approved this script? Is there an audience for this abomination? Because sweet Texan lord, this was as ""funny"" as a fly drowning in a glass of water with a donkey exploding its guts onto a wooden wall (actually happens in the film). Urgh. A cool-headed man discovers that his biological father is kidnapped, and coincidentally meets his other five brothers who team up to rescue him.Lazy, offensive, unfunny, terribly directed, atrociously edited and badly performed. I cannot, and will not, find a redeeming factor in this festering pile of excrement, left out in the old western sun. I refuse to bore you with the ridiculous amount of criticisms, so I'll showcase some highlights. The brothers consists of a Mexican burro rider, a mentally challenged exaggerated imbecile, a feral mountain-man who speaks gibberish, the bodyguard of Abraham Lincoln and an African-American pianist. The hilarity, apparently, is that they have nothing in common. Lautner decimates his career even further than 'Twilight' did. Nolte couldn't give a toss. Sandler attempts to imitate his best Clint Eastwood impression, but face plants the dusty road with his monotonous, boring, expressionless performance.A Native American named ""Never Wears Bra"". Really? Sandler continuously conducting forward rolls miraculously transforming into, and I kid you not, a tumbleweed. A twenty minute scene ""hilariously"" recreating the moment Doubleday invented baseball, with Chinese immigrants, which has no place in the plot whatsoever. I can't. I just can't be bothered. It's so irrefutably terrible, that I would advise getting a colonoscopy instead. No more chances Sandler."
" Hilarious till the end
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,10,I'm not a huge fan of Adam Sandler but this movie changed my mind. I've enjoyed it from the beggining till the end.
" Hilariously silly
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,7,"I'm amazed at how this has a 0% on Rotten Tomatoes. Is it really that bad? I don't think so. It's not his best but it's still funny. Obviously it's a parody of the classic the Magnificent Seven. A man adopted by Native Americans named Tommy (Adam Sandler) leaves his tribe to help his father who's accumulated so much debt. Along the way he discovers the 5 brothers he never knew he had:A Mexican burro rider named Ramon (Rob Schneider), The mentally handicapped Lil' Pete (Taylor Lautner), A Mountain Man who speaks unintelligibly named Herm (Jorge Garcia), Former bodyguard of Abe Lincoln named Danny (Luke Wilson) and pianist Chico (Terry Crews) who help him on his quest.What follows are some hilarious scenes and dialogue. A great example's when their father's former gang member tries to kill them as revenge for him stealing his cut only for him to hilariously get his head cut off by Ramon. This leads to his corpse walking and firing a few shots in the air before finally collapsing. The brothers joke about it to death afterwards.Another joke is when Tommy finds out that he has 5 brothers from a woman whom his Dad had a fling with and the detail she goes into explaining when they were together is just hilarious. Another scene is where Ramon's donkey releases a massive load shortly after Ramon and Tommy meet for the first time. According to Ramon that means he likes him. It's gross but in a good way.The characters are likable and funny to watch. They also have enough personality to keep things from getting boring. The historic and pop culture references are funny to watch. There's a scene where Mark Twain (Vanilla Ice) and General Custer (David Spade) meet a casino owner named Ezekiel Grant (Jon Lovitz) and the way they talk modern is just ridiculous. There're moments like that and they're funny to watch.Crazy as it sounds this's actually a good comedy and I highly recommend checking this movie out even if you're not a Sandler fan. Odds are you'll find something funny."
" Stupid funny
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,9,I dont know why people dont like this movie Most Sandler movies are like this so if your a fan you love them I enjoyed it stupid and funny
" Pretty funny!
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,7,If you are looking for a stupid laugh this is pretty good. Vanilla Ice was the best. Definitely worth a few hours of your life.
" Awesome watch
",2019-03-18 00:00:00,8,"Easy to watch comedy, full of stupid funny and a few witty moments. There's s couple of hidden references to other movies which made certain jokes funnier. Some absolutely golden moments that's made it super enjoyable. Worth watching if you need a laugh and don't feel like making your brain work to hard."
" What a comedy!
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,9,"If you cant appreciate this film for what it is pure humour at its finest. I have no words to describe you, I will just hang my head, walk away and pity the world this has become!
I strongly disliked Taylor Lautner in anything before seeing him in this film, but his performance is up there with the best comedy acts of all time!Do yourself a favour and watch this, you will not regret it, and give this film its proper rating!Not a spoiler = wait for Taylor Lautner the hanging!
Pure Genius!!!"
" Solid zero
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,1,"Never thought to give a movie a zero ('1' actually, the system doesn't allow for less)....then I watched this one!Of course I didn't take it seriously, it's an Adam Sadler movie... I went in light hearted and expected to have a little fun.
What I do take seriously though is my time, and that was 119' of neither giggles nor laughter."
" 6 Stars for the Ridiculous 6
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,6,"Surprisingly this flick got several gut laughs from me and quite a few chuckles. I wasn't so sure about this film and I told my wife we'd watch it for a while and could always turn it off. Well it go better as it went on. Lots of humor you had to listen hard to get it. I sure like most comedies that aren't ""romantic comedies"" this is not for everyone. It was fun just identifying all the actors who did cameos. I mean damn, Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain, Blake Sheldon doing Wyatt Earp and David Spade as Custer, I was wanting more screen time for those three. However, Steve Buscemi and a couple others were wasted even as cameos. Overall I liked it 6 times more that the movie is was a parody of, the Quentin Tarantino overrated, ""Hateful Eight"""
" It's funny.
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,9,It's funny. I laughed. You either like this kind of silliness or you don't. I feel sorry for you if you can't laugh at a movie like this
" Bad reviewers suck. It's exactly as you'd suspect from Sandler, why are you surprised??
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,8,I put off watching this for a couple years because of the sad reviewers. Finally watched it and had a ball. It's silly and similar to 'million ways to die in the west' but it's a fun movie and some kooky original ideas. I've been playing heaps of red dead redemption 2 so this was the perfect movie to continue my western faze I'm in. I love all the cameo characters and the weird twist on history. Enjoy it for what it is. It's no 'tombstone' or 'deadwood' but it never tried to be.
" Car crash!!!!
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,1,"As fast as I can, always been a fan of Adam Sandler, he has done some funny entertaining movies this was not one of them!!! Total garbage. I cannot believe it was on for 2 hours had to turn it off at the 1 hour 30 minute mark could not torture myself any longer. To sum it up easily would to just simply call it a CAR CRASH!!!!!"
" I enjoyed it - stop being so serious
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,8,"Any bad reviews are clearly from people who can't comprehend the fact that nobody involved in the making of this movie ever intended for it to be taken seriously.It's clearly just meant to be a dumb comedy that is silly for the sake of being silly. There are some really funny moments in this one, and a simple storyline to follow. I watched this while bored on a random Tuesday night and was engaged throughout. It's just an enjoyable movie.I can't shake one feeling though. This movie has some excellent cinematography, a good soundtrack and some very good actors. I just wonder whether using all those resources with the budget, while trying to make a serious movie, could have produced a decent western? I guess we'll never know."
" What You See Is What You Get
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,6,"Typical fare. Absolutely nothing unexpected; however moderately entertaining despite an over-abundance of lazy-writer ""bathroom humor."" Almost worth it for ""Mark Twain""'s cameo alone. Sandler's deadpan character admittedly well-done (though he has writing credits most of the dumber gags left to others). Solid production values.An obvious assumption (on my part at least) was expecting a loose parody of ""The Hateful Eight"" but only had 6 seconds when I THOUGHT it might resemble Quentin's ?masterpiece? (still unsure) Western. No attempt to do so besides the clear exploitation of the previous' title.About 30 minutes too long but most will see it through."
" It is not what everyone thoughts
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,9,"The movie is not actually REEEEAAALLYY bad. All of the actors really do it well on this movie like Sandler and Lautner. Mostly Lautner because we saw him on a role that he never got in almost any movie he performed.As any movie, it has some ups and downs, but it isn't really bad as the critics say. I'll just say to you: Watch it. You will really have a good time and laughs watching it! :)"
" The best part
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,5,"Was the little toddler waving the ax, twice. Such a little cutie."
" Truly Appauling
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,1,"This is beyond bad. It's really really really awful. It's the worst Adam Sandler movie I've ever seen. I like his movies but this isn't funny in an Adam Sandler way. What does that mean, well he usually shows his emotions and human side, like in That's My Boy, or The Wedding Singer. This movie never caught my interest. Let's make a funny western, sure I get it. I enjoyed A Million Ways to Die in The West. This is just uncomfortably pathetic. There's not one laugh in the whole thing. If people like this then that's good for them. I just couldn't sit through it."
" Don't know why poeple gave my boy such a hard time. His movies are a short remove from real life.
",2018-10-06 00:00:00,10,I have been an Adam Sandler fan for a long time. I was a teen when it all started then raised a son on his later work. My son seemed to like his stuff as much as me. I have an older uncle how uses Adams stuff as the reason America is falling apart must have at least one gay and one black kid in every family. He has a point but I don't care I think Sandler has some great movies and will always enjoy!!!!
" I shouldn't have watched this movie
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,2,Somehow I missed the fact that Adam Sandler was in this POS and I ended up watching it on Netflix. One of the worst movies I've ever watched all the way through - at 1 am I'm too tired to start a different film and just watch whatever I have started - I would have been better off just turning it off and getting more sleep. toward the end I felt the movie was punishing me for watching. When I saw the title I thought this was related to the Hateful Eight. Bad conclusion on my part. Except for the title there was no relationship. Unless you can stand Adam Sandler and can watch really unfunny bad comedies without vomiting - find something else or got to bed. Missing this movie is like missing a bullet to the brain.
" Hilarious
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,10,You guys that gave this ridiculous hilariousness less than ten stars have the sense of humor of an old school marm. It's stupid funny. Do yourself a favor and watch. You're welcome.
" Just funny
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,8,"I found this to be funny. It's nothing new or original but it's a little like ""Blazing Saddles"". The cast work well and there is some camaraderie with the ""brothers"". If you think Adam Sandler in a Mel Brooks type movie might amuse you it's worth a go, plenty of stupid gags, some donkey diarrhoea and genuine surprises."
" Misleading Humor!!!
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,7,"I'd never cherished Adam Sandler's humor, he seems pedantic, outdated, already no so young comedian, but here has another newcomers who supplied too much this absence, Taylor Lautner has a fabulous character as dumb guy, the donkey scene could be a polically incorrect nowadays, however funny certanly it is sure, the one eye gang were another unmissable and endless joke, at the final has a big surprise of this unpredicable fine movie although Sandler!!Resume:First watch: 2018 / How many: 1 / Source: DVD-R / Rating: 7"
" Great Comedy
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,10,You can not go by half of these review sites. This is a Adam Sandler comedy. It is meant to be off the wall out of the box. It's a shame that a lot of these critics seem to give pour reviews that don't even truly give the movie the proper justice. I would recommend this movie as it's well worth watching.
" A bit too ""ridiculous"" to my taste.
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,4,"I am a big fan of the Sandler movies. I know lots of peoples don't like them but i always find what i enjoy in them. Sometimes they are a bit silly but with just the right ammount of heart felt moments. Last time i finished a Sandler movie and taugh ""meh..."" was Jack and Jill. This is kinda the feeling i had with The Ridiculous 6. The characters are just a bit too goofy for my taste and i didn't really engage in the story much. I didn't hated it nor was i bored by the end but i just taugh it was very ordinary and outside a few chuckles at some of the slaptick humor, it just didn't do it for me. But honestly i can't think of any actors i like every single movies they made so its perfectly normal. I guess i just prefer when the characters are more grounded in reality even tough what happen to them around is a bit silly and unreal, wich is the case in most Sandler movies."
" Hilarious
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,9,"Some people seemed to not like the movie but I personally thought it was great. It has a pretty good plot, it's hilarious, and there's great acting. I loved the movie and definitely recommend."
" Please stop, Adam!
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,1,"I suppose this might be considered Adam Sandler's attempt at making a ""Blazing Saddles"" for the Millenials, but it falls so far short in every aspect... Comedy, not funny... Story line, moronic... Special effects, Ugh! There wasn't anything in this movie that made me even smile, the gags were so 3rd grader. C'mon Adam. We know you can do a lot better than this. Remember ""Happy Gilmore"", or ""Waterboy""? Yeah, that's the Sandler we haven't seen in years. Your brother the lawyer is way funnier than you, these days. Maybe you should hire him on as a writer."
" Hot burning dumpster fire
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,1,"I literally made an account to give this movie 1 star. Don't ever ever ever EVER watch this godforsaken pile of trash. 
Taylor L's first line is no joke ""Duurrrrrrrrrrrrhrrrrrr""
Never again Adam, this is trash, and I love Adam Sandler movies"
" LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie! Hilarious!
",2018-06-20 00:00:00,10,"So, I just watched all the Twilight films again with my 13 year old daughter who hadn't seen them yet (team Jacob!!!) and about a week later we watched Ridiculous 6. I just have to say after seeing Taylor Lautner go from hot werewolf to bumpkin half wit western boy, was a total shocker, but also made me respect him soooooo much as an actor! Honestly, to be so diverse like that, and be able to SLAY such a role (team Little Pete!!!) he did an amazing job. He's the last person I would expect to play a character like that, but I love that he took it on and nailed it!! What a treat!! The hanging scene though, I about peed my pants! Lol. I personally love slap stick comedy and enjoy most Adam Sandler movies. This movie is silly and funny and has a super fun star studded cast. I loved Vanilla Ice as Mark Twain and Blake Shelton as Wyatt Earp. Terry Cruz was another one I absolutely adored in this movie, he is so freaking hilarious!! People who are giving bad reviews and claiming it's a racist film need to get their panties out of a wad and loosen up. I cannot believe how easily offended every gets these days. I'm Caucasian and I absolutely died laughing at the part where the Native American pokes fun at white people ... ""I like to eat potato chips and play with my chest hair."" LOLOLOL. Seriously, lighten up people, have some fun, it's just a movie!!!! You know, make believe? I thought it was well done, super hilarious, very well cast and I'd give it a 20 out of 10 if I could! Make a sequel Adam! The Ridiculous 7, The Ridiculous 8! This could be the start of an epic franchise! Lol. Much love and laughs!"
" Stupid, but Oddly Entertaining
",2018-06-04 00:00:00,5,"As my title suggests, this movie is stupid. However, its also got some hilarious bits that makes it worthwhile. You know what you're getting with Adam Sandler, so you shouldn't expect much...and I wasn't. Sandler is Tommy, a white man raised by Indians who finally meets his white father, Frank (a gravely voiced Nick Nolte), a former bank robber who is dying and just wants to reconnect. When his father is kidnapped by his former gang, Tommy decides to rescue him. Along the way he finds out he has five other half brothers by his father (the six of the title). That's about it for plot.The humor comes from some very well placed cameos and a couple of REALLY funny scenes. Taylor Lautner is a dim witted boob who has a strong neck. So he gets himself hung to distract the crowd while his brothers rob the town bank. The humor comes from Lautner swinging wildly from the noose like a pendulum, giggling the entire time as if he's on a playground swing. The second laugh out loud scene is Harvey Keitel as a saloon owner named Smiley who has a massive piece of gold. The boys steal it and just as Smiley catches them and is going to shoot them, he looses his head, literally. I couldn't stop laughing at his headless corpse shooting both guns while his still smiling head is lying in the foreground. Lastly, there is an ongoing gag about a gang of one eyed men called the ""Left Eye Gang"" who remove their own eye and keep them in a jar. Steve Zahn's character wants to join so he has to perform the initiation of removing his right eye. Its done in the shadow on a cave wall so there is no gore, but its pretty grotesque and funny at the same time.The cameos are also well done. I won't list them all, but you can read the credits to see who played what. Most of them were hits, with just a few misses. Some of them I didn't even recognize the actors until I saw the credits. They completely immersed themselves in the roles.The movie is definitely not up there with Billy Madison or Happy Gilmore. But its not as bad as Jack and Jill. I really enjoy these actors and seeing them all having a good time was infectious.Give it a whirl."
" Mr Hit or Miss does it again
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,4,"As neutral as I am to comedy films with Adam Sandler in it, I therefore conclude he is the King of Misses rather than hits. This is like what Seth McFarlane did with Charlize Theron in that other rip off western movie. I don't hate Adam as I have seen films of his that were definitely worth the laugh, maybe as ridiculous as the title, there are a lot of fine actors making a cameo here e.g. Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi , Terry Crews and a bunch but one can't help but doze off as I didn't find 95% of the scenes funny. I will give credit that Adam Sandler is a creative person but either he sticks to voice over acting like Hotel Transylvania until a material suitable to him pops up in the future. If this is someone else's cup of tea kudos to you."
" Love the star studded cast
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,7,"It's an Adam Sandler movie. If you like that silliness (like I do), then you'll enjoy this one too. If you never liked Sandler's work, then this wasn't for you in the first place."
" No.
",2018-04-03 00:00:00,2,"For some reason I watched this on Netflix a few years ago. My mom thought it would be a good idea. It was not. This movie is a cheap-looking, poorly-acted, unfunny mess that should not be watched by anyone. Its not the worse movie ever, but its pretty bad."
" Bigger budget than the Hateful Eight
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,1,"The Ridiculous 6 had a bigger budget than the Hateful Eight. Jut let that sink in for a minute. A disproportionate amount of it must have went to acting fees 'cause this sure as hell doesn't look like a big budget movie.At this point it's all just a giant ruse to get Adam Sandler and his mates paid. Well, at least Sandler's pictures are out of the theatre and straight to netflix which is a step in the right direction.Congratulations all Netflix subscribers on paying for David Spade's new yacht. He's earned it."
" Great addition to my Sandler Collection.
",2018-02-23 00:00:00,10,This movie is ridiculously hilarious. It was not predictable and in no way slow. I have watched it at least ten times and I still cry/laugh during parts that I know are coming. Its great!
" A funny movie with a fun cast!
",2018-02-22 00:00:00,9,"First off, I believe this movie got bad reviews because some would consider it racist. This movie came out at the peak of political correctness, so that is why I think it got bad reviews.The intro of the movie has a sign that reads, ""No Injuns"" then the camera pans to another sign that reads, ""NO REDSKINS!"". It is in my humble opinion that people who rated this movie 1/10 didn't even watch this movie and/or they really dislike Adam Sandler.Lastly, this is a fun movie with a smashingly-great cast that you can tell really enjoyed making the movie. The only part I thought was slow and not needed was in the beginning with Sandler's father. That part was a snore fest. Other than that part, the movie is interesting and has a good pace.Don't believe the snowflakes."
" One of Sandler's most embarrassing films.
",2018-01-19 00:00:00,2,"I as a film critic am usually very kind towards Adam Sandler's films. I was able to find enjoyment in movies like Grown Ups, That's My Boy, Pixels (all modern Sandler productions that were critically panned). I did enjoy That's My Boy the most out of those 3 I mentioned because I just have a really f**ked up sense of humor. Other movies of his such as Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison and Bulletproof I find to be comedic gold. However, when it comes to some of his other comedies, that range from mediocre to being god awful! Mediocre ones being films such as Blended, Grown Ups 2, Sandy Wexler. God awful is stuff like The Do-Over, Jack and Jill (which I think is the worst film of the decade so far), and THIS! I hate the entire 119 minute run time of this movie! This movie is far too long, REALLY boring, and unfunny! 85-90 minutes would have been plenty long enough for this movie. Watching this movie for the first time in December 2015, around the 90 minute mark or so, I thought we were at the climax already, but I found out there was another 30 minutes to go! Not once did the comedy in this movie make me laugh. There is almost nothing more terrible than a comedy that doesn't make you laugh. The two good things that I can at least say about this movie is that not all the acting is terrible, and the action scenes can be somewhat entertaining at times. Other than that, this is easily one of the worst things Sandler has ever come out with. If you see it on Netflix, don't press play, you'll never get those 2 hours back."

In doing so he meets 5 unlikely individuals who are his half brothers. The film is no ""Blazing Saddles."" It is filled with clich√©s and gross sex humor. The humor was hit and miss and most of the time it missed miserably in its juvenile attempt to be funny. Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Plenty of adult humor."

",2018-01-06 00:00:00,8,"I found this to be a surprisingly enjoyable American Western style film.The story was actually quite decent, with suspense, silliness, and stereotypes.I particularly liked the stereotypes, even though they were over the top. Some parts of the film were ridiculous, but hey, it's in the title.I was very surprised, as I find some Adam Sandler films to be pretty stupid.Some reviews seem to be quite harsh on the stereotypes used, but stories and life are both boring without them. Everyone stereotypes everyone, and it's entertaining to see it highlighted by others or by stories and films - no matter what you profess externally.You could even say the stereotypes were subverted to an extent: The hick had some poignant thoughts and ideas, the Indians weren't drunkards and had some modern ideals, the black was creative and worked, the women were 'strong', the white men were baddies.I suggest not getting caught up in political correctness to the point of illness, and just watch this film as an independent piece of art/entertainment, instead of feeling compelled to judge it badly out of obligation or guilt. I think you'll be happier if you do, and might actually enjoy the story as well as the 'incorrectness' of the humour."
" Great fun movie
",2017-11-11 00:00:00,10,"This is a movie aimed at making you laugh, which I did a lot throughout. The humour works, the scenes are well thought out to make you laugh, and the acting is pretty good. The first time I watched it I thought it was funny and OK, the second time I watched it I laughed my guts out. Enjoy this movie it is worth your time."
" Buffet of Styles
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,3,"(Flash Review)You are at a buffet and filling your plate with eggs, tater tots, meatloaf, sushi, fruit, corn and spam and then you trip and spill it on the floor. That is my analogy for this movie. It is an amalgamation of slap stick, Western, potty humor, witty humor, drama and goofy gore. None of which work together well as a cohesive meal. The plot is Sandler's long lost father reappears and shortly thereafter gets taken by bandits to find some buried money that isn't really there so they'll kill him. Sandler feels bad so he tries to get the money to save his father and along the way comes across five of his step brothers. The most clever gag was these guys run into Abner Doublday that actual man who invented baseball and in the scene he sort of invents the rules as he goes. Very strange and random¬Ölike the rest of the movie. Not super funny but it had a few decent moments."
" Spoiler...It's a dumpster fire
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,1,"How is it that Sandlers movies aimed at kids have the most mature humor? An ongoing joke through this movie was literally ""I had sex with your mom"". They felt the need to tell this ""joke"" six times. I have to admit that it's been a while since I watched this but I don't recall laughing at all through this whole movie."
" Adam Sandler-esk, Per Usual
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,5,"Lets see, where to start with this one! Right off the bat I can tell you that it is a typical Adam Sandler movie. If you like the others, you will find this one appealing. If you don't like his other movies you will probably hate this movie.Lets talk specifics. The Netflix Original movie is 1 hour and 59 minutes (119 minutes) long. The time frame is decent and if you are into the movie it will fly by. This movie is one of the most well known actor, jammed packed as they come. You can sit on IMDb.com and scroll for a while and still see names you recognize. I'm not sure this movie paid well for anyone, but was more of a fun project. On top of the already mentioned leads you have names like: Will Forte, Steve Zahn, Nick Nolte, Jon Lovitz, David Spade, Danny Trejo, Nick Swardson, Blake Shelton, and Vanilla Ice. Honestly that list keeps going, its incredible how many people they got to be in this movie.As we look to the plot, you quickly realize, like most of his movies it is loose and only there as a basic structure. To sum it up Tommy (Adam Sandler) is an orphan raised by Native Americans. His dad comes back and then gets taken. The rest of the movie is about him and his newly found five brothers trying to rescue their dad. Again, the movie is really more about the cast and how they interact with each other.The humor in the movie is 'stupid' and 'childish', and that isn't meant in a mean/bashing way. It, at times, is very inappropriate and brash. Other times it is just corny, and you wonder how these movie keep getting funded at all. That being said if you like that sort of humor even a little bit, you will laugh. I'll be the first to admit that these movies are a nice getaway from everyday life. It is nice to be able to watch a movie and not have to worry about following it too closely. I do like 'stupid' humor and I laughed a lot.It is as random as they come and to see all of these people play parts you never thought they would, it's pretty amazing.But, when you turn to the aspect of scoring/rating a movie like this they are always low. Scoring is serious and movies that aren't taken too seriously on purpose, know they will be ranked low before they even start. As for being a comedy, yes but not well thought out comedy. As for western¬Ö..it takes part in the West, but that's about it. Again it's loose, the themes of a western aren't there but the costumes and what not are. Take it with a grain of salt.In summary, I laughed. The plot is basic. You never know which actor you will see next, and they all work great together in weird roles. It is your typical Sandler movie and should be treated as such. If I had a choice of never seeing it in the first place or watching it twice, I would watch it again.That being said movies like this fall flat in the ratings and I would personally give this movie a 4.5/10"
" ""Teach them not to mess with the Stockburn Brothers.""
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,6,"1974 brought us ""Blazing Saddles"" and some four decades later, the comedy Western is stood on it's head with a movie so ridiculous it had to be called ""The Ridiculous 6"". The concept wasn't so bad, but when you get so many Saturday Night Alumni involved in one place at one time, you're just asking for trouble. In addition to principals like Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider, you had cameos from folks like Jon Lovitz (Ezekiel Grant), David Spade (General George Custer), Chris Kattan (John Wilkes Booth) and Norm MacDonald (a customer at the Golden Nuggets). If I missed any I apologize, they kept popping up at such a furious pace it was hard to keep track.There's some funny stuff going on in the story to be sure, but the film is brought down a considerable notch with the vulgar humor and the burro who couldn't help itself whenever he broke wind. In his case, he kept breaking mini-mud storms, if you know what I mean, and once would have been enough but the writers just couldn't help themselves. Stuff like that just panders to the lowest common denominator.I had to laugh when Frank Stockburn (Nick Nolte) turned bad guy against son Tommy/White Knife (Sandler) and the rest of his boys, explaining how one should ""Never bring a knife to a gunfight"". It sounded like something President Obama once said, though it's doubtful he ever found himself in a compromising position in Jawbone Falls, Sweet Hog Rock or Rattler's Gulch. At least the screenwriters got the chronology correct for the characters they introduced in cameo parts, like Mark Twain, Wyatt Earp, George Custer and Abner Doubleday.You know, John Ford and John Wayne have to be spinning in their graves with this absurdist take on the Western genre. You can pretty much bet they never came across a formation in Monument Valley like the penis rock the Ridiculous Ones found in Silver Canyon. All in all, I'd have to say that using the term 'ridiculous' in the title takes some of the edge off what one might otherwise expect in a film like this, because it's all of that. And just to show you how ridiculous the movie really is, the actor portraying Mark Twain is Vanilla Ice. Can you get any more ridiculous than that?"
" Just not able to watch
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,1,"This is the second time we have started this movie, thought we remembered it, got to the part (I don't know how, in a tired stupor I guess) with all the holes dug in the ground. I am a New Mexico native and know the area where the filming was taking place,it just sacrilegious to even go to this place and film this trash! Shame on everyone involved!! You all should be ashamed."
" Horrific. Just unbelievably bad.
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,1,"Netflix, if you're going to support films that are atrocious to women and inherently racist then at least make them funny...Truly the worst film I've ever seen.I mean it genuinely makes me sad that there are thousands of incredibly talented writers in the independent film world that would make a movie 1 million times better for 1/10 of the price but instead, Adam Sandler is getting millions to keep making this trash. And the worst part is that money is coming from a company that is a leader in pushing boundaries and better representation.I suppose I shouldn't be surprised it was hailed as a success despite shocking reviews... we are living in a world where Donald Trump is president afterall!"
" ridiculously hilarious
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,10,"ha ha ha one of the funniest movie of all time , not much of an art work though . those expecting some award winning piece of art/$h!t will be disappointed . but if don't mind some light heart ed humor like MOVIE 43 , American PIE , SCARY MOVIE ,INAPPROPRIATE COMEDY and just wanna laugh and have fun , you are gonna love it ."
" Love it!
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,10,"OK. This is just a mix of goofy comedy with dark humor as a normal Adlan Sander does. Don't take seriously, don't try to make a normal sense but if you have a bad day and want to have a good laugh watch it! I particularly love the baseball part and love the acting from Taylor. He is awesome not being the hot boy. Plus has all the actors that I love for the last decade. Enjoy, get a popcorn and have a good time."
" Another stinker from Happy Madison
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,2,The first Happy Madison Production for Netflix continues Sandler's decline into the unfunny. There is little to recommend this lazy and cynical western parody other than proof of Sandler and his buddies using these movies as easy paydays. For the curious or masochistic only.
" A fun movie that requires you only to sit and laugh.
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,6,"I've had Netflix for a few years. I've used it twice. Haha. I decided, last week to check out an Adam Sandler movie. This week, I watched his other two. This movie I watched last night. I will not tell you what it is about. You can read that other places. I will say this. It did make me laugh. It very much reminded me of a Mel Brooks movie. When I first watched Hogh Anexiety a few years ago, I thought it was amazing. I told myself that I wanted to write movies like that. But, I convinced myself that movie like that were no longer made. Turns out they are. An Oscar film, this is not. But, it is dumb humor. It made me laugh a lot. From the three of his films I have watched, this would be ranked three on my list. But, from watching his movies, I am so excited to see the one coming out in a week. One of the best things about these, is that it just seems like him and the cast are having fun. Keep it up. I am excited to see more."
" Fun.Really, it's fun
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,7,Vanilla Ice plays Mark Twain. This movie isn't that serious. Anybody watching this film should be aware by the name alone that it's just a bit of fun. I enjoyed it. I probably won't watch it again but there's a huge place for those sort of films in the movie world. Most comedies these days are either dark or they are dramatic comedies and they get great reviews but sometimes it's just great to watch something silly with no higher purpose. This is it. All Sandler's films are.
" Adam Sandler is past his prime.
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,2,"The Ridiculous 6 is a very poor attempt at comedy from the late Adam Sandler. And while it is not Jack and Jill bad, it is close enough. The movie has some of the absolute dumbest humour I have seen in a film, all the characters have the personality of toilet paper, and I have never seen Adam Sandler look this uninterested in a movie, ever! Hate ""A Million Ways to Die in the West"" all you want, but at least that movie had decent characters and quite a few funny jokes! Another thing wrong about this movie is that this movie is too long. There was no reason for this movie to be 119 minutes long! The only thing that saves this movie is that the final act did have some good action. Don't watch The Ridiculous 6, it is an awful comedy with boring characters and unfunny jokes."
" Ridiculous indeed
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,2,"If that is your thing, than go ahead. Also if you are an Adam Sandler fan anyway (or one of his usual guys he's hanging out with of course). But there are new additions. And while I'm not that surprised that Nick Nolte is on board (Al Pacino and other have gone that way too), I didn't recognize Jorge Garcia. You may remember him from Lost (as Hurley), but he's wearing a lot of stuff in this, which kind of hides him. Not to mention that he doesn't really talk.While it tries to walk a like of being as silly as possible, but also to have some weight/gravitas, I'd say it fails miserably. Not to mention that running two hours it's way too long. There are poop jokes throughout, kind of woven into the story if you give it the benefit of the doubt. But generally speaking the jokes are missing. Unless you can laugh at ridiculous stuff ... which brings us back to the title ..."
