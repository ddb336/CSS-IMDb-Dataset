" It's whatever
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,5,It's not good but also not bad. It's not boring or anything but i won't ever watch it again.Remember Toy Story the documentary about toys coming to life and making that kid Sid's life hell by scarring him just because he broke toys that he had no idea were alive and used this to cope with his toxic home life? Well it's like that but not as good and with animals.So yeah that's all. Your kids will probably watch it and not get bored but like they won't look back at it in 10 years.
" Lots of nudity EXTREME
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,2,Most of the characters are nude all body nudity EXTREMELY GRAPHIC (DO NOT WATCH WITH KIDS)
" Toy Story, but with Pets and not Good
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,3,"The Secret Life of Pets is the latest Illumination Entertainment film to release and tells the story of Max, a seemingly ordinary dog, who is forced to deal with the a new addition to his family. The film features to the likeness of Louie C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart and many others. The marketing to this film was excellent and featured a well put together trailer montage of different pets doing things while their owners are gone, the trailer was sweet and funny and though it didn't hint too much at what the story may be it kept be interested and excited for the release of the film. Sadly the final product is not as good as the marketing was, the best and funniest parts in this movie were the scenes already shown in that initial trailer. The beginning of the film starts off very strong, but as it continues rolling along it loses steam and delves into a story that is too big and too complex for its own good, featuring the underbelly of New York and its gang of abandoned pets, that just felt stupid and out of place. My reaction to this may be due to my expectations that film would remain in the real world, by having these pets get into everyday problematic situations but it goes for an approach that I didn't necessarily dig and honestly kind of lost me. I do appreciate what the writers were going for as on paper the story itself is pretty good but it just didn't translate well to film and at the end of the day just came off as a Toy Story rip off. This still isn't the worst animated film in the world, as it did have jokes sprinkled throughout that made me laugh, it just had so much potential that it sadly never lived up to. Also the animation itself felt lazy and the voice acting not extravagant considering the amount of talent this movie featured. In the end, this is just an okay animation that'll entertain young kids, I can't really hate on it too much considering how great the opening 15-20 minutes are, it's just a shame the rest of the movie maintained that greatness, The Secret Life of Pets gets a 3/10"
" Beautiful BEAUTIFUL adventure!
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,9,You will be mesmerized by the art concept of New-York. You will be falling in love with the cats. You will hug your children closer. You will have a great time. Highly recommended!
" A perfect movie for pet owners
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,8,"I think this one of Illumination's best movies that they've done, probably one of in the top 5 best movies from the company and I think people are just saying it's bad because they don't like Illumation.Not just that, but also saying that the movie is a rip off of Toy Story. The only similarity I could find if that when the humans are gone, the pets do their thing without them around, which is like when humans are gone the toys do their thing without them around. But that's it. Everything else in the movie does it's own thing.The animation is pretty good, the characters are very likable and I can laugh pretty hard at them, and the writing is really good as well. The humor works brilliantly on the animals, it works great and fits them perfectly.As a dog person my whole life, I can easily understand what their feeling and their personalities. Max looks just like my old Jack Russell who passed away almost two years ago, he reminds me a lot of him and what it was like when he was alive. By the way, what type of dog is Duke supposed to be? My guess is that he's a mix of a chocolate lab and a shaggy dog.Snowball is the most random thing in the entire movie, and Kevin Hart was the perfect choice to voice him. He just says some of the funny stuff in the movie, and sure is out of control. Sure, his plan is to destroy the human race and take over the world is pretty cliche, but this one is a pass for me.So, if your a dog or cat owner/person like I am (for dogs at least) and not a hater on Illumination, than this is perfect movie for you and your family to have fun watching and get laughs at."
" Phenomenal movie, from animation to great story, a perfect film!!

" Awful ripoff of Toy Story.

" A Wonderful Animal Film

" The Secret Life of Pets
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,5,"I had seen images and clips from this computer-animated movie a number of times in the last few years, I knew it must be popular, so I'm glad when I got the opportunity to watch it, directed by Chris Renaud (Despicable Me, The Lorax). Basically, in a Manhattan apartment, Max (Louis C.K.) is a pampered Jack Russell Terrier who enjoys his life with his owner Katie (Ellie Kemper). While Katie is at work during the day, Max hangs out with other pets in the building: tabby cat Chloe (Lake Bell), pug Mel (Bobby Moynihan), dachshund Buddy (Hannibal Buress), and budgie Sweet Pea (Tara Strong). One day, Katie adopts Duke (Eric Stonestreet), a large Newfoundland mix from the pound, leaving Max jealous because of her divided attention on the new dog. Both dogs do not get on with each other, leading to an argument in an alley. There, Max and Duke are attacked by cats led by Sphynx cat Ozone (Steve Coogan), who steals both their collars and leaves them to be caught by Animal Control, mistaking them for strays. Duke fears that he will be killed if he goes back to the pound. Gidget (Jenny Slate), a white Pomeranian, who has a crush on Max, discovers that he is missing and decides to find him. When the Animal Control van crashes, Max and Duke are rescued by white rabbit Snowball (Kevin Hart), the leader of ""The Flushed Pets"", a cult of feral animals living in the sewer who hate humans because their owners mistreated and abandoned them. Max and Duke pretend to despise humans also, claiming they killed their owners, so the Flushed Pets invite them to join. The two are about to get a snakebite from a one-fanged viper as a test, but the alley cats barge in and inform Snowball that Max and Duke are still pets. Their cover blown, the two dogs escape the sewers and board a ferry to Brooklyn, inadvertently killing the viper in the process. Snowball vows vengeance to kill them and leads the Flushed Pets after them. Meanwhile, Gidget befriends a red-tailed hawk named Tiberius (Albert Brooks) to find Max, and they find Ozone, whom Gidget gets to tell what he knows about the dogs. To help the search, they enlist Mel, Buddy, Chloe, guinea pig Norman (Chris Renaud) and Sweet Pea. Along the way, they meet Pops (Wayne's World's Dana Carvey), an old Basset Hound who joins to help the pets find Max. Gidget and the team encounter Snowball, who vows to kill them as well, and Norman is captured as the rest of the team flees. Meanwhile, Max and Duke wind up in a sausage factory surrounded by meat. While there, Duke tells Max about his previous owner, Fred, an elderly man who adopted him as a puppy and loved spending time with him. One day, Duke got lost while chasing a butterfly and was caught by Animal Control, but Fred never came to claim him. Max convinces him to visit Fred's house nearby, confident Fred will still love him and take him back. But they learn from the resident cat Reginald (Steve Coogan) that Fred has died. Heartbroken, Duke accuses Max of attempting to get rid of him, and his barking gets the neighbours to call Animal Control. The handlers catch Max, but Duke distracts them long enough for Max to escape and gets himself captured instead. While trying to rescue Duke as he follows the Animal Control van, Max is attacked by Snowball who tries to kill him. However, when his gang is captured, Snowball realises that he and Max must work together to rescue them. Using vehicles, they chase the van all the way to the Brooklyn Bridge. Max is circled by the Flushed Pets, unaware that he has teamed with Snowball, but Gidget and her team save him. Upon seeing Gidget using her kung-fu fighting skills, Max starts to fall in love with her. Max gets the keys to Duke's cage, but the van plummets into the East River with him inside. Max is unable to free Duke, but Snowball wakes and jumps into the water to retrieve the keys and help them to escape the sinking van. The entire group returns to the apartment block by pig-driven taxi. Max expresses his love for Gidget, who returns his affection. Snowball and the Flushed Pets form a plan to annihilate all humans, but a woman and her daughter named Molly (Kiely Renaud) come along and Snowball is adopted while the remaining Flushed Pets return to the sewers. At first, Snowball resists, but gives in and lets himself become a domesticated pet once again. All the pets return to their homes and embrace their owners, and Max and Duke finally reunite with Katie, forming a true friendship. Also starring Michael Beattie as Tattoo, Sandra Echeverría as Maria, and Jaime Camil as Fernando, with additional voices from Bob Bergen, Jim Cummings, Bill Farmer, Jess Harnell, and Jason Marsden. The voice cast is all fine, the animation is of course great, and the story is simplistic enough, seeing what pets get up to behind closed doors, I agree the concept is a little overstretched, but it is entertaining. The highlights of the film are seeing poodle Leonard listening to classical music whilst the owner is in the house, but raving with punk music when alone; the sausage factory Grease ""We Go Together"" sequence, and the ending with the classic Bill Withers song ""Lovely Day"", also with clever references to Saturday Night Fever, Minions, Sing, and Some Like It Hot. If you are looking for some fun for all the fun, with just enough good material to satisfy both kids and grown-ups, then this isn't a bad choice, a reasonable animated comedy adventure. Worth watching!"
" 😍 Fantastic movie for all ages! Everyone should watch this film!
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,9,"Looking for a great movie, that's hilarious? This movie is heart warming,its a very fun watch that you can enjoy alone or with someone (turn off the light-close the blinds get your loved ones,treats and cuddle up for a great time!)- I thought this was a great film! It was so very well done from the story line and brilliantly written and quite humorous script! To the gorgeous animation that is stunningly executed. Consistently complimenting the very creatively and carefully crafted characters that you will instantly fall in love with and keep you smiling and laughing through out the film! T he cast and voicing worked well with the beautiful illustration to really brought the characters and movie to life! Ultimately bringing the whole movie home.It doesn't matter if your 5 or 50 just be happy and enjoy the simple things in life ( the things that actually matter ;) -Take Care World."
" funny
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,7,"The movie gives us a chance to get close to pets, so that pets can sell their cuteness on the screen unscrupulously, and audiences familiar with pets can treat all kinds of pets, especially dogs, as treasures. Perhaps this is the original intention of lighting entertainment. After all, pets are the most loyal friends of mankind, we are their world, and we should give them unlimited pets and love."
" A whole lot of nothing
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,4,"This film keeps on setting things up and just leaving them. The rivalry between Max and Duke could have gone somewhere, but it just resolved itself. Duke trying to find his previous owner could have gone somewhere, but it was glossed over in a minute. The only thing that really went somewhere was the sewer animals and that was more comedic. The animation itself and the side characters made up for this meandering storyline, with the exception of Kevin Hart - sorry, he's just too loud and obnoxious."
" Very good.
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,10,"I was attracted to this film for a simple reason: my girlfriend is very fond of animated films. From the same creators of ""Despicable Me"", its quite interesting and begins with a good premise: what do our pets do when we leave home every day...The whole story revolves around Max and Duke, two dogs who end up lost in New York. While the remaining animals in the building join forces to find them, led by a cute little dog, Gidget, they end up in trouble when they find - and irritate - the mob led by Snowball, a lovely white rabbit who has a deep hatred for humans. This film was made for younger audiences but not entirely for children, I believe, so I think that children over seven or eight years old will understand the film very well, which is not exactly shocking.One of the most interesting things here is the long list of adorable and cute characters. The dogs (Max, Duke, Gidget, Pops, Buddy and Mel) are noteworthy but are closely followed by the rabbit, Snowball, which was so successful and became so popular that it was one of the movie's merchandising hits. The obese cat Chloe, the guinea-pig Reginald, the budgerigar Sweet Pea and the hawk Tiberius also deserve a special look. The dialogues and jokes were well done and there are subtle nods here and there to another studio works (particularly the ""Despicable Me"" franchise) as well as other popular films and series like ""Saturday Night Fever"". However, jokes and humor are not to laugh out loud and sometimes barely works. The film has excellent voice actors, most of them with some other voice works in their pocket. Among them, I highlight the performance of Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Jenny Slate, Albert Brooks, Lake Bell, Steve Coogan and Kevin Hart.Technically, it was difficult to demand better. It has one of the best opening sequences I've seen in animated films, with the animals taking care of their owners' houses as soon as they walk out the front door. CGI and the quality of the animations are impeccable, with the animals drawn in their details, magnificent colors and light, movement and action at the right times and inexhaustible doses of cuteness. I read some comments on the Internet in which some people said they had experienced difficulties with the pace, with the second part proving to be more tiring and dragging. Personally, I didn't feel that much, I think it developed well and the final part was really fun. Perhaps yes, one or another scene takes longer than necessary, perhaps a more skillful editing effort has been lacking, but that seem to me a minor problem. Finally, I still have to leave a note of praise for the excellent soundtrack, by Alexandre Desplat, with some jazz tones that are simply pleasant... and pertinent! After all, it's New York!"
" it's fine, good family movie 5\10
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,5,"Kevin hart is always perfect when he is voice acting, Louis C.K and Eric stonestreet are good too. and the animation that gives you good vibes of ""Despicable me"" and the sequels. overall it's fine not too much to say about it but if you want to watch a good animation movie with your family then I recommend this. also good soundtrack."

" The secret Life of pets
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,8,"Kids movies continue to swarm into the theaters, and Hollywood's trailer editors have been hard at work baiting us in. With Disney owning the box office this summer, Illumination Entertainment (the creators of Despicable Me) are taking a shot at the box office run. This weekend we got The Secret Life Of Pets, a movie that has been highly anticipated since it's trailer debut from so long ago. It was indeed a very entertaining trailer, but we all know how trailers can be deceptive now don't we? So I have headed into the trenches again to report on the latest film to hit the silver screen.The GOOD Cute/Kid Friendly Funny Good animationWhen you watch, or for many rewatch, the trailers you most likely saw the characters as cute, cuddly animals doing hilarious things. Good news! The trailer is accurate this time and provides the cute factor you expected (including the very scenes you saw in the trailer). All of the characters are adorable, the main ones being bouncy, fluffy, high-spirited animals that will make you want to say Awwwwww. Our design team found a way to maximize all the cute features of an animal and sell it to the families that will lead to merchandising. Even animals you wouldn't think cute (like snakes, gators, and lizards) get the cuddly personifications. Hopefully you have gathered from this, that the design is kid friendly and will have your little ones enamored.But cute is only the hook, what keeps the interest going in this film? The answer is the comedy of course. The stunts the animals pull are entertaining and the dialogue itself had me chuckling at many of the media references. Voice acting only helps sell the comedy more, especially Kevin Hart and all his high pitched screaming. Your kids though will be the ones to enjoy the comedy the most though, as it is slapstick, simplistic antics with digital pets. Running into walls, making funny faces, or going to the bathroom on the floor are just some of the things you will see that had toddlers chuckling in their seats.And a small bonus, that really shouldn't be a surprise, is that the animation is good. Illumination Entertainment certainly has their anatomy and physiology down being able to superimpose human qualities while still maintaining there animal qualities. Glad to know that our animation studios are still able to produce great works. If only they could have put that effort into the next few qualities.THE BAD The Story Lack of Uniqueness Trailers showed you a lot of the movieWith the comedy and animation being the obvious focus, you have to wonder how the story fared in this movie. Unfortunatelyit didn't fare that well. Oh it's not that bad at all, but the problem is that it lacks anything memorable or emotionally driving for me. The writers crammed a lot of plots into a short 90 minutes run time, and the resulting production was a very rushed, shallow tale with little development. A split focus resulted in little emotional build-up, and there was no intriguing qualities to keep my attention on any of the cast. And the goal they were trying to achieve was very limited and didn't really set any time limit or urgency to the tale.To add more fuel to that fire, The Secret Life of Pets wasn't really that unique of a movie. We've had talking pet movies before, where anthropomorphic animals traverse a city or town that often involves a very extreme villain (think Oliver and Company or Homeward Bound). Those tales stick home because they had edge, depth, and moments that stick out in your mind. Not the case with this movie, as again there was no drive to make our pets grow, develop, or even go through much struggle at all. It doesn't have any twists to mix things up either, and therefore leaves little to spoilt. In addition, much of the movie, including a lot of the funny parts, is revealed in the three trailers out and therefore you can save yourself some major bucks by just rewatching all of the trailers. Yeah, I know that is de"
" for children one
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,6,"The trailer I saw before is quite interesting, but the positive film doesn't actually have much bright spots. Cute appearance, evil inner contrast cute has been rotten, pets escape from animalcontrol has been the plot since Miss and rogue. It might be more interesting to have more proud cats. In the end, the pet and the owner are expected to end happily together, about a work for children to see."
" Is this for children?
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,4,"The poster and trailer were amazing. But the whole story was too unrealistic. I was thinking about ""drama"" about pets or pet version of toy story. How they interact with each other when no humans around.But then, i disappoint, even the violence was not tolerable (especially if you expect to watch this movie with your kids).Find another film if you expect on fable animation with good drama."
" About pets's love
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,7,"One of the most memorable scenes for me was the adoption of little white. When a passing little girl will it in his arms, small white's first reaction is to fight, just in a few seconds, the girl gently and love to hold it, it quickly calm down no longer fight, until the meek in the girl's arms to sleep. Here is a doubt: small white was originally the leader of the black group bent on killing mankind, what is in a few seconds, so that his attitude to mankind has changed so much? I think the answer is love."
" funny
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,7,"If you have pets, be sure to watch this movie, after watching you will love your baby more. If you do n't have a pet but you like it very much, you will also go to watch this movie, it will tell you that it is a responsibility, and the cute animals will also have annoying placesThis movie is really interesting for pet owners. The details inside are great, showing the character of cats and dogs"
" Perfectly safe family fun
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"One critic's review I read said ""It's a beat-for-beat ""Toy Story"""". I don't know what movie that critic watched, because I didn't think that at all. It has some similarities in the beginning, but by the 45-minute mark it becomes different enough, and it was clever. There was one scene in a sausage factory that I found particularly hilarious. The film does a great job of capturing the funny, quirky things our pets do. I laugged several times at the hijinks the animals got into, because I've had some of those expereinces myself with my pets. The villain,voiced by Kevin Hart, was one of the best parts. His craziness and over-the-top voice acting made him one of my favorite characters. The animals' love and devotion for their owners was adorable. Overall, I'd say this has been a great year for animation. I rank this up there with ""Kubo"" and ""Zootopia."" Will it be nominated for an Oscar? Probably not, but that doesn't mean it's not good. This is definetely worth checking out. My only complaint: It felt too short. I wanted more.
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"

" Cheap and Nasty
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,9,"We'd seen trailers for this so wanted to investigate. Thin storyline, cheap animation and lowest common denominator humour.
Utter rubbish."
" Terrible shameless cash grab
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,2,This movie was only made because people like cute animals and cats and stuff. And you can tell they hardly put any work into this bad movie. The characters are bland and stereotypical and the story has been done many times before . Also jokes are bad and the whole entire movie is boring
" Utterly bland and pointless!
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,3,"Uncompelling and uninspired, Secret Life of Pets feels more pointless and cliche than anything of higher quality. It's something we've seen many times before just a little bit worse."
" ""I feel heroic! And handsome!""
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,10,"Illumination Studios does it again! By creating the most unique characters and best writing, they have boosted their credibility as an animated movie powerhouse. Capable of competing with any of its production competitors.This film is utterly hilarious! I've seen it so many times, by now I probably know every line by heart. The adorable animals have amazingly detailed personalities and characteristics. This is definitely one of my favorite animated movies. You don't have to be kid to love this movie, just an animal lover."
" They could've executed it all a bit better
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed the opening few scenes and the closing few scenes, but everything in between is a little meh.Plot is rather predictable, while the voice cast are a little dull sounding; despite doing solid jobs each. 'The Secret Life of Pets' isn't a bad film by any means, though I feel they could've executed it all a bit better."
" Brilliant Family Movie
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,9,Kevin Hart is brilliant and so funny! Loved this so watched it again. :) and yes I am an adult! ;)
" This is my favorite movie!!!
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,10,"I really love this movie, this is my favorite movie ever, because I love Dogs and Cats movies and this is too funny. My favorite characters from The Secret Life of Pets is Max, Duke, Mel and Chloe."
" An unbalanced movie
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,6,"The best parts of this movie are contained in the first 20 mins and the last 10 mins. This is because they concentrate on the relationship between pets and their owners. People with pets will relate to these parts strongly and appreciate the subtle nuances that really encapsulate that unique bond between a person and their pet.The action parts will please the younger children but in reality most adults will find these a bit boring as to a degree it's a bit ""Tom & Jerry"" slapstick."
" Hilarious Hounds.
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,7,"While some have compared the film's storyline to that of Toy Story, it is still a fun heartwarming adventure for all of the family, fun characters & bright colours will keep you entertained throughout."
" The Secret Life of Pets
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,8,Better than it should have been. The humor was good in some areas and disgusting in others (sausage scene was the wurst).
" Very well done, but not for me
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,5,"Pet movies are cute, and so is this. This has many funny moments of what pets might do or think when humans are away, but that's it. The idea is original and I waited more, but it is far from classics like Oliver and company or Aristocats or other animated animal movies. Kind of fell flat after the mid-point and I soon lost interest, but did watch it till the end.
Maybe works better for younger people, and that is just fine. It is very well done and the dogs are cute, but for me it has no spark so I would watch it again."
" Fun, family movie

Totally worth it"
" This movie is great but It's too similar to Toy Story...
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,7,"... Wanna know why this movie is similar to TS?? 1. Both Owners get a new toy/dog that they love and the owners neglect the old toy/dog and the old toy/dog hates the new toy/dog. 2. Both of the two toys/dogs get stuck with each other and get lost and try to find a way back to their owners. 3. Both of the toys/pets can talk or come to life when their owners aren't looking or to other toys/pets. 4. I know this has happened in many other films before, but a romantic subplot between Woody and Bo/Max and Gidget. Thats all I could think of. Oh we have the characters that seem to act similar to the characters we see in TS. Max=Woody Duke=Buzz Gidget=Bo Peep Snowball=Presumably Sid?? and Katie=Andy. This movie has some funny and inappropriate jokes for example we see the antagonist Snowball laughing maniacally and then craps all over the floor on screen and we see a cat playing with the crap. Some material in this film may not seem suitable for children such as Snowball saying he wants to murder the owners and other humans, The Van falling off the Brooklyn Bridge and into the water and Snowball and Max trying to escape, and that huge snake coming out of the pipe and being crushed by piles of bricks. Overall, I give this a 7/10."
" The secret life of pets
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,9,"The Secret Life of Pets"" is a very successful film from Universal, the same folks who brought us the ""Despicable Me"" franchise. While I am thrilled that the studio decided to do something other than yet another sequel, ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a highly uneven movie.The story starts off terrifically well. The opening sequence is simply breaktaking--with some of the best CGI you'll ever see. I was very impressed with this...as well as watching all the various pets acting like pets. However, the film simply did not maintain this momentum. Once the two dogs, Max and Duke, got lost...so did the story. The notion of human-hating animals living in the sewers and stealing dog pound trucks is pretty stupid....and unappealing. Instead of being cute like the film had been, it tries to get edgy and it misfires. In other words, and this will sound weird, the film was much better when it had little in the way of plot (one of the reasons I loved ""Minions"" is because it was less wedding to plot and more to fun). Overall, an uneven film that becomes somewhat tiresome after a while."
" Unfunny, Safe, and Bland
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,1,"The best parts of this movie are all spoiled in the trailer, and I barely laughed at any of the jokes (or smiled for that matter). As soon as the first 10 minutes went by, I knew exactly what was going to happen, and I was correct (which doesn't usually happen). It is a cheap rip-off of Toy Story if I have ever seen one. It baffles me that this made so much money, and it saddens me that not even half of the money this movie got didn't go to Kubo and the Two Strings, a far superior summer animated movie from 2016. The animation is not bad, I will admit, but the human designs look no different than Illuminations other human characters (tiny eyes, big noses, skinny legs). I was in a depression when I saw this movie and honestly, I felt more depressed leaving than I did entering. I was 11 when I saw this, so I was the perfect demographic. This is the worst film I have ever seen. I apoligize if this doesn't help you."

",2019-07-19 00:00:00,7,"The animation was exceptional and jokes were original, but the story...this movie could have got a so much better plot I mean if you are familiar with the common story flows(Main role lives his life,Something happened to him,Lose almost everything and gain even more) then you won't be surprised.Because of the crappy story I don't think this movie worth more than 7 stars.(One time movie)."
" Toy Story...i mean ""Pet Story""?
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,3,"Let's put aside the fact that this is actually a remake of Toy Story with bits of Toy Story 2. Unlike those, this movie is extremely boring and uninteresting. The first 3 minutes are fun, and that's it.
The animation is ok, but the character models are some of the worst I have seen in an animated movie. They're gross looking. I mean, they gave them b**th0les, for god's saked.
The characters don't have any motivation, they just do things because...I guess they have to. The ""ex-pets"" stuff in the sewer is so bad. Kevin Hart as this evil bunny comes irritating, he just screams non-sense the whole time.
I guess children might be entertaining, but if you're an adult, I don't think you will enjoy this at all."
" Predictable, badly written, uninspired
",2019-07-11 00:00:00,1,"Even the voice acting was lazy, Kevin Hart was great but most of the other actors clearly didn't put much effort into this. But the writers put even less.The art style is terrible, every human and animal looks awful. Clearly someone talented did it, who could've done better but I suppose someone gave them sketches of those terrible designs to model and animate and they had to. Just skinny-limbed, big-headed freaky freaks.Again though, the writing is the worst. Everything is predictable, every character changes personality instantly when convenient, which is the main reason why no one cares about such characters or cheap movies like that.""Hey, we need a movie idea!""""Pets that can talk. There's only 999999 movies like this by now. So it's very original.""""Cool, now we need them to face a challenge.""""Well, its dogs, so... dog catchers?""""Cool, we need the obligatory sad scene now.""""Okay, someone we barely showed and no one cares about died with no details and backstory.""""Awesome, now we need the obligatory main-characters-have-a-fight-near-the-end scene.""""We got this.""""Sweet, now it's time to wrap up the movie and make everything work.""""No problem, we'll just drastically change all the characters' personalities to suddenly be friends and/or find each other. Oh, and let's license tons of great, popular music to show that we had a big budget for this train wreck.""That's the movie in a nutshell.It doesn't even teach kids anything valuable or even have enough decent jokes to make them laugh, let alone an adult.It's just a true waste of time."
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,8,Very funny with lots of great pet-related humor. fun story that kept you into it. a little over the top at times but very little cheesiness so it cancels out. did a great job of making get attached to the characters and emotionally invested in their outcome (2 viewings)
" Mediocre as a whole, but lots of good moments and music
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,7,"It's probably good I let this sink in a bit before rating it; it's one of those films that as a whole is just okay (the plot's a mash of storylines and undercooked themes and the characters either don't develop or do so rapidly) but has lots of great moments--mostly comedic (see the sausage factory trip, Hart's hilarious Snowball: ""Ricky!"") or musical--including a good feel-good final montage set to some scrumptious throwback R&B. Desplat's excellent jazzy score elevates a lot of other scenes.
6.5/10"
" Adorable, funny, and feel-good film
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,10,"Before I watched this film, I was a little worried that it might rely too much on the ""cuteness"" of the animals to attract the viewer, but I was pleasantly surprised. The humour was fun and light hearted, and was appropriate for children whilst still being funny for adults. The storyline was creative and exciting, and when the end of the film came, I was sad that it was all over. I've since bought this movie on DVD and will no doubt be turning to it when I need a feel-good film to watch! I recommend it to all, especially if you're looking for a film for all the family."
" Seriously the worst animated movie
",2019-06-19 00:00:00,2,"The sad part is I was looking forward to this film. What I saw was a jumbled, uninspired, soulless attempt at an entertaining story that convinces me further that Illumination manufactures their ""films""
with the sole purpose of vacuuming the money out of the wallets of middle-aged moms and their kids who are too oblivious to discern good movies from bad. Too bad the machine won't be stopping anytime soon."
" Waste of anyone's time and money
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,1,"I watched this abomination with my younger siblings (because I really don´t have a say in what they like). I watched it in 2017 and now I don´t remember a single frame from this puke. This movie is more forgettable than an alcoholics drinking binge on a Friday night. Illumination doesn´t care to even try to make a good movie, even my siblings didn´t find it funny or interesting. I´m not saying that every animated film has to have the care and budget of a Pixar movie, but there are solid indie/hidden gems of good animated films. This film is abysmal, don´t waste your time and money on it. Louis C.K should really re-think his role choices."
" Sooo cute! Please let me bury fur!
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,5,"What are pets doing in house when their owners are absent? This movie depicted it amusingly! Maybe all owners had thought the same even once.It's totally obvious that they hate human if they were betrayed. Everyone want to be loved.In the middle, I felt awful of the crazy scenes like Sausage Party. It was a mad place..."
" Its fine, but not fantastic
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,6,"I think this is a common theme for Illumination these days, but the Secret Life of Pets delivers an experience that I can only describe as ""Yeah, it was. . . decent."" Its cute, well-animated, nicely voice acted, and delivers a decent experience of fun gags here and there, but its probably boring for anyone over the age of maybe 10.That's not to say that you'll HATE it if you're any older, but believe me, there's a dozen better kids movies out there that parents and adults would love more than this one. Its. . . eh? It's just one of those painfully average ""eh"" movies, a boring plot and boring characters for the most part, but entertaining enough to make it feel somewhat worth the trip. I really like the scenes in the sewers with the viper, and I loved the bunny villain as well. He had a spunky personality that I could appreciate. But other than that, definitely not Illumination's best or worst, just dead center as a ""sure, alright"" sort of movie."
" Decent but not great
",2019-06-11 00:00:00,5,Secret life of Pets remains a children's animation comedy. The trailers looked promising and the film was somewhat as expected. Some light bits of humor and a story with likable characters (pets) to root for. Though the story isn't that interesting and is of course predictable. Nothing too memorable in the end. A decent film for pet owners and the entire family.
" An amusing and entertaining diversion with great animation and snappy pacing.
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,7,"Although it doesn't quite have the same magic as some other animated films, it's still fun to watch and has a likeable and varied cast of characters."
" Seen better animated movies
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,3,"I must confess I would not have watched this but for my wife being a fan of this type of movie. I am not dead set against animation though. Only a few weeks back I watched Finding Dory and enjoyed it so not anti animation or anything. I just felt this was a bit lame. The characters were not that memorable, it was not that funny and it was all a bit too hectic. Seen so many other similar better movies. My wife loved it though and so if you are a fan of pets, animation etc then you probably will like it. More for kids than adults (don't tell the wife). Just not really my thing."
" Great
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,10,This film is recommend for anyone who like pets or animals so much
" Great animated movie
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,8,"The Secret Life of Pets has incredible animation, a fast pace, a great soundtrack, plenty of funny jokes and a great voice cast which help make up for some of the more predictable moments."
" the shortcomings are obvious
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,7,"The overall effect is good, but the shortcomings are obvious. There are not many 3D shots and the effect is not strong; the plot is scattered, each bridge section passes by with too many branches and leaves; the story is always young and not coherent enough."
" Good
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,7,This film is good but if you don't like films that are a bit silly this is not the film for you otherwise it is a good film
" A fun and entertaining feelgood-movie
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,8,"As a huge doglover myself, I was excited to finally see this movie - especially because of all the hype, trailers and teasers that had surrounded it!The movie starts of great - dispensing loads of hilarious comedy that is sure to give some chuckles at least to those who own dogs. The characters are charming, cute, and true to the breeds of the characters. The plot was pretty straightforward and basic, somewhat relatable to lets say Toy Story; a bunch of characters set off to save their friend, they hit some roadblocks, and all is well in the end.As many other reviewers have commented, the movie is indeed a bit overhyped - I did expect a bit more, but nonetheless I am not disappointed, as the movie didn't fail to entertain and I found the characters to be awesome and hilarious.The Secret Life of Pets is probably a 10/10 for children, as nothing tragic or supersad happens - it's really an all-around feelgood movie with cute and loveable characters!8/10 - looking forward to the sequel!"
" Cute and entertaining characters in a too familiar story.
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,6,"Yeah, I'm not going to lie to you. I didn't expect a lot from this movie, but I had a good time watching cute talking animals doing mischievous antics.Not that it was terrible, because the voice work was energetic and delivered some funny jokes and the animation was nice to look at. The story, however, was pretty standard. A dog loves his owner, the owner gets another dog whom he instantly dislikes and tries to get rid of and they end up getting lost together and learn to appreciate each other.But even though some side characters steal the show, the film makers went way overboard with the quantity of characters. A lot of them sadly didn't make much of an impact on the movie other than following the leaders or being one-off jokes themselves.I wonder why a sequel is hitting theaters later in 2019, but what the hell, I guess TSLOP made enough money in theaters to green-light it.TSLOP is fine as a time-waster, but nothing that special."
" We don't deserve dogs
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,7,"I really liked the idea of this film and it is very entertaining. I always imagined Kevin Hart as little angry rabbit and that's what I got here. Perfect casting, well it could be black rabbit maybe."
" Borrows most of its tricks from other animated movies
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,5,"The problem with The Secret Life of Pets is that we've seen it before. This movie borrows most of its tricks from Toy Story, Oliver & Company, Flushed Away and other animated features that came before it. It doesn't really have anything to make it stand out from the crowd. This isn't a bad movie, it just isn't anything special."
" Watch the background
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,6,To be honest the vusual gags in the background are fairly good. Everything else is derivative sugar coated mindless pap.
" 7.5 Stars Really. Better than I was expecting
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,7,"Was expecting just another animated kids movie. And yes it is, but - enjoyed it more than I was imagining with plenty of chuckles-out-loud, and I was having a no-wine night as well!"
" Wacky pets.
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,1,"This is toy story with pets.
Kevin Hart is a bunny who wants to wipe out the entire human race so don't watch it."
" It was ok...the best parts were in the trailer
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,6,"When i heard that there was going to be a sequel to a movie that i didn't go see in the theater called The Secret Life of Pets, i had to watch the first one. The best parts from the first one are in the trailer, and it shows. Hopefully the second one doesn't spoil anything."
" Git better and better with every view
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,8,"Wasn't blown away by this initially... but the kids loved it!! Watched it countless time now... maybe its the hangover and it's keeping the kids quiet but this is great!! Funny, great characters and all round enjoyable movie!!"
" I loved this movie
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it begs the question do our pets have lives without us humans. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Lightweight fun
",2018-11-08 00:00:00,7,"Max the dog is lost in New York and a variety of pets band together to get him home. The film is pretty funny, especially for pet owners who anthropomorphise their animal companions, and the animation and voice talent is excellent. There is not much to the story, so the film suffers in comparison with top-drawer animated features such as ""Up"" (2009), The Incredibles (2004), or Inside 0ut (2015), but otherwise ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is enjoyable family fare."
" Cute, colorful, and kind of pointless.
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,6,"This movie is a bit of a weird one. It does have its moments where it's a great movie for kids. But, at the same time, there's really not much about this film that makes it all that special. The visuals are colorful, crisp, and adorable, the voice acting is great, and the premise is executed decently. However, this film is literally a knock off of Toy Story. The story seems to be point blank the exact same as Toy Story, meaning that no thought was really put into this films narrative. It's like the writers saw Toy Story and said ""Yes! That!"" This is extremely lazy and the fact that this got the thumbs up is frankly kind of baffling. Not to say this is a bad film, as the story, despite being painfully unoriginal, is depicted well enough to be enjoyable, especially to kids, but it's just more recommended to watch Toy Story instead, because this is just that but with Pets instead. Toy Story is also a vastly superior film with the wit and personality that this film is lacking, so me recommending this over Toy Story is close to impossible. It's still fun and adorable, sure, but it's kind of pointless at the end of the day. Again, kids and adults may get something good out of this, as it's still an okay film, but, it's not at all the first of it's kind."
" The secret life of pets

" Adorable
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,9,This movie is so cute! My son loves it and I don't mind watching it either!
" Should never get rating U
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,1,"This is absolutely terrible animation for children. Don't show it to children under 10 years old. This should never get rating U. There are words as ""idiot"", ""sucker"" and an idea of pets killing their owners so they can be free. I had to turn it off after 15 minutes of showing it to my 4 and 6 years olds. It is shameful that the studio approved such a plot and wording in a animation that is targeted at such a young audience."
" Loved it
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,5,I loved this movie! My family and I watched it so many times!
" Watchable Cuteness Overloaded Entertainer
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,6,"My Rating-6.5/10
A movie that discusses how pets behave when they are alone. Although the movie doesnt have a proper storyline and has some lag in the middle, it is colourful and funny to watch. All the characters are so cute to watch;The animation is done well especially certain sceneries are fantastic.The antagonist rabbit who exbhits both cuteness and toughness at the same time is the best reason to watch this movie.Overall this movie is a colourful watchable experience."
" Brilliant
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,9,"I loved this and it made me laugh, especially how much this was relateable with different pets. This was also great as it showed how sometimes you wont get along with someone right away but with an adventure you can end up becoming best friends. The soundtrack to this film as well I found was a brilliant addition and one that I couldn't help but love."
" Incredibly uneven
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,6,"""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a very successful film from Universal, the same folks who brought us the ""Despicable Me"" franchise. While I am thrilled that the studio decided to do something other than yet another sequel, ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a highly uneven movie.The story starts off terrifically well. The opening sequence is simply breaktaking--with some of the best CGI you'll ever see. I was very impressed with this...as well as watching all the various pets acting like pets. However, the film simply did not maintain this momentum. Once the two dogs, Max and Duke, got lost...so did the story. The notion of human-hating animals living in the sewers and stealing dog pound trucks is pretty lame....and unappealing...especially when they talk about murdering people. Instead of being cute like the film had been, it tries to get edgy and it misfires and is not really appropriate for young kids. This will sound weird, but the film was much better when it had little in the way of plot. That's one of the reasons I loved ""Minions""-- because it was less wedding to plot and more to fun and silliness. Overall, an uneven film that becomes somewhat tiresome after a while. It starts off amazingly...then quickly loses momentum"

" I had high expectation I guess

For kids it is just fine I guess.. but animations aren't supposed to be for « Kids Only » ..."
" Enjoyable comedy-adventure for kids and adults
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,7,"An enjoyable animated comedy-adventure with a big cast, ""The Secret Life of Pets"" examines what animals really get up to when their owners go to work.
Louis C.K plays Max, a sweet little dog who loves his owner Katie (""The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt's"" Ellie Kemper). Max's peaceful world changes when Katie adopts Duke (""Modern Family's"" Eric Stonestreet), a giant, clumsy dog. Initially hostile towards Duke, the pair have to work together after getting lost in the park, attacked by alley cats and captured by Animal Control.While TSLOP avoids the adult-centric in jokes of most animated comedies, adults won't be bored, helped by a voice cast including Kevin Hart (a crazy, human-hating bunny called Snowball), Albert Brooks (the hawk Tiberius), Dana Carvey (the ancient dog Pops who hosts wild animal parties at his home), ""Parks and Recreation's"" Jenny Slate (Max's wannabe girlfriend Gidget) and Hannibal Buress (Buddy, one of Max's dog friends).TSLOP isn't as memorable as the top shelf Disney/Pixar movies, but is still worth watching."
" For all pet lovers!
",2018-06-08 00:00:00,8,If you have a pet no matter how old you are you will love this!
" Great fun
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,8,"Max's comfortable and happy existence, marred only by Katie's inexplicable absences every day, is thrown into chaos when extremely large and bumptious Duke comes into the household. The ensuing conflict finds them out on the street, imprisoned by Animal Control as homeless strays, and pursued by pets from the apartments who are trying to rescue Max, and an assortment of outlaw animals, led by psycho bunny Snowball, intent on revenge-based harm.We love our pets, don't we? And we especially love to read human characteristics into them. The partial anthropomorphising of Max, Duke and Co. is cheating a bit - they have animal characteristics when that suits the movie, and they have human characteristics when that is appropriate - but that's no more than we do with our pets anyway, is it? And the fact that these characters can have both animal and human attributes as the story demands is not only absolutely fine, it feeds the film with charm and laughs.This CGI adventure is packed with action and humour. There is a huge cast, and every character is well designed with a distinctive look and an even more distinct character - you never get the various animals confused, and every one stays true to his character throughout. The look of the film is hugely attractive, with a New York which is realised in bright colours and simplified design, but recognisably the Big Apple nevertheless.But the thing which raises Secret Life above the average is the subtext. Family, camaraderie, trust, second chances - these are all issues which are addressed during the film, and never in a way which beats you over the head with moralising. The film has heart, a quality all too often lacking.The 3D could have added to this film: regrettably, it doesn't,I thoroughly enjoyed this, and recommend it."
" Same Old Stuff!
",2018-05-14 00:00:00,6,"Most movies these days are OK. Animation has become the vehicle of this moment. There was a time when we would be stunned by the incredible use of the animators craft. But once computers and their technicians go into the act and there was so much to watch, we needed something to stand out. While this is a movie about rivalries and being happy with what we have, there is no sparkle to it. There is just a lot of intense action and no reality to peak of. Yes, I did say reality. The anthropomorphic figures here need to be stunning. We've seen the chases and the splats and the tiresome human traits that have been done so often. I had not trouble watching and enjoying parts of this, but as a whole with a direction, it comes up rather short."
" Hilarity for the whole family.
",2018-04-18 00:00:00,10,"I have to admit that when I first watched this I wasn't impressed. A cute ""tiny dog"", gets a new roommate, and the two dogs hate each other so much that their walker loses them at the dog park and they have to find their way home, learning how to work together and running into a colorful cast of characters along the way. It is cute enough that I gave it another try, and am I ever glad that I did. From the psychotic sewer bunny voiced by Kevin Hart to the crazy old bloodhound voiced by Dana Carvey, the casting is spot on and every scene and line is sheer genius. From sibling rivalry to flushed pets and even metal head rocking poodles, this movie is a delight from start to finish. The kids won't get the ""adult"" jokes, mainly because there aren't many, and you will be laughing right along with them. I've actually seen this movie at least 10 times now, and I plan on watching it often. Two big thumbs up from me."
" Utter garbage.
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,1,"This movie is horrible. It has a stupid plot, insanely weak attempts at humor, and essentially spits in the faces of viewers. Just to give you an idea of how
bad it is, this movie has a scene featuring two dogs getting high off of sausages. The only thing worse then this movie is The Emoji Movie, and only by a little bit."
" I had fun watching this movie, but overall its a pretty mediocre movie at best.
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,5,"This movie mostly nonsense and filler. The plot is a mess, there's very little logic and theres a few too many poop and pee jokes. This movie gets pretty absurd. If you like nonsensical, violent, animated movies then you can get a lot out of this. Its basically just like 90 minutes of animals running around beating each other up and dream sequences. This movie has a lot of dream sequences. This movie is stupid and forgettable. Its not worth watching, but there is a small amount of enjoyment to be found in how stupid everything is."
" Pet Owners will definitely relate
",2017-12-18 00:00:00,8,"Not a Great Classic by any stretch, but SECRET LIFE OF PETS is still a pretty awesome achievement, both from a story, design, and animation point of view. There are moments in the film when you wonder how the animators pulled off scenes of such dazzling complexity, such as the one on the Brooklyn Bridge towards the end - and speaking as a 3D artist, watching the hair dynamics pf the various characters was. at times, truly jaw dropping.But the most fascinating aspect of this was how the film moves from how we see our pets to hoe they see the world. The writing is especially clever during these moments. All in all, a film I will probably watch again, simply because so much happens that you cant take it all in in one viewing. And if you're a pet owner, the final montage (no spoilers) will grab you by the heart."
" One of the Best Animated Movies ever.
",2017-11-24 00:00:00,10,"I watched this while getting well. I watched it over and over again. It is so lovely. Every character is fun to watch and the story really moves with delight. There is a lot of cartoon violence where one of the dogs is very physically violent so will need explaining if watching with little kids. But very much cartoon, not of this world violence. The love and friendship forged between Max and Duke and all their friends leaves you feeling ready for anything. Very satisfying."
" We killed our owner with that blender thing
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,10,"Max the dog loves his owner and waits by the door for her return. One day she bring home, Duke, a large shaggy dog. They don't hit it off and they end up lost in NYC with flushed angry anarchist pets hunting them lead by a bunny, as well as their friends looking for them.I watched this in REAL 3D with my 3 grandnieces ages 11 and 12. We all loved it. They managed to capture the odd traits about pets that are funnier on the screen then in real life. My favorite was the cat who didn't care. The girls fell in love with Gidget and bought the stuffed animal.The 3D effect had a number of scenes where it did some good, especially the snake scene. I would recommend seeing this twice over seeing ""The BFG"" once."
" A great premise but...
",2017-11-11 00:00:00,4,"...instead of making the most of that with original and clever ideas the movie falls into the old and tired trap with constant violent chase scenes. The beginning was lovely, but after that it's pretty much just a loud plot less mess. I really wish they would have had a strong script with good dialogue and interesting characters instead of just a jumbled lot of chasing and screaming."
" A Pretty Decent Film!
",2017-10-04 00:00:00,10,"The Secret Life of Pets was a pretty good film, It has many humorous moments and captures the movements and nature of animals very well. It one of the great family movie also... This movie provides with all the humor and the adventure as well as more Fun.Overall this movie I recommend you watch this, it has some funny moments and is a perfect spin-off to the Secret Life of Pets. I hope you enjoy the film :)"
" Very funny movie with an important message hidden within!
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,8,"(Not sure there's any real spoilers in here, but safe than sorry.) I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Secret Life of Pets""! It tells a great story that a lot of us can relate to, especially us older siblings! Max the Jack Russell Terrier has a pretty great life with his owner Katie in an apartment in Manhattan. That all gets upended when Katie brings home Max's new ""brother"", an... um... ""exuberant"" mutt named Duke.They do not, needless to say, become best buds from the get-go.What follows from there is a humorous, exciting tail (whoops) I mean ""tale"" where we are introduced to a myriad of interesting characters - my favorite being Gidget, a feisty and good-humored Pomeranian (voiced by Jenny Slate). Max, btw, is voiced by Louis C.K. and Duke by Eric Stonestreet, both doing terrific work.But it's Kevin Hart, voicing the movie's main antagonist Snowball, a VERY bitter white rabbit, who steals the show - for a very real, very tragic reason. Abandoned by his human, Snowball has organized ""The Flushed Pets"" - other animals callously tossed aside by people that just got tired of them.Sure, there's lots of laughs in ""Pets"" (some of which will go right over the heads of kids), but there are also some pretty good teaching moments, especially about being a responsible pet owner."
" An average animation
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,7,"In a fantastic world where pets can talk to each other, a small dog by the name of Max is forced to face a harsh fact. His owner brings him a new roommate with whom he must share everything. Unfortunately, their relationship seems doomed from the beginning due to differences in character and also in size, but this is about to change when they must work together to return home after the city pound catches them without collars.It is a funny animation which tells the story of two very different dogs who struggle to tolerate each other and as you would expect, they're forced to put their differences aside in order to survive and get home to their owner. It seems funny at the beginning and it manages to make you laugh from time to time, but far from the expectations I had, while the plot is simplistic, very predictable and very common. As you can tell from its rating, it's an average movie which doesn't stand out from the crowd with anything, thus making it only a good watch, bound to be forgotten very soon, although it had potential through its imagined world."
" Relatable and funny
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,9,"This movie is the funniest. I laughed through the whole movie. It's easy to watch, you can fully relate to that, the animals behavior are realistic, their conversation.. you can picture the same situations with your own pets. The script is a bit weak, it could have a better story but what really catches you is the characters and their dialogue."
" The "" Despicable Me"" Company Makes Another Great Animation!
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,9,"Walt Disney once said that the best animated films were not made just for children alone. An amazingly clever and intricately animated film for children of all ages. Yes, most of the animals can talk, but only when their owners aren't around just like ""Toy Story"". It would be a ""10"" except for: a vicious Viper Snake and talk about ""doing away"" with humans by the evil bunny and others. The first 30 minutes outshine the rest of the movie. Max the dog gets a new roommate in the form of a big lovable, sloppy, hairy ""homeless"" dog named Duke and they get lost together at the dog park. It's everything a good dog movie should be plus several things it shouldn't be. Several clichés intertwine with several unpredictable plot twists: Two animal gangs: despicable alley cats and rejected ""flushed"" pets (reptiles, spiders,snakes). The two dogs are mistaken as strays by two mean dogcatchers. ""Duke"" goes on a quest to look for his old master (who has died of old age). A ""Mad Hatter"" of an otherwise cute-looking bunny rabbit goes after them with a vengeance, then saves them both from certain drowning in the dogcatcher's truck. So many things going on including animals partying while the owner's ""do whatever it is they do"" during the workaday hours. Incredible action throughout the dangerous city including dark and smelly sewers and unfinished NYC skyscrapers. The ingenious use of many familiar songs, including ""We Go Together"" from ""Grease"", after Max and Duke have a food coma after pigging out on dozens and dozens of sausages at the hot dog factory. Overall, a fantastic family movie from Illumination Films who also made ""The Minion Movie"". Not perfect but excellent anyway. It's just ""purr-fect""! I can see why it was such a box office hit in 2016! Look for an ""Easter Egg"" a few minutes into the ending credits. It is too intense for very small children under age 6 or so although several reviewers think it was made for that age group."
" Great Movie, Makes Me Laugh
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,8,"Humorous, adventurous, and another well done Illumination movie. This movie shows the brilliance of its company and the developers behind it. The content kept me amazed and was filled with non stop fun! A definite must have for your Illumination collection. Can't wait for The Secret Life of Pets 2 in 2019."
" It's a movie for everyone
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,10,"I don't know why it got so many bad reviews honestly, it was adorable. Any person who loves animals would fall in love with this movie easily. Also the animation and the sounds are very successful. Don't hate the movie, hate the game people.It is both suitable for children and and families. There are enough references for adults to enjoy and burst into laughter and enough things that children would find very amusing and entertaining."
" Animal lovers will love!
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,10,"Hubby and I loved this movie. We have 2 dogs and 2 cats, so we got a kick out of this film. You don't have to have pets to love it, but it helps! It has a cute story line, and funny actors to voice the pets. Has some truly hilarious lines. I like that it has a message to kids/all of us that pets need to be taken care of and loved. My favorite scene is the ending sequence and I'm not going to lie, it makes me tear up. Super cute movie."
" Not much here
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,4,"Unlike some of the better Pixar animated feature length films (like Finding Nemo and Toy Story) there's really not much here. (In spite of the fact that it borrows liberally from these movies, and certain Disney classics.) Don't know if it was just a ""me too"" money grab, or if the writers/producers intended to convey more depth, and just missed. The gags are cliché, the characters are very flat and rehashed at best, boring at worst. It drew laughs at a couple of points, but mostly my reaction was ""yeah, that was much funnier when (fill in movie here) did it"". The movie clocked in at less than an hour-and-a-half, but seemed much longer. That's not a compliment - it dragged. Maybe it was targeted only at young kids, and maybe young kids will enjoy it more. It actually did seem to have more of a Saturday morning cartoon feel than a feature-length film feel. Maybe you'll enjoy it - there certainly are more than a few positive reviews here - but it's not one that I'll watch again (unlike some of those Pixar and Disney movies which stand up to repeated re- viewing)."
" Technically complete but lacking in genuine humour
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,5,"The interviews that come with the DVD are telling in the creators talk about working through a 'idea' about what pets might do when the owners go out for the day. It's a interesting idea perhaps but not really enough to carry a feature length movie. Maybe they all act like humans? It's not exactly spell-binding. OK its fun and in YouTube sized morsels it plays very well and should be a hit for younger kids. Quality animations should be good enough to carry grown-ups. Good animated films in my book all have a hook or two that ground the story in real i.e. human world reality, society or psychology and play on that - for instance the fun & intelligent Inside Out, or deliver charisma & charm like the character Rango. Zootropolis has a few great characters. The narrative in Secret Lives of Pets is lame and inconsequential, and the seminal 'idea' lost the intrigue for me early on. This is well-rendered and colorful, credit to the production craft team, but also sadly carried a major deficit in humour and empathy. Best left on repeat in a nursery room."
" Horrible stuff for kids
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,1,"Started watching this with my kids based on trailer. I actually very rarely do this, but research the movie well before pressing play. Based on trailer I figured this is a harmless cute pet movie. It isn't. I don't know what sick twisted mind thinks this is good family entertainment. Starts off amusing, nice animation, cute characters, it's basically what the trailer showed us. I started grinning already when the two main characters didn't get along, but when they get out of the house, the things get really twisted. They loose their id tags and run into dogcatcher and a ""lost pets gang"" and go down to sewers.There's a lot of detailed talk about pets killing their human owners, with a blender, the discussion comes up twice and is really long. The lead characters are made to act ""tough"" and they make up horrible stories the ""gang leader"" disturbingly enjoys. Then there is a scene where a pet literally beats out answers from another. A lot of scary action, cute bunny turning scary hostile etc etc.I don't know who this film is for really. Kids don't need to see and think of this stuff as entertainment. Kids don't need to think about murders. They don't and I'm pretty sure the whole idea went over their head, because it's not how kids think - thank god. But why feed them this hostile crap?What eventually made us stop watching was the snake in the sewers. My 7 yo said he doesn't want to watch anymore and I agreed.I'm sure the ending is all nice and friendly (atleast I hope so), but I really really despise the idea that you can do what ever to create dramatic structure in the movie, just to sort of make up for it in the end with a ""good message"" (I don't know if there is one tho). At that point the film makers have already served the ideas to kids so you can't take them away anymore.You can do a proper - dramatic, even scary - kids movie without the themes served in this movie. Look at Totoro and other Ghibli movies. You don't need baddies, violence and murder.Come on film makers, you can do better."
" Steve's Film Page on Facebook
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,7,"This film should have been called Pet Story. I definitely enjoyed watching it, but there's no arguing the plot similarities with Toy Story. It's good, but not nearly as good. The deeper messages in Pixar films are effectively expressed through some sort of conclusive compathy among the characters. That's what really brings it home in those Pixar films that other animated films often lack. When there's a collective sentiment (good or bad) among the characters in the end, rather than just empathy, it unifies everything. It's more than just trying to relate with a character. Many times, that separates the good films from the great ones. This is one of those films that holds up well and you could watch twice, but there is nothing here to catapult it to that holy realm where Toy Story, WALL-E, Inside Out, etc. reside. With that said, it was cute and funny, the action sequences were solid and I had no complaints with the voices. And I really liked the chestburster gag with the iguana! 6.5/10 — ￼watching The Secret Life Of Pets."
" Is this supposed to be for kids?
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,5,"So this seemed like your average kids movie for a good amount of time. Nothing special about it and very predictable (Kevin Hart's character is small and energetic, shocker!). Some good includes quality animation and a fun soundtrack. Some bad includes Louis C.K.'s voice, which is known for being matter-of-fact and passive, and that does not work at all in an animated movie with as much action as Life of Pets. He tries to add some flavor but it just doesn't work and comes off sounding like he's reading straight from the script for the first time. Kevin Hart is the exact same character he is in every movie except animated as a bunny. Anywho, the story is a bunch of chase scenes and then some dogs find a sausage factory and this is when it gets weird. The sausages come to life and start committing full-on suicide as they willingly dive into a dog's mouth. It's the most messed up scene I've ever seen in a kid's movie. The dogs are supposed to be ""meat drunk"" and it's all a hallucination but still: This kid's movie has a scene where characters line up to kill themselves or be murdered by having their heads bitten off (all of which is fully depicted). I can't tell how many picked up on this or simply didn't realize it because they thought they were watching a PG movie but I was just thrilled."
" More Trash from Illumination Entertainment
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,1,"""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a movie from the film studio Illumination Entertainment, whose biggest claim to fame has been the creations of the abominable minions from ""Despicable Me."" When little yellow creatures that speak gibberish are your studio's biggest highlight, it's no wonder their film turned out like this.""The Secret Life of Pets"" is essentially all three ""Toy Story"" movies rolled into one movie with three separate plot lines. The first movie about two rival toys who earn to respect and work with each other is given to the main characters of Max (Louis C.K.) and Duke (Eric Stonestreet). The second movie, where it focuses on all of the secondary characters from the first movie on a mission to save Woody, is showcased with the character Gidget (Jenny Slate) rounding up pets to look for Max and Duke. The antagonist of the movie, a white bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart) has the same character and motivation as Lots-o-Huggin bear from ""Toy Story 3.""With no original story elements, you'd think there would be an attempt to make the characters likable and engaging to watch, but no. Max and Duke start out as unlikable, and only become likable when they inexplicably begin working together. It makes sense that in one scene they would set aside their differences, but after that there is no reason for them to be working together. Then, they suddenly like each other without any reason to. Gidget is no better, as she dumbly trusts a hawk (Albert Brooks) who was clearly making threats to eat her, but the story must go on. Snowball sums up these idiotic and lazy character moments in one scene where, after trying to kill Max, says, ""We need to work together now,"" and then everything is suddenly put behind them.Character stupidity is a big propeller of the plot, but pure coincidence is too. Almost no story elements feel like they organically happened, and instead feel contrived or tossed in to make the screenwriter's job easier. Take this for example, New York City is a big place (especially for animals who mostly don't know the city except for what's right outside of their apartments), yet everyone makes their way onto one of New York's bridges for the climax of the movie without having any reason to know that Max and Snowball are there, and thus giving them reason to be there.To put it in simple terms, this movie is lazy with its characters, uninspired with its story, and unfunny with its comedy. The only thing I can really say in its defense is that the story could at least be followed."

" Not terrible
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,5,"This movie was not the worst, but other than it being a little boring, some of the references in it were not at all child-friendly. The characters were not new, and I was expecting much more. Ignoring a few major problems, the movie is not impossible to watch to pass the time. Some funny scenes were featured, and some parts enjoyable. But Overall, not what it was made out to be, but not the worst there is."
" A very, very, very bizarre and crazy film.
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,7,"I am at a lost for words. No, I'm not kidding. I honestly don't know what to say about ""The Secret Life of Pets."" I decided to watch it for one reason or another, and I'm just left in shock by what I just watched. Oh, not because it's bad or anything, on the contrary. This movie is just absolutely bizarre! It makes no sense! It left me feeling so confused that I don't know what to say. Yeah, I'm not kidding. This movie, ""The Secret Life of Pets"", is so random, so odd, and makes very little to no sense, is just absolutely insane that it I'm still speechless. The movie is in no way near as good as Illumination Entertainment's other movie series ""Despicable Me"". Those movies actually tried to be movies. They told stories that made sense. This doesn't, yet it's so enjoyable because of how strange it is. I'll try to tell the story as best as I can because trust me. It's really something!So, in New York City, when owners of pets leave the house, the animals do whatever they want. They do things you expect pets to do when you leave the house. However one dog named Max (Louis C.K.) just sits by the door and waits for his owner Katie to come home. However, one day, she comes home but with another dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). Instantly, Max gets jealous of him and wants him out of house (I mean apartment). So, after being taken to the dog park, the two get in a fight and get lost in the city far away from the comfort of their home. And now, here's where things get strange. Okay, so they get thrown into an alley where a bunch of cats are and get their collars stolen which leads to them getting captured by animal catcher which leads to a bunch of animals led by a bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart) breaking into the truck to rescue one of their allies for their gang the Flushed Pets which leads to Max and Duke asking to be broken out which leads to them escaping into the sewer, but not before the animal control truck blows up. And that's only a few minutes of the insanity that is in this movie.I'll say the things I did get from this ""movie"" before I talk about my opinion on the insane story. I did like the animation as I do in all of Illumination's movies. It's bright and colorful. I also like Kevin Hart's character Snowball. He's this weird devilish rabbit planning to overthrow the humankind because he was abandoned by his previous owner. The voice acting is good from the others, except for two. Both Jenny Slate's and Albert Brook's voices stood out like a sore thumb as I kept thinking of their better animated movies they were in last year (Slate was in ""Zootopia"" while Brooks was in ""Finding Dory""). Now, let me talk about my opinion on the story. At first, I didn't like it because of how unlikable the main characters were. Then, the movie just spiraled out off control into this madness which involves a crazy bus chase, a car exploding, a weird party that the pets are having, and a totally confusing sausage factory scene. Yeah, it is that crazy of a movie. And personally I kind of like the insanity! Not a lot, but I thought it was very out there and odd that it was fun watching.So, as a whole ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a really mixed bag. It has both good and bad, but it's the story that had the big impact.  It's one crazy mixed up story, that I liked for the some of the insanity. I honestly thought it was sort of enjoyable for how nuts it was, but I don't know if I would watch it again. So, if you're expecting a nice, funny, animated comedy with animals, you won't find it here. But if you like a movie that is so insane, so crazy, and just totally nuts that you'll have fun questioning what you saw, then this movie's for you."
" For a children's movie, I give this an A++
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,10,"Not only does my son love this movie, and can watch this over and over and OVER again, but I also find myself loving it as well. The message truly never gets old and it's everything I think a children's movie should be. This is the first movie since the Lorax that my son and I continuously sit down and watch and can bond over. I think it's adorable how he can relate to every character and just gets such a thrill out of the whole thing - highly recommended!"
" Barked Up the Wrong Tree.
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,4,"Though the script had some amazingly funny lines - like how these animated movies tend to have - the execution was too insufficient, and also, The Secret Life of Pets took it's licence to be ""zany"", way, way too far, to the point where the movie started losing its plot completely.The cast was honestly a combination of highs and lows, that ultimately culminated into a sub par cast that couldn't deliver as well as the script deserved. I wasn't aware that Max was being voiced by Louis C.K., or that Snowball was voiced by Kevin Hart. These are 2 Hollywood stars who don't rank very high in my books, and without knowing that they were part of this cast, I could sense still, the shortcomings of both their characters.The directing and direction this movie took was choppy, ridiculous, even for an animation about pets, and at points, boring, which would explain all the unnecessary turns taken in this film to keep it fresh perhaps. Even as a dog lover, I couldn't connect with any of the pets, and at no point did this film manage the ""warm and fuzzy"" effect.A pig, lizard and bunny hijacking an incessant animal control duo, that appears everywhere and anywhere just at the right time - and not in that ""meant to be funny kind of way"", no, they're just Animal Control that just keeps popping up, going after 2 dogs ONLY, in ALL of New York City AND Brooklyn... Being hijacked by a pig, lizard and bunny!An entire community of sewer strays, blocking The Brooklyn Bridge, after a bunny and a dog stole a bus... A friggin' bus. This is stupid because, this movie is set in a world where humans are not oblivious or ignorant to such and animals are expected and only known to behave like how animals realistically and normally behave, however, hey... A crocodile is getting a beat down from a little white fluffy Pomeranian on The Brooklyn Bridge, and not a single human finds this rather peculiar at least? OK.All that aside however, what disappoints me the most about this film is its well written but at so many points, either badly executed or just shy of well executed, lines. The script deserved a better cast overall, and the directing/story, ultimately was a collapsing and an incomplete mess. 4.5/10."
" Goofy with fun characters, but a stale story
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,5,"Animated films changed forever when Pixar's ""Toy Story"" showed us what are toys are up to when we're not around. More than 20 years later, that tradition of storytelling continues in Illumination Entertainment's ""The Secret Life of Pets,"" which applies the same concept to house pets (and who doesn't love talking animals). This ""unseen world,"" however, has half the wit and imagination.Animation storytellers have done an incredible job building intricate worlds in the same way sci-fi geniuses do, and the potential is certainly there for ""Secret Life of Pets."" This has yet to be Illumination's calling card, however. The ""Despicable Me"" films succeeded on clever slapstick and delightful characters. ""Pets"" has plenty of that to offer, but it runs out of steam after a point.""Pets"" follows Manhattan pup Max (Louis C.K.) whose life with owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) is turned upside-down when Katie brings home a big, clumsy rescue dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). The resentful Max tries to get Duke in trouble, and their cruel back-and-forth schemes result in both getting lost in the concrete jungle and in danger from a group of stray, abandoned animals.Other than pointing out the similarities to the Woody-Buzz conflict in ""Toy Story,"" I won't make any more comparisons, but the point is that the originality is sorely lacking. Some jokes contrasting real- life animal behaviors to personified animal behaviors stand out, like Chloe the lazy cat (Lake Bell) going ballistic when she sees a laser pointer – being wielded by fellow animals. Then there are the dogs in the park who make fun of an owner using a fetching stick. Writers Cinco Paul and Ken Dario of the ""Despicable Me"" films, and Brian Lynch, play with that range of humor really well, but aren't able to channel that creative energy into the plot.The Max-Duke saga has a forgone conclusion from the very start, and the points along the way are not all that surprising aside from an incredibly strange diversion to a sausage factory. ""Pets"" redeems itself with its assortment of characters, some archetypal and some that defy expectation. Jenny Slate's Gidget is one of the bigger hits; she plays a poodle with a crush on Max who rallies the neighborhood pets to find and save him, a subplot that's decidedly more interesting than the danger Max and Duke are in. Her relationship with a hawk voiced by Albert Brooks is refreshingly unusual, and Dana Carvey's Pops is one of few characters that keep us on our toes. Kevin Hart's cute-but- nasty bunny, Snowball, appears to be subversive of typical animated characters, but ultimately ends up being a token character in disguise. All in all, the interest level in ""Pets"" buoys based on which characters are on screen.Illumination has a lot of work to do if it wants to enter the Pixar/Disney/DreamWorks echelon in more than just the box office sense. Its movies are fun and amusing, but everything that happens in ""Pets"" feels familiar and done three times before (like animals driving cars, which we saw not even a month earlier in ""Finding Dory""). I have no issues with their films that knowingly stick to goofiness – nor with the ways this one does; they do it so well. But the premise of ""The Secret Life of Pets"" suggested something grander in style and scope that simply isn't there, and the story ultimately disappoints.~Steven CThanks for reading!

" Pretty good and cute film here
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,7,"This film is cute and funny here. It has really cute and fluffy characters in it and very good voice acting, especially from Albert Brooks who was that vulture that tried to eat Gidget, but was chained and then decided to help Gidget find Max and Duke who were held captive by that rabbit Snowball and all the rest of those lost and abandoned pets. Yep Max and Duke go on an adventure in order to get back to their owner after Duke finds out his old owner had died. Also the sausage scene had the song We Go Together from the movie Grease. which I didn't notice until now. Also Grease is still a classic. Anyway this story is a story about friendship and that the two dogs Max and Duke learn to get along after going on a long journey and this is nowhere similar to Toy Story. It's just a different story of friendship. 7 out of 10 for this. Enough said."
" Terrible movie, nothing like the trailers
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,1,"One of the worse movies I have seen. It was nothing like the trailers suggested. Only the first 5 minutes and the last 5 minutes were represented in the trailers. The rest of the movie was trash. Lots of trash talking from unnecessary characters, depiction of gangs etc was completely unwarranted."
" A well animated yet violent movie
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,7,"The Secret Life of Pets was a fun movie to watch with many hilarious moments, but it contains surprisingly a lot of violence.The pets were well animated and were very cute. They were voiced very well and the cast fit their characters perfectly. This made the movie pretty enjoyable for most parts.One main criticism is probably how much violence is depicted in this animated film, car crashes occur often and look pretty serious. Mature themes such as death and revenge are explored liberally as well. While I have no qualms with these subjects in an action film, it just feels out of place in a film about cute little animals.Overall a fun to watch animated film, but may not suit all children."
" Depressingly made family film
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,2,"I don't think I really liked anything about this movie. It was not an interesting story, it wasn't pleasant to look at, and none of the characters were likable. It's sad that something this thoughtlessly made could be such a commodity. As I watched, I just saw moment after moment of things happening without any reason for me to care. I honestly believe the story didn't matter to the people who went to see this--they just wanted to watch some computer animated animals. Much of it was actively grating, almost like the filmmakers wanted to squeeze out the most hateful children's movie possible to see if it would still sell. It did."
" The voice actors carried this movie
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,5,"Overall this movie was okay. I had no idea what the plot was going into this movie. And I still don't truth be told. The trailers made it seem like the pets did wacky stuff while their owners are away, secret stuff. Instead it was kind of like Toy Story where jealously leads to wacky adventures. I'm 22 years old. I LOVE animated movies and television shows targeted at children. But I didn't like this one too much. The good things: The voice actors. Louis C.K. did an amazing job. He talked like he was a dog if that makes sense. I did even know that it was Eric Stonestreet. I like the voice he used. Kevin Hart did a good job too, he put as much intensity as I'm sure he puts into his stand-up, Jenny Slate, Ellie Kemper, Albert Brooks, Lake Bell, and Dana Carvey did amazing as well. Overall the voice acting was top notch. The animation was bright and colorful. That's pretty important for animated movies for children. It made New York look nice and friendly. There's a point where we find out that the Eric Stonestreet dog (Duke) had a previous owner and that scene is lovely. So Max and Duke somehow find the house and of course the previous owner died and that scene is nice. The dog who's played by Bobby Moyniham, Mel, was my favorite. He was so cute and hyperactive. He made me laugh. The score was interesting. It was kind of jazzy, I liked it a lot.The bad things: The plot. It was kind of all over the place. I had no idea where it was going. First thing that happens is that Max (Louis C.K. dog)'s owner gets a new dog (Eric Stonestreet), Duke. Max is mean to him and the new dog is mean right back. Hijinks ensue as they compete for love and alpha status. Eventually Max wins and the new dog has to do what Max says for a bit. Then as they go to the park, the new dog pulls an asshole move and tries to get rid of Max. Haha kids movies amiright? The plot falls apart there. They run into crazy feral cats, then pound people, then animals that live in the SEWER because they were abandoned, then a weenie factory, and then sewer and feral cats again. The plot changes every 10 minutes to keep attention spans from running out I guess. The weenie factory scene. It was bizarre and it made me uncomfortable. Max and Duke eat so many that they imagine the weenies singing 'You're the One that I Want!' from Grease. Or maybe it actually happened. I don't know. That scene didn't really make any sense to me. About 25 minutes in, the bunny that Kevin Hart plays drives the city pound truck. Quite honestly that's where the movie lost me. I can disband my belief for talking animals but when they drive machinery is when it looses me. The dog that Jenny Slate plays, Gidget, has a crush on Max and spends the whole movie trying to rescue him. The crush bothers me because it doesn't explain why or how she has a crush on him. She just does, no backstory. In order to save/rescue someone, apparently you need to have romantic feelings for them. Most of the movie apparently takes place in one day. I don't buy it. And last thing, there's so many characters. Max and his friends, Kevin Hart bunny and his gang of misfits, Gidget and her rescuing crew, the feral cats are just some characters. This isn't even mentioning all the human characters. It was too much, I can't handle it. Anyway, if I was under 10 years old I would probably like it. But I didn't it and it makes me sad. 6/10."

",2017-02-25 00:00:00,7,"You may have heard this with cats and mice instead of humans and pets. But the allegory is what this movie is about. Actually if you saw the trailer you know the overall premise even without reading anything more about it. If you ever had a pet you probably were wondering if there is more to their life and what they were doing while you didn't look. This movie wants to show you what you were missing.Well obviously this isn't real and I'm not only talking about the fact it is animated. It also tries to give us more than just the on punchline and all the jokes we've already seen in the trailer. Which is nice, but overall you can say this is a very uneven affair. Still it strong enough to keep kids entertained and adults should have their fair share of fun too. Never mind the convoluted story and any other mess you'll most likely see - just enjoy the hyper active bunny and the rest of the crew."
" ""You got the stench of domestication all over you.""
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,7,"Before I write my own reviews, I usually take a look at some of the others already posted along with a handful of message board posts. With each passing day and movie, I find myself being slowly relegated to a long ago time and place when people could actually enjoy a cartoon or animated feature without some highly sensitive person coming unglued over perceived notions of abuse or racism. As I write this, there are three message board posts on the title page for this film calling it horrible for children and one that calls it out for a message of white privilege. I'm no longer astonished that comedians like Jerry Seinfeld no longer do college comedy tours; audiences seem to be offended by everything these days.Let me tell you something, in my day, Wile E. Coyote ALWAYS fell off the cliff, Bug Bunny ALWAYS beat Yosemite Sam, and Tweety ALWAYS foiled Sylvester. And I think I came out pretty much O.K. Right there though, that comment will garner a number of negs for this review, but for me it's worth it just to get it off my chest.So for me, the movie was an entertaining interlude, seeing it with my eight year old granddaughter who had a good time watching it as well. In fact, I'm late to the party because she'd already seen it four times in theaters, while I'm catching it at a library showing for neighborhood kids. They let us old timers in with the proper credentials, not knowing if we've been scarred for life by Daffy Duck taking it out on Porky Pig.The writers for this film came up with some clever observations regarding household pets with a story that had a couple of lost dogs triumph over their big city environment to make it all the way back home safe and sound. It required teamwork and perseverance and that's a pretty good message for youngsters to figure out. By the time it was over, even the ferocious rabbit leader Snowball mellowed out, showing that he could roll with the punches with the best of them.So there, I've had my say. For all the naysayers out there, it's time to get a grip. You can have some family fun and a good time with this movie, because not every animated flick has to be treated as if it was poo-poo with a dash of ca-ca."
" Enjoyable but forgettable
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,6,"The Secret Life of Pets is truly an enjoyable animation film that mixes those elements that work in any animated film to make it family friendly: good visuals, nice main characters, cuteness, adventure, clean humour, no hot topics, and overall fun. Besides, as this is not a movie about anthropomorphic animals, but about real pets and street animals, so it has the added flare of reproducing the behavior that some animals show in real life with humans, something that will delight pet owners.The voicing of the characters is perhaps the thing that I enjoyed the most, really great in all cases, Kevin Hart (Snowball) being my favorite character and voice in the film.The film doesn't have any hidden message, any moral teaching, or anything that will make it unforgettable regarding the visuals, the story, the idea behind the film, or the visual narrative. However, it is neither a pretentious film, or said differently, it does not pretend to be anything that is not an hour and a half of entertainment. And it does that perfectly well. Notice -- one of the pound collection vans has an advertising of the movie Sing at the rear!"
" Nothing is so secret about 'The Secret Life of Pets'!
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,4,"It seems like there are a wealth of animated talking animal movies these days. With Pixar, Disney, and DreamWorks releasing 'Zootopia', 'The Good Dinosaur', 'Finding Dory' and 'Kung Fu Panda 3' recently, it only seems fair that Universal dipped their hands into the sub-genre as well with 'The Secret Life of Pets'. Universal's animation studio Illumination Entertainment brought us 'Despicable Me' and those darn 'Minions' to the big screen, which has made the entertainment business billions of dollars. It seems logical for the studio to cash in on the talking animal genre now, since everyone else is doing it, however with an already over-crowded market for these films, 'The Secret Life of Pets' may fall short of beating out 'Zootopia' and 'Finding Dory' in both the financial and critical realms. I'm not saying that 'The Secret Life of Pets' is a bad movie or anything. In fact there are some great moments that are funny and charming, but it loses itself in the second half of the film when it becomes an action-caper movie that becomes over-the-top and even drags in its short run time of less than 90 minutes.The film really succeeds when it shows just what are pets do when we humans leave for work in the morning and go out the door. The writers and director ('Despicable Me') sure had some clever and hilarious gags that showed the special nuances of our pets that all of us can relate to, but the story revolves around Max (Louis C.K.), a terrier who has a great bond with his owner. All of that changes when his new owner brings home a new giant brown dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet). These two dogs are basically the equivalent of Mike and Sully from 'Monster's Inc.' in both shape and personality. The two don't get along due to some jealousy issues, but the pair of dogs find themselves lost in the streets in a beautifully rendered Manhattan without collars, and are now on the run from the dog catchers as well as an underground animal rebellion known as the 'Flushed Pets', led by a psychotic ninja bunny rabbit named Snowball (Kevin Hart turned up to 11).Max's pet friends try to search for him, including a ritzy and hopeless romantic Pomeranian (Jenny Slate), an obese house cat (Lake Bell), a hyperactive pug (Bobby Moynihan), a relaxed dachshund (Hannibal Buress), a tiny parakeet (Tara Strong), a confused Hawk (Albert Brooks), and a spry, old hound (Dana Carvey). Yes, there are too many characters here, and in fact, there are more in the film, which is one of its downfalls. There are just too many characters to juggle in this short time span and most characters just show up for a small amount of time for a few jokes and laughs, then basically disappear.Again, the first half of the film is quite enjoyable with all of the quirks and actions of each pet getting laughs, however in the second half of the film, pets are driving human cars down the busy streets of New York and all come together in a 'Spider- Man' like scenario climax. Perhaps one of the best scenes in the film is when Max and Duke head to a hot dog factory that plays out like 'Grease' and early 40's musical movies. With most of the characters not getting enough time for care and the over- the-top action sequences once again, 'The Secret Life of Pets' becomes rather exhausting and most unfunny toward the end. Still, the film looks amazing visually with the ever so tall skyline of New York as seen through the eyes of our smaller furry friends and the score by Alexandre Desplat sounds excellent and has the Woody Allen New York vibe to it. The film is still mostly enjoyable and has some great comedic moments, but if it just stuck with a simpler story line, instead of turning into an action film, things would have flowed smoother.WORTH A LOOK!"
" Not enough poodle death metal for me
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,6,"I watched this animation movie just because I saw the trailer and there was a poodle that likes death metal music. Since I have also a poodle and that I like death metal as well I thought it would be funny to watch. Unfortunately there are only two scenes with that poodle and death metal. So for me it was disappointing because animation movies are just not really my thing. I'm too old for that. I read on here that it's not really suitable for kids and I wonder why people would think that. I thought it was perfect for kids. Unless you think kids nowadays are still little pussies like you were at their age then I get your point. But seriously there are way harder things on the internet or on the news that kids have free access to every day. The movie itself is what it is, and that is that it's for kids. It's all well done but boring for an adult."
" Entertaining and Beautiful, but Mediocre and Self-Serving
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,6,"Secret Life of Pets follows, as you can probably guess, the secret life pets have when their owners aren't around. Max is a terrier who's enjoyed all the love and affection he gets from his owner, but everyday when she goes to work, he's left alone, waiting for her return. His fellow pet friends, whose owners have also left for work all come and hang out, including Chloe the cat, Mel the pug, Sweet Pea the budgie, and Gidget the Pomeranian; who lives in the building next door so can only watch from afar. One day Max's owner comes home with a new pet; Duke the Newfoundland, who poses a difficulty to Max's comfort and way of life. What ensues is Max and Duke getting lost in New York City after constantly trying to get rid of each other, and Gidget and the rest of the gang trying to track them down. Along the way they meet Snowball and his sewer-dwelling gang of anti-owners, and Tiberius the predatory eagle, and Pop the disabled basset hound.Being a family movie, the story of Secret Life of Pets is unsurprisingly formulaic and predictable. Max and Duke constantly try to one-up each other, get lost and into trouble, but learn valuable lessons along the way, accept each other, and are found and return home safe and sound. There's no subtext, there's no twist, there's no complexity. It's a linear story with no surprises and not too much originality. But it's a family movie, they're not exactly known for their top-notch storytelling (not even Disney/Pixar are capable of breaking this).Secret Life of Pets isn't even particularly new in it's humour. The opening montage that introduces us to all the main characters is probably the movie's high point. Unfortunately this montage was pretty much the whole trailer, so watching the actual movie doesn't improve on that. We see Chloe gorging her face on food, Mel barking at squirrels outside his window, Sweet Pea pretending to fly through canyons on the TV, Buddy scratching himself with a mixer, and of course the poodle that changes the music to System of a Down. The humour from this point on is a little lacking. It's mostly slapstick to appeal to younger minds, and I'm sure it's successful in that regard, but I doubt anyone older than the age of ten will find the image of an aggressive gang leader rabbit pooping himself randomly hilarious.On the note of Snowball and his gang, I have read some controversy on message boards about how violent this film is, and I can't say I overly disagree. Snowball's gang are quite violent and provide the most threat to Max and his crew, but they're also overtly shown as the antagonists. In my opinion, kids could do with a little more darkness in their movies, so this was welcome, but it still wasn't exactly as scary or dark as movies were when I was younger.It's a breathtakingly beautiful movie. Between this and Minions, Illumination have demonstrated that they are second to none in creating breathtakingly detailed and photo-realistic vistas. Secret Life of Pets is bursting with vibrant colour and detail in every scene, from gorgeous cityscapes and autumnal colours, to textures of stone, brick and wood that are treated with excruciating detail. I can't state enough how incredibly impressed I was with the imagery in Secret Life of Pets. An opening scene of Max and his owner going for a walk in the park with vibrant autumnal leaves everywhere, and a towering, imposing city full of lights and colours behind was so crisp and clear.While Secret Life of Pets is absolutely aimed at those with younger minds, the movie is rife with references to other properties that only more experienced viewers will discover. I often found it was a little too heavy-handed in it's references, and maybe a little too self-serving. For instance, the amount of references to Minions and Despicable Me were uncountable. Minions made appearances in almost every scene, Gru can be seen in the background, as well as the unicorn, and the gnome from the Minions short. The love of Universal properties is also rife, including The Tonight Show, and Universal and Illumination's upcoming Sing. But there's others that are a little more thoughtful and subtle, like the sliding turtle taking out enemies in a reference to Super Mario, or a lizard bursting out from a disguise mirroring the chest- burster from Alien, Snowball's revolution against humanity as a homage to Animal Farm, a poster from Hitchcock's The Birds, and an emotional reference to ""Ricky"" a la Boyz N The Hood.I know my review of Secret Life of Pets seems awfully scathing, but I did enjoy it in a lowest common denominator way. It's fun, it's entertaining, it's sometimes quite funny, and it's absolutely a visual feast for the eyes. I didn't feel I wasted an hour and a half of my life once the credits rolled, but it is an unremarkable movie. It doesn't try anything new or fresh, it makes no effort to seek longevity or classic status. It's a fleeting time that is mediocre and largely forgettable, made for the sole entertainment of children and nothing else. On that note, I can't call it a failure. But it's not a great movie. It's not a bad movie either, not by any means, but I don't feel not seeing it would result in missing out. I give Secret Life of Pets and enjoyably fleeting experience worthy of a 6/10. I'm sure my four-year old will love it though."
" Extremely funny throughout! 7/10
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,"Review: It's not very often that these animation creators get the mixture of adult and children's humour right, which is why I really enjoyed this movie. The various characters were well put together and the plot had more than enough twists, to make it interesting throughout. The Bunny, voiced by Kevin Hart, cracked me up, and I was quite impressed with the attention to detail. The story is based on a little Jack Russell named Max, who is loved by his owner, Katie but when she brings home a mongrel called Duke, Max feels that he is invading his space. After Duke tries to become friends with Max, he decides to use a fearful approach so he isn't taken back to the pound. Duke then tries to abandon Max in an alley but they are both attacked by some vicious alley cats, who steal there collars and leave them to be caught by pest control. On the way to the pound, a little bunny, Snowball, breaks his friend free from the van, and he frees Duke & Max and takes them to his secret hideout. They soon realise that Snowball is the leader of a gang, called the Flushed Pets, and after proving that they are worthy to join the gang, they have to go through a initiation, by getting bitten by a viper. As Max & Duke are not willing to get bitten, they flee the secret hideout, mistakenly killing the viper, so Snowball vows to kill them, with the help of the Flushed Pets. Meanwhile, Gidget, a dog who lives in the same apartment block as Max and has a crush on him, becomes aware that Max is missing, so she gathers the other animals in the block, to try and find Max. Whilst on the run, Max & Duke try to find Dukes owner, but Duke is captured by the pest control again, along with some of Snowballs crew, so they join forces to rescue them. Its quite a crazy story, which does go from one instinct to another but it's an joyful ride, which has an emotional ending. It does take some time to get going, but once Duke and Snowball come on the scene, it really is non-stop to the end. I'm looking forward to the sequel, which is due out in 2018. Enjoyable!Round-Up: Coming from the stable who brought you the Minions and Despicable Me, I'm not surprised that this movie nearly made a Billion dollars at the box office, and the mini movies on the disk were also a joy to watch. The movie was directed by Chris Renaud, who brought you No Times For Nuts in 2006, the great Despicable Me in 2010, The Lorax in 2012 and Despicable Me 2 in 2013. I'm surprised he didn't direct the Minions movie, which went to Kyle Balda and Pierre Coffin but it was still a good film without the creator of the franchise. The plot in this movie, is pretty complex compared to a lot of other straight forward animated movies, and the vibrant colours and various animals, really made me appreciate the amount of work that went into this project. I just hope the sequel lives up to my expectations!Budget: $75million Worldwide Gross: $875.4millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their animation/adventure/comedies, voiced by Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Jenny Slate, Ellie Kemper, Albert Brooks, Lake Bell, Dana Carvey and Steve Coogan. 7/10"
" my dog's balls
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,1,"I'd rather watch my dog sh!t for 10 minutes than watch this sh!t show of what they advertise as ""children's comedy"". Shame. Here are some of the worst lines from the movie that the kids at the theater viciously laughed at. The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. Remember to run in a straight line and run as long possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound. Your test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start"
" 87 minutes I will never get back.
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,1,"The premise seemed cute. Who hasn't, as a pet owner or animal lover, thought about what sort of shenanigans your pets might get up to while you're away? The reality of the movie, however, was not at all cute. While some of the bits are cute, and certain characters were endearing, on the whole, this movie is repulsive, especially as something that is intended for and marketed to children. Most of the action is very violent, with little in the story line beyond this violence or the threat of violence; importantly, it is much more gruesome than one would expect from cartoon violence and nearly constant. Additionally, it is very, very crude. It is absolutely not something that I would want my children to see and I myself did not find it enjoyable, partially because it was not particularly funny, well-made, or endearing, and partially because I was concerned about all of the kids in the theater seeing and hearing what I was; I'm sure some of it went over their heads, but certainly not all of it. It saddens me that children's entertainment stooped so low."
" A little feel good movie of crazy pets
