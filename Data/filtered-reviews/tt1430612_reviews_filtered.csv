" This movie is literally awesome.
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,9,"Too many people literally panned this because it diddn't compare to the original. I personally never rate movies that are remade by that, I rate it solely on the movie itself.This movie is a non stop aderenaline rush. Great action, cool stunts, good acting, and entertaining story. Also was emotional seeing Paul Walker in this last movie since he had died. Only reason this diddn't get a 10 from me was because I thought visuals could been slightly better. But outside that great all around and would definitely recommend it."
" It is not a bad film, but it is also not a good one
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,5,"I saw this film recently on television, because drew my attention the argument ave been written by Luc Besson and
the presence of late Paul Walker.
It is not a bad film, but it is also not a good one, it is a banal action film that fulfills the function of entertaining and nothing else.
I recommend it to anyone who needs to ""kill"" time."
" Definitely worth watching
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,7,"Costar David Belle is the founder of Parkour, a running gymnastics that is showcased here (as well as 2 other movies I've seen, Casino Royale and 6 Underground). His athletic ability is amazing and a treat to watch. This movie won't win any awards, but it's still worth watching for the Parkour stuntwork. Also, it's one of Paul Walker's last 2 performances."
" Weak imitation of the original French Film
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,1,I don't understand the idea of taking a foreign good movie or series because it was a hit and Frankensteining the hell out of it! Stick to the script or just leave it alone. Weak script and flow of events. Watch the original better

" Editing need some improvements
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,9,"40 min 31 seconds their driving the van but at that split second you see the inside of a Ford Mustang that suppose to be driving, then back to the van, lol I just thought I throw that out there"
" Er. Just a remake.
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,3,This is almost an identical copy of the original French version - same lead actor and everything. This version doesn't have an original take on things and it seems to be just a money-grab. Save yourself the time and find the original. Put the subtitles on and enjoy a much more stylish film.
" Acrobatics with attitude...
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,5,"Paul Walker was another of those actors that the camera loved, which is just as well because there is little else redeeming about this dull remake of ""District 13"" (2004). The plot is a straight swap - Paris becomes Detroit - with Walker aided by the extremely gymnastically nimble David Belle (""Lino"") despatched within a walled ghetto in the city to track down a megalomanic criminal and prevent the detonation of a nuclear bomb. It's end to end action with plenty of ninja-esque fight scenes that feature some seriously impressive choreography. As to the story - well you might as well just forget that; there is no suspense of jeopardy - it's just a vehicle for the star and his cohort to show off! Not dreadful, but instantly forgettable afterwards."
" A Fun Action Movie

" Great movie
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,10,I really enjoyed this film. I loved the action and overall storyline. The ending was great!
" Lots Of Action
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,7,"If you like action and if you fear that a lot of our Urban areas are becoming isolated from the rest of their bigger societies, this is the movie for you..This is Gentrification to the extreme where you have the so-called undesirables in their own territory away from the rest of society....In the midst of all of this, the powers that be decide to tear it down and create a utopia which leaves the residents in a lurch and in the midst of all of this is the possibility that gang bangers may have a powerful weapon and a serious hostage......Definitely full of action scenes from the beginning when we met our heroes to the absolute end....The acting is decent but not great but if you want some serious action, I would definitely recommend this movie........"

" It's another American remake of a great french film
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,5,"*** WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS ****There is no denying the fact that Pierre Morel's original ""Banlieu 13"" (or ""District 13"" depending on where you are located; different titles for different r√©gions) was quite a feat of a film: prior to that little gem, parkour was just another mixed/mashed up version of chase sequences and martial arts sensibilities. Brought forth onto the screen with both a rawness and a finesse coupled with true european flair (and french sensibilities), not counting some brilliant soundtrack work from Da.Octopusss, the original was both a breath of fresh air and an adrenaline rush.""Brick Mansions"" of course wished to bring some of that bacon (i.e. $$$) onto US soil and so it was only natural they'd remake it in full post Y2K americanized fashion. To say the film is bad or incompetent would not be true; if anything the film works and is well made - production, design, acting, cinematography, lighting, and choreography are all what you'd expect from an american production. However like most, of not all remakes, the result is rather ""useless""; it is just another generic american film with some instances of good from, obviously lifted and inspired by the original.One great thing about this remake is the fact that they hired David Belle who reprises his role from the original Morel film. To be honest I doubt anyone else could have done his character, as so much of his physicality is Belle's own athleticism. So having Mr Belle transfered into the US remake does help the film feel more real and less of a microwaved TV dinner.Although Paul Walker does another decent job at playing another version of other characters we have seen portrayed before, he is no Cyril Raffaelli replacement; Walker may be (or rather was) a good Hollywood cash-in name face, his own athleticism required for the role is quite lacking, although maybe that is how this american version of the role was written as. Do check out the original and Watch just how much Raffaelli can easily hold Belle's candle, although both are different martial art forms.All in all, ""Brick Mansions"" ends up being just another Hollywood remake. Touches of hints of a more textured origin can be felt at times, thanks to the obvious euro-flavours dashed into the mix (and a screenplay by Luc Besson), but in the end it feels more like a poor cousin twice removed trying to be Jermain to Michael.Now I need to re-watch ""B13 2: Ultimatum"" (yes, the original also spawned a french sequel) and figure out which of the two (sequel versus remake) is a better film..."
" Why do we build the wall? Because Paul Walker needed a star vehicle.
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,6,"Walker's last film before Furious 7 and his last fully completed performance as of course he died during Furious 7, Brick Mansions of course does not feel like an apt swan song, but is instead a fast paced dystopian urban thriller with that familiar Tony Scott editing and screenwriter Luc Besson's penchant for lazy stereotypes.Brick Mansions, a remake of 2004 French film, District B13, was less impressive when i found out it was a remake and top that with it being more of a polished blockbuster than I was expecting, I am left wanting for words. I guess I could say that the parkour on display was impressive and was photographed in the right way. I could also say that Paul Walker is as charismatic as he always was in his mainstream career. I could say that in general, the film is a well plotted, entertaining, if slightly dated feeling (even for it's time) blockbuster."
" my notes
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,2,"Some decent action at times, the rest was terrible. Horrible dialogue and acting. The only good actor Paul walker barely had a chance to show his acting skills. So much of it made 0 sense (1 viewing)"
" Disappointing end of Paul Walker's legacy
",2019-05-15 00:00:00,3,"Being a fan of Paul Walker, really only decided on watching this film knowing it was his final film of his career. Not knowing anything about this film and not knowing it was a remake (eventually found out after by seeing reviews), so can only review it on its own merit.As a film, there are some decent scenes of action and the parkour stunts are nice but the overall story and acting is severely lacking. Brick Mansions is just confusing and not completely worth a watch.Paul Walker does a fine job as this is a role he has seemingly played before. Overall, this being his final film is a disappointment as this movie wasn't great in the slightest and wasn't exactly a success. He deserved better."
" Ignore the stupid and negative reviews, this film is awesome
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,10,"I've never seen the original District 13 but I have seen a trailer for the film and it looked very good, but this film Brick Mansions is much better. I've seen this film before many times and I just loved watching this film and found it very enjoyable and entertaining to watch. The film has a lot of great things about it.
All of Paul Walkers films are brilliant and he is an absolutely brilliant actor.
This film is a film and that should not be looked down upon or unfairly negatively reviewed. The film is an absolutely brilliant film which is tense and is filled with loads of powerful action, fights, gunplay etc and absolutely brilliant acting by brilliant actors. Paul Walker is a very powerful man who is a Black Belt in Brazilian Ju Jitsu and can fight very well and his fighting in the film was awesome. The film has some absolutely brilliant acting by Paul Walker, David Belle, RZA, Gouchy Boy, Catalina Denis and Bruce Ramsay."
" Brick Mansions Review
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,7,"In a walled-off Detroit housing project, an undercover cop (Walker) and an ex-con (Belle) must try to prevent the detonation of a stolen neutron bomb.
The best thing about Luc Besson-scripted District 13 was parkour practitioner David Belle, and a decade later he's back (his heavy accent clumsily overdubbed) in the belated American remake, one of the late Paul Walker's final films.The action has moved from a walled-off Parisian housing project to a Detroit equivalent, where Walker's undercover cop struggles to prevent a neutron bomb (how quaint!) from detonating downtown.Fans of the original will feel at home in Brick Mansions - it's damn near to shot for shot - but Delamarre's lead-footed direction and too few parkour scenes prevent it taking off.Too much muscle-headed action, too little parkour (Belle is getting on a bit) - this property is condemned."
" OK But Kinda Lame Acting/Storyline/Execution - ""A One Time Watch Only""
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,6,"03/13/2019 The ""less than stellar"" reviews have it right, it's kinda lame (not even remotely believable). I'm going to re-watch some of the old originals 1. Assault on precinct 13 2. Assault on precinct 9 3. Assault on precinct 13 ultimatum This movie was at best, OK but a long way from what it could have been. Bon Appetit"
" B13 redux
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,6,"In a near future Detroit, the crime-ridden ghetto of Brick Mansions has been walled off from the rest of the city. The mayor is determined to redevelop the isolated neighborhood. Lino (David Belle) is an acrobatic vigilante determined to take down drug lord Tremaine Alexander (RZA). Tremaine kidnaps his ex Lola to use as bait. Lino is captured by a corrupt cop who he ends up killing. Undercover cop Damien Collier (Paul Walker) is tasked with recovering a stolen military neutron bomb which is set to go off in ten hours.This is an Americanized version of District B13. I liked the Euro campiness and the action of B13. The return of Belle helps with both. The Parkour is fun and ridiculous. It's all joyously stupid action. It actually takes a step down when a serious Paul Walker comes onto the screen. He lacks the stupidity and the campiness. The movie actually doesn't need his initial undercover sting. He's a little better when he pairs up with Belle. Quite frankly, Walker's character is not strictly needed. There is a twist about bomb which is very obvious. It would help to not have the mayor do his evil villain thing so early on. I do like that Lola is no damsel in distress. She's a great bad azz. This works best with Parkouring Belle with his Euro campiness although what's he doing in Detroit is beyond me."

" Nonstop action blockbuster!
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,10,"Brick Mansions is a fun action movie filled with lots of action. Parkour, fistfights, chases, gunplay etc: all that's needed in an action entertainer is here. Paul Walker did a great job, and I feel sorry it was his last movie. David Belle excels in the parkour sequences. RZA is also decent.This isn't a complex drama or something which requires to think much. All you need to do is get a DVD/BD/Digital copy, grab a tub of popcorn and watch this movie either alone or with a friend, if you like pure action movies in which mostly the action does the talking, although there are some other interesting surprises as well.10/10, because it succeeds at what it intends to do: entertain action lovers."
" an american remake of a french classic
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it was successfully adapted from the original French movie. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" I HANDLE WHAT NEEDS HANDLING
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,6,"In 2018, downtown Detroit becomes a walled in city...by a four foot wall. The Mayor wants to move the people out and build a place for rich people. Meanwhile Lino (David Belle) in a subplot is thwarting drug dealers as a vigilante. Detective Collier (Paul Walker) is also fighting against the bad guys downtown, while other cops are on the take.Lino's ex-gf (Catalina Denis) gets kidnapped by the bad guys who also jack a vehicle with a suitcase neutron bomb now on a countdown. Collier has to go get the bomb that just happened to be strolling around the walled in city in a vehicle, something he is not smart enough to question until someone points it out to him how odd is the state of events.The plot was all over the place and uneven. It appears Walker's dad was killed and he was looking for the culprit, but not that hard. David Belle had the best fight moves highlighted early on...i.e urban acrobatics. There was also a grindhouse cat fight. It is hard to imagine this botched screenplay was done by the same guy who did quality work like ""Fifth Element"" and ""Transporter.""And you can't help but notice that in this film Paul Walker crashes his vehicle at 80-90+ mph and survives because he wore a seat belt.Action with no substance. Appears to be overrated by Paul Walker fans moved by his untimely death.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" It is bad copy
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,2,"It is bad copy of Banlieue 13 , bad acting from Paul Walker.there is no feeling at all.No compression between acting of Cyril Raffaelli and Walker.Also David Belle in this movie was not like his grate role Banlieue 13unfortunate it is disappointed."
