" I enjoyed it, but that doesn't mean it's good
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,7,"Honestly theres a lot wrong with this film. You notice that especially after reading the book. Everything is so vague, you don't care about the character of chuck because you never really see much of him and thomas together (and so you don't care about his death, unlike in the book were i very much cared about his death), the majority of characters are pretty bland, and their friendships and trust in thomas don't have much solid ground. Plus the whole plot doesn't really make sense when you actually put some thought into it. BUT, i genuinely didn't care. If your watching this for the first tome, or pick up on annoying inconsistencies a lot, then this film probably isn't for you, but personally i loved it. When watching, i noticed the flaws but didn't really care, and i put that down, mainly, to Dylan O'biren and Thomas Brodie-San (the actors who played Thomas and newt). I felt like the actors did a suprisingly solid job in making me care. I especially enjoyed Dylan O'brien's performance; his acting was probably what got me to enjoy the film so much despite many of the flaws. Additionally, the fact that I'm a mindless teenager with no capacity for higher thought contributes to the fact that i really didn't care about the films flaws, it was just sci-fi-action-YA goodness to me. Overall i WOULD have given the film a 4/10, IF I did care about the plot wholes, lack of info given, large amount of empty characters etc. But seeing as i enjoyed the movie so much I give it a 7/10. I would give it higher, but i suprisingly enjoy the sequels a lot more than this first movie (I know right, mad)."
" Maze Runner develops in an intriguing and questioning way, placing the viewer beside his characters, with much more doubts than justifications
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,6,"The screenwriters Noah Oppenheim, Grant Pierce Myers and T.S. Nowlin seizes situations from other works, such as ""The Lord of the Flies"" and the series ""The Prisoner"", to create a narrative that, even by leaps and bounds, involves the audience. The end result works because of the suspense created about the nature of the Glade, the Labyrinth, the reason for the boys trapped there and the connection of all this with the appearance of Thomas and Teresa (Kaya Scodelario), the first captive girl of the place - and, at least in this first act, there are no big love triangles that end up hindering the advance of the central story - which is a relief. The script does not seek to explain exactly why everyone is there or why the labyrinth and creatures exist, but provides a cathartic and visceral subjectivity of its protagonists in relation to survival and its insertion within a chaotic scenario. Unlike other dystopias, Maze Runner is interesting when looking for realism within the impossible, to the detriment of the creation of a mythology of its own, which, for the narrative scope in question, would prove to be unnecessary and unusable.As much as some of the characters are schematic (the mysterious newcomer, the leader, the lovable little boy, the best friend, the rival ...) the roles they occupy in the general mystery are more important than their individual ones. In this case, Alby (Aml Ameen), the leader, has to present Thomas (and the public) with the rules of the Glade and the structure of the youth society created there, with different castes and functions, taking advantage of each one's talents and needs. of the collectivity. After its narrative function is exhausted, it is promptly removed from the scene until it is useful again. But it is Thomas's rival, Gally (Will Pouter) who best exemplifies this, precisely because he occupies in the plot the function of the one chained in Plato's ""Allegory of the Cave"", of one who is so attached to the system around him that he will do anything for keep it, even if it means staying stuck.Despite apparently having many similarities with The Hunger Games or Divergent: futuristic, apocalyptic, utopian, a chosen one appears to face the system, the context behind it is quite different. In terms of quality, it is just between the two films mentioned, with good action sequences and good chemistry between the characters. But the most important thing is that the film captures the viewer's attention throughout the session. Contrary to what happens in the recent Ender's Game, here the public does not disconnect from the plot, always being interested in what lies ahead. This, by the way, already leaves a feeling of wanting more in the face of a slightly open ending.There is a clear narrative problem in the book that was carried over to the film. Thomas, the main character played by actor Dylan O'Brien (Teen Wolf), remains in the dark for much of the tape as well as the viewer. The many questions surrounding his arrival at the clearing, what is that place, what is in the labyrinth, among others, are vaguely answered or left in the air for the public to discover along the plot ... or not. With that, the story gets a little dragged and the events end up piling on top of each other without further explanation. Nor do the other characters have any idea what is going on and this whole collective ""memory loss"" can be a little irritating. Wrapping the story up until the last few minutes does not work in the book and certainly would not work in the film.Of course, the plot narrative always ends up finding the overlay on top of any aspect. In this respect, the point of this adaptation is positive in any respect. The lack of memory, the construction of the 0, the coexistence and the intrigues created with the arrival of the protagonist call a lot of attention. In the meantime, the direction knows exactly the way forward, including when the changes that happened from the book to the film are identified. Fidelity still manages to maintain itself very well, makes everything flow more easily, but the title is finding difficulties in its technical aspects when the labyrinth comes into question. The effects of compositions are great, but it is the photography of the production directed by Wes Ball that leaves something to be desired. The action scenes themselves, which should be the main attraction, are below expectations. The visual effects are lost in the darkness of the labyrinth at night and director Wes Ball is unable to stage anything beyond a few meters from the camera: seen from the inside, the labyrinth is neither claustrophobic nor colossal, and the rushing moments are more like shots. shorter than harrowing pursuits. The truth is that at certain times it is even difficult to see the characters and details that could be interesting within the main location of the production. It is in the labyrinth, not in the community, that tension takes over the film.But in general, the director in his first feature as a director, is safe in building a dynamic film, even more if we take into account the limitations imposed by the script. However, in some moments it is evident that the director embraced more than he could bear and this reflects at the end of the plot where the grace of the film lies mainly in the sequences made in computer graphics, that is, the labyrinth. Because of the tape's relatively small budget, the art direction appears to be adequately minimalist. The clearing and other buildings were too primitive, running away from what was described in the book and also disagreeing with what is presented near the end of the film.The feature is about science fiction, but at the same time it plunges into a much more intimate and unexpected sphere that is based on human survival in the face of external and uncontrollable forces. We can even draw parallels here with man's various tour-de-force against nature, but these comparisons also bring their limits, which makes it almost difficult to define what this film really reveres - at least for much of its almost two hours long. However, one thing is certain: although it occupies the same post-apocalyptic level as other series of resounding success, such as The Hunger Games and the Divergent saga (which even hit theaters a few months before the feature in question), this new adaptation has its own brilliance and that should be taken into account, even if the slips become apparent as the narrative comes to a conclusion.The choice of the cast was happy and the young people gathered, with different ethnicities, accents and ages, create a harmony in the scene that is consistent with that presented in the work. With some familiar faces, others not so much, the actors develop in terms of acting only the minimum necessary to make the film work, nothing more than that. Dylan O'Brien, who until then was best known for being the best friend of the wolf boy from Teen Wolf (2011), practically carries the film on his back, doing well in the task. Skinny, he leaves aside any fragility when assuming a strong and energetic posture. Will Poulter, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Kaya Scodelario, Aml Ameen and Ki Hong Lee are also part of the young cast of the production. The five actors are doing well, although Poulter has a time or another when he is too cartoonish as the ""villain"" of the situation. Known for her work on Skins, Kaya takes on the responsibility of being the only girl in the place and fulfills the role of looking beautiful and at the same time available to take action. Veteran Patricia Clarkson closes the list in the shoes of scientist Ava Paige, in a role that should be better explained in the sequels.Unfortunately, the film does not remain at its peak all the time and ends up yielding to the formulas of the genre with the turn to the third act. After the incredible and well-choreographed action scenes, the characters end up finding a scientific facility completely destroyed and that even goes back to the scenic constructions of franchises like Resident Evil and then begin to understand the real reason for being there. The weak resolution leaves something to be desired, but perhaps it is the final minutes that return to a tip of hope for the long-awaited continuation. And perhaps one of the things that draws the most attention is the script, not because of the brilliance of its dialogues - especially because they can be predicted since the beginning of history -, but because it does not worry about depriving itself of sacrifices for evolution. of the characters' arches and even for building bonds with the public. The first iteration of this new dystopian franchise is interesting and satisfying. It is clear that the saturation of works of the narrative strands in question shows itself to be increasingly emerging within the film industry, which leads us to doubt the creative capacity of current artists; however, his dark and tense perspective is something to take into account, even for his continuations.During two thirds of his action Maze Runner develops in an intriguing and questioning way, placing the viewer beside his characters, with much more doubts than justifications. It is a curious position, but one that proves to be valid because it captures the audience's attention, which goes through the same afflicted and twisted ones as those in the fictional sphere. However, it is a film dedicated to a large audience, the beginning of a franchise that, if it works, should generate continuations in the coming years - completing the literary saga written by James Dashner. Thus, any risk must be as or more calculated than seen on the screen. What explains, for example, the happy absence of a romantic subplot - which, it is feared, should be reviewed in the following chapters. In short, this is why the ending, while intriguing, wastes time trying to clarify points that would be better off if they remained fuzzy."
" Give it a shot
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,10,This is one of my favorite movie series so far since it came out.
" The potential was there, but the payoff was unfortunately not.
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,5,"I truly believe that this could been a great movie, with some serious impact for the adventure seeking audience, though the greatness is held back by the script, performances and use of time management.Like we have seen so many times before, trying to cram too much story and character development in a small amount of time, in this movies case, under 2 hours. It ended up feeling filled to the brim with a story that could easily have been spread out over 2 hours and 30 minutes, or more - It's cut short though, both with the actual runtime, but also the amount of time which the movie spans across - 3 or 4 days, just seems unrealistic in every sense-able way.
All we needed was more time to get to know the characters and actually feel for them, so the impacting moments and rivalries would have an actual payoff in the end.Though it was pretty straight forward I thought that the last act stepped up its game, with some pretty alright surprises which kept me engaged even if most of the movie was pretty mediocre.
I think one of the main reasons I didn't quite connect with the characters was that some of the performances felt cheese, with the characters reactions to their surroundings didn't match their performances.
The script didn't help the actors and actresses on this department either, as it felt straight up dumb at times, as the audience wasn't allowed to think for themselves, as everything had to be told through dialogue and not the visuals on the screen.
At times it even felt like the concept was ripped straight out of a high school movie, about the bully and the ""weird"" kid stepping up to fill his shoes.Despite the movie not succeeding in my opinion, I think the book will. I might give this one a read, and focus on that experience instead of the movie, as I honestly liked the premise of the story and environment, just not the execution.5/10"
" why y'all so mean???
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,10,"So i saw the movie before reading the book, and it was really good. it was fast paced, had action, mystery, and honestly its a 10/10 overall. this is my absolute favorite movie and the book is a work of art as well. i'm really not sure why everyone's trashing on the maze runner because i absolutely love it. yes, the book is super duper different from the book (especially the next two) but i kinda like that. they are both excellent ways to tell this beautiful story. thanks for reading my review this movie changed my life :)"
" on the edge of my seat
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,10,I can 100000% say i was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie. from beginning to end it was so intriguing and never got boring! i love the other movies just as much too! :)
" A great start for a great story
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,9,"Although we didn't expect the story to go the way it did, the begging of the story in the maze in this film is amazing. Great acting, great start of a great story!"
" One of the best films...
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,10,"Loved this film, could watch it any day any time, felt connected to the characters, loved it so much, kept me on the edge of my seat, never got boring."
" Mysterious, intriguing and violent.
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,8,"After the success of ""Hunger Games"", it seems that the young adult film market is hungry for similar films, where young teenagers are purposely exposed to deadly danger for some crazy reason. After seeing both franchises, I feel that it is terribly difficult not to give in to the temptation to compare the ""Maze Runner"" and ""Hunger Games"" films because they are extraordinarily similar, although ""Maze Runner"", for several reasons, is much more adult and raises even deeper moral questions.In ""Hunger Games"", we saw a dystopian future in a kind of new Roman Empire where a dictator, in a centralist megalopolis called, simply, Capital, throws young couples into an arena to fight to the death, as if they were gladiators. Well, this film gives us almost the same thing, with slight changes: the arena is a maze, we don't know what puts the kids in there, and we don't know what's outside the maze, but it doesn't seem like anything good. However, the point where the film actually gains an important advantage is the mystery factor: like Thomas, we, the audience, do not know anything of what is happening, and we will have to follow the boys to find out. Another thing that I found interesting is the way in which the film is concerned with showing and developing young people's relationships with each other: we have suspicion, admiration, conflicts and, after a certain moment, crossed love interests.The film features a number of young actors, but almost all are safe bets and have already proven their talent in other works. This is the case of Dylan O'Brian, the protagonist, and the actors Aml Ameen, Ki Hong Lee, Kaya Scodelario and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. The cast's performance is quite good, and they are very committed to their characters. I really liked the work of O'Brian, Lee and Will Poulter, I think they are the strongest actors in the film. Scodelario is an interesting actress, but I think that in this film she didn't have much to do besides being the love interest of almost the entire cast.The film has excellent production values and there is a lot of money tied up in high quality CGI that makes the maze look like an amazing death machine, made by someone who can only be mad. The biomechanical creatures that inhabit the maze are equally extraordinary and intimidating. The film has excellent cinematography, is visually magnificent and makes the most of light and colors. The soundtrack also deserves a mention. Composed by John Paesano, whom I did not know, it is an intense soundtrack, with an epic and deep sense."
" WOW
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,10,"Plot: very mystery and intriguing. A literally catchy plot well narrated.Actors and Actress & Acting: very stunning work from everyone!Visual Effects: everything is in the dark, so visual effects are quite hidden but (for what you are allowed to see) they are well done.Soundtrack: it brings you trough the movie extremely well.Conclusions: I have not already read the books but this movie is very well done. It keeps you stick to the screen.
I don't know what to say, this movie just merit."

" [6.6] 2.5D leadership and chrono dash
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,7,"A fine and entertaining piece of Sci-Fi movie as its first installment.
The acting, filming and VFX are the best part. It lacks in screenplay, storyline and logic and that's the cause of it being only entertaining without too much thought spared to it.

" great adaptation
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,10,"I don't care what anyone says, this movie was amazing and deserves more recognition."
" Low I.Q movie
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,2,"The world is in trouble, humanity facing extinction yet they decided to build a maze structure at the scale as equivalent to the pyramid of Giza or the Brick wall of China with moving walls."
" It's good, not sure why so many horrendous reviews
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,7,"I saw this movie on Prime and went for it. I had no idea what it's about or anything. And I tell you what it's not half bad.Don't get me wrong, this isn't some Oscar winning film or even a film you'll go round telling your mates it's amazing. But it's a relatively simple action film that keeps you occupied and entertained.What impressed me the most were the characters. Considering that you are essentially lumped in with a group of teens, you get a really solid idea of what each are like, their characteristics etc.
The plot itself, like I mentioned is fairly basic. You won't be challenged in anyway. This can be a positive or a negative depending on the way you look at it. I personally didn't see an issue as sometimes a simple action film is what you need.The female of the group I didn't really understand her purpose. She came in about midway and didn't offer anything, I was left confused the entire time why they added in this. Made me feel like it was pointless plot additions to lengthen it.But yeah. It's just a simple action film. If you like the genre then most likely you'll probably like this. Like I mentioned it's not going to blow your socks off, but it'll do it's job of entertaining you."
" A Tad Generic, but Still Fun
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,7,"I am a huge fan of this book series. Sure it's a bit generic and the latter books aren't as good, but these are just really fun and exciting reads overall. I was hopeful that this could match the quality of the book, and whilst it didn't quite get there it was still a good adaptation. Now again, the basic story is quite derivative of other YA films such as The Hunger Games/Divergent etc, as are a lot of the characters. There's definitely a formula for these films, but I tend to enjoy the products of the formula (Divergent Franchise is the exception) so I don't mind that. I also think Gally is way too annoying/over the top here compared to the book, and that some of the action is a bit too choppy.But I think it's just stories like these that intrigue me. Seeing people in these survival situations trying to find a way out is really enjoyable to me, and this is no different. The performances are solid, the effects are pretty good and I really liked the score for this one. The action is a bit too choppy, but it's still fun to watch. The ending dragged a touch, but I mostly really like it, and think it answered enough questions that I had but also left enough questions open for the sequel. I am kind of worried that the next two installments will be weaker, given that none of the books topped this one. But overall, this was fun, and I hope that the next two films are as enjoyable as this one."
" Watchable, but not a memorable movie...
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,5,"Well, I was working in a book store back in the day when ""The Maze Runner"" books came out, so I knew the target audience for this particular franchise. Hence is the reason why I have been putting off watching it until now in 2021. So why finally watch it? Well, because I was recommended to watch the trilogy by one of my friends. So I sat down to watch the first movie.And I wasn't impressed. Sure, the 2014 movie ""The Maze Runner"" was watchable, but the entire concept upon which the story is built is just way too far out there to be plausible in any manner. The movie proved to be entertaining enough for what it turned out to be, and it was watchable, yes, but this was by no means a particularly impressive movie, nor was it one that puts the intellect of the audience to any test.Visually then ""The Maze Runner"" was good. While the maze itself was just hardly utilized, I will say that the creatures in the movie were nice to look at. They didn't make any sense in why they exist or what they were, but they looked cool.The acting in the movie was good, taking into consideration the limitations of the script and the premise of the entire story. Mind you, this is a movie for the late teen audience, so you should take that into consideration when you sit down to watch this.I managed to sit through the movie, and I just switched off my mind and enjoyed the action. But this was by no means a movie that provided me with much of any satisfaction, nor is it a movie that I will ever return to watch a second time.My rating of the 2014 movie adaptation of the young adult novel of the same name lands on a very mediocre five out of ten stars."
" Good Film
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,10,The movie was really good. I really liked it. It is a movie that I can recommend to everyone. I seriously couldn't get out of the movie for a week.
" Great Effort
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,7,"In the age of what feels like a never ending cavalcade of teen dystopian dramas, we are provided with the Maze Runner. Now I have yet to watch Hunger Games or Allegiant so I can't directly compare this to them.
What I can say is that (I am sooo not the target audience) I really enjoyed it. The performances were good, none of the characters seemed offensively cliched and the story (the important part) was satisfying.Any movie that sets up questions to be answered (why are we here, why is this happening etc) lives or dies by the answers it provides, or in some cases (Yes X-Files I'm thinking of you!!) doesn't provide. Maze Runner handles this particular aspect of the film really well so you don't get to the end asking for your 2 hours back!I look forward to seeing the rest of the saga."
" Predominantly boring
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,5,"Hero saves the day, young adult male edition. Believability low. Cringe moments aplenty. Overacting not scarce. Hero comes and thinks up obvious solution that somehow evades remaining characters' mind the whole time they were there.Some movies excel at amazing you in how great the hero is for doing/coming up with something. This one makes mindless supporting characters just so you can have your hero look smart in comparison. I don't remember old movies like ""Back to the Future"" or ""Last Action Hero"" being this bad in this department despite being made over 2 decades ago and despite being marketed towards the same audience, so forgive me if I don't accept the ""but it's for kids/teenagers"" excuse.Characters aren't interesting enough to pull you into the story, and story isn't interesting enough (except the ending) to make you care about the characters. Scodelario and Brodie-Sangster are shining lights in an otherwise bleak cast that can't wait to take their turn in overacting. These are young actors that don't have a lot of experience, so I don't think they're the ones to blame. If anything it probably says more about the direction than the actors."
" Uhhh it wasn't that bad
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,8,"I feel like people need to chill a bit, I was entertained and it is enjoyable if you aren't too focused on the differences from the book. I really liked it!"
" A good film. I recommend it to you.

" Good but not Great

" A cheap Hunger Games knock-off.
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,4,"This honestly feels like a very typical YA film.I mean, there's nothing inherently wrong with it, but there's nothing inherently right with it. The plot is interesting enough, and there's a decent amount of suspense and action thrown into the mix, but the basic post-apocolyptic ideology and the cinematography, as well as the character dynamic, doesn't really make it stand out from the multitude of similar movies like Divergent or the Hunger Games.There are better movies out there.-Sasha"
" One of the better teen fantasy films!
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,8,"One of the better teen fantasy films! Personally, for me this trilogy is much better than more advertised Hunger games or Divergent series. Less stupid conversations and more action, visually very well done. Interesting story, good acting. Very enjoyable time passer!"
" Definitely worse than I expected.
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,6,"Even if this part of the trilogy has been broadcasted a dozen of times to TV's, I've never known what is happening after the first half of the movie. I could just say that I've tried to watch this movie out of pure curiosity, because I've heard a lot of complaints about it and I've seen a lot of bad reviews too. I was so curious about what is so bad about this movie, that made people hate it so much.
I want to begin my review with the statement that the first 15 minutes, or maybe the first 30 minutes of this movie, were not bad, but after this time, everything became to be classical and so boring.
First of all, I think that the movie should have been longer, at least this first part, because I've always had the sensation that everything is fast-forward. Even if the plot is not bad and generates a lot of mistery, the story is told too fast for someone who didn't read the books.
Second of all, there a lot of things which doesn't make sense, or they are childish enough to make out of this movie a boring masterpiece. Some of the things just doesn't tie up, like how is possible that someone who is in the camp since only 3 days, to survive a night and also kill a griever? And the other camp's characters to struggle for 3 years and to not even survive only for 1 night? My impression is that this is an almost perfect example of a classical movie, with a hero who can't be injured or hurt, with a girl who is probably gonna be his girlfriend in the next parts of the trilogy and with some suspenful moments at the end, followed by the death of a character.
The only good part of this movie are the CGI effects, which are very well made. The rest is a totally mess, or at least, to classical for someone who likes movies which are a little bit more realistic.
I am sorry for my english, because I am not a native speaker and I hope that the books will offer a much more enjoyable experience that the screening did. I didn't rate it lower, because I am not so critical when I rate a movie."
" Amaizing adventure!
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,10,"Well it is not 10 star film but 8 to 8.5 is. I do not talk for this movie, I think for whole triology, IT IS FANTASTIC! Good storytelings some amaizilg plot twists and adventure with sci-fi is fantastic.Who love long movies this is one of the best to watch.If i can compare this to Hunger games, this movie is a lot better."
" Lord of the flies anyone?
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,7,"Soooo I don't want to say much about the movie itself... there is plenty enough in everyone else's reviews. I'm just wondering why it's only being compared to the Cube. The setting is somewhat similar. But that's about it.
The group dynamic was reminding me a lot more of Lord of the Flies. Be it the color version, black and white or the book.
You've got your stranded band of boys in a mysterious place. An unknown danger. A good leader being overthrown/replaced by the bad one, and the kindest soul of all dies in the process of that.
So, just my two cents to remind everyone who might be too young for lord of the flies of another great story to look out for."
" Not what I hoped for but I get it
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,8,"I grew up reading the Maze runner books, and I just started reading them again! I was a bit disappointed when they left things out but at the same time, I would assume they didnt want a 3 hour movie which was rated R. Wouldn't look too good comparative to Hunger Games since thats the movie I would assume everyone is comparing it to. I still really enjoyed it, its nice to put an actual memory base on the books I fell in love with in High School."
" I didn't read the book, I just enjoyed this great movie!!
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,9,"As usual people compare the book to the movie they MORONS it's never going to be the same, everyone has a different interpretation of a story and you add in it's a MOVIE and there us no way they can be the same!! Just watch and remember all that a movie has to do.... entertain you!!! This movie us very entertaining, great story, great cast, great directing, excellent special effects and a great set up for part 2!!! So in closing bring on part 2!!!!"

The only interesting thing is the mistery behind the maze (who built it and why). The rest is trite. Seen hundreds of time.
And the acting was really bad. I never saw so many bad actors all in the same movie. Probably is the director's fault"
" a not so good copy
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,10,"The same scheme of hunger games, but a different plot, however it is still entertaining"
" Decent teen action
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,7,"Waking up on a lift, with no memory, Thomas is thrown into a world where everything seems wrong. He meets a handful of other young boys who also appear to have very little memory beyond than the lift. Thomas has to make a life living between the peaceful glade he finds himself in, and a maze which is full of cyborg ""Grievers"" who hunt anyone who goes into the maze. He learns that a new boy appears on the lift every couple of weeks - he isn't the first, and he wont be the last. It seems though that the maze is the only prospect of escape from the glade where they are trapped. As they start to get on with life everything is suddenly flipped on it's head when a young girl appears on the lift one day.Plenty of young stars who have been in a scattering of decent films already, and I'm sure they will be seen in other films too. This is a nice adventure film which often has bursts of high octane. Some questions are answered as the film advances, some are left covered up, building up for a definite sequel or two. Based on a book by James Dashner this is a decent film which will entertain and keep you hooked.Happy to give this 7 out 10. Hopefully the sequels are able to maintain the momentum in a time where teens vs adults/the world films seem to be in abundance."
" An intense action film.
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,6,This is easily the best one. I think the action is well made and its thought provoking. Well done for a YA adaptation.
" Better than expected
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,8,"So... Another YA book series coming to the big screen, I didn't expect much from this after seeing divergent... And yes it has some Hunger Games tropes but overall it is one heck of a movie. The mystery Thomas and so we as well get put in puts you on the edge of your seat, the plot constantly moving forward with some slow down parts, the formula I like the most. As the first one of a trilogy this is probably going to be the best one, but who know. Overall Ranking: 8.15"
" I enjoyed the trilogy (not incredible, but good)
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,6,"While this will never rank up there with LOTR, Star Wars, or anything like that,,, these movies were well worth watching (great showcase of young, new acting talent).So go watch it!!"
" Great film! 7/10
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,7,"The maze runner is a great movie, I knew then it was a success but when I watched it the first time I couldn't wait for the sequel to come. The whole setting was done well and the story itself was amazing. I know this is part of Hollywood's plan of making teenage films based on novels for teens: divergent, hunger games and more. Usually those movies aren't really special but in this case I can be positive. Dylan O'Brien And Thomas Brodie Sangster are fantastic."
" Confusing start
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,9,I was reallyconfused at the beginning but when the story goes on you star to understad it.
" The best of the three to me...
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,9,"Personally, this first movie of the trilogy has been my favorite so far. I think it's because I like the character build-up when you get a chance to learn the main characters. My favorites have been Thomas and Minho. I really like seeing the day and the life in the Glade. I also like the mystery where Thomas is trying to discover who he is and what's going on. The story unfolds well with truths being revealed little by little along the way but not so much to where you're no longer wondering what's going to happen next. The acting is very good. The only part I don't think is okay is the cussing by the children. I will never advocate for children cussing. Other than that, I think the filmers did a good job in keeping the movie clean and enjoyable."
" Entertaining,Suspenseful and amazing!
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,10,"Underrated!Great music,amazing acting chuck's character was amazing at the end it really hurt,screenplay was amazing engaging till the end,story-line was great full of surprises as maze.starting felt like Divergent the intro and theme but it was standalone amazing than it!starting was impressive great intro,the mazes and truth about it the journey felt amazing.the 1st maze scene was intense and surprising,Ending was predictable but really amazing the sequel plans and the drama btwn thomas and gally and the fight with greiver and hurtful end,overall it was suspenseful,mysteriously amazing,entertaining Movie!"
" Good but ending could have been better
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,6,Movie started of well which kept me wondering what was outside the maze and whoever tries to cross the maze gets attacked by creatures called grievers. The movie is kind of survival of the fittest. The boys are called gladers and organisations that put them their is WCKD. They were all part of experiment done by the organisation due to which the outside world is distroyed by sun flare and rising of a virus called flare. This is the actual theme of the movie until the very end it just got too dramatic and silly but the movie is worth watching for its making
" Good movie
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,8,"Presents a good proposal within science fiction cinema and adolescent sagas with a solid cast of young talents who carry out a captivating and revealing story.
The maze runner is not only a survival adventure among a group of boys, it is much more. It clearly shows part of reality, it shows how we act before certain states, how we let ourselves be carried away by everything they tell us we have to do without even questioning it."
" Nah
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,1,That was a waste of time watching this movie. Seen better b movies be better and more intriguing some may like this movie I just don't like it
" 8/10
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, it was released off the back of the success of the Hunger Games but I honestly liked this a lot more. Good performances from all of the lead actors and the story is intriguing."
" Exciting plot
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"The great thing is that from the very first frame of the movie, you're sucked in. For the most part the cast of The Maze Runner is full of unknowns. I see a great career in every actor in this film. Everyone had chemistry and I loved how this felt like the filmmakers actually read the book. I'm hoping this becomes a trend with book to film adaptations. The only thing I didn't like, was some important details in the book being left out. The films premise is ""Lord of the Flies"" meets ""Lost."" Despite the 2 hour run time, it feels much shorter; but that's because it's an exciting thrill ride from beginning to end. .
Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"
" Kind of wasted my time watching this..
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,5,The movie was really slow like the last 20 minutes were when the movie actually started..and newt says they've tried everything you can think of but I can think of so many more things they've could've tried.I don't know I just don't think it was that interesting so I won't watch the rest
" 6 is the best I can do here
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,6,"Alright, so there are two more movies afterwards, so they leave a bit of unclear questions, which i guess would be answered in the sequels. But I always wondered, when the only thing you can remember is your name and nothing else...how the f they knew that Theresa is a girl when they saw her? They never seen one before. How do they know that there is another gender? How they knew what a gun is? How it works? And a few other moments like this that I can remember now. This bugs me all the time."
" Lost somewhere in between
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,7,"The maze Runner is a science fiction movie directed by Wes Ball and stars Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, Aml Ameen, Thomas Brodie-Sangster, Ki Hong Lee and Will Poulter.The movie is about a boy who finds himself trapped in a maze with no memory.The start of the movie is great and fascinating and will keep you on the edge of the seat but looses it's plot somewhere in the middle. The climax is also somewhat disappointing.The acting is great by all the characters but so as the direction but somewhat screenplay is disappointing. To some extent the movie also fails to contain the thrill.Overall the movie is good which could have been better with more filtered and crisp ending."
" Interesting concept, disappointing end
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,7,"For once, and no I haven't read the books, I found myself genuinely intrigued over the opening scenes of a film.The maze itself, with its continually changing sections, the routine of opening and closing the doors, the box - all the controls in place to manage the glazers, I found genuinely refreshing.The first disappointment for me were the Grievers. The concept so far had been believable, but these creatures with metal spider bodies seemed a little too far fetched within the general context of the movie - machines alone would have been more in keeping.The next was learning that all this was actually down to a virus. Not massively original.Then there's the question of the point of the maze. Apparently, the flare virus attacks a part of the brain called the killzone, and the tests were to activate that part of the brain. Pretty certain the cheesy names WCKD could have tested subjects in a less elaborate way.What had been an intriguing and thought provoking story, the ending proved to be a bit of an anticlimax. Still an enjoyable film though."
" Half my attention was twice as much attention as this film deserved.
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,1,"As with all these films, decent direction can't save weak source material, flaccid translation to screen and pitifully vanilla protagonists. The dialogue is ham fisted and the plot tote and well worn. At least that curly haired kid that does was half decent. Half a star for the half decent kid."
" Full Movie Review
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,8,"The film titled ""The Maze Runner"" by American author James Dashner, who originally stemmed this piece from a book, is very misleading. Thinking the film was all about a Maze, I went into the process already a bit bored and disappointed. When in reality, the film had my undivided attention and quite frankly wasn't even based off a Maze entirely. The film was a soliloquy of action and suspense that had the audience worshipping its suspense. This project was a delicacy to the film industry.The plot of the story was fantastic, and whichever way it went, I wanted to follow. The film starts out with the main Character Thomas, played by star actor Dylan O'Brien, waking up without memory, and being taken up to what is actually known as the Maze. There he finds more men around his age but surprisingly no women. One peculiar day a girl, ""Teresa"" was brought into the maze. She entered by yelling Thomas's name and the fact that she even had memory was something that changed the story entirely. Remember that nobody else had had any memory of their previous lives. From then on they work throughout the film to free themselves from the Maze or whatever is keeping them there. We later find out that the Organization keeping them there goes by the title ""WICKED."" We then find out about the virus and why Thomas and his friends were kept in the Maze.The acting throughout the film was solid and the way the actors made us feel throughout the performance was invigorating. When Thomas, played by actor Dylan O'Brien, and the other Runner ""Minho,"" played by actor Ki Hong Lee, were stuck in the maze and being chased by the giant, robotic-like spider, the devastation and weary on their face was unforgettable and the way they made the manhunt feel like it was almost after me was unearthly. The expressions on their faces alone and the way they made every situation so real was really a work of art and win for the actors. Now stating that, I also want to say that Dylan O'Brien did put on an unforgettable show with this film. We know he's been in many other hit shows and movies with his work in Teen Wolf or American Assassin. Dylan made this movie what it is, he created the atmosphere and when he's on the set, everyone is on top of it. The directing was a very good representation of what Wes Ball can do. This film was his directing debut, and The Maze Runner is what made his career, it's what he's most known for. I'm looking forward to another West Ball movie production.The cinematics were above average along with the makeup and costumes. The film setting was perfect for the stranded situation and just how the maze kept changing and turning must've taken a lot of work for cinematography like that. Also, the makeup and costume styles were a great way to show how it was in the maze. When Thomas came up through the elevator into the maze, he was wearing some rugged pants and a t-shirt that were definitely old and worn down. That's not something I would choose to wear, especially if I knew I'd be stuck in this maze for as long as it takes me to find a path out. It proved that someone put him in those close and was ultimately the mastermind behind this Maze. The way that the ""Virus"" looked after someone was stuck by it was intense and realistic. It looked as you would imagine it, as if you'd just had it described to you like a snake bites venom flooding your veins.The production left us on a cliffhanger, and I wish it hadn't. I was very impressed with this film, and I'm looking forward to the next part in the series."
" One Word amazing
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,10,I dont know why People relate the book to the movie they can't just take All the details and I wasnt thay disappointed to be honest the movie is pretty good the movie is so underrated.
" Young-Adult Movie
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,5,"This review contains spoilers.The Maze Runner is a dystopian science fiction movie that premiered in 2014. The movie is directed by Wes Ball and is based on the novel The Maze Runner by James Dashner. The movie stars Dylan O'Brien, Kaya Scodelario, and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. The movie follows a group of young adults that are trapped in a maze. All of the boys are young adults and have no memory of how they got to the maze. The group must solve the mystery of the maze and exit the trap.The Maze Runner is a quintessential young adult movie. There are many tropes that are found in the young adult movie. The movie plays these tropes straight. This is not a movie for audiences that are expecting something different in the young adult genre. The movie genuinely plays these tropes straight with its protagonists and plot structure. The movie is not boring as the mystery in the movie is still exciting to watch.The movie is well made with the effects and cinematography at a high standard. The sets and acting are surprisingly well done. I normally expect movies such as this to be a lower production but The Maze Runner did a good job with creating the traps and shifting maze. It made for a good experience as the movie dazzled the audience with its effects and urgency in the protagonists.The movie's plot and mystery is not explained by the end of the movie. Although I liked the mystery, I felt that the movie's end only raised more questions as to how the group ended up in the maze. I felt that this was the disappointing part of the movie as the movie did not want to answer any of the mysteries that the story had setup. It required the audience to be invested in the sequel which from the ending of the movie does not seem as interesting as this movie.I would recommend 'The Maze Runner'.Grade: C"
" MAZE RUNNER IS GREAT!!!
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,10,"The MAZE RUNNER trilogy is by far the most creative, exciting, heartwarming, intense, action packed movies I've ever seen and if your 13 + you should definitely see it, it is full of surprises no one would ever think of, seeing the maze runner trilogy changed my life and are my top three favorite movies and at the beginning of the first movie you won't expect what will happen next, the end of the first movie will surprise you the most, you might have to see them all 7 times each if you've seen the movies you will know what I'm talking about but I don't want to spoil it so have fun and watch it !!!"
" Interesting world building mixed with some rote storytelling make a mixed experience
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,5,"Oh, the early to mid 2010s, when men were men, women were women, and teenagers were constantly being pitted against an all-oppressive state with absurd contraptions and concepts that fostered some kind of twisted growth. They were more innocent times, really.So, the king of these films (really, the queen) was The Hunger Games a good series of 4 (should have been 3) films based on a young adult dystopian novel series. Soon, everyone in Hollywood was doing what they always do, mimicking the recent success. The Maze Runner came out of that time.A young man, Thomas, wakes up in a dingy elevator rising to the surface. He finds himself in a green space at the center of a square of walls hundreds of feet high with only a few dozen other boys already there. What surrounds the little idyll is the Maze, a series of shifting passageways that opens up at the beginning of the day, closes as night approaches, and contains nasty beasts at night. Well, being this kind of movie, of course Thomas is going to become the guy who leads them through the Maze somehow. It's not really a surprise.And therein lies the movies failing. Its utter predictability. Of course Thomas is the ""chosen one"". Of course he's going to do things that people who've been there for three years never tried or succeeded at. Of course he's going to cause a paradigm shift in the society. Of course he's going to lead them out.The other failing is the incredible shallowness of characters. They're little more than archetypes that exist to fill rolls. The largest problem is with the ""antagonist"" Gally. He's angry and paranoid, and little else. I feel like he was placed there because the movie, without him, essentially has no antagonist except the Maze itself. He's there to stir things up and make life just a little more difficult for Thomas, but the situation around them is enough of an antagonist. Thomas' presence changes the rules of the situation in certain ways that the painfully expository dialogue makes very clear. Gally is just extra, and feels it.But still, the movie's slickly produced so it has some surface level appeal. The movie was obviously made on the cheap side of blockbusters, but it uses its limited budget well. The maze looks good. The monsters look good. The action scenes engage on a purely sensory level. The acting is also pretty good, even if it is split across too many characters.I didn't hate the experience. It was an okay way to spend 100 minutes of my evening. The promise of more of the world is intriguing enough to get me sort of interested. All around, meh."
" Better then expected
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,8,I went into this thinking it was going to be a very average film but I was very wrong. The story was good and It was moderately easy to follow. I'm definitely going to watch the second one and hope it as good if not better then this one.
" Filmed in the dark to save money?
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,2,Really difficult movie to enjoy as all the action is hidden in shadows and poor lighting. It's a noisy movie.
" Hooked
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,10,"The movie is like the discribtion, Dylan and Thomas are perfect for this movie. I enjoyed watching this a lot and got the rest of my family hooked."
" Watch the entire trilogy as 1 movie
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,8,"I did not read the book.I watched the trilogy in 1 go, treating it like a 6-hour long single movie.Watch it that way and it works :)Watch any of the 3 episodes alone and it will not work (hence the many bad reviews here)"
" More pls for the fandom of this movie
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,8,"I love Dylan O'brien, such a good actor I am so happy that he got recognition after playing in teen wolf where he played very good as Stilinski. I hope they make more of these movies of maze runners."
" Great start of the series
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,8,Usuall these kind of movies are too unrealistic and have way too many annoying characters (kids especially). But not this one. Refreshing.
" Very Interesting
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,8,This is one of the most interesting post-apocalyptic movies so far. It's original and I found myself incredibly dedicated to finding out the secrets of the maze along with Thomas and the rest of the boys. This movie is engrossing and anyone a fan of the genre will enjoy.
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,4,"I dunno, I just didn't really like it. hard to describe why. it just didn't do it for me. It kind of dragged at times and the discovery process wasn't anything special in finding out what was really going on (1 viewing)"
" Fantastic but not for everyone
",2019-05-29 00:00:00,9,"Its awesome but not everybody like this kind of movies,only the one who can think..."
" An awesome film with a flaw.
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,10,"The Maze Runner is one of my favourites film series of all time. Although I haven't read the novel yet, but I love the film version very much. In the film, there are some things that they have changed and a bit different from the novel, still, the film makes sense (except for one thing) and I still love it.One thing I don't understand to this day is that when they (Thomas, Newt, Minho and the others) finished the trial, then they found the room and play Ava's message. After that they found Gally. So, my question is how did Gally make it out? I mean he doesn't have a key and the path they used, it already is sealed. And when they passed, there was no sign of Gally. So, Gally's appearance in this room is literally impossible. (Unless Gally is a spy from WICKED to stop the others from getting out of course.) And they didn't explain it. I don't know about the novel. I don't know how it went in the novel. Maybe it might be different. I think I have to read the novel to know about it.Overall is that except for that fact described in above, the film is quite good and enjoyable."
" Hunger Games?
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,4,"The Maze Runner is one of many young adult novel movie adaptations that plan the series before movie one. As far as these types of movies go however, this one is one of the better. The good part of the film is the time spent within the maze, luckily this is most of the film so it is totally watchable. While having character, the main group is very one dimensional and throughout there is never a moment when they are force to make a particularly hard moral decision. The beginning is the best part because the small society manufactured within the maze is interesting to learn about, however the rest of the film involving the outside world is very cookie-cutter."
" I simply enjoyed it
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,8,"Yes, it has its drawbacks. At some point it was illogical or too contradictory but there were more than a few scenes that left me speechless."
" A fun movie if you lower your expectations
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,6,"I liked it. A poorly scripted, but well executed sci-fi dystopian action movie.
Nothing too fancy, nothing too bad.
I completely agree with the reviewers pointing out the shortcomings, I just don't know what you'd expect. If you told me this thing got a few Oscars I'd be stunned but knowing this is a mediocre sci-fi that attempts to create an somewhat original reality - I'm fine with it.
Sure, highly dosed suspencion of disbelief is needed and the acting isn't amazing either.
So I guess my final verdict is this: If you have to pay more than 1-2$ to see it it's probably not worth your money. But if you get a cheap deal or just wanna have fun - it won't kill you."
" Minho is love Minho is life
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,10,Tbh Thomas was not my favourite....... as you can guess from the title it was Minho😁 this movie gripped me from the beginning and I loved the scorch trials also ( Brenda was one of my favourites from that one. The death cure was long and I was kinda bored but I'm glad they rescued Minho! When newt died I tried not to cry ( I was in the cinema with some other people) and also when winston died in the second i did cry a bit ( that was a really sad part especially when you hear the gun going off)
" One thing only
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,1,"I have some questions. The soldiers picked them up with a helicopter. The maze had no roof. Why not pick them up by flying over the maze in the first place. Since they were the hope of humanity due to virus immunity, why put them in the middle of a maze, memory washed, in a daily danger and why sending the beasts to exterminate them at the end? Because they found a way out? Come on!!!! They should be treasured. Stupid movie no reason to existing full of plot holes."
" Very exciting movie
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,9,"This film makes me very excited since many characters face a lot of dangerous situations in order to save their life. The main character thomas is really suitable for main in this film in terms of his personality such as braveness, self confidence, and risk taker.
If i get in this situation, I would not sacrifice myself in order to improve my life. This movie also depicts the deep human relationships through romance and fighting. I like the all character in this film and want to watch it again."
" the rhythm and plot are well controlled
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Yes, the rhythm and plot are well controlled. Overall sense, in the same type, is significantly better than the divergent, and is equivalent to the hunger game. Of course, small hard injuries are not without them. For example, 8-digit passwords, how the order of each area is determined"
" The maze runner is an excellent movie.
",2019-02-11 00:00:00,9,"It's the story in which there are teenagers who have lost they memories, they wake up, trapped in a maze with dangerous creatures in the future after a virus has exterminated a part of the population. They have to survive and find the way out.It is directed by Wes Ball and the genres of the movie are sci-fi, action and adventure. I find the cast great because there are actors as Dylan O'Brien, Thomas Brodie Sangster, Ki hong lee and Kaya Scodelario. To me, Dylan O'Brien is the most talented actor because he is the funniest and he is sad and happy when he wants.The maze runner is an American movie released in 2014. It is written by Noah Oppenheim and James Dashner. The production company is 20th century fox.The fights between the creatures and the characters are extremely real, the special effects are really amazing I have never seen anything like it. I haven't a favourite moment because it's impossible to choose a scene.When the main character, Thomas, discovers the maze, there is a stressful and very adventurous music, it's my favourite music in the movie. The maze runner is the movie I have seen the most and it's my favourite movie because there is action and it's an original and strange story. ."
" Kids ruining a movie...
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,1,And they do it flawlessly.Naturals.Anoying.Holy crap. This movie really suck. Casting has failed completely.I'm not even sure what the movieis about. The kids always ends up being in my way.

",2019-01-30 00:00:00,6,"The maze runner is an American science fiction dystopian action thriller movie directed by Wes Ball, based on the novel with the same name.

Scorch trials is the second series and the death cure is the third series of the maze runner. The sound effects are not bad and are not disappoint at all.

" Not a perfect movie but entertaining
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,7,"Although this is not a perfect movie , it's still interesting . It will not waste your time by watching this film but for my opinion the book is better."
" Entertaining Sci Fi Thriller
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,7,"19 October 2014. The Maze Runner combines The Hunger Games (2012), Cube (1997), with Lord of the Flies (1990) into a rather fascinating mystery thriller for boys. For most of the movie, the consistency of theme and plot holds up well. The tension, the ever presence ominous sounds of the maze offers up a dread that is pervasively creepy. The stereotypical characters aren't usually overplayed and the over the top performances or plot points are mostly held back using instead more empathetic and humanistic portrayals.The ending seems like a cop out for a hoped for sequel unfortunately. And there a few moments that really do fall back into the stereotypical plot design. The humor however makes their appearances with to great effect though. This is more enjoyable movie than expected. It just misses out though being really innovative and can't quite break out of the mold of most of the other sci fi thrillers."
" Not another teen movie (no really, it isn't)
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,5,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Don't get me wrong, the teen movie aspects were still not very good. However, the action sequences were unexpectedly exciting, making it worth watching."

",2018-12-31 00:00:00,8,"I always like action scenes in movies, but this movie could have been longer to have more action scenes, and could have been more better, these are the problems of the movie, but actually i watched this movie always since 2015 and i still enjoy it up to now"

great movie along with great story,good setting really loved it.
great adventure,epic and great fantasy.good approaches has used to design a maze. clear story."
" Good but could be better.
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,8,"I like the plot and the characters. Yeah, they should've made the plot easy to understand but this is way better than The Hunger Games and Divergent. Have you seen Divergent, that is probably the worse movie in history.😂"
" Film is satisfactory In suspence
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,8,"The movie is excellent, writing, actors/actresses were great, scenes were emotionally moving and length of film is good. I am pretty good at predicating most films, this movie surprised in most scenes and that grab my attention. Remember it is very emotional and fun too.Great Movie its worth your time.."
" Happened to run into this great movie!
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,10,"Your legs carry you through life and they also carry you through the most toughest, most exhilarating moments in your life. The main character, Thomas, of the Maze Runner had to experience just this. Being an American dystopian, science fiction film, it is filled with action and thrilling moments. Directed by Wes Ball, the Maze Runner was his directorial debut. The movie was based on the 2009 novel, the Maze Runner, written by American author James Dashner. Following the storyline, the movie depicts the book on the big screen making it come alive. Released on September 19, 2014, the film topped the box-office with a $32.5 million debut and also earned over $348 million worldwide. For a movie that only had a budget of $34 million, their profit definitely showed it up. While the Maze Runner ended with a victory for (some of) the Gladers, their story did not end there. Continuing from the first film, a sequel called Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials was released one year later to continue the adventures of the teens. Later on after the second film, a third and the final film was released three years after the other sequel. Known as Maze Runner: The Death Cure, this would come to be the final film in the Maze Runner series. Although the Maze Runner is derived from a book, it is a movie that is worth watching because of its compelling visuals, action packed plot, and unexpected twists that keeps the audience on their toes.
 Starting the movie off, the main character finds himself on this mysterious lift, with it clear that he had no clue what his name was. After arriving, he finds other boys that went through the same thing he had just experienced. He learns that he has been delivered to the middle of a constantly changing, intricate labyrinth. He also finds out a crucial information about how no one has ever survived a night in the Maze. He regains knowledge of his name and also learns about there is a set group of boys named the Runners that search the Maze everyday for an escape route. The following day, Thomas was attacked by a ""Runner"" which turns out had been stung by a creature from the Maze called a Griever. The Runner that got stung was forced to enter the maze to be left to die as there is no current cure for his condition. Every night the Maze closes and every morning the Maze reopens. The following day, Alby, the group leader, and Minho, the lead Runner, enter the Maze to trace the Runners steps. After spending the whole day inside the maze, the group is worried for the two as the Maze is getting close to closing for the night. The Maze starts closing and at that second Minho reappears dragging a stung Alby. It is shown as the two will not make it in time to get out of the Maze. Thomas springs into action and runs into the Maze to help but with no avail, all three of them are trapped. While it is said that no one survives the maze, Thomas is the one to prove that saying wrong. The trio manages to survive the night and return the next morning, shocking everyone. After being upgraded to a Runner, Thomas strives to find an escape route for everyone.
 This movie is worth watching due to the fantastic characters that were so well depicted by the actors. My personal favorites are Thomas and Minho, played by Dylan O'Brien and Ki Hong Lee. They acted out the emotions of the characters really well, especially the part I just mentioned of them being trapped in the Maze for a night. Ki Hong Lee had a look of utter hopelessness and panic while Thomas was the one to really make sure that they had the chance to make it out alive, he had a look of determination. Just watching the whole situation get solved out is worth watching in itself. The movie definitely keeps you on your toes making you want to find out what is going to happen next and if they will ever make it out of the labyrinth. Speaking about the labyrinth, while it is supposedly scary, it really exudes a beautifully haunting aura. Not only that but the movie has some very compelling visuals. Especially at the end where they showed us a bird's eye view of the whole labyrinth, the visuals were so detailed and breathtaking. These are just one of the many factors on why you should give the Maze Runner a try.
 While there are many negative opinions on this film, I believe some of these arguments are not valid. One person argued that the movie was horribly boring. As someone who personally has the urge to skip sections of films, I personally did not have a moment where I wanted to fast forward. While the movie is not always packed with action 24/7, the movie does contain enough suspenseful moments that keeps the audience on their feet. For example, the part where Thomas (the main character) is trying to escape a Griever that was out to kill him. I mean watching someone trying to escape death can't possibly be boring. Another person critiqued the movie not being suitable for anyone over the age of 10. However, this argument definitely contradicts the fact that the movie is PG-13. I mean, I do not think a normal 10 year old kid (or younger) would like to watch violence and something that is classified as a thriller. I would also believe they would not get the plot as it gets pretty complicated towards the end.
 Now you must be wondering why I am writing a review on a movie that came out years ago. Well while I was on the plane back to Honolulu from my trip, I obviously wanted to take advantage of the free movies available on the flight. With that in mind, I got all settled with my blanket, jacket, and neck pillow to keep me warm and pulled out my cheap earphones I got in from my trip (that worked way better than the complimentary ones the flight gave out to everyone). While flipping through all the movie selections, I just so happened to run into the movie Maze Runner.(Not a pun I swear) After remembering all the hype people gave the film when it first came out, it convinced me to give it a try. My first reaction was, ""Wow, this is some hunger game movie"" when I saw the main character trapped in a mysterious elevator. Like those dystopian style movies, the movie Maze Runner is very high in action, suspense, and unexpected twists. Luckily for me, I enjoyed those types of movies. As Dylan O'Brien emerged from the light, the look of panic surprised me and quickly got me intrigued to what was to happen next. He struggled to find a way out but quickly gave up after realizing that he had no way to go. When he finally arrived at his destination, the Glade, he would come to be one of the most important boys in that community. This definitely interested me and had me wondering how the newcomer would come to finding the solution to the issue everyone had been trying to solve for years. 
 While there seems to be a lot of critical reviews on this movie, one should definitely give it a try despite these negative critics. You never know unless you try! With the actors' compelling emotions, shocking plot twists, and visuals, this movie definitely is worth a try. Legs are an essential to life, this movie definitely shows how legs carry you the most exhilarating moments of your life. In conclusion, the Maze Runner is definitely a movie that is worth watching because of its compelling visuals, action packed plot, and unexpected twists."
" Promising concept, but ultimately a let down.
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,5,"Although the concept is promising, the plot feels cobbled together and the explanations it gives simply don't satisfy the audience's curiosity. Some of the acting is good and shows real emotion, but the characters and their traits are typical and predictable. The monster chase and action scenes look good due to the special effects rather than the dark and shaky camera work that is employed."
" A good adaptation, but not a great movie
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,6,"The Maze Runner is good, not great. I understand why they made certain changes to the story, to make it play better on the screen, but other changes just seemed unnecessary. The young actors did pretty well, though, and the scale of the set was impressive. Also, much like the book, this movie can't stand on its own, so I look forward to see how they do the next installment."
" Fun interesting action film that adds a heap of mystery
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,9,"Really love this movie but I don't believe it's going to stand the test of time, this movie isn't too memorable although this movie is really well done. Some of the scenes are very captivating and the whole plot of the movie being the maze is a mindblowing mystery in the first time you watch it , you really get into it and you can relate with most of the characters within the movie."
" Don't take it personally.
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,8,"Yikes. Some of these reviews make it sound like the movie personally came to each of their homes and assaulted the reviewer themselves. Jeez. Let up people. I'm only reviewing this to help maybe nudge the rating to a solid 7. I found this movie quite enjoyable. Lots of suspense. Confusing at times. And more tense than the Hunger Games, I thought. And the acting wasn't bad. I thought the lead was quite good, though at first I mistook him for Logan Lerman, which may have increased my positive associations. Anyway, give it a watch. I feel like a healthy critique would put it between a 6 and an 9. Sheesh. Breathe, people."
" An average ND predictable movie
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,5,"Nothing great nothing boring but it was an average movie without any explanation just boys running around ND fighting . It had the potential but it was lost throughout the movie no suspense no thrill . Kind of boring, rather predictable.its a 1 time watch"

" Lots of Running
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,5,"The film is full of running, lots of it and the characters barely break sweat at times.It never really felt like a film, more a TV show, where you watch the first two of eight hours. It would have been better making it apparent from the start, that there would be no real ending and it would lead to a further part.It was ok, a few good scenes, I stuck.with it, but it is a bit of a mess and full of cliches and inconsistencies. Too many of the residents seemed oddly content and at ease with being there, the female character served little purpose and how one of the characters who chose to stay in the camp, then miraculously ended up outside made no sense.5/10"
" Good movie
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,8,All round decent movie with some interesting concepts. Acting/plot is weak at times but forgivable.
" favourite movie!!
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,10,"My all time favourite movie! literally the best movie i've ever seen. i just cant explain how good this movie is, all scenes are perfectly made to attract your interest. i've watched all of them till the third part/movie dont know if a fourth one will come out but im hoping so! all of the 3 movies made me cry! i definitely recommend this movie to anyone especially if you like action! because this movies always keeps you entertain and interested on what is about to happen!"
" YAWN!! Why, why, why??
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,2,"The film provides more questions than answers. The characters are idiotic just accepting their 'fate' and no-one asks any relevant questions. The things they do is not believable at all, as I can't believe people in their situation would act they way they do. Why do they keep so many secrets, only later to reveal they didn't know the answers anyway, so why didn't they rather talk about it and tried to find solutions instead of forming cliques and fighting among each other?Also, WHY would any company built such a huge maze without any means of making a profit??? Where did their funds come from? WHY would they kill people they are trying to learn from?? WHY would they built 'monsters' to threaten the existence of the last few survivors on Earth? WHY would they built a maze that shifts? The planning alone would have taken ages and where did they find the time to do this in a post-apocalyptic world? The money could surely have been used to build domed cities or to assist the survivors instead of building this glorified cage (uh, yes, that's how I see it). Seriously, NOTHING in this film makes sense!Having to sit through this was like being tortured. Please, stop, I'll tell you anything, ANYTHING!! Just hit the STOP button, or even better yet, EJECT. There is no way I'll be watching the sequels, as I don't think I'll survive the torture..."
" First instalment in a solid dystopian science-fiction trilogy with a cast of youths
",2018-06-05 00:00:00,7,"Based upon the novel by James Dashner, The Maze Runner is the first instalment in a dystopian trilogy that follows a group of youths as they fight for survival and against manipulation in a desolate world destroyed by heat and disease. This first movie follows a very young man who awakes in an elevator that transports him to a group of male youths that is living in a restricted natural environment surrounded by a gigantic maze. This society calls itself the Gladers. The young man doesn't remember his past and only recalls his name after a few hours of confusion: Thomas. He soon realizes that the other boys and men share his fate. They have established some basic rules to live together in peace and harmony as everybody has specific tasks to do. The most important group of people are the athletic runners who go inside the maze when it opens up in the morning and return late at night before the gates close again. The runners are trying to solve the maze to find a way out. However, there are mechanical creatures called grievers who live in the maze which can attack, kill or sting their human victims in a way that makes them go berserk. Thomas is a curious individual who doesn't like following rules and his appearance soon devides the group of youths. Some people support him as they believe he can help them solve the maze while others have gotten used to their lives in a restricted environment and consider him a nuisance. Things take a more dramatic turn when a last human being is sent up the elevator: a girl named Teresa who seems to know Thomas from the past.There are several elements that make The Maze Runner stand out positively. The idea to live the story through the eyes of the charismatic Thomas who gradually tries to find out what is going on around him makes the film captivating, mysterious and suspenseful. The fact that the film takes place in a restricted environment soon leads to quite intense relationships which help the story move forwarde. Most viewers will identify with one character or another. If compared to similar dystopian films, this movie doesn't seem to overuse special effects which gives it a more authentic atmosphere. The final half hour is quite tense and violent and leads to a bittersweet finale. On one side, one finally gets some important background information that explains most of that happened in the first ninety minutes but on the other side, the new answers lead to even more questions as the movie ends on a cliffhanger which almost makes it mandatory to watch the second instalment as well. If you're not planning on watching a trilogy, don't watch this movie in the first place.The story also has a couple of flaws. The background story seems surprisingly basic and is lacking many details. Some events in the story are illogical or simply left unexplained such as the Glader who got stung outside the maze which is never fully explained. The story obviously also has some similarities to other dystopian movies, especially concerning the bleak future of our planet and the basic main protagonists and antagonists. The movie's middle section is somewhat plodding and the movie could have been shortened by about ten minutes without leaving out anything essential.In the end, you will like this film if you're a fan of other dystopian science-fiction movies with a set of young characters like The Hunger Games or The Divergent Series. The unique setting and the mysterious plot certainly make this movie stand out. If you are looking for a creative and unique experience, you might find the movie somewhat boring and predictable."
" AMAZING
",2018-05-26 00:00:00,10,I would waste every second on this movie. People are saying don't waste your money.... well i'd waste every cent. Not every book's movie has to be perfect. I have never read the book and this movie is amazing. even if i read it it wont lessen my rating for this movie it was great!! i recommend it. I have re watched this movie so many times i love it !!! i just wish thomas held himself back a little and the rest listened a little better.
" Remember. Survive. Run.
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,7,"The Maze Runner, a film set in dystopian society where a disease (the flare) has broken out killing the majority of the human race. Until a group of people by the name of W.I.C.K.D rose up to find the cure, experimenting on young adults by setting up a small dome for them that consists of a maze they must go through to find their way out. The movie is a great appeal to teens and young adults and is great to watch with friends. The movie is great and keeps you in suspense and thrills. The Maze Runner has great acting from rising actors such as Dylan O' Brien and Thomas Brodie-Sangster. This movie is highly recommended and will be loved by those who are fans of The Hunger Games and Divergent.""Just follow me and run like your life depends on it. Because it does.""

" amazing
",2018-04-12 00:00:00,10,"Once you have started watching it, there is literally no escape."
" ""If you ain't scared ......... you ain't human""
",2018-04-09 00:00:00,9,"The ""Maze runner"" is a 2014 American science fiction and action film directed by Wes Ball. This film based on James Dashners novel.
The plot is incredibly interesting. The film is about a group of teenagers that got stuck in a maze full of different creatures and with the walls that were opening in the morning and closing in the evening. And young people needed to fing the way to exit that dangerous trap. The main idea is never give up and stop trying, in the end you will achive your aim. The actors was good and their characters too. I also think that make-up artists made a good job, bc actors were looking exactly how they needed to look. What's more, special effects and music are not bad at all. Another advantages are little details, they are properly made. So I can absolutely recommend you to watch ""Maze runner"", hope you will enjoy it."
" Wicked is good
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,6,"A boy named Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) finds himself in an all boy Lord of the Flies type of camp. They are surrounded by a huge wall that opens into a maze. Two runners, run the maze by day and must leave by night or else the ""Grievers"", a giant spider like creature will hunt them. Thomas is not satisfied with the status quo and makes waves. Eventually a girl (Kaya Scodelario) shows up.If you are a teen or tween and like all those kids save the world offerings, this one falls in line. The film is done well enough to hold your interest as the Maze creates a mystery for our human lab rats. The ending tells you why it was done, which still didn't make any sense...and why all guys, or why only one girl? It leads to a sequel. The acting was bland. The dialogue needed zip and Gally (Will Poulter) was a boring antagonist. Good enough for the kids who won't know the difference.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
" A miserable marketing mess.
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,2,"This thing is just a few hours of filler designed to get you to watch the next movie. This is not worth watching, discussing, or paying money for. The acting and ""plot"" and visuals are all bad. I don't understand why this is popular. Well, I do. The books were popular and kids are stupid."
" The Maze Runner is a confident start to another YA franchise.
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,7,"You might be getting sick to death with these YA universes, but guess what? You just got another one. Fortunately though, this is more ""The Hunger Games"" than ""Divergent"" in terms of quality. Don't get me wrong, there is a maze...and there is lots of running...a film that I still think, to this day, Tom Cruise would be more than suitable for. Yet, the central mystery and intrigue is what brings you into the story. Mysteriously trapped in what looks like an endless maze, Thomas must figure out why he has been brought to the maze where his survival skills are put to the test. Aside from the sci-fi traits, this strongly reminded me of William Golding's classic novel ""Lord of the Flies"". In fact, the atmosphere and interactions within 'The Glade' are the most compelling scenes. A struggle for power and authority, the creation of a civilised environment by employing rules that the 'Gladers' abide to and dictating the roles of each individual from agriculture to the more dangerous job of being a ""Runner"". The way the narrative establishes the characters and their roles may be slightly uninspired but for what it's worth, it works. Dylan O'Brien, in a more physical role, controls the film and is surprisingly engaging (considering his lack of previous lead roles). But it's Will Poulter who yet again shines. His lust for power consumes him and conveys him as the antagonist, however there is more to his character that evokes a sense of sympathy. Confident and commanding. Thomas Brodie-Sangster was also good, but Kaya Scodelario...I still find her wooden and monotonous. She really didn't do much here. The plot is fuelled by conveniences, where one convenient plot device leads to another convenient answer and the mystery continues like that. For its target audience, it's functional. I was onboard and intrigued, so I can't say I was ever bored. I did find it was too focused on building a sequel. This becomes apparent during the rushed expositional conclusion. A fun film that caught me off guard."
" Enjoyable but not brilliant
",2018-02-08 00:00:00,7,"The Maze Runner story isn't one of the brilliants I have seen, it is interesting enough to satisfy my interest. Opening scene is intriguing and wakes your interest to wait to see what to come. Story itself is many times seen in various movies, but citation to such movies as Cube and TV- Biggest problem is the movie casting. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) is interesting character enough, but Will Boultier as villain of story is too lame personality. And somehow I don't understand the meaning of Teresa's (Kaya Scolecario) character who seem to pointless for the whole story. Maybe her role for the story grows and clears at the forthcoming movies. Sequel is coming next fall. After all great scenery combined with intensive storytelling is fresh enough to bring this movie a little bit more interesting, than most of those Hollywood's post-apocalyptic serial productions these days."
" We are in the Dark
",2018-02-01 00:00:00,7,"This film was very Hunger Games-like, but definitely unique in its plot. The premise was interesting and kept my attention. I wasn't able to guess what was going to happen. I found myself questioning the entire time. There were a lot of novel ideas and new situations that keep the plot moving along. The most interesting feature of the movie was the dark cinematography, especially on the faces of the characters. I think it adds to the darkness of the situation and their loss of hope. It also speaks to the fact that all the characters are essentially ""in the dark"" about what is going on. At times the darkness was actually a strain on the eyes while watching and trying to figure out what is going on. In a way it puts the viewer a little more in the story because it is an obstacle to overcome like the many faced by the characters. Personally, I do not enjoy this feature, but I get its purpose.

" A Bad Attempt At A Great Book
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,4,"For a long time I heard ""The Maze Runner"" doesn't do the book justice. So, I decided to pick up the book, give it a read, and then watch the movie afterwards. The rumors are true. The movie comes so short of the book that I am surprised James Dashner hasn't ripped his eyes out. I understand the difficulties in taking a best-selling novel and turning it into a great flick. But c'mon with this load of crap. The key differences between the book and movie really take away from the story. In my opinion they ruin the story."
" Fun and entertaining movie to watch.
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,7,"I am not a person that likes to give negative reviews and have negative perspective on things, especially when movies are the subject. There for, I like this movie pretty much. Yes, if you read the goofs you will notice that there are a lot of mistakes and things that could have been done to escape the Maze, but they are not done, but still, it is a quality movie with a lot of good moments and tension building in the very best way possible. The acting is top class, all the kids show their talents in acting and that is one of the things I respect the most. 7-8/10 for me."
" Rating: B-
",2018-01-25 00:00:00,6,"Wes Ball directs the movie-adaptation of the famous novel written by James Dashner, The Maze Runner. Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) wakes up to find out he is stuck inside a huge maze with other young males, who have built a community on a ""field"" surrounded by massive walls in the center of the said maze.With his memory erased, he has to figure out who he really is, what a mysterious organization named W.C.K.D. has to do what all of that and, of course, a way to escape.This film is full of surprises, some are great, some are horrible. The cast is the first good surprise with some amazing performances from pretty much everyone. Dylan O'Brien leads this movie surprisingly well, I did not expect such a high-level display from him since I was also not expecting such a fantastic start to the film. I just thought it was another book-to-movie adaptation to grab some undeserved money.O'Brien really embodies his character and makes his major share of the screentime worthwhile with some emotional scenes adding substance to the action sequences. Thomas is the type of character that instantly connects with the viewers because he is also in the dark regarding his situation and what the future holds for him and the other guys.Will Poulter (Gally) also achieves an outstanding performance by interpreting a more aggressive character who actually has pretty good reasons to act like he does. Kaya Scodelario is quite good as Teresa, but her character serves more as a plot device to develop Thomas and to advance the story than a real girl who ends up in the maze. Thomas Sangster (Newt), Aml Ameen (Alby) and Black Cooper (Chuck) also deliver some great performances, being Cooper the standout of the three.The Maze Runner is very well-directed by Wes Ball. The action scenes through the maze are suspenseful and tense, even though the scorpion-like creatures are too CGI on some occasions. The editing is clean and the isolated setting provides a claustrophobic vibe that elevates the overall beautiful cinematography. It certainly is a good-looking film, with some well-balanced tone and pacing, despite some unnecessary scenes.This movie offers an unconventional journey: for the first hour and a half, I was genuinely stunned with how captivated I was with the intriguing story. The film's premise is massively engaging due to the mystery in regards to the existence of the maze and to why are the kids there. The exposition scenes throughout the first two acts are incredibly well-executed and besides some nonsense lines here and there from any character, I thought this movie was going to be truly astonishing, but then the third act arrived.The ending completely shatters all of the film's logic. I mean, it is got to be one of the senseless endings to a movie I've seen in a long, long time. Being this the first installment of a trilogy, I knew I was not going to have all of the answers and that the screenplay was not going to have a definite end. However, I did not expect that a horrible exposition scene would finish the film by creating several plot holes that I do not think the next movies are going to address.The screenplay starts as a truly interesting and mysterious story and ends with Patricia Clarkson (Ava Paige) destroying any logic the film possessed. I am so disappointed that I am still trying to decide whether I give this movie a positive review or not. Honestly, even knowing a big part of the movie just does not fit correctly with its ending (which, by the way, is very predictable), I was entertained throughout almost all of the runtime and I don't think such a talented cast deserves to go down with the story.All in all, The Maze Runner self-destructs with the only horrible exposition scene of the whole film by throwing away all of its screenplay's logic. Some characters' script contains nonsense lines, but overall they are all well-developed through really well-directed dialogue scenes. Wes Ball uses the beautiful cinematography to elevate the claustrophobic setting and also achieves some cool chasing sequences with some sharp editing. The first two acts are worth watching and the movie's premise is super intriguing, but the last act, unfortunately, brings the whole thing down.MSB Reviews - If you enjoy my spoiler-free reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" Decent movie, may be confusing
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,7,"This film adaptation follows the novel of the same name. There are some deviations that, in my opinion, were unnecessary and raised unanswered questions (especially the Griever Hole scene). The lighting was a bit dark at times, and the plot as well as characters could be confusing even if you read the book. Still, those aside, the movie is alright. The visuals of the Glade and the maze are fantastic, and the acting is decent too. Just try to suspend your disbelief until the film's over."
" Good Scares, Suspense and Performances
",2018-01-11 00:00:00,7,"I like this movie not for its story but for the brilliant suspense, scare thrills, sound effects and the performances. The horror doesn't go overboard either and takes its time to grow on you and gets relentless only towards the final scenes deep inside the maze. The cast is good too especially few of the boys from the maze like Dylan O'Brien, Aml Ameen, Ki Hong Lee, Blake Cooper, Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Will Poulter(very good as Gally the bully :)). Even the end was quite unpredictable. What I don't really get is the story. The people who built the maze intended something(revealed in the end) from it which didn't convince me well - all that complication just to find out a.......(spoilers) - which is why I'm not keen to watch out for any sequel that follow as hinted by a major character in the climax. Yet don't let a bunch of very young actors & a maze make you underestimate this movie. It engages you all the way and is watchable with family too."

",2017-12-04 00:00:00,10,"The Maze Runner and the Scorch Trails were both Jammed packed with action and adventure. I highly recommend The Maze Runner to everyone looking for a action Movie. The Death Cure the third movie comes out January, 26th, 2018. This movie is going to be over the top, can't wait to watch it."
" Some kids get trapped in a maze and they have to find a way out.
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,1,"I heard that this movie was bad from my friends who had watched it. I just finished the book and wanted to watch the movie anyway. I know that the movie was going to be different than the book but Gally was completely different in the movie than the book. The directors butchered any depth in his character and made him a stereotypical ""can't handle change"" sort of antagonist. Important scenes and details were either completely changed or not even there in the first place. Where was the Homestead? How come Thomas and Theresa can't communicate telepathically? The entire ending was completely different and it sucked. I didn't like the book that much either but I expected more from a movie that received an award for Best Hero."
" Read
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,5,"A movie based off a book is always a bit worse than the book IMO. But the maze runner movie was absolutely completely terribly worse than the book. Almost completely different plot, no emotion at all compared to the movie, and just plain bad. It'd be a badass movie for those who haven't read the book. But if you have and are expecting it just to be a live action version of the book, the movie isn't near worth the watch."
" Nothing like the book.
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,2,"I always read the book first and in this case that's all you should do. This movie is so unlike the book they might as well have not written "" Based off the best selling novel."" Because it isn't. The only way its similar is that it has the names of some of the things in the book. It leaves out HUGE important bits of information like Thomas and Tersa's telepathic ability. I know this was probably just in my mind but I think the actors who played the roles of the characters look nothing like how I not only imagined but also was led up to believe by the author. The author described them very differently then the actors looked. And they changed so much too! Like how Ben is stung after Thomas arrives. Or how the cliff doesn't exist in the movie. In the book there was a invisible hole off the side of the cliff called ""The griever hole"" in the movie it was just part of the maze they stumbled on. Also there is nothing about the beetle blades And WICKED. I could go on and on forever but one last thing. The ending. It was COMPLETELY different from the book! They didn't have to do anything involving the code WORDS, Everyone at WICKED is dead, Chuck is shoot with a gun instead of being stabbed with a knife, and Gally ends up with a steak in his chest. I don't understand how this movie could be so different. Like I said I could go on and on forever but just do this for me. ONLY READ THE BOOK!"
" Disappointing mystery
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,8,"A boy wakes up in a cage being lifted up in a very odd place. As he doesn't remember anything, he finds out he's trapped with a couple of other guys which struggle to survive in a harsh environment, being surrounded by an enormous maze which is as lethal as it is big. Unlike the others, he's not willing to accommodate in that place, so he starts venturing in the maze, trying to figure out why they were sent there and search for a way out.It seemed like a very interesting idea even from the trailer, but, as I was expecting, it proved to be quite a bad movie. That surreal place is being ""populated"" by some boys who are as intelligent as the concrete walls surrounding them. Instead of trying to find a way out, something any normal human would do, they waste their time mocking each other, fighting, or even bossing around. They are simply happy with their current life and are not willing to do anything to change it. The main character isn't much better either, many of his decisions being arguable, to say the least.I gave it this rating for two main reasons. It has an interesting ""arena"", where the action takes place and, although it's mostly predictable, it brings a surprising and plausible conclusion, while leaving room for a sequel."
" If you're looking for this movie to be like the book you will be utterly disappointed.
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,4,"A movie is never as good as a book--that's a given. A movie can't develop characters like a book, and it doesn't dive deep into what the characters are thinking and feeling. Time also inhibits the amount of details that can be included. Still some movies manage to capture books on film very well. The entire Hunger Games series (2012-15) has been an excellent telling of the book series. A movie like ""The Shining"" (1980) has an alternate ending from Stephen King's book, but capture the essence of the novel. ""Angels & Demons"" (2009) left out a lot of details from Dan Brown's novel, but kept the general plot line. This movie fails on all accounts. After reading the book I was looking forward to seeing this movie. There were a lot of parts I was curious to see depicted on screen. So many details were changed, and the plot line was completely altered. I was disappointed on all accounts. In both we have a world where adolescent boys are taken, wiped of all of their previous memories. They live in a walled region known as The Glade, outside of which lies a mysterious moving maze. At night, the doors that lead to the maze shut. In the book, these doors are massive wall which shut defying all laws of physics. In the movie they show a perfectly plausible gear system only made slightly implausible by the character saying ""How is that even possible?"" In the book it never rains--in the movie it rains. The meaning of the maze is completely different in the two. The grievers, the creatures in the maze, are an utter disappointment. It's hard for me to tell if I would've enjoyed this movie more if I hadn't read the book more. The amount of death and violence is high for a very young audience, but the plot has been watered down so much it's hard to imagine it's intended for a more sophisticated viewer. If you're interested in The Maze Runner, watch the movie first and then read the book, or skip the movie entirely. Doing it in the order I did will prove utterly disappointing."
" Fine movie, would watch again

I'd probably go watch it again though. 10/10 I would maybe, probably go watch it again so long as it's free. The movie wasn't good or bad it was just fine.>Spelunking anime"
" Too generic
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,4,"Another day, another Hollywood blockbuster based on a young adult novel and featuring a teenage cast involved in a huge game while trying to stay alive. Yep, it's another film that's completely derivative of THE HUNGER GAMES and DIVERGENT, with little to make it stand out. This time around, a group of kids are randomly trapped inside a giant, shifting maze and must figure out a way to escape.Inevitably this is a film full of bland, CGI action scenes that always turn me off. There's just nothing exciting watching a couple of characters running from a CGI effect. The monsters in the maze are quite boring, a bit like the bugs in STARSHIP TOOPERS but partly mechanical. This film's saving grace is the quality of the acting, which is better than expected; the lead is quite likable and the supporting players have distinct characters which makes a change from the usual nonsense. I'll be catching the sequel at some point, but I don't expect much from it on the strength of this."
" Boring, predictable, formulaic, juvenile nonsense
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,1,"This will probably be the shortest review I shall ever write... I can't think what made me watch this last night, but I know if I don't review it right now, it will fade completely from my memory (not a bad thing), as it has, quite simply, not a single thing to recommend it (it's not even so bad it's good)... I only hope I remember not to watch the next instalment (yes, as has been mentioned by other reviewers, this is the first in a trilogy-Hollywood's latest ploy in parting you from as much money as possible-subdividing stories that have simple plots that could be dealt with quickly and efficiently, into several movies that contain mainly filler, irrelevant subplots, and, especially in this case, pages of utterly inane and pointless dialogue)...This is obviously taking advantage of the success of the 'Mockingjay' series, but has none of the quality of cast, spectacle, decent effects, nor dark, serious back-plot of those films... Bad as they were, they were all infinitely better than this...Every actor was awful (where did they find them), even the usually reliable Patricia Clarkson, who makes a brief appearance at the end, and whom I re-saw recently in 'Vicky Cristina Barcelona'-she should be ashamed of herself for 'phoning in her performance, but it at least illustrates the point that the blame for this travesty should lie squarely on the shoulders of the director, Wes Ball. Most of his work has been in TV, and I suggest he returns there, where he can do less damage... The SFX were so-so, some of them shown on such a dark screen it was difficult to make anything out... In an age of CGI, it's hard to make a mess of this aspect of film-making, and yet this crew succeeded...But the 'plot', that's my main gripe-it just made no sense whatsoever-riddles with holes and illogicities-too many to list here-a group of boys, in an isolated community, would not simply turn to farming the land and following rules set down arbitrarily by one of their number-they would constantly squabble, argue and fight for supremacy and their own point of view-form gangs and alliances, question anybody's right to command, lie, steal and cheat-remember 'Lord of the Flies', or the feral tribe of children in 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome'?.. Or even, dare I mention it the Hunger Games themselves?.. They smacked of the truth-this is just a modern-day piece of PC propaganda (let's get along and love each other-only not in the physical sense, because...)-I know it was written for the teenage/young adult market, but it's just so out of kilter, it felt awkward-or did for some of the time, because I fell asleep for 20 mins., woke up, and realized I hadn't missed a single thing... Says it all.really...So, rather than watch this steaming pile of ordure, or either of its sequels, turn off the TV and watch some paint drying instead-you'll find it more entertaining and less frustrating, and you can thank me later...Wasn't so short after all..."
" Original and pleasurable, but could be better
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,7,"I liked it, but it could have been so much better than what it actually is. Through the whole movie you don't understand why they are there and the final explanation is just worse than anything you came up with during the movie.Then there are a lot of noticeable plot holes and that's just bad."
" A Maze of Ideas: The Ultimate Pan-Optic Mystery
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,10,"Aside from its kinetic action and proto-juvenile cinematic tropes, The Maze Runner is also unique in that it (however improbably) strikingly offers a sustained philosophical and theological methodology that speaks to past and present thought orders and cultural configurations. In terms of precise ontic collectives that the alphic film explores, it arguably principally factors upon the central heliocentric primal-narrative that underscores the classic 'So-Called Proper Name' metaphysical principle, a proposal that has haunted European epistemological revelation for at least five centuries, and which led to the valiant (but doomed) post-Enlightenment quest for the ur-standard in pseudo-ludology. Moreover, in the middle section, the film progresses to cryptically evoke the imaginary mediation of the De Interpretation-like inescapable traction that Zoran Toltec argued bedevilled ancient Greek thought, and so it brings to light the near-forgotten Scythian teleological dilemma in synthesis with the broken thread of the modern 'Beauborg Maxim.' All of this places the filmic chronicle, in its quasi-zenith, within the confines of a delirious (yet grounded) apotheosis of illusion, and (somewhat audaciously, it must be said) incontrovertibly presents a pan-optic mandala scenario to confront both the characters and the cinematic audience directly and without compromise. Consequently, in the final sequences of the first chapter, this is ultimately the character of Thomas's non-physical/embodied Möbius status: an immanent and immutable rhizoid stasis within a revitalised and hyper-heterogeneous simulacrum of what Viktor Imzadi famously dubbed the 'Labyrinth of the Eternal Thought Cavern.' Thus, it will be interesting to see where the series takes these ideas, but from the philosophical foundation that is central to the first instalment, it seems evident to me that the story will inevitably journey into the very heart of Kazimir Yadlo's conception of the primordial Origami Cosmos thesis."
" trapped
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,7,"More than the trite Divergent or po-faced Hunger Games franchises, The Maze Runner strikes the right note of adventure and earnestness for a teen fantasy-adventure movie. A group of teenagers find themselves deposited one by one in a mysterious glade enclosed by a huge maze. In the three years that they have been there, the have learned that escape is impossible, and entering the maze at night means certain death. Then Thomas arrives, and challenges all their carefully constructed rules, some of which have taken on sacred value for some members. Very few iterations of Lord of the Flies get it right, but the young actors in Maze Runner are plausible, and the running, jumping and rolling between closing walls and crashing edifices is tense and thrilling. There is good balance between action scenes and character-conflict scenes, with judicious dashes of comedy. Sure there are some plot holes, but nothing that has you throwing popcorn at the screen. It even gets away with a moment that is usually unforgivable, an ending that shamelessly sets up the sequel. Good fun for teenagers of all ages."
" some one traps a couple kids in an unknown area and they have to find an escape route
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,10,This movie is a great film if you are looking for action and drama. This movie is a 10/10 because it has great actors and is very dramatic. It kind of reminds me of the fifth wave in a way because the aliens capture humans and keep them in a secured place for whatever reason. This movie portrays good quantities but also has a few areas to improve on.
" Maze Runner: The Search for Women
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,5,"An extended pack of newly pubescent boys wanders parent-less in a lush ""Glade"" (did Albert originally pen that name? It seems a little college freshman 101 English for a kid) and yet they display no obsession with the lack of women? Did the wiping of their memories also give them an interest in gardening to the extent that they are reluctant to try to solve the ridiculous cement maze that surrounds them? In real life, the lack of female companionship would have meant more boys would be volunteering as maze runners than hanging around building lean-to's as occurs in the film. Teresa's arrival - the first woman many had seen in 3 years - might have started an out and out civil war. Putting the sexual (or lack thereof) politics aside, the movie presents a fairly book-y device of a government in crisis using scarce resources to build a massive climate-controlled, cyborg filled intelligence test which takes 3 years to produce results. Couldn't they just have administered the Wechsler and saved themselves 2 years, 11 months, 3 weeks, 6 days and 23 hours and a billion dollars? Applying a fair amount of disbelief the story itself is a relatively straightforward one of group problem solving under adverse conditions. The twists at the end are dopey but do serve to set up a half billion dollar sequel. The characters and their characterization leave the audience whispering: ""who's he again?"" Only Will Poulter's ""Gally"" distinguishes himself as the voice of conservatism against the more charismatic, liberal Gladers. His views are compelling and one assumes had the grievers not mounted a mass attack, he probably would still be the Glades's democratically elected leader. How he shows up at the end of the film makes no sense within the story's own logic - remember the giant metal blades shut beyond the group? In short, a not un-entertaining also-ran among the ""Hunger Games"", ""Divergent"", dystopian future subgenre."
" Opinion of an-original-story-of ""The Maze Runner""-lover
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,2,"I am truly disappointed.Beside the book, the movie is just a continuous, fast-forward dynamic escape from the maze. The story between Thomas and Teresa (especially the telepathic conversations), the friendship between Thomas and Chuck and the conflict between Thomas and Gally are not exploited even at minimum. In other words, the movie seems like it doesn't give you time to fall in love or to truly hate some characters or couples. Without those, you can't visualize the perspective of the author about the life in the maze. Even the exploring was made fast- forward. In the book you get a bigger picture of what the maze was, you travel with Thomas, you understand the maze..Without those, the movie is just a typical post-apocalyptic experiment made on a selected group of people.I am kind of scared of what the next movie brings; maybe it will destroy even more the original story..."
" Seriously?????
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,1,"Mr Hall, what were you thinking? So, let me get this straight. After a terrible holocaust in which a great number of the world's population perished, some people decided to go to great lengths to create and maintain an secretive, complex, difficult, costly, and GIGANTIC concrete maze with enormous moving walls and populated with gigantic malevolent monsters in order to . . . sorry. In order to test the brains of 2 dozen boys? Seriously? You couldn't think of an easier way to do it? Why not just test them in a lab? And why oh why, and this was never explained at any point . . . why create and then insert a bunch of hostile monsters to kill said boys? What would happen if these monsters killed ALL the boys? Pointless. Illogical. Self-defeating. Paper-thin. A. Complete. Waste. Of. Time.Avoid at all costs."
" Solid dystopian YA story which reminded me of 'Lord of the Flies' crossed with 'Cube'
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"As this film opens our protagonist wakes in a large lift that takes him to a green area surrounded by high walls. He has no memory of what happened before, initially he doesn't even know his name although he later recalls that it is Thomas. There are other people there already; all teenage boys and none have any memory of what happened before they got there or knowledge of why they have been put there. Thomas is told that once a month a new person arrives along with vital supplies. He also learns that the area they live in is known as The Glade and the wall contain a giant maze; giant doors into the maze are open during the day and closed at night runners go into the maze during the day hoping to find a way out and if any are trapped in the maze when the doors close they will never be seen again. Apparently creatures known as Grievers come out at night although nobody has seen one and lived to tell the tale. That is until Thomas enters the maze to help two other boys and is caught inside. Not only do they manage to survive the night Thomas actually manages to kill a Griever. Things soon start to change; Thomas and another boy discover that the Grievers are man-made, they think they have found a way out and then the elevator delivers a new person; the first girl to be sent to the glade. Some people think that Thomas will be the one to get them out of the maze but one boy, Gally, is convinced that he has brought danger to them and insists that he is punished for what he has done. Sides are taken and a group make a bid for freedom.When I started watching this I wasn't expecting too much perhaps because of that I found myself pleasantly surprised. The idea of having a group of boys trapped in an enclosed location immediately made me think of 'Lord of the Flies' although the society depicted here isn't quite so fragile even if Gally's actions appear to push it that way. The fact that the maze changed each night and contained dangers reminded me of the Sci-fi film 'Cube'; although with this films young adult demographic it is far less violent. That doesn't mean there is no sense of real danger; it gets pretty intense at times and has moments when it is genuinely scary. A fair number of characters die including some one would expect to survive. The film has a good look with the maze having a real feel to it. The cast, which featured nobody I recognised in major roles, did a solid job making the viewer believe in the characters and their situation. There are some weaknesses, mostly when we are finally told why the boys were selected and why the maze was created in the first place, also the ending felt entirely like a set up for the next film in the series which of course it was. Overall though I found this to be a solid story and will keep an eye open for the sequel."
