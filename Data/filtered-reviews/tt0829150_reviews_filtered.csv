" Totally Nonsense
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,1,It's a disgraceful movie. The movie made just to make the Turks look bad. This is a example of bad faith against Turks.
" History is written by the victors
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,7,"I don't study history. I don't have a political or religious agenda. I watch a lot of movies and TV. I get bored with unimaginative re-tellings of stories I have already heard with increasing gore, brutality and shock and very little reason to make a new movie except that the new one is the grossest ever.
Luckily, this movie was refreshing for me. A different take on a tale none of us were alive to witness and testify to the veracity of the details. Told from Dracula's (and sometimes his son's) point of view, placing him as the sometimes misunderstood hero fighting for the freedom of his people from what he saw as a tyrannical rule.
No one wants the people they love to be seen as the monster in their own story, so give this fictitional-nonhistorical telling of vlad's actions and motives in his imaginary son's own imaginary words.Action, good acting, a different telling of a familiar story, and for the first time his wife wasn't insane and driven to self harm. I found this movie to be an interesting change of perspective in a completely fictional story."
" wrong history
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,1,"You better read the true history. This is such a lie. He became king thanks to Mehmet. Mehmet did not take kids. He only took kids Who have no family. He gave them home, food, clothes. Vlad was one of them. He became friend of Mehmet. Mehmet made him king about five years in Eflak. He didnot pay any money to Mehmet. And wanted Turks soldiers for help him. Mehmet sent him soldiers and Vlad killed them all. After that Mehmet got angered and his soldier killed Vlad. His head in Istanbul! That is the real history."
" Unreal history
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,1,Totally waste of time. They messed up all time history. Please do research before filming
" A Good Warrior Movie
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,8,"Maybe small in EXACT details of D's true origin, but a GREAT warrior movie! This movie is the cool version of D's origin, really good entertainment üëçüèºüëçüèº"
" Phenomenal Story About One's Own Sacrifices For Others
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,9,"Those who feel somehow Dracula is gospel, need one remind you, it's just a story; the first, this one, True Blood, Underworld, Blade... They all take some liberty at telling a story from different perspectives. Whether you require the boring repetitiveness of the same, same story, countlessly told over and over again, that's your prerogative. But for those of us who enjoy a good story and are not bound by doctrine, we can appreciate the creation of a different vantage this film presents. It is a film which speaks of the honor of an individual who scarifies his very own life for the sake of others; about honor and values. Personally, I found the script, production, direction and cast superbly executed, coupled with phenomenal special effects. I have enjoyed it immensely, multiple times, since its release."
" Don't listen to the hitoricisians wannabes, it's a great movie.
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,10,"Seriously guys, calm down, it's just a movie, nobody cares about all your history facts.
It's a really entertaining movie, definitely recommend."
" Awesome
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,10,"Very good and emosional movie, although many of my friends give bad scores because this movie describes the terrible savage of turks ottoman"
" Unexpected entertainment!
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,7,"Edit: This movie is NOT a 9 or 10, but it is most certainly NOT a 4 or below, as many have implied.I'll keep this brief. I saw the title and had exactly no expectations, not seen a trailer or read anymore than the film description on Netflix.Stunning CGI, filmography is superb with very interesting fight scenes and display of vampire power.
Acting was surprisingly good, and an absolute joy to see Charles Dance, which was unexpected. Luke Evans portrayed the role of Dracula very well.
Script was decent as well as the over arching story. The end felt a bit rushed - it could have done with an extra 15 minutes to set up the final fight.It's a different take to Dracula, which I don't mind at all. Will it win any awards? Perhaps not, but overall it was a good bit of entertainment, and I would recommend it to anyone who has a couple hours to spare.Well deserved 7/10!edit: This movie is NOT a 9 or 10, but it is most certainly NOT a 4 or below."
" The Game Is On
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,6,Let's get kickin' some alien aaaaaasssss- looks like we'll be in the future and we'll be kickin some alien ass
" Must Watch
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,10,"I've watched this many times over the years, never been disappointed and would watch it again and again. It's the proper take on the Dracula story, from the battlefields!
Isn't that where Dracula originates from?! A king who killed so many...
I'd love to see a second film especially with Luke Evans, he did so well as Dracula. Although I would of kept him back in the old era ruling his kingdom beside his son. With more money pumped into it so we see better graphics and gore on the battle fields.
This film has so much potential to do more, please make it happen üôè"
" a pretty great movie
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,10,"I liked it , the plot was amazing and effects were great"
" Lack of logic about good bad and fair
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,1,"Fiction must not have a proper logic in some ways. But this movie has a base about the story untold about Dracula. So at the end a ""decent"" prince killed thousands of men and women both his enemies and his own folk. But the streamline is ""He is not a villain he is a good christian, prince and father."" Villain is Sultan Mehmet who is trying to stop a monster at the end. CGI and nothing else."
" A fun popcorn flick
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,7,"I watched this on Netflix recently and had a good ol time, this isn't perfect by any means but read on to find out why.The positives:
great acting, cast and characters.the scariest most powerful vampires I have ever seenthe story is wholesome and fun to watchthe cgi is decent and has really cool scenes at timessome scenes were spine tingling and the end was really good which would have lead to a awesome sequel.Now the negatives:
-the villain was a bit lackluster and the haircut didnt fit in the time period at all.
I don't really know why he doesn't pay his kid much attention near the endthe story is good but lacks Emersion and depth. There isn't much suspense.Overall I did really enjoy this film even though it isn't perfect and has its flaws it is still a cool and enjoyable film that I would highly reccomend. 6.7/10 for me."
" Great underrated movie
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,8,"Having scarcity of movies at the beginning of 2021, I found myself revisiting some movies in Netflix from the past that I thought were good. That's how I rewatched with this movie today.
I can say that after more than 6 years from its release this movie it's still rock solid.
--- THE FOLLOWING IS SPOILER FREE UNTIL THE LAST FEW PARAGRAPHS, I WILL WARN YOU WHEN I START THE SPOILERSThere is a bunch of nysayers and fanatics from Stocker's novel that keeps ranting about this film, however they are just closed minded and missing the point of movies and the beauty of reimagining a story.Dracula Untold, definitely goes away from the traditional Stocker folklore, and provides a fresh start with the origin of the fearless Vlad Tepes Dracul which is based on the real historic figure Vlad III or Vlad Tepes the III, Vlad the Impaler. Here is where most people start getting confused. This is not the novel, this is a reimagination of Vlad Tepes III and crossover the myth of vampires from Romania. Of course there are connections / inspirations that Stocker draw from Romian culture and the use of the house of Dracul may be where the connection stops. The same goes for this movie.
The story of Vlad mixed with the romanian vampires is perfect, gives a rich story that could be entertaining, which for most accounts in all reviewers this makes a great deal of entertaining, most criticism goes in rants like ""this is not Dracula"", ""this is not accurate"", ""this is not the story"", which is plainly dumb in my opinion.
Especially considering that 6 years before this movie came out people were applauding a movie where vampires shines like fairies (not pun intended, it's actually more close to a fairy creature).I like this is more in line like other reimagined views of Dracula like the videogame saga that more recently got a great animated series ""Castlevania"" or even Blade as he goes into that alternative mythology as well. Although I prefer Castlevania point of view for this analogy as resembles more what Dracula Untold stands for.This story and film has a lot of potential, and could have made a great saga that reshape the way we see this character to something less horror like. This brings action sequences closes to what the Underworld saga does for the dark world mythology, which is refleshing to see in this character that has been poorly treated outside the traditional Stocker inspired movies.To not extend more in this review I would say this is a great movie, a great reimagination of the Vlad Tepes mythology (which is not the same as Bram's one) and I see there is a missed potential here.-- SPOILERS FROM HERE ON -- YOU'VE BEEN WARNEDThe only aspects to be fair in my review that I don't like, are probably the duration of the movie, another 30 or 40 min would have been great to expand character development and have a more visceral take on the action scenes and even in the resolution after the death of the Sultan, the fight (or lack of) between Vlad and his recently converted friends and citizens could have had more drama, with an escape scene showing the monk and the boy and a final action take between Vlad and the vampires until he finally makes the last sacrifice by opening the sky.All an all I think even if that would have been ideal is very well told as a story and delivers in a great matter.
The only thing that I really wish they have not messed up is the final scene where they jump to the future / present day and he finds the reincarnation of Mirena, I just really wish they would not have used ""Mina"" as her name because that draws back attention to those arguments about ""this is not the story"". I wish they have actually made the effort to go away and maybe make an omage like showing Vlad watching one of the Bram stocker Dracula movies.Other than that this is to me is a great movie, something I would really love to see a sequel if some studio (or Netflix / Amazon.. wink wink) is courageous enough to take (against the nysayers).Please watch it!"
" amazing movie
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,10,"Please make a sequel, I love this movie, the story is well written, the actors and actresses well chosen and the production it's also great, this movie deserves many more reviews"
" Loved it!
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,10,"I feel sometimes when you go into a movie having certain expectations or comparing to previous movies you end up disappointed.
Watching this movie I was pleasantly surprised and loved the new take on Dracula. It was fresh, different and I was wanting more with the way it ended. I would have loved to see where this would have taken us. The acting was fantastic, the story was great. My only critique is that it could have been a bit longer. Hopefully we will get to see where this goes one day."
" Top new vampire story yet!! Luke Evan's was PHENOMENAL as dracula!!BRAVO!!!
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,10,"Ignore the morons that dont get that vampires aren't real!! And its dracula you can change the story it's just a name, I've seen other versions and appreciate those as well but this is my favorite NEW version!! Luke Evan's absolutely knocked this out of the park, his performance was FLAWLESS!! I wish it had a sequel it's one of the few that not only deserves 1 but would be a great candidate for 1. PLEASE powers that be make a sequel, trust me ...make it and they will come!!, if you haven't seen this phenomenal horror/thriller remember it's a new version but absolutely watch it its amazing!!"
" Is a clever side story except for the stupid ending.
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,7,The idea is cool. Dracula v Turkish army trying to invade Transylvania and the desperate help he asks to an ancient vampire in a cave turns Vlad the Impaler in a savage blood monster. That's good. The movie has pretty decent FX. . . BUT THE ENDING IS THE WORST OF ALL. I think director's girlfriend wrote it. WHAT A CORNY-STUPID finale. The movie should end when the gypsy resurrects Dracula and he open his eyes. Period.
" Surprised
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,8,"I'll really got surprised how bad I'll thought it was going to be.Not really an masterpiece but it did deserve an sequel if you ask me.
I'll seen far worse with both one and two sequels. Looking at you twilight."
" Enjoyable! Sexy & Fun
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,10,Luke Evans does a great job with a timeless story. Its not perfect but hell it's a fun ride! Entertainment...don't over think it. Despite any shortcomings I really liked this film.
" Worse then old fashioned Cuneyt Arkin or Bollywood Movies
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,1,"If it was turkish Movie, its rating would be less then 3. Just because of being against Ottoman Empire, it is overrated. There is no logical/historical truth inside of the Movie. I think Amerika needs to create their own history. Else we will continue to see Hollywood dreams"
" Nooo
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,1,"Even if the film is fiction, there are things with perception management. In the Ottoman Empire, children were never taken from their families and made ruthless soldiers, even though I knew that it was fiction when I first watched it as a historian."
" Somewhat boring
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,4,"The movie is a muddle of unconvincing night action scenes. It failed to achieve anything basically. Its neither horror,dramatic or historical. Its an okay movie if you're looking for something to pass time with."
" Pretty, fun, stylish, but stupid
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,7,"I don't care about historical incorrectness, it's a good action movie with great visuals, cool action and good acting. What pulls it down is that a lot of the courses of action chosen by the protagonist are... well, dumb. Other times it just makes no sense how things like speed/strenght vary from scene to scene - ex. one moment - can fly like a bullet, next moment, cant' catch a falling object.
Too many slightly cringy moments. But still. Worth watching!"
" Great entertainment
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,8,"If you enjoy vampire movies and fantasy, you will most likely enjoy this one."
" Over here historical drama buffs
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,8,"This is a satisfying distraction for historical drama buffs looking for a tasteful splash of fantasy and horror. Well acted and although I've not seen the end, I somehow believe this would have made a great season series."
" Bad
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,1,Very bad. Absolutely fake facts. This movie isn't historical.
" I loved this Dracula movie
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,10,"I am waiting for the continue... ""Let the games begin."" üôÉ"
" Great film
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Films are about entertainment, this does in buckets. What more is there to say?
Well placed, plenty of action. All good."
" A completely wrong historical fiction!
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,1,"Even Romania's own history is III. Vlad writes bad, so Dracula is a bad character. But the movie was insisted on making the Turks look bad. The Turks should have been the good character of this movie."
" The betrayal of history
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,1,"II.Mehmet(Fatih Sultan Mehmet) had never been a cruel emperor. Vlad never killed any of Ottoman Sultans. He was just a lokal leader, placed by Ottoman Empire and killed by Ottoman soldiers in 1476, because of being one of the most cruel man ever lived in history.
I know this is just a fiction but noone have any rights to use real names. II.Mehmet is one of the wisest and smartest leader ever lived. III.Vlad is one of the most cruel man ever lived.
I suggest you to learn some history, read book!"
" Go watch a doco
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,8,"To all those complaining about inaccurate history - it's a movie! It's allowed to be fictitious. If you want facts go and watch a documentary.It's not a perfect film, but I found it to be entertaining and a good take on the origin of Dracula.Also, for those crying Mehmed died at 50 and wasn't killed by Dracula, please tell me you know Dracula wasn't a real person?"
" Dear scripwriters, just use google. Okey?
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,2,"How is it that Mehmed II, who was born in 1432, ascended the throne in 1442 and went to war? I passed him too, the man conquered Istanbul in 1453, the era opened, the era closed, you killed the great man with a stake in 1442. I'm calling out to the scripwriters from here, it's a legendary event, but it's a shame you never looked at it on google. I have never seen such clumsy mindless scenarios in my life !!!"
" A solid 7.5, imdb rating undeserved
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,8,"Similar to Guy Ritchie's King Arthur, I can't disagree more with the viewer ratings. It's not supposed to be historically accurate, or true to the books - these kind of movies are supposed to be entertaining.
And that it was! I'm glad I gave it a shot, and kind of bummed I missed out on it when it was released back then in the cinemas.The acting was great (thanks to Charles Dance, Luke Evans and Sarah Gadon); the cinematography beautiful, good CGI for the majority; and the story interesting with a slight twist to the Dracula story we know.If you're looking for a popcorn movie that doesn't disappoint, give it a go!"
" You r very funny (!)
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,1,"Don't worry, the Turks will love your regiment when the time comes (!)"
" Bad
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,4,Movie very bad. This Dracula's actor is the worst dracula ever
" The legacy of maturity, protected by Luke Evans
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,9,"The unfortunate situation. Already, the prelude to American destiny paradigm has taken its elegant structure, and yet, one feels it necessary to partake in the survival of the fittest dimension.In the caves of the master vampire (Charles Dance), Vlad (Luke Evans) and his discussion about survival of the fittest is indeed, the story of Americanism's call to heroism of the other, however, such is the library-misdemeanour of Dracula Untold: its fitting tribute to the intellectualism of heroism is anointed its annoyance, by also being a situation of glamour's (leadership's) typical undoing by the antithesis.And alas. The SOTF paradigm extends to the last info. In general, what I'm speaking of is that DU is an excellent portrait of people, but it is ironically a duality system of boredom imitating the excellence.A warrior man, who needs to protect his kingdom. His saving grace is the unknown. Already, one has the duality system in place, with its reaches knowing where to start and where to end. To an adult man, the unknown can be a stupid predicament, and thus, is the point: difference is DU's UD.Truth be told: I was loosely following myself, around most of the previous paragraph, only becoming proper at the very end.In Dracula Untold, the man is the window into the substance. Perhaps that's somewhat how DU becomes UD; it shows substance. From the very beginning, the 'Behind to Wait' posture of Vlad, while in the forest with his unit, to Sarah Gadon's pleas to protect her son from joining the army, to the outrage illustrated by Vlad, when he proclaims ""...because of what I did to save you!"", and then finally, to the end, in which Vlad's army of vampires are the shown substance - the silver horse, DU has its boredom as its property (but then, such was my own ironic luck, of reaching to this juncture in the commentary, despite being an adult man).Laughing at people is substance; what's greater substance, is adult men and women in DU doing their part to uphold the stuff of nightmares"
" ""Dracula Untold"" - excellent.
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,8,"As someone who has probably watched just about any and every
Dracula movie, from Hammers Christopher Lee to today, just put
away your idea of The Count and pivot to this latest iteration.Put yourself in the shoes of an individual (The Prince) who wants
to save his country - and who comes up with a plan to do so.To me, this was a great movie with tons of action - and fans of
Dracula will take to this big screen adaptation; sit back and enjoy."
" A bit sketchy
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,8,But very interesting ending. i wonder when maybe the next movie comes out. it would be a blast. Remembered me of highlander and jumper
" Let the Games Begin
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,7,"Dracula Untold is one of my favorite vampire movies, and I fear it has gone underappreciated, not only does this movie impress me enough to write this review, I feel it deserved more recognition, since it is one of the best retellings of Dracula's origin.Characters:
Vlad is a very well written character, but perhaps not the kind of Dracula you would expect. Despite being raised by the Ottoman empire to be a killing machine and the titled "" Impaler"", he shows a level of humanity you wouldn't expect from such a man. he is shown to be a good husband, father and king, in fact everything he does in the movie is selfless and noble, to the point you don't question that he would sacrifice his soul for his people. But i fear they made this Dracula too likeable, because as he struggles through the movie to remain human, you actually want him to succeed, which adds to the tragedy. Sarah Gordon as Dracula's supportive wife, is absolutely gorgeous and really brings out the best in Vlad, together her and luke evans have some of the best romantic dialogue and are believable as a couple. But the man who steals the show, is Tywin Lannister himself, Charles Dance, who only has a few minutes onscreen, but is completely memorable as the master vampire, he has the best dialogue in the movie and is truly terrifying. While the king of the ottoman empire is a vile villain hes more of an obstacle for Vlad than an actual archenemy, but with more screen time I'm sure he could have been more compelling. In fact i think every character in this movie could have used more screen time since almost every character was interesting from Vlad's royal advisor to the priest, they have the makings of being great character but just lack the correct screen time, especially Charles Dance.Dialogue: The writing for this movie is truly compelling and profound, the very idea of a man giving up his humanity protect what he loves has never been done so good like in this story. Through clever dialogue we understand vlad was a child soldier and refuses to give up his son to that lie, even willing to make a deal with the devil. What's most interesting about that is that vlad is determined for salvation, since he only has to go 3 days without drinking human blood. You see him struggle but persevere, as he discusses with his wife how God can still forgive him, since is his goals are pure, but sadly good intentions sometimes pave the road to hell.The Music: The music in this movie is positively spinetingling, being dark and gothic, classic Dracula. I even play the soundtrack every Halloween, i recommend you listen to ""The Brood"", it will make you afraid.Cinematography: The visuals are gorgeous in this movie, the atmosphere is positively gothic. i will admit the only times when this movie looks weird is when CGI is heavily used such as during the war scenes.Action: Like i just said the weakest part of this movie is the action, while it is most certainly ambitious, the cgi used for the large battles misses the mark. Vlad fighting an army of a 1000 soldiers by himself is badass, its so distorted and clunky you cant really enjoy the fight scenes, which is why I'm sure the creators kept the fights so short and why they added impressive CGI effects to distract you. Anytime Vlad is displaying his powers, the effects are done simply but impressively. The final battle between the ottoman empire and the vampire army is however the best fight in the movie, watching Vlad's former subjects massacre the ottomans is both satisfying and horrifying to watch.Dark Universe: The movie ends on a very compelling cliffhanger, with vlad being in modern day and Charles dance being close by saying ""Let the Games begin"". And to be honest, i still wish a sequel had been made to this. Luke Evans was born to play Dracula, Charles Dance makes such a amazing villain, in fact hes the main reason i want a sequel so badly, just to see more of him as the master vampire. I feel this movie didn't deserve to be shunned as a pathetic popcorn action movie, this movie has atmosphere and charisma. While its tru there are some clunky moments here and there it has nothing to do with the acting or writing. I feel this is the movie that should have started the dark universe, imagine Dracula a the Tony stark/captain America of his monster steam. granted while the dark universe was too pretentious for its own good, I feel they could have built off of this movie and its sequel. Well never know.
I honesty don't consider tis the same traditional Dracula like Bela lagosi or Christopher lee, hes just too noble, but this Dracula will most certainly still compel you to do its bidding....And that is to give this review a like. Happy Halloween Folks!"
" My Favorite Dracula Movie Of All Time!!!
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,10,This movie delivered everything I hoped it would be. This and The Invisible Man 2020 are my two favorite Dark Universe movies in my opinion! I own them both! üòé
" Dracula as family man, no, just no
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,2,"This shows us the fearsome Vlad the Impaler cum Dracula as a sensitive husband and father and it's just repugnant, an apostasy. He's a prince with no army to protect his people, right. Alot of situations in this film are transparently contrived. Watched it with my wife, I would've bailed halfway through but she wanted to see it through for the poetic romance I think, ugh. Did you EVER think ANY retelling of Dracula would involve ""poetic romance""?! Just never again, please."
" Excellent retelling of Dracula legend
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,8,Beautifully done . Seamless distinction from Stokers Dracula and the legend of Vlad
" Luke Evans is AMAZING
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,10,"Finally a vampire movie that I can really sink my teeth into. (pardon da pun) This is the story of Vlad the Impaler and the Prince, Ruler of Transylvania with everything you could want from an action/drama/romance/thriller. It all comes together so well, the scenery is beautiful, a good solid story with top notch acting. Don't miss this one. I'm really hoping for a sequel...fingers crossed."
" Genuinely good movie
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,9,I thought this movie was fantastic. It may have not been accurate to the original story. But it was still a good story. Would highly recommend
" Absolutely great
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,10,This is the almost true story about a man who saved Europe from freedoms enemy number one in 1462.An absolutely great movie.
" Lot of reviews missed one thing
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,7,"If you compare the story with the story about Dracula as written by Bram Stoker in 1897 it is indeed not even close.What those viewers have missed the film is based upon the story of Vlad the Impaler also known as Vlad Dracula. It is believed Bram Stoker used Vlad's legend for his novel, that is where Dracula got his name from and now these two are combined.Do not watch this if you expect a horror's tale... it is a knight's tale action film with a dark fantasy layer and this one is very well made!"
" Watching for few times already
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,10,"I give 10 stars as I watched many times and watched again in 2020 during covid , doesnt matter with history, i am watching movies not reading history, if i want to read history i will go to library"
" Why using specific hystorical references if you use them in a wrong way?
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,1,"Movie fails in dramatization, general logic and plot. But what it's annoying is usage of history.
Generally it infuriates me when movies give other countries credit for vampire legend origins and for the word ""vampire"" itself. But this movie specifically infuriated me because they say the word comes from Greek, when all historical sources state that the word originates from Serbian as well as the widespread legend of vampires itself. Also, using historical references to Mehmed II being killed by Vlad Tepes is just stupid."
" A surprisingly great watch.
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,9,"I really did enjoy this movie. I love that it was about Vlad the impaler, as many people know that he was the inspiration for Dracula. But of course he's known as being quite ruthless, In this movie it's a really great twist on that. It may not be super historically accurate, Or even possible as it's about Vampires and whatnot.. But it still does an amazing job at showing how our ""Vlad"" in the movie, acted out of love and wanted to protect his family, but the end result is the same as the ""Vlad the impaler"" our history remembers.. so to me it's just a great way to tell the story. It also sets up for a sequel in my opinion, which we probably won't get.. or maybe your supposed to imagine that for yourself? I don't know.. but I do know if they had a sequel.. I would totally watch it. I do wish they would have explained a few things a little better, like why the old Vampire was stuck in the cave and why Vlad wasn't. But for the most part, it was super enjoyable and I totally recommend it."
" Underrated
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,7,"While I wouldn't classify this as a perfect film (very few that I would) I feel it's better than a 6.3 rating. 7.5 at least,, and I wish it was more than a one and done. Actually,, I think it would've been cool if they'd made a trilogy (1st movie focusing on Vlad as a kid growing into the Impaler / 2nd movie like this one / and a 3rd with him in modern day,, perhaps something dealing with his human family (descended from his son in this movie). Just an idea,,,Seriously,,, Luke Evans and Dominic Cooper are great in this one.So go watch it!!"
" Good Start - To an Old Story.... Kind of
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,8,"Forget the old.... well, not all the old. Many parallels to the legend. I was entertained and left wanting more. That to me is enough to call it a good movie. I look forward to new chapters."
" Entertainment twist on an old tale
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,6,"I enjoyed this movie. Despite its flaws, and there's many, i m drawn to movies about men who will do anything for the protection of their family. One think i didn't understand was why there where Vikings in the close guard of the Ottoman empire. Was this fact or purely made up due to a lack of actors or to merely add a sense of Vikings cruelty to the Ottomans. I don't know the answer to this but it just seemed strange for Scandinavian warriors being used high up in the Turkish military. Granted this is fiction...but it still stood out as something that went a little too far with no regard at all for historical accuracy (if that's what they were aiming for). I still think it's worth a watch."
" Perfectly titled!
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,1,"The title of this...this...this...well what does one really call this (golly I REALLY AM gagging on using the word ""movie"" here) historical creation is perfect. Why? Because at the end there was 90 minutes of something but the story of Dracula is still untold!The story that is told is the story of a marketing product. I once saw a Joe Bob Briggs monologue where he described the marketing meeting at Hasbro when the came up with the doll that ""did #2."" Dracula Untold is like the creation of one of those marketing brain storming sessions.It starts with someone saying ""Well we need to produce a horror film this year so what can we do?"" The answer is ""Let's do Dracula! Dracula hasn't been done for at least maybe four years now so we have a whole new High School class we can make it for!""""Well, do we have a script for a Dracula movie?""""Eh, we can make up the script as we go along. We can do like an origin story with all the boxes checked like tragic death of beloved and vampires who kind of seem like a cross between Blade-like vampires sometimes crossed with zombies or something. I don't know. The CGI boys and girls can figure that out in production. I got some drinking buddies who can cobble a script together in a couple of weeks and we can have this made by Halloween for sure.""""Well, OK. Sounds good to me. Make sure you set it up for sequels. We've allocated this much for production and this much for marketing for this next years horror flick so make it so. And if that concludes our business for today gentlemen I've got an afternoon tee time at Pebble Beach.""I mean...really...that is what you have. It is cobbled together Hollywood crap that is as lifeless as Dracula in a coffin in the daytime."
" Dracula Untold
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,4,"Dracula Untold is the vampire story re-imagined as a dark comic book adventure.Luke Evans plays Vlad the Impaler who as a boy was handed to the Turkish Sultan to be trained as a warrior.Now the ruler of Transylvania finds that the same fate could befall his son from the new sultan (Dominic Cooper). In order to save his people, Vlad seeks out out a Nosferatu type hermit (Charles Dance) in a cave who devours any passing human.Vlad does a deal with the vampire where he drinks some of his blood, this will give Vlad the powers of a vampire temporarily. If he resists drinking human blood for three days, then he will become human again.The juiced up Vlad, get super strength, can transform to a cloud of bats and the Turkish invaders are no match for this one man bat army.Although a choppy film. It tries to be a Tolkien type adventure with plenty of CGI battle scenes with some Gothic romance. It is moderately successful as it is colourfully entertaining thanks to Luke Evans.It is far away from the Dracula legend as you can get. It is more of an Underworld type movie crossed with Superman. There is even a scene where silver represents Kryptonite."
" Enjoyable, but misrepresents its source material
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,6,"Dracula Untold was supposed to be the first film in Universal's Dark Universe, which would bring together old movie monsters like Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, Invisible Man and the Mummy. I guess that they're still trying to do that to some degree, but this really wasn't the opening film they wanted.Dracula Untold is yet another retelling of the story of Dracula, or Vlad the Impaler, if you prefer. This time he's played by Luke Evans and the gist of his character is that he's trying to do what's best for his people, the Transylvanians. Even if that means dealing with a literal source of primordial evil. You can all see where this is going.To the film's credit, it looks great. The production value is there on the screen, from the costumes to the locations to the CGI involved. It utilizes its budget well and I have no complaints about how it looks. Luke Evans is also enjoyable, as is Charles Dance in his role, which I shall not spoil.That being said, you're not supposed to make Dracula a good guy. Especially not like this. I could buy him as a noble demon. A ruthless, bloodthirsty monster, who nevertheless has a code of conduct and might even believe that innocents should be spared where possible. Netflix's recent Castlevania series springs to mind. But making him an outright good guy, who simply falls victim to his circumstances. No, that's not Dracula. At least, not to me.Plus there are some really bad plot holes. Especially concerning characters teleporting around to be where the plot needs them to be. Shoddy editing at the very least, if not outright bad storytelling.Still, it is a spectacle. A good-looking spectacle."
" Better than expected
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,8,"First off, you can't expect all tellings of the Dracula legend to be the same. Dracula is an idea, nothing more. This is a complete retelling of the legend and has nothing to do with the well known book or previous Dracula movies, other than it is about Vampires and Transylvania. This is a story of what lengths a prince will go to to protect his people and family from foreign invaders. I would recommend giving it a look if you go in knowing it is not a traditional Dracula story. You might be pleasantly surprised...I was."
" Continue the storie

" It was a good concept
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,4,"It has a good idea on paper. But man, the characters are so poorly written (not even written it seems like). I like the first big action scene, I like some of the shoots, alongside with the cinematography, but man, at some point the movie just turns into a big hot mess.You start to get tired so quickly, of the fight scenes when you can't never tell what exactly is going on, is either that the camera is moving so much you can't even focus, or that everything is way too dark for you to see a thing.And, of course, they have the balls to set up a sequel, or whatever that was. I mean, damnit, Universal, how are you able to screw this universe up twice before it even starts? (this and Tom Cruise's Mummy, of course). It's insane, this finally is horrible, it makes no sense, you don't feel a thing for the guy, you don't care the chick looks like his wife (what's the point? It's not her).Well, there isn't much more to say, at the end, the movie is just forgettable, it goes for the easy rout every single time, it doesn't surprise you at all, and it focus more on building up sequels, than truly telling a good story. And that's how you kill a franchise, before it even begins."
" Slightly Different
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,7,For the people: This movie shows a good origination of a Dracula in the modern world and introduction to his powers. By the people.
" Excellent movie good twist on the original
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,8,Enjoyed the happier beginnings of Dracula & not the usual evil villain we've all grown up to know.
" A pleasant surprise
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,8,"For some reason, I expected a mediocre, happy ending, fantasy and after 10 minutes I thought I had the movie and the plot all figured out. But I didn't, and I'm glad that I was wrong because it was far better than I believed it would be.Luke Evans really sold his role to me, the story of him making a ""deal with the devil"" to save his family and his people was strong and compelling. The way things turn out for him, the fact that he had to kill his wife to save their son and having to become a ""monster"" for ever, makes the movie and his character even better.The way it ended I really hoped the story would continue especially since it did quite well at the box office but six years later it seems it won't."
" All vlad was missing was a fedora
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,1,"""let the games begin"" the end proves this movie was just a trailer"
" A big historical mistake
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,1,The information contained in the film is completely false. Those who read history know that Vlad was defeated by Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror
" Entertaining if ultimately average with a weak Evans
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,6,"In this, the last of the modern Universal monster remakes before they start their own shared universe consisting of the The Mummy, Wolfman, Van Helsing and others (no doubt due to the recent success of Marvel's Cinematic Universe) we have the story of a young Vlad III (played rather weakly by Evans) in the fifteenth century.We open to a quick monologue giving us a back story to the Christian-Turk wars involving the Templar's and the effects of the lengthy conflicts. In fourteen forty-two, ten years after Vlad has returned from servitude to the Turkish, Vlad's lands are at an uneasy peace with his former captives. Nothing is said of Vlad's father, nor how he returned.While out looking for scouts, Vlad and two of his closest happen upon a fissure in a cave. Upon entering the cave they meet the resident creature (Charles Dance) who quickly dispatches with Vlad's associates and is only stopped by Vlad crawling to the caves entrance, which is bathed in sunlight. Vlad then seeks out the local holy man to learn more about this monster. Naturally the peace between the Turks does not last and Vlad takes desperate measures to protect those he loves.The overall problem with this film though is that it's just not very good, despite its budget. Now don't get me wrong, the movie is certainly enjoyable and fast-paced enough to keep you interested, but it has numerous other issues which befall it. Luke Evans while a reasonable actor, comes across as a weak, camp Orlando Bloom (if that's actually possible). He is just far too soft-voiced, pretty and basically unassuming to play such a strong historical character.The script is also a major issue in my opinion. Quite often the dialogue is shockingly laughable (though not to the extent of the terribly written Bram stokers Dracula to be fair). The camerawork and photography are also not the greatest, though I will say there are some fantastic single shots littered throughout the film. I'm not sure why there was such inconsistency. There are however some nice effects and despite the blatant use of CGI, the big battle scenes are visually quite impressive.Given it was almost 20 years before Universal started making these again and will only be a few years since the last lot of reboots, it will be interesting to see how a modern audience reacts to these remade classics. To be fair to this title, they do try to be a little inventive with the setting, era and story, and overall this is an enjoyable, if not a great film.

Come on, are there any accurate movies about vampires? Also, some people rate this movie very low because they view it as islamophobic.

" Surprisingly Fantastic !
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,9,"I read the reviews on IMDb and expected it to be lame but decided to watch it as hey ....it's Dracula !
I was pleasantly surprised as it was really good ! The acting was great, the action and CGI were really good too!
Luke Evans played the role perfectly . He was strong , powerful, regal , kind, masculine, masterful , monster like , and ....sexy! He captured his struggle not to drink blood well. The way he moved when he ' turned' was brilliant .
The movie critics often get it wrong and this time they definitely did ! This movie is great ! I'm so glad I gave it a chance and watched it!"
" A different, interesting, and ever so entertaining take on Dracula
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,10,"Did anyone disregard the title? And the history thing... Why do people look at history? It isn't historical fiction.One thing I've had to learn to let go of is watching movies with premonitions. Every movie you decide to watch, turn off all of your expectations and just let the movie be the movie.I give a lot of ten star reviews, it's true, but I tend to stick to what I want to see nowadays and it isn't impossible to please me. Perfect movie : 9 stars. Drags me in and has me engaged, also completely feeling the main character, add the last star. Sometimes, when it feels distant to me because it's psychologically impossible even though it's supposed to be the real world, it knocks off a star even though perfectly made, even when it means to criticize the fact that this is the way some people see themselves.We seem to be going through the Platinum age of movies and we've been doing so for over a decade now.This movie appeals to you from a point of view of classic Hollywood romance with a classical Hollywood hero. I wouldn't call him a male Kathryn Hepburn, but hey, he's got class and it stands as such in this movie instead of criticize it like Luke Evans sometimes gets to do. He's an awful lot of fun to watch, quite possibly because behind the most wonderful and rich Hollywood-veneer he comes off as a bit of a scoundrel.I don't know whether I'm right or wrong, but throw in Sarah Gadon as his love and I do the one thing that I don't typically do : look up their names and remember them. Now, I really loved the movie and so should you. If you don't mind, I'm also going to check out the rest of the cast, because they really did do a formidable job.Don't forget : only watch movies without premonitions. And enjoy a little kickback to old school Hollywood romance and action with lots of magic and blood as you watch this one. Great movie."

" A fair-to-middling new take on an old legend.
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,6,"I think you have to treat this depiction of Dracula on it's own merits. There is no point comparing it with anything you've seen already. Given that, it is a perfectly watchable, and forgettable, adventure film with Luke Evans as Prince Vlad making the vampiric equivalent of a ""deal with the devil"" with Charles Dance to prevent his family and his kingdom from being over-run by the Turks. Dominic Cooper is really terrible as the Ottoman Sultan, though - his accent sounds like it's been finessed in his local kebab shop after too many tequila slammers on a Friday night. Expect nothing earth shattering and you won be let down."

" A Universal 300 clone
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,6,"Dracula Untold was meant to be start of the Dark Universe for Universal Studio where they attempt to bring all their monsters together. What they created was a fantasy action film that looks like Universal were trying to make their own version of 300, one nation making an unreasonable demand to another, and has a smaller nation fighting a growing element. The opening was pretty much copying the visual style of that film with a voiceover expanding the history. And for a 300 copy it is one of the better ones because it visual design, especially when Vlad goes into the vampire's cave, and had some solid action sequences. It is a shame that the film went for an R-rating because it would have offered a lot of bloody. For what it is is a passable fantasy romp."

It is set in Transylvany , fifteenth-century , a new legend is born with a creepy Dracula to fight evil , a hero will turn to darkness .Everyone Bloodline has a beginning and an ending .It deals with a young prince called Vlad Tepes , Luke Evans , also named Vlad the Impaler. When Sult√°n Mehmet II , Dominic Cooper , who is executing the Vienna siege , demands one thousand children to become into Jenizaros for the Turkish Army , the prince Vlad has two choices , whether carry out this wrong order or to rebel against Turks . Vlad Tepes chooses the latter one , as he joins his officers and forms a feared army . Later on , Vlad reluctantly agrees with a monstrousing creature , Charles Dance , to vanquish the Turk enemy . As in order to achieve power to protect his wife , Sarah Gadon , child : Art Parkinson, and inhabitants his Kingdom , he turns an eerie creature of the night , becoming forever a doomed being .Horror movie with violent fights , noisy action , impressive battles with extreme use of computer generator images and a few historical events about the Vienna siege by Sultan Mehmet II . This thrilling as well as terrifying movie packs horrifying scnes , chills , gore and breathtaking war scenes . It is not based on Bram Stoker 1897 classic novel of the same title and one of the biggest differences with original novel is that this Dracula recounting takes place entirely in a scary Transylvania , as Stoker's moves the action to England . This is a ghastly terror drama about sinister happenings with an interesting and engaging premise : Will Vlad Tepes lose his soul becoming a monster feared by his own people to save his wife , child and kingdom ¬ø . It displays a shading and dark cinematography by John Schwartzman . As well as an evocative and moving musical score by Rami Djawadi of Game of Thrones . Being well and professionally made by Gary Shore, though it has some failures , gaps and excessive frames in 3D.This one is one of the uncountable rendit√≠on about this legendary personage , freely based on the Bram Stoker character , though here is more related to historic prince Vlad Tepes or Vlad the Impaler . Other films retelling the known legend based as originally concerned on Stoker's novel are the following ones : Dracula by Terence Fisher with Christopher Lee , Peter Cushing and its sequels . Dracula by Dan Curtis with Jack Palance , Simon Ward , Nigel Davenport . Count Dracula by Jess Frank with Chistopher Lee , Herbert Lom , Soledad Miranda , Klaus Kinski . Bram Stoker's Dracula with David Suchet as Van Helsing , Marc Warren as Count Dracula and Sophia Miles as Lucy . Dracula 3D by Dario Argento with Thomas Ktretschmann , Rutger Hauer, Unax Ugalde, Marta Gastoni . The best results to be Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula with Gary Oldman , Winona Ryder , Anthony Hopkins , Gary Elwes, Keanu Reeves ."
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,4,"Had some cool parts and was good for a while before some extremely questionable parts and weird places the story went derailed the movie. Even tho the story was not at all expected or predictable, the way it did go was still unsatisfying at times. (1 viewing)

" historical pretexts
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,5,"I'm not a fan of vampire movies. The genre does not interest me at all, and there must be other good reasons to have me sit in front of a screen to see a movie that belongs to it. One of these reasons is the promise that the movie says something new about the origin of the character, invented by Bram Stoker and modeled on the deformation of Vlad Tepes' historical personality. It's what 'Dracula Untold' promised ('Untold' like in the untold story). A promise that is far from accomplished. The film directed by Gary Shore is an acceptable entertainment film, not a masterpiece and not as bad as it could have been.Historically, everything is a mess. Vlad is moved from Wallachia to Transylvania, the Cozia monastery (also moved over the mountains) becomes a fortress but with walls painted on the outside as in Bucovina, nothing in the film resembles Transylvania from then or now, which is no wonder as filming was made in Northern Ireland, and the cinematography is more like that of 'Lord of the Rings'. But there are pleasant surprises also. If we put aside any historical pretext, Vlad is portrayed as a charismatic and moral character, ready to sacrifice his humanity to save his country. The lead role actor, Luke Evans, is very good, making to look credible some of the most incredible scenes. After all, we are in an imaginary world where comics style meets vampire stories on big screens with computer graphics.Director Gary Shore (well-known from advertising films) is at his first feature film, but this is not felt at any time. He builds the story intelligently, focusing on the main character and his evolution. The film has rhythm and the graphic effects are of good quality. The end even hints to a possible sequel, although I have not heard about one having been produced or in plans. The historical pretext is totally missed, the film does not say anything about the history behind the Dracula historical character, possibly just suggesting an alternative to the origin of Bram Stoker's fictional character. The line in the end credits that officially informs us that the characters and action of the film have nothing to do with real characters, now or in history, has never been more true."
" Deserves a follow-up
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,9,The character I thought was perfect and the battle scenes pretty good... probably the best part. I would love to see a sequel to this with a bit more added to it.

",2019-05-02 00:00:00,7,"This movie is pretty good in my opinion, stays with the concept and themes of Dracula and takes on a new meaning and ideas. Yes it's not as good as it could have been it's quite short, the villain is kind of just an early 50s comic book bad guy and the love relationship between Dracula and his wife is kinda bad and not enjoyable, but the action especially in the end is pretty good the reasoning for the movie is as stated reasonable protect his son by stopping him from becoming like him.Overall it was a movie that you can enjoy and not take to hard with good acting and good fights
Would recommend watching."

",2019-04-09 00:00:00,10,"A brutal telling of Dracula with a devilish Charles Dance co-starring. Not anything like the romanticised 90s version which may please some, this tells a story of a different kind. Can't believe it only rates as a 6.3/10."
" Sometimes the world doesn't need another hero, sometimes what it needs is a monster.
",2019-04-05 00:00:00,9,"Historically there was a man named Vlad or Dracula, who as a lad was given by his father, a Transylvanian ruler, to the Turks as allegiance to be brought up in Islamic ways and trained in warfare. The Turks created a killing machine, the ultimate warrior whose name was enough to turn enemy armies on their heels. His signature stamp was the impaling of thousands. Vlad returned to rule his (Christian) country in 1462 Transylvania, modern day Romania.The movie picks up at this point in which Vlad (Luke Evans) has ruled in peace for 10 years, when Turkish leader Sultan Mehmed (Dominic Cooper) sends a demand that the Transylvanians pay jizyah, a head or poll tax that early Islamic rulers demanded from their non-Muslim subjects, plus 1,000 youths for his army. Vlad's people are horrified and outmanned, and Prince Vlad is forced to seek alternative means of satisfying the Turks. He offers himself in place of the boys, the Sultan refuses and demands Vlad's son in addition. Negotiations have failed, and Vlad is forced to seek alternate means to vanquish the Turkish armies that will no doubt fall upon them. The means has to be monumental. Vlad the Impaler, son of Dracul, transforms himself (temporarily) into a one-man unstoppable force and self-proclaimed Son of the Devil: the ultimate vampire (founded on Bram Stoker's 1897 novel 'Dracula') who can transform, fly, and has super sensory perception. But can a man, loving husband and father and protector of his people, ever come out ahead by making a pact with evil?70 million dollars invested in a set of first-timers-feature director Gary Shores and writers Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless-has paid off big time. Evans (The Hobbit, Fast & Furious 6, No One Lives, The Raven, Immortals) plays the charismatic, compassionate hero with style and grace, and his commanding good looks are well suited to the beast transformations and restrained eroticism as is his use of voice. But it is questionable whether someone who grew up committing inhumane atrocities can really allow himself to be as vulnerable and expressive as Evans in the constantly conveyed love for his wife and son, or the smouldering tension in some scenes. His wife is played by Sarah Gadon (Mutant X, Life with Derek, Flashpoint), as Mirena, who has little to do but stand by her man. Cooper (Need for Speed, Fleming (TV Mini-Series), Reasonable Doubt, Mamma Mia!, Sense and Sensibility (TV Mini-Series)) as Mehmed the Conqueror is disappointing: he sounds and acts as he did playing Saddam Hussein's son Uday and body double Latif in The Devil's Double (2011). However, Oscar awarded costume designer Ngila Dickson (The Lord of the Rings, Blood Diamond, Xena: Warrior Princess) does not disappoint.Brilliant cinematography, the animations are epic with strategic bat swarms forming at the hand and command of their master, Dracula. The sky darkening and changing that are so necessary for preserving Dracula's strength are suitably gripping. The sound effects are rich: deep rumbling, growling, earth moving. The historical connections are interesting. The editing may have been better, some scenes were too short or under developed to allow the full emotional effect, I presume this was to keep the movie within the PG 13 range.Having watched numerous versions of Dracula, this is one of the best, and the change from rampaging, blood-thirsty, unfeeling, sex-consumed creature to a thoughtful, militarily strategic, loving hero is novel. It is entertaining and a movie worth watching. My hope is that it being the first in the Universal monster franchise revamp rollout, its impact is not diluted with the expected crossover into the upcoming series of movies."
" Best Vampire Movie since the Original
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,6,"I generally abhor vampire and zombie films. I enjoyed the original Night of the Living Dead and all sequels since then are nowhere nearly as good. I also enjoyed the original Dracula with Bela Lugosi, and no remake ever since has been as good...that is, until now. The historical and legendary mix of this Dracula gives a fairly accurate account of Count Dracula, also known as Vlad the Impaler. The production values and CGI for this film is first-rate, and so are the performances of the lead actors. The real strength of this film, however, comes from the very talented screenwriters and director, who have made a classic for the ages.
The tenor of the film is quite Shakespearean, and would qualify for one of the Bard's better tragedies. There is also a wonderful twist at the end that works perfectly and sets up the inevitable sequel (don't all films of this genre have to do that?). I almost never view these types of films because i know I will be easily disappointed; but I was not disappointed with this gem."
" Awesome Movie!
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,10,"I really enjoyed this title. The story was well told, I cared about the characters, and the graphics were wonderful. The whole thing pulled me in and kept me interested and entertained and the time flew by. It was a great way to spend a cold winter evening."
" Dracula was a banal man
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,6,"The kind of film that just sort of passes by and then you think, here we go but no, that's the end. It's 90% CGI so for the actors there's not a lot to do and when there is they're very dull. I want to like the lead actor, Luke Eveans but's hes as emotive as a fatigued clam. And not sexy. Dracula must be sexy. Dracula 2000 beats this to heck."
" Fun film
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,7,"This is an entertaining film that got a lot of negative reviews here because it vaguely argues that it was no fun living under the Ottoman Turks. Surely, the film does not aspire to be a true biography of Vlad Tepes, there are many anachronisms, the accents are funny, the costumes seem off, but the Turks did collect young boys from all over the empire, they did kidnap young girls for their harems and they actually were extremely hard on the Christians. On the other hand, VAMPIRES DO NOT EXIST. It is thus ridiculous for someone who is ready to watch a film on non existent bat-like blood-drinking fiends to argue that said film is crap on account of how Sultan Mehmet was in fact ten years old at the time this story is supposed to take place."
" Dracula... A Fresh Take
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,10,"A fresh take on a terrifying figure known as Vlad the Impaler. What this film manages to do is give heart and a reason for Vlad becoming Dracula. Originally meant to be the start of the dark universe (now cancelled) Dracula Untold tells a story of love, tragedy, loss, revenge and it does it so brilliantly well. Everything from the cast and writing was on point. Luke Evans plays the titular character well and gives a much lesser dark tone than the original Bram Stoker version of Vlad, in here he's simply known as Vlad the Redeemer. The Special effects in this film were gorgeous, and being a PG 13 rated film left it rather bloodless but doesn't take anything away from the film at all. This is a highly underrated film imo and I'd recommend movie buffs go see this movie at least once, it is truly a work of art :) the ending scene alone is worth revisiting as it hinted at a possible sequel that would have been an interesting set up if it were continued (sadly it doesn't look like it'll happen)""Men do not fear swords. They fear monsters."""
" Visually lavish.
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,7,"Strong production design and cinematography are the main highlights of this otherwise laboured and overwrought film. It's not really a horror film, although there are a few shocking scenes, it's more of an action/adventure fantasy film along the lines of ""Game of Thrones"". It has some good acting and is overall entertaining on a popcorn level."
" Excellent and Different
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,9,"I found this movie very entertaining and I liked that it was different from the same old Dracula movies. Action packed, good acting and a twisted new tale of Dracula. I do not see how this has bad reviews when it is orginal and unique because it is it's own new Dracula story. I hope they make a part two since the ending led to that possibility."
" Hollowness
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,4,Never did I understand why people would give 10 stars to this movie. It lacks in consistency. I would only say this much.
" by far the best Dracula movie
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,10,"This is by far the best telling of the Dracula story. Creative and powerful background and origin, excellent characters, great acting.
Does have a lot of action but also romantic element and fantastic historical events describing Vlad the person and who he is before he becomes the monster. Doesn't play out the way you think it will.
Luke Evans is awesome and carries the role brilliantly with the necessary charisma. Charles Dance is perfect in his role.
A true gem that surprised me. And the ending is unexpected and wonderful."
" A dull drama with no real bite
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,5,"Maybe it's just the horror fanatic in me, but I just could not get past this film trying to make Vlad the Impaler a sympathetic character. The man was a monster that inspired the most iconic monster of all time, and yet they turn him into a sappy noble with a tragic backstory. With the exception of the last 30 minutes, this is a dull and drab drama with no bite."
" Absurd Scenario
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,2,"True that its a fiction movie but come on y'all, filmmakers are using historical characters. As a history major college student I found this movie terrible since its scenario is total nonsense. Briefly, there were many criterias which were applied to the recruitment of boys in the Ottoman Empire. 1 boy out of 40 households was taken and if there was only 1 boy of the family, then the Ottomans weren't taking him into the recruitment. Also, Janissaries were mostly of Albanian and Bosnian origin from West; Georgian and Armenian from East. As far as I know, Wallachia together with Moldavia had their autonomies. They might have, at least, created a scenario based on actual Christian-Muslim dispute and Vlad turning into Dracula in order to defeat Muslims. It's a big L"
" Not another re-telling of the Braums Stoker Dracula.
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,7,"A blend of history and vampire mythology, a different glance at the legendary Dracula. A young Prince (not Count) Dracula, known as Vlad Tepes, (Luke Evans), a noble hero seeks out dark powers to protect his people threatened by a mighty throng of Turks. The storyline immediately seems to be ridiculous with a highly predictable plot, but to no avail. The romantic element of willing to give up his young son and leave his beautiful wife practically unprotected to become a monster to save his believers is what matters. This foray into darkness has Vlad the impaler transforming into a swarm of bats to kick butt. Quite visual with creative action and sustainable suspense.The cast also features: Sarah Gadon, Charles Dance, Noah Huntley, Zach McGowan, Samantha Banks and Dominic Cooper."
" I forgot something
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,"The Turks did actually ask for tribute and soldiers *1000* per year from the Romanian countries, including Transylvania, so we could keep our country and customs. That part of the story is true- learned about it in school /"
" It's an awesome movie
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,"Fits most of the idea and I loved that it kept Romanian names and some of its history. Now the prob I do not like is that his wife asks him 5-10 minutes before his test to drink her blood, so he could be like a full-time vampire and save the son.I really find that to be very inappropriate, choosing to condemn her husbands soul for eternity, just so she could save the child's life, even if that meant that the child could still go to Heaven.
Her request was not just stupid, but also unloving and uncaring for the world they would live in where, what was holy or unholy was actually real."
" a take on the dracula story seen much closer to the life of Vlad the impaler
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,9,Review: I found this to be an interesting concept because it combines the history of Vlad the impaler with the legend of Dracula. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good. The cinematography is incredible. The costumes and sets fit the time period to a t which is a breath of fresh air due to this being a horror type period piece. All in all I would give this four out of a possible five stars.
" Fantastic
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,10,Very awesome movie. I don't understand why it had so many bad ratings when everyone I spoke to about the movie all loved it! I keep hoping to hear about the 2nd one coming out since the movie sets it up very well for a sequel but no news yet. Please come out with a 2nd movie with the same actors!!!
" playing with history
",2018-11-07 00:00:00,1,As regards using children in wars of turkish army in 1442 .. that is a big lie.
" PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE watch this without the 'Dracula' impresion!
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,10,"This movie frankly came as something as a shock, a good one though!I really didn't expect much from this movie, another Dracula movie but, that is as far from being the case as Alien was just another horror movie. The entire thing, scenes, photography, acting and sound was out of this world. I have no idea how this movie slipped by for so long before I got to see it and now I wish I had known what I know now then, because this would have been a must on the big screen.The special effects are better than some of the exceptionally high budget movies and frankly were faultless. Add the best acting I have seen in this genre of movie for a considerable time with the 'everything else about this movie' and you will absolutely be entertained and hopefully as impressed as was I.Ironically I didn't realize that it was Charles Dance to start with, someone as notable as he should have not escaped by notice but that is actually a testimony to the makeup and special effects. Luke Evans was so well placed in the lead role that I am even more surprised that we don't see him in some of the Marvel movies, he would be make a superb super hero or bad guy!Gary Shore should have won an oscar for the directing, if there is one thing that will fail an entire movie it is the directing, again excellent performances from all involved can only be credited to good direction. So two thumbs up there.In conclusion, watch this movie as if you have no idea about any of the Dracula stories that you may have seen, I guarantee that you will be as thrilled, riveted and fulfilled as was I."
" Luke Evans
",2018-10-06 00:00:00,10,"The naysayers of this flick just don't wanna have fun. The visuals/special effects are great; the story engaging. A fresh 21st century take on a classic. Would have really given it 8 stars, but as a gay man being able to watch Luke Evans for an hour and a half makes it a 10! :)"
" Creative
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,8,"I wasn't expecting this movie to be nearly as good as I found it. At a glance, I simply can't understand why it gets such low ratings. Sure, as someone familiar lore from the original Bram Stoker Novel, I found myself questioning whether or not this film was really meant to fit within the original cannon, or if it was meant to be part of its own alternate continuity. The latter seems to be true, but I don't see that as a problem. I've l grown to love MUCH looser takes on Dracula. As a stand-alone story, Dracula Untold takes every opportunity to steer the narrative in an interesting direction. Several times I found myself thinking, 'oh, it would be so cool if they did this next', and then they went there. The ultimate conclusion may have be forgone, but the journey sure was a ride. Everything was pretty tight. There were no parts I can recall that dragged down the pacing, which was pretty heart-pumping throughout. I loved how many little details had come back into play by the end. This version of Dracula is well preformed and also surprisingly sympathetic, even reasonable, despite being convincingly bad@#$. I enjoyed how his powers were and weaknesses were represented, and taken advantage of, with the final fight being my favorite. And for some reason, I find Dracula turning into a swarm of bats much cooler than him just turning into one. What can I say?In the end, even though this story is kind of a prequel, I'm hungry for a direct sequel."
" ""My name is Dracula, Son of the Devil!""
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,8,"The name of Dracula has for many decades been known as the name of a fictional vampire, but prior to that and for many centuries, was considered the nickname of Vlad III, or Vlad the Impaler. His father was Vlad Dracul, 'the Dragon'; 'Dracula' was another form of the name used to describe the son of Dracul. In modern Romania, Dracul means 'the Devil', and went a long way to contribute to Vlad's reputation. This 'origin' story of Dracula actually did a pretty good job of explaining all that. The film makers here took that historical component and did a commendable job of creating a vampire myth based on the legend of Vlad the Impaler, who was given a task and challenge by the Master Vampire (Charles Dance) of Broken Tooth Mountain. Taken with appropriate grains of salt, the story goes on to describe how Vlad (Luke Evans) opposed the Turkish Sultan Mehmed (Dominic Cooper), who demanded that he pay tribute to the Turks of a thousand young boys, including his own son, to form an army for further conquest of non-Turkish lands. For a good part of the story, it looked like Vlad would be able to honor a commitment to abstain from drinking the blood of a human for three days, in order to remain human himself. However the death of his wife gave rise to an outrage that could only be satisfied by consuming her blood and taking it out on Mehmed and the Turkish army. Much of what one knows about vampire lore is given treatment in the story, like the bite of a vampire creating another one, and the terror of sunlight that causes a vampire to disintegrate. Expanding on Bela Lugosi's transformation in the original 1931 ""Dracula"" film, Vlad III has the ability not only to turn into a bat, but to command legions of the flying devils to effect final victory. I guess if one is bothered by this expansion of the Bram Stoker inspired Dracula legend, the film might not appeal to you. Actually, Stoker's working papers for his novel contain no references to the historical Vlad the Impaler, and some historians question whether he even knew much about him, at least not enough to be inspired by the Thirteenth Century warrior and leader. But if it's a different kind of action/adventure film you're looking for, this one will satisfy with it's dark themes and it's unique take on the origin of the vampire legend."
" Tremendous Power at a Price
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,5,"Concerned for his family and the sovernity of his kingdom, a once-feared monarch named ""Vlad Tepes"" (Luke Evans) turns in desperation to a powerful ""Vampire"" (played by Charles Dance) for help in overcoming the approaching Turkish army of ""Mehmed II"" (Dominec Cooper). Upon accepting the terms demanded of the Vampire what Vlad doesn't fully appreciate is the power passed on to him--or the price he will have to pay. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an interesting movie which started off really well and had some good graphics to support it. Additionally, I also liked the dark and dismal setting as well. Unfortunately, the director (Gary Shore) allowed the action and CGI to get out-of-control and then made another key mistake by deviating from the normal vampire traditions by giving Vlad an excessive amount of power and ability. Yet, in spite of all of this, the movie itself was still viewable for the most part and because of that I have rated it accordingly. Average."
" Enjoyed and brought new story
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,9,I ve seen a lot of bad reviews on this film but I enjoyed it cast was fantastic and cgi was great. I ve seen a lot slam this films as it's not true to Dracula story but they have to be open minded this was a new direction and brought a few ways to continue the story it might even bring new crowd to the old films and then boom the films float around instead of being forgotten

" SOMETIMES THE WORLD NEEDS A MONSTER
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,8,"Luke Evans gives us a different type of Dracula, one I didn't expect. The childhood of Vlad is read to us. Vlad becomes the reluctant monster in order to have the strength to save his people from the Turks who are demanding 1,000 boys in addition to the tribute. Vlad enters into ""the immortal game of revenge"" to turn him into Uma Thurman on steroids.I enjoyed the set up and the initial battle. The film slowed after that until the ending fight scenes which were anti-climatic at that point.And what was that with vampires and silver? Silver is for werewolves. That made the whole film unbelievable.No F-bombs, sex, or nudity."
" Batman Begins
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,4,"Despite the critical panning of ""The Mummy"" (2017), Universal's official launching of its Dark Universe, I think they were wise to not begin the series with this one, ""Dracula Untold,"" although they've flirted with doing so. Not only is it a complete departure from Bram Stoker's novel and the prior Universal monster movies, which began with 1931's ""Dracula,"" or that it's so devoid of authenticity for the historical Vlad the Impaler or reality in general, but, worse yet, it's such a blatant and largely failed ploy at co-opting the formulae of superhero movies, such as the Dark Knight trilogy, but especially the Marvel Cinematic Universe, whose success has become the envy of all Hollywood. And, from the perspective of ignorant racist vilification, ""Dracula Untold"" is essentially a toned-down, one-man versus ""the other"" version of ""300"" (2006).I've seen over 50 Dracula-related movies now since reading Stoker's book, and it's baffling how far removed some of the mainstream tendencies in depictions of the titular character have come, to the point that essentially nothing in ""Dracula Untold"" besides the names and locations can be traced back to Stoker. I suspect at least some of the primary filmmakers involved didn't even read the book; if they did, they obviously needn't have bothered, because they didn't use it. What they obviously did, however, was view other Dracula movies, as well as the superhero ones. Two trends in Dracula movies, which owe next to nothing to Stoker, and which I've found especially irritating are the transformation of Dracula into a romantic and sympathetic figure, often through the device of a reincarnation romance, and the greater assertion of and focus upon Dracula having been the historical Vlad the Impaler. Stoker's ""Dracula"" owes its title and a couple sentences of speculation made by Van Helsing to the Vlad connection, and the earliest movie I know to even mention it is the Turkish adaptation, ""Drakula Istanbul'da"" (1953). Had Stoker cared to dwell as much as the movies have upon his character's origins, he may've learned that Vlad was the Prince of Wallachia, an entirely different country than Transylvania.For Stoker, Dracula was also plainly a barer of immorality and even a surrogate for unmentioned venereal disease. A 1974 TV movie, mistitled ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" by Dan Curtis first combined Vlad with a reincarnation romance, a trope that had already been employed by Curtis in his ""Dark Shadows"" TV series, as well as in the Dracula-esque blaxploitation flick ""Blacula"" (1972). If not the reincarnation romance, the portrayal of Dracula as a sympathetic romantic figure has persisted since in ""The Great Love of Count Dracula"" (1973), ""Dracula and Son"" (1976), ""Nosferatu"" (1979), ""Nosferatu in Venice"" (1988), the 1992 ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" ""Dracula Rising"" (1993) and other Dracula, as well as numerous other vampire, movies.Unfortunately, ""Dracula Untold"" rehashes both of these threads and puts them in a superhero origins story. Vlad becomes vampire to save family, he rather effortlessly defeats entire armies of Turks, struggles to avoid eternal damnation as vampire, but loses wife in tragic slow-motion sequence, Vlad saves son but cue another slow-motion sequence somewhere and, centuries later, Vlad sees Mina, the twin reincarnation of his dead wife, played by the same actress. And, if copying other Dracula movies and superhero movies weren't enough, they throw in Tywin Lannister informing us that the games have begun. As mindless popcorn fare, ""Dracula Untold"" isn't entirely awful, but with that setup, I'm not excited for a sequel.(Mirror Note: Dracula's reflection is seen in a sword as he kills Turks in battle. As this was during the movie's invented period where Vlad was undead but not yet condemned to an eternity as a vampire, it may be supposed that he would later not have a reflection, as Dracula shouldn't, but Stoker's Dracula also wasn't harmed by silver or sunlight, so whatever....)"
" Dracula: The dark Superman
",2018-05-14 00:00:00,7,"RELEASED IN 2014 and directed by Gary Shore, ""Dracula Untold"" tells the origin of Dracula: In the 15th century Prince Vlad the Impaler (Luke Evans) must protect his small kingdom of Wallachia (in modern-day Romania) from a Turk warlord (Dominic Cooper) who demands a thousand boys from Wallachia & Transylvania, including Vlad's son. Threatened by the unsurmountable Turk army, Vlad desperately makes a dubious pact with a formidable caged vampire in order to acquire its dark powers and save his family & kingdom. Sarah Gadon plays Vlad's winsome wife.The producers flirted with the idea of ""Dracula Untold"" being part of Universal's Dark Universe; and the epilogue of the movie, set in the modern world, suggests this, insinuating a franchise. This idea was dropped, however, and ""The Mummy"" (2017) became the first official film in the Dark Universe. In any case, ""Dracula Untold"" was fairly successful at the Box Office, making $56.3 million in North America and $217.1 million worldwide against a cost of $70 million.My title blurb pretty much tells you all you need to know: ""Dracula Untold"" is basically the dark Superman of 15th century Eastern Europe where Dracula wields the power to defeat a thousand-man army. If you like the great prologue to Coppola's ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" (1992), you'll probably like this movie, which gives several nods to that forerunner.The film LOOKS awesome and has a fine cast. But unlike ""Bram Stoker's Dracula,"" it's rapidly paced and doesn't leave much room to breathe; so the characterizations aren't quite deep enough. It's good, but somehow hollow and forgettable. ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" was perhaps a little too slow while ""Dracula Untold"" is too hurried. I wish the creators found the happy medium between the two because, with just a little bit more time and attention to detail, it could've been great.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 32 minutes and was shot entirely in Northern Ireland. WRITERS: Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless.GRADE: B"
" It was called 'Dracula Untold' for a reason.
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,8,"First off I thoroughly enjoyed 'Dracula Untold.' If you're into an anti-hero type movie with pretty decent acting (for the genre) as well as plenty of action then watch it. I'd watch a sequel to it based on how much I unexpectedly enjoyed this one.Second, people that have issues with historical inaccuracies reflect on the idea that the movie just might be a ""fictional fantasy"" film, make your peace with that and then enjoy the movie. Furthermore, sure there may be aspects that don't track with the original book but the ""untold"" part of the title kind of infers that ""this is the part that wasn't in the book."" So again if people can get past that, enjoy the movie."
" IT'S AN EPIC
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,10,"I don't understand the critics, i don't even understand people who are calling it entertaining. it's not just entertaining..... it's an amazing story of a Man (a Father, a Prince) who sacrificed everything for his family and people. i don't care if it's a fact or fiction. it was amazing, i really like the script and CGI was amazing .......Luke evans performance was epic and i like how the story portrait his character....
It was not perfect i get it....
Dominic cooper did ok , but his character was poor , they should have found something more practical and strong.But overall it was better than i expected and it deserved more respect and appreciation .....
Looking forward for its sequel....."
" Rate your life and this movie more...
",2018-04-05 00:00:00,10,"Although most people would not agree with me, i think this movie is sadly underrated.It is sad that people think some Eternal values are corny, like these:
the importance of One's family and the duty of protecting itthe relationship of parent and child, like protection from the parent side and full trust from children
protection and self-sacrifice for other people who all entrusted you with their lives or simply just hinder the evil around youthe Eternal love, admiring your partner amidst in the middle of crazy chaos
 with vibrant happiness surrounding them like an invisible force and protecting shield almost sparklingthe sanctity of the given word and promises, breaking them equals with slow death of the soulthe Eternal struggle of good and evil, where lines between the sides are blurred. It's uncertain how far One can go without crossing the line. Once crossed the border, can One remain good, and return?You can find all of the things above in this movie.
Special thank to the cast, who willy or unwittingly lived and portrayed these feelings and shared with us. I give it a 10 stars and looking forward to more other movies like this. About heroes, ordinary ""every day"" heroes, good and bad One's who could cross their boundaries so typical to our world today.They don't look for the easy way out, capable of brave sacrifice because of selflessness.
Because they know they are not the important thing in this world.Nowadays , where everyone locks themselves into their own world and bad things gain ground.The power of good is in the community,getting together and helping each other out.You don't need to protect yourself you need to protect others.Others will take care of you and they can protect you better than yourself, because they are many more.We can't reach this alone, nor without care about eachother.So this is all are in this movie. If you don't aggree with me, watch it again, and again.Not for me, but for you, for your family, for all of humanity, or the Earth...for the whole Universe.Supported by Eternal values."

" This is the definitive Dracula movie - the very best ever made
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,10,"Without exception this is the best Dracula movie ever. The story is great, as is the character development. The acting, direction, FX, and everything else is truly fantastic. Unlike every other vampire movie ever, this is an intelligent movie that tells a meaningful story. Its purpose is not to be a horror story, but a story of honor, self-sacrifice, and commitment. This is a Vlad Dracul that you can respect and admire. He is portrayed (albeit with some liberties) as a human being dealing with extraordinary circumstances. While the ending returns us to familiar territory, this is a guy that you can't help rooting for. If there ever were a direct sequel, I could see it completely rewriting the original. As with Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds, you want the antihero to destroy that which threatens him. I bought this film, first as DVD and later as on iTunes. It is a movie that the intelligent viewer - the person interested in a genuine story and not just done-to-death garbage - should buy and watch again and again. 
Young viewers in their twenties may disagree, as they tend to favor action-packed gore-fests and as they are not as well versed in the history and events of the period, and particularly those who have ever put their lives on the line for their principles, this removes a lot of the substance. But for those who like a good story backed up by an excellent production, Dracula Untold is the absolutely definitive telling of the tale - told as it should have been from the start."

",2017-11-08 00:00:00,1,"Why don't we make films that are only visually pleasing? Who really cares about historical or linguistic accuracy? Why not completely rewrite history and turn the misanthrope and mass murderer Vlad Tepes into an inquisitive if commanding, gentle if repentant good guy--things that no historical accounts ever written about the man ever reveal. Attention to detail must be something long gone for the sake of the lowest common viewer. Case in point, the monk Vlad visits is dressed in a Western habit, but the Wallachians were not Roman Catholic, they were Orthodox. Can't seem too oriental for the average joe who gluts on Horror films peopled with monks dressed in brown robes, right? Take a pass on this one. I did."
" Excellent tribute to Jack Palance 1974
",2017-10-06 00:00:00,10,Dracula Untold - (2014) Universal - This will go down in history as one of the great Dracula movies of all time. Only second to the original with Lugosi in 1931. This film is very similar to the story with Jack Palance back in 1974. Luke Evans even reminds you of Palance. The casting was PERFECT. LIKE X 100.
" First Review: Because It Was That Good
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,8,"Awesome movie, I just want another voice heard so we can get a second one, my friend showed me this movie about 9 months ago, I've watched only 3 or 4 times but it seems brand new every time I watch it. I'm a lover of the Underworlds, but I see this as a possibility of a set of movies to top them. Please keep them coming!!!"
" Garbage! Hollywood Marketing department: ""let's use the name Dracula to sell another pile of crap to an unsuspecting public""
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,1,"I'm a huge fan of horror films. Nosferatu the original silent movie was great. Dracula with Bela Lugosi was great in the beginning then goes into soap opera boring nonsense. Bela Lugosi was great! Dracula with Christopher Lee is garbage. The best part of those movies is the fashion of the sets, the cinematography and music. Sorry to break it to my fellow horror fans, but Christopher Lee sucked. Go check out his first Dracula movie. His best part is when he first appears, walks down the stairs, just before he opens his mouth. The costume and stance is great. Then he opens his mouth and what do we get? A British accent on Dracula! And his dialogue? Something about cataloging his library. His freaking LIBRARY!!! Then we movie onto Frances Copala's Dracula. Gary Oldman is a great actor. He did an amazing job portraying Dracula, especially in the beginning as Vlad III. The music was great. The screenplay and acting was trash. Keanu, Winona, Silence of the Lame actor, all suck. And the comedy! What's with the comedy? So, there we have it. Nosferatu was the best Dracula. That was a horror movie. The rest, cheese. I only saw a few minutes of the remake of Nosferatu, but I realized soon after watching that it was a poor production by a bunch of armatures.Now, we have Dracula Untold. It should have not been told. First, I saw this movie awhile ago. But what I remember is the main actor with that stupid British accent. Why not give Dracula a Hindu accent, or French accent. Why British. At least with a French accent we would be entertained. It would be like Peter Sellers Dracula. That would be entertaining. But no, we have another British Dracula. No Bela Lugosi here.The events of what I remember of this pile of garbage has nothing to do with Vlad III, or the vampire Dracula. They used the name Vlad, and Dracula to concoct another film, built around some action scenes with fast edits. The story is garbage. The acting is trash. If you don't care about a decent story, or decent acting and just want to sit back and watch a bunch of fast edit fight scenes and flashy camera work and cgi then this may be for you. Or go watch the next Avengers or Thor or Wonder Woman or Farce Awakens. They are all the same movie. It's just candy. Go ahead eat it. It's bad for you. But it tastes so good. Keep buying it and they'll keep feeding you this garbage.Now if you like this movie, you may not have enough patience to watch a silent movie like Nosferatu. That is the real shame here. One should understand that movies, like all media, are a reflection of our culture. Give the audience candy, keep them dumb, and they'll keep coming back for more.God help us, everyone!"
" EXCELLENT in EVERY WAy. Best Dracula I've seen
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,10,"Luke Evans is EXCELLENT in this Dracula. I loved this movie through and through. Sexy, mysterious, NOT PREDICTABLE, not ""kiddy"" and too ""blockbuster"" like. Luke plays this role with superior vulnerability and power. He is amazing.I love how the movie evolves, the goon in the cave,,,how every scene Dracula is in charge. I hate movies that make the ""hero"" weak and get kicked around. Even the last scene where he was in silver..at end when he whipped around in face..like he was toying with him all the time.Loved the bat scenes..how his face changed to so cool, scary, creepy..the growling!!! Not the fake, phony plastic faces that some movies do. Everything about this movie was so cool.Please bring back Luke Evans and do a sequel. LOVED the ending..I hope I read wrong that Universal is not putting this on side as it was by far SUPERIOR to the ridiculous 2017 tom cruise Mummy. That movie sucks so bad. Predictable, too childish, too starlet chasing Tom ..havent we seen enough of this. Mummy reminds me of the Indiana Jones..tough guy, girl..then everything is laughable and over done with special effects.This movie, is NOT OVERDONE. Scenes are super cool without being too fake. It is a great movie. I should know.I watched it 5 times.Universal, you need more believable scary movies..with mystery and story..not junk like Mummy..if that is direction you are going..you are losing all ""adult"" fans.If you however, bring Luke back and more movies like this Drakula Untold..you will have way more fans and loyal new ones. Im so sick of the kid types..and the starlet famous lead ones..how many transformer type movies do we have to tolerate (or better ignore) before we get a really good spook flick. This one is a keeper. It is awesome~! Never get tired of watching this 3 years later.This one is good. Watch it people."
" Wonderful melding of Fact and Fiction and also Bram Stokers novel
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,9,"Just loved this Dracula movie - being a Dracula buff both the fictional & Vlad The Impaler, and knowing the myths and legends and stories etc etc, I thought that this tied all the historical (fact and or fictional)and also Bram Stokers novel together (with Vlad meeting Mina at the end of the movie) really well as to how Dracula may have ""began"". Yes it is not that historically accurate but, then how many movies are and this is not a documentary - it is a work of fiction.I enjoyed watching it so much have gone and bought the DVD. I thought both Luke Evans and Dominic Cooper were excellent choices and loved Charles Dance as the first ""Dracula"". The movie is exciting and well paced and I certainly was not wanting to get up and miss any of it. Even my son and teenage grandson enjoyed it and they are both more into movies like fast and furious or Bruce Willis type action films, but even they sat glued to it and it is certainly not a real blood and guts gory type movie either. Loved every minute of it."
" The Myth of Vlad Dracula and His Family.
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,8,"It was a movie about Dracula but not from the horror perspective, instead the film maker inserted stories based on myths and a little bit of history in this movie. In my opinion it was more like an action film than a horror flick, but overall this was a good movie and really entertained to see. The moral story of this movie is family should always comes first,no matter the circumstances.Familia siempre viene primero."
" Such a cool Vampire film!
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,9,"I love this movie! First of all, I am super-stoked about the Universal ""Dark Universe"" franchise getting the kick-off with The Mummy. So I have been going over my excellent, classic Universal Monster movies (I am only missing TIM and TCFTBL compilation DVDs, which I will get) and I am going full-immersion with the genre again! While this film does not attempt to ""reboot"" the 1931 Dracula film, it is a fun, action- packed, fantasy-type thriller. It reminds me of a cross between a Vampire film and The Lord of The Rings (or The Last Samurai). Luke Evans is the man, truly. The guy was born to play these ""period""- epics (like his role in The Hobbit films and in The Raven and The Three Musketeers) and I loved him as Gaston in the new BATB. The only reason I couldn't give it an unqualified 10-stars is due to the regrettable reliance on CGI- effects. Ah, I guess it's to be expected, these days. They serve the story and I just have to work on ""suspending disbelief"" a bit more than I would otherwise. But, that aside, the film does work with action, horror-elements and pathos. It is a good story, along the lines of ""Game of Thrones"" and films of that ilk. It rocks! See it!"
" An Amazing film regardless if you like history or not
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,9,"I absolutely adore this film and would recommend this to everyone. I find it extremely insulting that various critics act like this movie is a holy cross warding off the History fans like we are evil monsters hiding in the darkness. I was a former History major and learned all about the Ottoman Empire, probably more than any of you other critics ever learned. The Ottoman's were a horrible evil empire that invaded most of Europe but were ultimately stopped by Vlad and pushed back, eventually leading to their complete defeat as well as collapse in World War I (WWI). No one seems to ever care to learn about the Ottomans in terms of Europe invading great powers, often preferring to think of Napolean and Rome and the Nazi's but the Ottomans were also a major conquering power. They were once formed with the hope of uniting the Mid East, not created to be a force of evil yet their purpose became twisted over the years.Dracula is a fictional character that was created as a story book character inspired by the legend of Vlad the Impaler. If you are a real history fan you know all of this, if you are not a history fan don't lie and pretend you are one.I still believe tying this fictional character and the man inspired by him, tying them together, was a beautiful creative unique idea. Vlad sadly is mostly known only for inspiring the creation of Dracula, why not connect the two further?In terms of the film, Charles Dance does an outstanding job in this film as well as Luke Evans. I would say easily this is my favorite film with these two actors. I would also say this is one of my favorite vampire movies i have ever seen.I cannot express enough this does NOT follow the traditional story book tale of Dracula. He's not some arrogant lady's man seducing women tricking them drinking their blood and being the ultimate night hunter of women. If you look to Dracula and see only that, then you won't be happy. I personally like this version of Dracula better, i feel as if it makes the character more real and easier to relate with. I have watched this movie hundreds of times and will continue to watch it again and again in the future. I do not say it is a guilty pleasure as it is one of the best dark Gothic/ monster movies i have ever seen and to me guilty pleasure would be a film truly bad (many for instance debate the Transformers films as being very bad). Dracula Untold is simply a fantastic movie and deeply enjoyable.I guess if this movie has any problems, you don't really understand Vlad's commanders or the Sultan, their motives are very thin however i would say most of the movie's strength lies on Vlad and his family plus some amazing star power with Charles Dance as the master vampire. This movie is severely underrated."
" An amazing remake of Dracula!
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,10,"True, its loosely based on Vlad The Impaler, but Luke Evans and the story thanks to the incredible writers will have you rooting for Dracula. And if that is not enough, the special effects are flawless and filled with plenty of action, packed into a beautiful package. Considering the fact that Vlad was the inspiration for Bram Stoker's Dracula, I have to say that this story which is closer to the real events in history (Minus the blood sucking vampire part) is a much more entertaining experience as the Bram Stoker version has been done and re-done multiple times. Quite honestly I am ecstatic that i didn't see a face with excessive foundation to give it that pale-vamp-twilight look!Its a shame that this was a big box office hit, considering all the trash that climbs over the Billion dollar returns these days. I really hope they come out with a sequel to this soon. My Review is a perfect 10/10"
" yo its a sick movie so chill and give it a 10
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,10,"I open google, type the movie's name and expect to see a 9.5/10 IMDb but see 6, feels-badman, I'm a very picky and cringing movie watcher, if I see something not very well done I just close my eyes and face-palm, but this movie is something to be remembered as one of the most well done pieces of art to hit the cinemas. Yea it did perhaps have some parts of the story different and empty than of the legends told in stories but the main bulk of it is nailed 10/10."
" Historically Accurate? Who Cares, it's Awesome Entertainment
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,8,"Who can't appreciate a fight scene shown on the mirror edge of a sword? Or traveling swiftly as a swarm of bats? The special affects were beautifully crafted. This isn't a documentary, but superb entertainment.The setting and costumes of the highest caliber. The story thoughtful, the characters complex and full. Paced perfectly.Score haunting. Action packed, and a backstory of a romance. Perfect movie to watch together as a couple, or a family with older children!"
" nice movie ,,,,
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,5,"in short ,, John Hunyadi keep away Otomans long enough ,, but who saved the Europe & Ballkan from Otomans was 'Scanderbeg' or in my language George Kastrioti , not even a single word about him in movie ,, interesting , while Vivaldi composer make and Opera in three acts 1718. wish soon Hollywood make a movie about True Hero not just for (Illyrian-Dardanian)Albanians but for all Europe ,, keep away those dirty Turks. 500 years of war with them , and never a single word in their language , we keep ''Pellazg-Illyrian'' Language as God give to Us ,, today Dardania-Albania they try to assimilate and just God know what they try but never Victorius ."
" Entertaining - I Enjoy It!
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,9,"It's a Hollywood movie - entertainment - not a history lesson! The story borrows heavily from the real life Vlad Tepes and his real battles BUT it is not an accurate depiction of it - the film doesn't pretend to be either. The movie add lots of Fantasy and Fiction to the true story in order to entertain it's audiences - I for one am entertained by the film.I like Luke Evans as Vlad Tepes - a fresh face for the character and he's a good, quality actor in my eyes. The rest of the actors a good in this one too - really good in their roles.CGI? - Yes it's in here like most films of today but it's not abused! I think it's well done and in good taste for a film of this type.The story - new, exciting, and a refreshing tale of it's own. The battle a many and a bit graphic - so if that's not your thing then I would tell you ""you might wanna pass on this one film then"".Eye-candy when it comes to the costumes and sets! A real medieval look and feel to the it. Darkness splashed with bright colors with superb cinematography adding to overall eeriness of the dark.It's not much of a Horror film - more of War, Action and Fantasy but there are elements of Horror splashed in the mix of genres.Overall, I really like this movie!! And will watch it again! 9/10"
" Flawed attempt to breathe new life into an old story
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,4,"Dracula Untold is an attempt to breathe new life into the vampire legend by telling the fateful story of Vlad Tepes, aka Vlad the Impaler, and looking at the circumstances that led to him becoming one of the most notorious figures in European history. This is an unashamedly supernatural story featuring Charles Dance as an age-old scaly vampire and lots of supernatural moments involving neck-biting and the like.While I appreciate the new angle this film approaches the story from, I have to say that in terms of execution it falls flat. It's not really a horror film at all, more of an action picture like the UNDERWORLD films albeit with a historical setting. Most of the film consists of mindless battle sequences accompanied by incessant swarms of CGI bats and the like. Luke Evans is a weak and ineffectual lead and the likes of Dominic Cooper, Paul Kaye, Ronan Vibert, and Zach McGowan are wasted in support with absolutely nothing to do other than go through the motions. It's a real waste of time and money."
" Reminded me of later Castlevania video games
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,9,"Before i watch the movie i had seen very mediocre critics but i was quite anxious to watch it even from the first time i watched the trailer. The movie was like watching a resent Castlevania video game. For that reason it did very good. I quite enjoyed the movie. Bad votes probably from those unfamiliar with the games, so maybe they didn't know what they were watching. It is a movie i'd like to watch again."
" Dracula, with a Dash of Thor and King Leonidas
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,7,"Dracula untold is an enjoyable, if curious, take on the classic vampire tale, and Luke Evans gives a commanding presence as Vlad, bestowing upon him noble family and patriotic reasons for opting to transform into the titular bloodsucker. Visually, the film is a treat and in terms of theme and tone it is essentially a superhero take on Dracula, with a large portion of 300-style warrior antics thrown in for good measure (not forgetting a dash of romance, too). As such, the film is never dull and nor does the pace ever flag. However, with so many genres battling for attention, inevitably there are points that needed more detail, most significantly that of Dominic Cooper's character, the Sultan. As Dracula's antagonist, he is a little sketchy, a factor all the more evident when his convenient and unexplained knowledge of vampire 'Kryptonite' comes in to play within the climactic battle. Sadly, the final scene hints at the promise of further Dracula adventures in the modern world that have so far failed to materialize, which is a shame as the world seems ready for Super-Drac."
" Fantastic!
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,10,"I love Dracula since I was a little girl and have always been obsessed. Dracula Untold exceeded all expectations. It was suspenseful and with a well explained plot, no getting lost in this story. Luke Evans did a fantastic job of playing the role and being easy on the eyes doesn't hurt. I really do hope they consider filming a part 2 after leaving us all thinking there would be with the ending in the movie. I have watched it more times than i can count at this point and am very disappointed to still hear they have no news on whether or not they will make a part two. If you want action (lots), suspense, and love this is the movie. It has it all! PLEASE MAKE A PART 2!!!!!!!"
" Showed love of family , protection of the people but on the other side, depicted wrong image of the Turkish Emperor.
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,1,"Could have been a better movie if it would have not tangled with the history.This movie challenged the true story and history. It is accepted that Vlad was a ruthless warrior, but it is awful to show against one of the greatest emperor of all time Mehmat-al- fetih, who conquered the byzantine empire, in one of the epic battles of history, yet he gave freedom of religion in his new kingdom. Also the history shows that Mehmat-al- fetih died naturally much long after the death of Vlad (Dracula).Luke Evans is a good actor and I liked his work in the Hobbit series but not in this movie.He took the one of the character which history recognise as a negative one which this movie tried to show a sympathetic one by introducing his love for his child."
