" Decent with funny parts...
",2021-04-05 00:00:00,6,"I liked his dancing foot moves the best... Unrealistic movie, but fun and entertaining with some funny parts... Although mostly dumb movie, but had some good parts that made me laugh..."
" Fun show
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,7,This is a fun show with some ridiculous elements. But the actors somehow pull it off.
" Great Movie
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,8,"This movie was a lot better than I expected. Normally when movies try to mix action and comedy it's an epic fail. But I can honestly say they did this movie right. It was so good, so cute, so funny and it had a good plot. This is the first time I wrote a review so that should tell you something right there. If you like action and you like comedy this movie is a must see."
" LOVED IT!!!!
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely loved it! It was quirky, fun and hilarious! ... Well, by my somewhat off sense of humor anyway lol... A great find, I can't believe I hadn't seen it before!"
" Fun. Nothing else. Just fun.
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,8,"Mr. Right made me realize that I have not seen a true popcorn movie in over a year. It seems like ages ago that I sat down and enjoyed a movie that doesn't build an obstacle for its protagnoists to overcome and call it a story. Sure there are small obstacles, but this film thrives when it is just moving our protagonist foward with success after success instyle and fun-loving energy.There are times in Act 1 when it is awkward, and it certainly doesn't try to accomplish anything new, but Mr. Right was the Right kind of popcorn movie I needed to turn my brain off to tonight."
" Perfect date night movie!
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,9,Watch it on a date bro!! This movie has a great love story enough to entertain the ladies. Has enough action to be amazing. On top of that it's funny.
" Anyone who gives this movie lower than 7...
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,10,"Anyone who gave this movie lower than a 7 has to be a miserable human being. OR, Or, had preconceived notions about and action movie staring Tim Roth. Other than that, How could this not be a Gem!!??This movie was Funny, Action packed and Adorable (Anna Kendrick lol )10/10My D.H. put this on after a small disagreement, (He left something flammable on the stove) I was MADD!! He put Mr.Right on, within 8 mins I was attached to the TV and within 15 We both were laughing and hooting!"
" Quirky fun and action
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,9,"Love, love, love this movie. Romance, action, adventure all rolled into one. The on screen chemistry between Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell is great. Don't miss out on this feel good movie."
" The best!
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,10,"This is my ultimate go to feel good movie. Love it! It's so beautifully done, the stupid, I mean. It's just spot on!"
" Sam Rockwell delivers brilliantly in this great comedy
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,9,"Who's to say that a romantic comedy can't get a nine? I'll try to keep this simple and short. I was a film major so I could get technical but for the purposes of this review I don't think that's necessary. Sam Rockwell is severely underappreciated. It wasn't until he got an Oscar for his supporting role in three billboards outside ebbing Missouri, That he finally got the recognition he deserved for a long time. Anna Kendrick pairs well with him. Conceptually this movie is great and the execution is spot on. A rom-com doesn't have to be cinematic brilliance to be a great film. This hits all the right notes and is an absolute joy. I wish they make more movies like this. It's just as good the second time."
" Absolute Favorite Film
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,10,"I am bananas about this film. I have literally watched it on repeat over a full day. It is hilarious, sweet, violent, unique, and absolutely lovely. I just can't get enough."
" Quirky dark romcom. I loved it.
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,9,"Just go with it. So funny! Great screen writing.
These two leads also have chemistry. Very dark violence but still works. Not to be taken seriously. Simply great adult fun."
" ""Let's focus on one psycho at a time.""
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,5,"If you can get past the first ten or fifteen minutes or so, you might be okay. It starts out so valley girlish you might think you have the wrong picture. Anna Kendrick's portrayal of her character went beyond quirky and to me was just plain annoying. I like Sam Rockwell, so he was a bit of a saving grace for the picture, but even he had to engage in some atrociously whacky dialog. As an accomplished international assassin, Francis (Rockwell) finds that he has some remorse for his past, so with that as a premise, the story takes an Orwellian turn. Francis is so disturbed about killing people for hire, that he takes it out on anyone who wants him to fulfill a contract, and kills them instead! What an adorable trait for a would be boyfriend. So that's the deal, and valley girl Martha (Kendrick) falls right in line after some initial reservations about her poor choice in men. Even the bad guys in the film are pretty pathetic, and I know this was supposed to be somewhat absurd to begin with, but the follow through just screamed out 'dumb'. The icing on the cake was Martha joining in the fun by killing a couple gangsters to seal the relationship at the finale. They probably deserved each other."
" One Hell of a Love story
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,9,"One of the funniest shoot-em-up love stories this year. Sam Rockwell's moves are smooth and slick. Anna Kendrick's wacky personality is great.A great light-hearted movie. I look forward to the sequel, hopefully Mr & Mrs Right. The last scene sets it up nicely."
" Quirky offbeat rom-com for assassins?
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,8,This tips rom-coms on its side. For the good! Quirky characters mixed with love and graceful moves. Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick are amazing together. Watch if you dig odd balls and dance fighting.
" A note to whomever edited the fight scenes....
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,4,"You're not working on a Guy Ritchie movie from the early 2000s. As soon as an action scenes start out comes the shaky cam and here come a million unnecessary quick cuts. Stop doing that. As for the rest of the movie, isn't alight. It's really stupid in some parts but other parts are fun and Sam Rockwell is great so yeah, watch it if you have nothing else to do. But fair warning it can get dumb."
" Mr Right is one of the - if not THE best romantic comedy with action - ever made!!
",2021-01-07 00:00:00,10,"Reviewer who posted on ""12 April 2016 lnvicta"" is a complete and utter nincompoop.
Man or woman, you will LOVE this movie - unless you are likewise a lummox - in which case I ain't talkin' to your type."
" Excellent Lighthearted Movie - Fun To Watch - Actor/Actress Chemistry
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,10,01/06/2021 I found it cute and funny throughout the movie which is what should be expected. The two actors Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell play off each other really well much to our enjoyment. A good lighthearted movie that everyone should have enjoyed? Negative low reviews more readily reflect on the person leaving the review then it does the quality of this well crafted movie. This was my second or third watch? Watch for yourself and decide. Bon Appetit'
" OMG Funny
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,9,"If you are like me and you are a Sam Rockwell, you will absolutely love this movie, I cannot believe it took me me 5 years to find this one, absolute gem.Being a big fan of both Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell might help, but this movie is just downright funny, violent, but funny.If you are looking for a light hearted rom com this is probably not for you, there is a bit of swearing and lots of violence, shooting and dead bad guys, but it really is super fun and just downright funny.A great job by all involved. 9/10 for the laughs and being a feel good movie."
" Don't take it too seriously
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,9,This move is just a silly over the top romantic action comedy that shouldn't be taken to seriously.
" I freakin love this movie!!
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,10,"I don't understand why this movie has such a low rating! It's the best f*ing movie istg! It's funny, cute, has action and romance! And the acting is great! Seriously 10/10 would recommend."
" Sam Rockwell deserves an award for this movie
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,8,"This movie was a rom com, love story and after watching it, I cannot imagine anyone else playing that role other than Sam Rockwell. He was the perfect amount of quirky and badass. Roger Ebert once said if you cannot picture anyone else playing that part, then they deserve a nomination at least. I cannot imagine anyone doing what Sam Rockwell did with this role. Bravo."
" Excellent
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,8,Loved this one and it had lots of action and comedy. Highly recommend this film to adults only
" Horrible
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,1,"Dont watch. This was quite literally the worst film I have had the misfortune to watch. I think the other reviewers watched another movie, this was just.... AWFUL"
" Deadpool without the Superheroes
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,10,Truly shows off a lot of the amazing talent that is Sam Rockwell
" cheesy,unfunny, and nonsensical
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,3,"The movie starts off bad and only gets worse. The plot is terrible, which I might have been able to overlook if the movie was actually funny. It wasnt. Unless you like simple cheesy humor, you might not laugh the entire movie. I was begging for the end by the midway point."
" Underrated awesomeness
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,10,"I have watched this movie multiple times, and I appreciate it more and more each time. The amazing spark between the main actor and actress is wonderful, the fun banter, and effortless humor and connection is amazing. The storyline is unique, humorous, and action-filled. Highly recommend"
" They were told to go play themselves but annoying versions of!
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,4,"Not sure that I whole-heartedly agree with the three words IMDB use to describe this film. Sam Rockwell plays a hitman who is going through a bit of an existential crisis about his life, think Martin Blank but less cool and more annoying. Anna Kendrick plays Anna Kendrick but slightly more annoying and hyper. They fall for each other, even though he is obviously mental and wrong un and slowly she starts to change to become more emotionally disturbed than he is. I mean, she makes a freaking great psycho, absolutely scary as you like, I could see her in a future remake of Single White Female. Oh yeah and Tim Roth pops up to growl his way through his scenes and generally play as Tim Roth. So, we have Sam Rockwell, Anna Kendrick and Tim Roth playing versions of themselves but irritating versions. I am being harsh because I like all three as actors, but this film did not work as whole for me. It had its moments of comedy and a bit of action that ramped up the excitement levels, but I am not surprised that this one passed me by on the first go around. A watch it only if you are obsessed with one of these actors 8/20 from someone who is still slightly scared by Miss Kendrick's character."
" Mr Right is amazing!
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,10,"I had so much fun watching this movie. Great story, super funny, and the action scenes are beautifully choreographed. I really really hope they come out with a second one. There's so much they can do with it. Id really like to see more of Martha's story line and why she has the same gift. Highly recommend."
" Love this movie!
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,10,"When I first watched this movie I was confused somewhat, but I found it funny, but as the movie progressed on, I fell a little more in love with it and by the end I was hooked. I love Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick, and how they're just a wee bit crazy, but the movie is also self-aware. Like the antagonists even keep saying how their plan makes no sense and is terrible...I just love it. Worth the watch. Or if you're me, you'll keep re-watching it because I want the kind of love where someone else's crazy matches mine <3"
" ""A Good Man is Hard to Kill""
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,8,"Great watch, will watch again, and do recommend.This has a very special recipe of madness to it, I honestly don't know how to tell you how this movie FEELS. Sam Rockwell has a very particular style of acting to begin with, and telling him to turn it up to eleven turns out amazingly. Anna Kendrick, better know for ""I'm a teen girl"" acting than intense action roles keeps every pace with Rockwell in both action and madness.While we get whiplash from how likeable Kendrick's character is before Rockwell comes in, the fun of the movie quickly takes off in both action and writing. As ""Mr. Right"" carries chaos in his wake, it starts to develop multi-threading between the two characters, and while Rockwell is the main focus for majority of the movie, I think it is equal part leads between the two.There is some funny business in the 3rd act as they do some things that would normally be 1st act establishing events, but one becomes a mini-arc of the 3rd act, and the other just isn't explained at all, unless I misunderstood.The only other movie that is even close to this is ""Wanted"", and that's pretty superficial, the higher philosophical points aren't presented in the same manner at all, the movies ""feel"" completely differently, but they both focus on the morality of killing and high reflexes.Definitely give this one a go if you like action movies, it's a lot of fun."
" Underrated movie gold
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,9,"This movie is just pure gold. It has comedy, romance, action... Great actors too. Sam and Anna have awesome chemistry. This is a great movie for every occasion. Makes me wish I met some crazy killer. 😂I have been hoping for a sequel!"
" Surprisingly decent
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,7,"A rom/com/action hybrid that was actually pretty good. I know, that surprised me too. Sam Rockwell plays a hitman who kills the people who hire him (because killing is wrong obviously), and Anna Kendrick plays a charming yet eccentric alcoholic who may just be completely crazy. And you know what? It's much, much better than it sounds..."
" LOVED THIS MOVIE!
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,10,"The characters are so loveable, Sam Rockwell has always been one of my favorite actors, when I watched this i felt goosebumps! I am a sucker for love at first sight 😍 and his character and the things he says, and the way he moves,and the fact he is a BADASS hit man with a conscience! I fell head over heels for him!! Reminds me of the All time best Love story movie TRUE ROMANCE"
" An hour and a half of my life wasted
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,1,"Okay..... WHAT THE F DID I JUST WATCH?!
It's fast paced, attempting to be dark, attempting the be funny and attempting to me romantic but it just fell flat in all aspects. The only scene that was good in the whole love was the ending after the completion of the story line. Just.....yikes. It wasn't even bad enough to be called ""brutal"" in any aspect . It was plain bad, mediocre, weird and boring."
" I enjoyed it a LOT more than I thought I would!
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,7,"Sure, this is far from a perfect movie but I still enjoyed the heck out of it. I thought the leads had good chemistry together. It just felt fun to me and lighthearted which is the tone I think the director was going for.
This is one of those movies that was made more out of a passion project or just for the heck of it and not meant to be a blockbuster. I can respect that. Not every movie needs to be done in order to make a lot of money or win awards!
Is this a movie for serious action or rom-com fans? Probably not. But if you're a fan of mash ups and don't mind the goofiness then you will probably enjoy this movie. :)"
" A barely entertaining fluff piece
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,4,"This is a really lightweight film. Sam Rockwell was great as usual, Anna Kendrick was good. Absolutely adorable. And Tim Roth was decent. But it was basically a 90 minute cartoon. A live action cartoon, that required ridiculous leaps of faith. If you're into Fast and the furious or of you liked the Transformers, if you're into that kind of nonsense, the amusement park dribble that Hollywood pumps out you might find this moderately entertaining. I considered it to be a waste of time."
" Love this movie so much! Review 980 too
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,10,"So wildly entertaining, I love the style and way it was written; I need to own it! Mr. Right might not be for everyone but I absolutely love everything about the movie. Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick are so great together, I cant believe the movie isn't talked about more. The director needs to more awesome fun time projects."
" Tone-deaf. Did we see the same movie?
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,3,"I am flabbergasted by the plethora of reviews praising the comedy and storytelling (it actually contains neither) of this travesty. Were they paid off? This wasn't given a real theatrical release and it's plain to see why. How Sam Rockwell, Anna Kendrick, and Tim Roth were coaxed into this mess will forever be a mystery. Universal probably gave it to Netflix for free, begging to clear it off the shelf of movies not meant to see the light of day.
Max Landis, even before the MeToo movement that came knocking on his door, was on borrowed time as a benefactor of industry nepotism and scarcely a shred of talent. This movie's script proves that beyond a shadow of a doubt.
Just a tone-deaf mess that falls flat on its face in every single scene."
" Bad
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,1,U should have a got a good looking hero. He is not perfect AT ALL. Thus the whole movie looks NOT INTERESTING.
" Surprising
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,7,"I didn't expect how funny this movie would be. At first you think the characters are just messed up, then you realize how hilarious they are together. It's kind of a new role for Anna who, as usual, pulled a wonderful performance. This was delightful!"
" So freakin cute
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,9,"Yah, it's unbelievable, but that's not why they made it. Anna Kendrick weighs 90lbs of course she can't beat up grown men, but it was hilarious and cute. She's nuts and he's insane, it's sweet. I'm in love with Sam Rockwell and I thought he was great, like usual. People watch it for what it is, a cute, funny movie."
" Complete garbage
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,1,The reviews are obviously planted to make it look a good movie. The movie seems like it was written by 8-year olds. Keep looking. This one was a waste of 90 minutes.
" Like Sam Rockwell but this? nah
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,1,"I watch almost all movies of sam rockwell but this is.. he's like 47 and this movie tries to be funny and have all violence hollywood is require to include to make it a good movie but the thing is, it seems like a movie for kids but it ain't, it's like it was directed by someone from the bollywood, if that makes any sense."
" Just a fun show
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,10,Really a fun show and good way to relax and just enjoy a couple hours. This is a great fun movie that in no way takes itself or movies seriously. It does not try to send a message or teach some life lesson. Just a bit a fun and enjoyment.
" A pale intimidation of Shane Black's style
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,3,"Mr. Right was a film with a promising premise and talented cast but did not live to its potential. It was written by Max Landis, one of the biggest hacks in Hollywood as used to Mr. Right as a way to make a Shane Black style film, but lacked the wit and intelligence of his films. Mr. Right neither funny or have a compelling plot.Plus Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick were an odd couple because he looks old enough to be her dad. The director had to use flashy camera and editing tricks to mask the fact that the action scenes weren't good. He couldn't hide the low budget."
" A nice surprise
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,10,"I have always been a fan of Anna Kendrick. And sam Rockwell is a pleasure to watch as per usual (he really floats when he dances). Together they make the perfect pair in this movie. Their dialogue is funny and realistic (""you say that now but later in the car...."") (also the whole scene leading up to their first kiss) and even though the plot is obviously far fetched, it is a fun ride when you don't take it too seriously. This is the most fun dark/light comedy I've seen in a while. It's definitely one you can watch several times over."
" Fantastic, outside the box romantic comedy
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,10,"If I had to Marie Kondo all the romantic comedies I've ever seen, Mr Right would without hesitation be a keeper because it definitely sparks joy. Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick have firecracking chemistry, the story moves at a rollicking pace, the supporting actors are all outstanding, really, what's not to love? There's no over the top violence, no OTT sex, just crazy, fun, black humor. One of the few romantic comedies I can watch over and over and never tire of it. All thumbs up!"
" Favorite romcom ever!!
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,7,I don't like boring movies like The Notebook or The Time Travelers Wife. I like something with a little spice. And this film has all that and more! I was laughing through most of it and when I wasn't I was admiring the adorable connection between the two main characters!
" Hello....rip off of ""knight and day""
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,5,"It was kind of awkward to watch, and yet I liked it for some reason. But if you break the movie down there isn't much too it. I love Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell and they're ability to play of each other's comedy is great, but he's a lot older than her so that was odd. And ""Knight and Day"" with Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz was too close to the same concept and they did it better if I'm being honest. I don't feel this movie's plot was deep enough and the ending lacked excitement."
" Quirky, action fun
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,9,"Definitely will only appeal to those that can appreciate the quirky characters and humor. The acting was perfect in my book. Even the minor characters got me engaged. Contains violence that may disturb some since it is not taken seriously. But it is a movie that is a diversion from the mundane, serious world. Unexpectantly this has become one of my favorite guilty pleasure movies right next to ""So I Married an Axe Murderer"". Do not watch if violence bothers you, though."
" Unexpected fun movie
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,10,"My husband and I randomly picked this movie because we saw Sam Rockwell. We were so pleasantly surprised. The plot is just for fun. No thinking required, just sit back and enjoy. I can't remember the last time I laughed out loud so often at the silly predicaments and witty dialogue. Very clever movie. It is really what we all need more of-laughs!"
" Haha murdering people is funny
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,4,"The premise of this movie just doesn't work. As entertaining as Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick are to watch, I just couldn't find myself to like the movie because the tone is just off. The writing is also kinda bad at times with awkward dialogue. What a shame."
" A puerile comedy
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,4,"This comedy is good as a background entertainment while texting your friends. Anna Kendric is superb in this and her character has some depth in it. But the story about the hitman who falls for her and the killers who chase him feels so fake and one dimensional one actually feels nothing for the lot. The story is puerile despite some violence and not good enough for
escapist entertainment"
" Just took #1 on my Top 10 of all time!
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,10,"From the get go I was sold on this movie! Sam Rockwell is a living legend and Anna Kendrick is a real life Disney Princess that has a mouth like a drunken sailor. Everything about this movie is gold to me! I have personally started using the line ""it's a conscious decision...I'm completely f*n bananas!"" as my motto in life. I wish this story line would spawn many sequels but alas I'm sure I am the only one to probably feel that way."
" ""The clown nose is tacky."" This movie is wacky and weird.
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,6,"And yet: I still watched it all the way through. Seriously, ""Mr. Right"" is surprisingly good.
I say ""surprisingly"" because... I'm a fan of Anna Kendrick, but I've found some of her recent movies to be pretty 'out there'...and kinda unappealing to my personal taste.
So here it is: would I pay big bucks for this movie? No, to be perfectly honest, I wouldn't. But it's still surprisingly watchable, if you happen to find it playing on TV. I don't normally go for silly or outrageous movies; 'quirky' is about as weird as I can go, with film. And man, this ones got it in spades.
Some of the dialogue is cringey, yes, and it ends up a weird ""action-rom-com"" situation (kind of like PP3, but no Acapella)...some of the direction also had me questioning Anna Kendrick's scene instructions. During the first couple action sequences, AK is literally just standing in the background with a subdued look. Really, in the scenes where your ""Mr. Right"" is facing off with some violent weirdos, your main girlfriend character is just hangin' out?I wasn't as head over heels as I usually am for Ms. Kendrick in this movie, but I think that's more to do with her (slightly cuckoo) character than AK herself. She's not quite believable here, but I'll give her a pass because I like her so very much. To her credit, she and Sam Rockwell do make for a very unlikely pair. Her character Martha, does have more to do, action-wise toward the end of the movie, but the use of character still seemed off, to me.Plus one for the wackness of a character named ""Johnny Moon"". I still don't know if that was his actual name, but it was entertaining.
Plus another for Anna Kendrick's (Martha's) little jabs and quips at ""Johnny Moon"" and his posse.
Ultimately forgettable, but a reasonably entertaining way to pass 1+ hours."
" Holy guacamole!! 😂
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,9,This is the craziest most screwed up funniest movie I may have ever seen! I don't know what it is about this movie but I'd totally watch it again @ again. Maybe it's the chemistry between Anna Kendrick & Sam Rockwell.
" Grosse Point Blank Redux
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,9,"Contract killer, protagonist's conscience development, quirky love interest, other contract killer trying to kill the contract killer protagonist. All it needed was a high school reunion and it'd be a match. Rockwell is Cusack, Kendrick is Driver, Roth is Aykroyd.Overall, it's an enjoyable diversion from Hollywood monotony. Enjoy it for what it is, I did."
" A Very Good Attempt But With Mixed Results
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,7,"Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell star in this comedy action thriller where Rockwell, a hitman, falls for Kendrick's character. This strongly plotted and character driven movie unfortunately has the director allowing Anna and Sam to what appears to be ad-libbing many of their comedic lines especially in the first half of the movie. The raw live-comedy routine unfortunately only goes so far even with editing as the jokes seem at times great and smooth but at other times forced and lame. Nevertheless, the gritty nature of the movie mixed in with the humor and light-hearted elements that form the foundation of the movie almost gel and the extensive attempt to introduce a serious but righteous twist to the Rockwell's character is quite admirable and commendable. Such efforts lift this typical assassin comedy thriller above the ranks of the ordinary.But with the saturation of assassin, spy movies over the years has set a very high bar for any movie attempting to find itself in this competitive genre. Other more consistently smooth mainstream as well as independent movies which succeed even further than Mr. Right include: True Lies (1994), Pulp Fiction (1994), The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996), Grosse Pointe Blank (1997), The Whole Nine Yards (2000), Red (2010), Wild Target (2010), Daisy & Violet (2011), This Means War (2012), Miss Meadows (2014), American Ultra (2015), and Killing Eve (television series, 2018). With a little more direction and editing along with a tad more refined script, Mr. Right could have obtained its place among these entertaining in most cases superlative list of cynical, humorous, action thrillers of killers, hitmen, assassins, and spies."
" I wish I could unsee it.
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,3,"Worst movie I've watched in a while. I usually like the movies Anna Kendrick is in, but this one was awful.Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick had no chemistry at all.
And this is supposed to be a romcom?! Sam Rockwell's character's personality is so weird it made me uncomfortable throughout the whole movie, and he's not even super attractive.
Anna Kendrick's character felt like an idiotic child - which made the age gap of the couple even creepier - who has as many mental problems as Sam Rockwell's character.I don't even know why I watched the whole thing.I would say that maybe with different actors this movie would have been better... but this concept was already used in the movie Knight and Day and indeed that was an entertaining action romcom that worked very well!"
" What a turkey! Completely forced, with bad lead casting!
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,2,"This movie is boring, loaded with cliches, bad casting, and annoying tones. Anna Kendrick is mal-cast as a quirky tough-girl. She could not pull this roll off because she had no depth or actual connection to the character. It seemed like she was doing schtick the whole time.Her love interest appeared to be way too old for her.The ""comedy"" fell completely flat. They were trying to make tough guys have a funny, human side, like in Pulp Fiction, but it all just seemed disconnected and written.I almost bailed on the movie about 5 times, but I didn't want to have to go on another big hunt to find an afternoon movie to watch.Overall, it felt mechanical, concocted, and riddled with notes from the development executives.Other than the script being lame, the biggest problem was the poor casting of Anna Kendrick in that role.It did have some great fight choreography though."
" ""Super good. Super good.""
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,10,"Martha McKay is my spirit animal.I'm in my phase of watching this movie over and over and, not intentionally, memorizing the dialogue. I did buy two copies of the DVD, one is in my computer at work, the other here at home for when Netflix takes it off their active list. I love this movie from the opening credits and ""Have a nice day!"" to ""Whatcha looking at?""""One of you hussies is getting fisted.""""What if it was a bullet? Training you...""""In the metaphor, do you think I won or lost?""""Not getting serial killed by a cartoon character.""""And bonus tigers...""""Can you fry whipped cream?""""That's so gnarly!""Sorry, I just needed to play the multi-stage intro in my head...I now think Anna Kendrick was born to play unhinged. Over the top, that's her address.I'm 66 as of this writing, yes I am autistic but I am not unintelligent. I have difficulty understanding human connections and emotion, so the apparent lack of ""normal"" here spoke to my soul. Francis' (but don't call him that) brain damage leaves him still so much more organized than Martha Agatha's resident inner chaos, and he recognizes he's just the partner to help her harness it.I have trouble with speaking, turning thought into speech, so it is wonderful to me to see people being witty, or corny, back and forth and I know that it's scripted but it's something that is out of reach for me and so I ache for it. This movie provides so much playful dialogue, and that exposes how objectively damaged all the characters are. I <3 screenwriters and film editors.I think ""Mr. Right II: Diggin' It"" should feature her turn at being the Rescue Ranger. Just sayin'."
" Tries too hard
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,3,"This movie tried way too hard to be cool and funny and edgy, which results in a one note boring mess. The acting is good, but literally all of the jokes fall flat, I don't think I laughed out loud once. There's really no chemistry between the main characters. It's just all very bland. Well choreographed fight scenes though."
" Netflix 3/27/2020 during Corona Virus Voluntary Quarantine
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie. It was sweet, suspenseful, funny, and romantic. I was completely distracted from reality. The lead actress and leading man were believable. Thanks for the uplifting experience."
" You will or you won't
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,7,"If you like Anna Kendrick you'll like this movie. If you don't, you won't."
" Surprisingly Great
",2020-03-09 00:00:00,7,"What a ride. Rockwell's character IS the likable bad guy. Nothing is missing from this movie unless you forgot your popcorn. The lead characters are all well cast and well played, same for the supports. Plot is fun without too much complication. Moves swiftly and never gets bogged down with unnecessary scenes or backstories. Enjoy!"
" Reviews made it sound better than it is
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,4,"Maybe I'm just not a fan of Anna Kendrick.. this role she played really seemed like it was meant for teenagers. Really immature and not funny for me. Sam was alright but everything felt very scripted. I had a hard time figuring out his character. The action scenes were alright but you could tell they were fake. The story sounded really intriguing but I was put off by the corniness and immaturity of the characters. The movie is maybe good for a 17 year old girl but as a 26 year old woman, I just wasn't a fan of any of it."
" if you don't like it you watched the wrong movie
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,10,"This is an amazing movie, everyone else is just wrong. If you went in expecting Love, Actually then you are going to be disappointed, but if you're looking for a feel-good movie about finding and accepting yourself and finding someone who you can be that person with, this is AMAZING. So many people who are just watching the wrong movie have given it a bad name. I understand how people could have been tricked by the advertising misrepresenting it, but really this is an amazing movie."
" Pretty Good Action-Comedy
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,6,"Sam Rockwell, Anna Kendrick and Tim Roth star in this 2015 action-comedy.
Kendrick plays Martha, a young yet quirky woman who is trying to get over a failed relationship. Soon, she finds romance with happy-go-lucky guy, Francis (Rockwell) whom she discovers is a hitman killing only those who employ him. Roth plays Hopper, Francis' former partner. This is a pretty good flick, Rockwell & Kendrick are great in this and together. I recommend this, especially if you enjoy romantic comedies."
" Best movie in a long time!
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,9,"This is a great film. Best movie I've seen in a long time. It's fun, violent, and hilarious. Sam and Anna kill it together! Just grab a drink and watch it!"
" Middle of the road quirk and banter fest
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,5,"Mr. Right
Directed by Paco Cabezas. Written by Max Landis
Sometimes you're flipping through the movie selections and you see something that sounds like it might be intriguing. You don't have any other alternatives so you roll the dice on it. That's how we end up with something like Mr. Right. It stars Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell. I enjoy them when they're acting. So why not take a chance on this flick? What's the harm?It's one of those extra quippy movies where the banter never stops. Sam Rockwell shows up and is instantly attracted to Anna Kendrick. Boom they're off to the races with one liners and back and forth for the entirety of the film. Sam Rockwell is a hitman with a conscience. Some people don't want him to leave the life. Hijinks ensue.You've probably seen this before. This is certainly a formula film. The jokes land with a solid thud. They try to be as quirky as they can be and that only goes so far. If you're not on that wave length, it can become grating to one's poor nerves. This movie grates on your nerves. It is nowhere near as clever or as funny as it thinks it is.But it does eventually settle into an action movie. This is fine but there does not appear to be any stakes. This makes the incredibly drawn out third act hard to get in line with. I'm not on the wavelength for the comedy and the movie doesn't care enough to provide stakes for the action. Where do we go from here?I could hit up the performances. Sam Rockwell is as charming as ever. It's not something he couldn't do in his sleep. Anna Kendrick is a ball of anxiety and nerves. Also something else she can do easily without even trying. So the movie is hoping we can get behind their relationship and the quirks and charisma that they bring to the table. I could somewhat. They still seem mismatched but I could get behind their relationship until something is realized and it comes out of nowhere. I'm not going to say more but it is never explained and it takes you completely out of the movie.I have to stay in the middle of the road for this picture. It has its moments but it's not a movie I can recommend. I give it a C."
" Weak attempted copy of Knight & Day
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,4,"Sam Rockwell is always great, but even he couldn't save this movie from attempting to be funny SO BAD it's brutal to watch. Well, not brutal, but pretty dang rough. Anna Kendrick is normally charming but who knows what she's doing here, I don't. Watching her attempt to Act like she's drunk is cringe worthy to the max."
" Rubish
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,1,One of the worst movies in a year or so. This is trying really hard to get all cute about a murderer and a ditz. Stupid give it a pass
" Mr and Mrs Right
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,7,"Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell should be in more movies together. They were wonderfully adorable, charismatic and hilarious. This movie is charming and fun. It knows what it is too. This isn't going for an Oscar. It's not trying to be a cinematic masterpiece. It's just a fun little flick, and I think it absolutely succeeds at that"
" Don't listen to reviews
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,10,"My boyfriend randomly out it on, and I notoriously can't keep off my phone, or stay still during at home movies.. well my eyes were glued to the screen. We both loved this movie. It has romance, comedy, action, and easy to watch. Do not take this movie serious, it's supposed to be fun/quirky!"
" HORRIBLE
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,1,"This is the worst movie ever. I'm embarrassed for the only worthwhile actor who appears in it - Anson Mount. The writing, the acting, the actors and the plot reek of immaturity and making a quick buck. I couldn't watch more than half an hour and then only because I was trying to be polite to my boyfriend who inadvertently put it on without knowing what it was 'just to fall asleep to'. Well he sure fell asleep, and I fell sick with disgust. Avoid at all costs!!!!"
" It's like a book you can't put down
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,8,Rockwell and Kendrick just click as a pair of hilarious psychos. Watching them was one of the most fun hour and a halves I've had in a long time. They've played the wacky ones in the room before but as solos. Here they are the perfect wacky duet and play it throughout.
" Comes out of nowhere.
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,10,"Fantastic movie, very funny and completely underrated. Do yourself a favor give this movie chance."
" Funny AF
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,10,This movie is so funny it should have a sequel or a TV show where they travel the world hiding from and killing people who are after them!
" Kendrick and Roth were great, but....
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,7,"Firstly, this movie is NOT an Action or RomCom. Expecting either genre will result in disappointment. This movie is a generally effective film of the genre Screwball Comedy.It becomes apparent that this is a screwball comedy when the items in the store are caught by the two, and their initial courtship, followed by the improbable pursuit of Roth's character. The screen banter between Kendrick and Roth is excellent and the tasteful lack of nude scenes added some romantic points.
Ms Kendrick excels at making That Face when the story departs from reality... say like when Matthew Patel and his Evil Demon Hipster Chicks started their singing in Scott Pilgrim.... I think it's called the ""Wednesday Thursday Friday"" face... or at least I think that's what the letters stand for. Anyway, Ms Kendrick does it better than anyone. And once she accepts the screwball reality, she and the audience are really on board.My complaints: The setup was dreary and, sorry, should have been rethought. Maybe they made the beginning so bad in order to lower audience expectations. The actors don't seem to be to blame... Kendrick couldn't make me believe that she was angry with her roommates, but I blame whoever thought up the scene in the first place. If John Wayne is your talent, don't put him in a scene written for Pauly Shore.
Also, during one of the combat scenes, someone took a ten inch combat knife into his rectum., and the film was paused so that the audience could laugh. Who, exactly, thinks that's funny?Other than these points of the director/producer not doing their jobs, the story and acting were clever and fun so long as the viewer buys into the screwball comedy aspect."
" So much fun!
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,10,"I feel like I've just been to an amusement park after watching this! By the time it was over, I was laughing and cheering in my house all alone. I always enjoy Sam Rockwell (love his dance moves) and Anna Kendrick, and the two of them together made for a great romp. The entire cast was terrific, the action scenes weren't dull (I usually find fight scenes dull) and reminded me a bit of ""Kill Bill"", and the dialogue was fast and fun.Best twist on a romantic comedy I've seen in a long time. Best movie ending I've seen in quite some time, as well."
" Quirky funny hitman-style romantic comedy
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,9,"This movie was a rare treat! It had great music right from the start, quirky humor, weird but cute characters you fall in love with as fast as they fall for each other, smooth action and slow motion scenes, and even the plot, as ridiculous as it is, has a nice progression and satisfying ending as well. I really enjoyed the romantic part and how the two characters fit together, and the relationship jokes just make it even more special ****** SPOILER ALERT****** (""You say that now, but then in the car you'll be like...""). It's a hilarious romantic comedy that I think can fit the rare category that satisfies both the girlfriend and the boyfriend, and I hope many people will enjoy it as much as I did!"
" Unique take yet another assassin movie but in Comedy
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,9,"Chick Flick that men would love and can learn from. Sam Rockwell AKA Francis Character is of course the honest abe in the relationship, I found this unique and on point for the women's perspective because who wants a guy that lies to them by giving them a false name from the beginning? The truth is that assassins do not have relationships because of this fact and because of this it is completely Science Fictional along with the Dragons... hehe spoiler about the dragons. Anna Kendrick does an impossible job of being this women with an amazing gift that she has not harness yet and Francis somehow sees it and falls in love with it , It is like finding the most rarest gem in the world and there is nothing like it and that is one hell of a love story. Tim Roth is ok, I would of wanted to see more of a fight scene from him because he did mention he was Francis mentor and trainer, so I imagine we would see more into that aspect of the confrontation instead the movie Director pushed more towards editing this movie in being a Love story. I believe the problem with this movie started because they had a difference of opinion with the guarantors of this movie that provided the money, The director wanted a comedy slash serious action but the people that funded him wanted a comedy slash love type movie and when that happen it really shows the movie could've gone either way. regardless Rockwell did an amazing job holding this movie together, I hope to see a sequel of this movie with the duel together of a more james bond type setting. OH BY THE WAY if a sequel is made please bring Shotgun Steve as an operative along with bruce."
" Solid movie, never slows down.
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,8,Funny comic-hitman movie. I was entertained the entire time.I never laughed out loud... But I did chuckle throughout.
" Very entertaining!! Great story line and the action is great!
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,10,"A very lighthearted film with a pseudo rom-com-violent-loving vibe!👍🏼
Well worth the view !!Sad they won't make a second. Rockwell and Kendrick are great together !!"
" Funny movie with an edge to it
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,9,I completely missed this movie when it came out has a name like a chick flick but I loved it. Best Anna Kendrick movie without a doubt and Sam Rothwell was great as always. Beautifully written and directed a movie you can go back and watch again and again. I wish it had more success when it came out so they would make another one.
" Not too bad
",2020-02-19 00:00:00,7,"It's your basic theme of hitmen and killers can actually be cuddly and loving people once you get to know them, and they do an ok job with it, but nothing close to classics like ""Leon, The Professional"". The only reason I gave it a 7 was for Kendricks role. She is so good at playing the innocent young woman with a nasty bravado streak inside waiting to come out I couldn't help but love it."
" Waste of time
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,2,"One person described this movie as ""just good fun.""
This might be fun for someone who takes enjoyment from sticking needles in their eyes. My recommendation is not to watch this flick if you have been overdosing on coffee, Red Bull or Mountain Dew.
This advice is made by a non medical spokesperson. I can't believe that Tim Roth agreed to do this after reading the script. See how long you can watch without removing it from your watch list."
" Perfect. Just perfect.
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,10,"Seriously, what more do people want out of a movie. Funny, romantic, exciting, action packed, crazy."
" SO funny!
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,10,"I came across this movie on Netflix and had no clue it existed. I love Anna Kendrick, so I figured we would give it a try. This action comedy is so fun! I legit laughed out loud throughout this movie. LOVED IT!!"
" Perfect mix of chemistry, weird and quirky
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,7,"A hitman who doesn't want to be a hitman anymore and falls in love - it's a weird premise but it's carried to perfection by Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick. Both share a great chemistry and while this movie is certainly not for everyone, I thought it was a charming and fun romp, underscored by a lot of beautifully choreographed violence and good laughs"
" Age gap?
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,3,Sam Rockwell & Anna Kendrick are usually entertaining to watch as other people in a movie. When it came to them as the leads they could not carry this one. In fairness I should have know that going into this one.
" Fun.
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,8,"There are many wordy reviews of the film, clearly some people get it and some don't. All you need to know before clicking play of Netflix is...do you like Sam Rockwell being Sam Rockwell (dancing/being delightfully odd) and Anna Kendrick (doing her odd shtick). Do like want to see them involved in preposterous gun fights?And Tim Roth being Tim Roth?I like all the above and thus, love this stupid, idiotic, happy film."
" Daft fun.
",2020-01-14 00:00:00,8,"A similar tone to Knight and Day but with romance established much earlier.
Sam Rockwell is phenomenally charismatic and funny as well as being John Wick deadly.
Anna Kendrick is really good as the unassuming everywoman with skills of her own."
" Stunning
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,10,"I really feel this movie was neglected, people rarely talk about it but it's honestly stunning. It's honest, it's comedy, it's action, it's thrill, it's love. It's gorgeous.
I can't explain it but it leaves you with a thrill when you watch it. I just finished watching it and I'm watching it again. I am not a fan of impulse moments but this shows that some impulse moments lead to amazing things, this movie. Stunning."
" Rom Com Action Done Mr. Rightly
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,7,"This movie is slick, I mean it feels very suave. Every moment gracefully moves into the next one. The performances are one sided and basic, but they're done well and make it an enjoyable watch. This movie is just as much of a romance movie as it is a action movie. Some of the action is even pretty brutal and intense. It's a fun movie with good acting and charm to it. It's a shame this movie bombed as hard as it did, because the potential for a sequel is pretty high given the ending of the film."
" just AWFUL
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,1,"Watched and than skimmed through - to get to the end. Silly but not funny.
this premise is ridiculous, but it's boring along the way
I can't find anything to watch on HBO_ I've watch some and others I can't stand.
they have some good older movies, a handful of shows, but I've seen them."
" Great Movie
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,10,"I found this movie by chance as I was scrolling late at night. It was witty, face paced, and entertaining. I will watch this more than once. The whole cast crushed their work and the joy comes through."
" Underrated!!
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,10,I think this film is perfect. Their love is so cute and the story is so absorbing. Mr. True 2 will never exist but i'll wait :D
" Great Fun.. laughed mucho!
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,10,If you are looking for some good laughs this is one for you. Sometimes it good to watch a film that isn't deep or complex. Enjoy! 😊
" Disappointed
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,3,"I love both Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick but I don't understand why this movie has so many high ratings. It was very bland, not funny and childish. Martha is very ditzy, innocent and naive, I couldn't stand it.
The movies plot didn't keep my interest and I'm being generous with my rating."
" So funny!
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,10,This movie is so much fun. I really love it. Every time I watch it it brightens my day and the chemistry and quirkiness of the two of them works sosososo well.
" Quirky RomCom
",2019-10-28 00:00:00,7,Was expecting a pretty formulaic romcom but surprised by the different slant this movie takes which made it... as romcoms go... much more enjoyable. Not likely to win an Oscar but for a Saturday evening in... great entertainment
" What the movie business is all about.
",2019-10-17 00:00:00,10,"All that movies are supposed to do is take you away from your life to another world and give you an experience which you enjoy. That is all that is important. This does that and more. What a great, free flowing, passionate, exciting, unusual movie it is. I predicted his academy award when I saw what Sam did with this role. Wonderful movie, wonderful actors. Sit back and enjoy and leave your world behind. Clearly the promoters didn't understand the movie business, when they did not back this excellent film."
" This movie has everything!
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,10,"From the soundtrack to the casting, the script and the undeniable chemistry between Rockwell and Kendrick, what is not to like? My wife HATES RomComs, and has this movie memorized - THAT is a testament to the fine line walked by Mr. Right. Personally, I want a sequel now!! This has the potential to be a great Netflix series, as long as they can get Rockwell, Kendrick, and RZA and recapture the balance of action, comedy, and romance without making it seem corny.
Okay, after reading my last sentence, I realize that would be a near impossible task, but dammit, I still want a sequel!!!"
" Did not expect to laugh this much!
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,8,"I thought this was going to be a run of the mill romcom.I am glad to say it was much funnier than I thought, full of quirky whitty little moments and some excellent action/fight scenes.Sam Rockwell excelled as the eccentric zany killer.The only negative, Tim Roth's Alabama accent is truly woeful... Like beyond woeful."
" Has great humour and lots of action too
",2019-10-09 00:00:00,7,"The movie stars a hitman that (sometimes) has super powers (Sam Rockwell) and his new massively impulsive girlfriend (Anna Kendrick). Not only can he (sometimes) sense things around him before they happen but also (sometimes) slow time at will, but he can impart his powers to other people too (like his new girlfriend, for instance).Apart from the scatterbrained plot, the movie actually has some good humour. I'm not somebody who laughs easily, but this movie had me laughing a couple of times. And this is probably off-topic, but Sam & Anna make a believable and very cute couple in the movie. The movie has a nice amount of action too, and it doesn't dwell too long on the backstory of the characters or other non-sense like that.Overall, it's a good comedy-action movie, well worth the watch. 7.5 out of 10.
PS. Pointing out that he has powers isn't a spoiler, since it's shown in the trailer of the movie that he has powers, so yeah, anything shown in the trailer, isn't a spoiler."
" Horrible
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,2,"Couldn't finish it. Cheesy script, unconvincing acting. Unmoving 'romance'. Unrealistic and choppy action scenes."
" Loved it
",2019-10-04 00:00:00,9,"Great fun, light hearted, doesn't take itself too serious. Why can't films just be enjoyed for what they are and not scrutinised? 🤦‍♀️ Watch it for what it is and you'll enjoy it...... would love to see a mr right 2"
" Hitman meets Vulnerable Adult
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,3,Sam Rockwell was brilliant but this film felt all wrong - Like it was trying to serve too many masters. Anna Kendrick was too twee to come across as a killer - so just comes across as a bit mentally ill.Rubbish.
" Odious
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,2,"This is supposed to be a light rom com but simply fails despite having a cast that others would cut an arm off to employ. Well, three cast members anyway - the headliners.The direction is heavy handed and persistently annoying. In fact, annoying is the byword for this entire mess. Here's an example: Rockwell is supposed to have such fast reactions that he can move to block a shotgun blast from only a few feet away. Here's another: Rockwell is alone being attacked by 8 or so guys. They line up in two rows in front of him rather than doing a simple surround putting him in the kill sack.But when the script pathetically calls for tension by having him and Kendrick captured, he suddenly has the reaction time of a sloth.Kendrick's charm shines through the miserable script which portrays her as the type of person who, in real life, would be stomped time and again on general principles.The only character I liked was played by Katie Nehra who was Anna's roomie. I felt her sympathetic and beautiful. It seems after being exposed to this mess, she quit the films.Kendrick has the potential to be this gen's Carole Lombard, but she needs to be choosy about what vehicles she's in. This one made money but it did her no good."
" It's weird and and wonderful.
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,10,"Quirky, hilarious, Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick are perfect comedy duo."
" Really Fun!
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,9,I saw that this was given a low rating of 6.3 and nearly didn't watch it. Delighted I listened to my girlfriend and watched it! Very fun for an evening in !!
" Simple but funny hitman romcom
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,10,"Girl meets guy & learns he really is a hitman. She can't help falling in love with him. He can't help falling in love with her. A bunch of guys want to kill him. Silly idiots. Good laughs, so ignore the bad reviews. This is a fun movie. Especially if you ever had a list of folks you would like to kill."
" Dumb and dumber
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,3,"A really stupid, lame, lazy movie. A payday cheque for Sam Rockwell and Tim Roth who earn it until the script and director let them both down. Anna Kendrick is as unwatchable as ever which is a pity as a little restraint from the director would improve her performance.
Shame as this could have been a really smart and funny movie and I only watched it hoping it would turn out to be so."
" Loved it
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,10,"Funny, easy watching kind of movie. Never a dull moment!"
" Romantic Action Comedy
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,7,"A woman breaks up with her scum bag boyfriend and goes on a bender.
Following this she catches the eye of a psychopathic hit man and they hit it off.This is a romantic comedy - action movie hybrid.
For this to work both the romance and the violence has to be reeled back in a bit diluting both genres.
This isn't a problem for Mr Right as it is also very funny.
There are jokes about relationships and murder and both me and my girlfriend enjoyed this immensely.There is a really great balancing act here between Anna Kendrick's sweetness vs Sam Rockwell's craziness and Tim Roth's cold, British, pragmatism.
All three do an amazing job and the characters work well.The story feels very familiar and there isn't anything particularly new here (this film is 5 years old at time of review) but it chugs along happily.I found the ending was a little too cheesy and made me cringe a little.This is good fun!
It is probably best not too hard about it just soak up the action, the romance and the one liners"
" Absurdly implausible, gut-giggling, ridiculous but romantic!
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,10,"So if you need cheering up, suspend everything and watch the absurdly implausible, gut-giggling, ridiculous but romantic Mr Right!
Sam Rockwell rocks as a screw-loose hitman - and it's nice to see him playing lead not just that whiny annoying character that paid his rent.
Tim Roth does Tim Roth in just the right measure. And RZA pulls the perfect punches in his cameo as ""Steve"". All with beautiful New Orleans as a backdrop for no other reason, it feels, than why not?
I don't like formulaic romcoms but the writer changed it up a bit with this - Max Landis landing just the right mix with this action-romcom. Paco Cabezas directs a very diverting hour and a half!"
" Rockwell is exquisite. This is a batty and insane take on the rom-com.
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,8,"Rockwell is a God. I would want no other actor for this role. Adorable, quirky, threatening, intense and goofy are difficult attributes to juggle and he effortlessly radiates them all in one single glance.Anna Kendrick, a comedic force in her own right, is a compatible player and they make for a credible couple. It's a tough ask to match Rockwell in his comfort zone and her attempts show a little at times, but casting wise, no other actress would make a better fit.The premise is insane, but perhaps somewhere in the world it's happening as we speak - an assassin who assassinates those who seek his services rather than the intended victims, falls in love and manages to harness the inner, untapped, quirky-violent nature of his new damsel while taking down an old foe and an enraged crime cartel... yikes...The antagonist in Tim Roth is perfectly cast and hauntingly real. The minor, cardboard villains who are quarreling dysfunctional mob brothers played by Anson Mount and James Ransone seem, unfortunately, set up to be hard to credit from the outset and this weakens the plot. Had they more bite like Roth, the darker elements of the script and Kendrick's character arc at the end may have resonated more effectively.All being said I love this film. It made my day. It's easily re-watchable and perfect for movie night. Rockwell is key."
" A good Hit Man and Love film
",2019-09-05 00:00:00,10,This is a very good film if you want a romantic movie with lots of action this is the film for you. Fighting scenes are pretty much decent as a Hit Man movie and the love story is well written indeed and the main actors doing their jobs magnificently.
" HIGHLY RECOMMEND
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,10,"This movie was a cinematic masterpiece. It has the perfect amount of humor and action all rolled in one. The wacky main character finds her Mr. Right, who turns out to be a hit man with an unusual sense of morality. This movie would be perfect for those with a cynical sense of humor, and people who love the gore that comes with action movies. To top it off, the film has the most hilariously perfect couple with the weirdest love story. It's an amazing movie, I'd highly recommend."
" Funny movie that never takes itself seriously.
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,9,"A tad bit simple at time to time, but a solid script, well shot action and an all around funny and snappy atitude makes this a perfect watch for when you just wanna be entertained without too much thinking."
" I started out unimpressed, but ended up really liking it.
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,7,"My reservations at the beginning of this movie were simply that, in the early romantic comedy scenes, Rockwell (whom I love) is simply too old for Anna Kendrick. The actors are 16 years apart, but Kendrick looks young for her age and Rockwell looks old* for his age, magnifying the effect.But, as the film descends into utter madness, you realize that these two super hero/super villain/ psychos are perfect for each other, and with interests so...unusual...they would never find anyone else, so bless 'em.Watch this if, against your better judgment, you're always a little sad that Veronica & JD don't end up together at the end of Heathers. Oh, and RZA is an under-appreciated acting talent.*But he's a great little dancer."
" It's really a good combination of action and comedy
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,9,It's a good movie.i laughed many times when i seeing this movie. You will see how love can change people and doing crazy things that's all i can say about it. Happy watching
" Why was this not turned into a tv series?
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,8,This movie was very entertaining had a little bit of everything for everyone. Was funny has action little bit of romance. This movie with these exact actors should have been made into a tv series that I bet would be successful unto this day.
" my notes
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,6,"I have to start by saying this movie overall is pretty stupid, can't really be taken seriously, and has a LOT of dumb stuff. like ridiculously stupid things happen. all that said, i enjoyed this movie. it was pretty funny, sam rockwell is amazing, and some of the action was pretty decent. I was surprised and how much i laughed at anna kendrick's character. when it started i thought she would do the typical girly humor. but she was really funny (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
so apparently he has some kind of super powers or can use the force or something, and can easily teach her to use it to. lmao when they first showed that i couldn't believe it. before that i was wondering why they didn't give this a wide release because it started pretty well, and then he teaches her the super powers and i realized that's probably why."
" Awesome
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,10,"I'm truly happy that I sign up for a subscription with HBO just to watch this movie. It's a keeper!! It is a total Romantic Comedy with some spice and action. Anna Kendrick character's excitement and dramatics kept me laughing. Sam Rockwell's character was great as well. Overall if you didn't like the movie then you most likely don't see the beauty in everyday life. Lol Just smile, laugh, and be happy!"
" Save yourself
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,1,"Please spare 1h and 33min of your precious time and DONT watch this movie. Plane torture.
The only character that was remotely bearable was Steve and he had 5 min screen time.
I should have just ended my misery and pause the movie but i watched it til the end and it only got WORSE.
This is my first review and I usually don't do this, but I felt the need to warn my fellow humans."

" Brilliant fun
",2019-04-12 00:00:00,10,"This film is great fun and such a laugh from the start. The whole cast is great, brilliant really. One of the funnest films to watch I've seen in a while. Great laugh."
" one of the few comedies that is at least funny
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,5,"The one thing that I can admit is good about this movie is the humor. Not gonna lie, some scenes really made me laugh. Also Sam Rockwell was perfect for this role. He looks like charismatic and easy-going type of guy so he did a great job playing this character. But other than that, the movie was pretty ridiculous and bizarre. Some of the lines and characters were so silly. I get that they were trying to create this unusual type of love story mixed with humor and in some scenes it worked out to be an okay mixture of both but some moments were just awfully odd (not in the good way)."
" Even funnier than ""Kill Me 3 Times""
",2019-03-14 00:00:00,7,"Murder is not entertainment when done in a wanton, sadistic Tarantino kind of way. But when you put 2 wackos together like Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick in this film it is downright hilarious. They manage to engage the audience in a way that ""Kill Me 3 Times"" didn't because, funny though it was, none of the characters was actually a nice person, with the exception of Alice Braga.
Of course it gets dangerous when they actually start to enjoy it. I'm not sure a vigilante sequel of them knocking off bad people around the world would be able to sustain the sympathy - it would have to be very well written. But with the two leads they might just be able to get away with it. It would be nice to see RZA return too if there is a sequel, as he did a great job with his role. And there's always Tim Roth's secret boss for a handy villain. Or the father of the gang leaders, referred to on a number of occasions, out to avenge their deaths."
" Hilarious, crazy and just brilliant fun
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,10,"This is one of my favourite films. I discovered it by accident and it is now my go to film if I need to laugh. It is very easy to watch and the two leads nail their characters.The film doesn't take itself seriously, it is just fun from start to finish."
" So much fun
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,10,Loved it. Some blood but never serious violence. Like a fun dance with shooting. Whole cast is great. Loved this
" Sam Rockwell dancing and killing
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,10,Sam rockwell being a cool dancing hit man of hitmen what's not to love. One of the funniest thing iv see in a well.
" Adorable
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,9,There are some wonky parts to the plot/script and the wounds that appear and disappear throw you off but all in all it was a super fun and cute movie. The last scene is the best part.
" Decent killer parody
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,6,"The movie shows a woman (Anna Kendrick) with a boring life. After her boyfriend cheats on her, she loses it and falls into depression. Then she meets Mr. Right (Sam Rockwell), who seems to share a similar personality. You could call their characters weird and slightly crazy.What she doesn't know at first is, that Mr. Right is a professional killer. Besides their interactions and the love story that's filled with comedic moments, a former companion of Mr. Right (Tim Roth) and a wannabe gangster and his thugs try to kill the crazy hitman.The action in this movie is alright till good. It isn't overloaded with cuts and overall pleasently edited. It is fast paced and at some points quite violent, but still not overwhelming.The movie does not take itself seriously at all and the main source of entertainment comes from the comedy. The movie plays with typical gangster and agent movie cliches. And that is arguably the best part of the film. It shows scenes you never see in action movies and it also shows how awkward stuff can be. Sadly a lot of jokes do not work.The acting is decent, but not that outstanding, since the roles don't offer that much. Still nothing you would call bad or unconvincing.Pros:Decent actingA fun parody on action moviesA good humorGreat character dynamicCons:Flat storyJokes do not always workMight be a bit forgetableConclusion:It's definitely a fun movie to watch on a saturday evening. Overall it entertains and leaves you in a good mood. But it probably won't stay in your head for long.Rating: 68/100, 6/10"
" I like it.
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,6,A very gripping and entertaining film. I had a very enjoyable time watching.
" Kendrick & Rockwell work well
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,9,"A good movie that blends action and romantic comedy lines for a black comedic rebound love story.
The story line gets a little confusing around the start as to who's who, but ultimately pays off a surprising conclusion."
" Honestly surprising.
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,7,"I went into this expecting it to be a very mindless and laid back romcom. I was however; pleasantly surprised. Its quick paced, hillarious, well rounded and all around great. Highly recommended if you need a good laugh."
" Setting the record straight
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,8,"Disclaimer: I don't know how this thing was marketed. All the agro about a Tarantino derivation... don't know where that comes from but maybe some bad overmade studio trailer... anyway...Being funny is hard, right? Think about how many movies try and fail? Now let's wrap that into being funny while killing people? Like REALLY funny? They manage it here by layering ""workplace-comedy"" type dialogue on top of sweet, unconventional character types and rolling it up into some more than passable sexymatography. Everywhere a stereotype lurks, the film tweaks it's nipple and gives it some over the top charm. Shootuts in pouring rain are worthy of the matrix. It all bundles together to be very, very watchable."
" An underrated piece of art!
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,8,"I truly love this film and it is spectacular as well! All the actors' performance were brilliant, the concept and message of the film is quite innovative, fascinating, thought-provoking and inspiring for novels. Furthermore, the film is very humorous. This film is genuinely an underrated piece of art. Why is the rating so low and why are the stars so few. This film deserves at least a 7 out of 10 stars!To me, this is one of those few films that I would watch again and again, even though I'm not a fan of romance films."
" A fun movie
",2018-11-08 00:00:00,9,"What a more mismatched couple these are, but they were fun! Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick are not a match you would expect. She's slightly mad and he's, well, definitely mad! I loved how director Paco Cabezas focused on Sam's dance or fight moves. The soundtrack is great, it's lively and snappy. Tim Roth, my goodness, that accent is terrible! Great choreography throughout. You cannot take the cast in this movie seriously and nor should you so don't expect 007, expect a laugh and clever features it will not disappoint"
" Everyone likes to talk in this movie.
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,5,"Great cast, but every body just cannot stop talking. Too many unnecessary dialogues."
" Wasn't to bad
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,6,"This movie was good entertainment. If I had turned it on expecting some amazing movie...I would have been disappointed. But, all I was really looking for was something to watch that evening and thats what I got. It had some funny moments. Some of the action was kind of cheesy, but it is a rom com so what can you expect? I'm a fan of Sam Rockwell's so I was just happy to see a movie with him in it.  As far as the title goes, ""Mr. Right"", well he defineltly is Mr. Right for her. Anna Kendrick's character is completely bats*** crazy as it turns out in this movie. But they kind of make out to be this cute murdery couple.  Overall, if you are looking for a masterpiece, i'd steer clear. If you want some entertainment for an evening, then i'd say go for it, you might like it."
" Fun little movie with lots of humor
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,7,"Typical boy meets girl, girl discovers boy is hit man who's gone to the good side. Plenty of violence with gunmen who can't hit the side of a barn, while good boy hits everything he shoots, stabs, or punches at. Bad guys often get killed in comical ways. Rated at 7 stars because not once did I want to get up out of my chair until the movie was over. Enjoyable time waster!"
" Holy Crap I Love This Movie
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,10,"I ran across this on OnDemand one night and was absolutely delighted throughout. Anna Kendrick is charming as Martha, a down-on-her-luck quirky girl (but not silly quirky ala Garden State, etc). Sam Rockwell (and I'll admit some bias here because he is my favorite) is edgy, sexy and his character is so very interesting. The best thing about this film is the chemistry between the two, which is bananas. The action gets a little out of hand, and it's pretty violent, but overall really fun and refreshing. RZA was a nice touch, and it was good to see Tim Roth, though he gave quite a nod to his character in Reservoir Dogs. Anson Mount was barely tolerable, as usual, but it worked. That's the thing about this film. It works on so many levels that the places that could be better really don't matter. If you want a fun, funny, romantic, action-filled delight of a little film, check it out."
" SOMETIMES THINGS JUST WORK
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,10,"Sometimes you find a movie by accident and am so glad you did and Mr Right is just that movie.The plot is simple and fun. Not wanting to give away too much ""A Girl unlucky in love finally meets Mr Right who just happens to be a hit man"" This whole movie revolves around the chemistry between Sam Rockwell's 'Fancis' and Anna Kendrick's 'Martha' and they have it in spades it is a pleasure to watch them together on screen and they make such a great and beliveable couple that it carries the rest of the movie along in their wake. From the minute that they meet you want them to succeed and without that this movie wouldn't work.Both leads take characters that could all to easily be unlikable and annoying and make them people that you would like to meet and spend time with. Rockwell is a treat to watch in this role as he dances and kills all along making light hearted banter much to the confusion and chagrin of his opponents. He makes the character likeable and believable and Kendrick what a standout performance she makes you like and care about 'Martha' a character walking the tightrope between crazy and manic, and Cute and lovable like a master, in the wrong hands this character would be annoying and grating .The action scenes are well choreographed and and fun keeping it light and fast never going to far but just far enough with the blood and gore.Rounding out the main characters is Tim Roth who is a perfect counterpoint to Rockwell and Kendrick. He is the perfect bad for the film you don't want him to succeed but you also sort of like him.All I can say is sit back, put your feet up and enjoy yourself."
" Needed a shower after this one
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,5,"Very strange film. I'm a huge Sam Rockwell fan - and although I always enjoy his cool dancey schtik, I couldn't dig the overall feel / plot of this flick. The attitude towards violence & killing people made me feel uncomfortable. Especially the glee & respect a certain character gets when they make their first kill. Throwing knives and catching knives, not a great idea for kids to see, if a kid happened to catch this movie. And what was Rza from WuTang doing in this movie? His character was pretty lame & could've been played by any generic actor. Why did he take this particular role? For a much better & way funnier Sam Rockwell film, try Welcome to Collinwood or Matchstick amen. For a much better hitman goes dating movie, try Grosse Pointe Blank."
" Recommended to friends
",2018-08-14 00:00:00,10,This is one of the movies I urge people to take a look at. Both Anna Kendrick and Sam Rockwell are just great comic actors in this movie. Just a joy from beginning to end.
" Great fun movie with loads of good actors
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,9,"This is a wonderful film with all you need for an entertaining dark comedy. Brilliantly acted by Anna, Sam and Tim as the main characters and a script that keeps you riveted all the way. Wonderful fun highly recommended. Also see ""Happy Death Day"" and the ""Accountant"" for a more serious but still entertaining film."
" Really weird but really fun.
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,8,"MORE REVIEWS AT booksequalhappiness.blogspot.comREVIEW: I honestly liked this movie. There was nothing much to the story but it was fun and entertaining to watch. Anna Kendrick was able to showcase her funny and weird personality here. The main issue I had was with the instant-love that happened with Martha and Francis. Still, they were fun to watch. Also, the cinematography was beautiful and the choreography they had for the fights was great considering that it's not really an action film.SHOULD YOU WATCH IT: Yes, if you want something simple and fun.
WOULD I WATCH IT AGAIN: Yes (Already watched this 2x)."
" Quirky Comedy With Some Morals
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,10,I love this movie! It's a light-hearted comedy with some fun twists on common moral dilemmas that add to make up a fun movie that I could watch many times.
" Great movie
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,10,"I loved it, such a great movie.The humor is great and the fighting scenes are amazingly cool. Funny characters, I have always been a fan of the moments in silly action movies with a chase and they run into an elevator and they just stand there staring into the air and waiting for the elevator to stop, and back to chasing. There isn't such a scene but there are many alike, and it adds to the comedy part of the movie."
" I have really enjoyed this movie!
",2018-04-04 00:00:00,9,I love Sam Rockwell and Anna Kendrick and to see that they have really great chemistry together in this absurd romantic comedy gave me joy! I think this is how romantic comedies should be! With its right amount of action and romance this movie was perfect!
" A pleasant suprise
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,10,"I honestly had no interest in watching this movie, I'm not a massive fan of Anna Kendrick as it is BUT I gave it a go as I had ZERO else to watch; Boy, Was I wrong! This movie was a great watch! Sam Rockwell was a pure delight to watch as ""Mr Right"" he fitted the character perfectly! He's like the lovable rouge throughout it, but a more funnier version?! I loved the whole quirky relationship between Anna & himself, I honestly don't think the director and cast members could have picked a better duo for this movie! They mashed so well together! If you have any doubts then wipe them clean off because you really won't be disappointed! From start to finish this movie keeps you on your toes! Great action mixed with comedy & romance. Thoroughly enjoyed it! Don't miss out on the fun!"
" Best movie ever
",2018-03-14 00:00:00,10,If there was ever a movie about relationship goals this is it. My favorite movie ever!!!!!!
" Very funny
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,9,"Okay, it's not a perfect movie. But I laughed out loud, in the theatre. I spit Pepsi out my nose. At the end of the day, isn't that why you go to a comedy? As a bonus, I also liked the characters - Sam Rockwell is always pretty great, and he manages to be a psychokiller that you love and root for in this one. And Anna Kendrick can do no wrong, in this film, or any other. This is just an enjoyable romp, well worth watching."
" Two Nuts Having Fun
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,8,"Mr. Douche.Cute closet scene with a sneaky closing line.Highly excitable people with guns is not a good foreshadow.Her skirt matches his shirt? Maybe not. I'm not fashionista.Ya gotta laugh at work.Someone's gonna walk in and freak out.

" Just good fun
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,10,"I accidentally found this movie on a plane, and the flight was just under being long enough and sought out to rewatch from the start as it captured me! I really liked this movie, I like it so much I literally created a log in to say so. My review isnt funny, witty or relevant in any way but I feel like this movie is something you should give a go as you might find yourself laughing and bopping along!The sound track is so up beat and the characters are wacky but enjoyable. I sometimes play this movie in the background while I'm pottering around just because it makes me happy! Although I think the two leads are the oddest couple ever, somehow they make it work. Overal all, super enjoyable and perky. Please just watch it"
" Sam Rockwell had a well written and interesting character...Anna Kendrick was not so lucky.
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,3,"He's honest about killing--she thinks he's kidding
at times, writing seemed dumb--such as with her laughing
some dialog is surreal and funny--hers isn't
her powers are dumbMartha (Anna Kendrick) has just broken up with her boyfriend after catching him cheating on her. Now she's on the rebound and stumbles upon a really neat guy--he's sweet, he's thoughtful and he is adorable. Unfortunately, Francis (Sam Rockwell) is an assassin who's taken to killing his clients. After all, they want someone murdered so he feels no problem in just killing them instead. But what will Martha do when she discovers that Mr. Right is not quite as perfect as she'd hoped?Sam Rockwell's character is cleverly written and the dialog is nice. Unfortunately, Kendrick's character is pretty stupid, unconvincing and stupid. Yes, I said stupid twice...and her badly written character was simply annoying and awful."
" Hm, What Was That?
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,2,"People will tell me, Come on, this is just a movie, this is a joke, and take it easy. Well, I can't. This is the movie which steadfastily drills an idea into watchers' minds that being a hitman is fun and can be cute. I cannpt buy this. Nor can I agree with usually great Sam Rockwell, as well as super sute Anna Kendrick or Tim Roth's parts. I felt more like a deep shame or a terrible uneasiness than fun or giddiness. 
I am sorry, I cannot buy this concept, nor am I more thrilled with endless F-bombs or endless gore, blood and violence. Hey, I could have, had the message of the movie been different. Here, it goes on praising a murderous, bloody and merciless lifestyle. I can't get that. I feel like three great talents are wasted here and the whole movie is a huge unnecessary joke."
" never expected to like this
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,10,"The most unexpected quirky charming tale, with lots of action and so funny! I had watched it twice and then started showing it to others. one person didnt like it and didnt get it, but everyone else loved it too. so watch it, superb acting and clever writing. yay for everyone who worked on the movie \\ has cult gem tattooed all over this lol"
" Unexpectedly hilarious!
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,10,"It's weird to say, but this movie made me so happy. It is by far my favorite Anna Kendrick roll. She was so quirky and endearing at the same time. Can't believe it doesn't have a higher rating. I've never reviewed a film before, but I enjoyed it so much, I felt compared to share."
" Great romantic comedy (with blood)
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,10,"I never heard of this movie before I saw it coming up on Cinemax. Now I am glad that I watched it. It is a really fun and funny movie. The sense of humor is very dark, but the characters are so cool. I just finished it, and the leads have great chemistry, and the story really moves along. Sam Rockwell's Mr. Right (don't call him Francis!) has fun being a hired killer who kills those who hire him, dancing while he is shooting and killing people, while wearing a clown nose. And Anna Kendrick plays a really quirky girl who really gets into her man's lifestyle, once she realizes he is not joking about being a hit man. And he never lies to her, so she has been hearing the truth from the beginning. Their relationship flows naturally, and the way he teaches her a new and deadly skill excites her as it would in real life. I mean, one way to make a woman feel close to you is to teach her a new skill, and it really does work like this. Anyway, I wish I was in a relationship like theirs, it would be so much fun killing bad guys...heh, heh, heh.November 12, 2017--I just watched it again. And it is still Hi-Larious! Still very enjoyable. And cute little Anna Kendrick really becomes a compatible partner for her man. Why does nobody listen to her...or believe her when she says she is going to kill them? What a fun story! I really need to get the DVD so I can erase it from my DVR!"
" Highly Underrated Action RomCom
",2017-09-28 00:00:00,7,"It's the classic ""girl meets boy, girl falls for boy.."" kind of film; a basic paint-by-numbers Action Romantic Comedy, with telegraphed movie beats. However with Max Landis' quirky writing style injected into it, it becomes more than just the sum of its parts.It's funny, quirky, and action packed.Sam Rockwell (Mr. Right), Anna Kendrick (Martha), Tim Roth (Hopper) and RZA (Shotgun Steve) are the real standouts for me in this outing. And who knew RZA was so *censored* funny!?Speaking of Rockwell and Kendrick, their on-screen chemistry is almost palpable, and for that reason alone you should watch this movie. If you liked ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" and ""Grosse Pointe Blank"", you'll enjoy this cinematic experience as much as I did."
" stupid
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,5,"This movie doesn't really deserve more than a one-word review, but here goes. Action-romance-comedy do not go together. The last attempt I saw, ""This Means War,"" didn't work, either. Rom-com works, action-romance works, and action-comedy works, but stuffing all three into a single film is too ambitious.Anna Kendrick is fine but I cringed at the lines she had to deliver. Flat and dull.Some people noted that this type of comedy is off-beat and not for everyone. Well, I've been called ""weird"" my entire life and I like different and unusual stuff. This one is just unfunny. Bad dialogue, bad script, bad idea."
" pretty funny black comedy
",2017-08-30 00:00:00,6,"I guess this was an independent film, since boxofficemojo.com says it grossed $34,000. Is that correct?Martha (Anna Kendrick) is waiting for her boyfriend when he enters the house, passionately kissing another woman and throwing her on a table. Devastated by her breakup, Martha laments meeting Mr. Right. But she does meet him - an attractive guy (Sam Rockwell) with a great sense of humor who seems really into her. Both are smitten.This new guy (we find out later his name is Francis) tells her he's a hit-man, he just killed someone, etc., all of which she finds terribly funny. Until she actually sees him shoot someone. He can't understand why she's upset. He really doesn't want to kill any longer, so what he's been doing is killing the people that hire him, not the actual victims. Martha's a little upset. Also, it seems that a cartel Francis worked for, led by a man named Hopper (Tim Roth), is after him. So he's not actually Reynolds, the FBI guy she thinks he is.Funny comedy that is also surprisingly violent and has some great choreographed fight scenes. Tim Roth as the FBI guy has a southern accent but reverts to his usual British as Hopper. I've been watching him on ""Lie to Me,"" and he's playing a similar out-there character.I loved Katie Nehra as Martha's friend Sophie, and the bad guys are funny too - James Ransone, Anson Mount, Michael Eklund, and RZA as a not-so-bad guy.Entertaining."
" Perfect Date Night Movie
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,8,"This is not your typical boy meets girl. In this film, the girl is one of questionable psychological stability, and the boy is a self actualizing gun-for-hire with brain damage... But hey, when you know, you know. The psychotic quirkiness of the characters makes for some highly entertaining television, and no action was sacrificed for the sake of the underlying romantic theme. A fun film with a little something for everybody."
" Funny movie, not to be taken too seriously
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,9,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. At first I was kinda grossed out because the lead man is way older than the lead woman, but it kind of fits the relationship as it progresses. All the actors are great picks and do a really good job, especially Anna Kendrick, Sam Rockwell and Tim Roth. Both lead characters are obviously kind of crazy and it's fine, and it works well! I really enjoyed this movie."
" Didn't think I'd like this that much...
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,9,"I don't do many reviews... but this one I felt deserved it. I was sitting here in my chair and found this on the Netflix list. I noticed it because Anna Kendrick is in it and I luuv her. I'd never imagine it being this entertaining tho... I kind of expected some soapy chick flick and got the opposite... yay !Sam Rockwell is awesome in it and as a bonus we've got Tim Roth who's amazing in everything. It's funny, it's violent ... and sometimes funny violent. It got moves, it got character and the chemistry between Anna and Sam is great.It's one of those movies that I'll end up watching many times. I love movies like this and I would even go as long as saying I'd love a sequel. This movie is Lucky number Slevin Replacement killer awesome."
" Worst movie I've seen so far this year (2017)
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,1,"OK, so it's a movie from 2015, but I was looking around for something to watch, and came across this movie.""Sure,"" I thought, ""What's not to like? It has Sam Rockwell (a genius in other movies), Tim Roth (ditto) and Anna Kendrick."" Later I found out that Anson Mount from Hell on Wheels is also in it! I felt bad for each and every one of them while watching this piece of garbage. I know they're getting paid well, but to have to try and act out these lines that are completely ridiculous and an insult to the intelligence of any poor sucker who actually paid for this movie, well, it must have been difficult. I hope they got paid well and the idiots who wrote and produced this movie lost their shirts.I'm a huge fan of good movies and TV shows. I appreciate quality acting, smart direction and above all, compelling writing. This movie had none of these qualities. Avoid at all costs.At least I didn't pay for it. I just wish I hadn't wasted the time to see it."
" A very pleasant surprise
",2017-07-07 00:00:00,9,A really endearing thrill-ride of an action romantic comedy. Could have been an awful film if not for the perfect casting. I wasn't expecting much but I was smiling all the way through. Chimes with the millennial quarter-life crisis epidemic.Enjoy this film on a rough day/hangover.
" Gross Pointe Right
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,5,"Mr.Right is a quirky, breezy romantic comedy with action scenes. After a painful breakup Anna Kendrick finds her perfect guy, Sam Rockwell who dances his way through her heart. The trouble is he is a hit-man who wants to go straight but his handlers do not want to let him go and he is pursued by Tim Roth.The film is not that original with shades of Gross Pointe Blank but it is not as good as that film."
" great film
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,10,"I loved it,it was hilarious and fun to watch it was so good I laughed several times;but I love every Anna Kendrick film It was too good to end I can't wait for mr.right 2 Anna Kendrick was extremely Fun to watch,I've watched it Like 5 times and it gets Better each time,great romcom Which was more com than rom Loved it loved it Loved it Loved it loved it Loved it Loved it loved it Loved it Loved it loved it Loved it"
" Gory entertainment
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,8,"This movie has no message, no deep meaning, no pretensions at all. It is simple entertainment, with a few wry plot twists to keep you guessing and a really wonderful cast of characters. To start with, Anna Kendrick's character Martha is just eccentric enough when she first appears that you can easily imagine her zaniness turning cheerfully violent in the end. And indeed it does. Martha is the sort of person who, bound and gagged, can't stifle her giggles at the absurdly macho kidnappers she's about to kill.Sam Rockwell, as a practically invincible hit man, somehow senses that Martha shares his superpower (for lack of a better word) and opens the door to it for her just enough to enable her to join him. He is in fact her Mr Right, and she is his perfect match."
" This movie is a lot of fun.
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,8,It is mostly about the nutty chemistry of the two leads. I mean the plot is somewhere in the background and more of an excuse for Sam and Anna to do ridiculously implausible stuff that is actually enjoyably escapist. Again there is nothing profound about this movie. It is just mindlessly entertaining.
" Hilarious
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,10,"My husband and I stop whatever we are doing and watch this movie when it comes on. The writing is sharp and witty. All the actors do such a great job (Love watching Sam and Anna together - there's a spark!) I can't believe this movie hasn't gotten more buzz. We quote this show all the time ""I'm a T Rex"" ""Yah, we met at the office"". I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a funny, quirky movie, to just laugh and be silly with. Oh, yah there is the killing stuff, but that can be funny, right?"
" Great off-the-wall comedy
",2017-05-05 00:00:00,8,"Not what you will expect, but a well written and funny comedy with the wonderful Mr Rockwell. This initially got quite a low IMDb rating, but I think a classic case of the wrong people expecting something they shouldn't. For fans of something a little different from the big budget comedy\crime genre, an entertaining and well presented film that delivers well above its humble rating, what more could you ask for?Do yourself a favor, watch it."
" If you want to really laugh
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,9,"My problem with most comedies is that they do not make me laugh. Most of them are stupid, unoriginal and shallow, simply bad movies. But even the good ones rarely cause the wanted effect. I'm watching and I'm aware that what I'm watching is funny, but I'm not laughing. This is one of the few that made me really laugh, often, loudly and even to tears on a few occasions.9/10"
" Greatest Movie Ever
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,10,"Honestly, Its so great. Just so good, 20/10. Grab some snacks and some friends and watch this. You'll laugh for days. Its really funny, Anna Kendrick is perfect perfect for this role. Her relationship is something else of its own, they somehow work perfectly together. Probably because they are both psychopaths, Annas character twist is just surprising and yet not. I'd watch this a million and one times over."
" Shallow and disappointing
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,4,"Its a real pity to see such great actors try and pull this terrible piece of script writing together. The characters (and they are LEGION) have all of the depth of the piece of paper their trite lines are written on. Anna Kendricks character in particular is lacking completely in motivation or explanation, but she is not alone. I could practically feel the actors strain to bring some sense of reality to their roles. The story is slapped together and fairly directionless. Who are these people? We barely understand what anyone is doing anywhere. The concept is a good one and God knows, I love Sam Rockwell, which just made this film all the more disappointing."
" Mr. Right was Played by Mrs. Wrong
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,5,"I did not want to see the movie, but I love Ana Kenderick and the awesome Sam Rockwell. I think they are talented but the movie was really let down by Ana Kenderick.Rockwell is a Hit-man and ends up having a heart. He meets Ana and then goes on dates with her before she finds out. But the movie was not all that bad, but Ana was so unfit for her role. She does her usual awkward lines but it felt the movie would have been much better if an older, stronger actress was used for the humor and lines.Rockwell was excellent, but he was not enough to really save the movie imo. Movie is watchable but forgettable."
