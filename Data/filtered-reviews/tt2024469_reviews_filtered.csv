" One of the best hijacking films, and one of the very good ones of Liam Neeson. Intelligent plot, great acting, lots of suspense!
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,8,"Hijacking movie. One of the best hijacking films and one of Liam Neeson's very good ones. Neeson, a federal police officer in charge of international flight safety, begins receiving in-flight messages from an anonymous terrorist that if they don't give him $150 million, he'll start killing one passenger every 20 minutes. Neeson is desperately trying to track down who he is, while several of the other passengers are beginning to believe that he is hijacking himself and this information is also leaked out of the plane. The real hijackers had it all planned it in detail to blame Neeson for that. A unique hijacking thriller, with excellent performances and plenty of suspense throughout the film without tiring at all. Excellent work overall. It's recommended to everyone."
" 7/10
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,7,NonStop is a decent thriller kinda wish they explained how people randomly die in this film all around is it pretty slow more problems come through out the second half which made it pretty overwhelming
" Action-packed, well-acted mystery with satisfying developments
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,9,"I'm a little biased, as this movie has a lot that I fall for; an alcoholic lead, multiple characters with secrets, Julianne Moore, workplace action/suspense/violence, and a contained and limited cast of potential culprits. So, from the premise alone, I was in for everything this movie threw at me.
I found it well-acted, and the developments were realistic (in a world where incredibly well-planned and well-organized terrorists can exist.)
I overall found it worth the watch."
" For Liam Neeson Fans
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,7,Not a bad movie. I think I enjoyed this more as Liam is one of my favourite actors. Definitely not Taken standard but comes close.
" Edge of the seat Thriller!
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,9,"This movie keeps you hooked till the end. The first thought that came to my mind after finishing this movie was, 'This movie is best enjoyed on a big screen'. All Liam Neeson fans would be overjoyed after watching this one. Watch it out guys, you won't regret."
" Watch Something Else !
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,4,"I watched this film during a down-time and couldn't really get into it. I found it boring and uninteresting, but the premise of this 2014 film follows a Federal Air Marshall named Bill Marks, marvellously played by Liam Neeson, who must locate a killer on his international flight after he receives texts that say someone on board will be killed every 20 minutes until financial demands are met. It seems a little far fetched, especially all the security you have to go through in an airport. Liam Neeson's character elevates, what I think is forgettable material, as this film doesn't hurt that Julianne Moore's in the cast, too, playing a gal named Jen Summers, so it really feels like putting those two amazing actors together are just slumming it. If you watch carefully, these characters give the movie their all, as everyone pales in comparison. It's so maddening, that the film does an extreme job at heightening the tension. I feel that this plane is hurtling NON-STOP at an enormous pace, but barely makes it to the gate with momentum intact. Did I like this film? Not really and apart from Moore and Neeson working together, it sucked, actually, so sucked that Neeson has been quoted recently that he has retired from making action movies, which means we won't get a promised 'Taken 4'. Sooo sad."
" Hugely intense thriller. If you haven't seen it, go see it.
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,8,"This is one reason why I always catch Liam Neeson's action films at some point. Cause they always keep you hooked so you get their point. This time he's playing a federal air marshal who also has to save a plane that is being hijacked by one of the passengers threatening to kill somebody every 20 minutes unless he gets 150 million dollars wired to his account. If that doesn't get you pumped, then I don't know what will cause this is exciting as movies get. It's very good but this movie could have been better but 8 for me for the performances and very well organized. Doesn't jump around and always stays focused on the main guy. Liam Neeson is at the top of his game and stays true to the game."
" Goofs
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,2,"Just before the plane lands with the rear on fire as well as an engine, you hear an announcement that fuel is being dumped. Bad decision!!"
" Thrilling, claustrophobic and great action
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,8,"What a great movie this is. Neeson is perfect for the role as an alcoholic, troubled airmarshall and Moore is great as the humane and caring passenger. The story unfolds with a certain credibility and grips the viewer from the moment you learn that something is wrong. The plot is satisfying, the rest of the cast is good as well and Neeson just oozes the charisma of an unwilling hero. Suspenseful and with good action."
" Much better than it should have been...
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,7,"I'll admit I had low expectations, I thought it was going to be another dumb action film set on a plane. But this was genuinely very good, original story and twists, and gripped me until the end. There were some dumb moments for sure, but on balance, well worth 105 minutes of your time."
" Frustrating second half
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,6,"I really really liked the first half of ""Non-Stop"" because it was an interesting thriller with a lot of twists and turns that weren't very predictable. I've casually start watching it and I was impressed. Then the second half kicked in. In contrast with the unpredictable first half everything becomes more uninspired and dull. But the worst part is the finale itself: rushed and plot braking. Indeed the motivations of the characters are trivial in some cases, non-sense in others and the most important one is incomprehensible because the writer/s didn't know how to handle it and they choose to make a character say fast multiple words in a Eminem fashion so that the viewers maybe didn't notice that those words made no sense as a cohesive speech. For these reasons if the first half the movie was a solid 8, it became only a 6/6.5 after that second half. It's a pity because with a little more attention to the plot and the finale (that felt like suddenly cut) it could have been a very good thriller."
" Seat edge thriller
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,8,"Believe me, this movie is awesome and if you like action thriller or seat edge thriller then you will love this movie."
" Nonsense Stupid Good Movie
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,6,"No scenerio at all. If I were Liam Neeson I don't want to play on this movie. Full of plot holes. Everything based on impossible actions. No intelligent story writing at all.
But fun to watch."
" It was unusually boring for a hijacking.
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,4,"How did the killer get access to our hero's cell phone? How did the captain of the plane die? If he is sure somebody sent the text message, why didn't he ask? 'Didn't the person next to you use the cellphone five minutes ago?'
I was expecting a very interesting mystery at the end, but I'm disappointed. I felt that the criminal was found out suddenly and in a very conventional way.
I couldn't understand the motive of the murderer at all. In fact, I didn't understand what he was saying. I'm surprised they didn't duel in the planning stages.
If they're going to make a movie like this, they should have at least think up an interesting way of how the captain was killed. I thought he was going to kill himself. The first one was also too well timed, as advertised, so suicide was the only way to go, right? I thought they were all involved who got deaths. There's a lot of interesting hints in advance and then it doesn't end up satisfactory. It's like a con."
" Enjoyable
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,9,"If you are a fan of the movie Air Force One, then you will enjoy this movie. It's something different, and it works well. A guess who / who dunnit movie where it keeps you glued to the screen, guessing each time.Well worth the watch."
" Action packed
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,9,"I needed a distraction from 'stuff' going on. This was the 4th film I tried. The others didn't get past the first 5 minutes. Anyway, this was just the thing. Right from the first scene, I was hooked and really enjoyed the story. It was great to see 'Lady Mary' in a film so different from her Downton Abbey character. Yes, some scenes were a little mushy and some plot lines a little dubious ( getting to the captain's head via a hole in the towel dispenser? Really?) But that aside, it kept me guessing. Thoroughly enjoyed this. Give it a try."
" Had more potential
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,6,Suspense in this movie was good. You can't figure out who is the person messaging from other end. But this film had more potential. The main problem with the film according to me was it's climax. The reason given by bad person looked silly to me. The acting was also not upto the mark and at one point films looks unnecessarily stretched. These were the problems I saw in this movie.
" I HAVE NEVER FELT SO COMPELLED TO REVIEW SUCH A POOR FILM
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,1,"I have never reviewed a film in my entire life. I created an IMDB account SPECIFICALLY to review this film. It was so bad it had me laughing with tears in my eyes. I honestly cannot fathom how anyone could think this film was good. The script / acting / plot is all hot garbage. Some lines in this film were so diabolical I almost threw my TV out of the window. It is the most unrealistic, ridiculously far-fetched and frankly atrocious film I have ever seen. It is worse than Human Centipede. I would honestly rather you spend the 1 hour 45 mins I wasted watching this film doing literally anything else e.g watching paint dry or standing in a freezer."
" Up in the air
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,8,"Doesn't matter whether Liam Neeson is in America or France, saving is son or daughter, or on the ground or in the air he still manages to deliver a good action film. This has a really good story and suspense all the way through until you find out who it is causing the problems."
" Feels too familiar.
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,5,"There are a few original ideas in this, but it just feels like many other films set on a plane. I also feel like Liam Neeson is beginning to be pigeon holed as the guy to avoid travelling with regardless of the vehicle. Bottom line, the film cost $50M to make and earned half that back in one weekend in the U.S. Who cares what I think? :)"
" A gripping and entertaining thriller, but it struggles to be credible
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,7,"Non-Stop features a gripping story that kept me interested from the beginning to the end. Additionally, it turned out to be a fairly entertaining movie. On the other hand, it chronically struggles when it comes to being believable, even though it does offer relatively plausible explanations for some of the events that seem to be illogical and impossible when they first pop up on the screen.The eventual crash landing makes for a predictable finale and turns out to be more theatrical than realistic as far as its visual appearance is concerned. Although winning some points in terms of coming as something of a surprise, the preceding sequence in which the two villains expose themselves happens to be more comical than harrowing, especially in relation to the character named Zack and the way he takes off his shirt and tie to reveal tattoos on his muscular arms and a stereotypical commando outfit consisting of a black sleeveless top.There were several other clichéd characters and opinions throughout the film, even though some of them appeared to have been depicted in a vaguely satirical manner. Equally, Liam Neeson plays the kind of law enforcement officer that one gets to encounter in hundreds of works of fiction - weary, stubborn, traumatized and unable to calm himself down unless he has a couple of drinks. Still, he manages to deliver a convincing performance and the remaining members of the movie's ensemble are just as successful in playing their parts."
" Totally silly, but you'll keep watching
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,7,"This film has zero plausibility. However, it's so well done, and Liam Neeson is so good, you'll watch it to the end.It's a nerve-wracking thriller popcorn movie, abundant with Hollywood silliness. But you'll get your money's worth."
" Tense and involving, but full of problems.
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,5,"This action film is based on a threat against an airplane where an air marshall, in charge of protecting it, is traveling. It is very similar to many other terrorist and hijacker films, but it still does reasonably well.Liam Neeson is an excellent actor and has a knack for action or thriller films. It is his strength as an actor and he makes this film with ease. The character did not bring any kind of challenge to the actor, and he supports the entire film on his back very well. Julianne Moore also appears, but has had very little to do other than get on the plane and have some more tense dialogues with Neeson. The same can be said of Linus Roache, Michelle Dockery and especially Lupita Nyong'o, who is demoted to a cameo.Tense and involving, the film still manages to create an environment and build around it. Cinematography is very good and collaborates very well for this purpose, as do the rare but effective special and sound effects. The soundtrack is effective, but I confess that it was not in my ear. The end of the film was criticized at times, but I think it was not possible to do it any other way. However, it could have been rethought in several places where it sounds quite bad, such as dialogues and some situations: for example, how would it be possible for an airplane in such a situation to land at an airport that not even foam placed on the runway?Despite having several flaws and losing qualities as it unfolds, it is a film that still proved capable of entertaining and involving most of the time."
" SOME THRILLS, SOME BAD LAUGHS, SOME TOUCHING MOMENTS
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,5,"The stupid moments drag it down. The development process felt rushed.
As the cable guide said, two stars.
There are some suspenseful moments and some mystery elements that work well.
It's OK if you got nothing better to do. A few nice twists.
Good acting. As usual, Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore are both good. She has more to work with here.
Not as good as ""Executive Decision,"" which is much smarter."
" A GREAT ENTERTAINING MYSTERY THRILLER
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,8,"Liam Neeson is an action legend in his own right & has made some of the most entertaining Action Thriller's of the about the last ten years, we've had Neeson vs wolves in the snowy wilderness survival Thriller The Grey & we've had his iconic kidnap & revenge Taken Trilogy & his memory loss Mystery with Unknown & his troubled grizzled Detective Crime Thriller, A Walk Among The Tombstones & his Survive the night chase Thriller, Run All Night, all excellent Neeson flicks. So it's definitely safe to say that Neeson is an action Hero legend just a later in life ageing action hero but already he's one of the greats in my opinion & i just totally enjoy his films as he takes out plenty of villains & saves the day, he makes high class slick, big budget action Thriller's that are a perfect night time watch as a ""Popcorn"" flick.Non-stop is a smart & stylish suspenseful Murder Mystery Thriller with some good action scenes but it's mainly in the Thriller genre just like Neesons other Mystery Thriller flick ""Unknown"" with the same Director (Jaume Collet-Serra) who obviously has a great working relationship with the ageing action star as they've made so far four films together with Unknown, Non-stop, Run All Night & The Commuter.
Here Neeson plays another troubled & rugged type of character with a very sad backstory as an Air Marshall named Bill Mark who gets thrown right into a deadly mystery aboard his flight with a terrorist messaging him about a passenger with die every twenty minutes if his demands are not met. Neeson does give such a good paranoid & frustrated performance & has created one of his best characters in my opinion.The suspense is high & very claustrophobic as our hero is stuck on the plane wondering up & down the aisles & looking at the passenger's wondering who it is.
I liked the quiet & lonely night time atmosphere. This is a smart Mystery & an exciting one too & it has a nice night time feel to it & a slick look & a great supporting cast with an excellent Julianne Moore in a good solid role here with some nice character depth & back story as Jen, a passenger who helps our hero & we have an off duty New York Cop named Austin played by Corey Stoll & he's a good character here too & there's also solid performances from Scoot McNairy, Nate Parker, Michelle Dokery & Lupita Nyong'O.
Non-stop is a fun popcorn Thriller that keeps you guessing & wondering who is doing this & why? How many terrorists? It's a clever story & also frustrating as Neeson's Character is constantly being look at as the terrorist himself as things keep happening & pointing directly at him by the clever terrorist.
Just an enjoyable Neeson thriller & he's so good at them."
" Mafia the Movie
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"When it comes to action, this film really lives up to its title. The action is indeed non-stop. While the film is not without flaws and plotholes, it's got enough spirit and thrill to make up for it. (However, there is one genuinely sweet moment that was unnecessarily turned into a comic relief moment) I came in with my expectations high and left thinking the film was better than I thought it would be. Just imagine how much better this would have been if I had come in with my expectations low. There's twists and turns at every moment, some details that you have to really have to pay attention to the film to notice, (and you will be rewarded for doing so) and some bait-and-switch moments that will surprise you. The whole film feels like a game of mafia set on an airplane. A game in which the audience is constantly fooled. You will not be dissapointed if you see this film.
Grade: A- 9/10 4.5/5 stars"
" Waisted my time
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,4,"Not believable at all! The whole movie is Liam Neeson running around the plane doing stuff that nobody in their right mind would do in that situation. I do not understand why does this movie have a high score, it's average at best."
" Exhilarating
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,8,"Thriller, action, suspense, mystery.
You never really know what's going on.
It's crazy and amazing at the same time."
" ""Non-Stop"" thrilling entertainer
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,8,"Non-Stop is a claustrophobic, thrilling and entertaining time. The premise and such is quite familiar but you'll probably have a good time. Excellent script that keeps you guessing and trying to figure out ""whodun it."" And Liam Neeson, boy, what to say of him.... His action flicks have been on an upward trend since ""Taken"" & none of his actions thrillers have let me down since then. Here too he does a great job and definitely kicks ass as usual. He keeps you rooting for him the entire film. He gets a great supporting cast as well. There was not one moment in this film that I was bored, and it was filled to the brim with twists, and turns. Overall, this movie is a great thriller without being packed full of action."
" Non-Stop
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,8,"When I first saw previews for this I called it ""Taken Plane."" After seeing it, it is everything but that. Excellent script that keeps you guessing and trying to figure out ""who dun it."" Liam Neeson does a great job and keeps you rooting for him the entire film. He gets a great supporting cast as well. Top notch performance by Corey Stoll as the NYPD detective passenger on the plane as well. The only downside to this film was that when the film started it almost seemed like the first 2-4 minutes were cut and just dropped you right into the film. A little confusing but nothing extreme to take away from the rest of the film."
" Non-Stop action
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,6,Another decent Liam Neeson action movie worth checking out. This time he is on a plane kicking ass.
" outstanding action
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,8,"Liam Neeson shines as an alcoholic marshall who gets a text on an airplane saying a passenger will be killed every 20 minutes if demands aren't met. He is also set up in the news to look like the bad guy, and non stop action ensues as he looks for the bad guy and a bomb on board.If you are into movies like this, you might like it. The performances, characterizations, and action sequences are all great. I like Neeson and his character. The cast meshes perfectly! Just suspend belief and you will have a great ride.*** out of ****"
" So bad, it's good
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,5,"This film is so preposterous, has so many plot holes, so many cliches, so many bad accents, so many technological impossibilities, so many bad things that it actually is enjoyable, but not for the reasons the makers intended."
" Suspense And Action Blended Well
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,7,"I saw this movie for the first time a few years back, I remembered it being a pretty interesting action movie so I went back to it to see if it held up and it totally does. The movie follows Bill, an air marshal, as he starts receiving texts from a terrorist. The movie does its best to try and present many suspects so that you don't have a clear guess. I feel it does it's job well enough, Liam Neeson does a good job, and although I feel Julianna is a bit wasted she gets a convincing performance in there. Overall, Non-Stop is an exciting and suspenseful action thriller. With a unique and interesting setting. 6.5/10."
" Its a 7 but I gave it an 8 so we could bring it to 7.0
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,8,Just watched it for the 3rd or 4th time . Has some small cliches that I as a director and screenwriter noticed but the movie managed to make a true cinematic expirience . Myb not a masterpiece or a classic that I prefer but its a good action money that keeps its viewers going and wanting to find the real terrorists ...
" Don't get impatient
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,7,This movie started really slow. I nearly gave up but once mystery is introduced you can't stop watching.
" Totally stupid
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,1,"Makes no sense whatsoever. Crap plot. Even the actors are stupid, what's the point in it."
" Absolutely no logic, but...
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,5,It's still quite thrilling to watch. You just have to make sure that you go in prepared for the absolute nonsense of reasoning and actions that go on through the entire movie. If you can get past that. You'll enjoy it. Sort of.
" Non-stop
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,7,"A non stop thrill ride from the beginning to end. Liam Neeson as usual in his style pulls off the impossible and makes a satisfying thriller. The director pulled off his usual twisted thriller like his earlier ""Unknown (2011)""."
" Smart, suspenseful plot, with good acting performances. I just kept guessing what would happen next. Real edge of your seat kinda story. Very enjoyable watch.
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,8,"Smart, suspenseful plot, with good acting performances by Liam Neeson AND supporting actors. I just kept guessing what would happen next. Real edge of your seat kinda story. Not terrific, but just a really juicy who-dunnit story.The story is about an investigation WHO, of the 150 people on board of a plane, is planning to kill someone. What makes matters more intriguing is the fact that the only cop on the plane (Liam Neeson), who has to do the investigation, is suspended and has a severe drinking problem.I know, I know, many of these Liam Neeson movies are predictable formula driven action plots, but some of those are really decently made, with a good plot and decent acting performances. This is one of those better Liam Neeson pictures. Very enjoyable to watch."
" The best of Liam Neeson since ""Taken""
",2019-09-21 00:00:00,10,"Non-Stop is a great thriller/suspension motion picture! This movie is tied with the ""Taken"" trilogy for ratings and non stop suspense. 20/10 hands down! If you don't watch this movie a person will die every 20 minutes from arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. please write a review after watching the movie so Liam gets his credit due for him."
" How about the crew?
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,5,"So so movie overall, although the outcome is 100% predictable before you even start the movie. One after another, thousands of movies with an almighty (usually American) hero who saves the day.
But....one question, though: is that normal, standard protocol for the plane's crew to evacuate among the first, before all passengers do? Maybe it is, but I was extremely surprised. Guess I learned something new."
" Best action movie i have ever seen
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,10,"The combination of action and mystery in this film makes him so exciting the acting was great and the final battle was so good
I loved it"
" Above Average: 6.0
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,6,"For whatever reason, Liam Neeson has decided to make himself a new action star. Since this decision was made, most of the actioners he's been in have been, at best, slightly above-average. NonStop, from the director of Unknown (another Liam Neeson action film), is no exception. The setup is actually a fairly interesting one. Neeson, an Air Marshal, boards a flight on which someone will die every twenty minutes unless he gives the unknown perpetrator $150 million. The claustrophobia that comes with the setting works well for this type of film, and there are no fewer than fifteen passengers that are presented as potential terrorists. People begin to drop without any apparent cause, the absurdity of the plot growing in direct proportion to the body count. Though the atmosphere is impeccable, the revelation of the cause and reason of the killings is just... stupid. There's really no other word for it. Overall, it's another slightly-above average Liam Neeson action movie."
" my notes
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,7,Awesome movie. intense throughout. made you think and wonder the whole movie. and good action. (2 viewings)
" Well done thriller for fun only
",2019-06-22 00:00:00,8,"Liam neeson and michelle dockery are the pros you can rely on. It's the usual mix of twists and turns that lose all reliability along the way. The tension is well done but like a 24 episode nothing else.
The bright spot is the incandescent Julianne moore who creates the only character that feels grounded enough you actually care if she survives.
She's worth the time alone."
" A ride that improves the closer you get to the explosive end!
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,8,"Liam Neeson is a very able actor, and he really manages to haul this improbable, illogical, and just too badly thought out story to the end in flying colours!For instance, the aircraft is escorted to Iceland by RAF fighters, who I doubt has jurisdiction in Icelandic Airspace.And a lot of minor details, like we see a lot of passengers using phones onboard a sticken aircraft over the Atlantic, was that really possible then, or even now?!And we are not really told how people are killed, and other minor trifels.The cast and crew are otherwise excellent, not least julianne Moore, the leading female actor, and Liam, of course."
" I don't blink !
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,10,"No one could ever replace Liam ! Such a breathtaking , jaw-dropping , spectacular and 100% amazing movie !"
" Cold, but interesting story.
",2019-05-15 00:00:00,8,"Non-Stop is one of the best films of Liam Neeson. The main reason that made me watch this film is because of Liam. His acting is superb, so, I always watch his films. I find it his films are quite good and interesting.Although I'm Liam's fan, I must admit that Non-Stop is quite cold and slow moving film. But I could keep watching it. The reason I kept watching was that I wanted to know who was making all those things.It's taken place on a plane. So, I sometimes wonder what if we encounter the same problem? Will there be someone who would save us? Maybe there is. Maybe there's no. But later, I considered that it's just a film.As I've said in above, the film is quite interesting. And I'm sure that Liam Neeson's fans will find it a great film. Although it's a bit cold, as for me, it's one of my favourite films."
" A very non-stop movie!
",2019-05-15 00:00:00,10,"This film is a mystery, action, and thriller genre that takes place on an airplane. Bill as the main actor who works as U.S. federal water marshal is terrorized, and the terrorists are also around in the aircraft. And the film is focused on revealing the identity of criminals terrorizing the safety of passengers on planes that fly from New York City to London.
The terrorist sent a short message to Bill with the message that Bill immediately send money worth $150 million to him and if it did not do so someone would die every 20 minutes. The film is full of puzzles, while watching this film, I keep trying to find out who the culprit is because everyone looks suspicious and what will happen in the next scene. In each scene, I was treated to a camera glare at certain people who could make me think, ""lest he is the culprit."" But it's unpredictable, people who look fine are actually bad people in the film.
The story of this film managed to make me tense, but my curiosity paid off because in the end everything was clearly presented. Bill in all his wise ways finally managed to save the plane and land safely. I'm sure everyone who watches this film won't regret it, ten out of ten!"
" Nice entertainment
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,6,"Thrilling action thriller, quite well done. When the villain is figured out the tension falls, but it's late in the movie. 2 hours of entertainment."
" Cliff Hanger
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,10,"I really enjoyed this movie. Be sure to take a restroom break and have a snack with you before you start this movie because you won't want to pause it. There is plenty of suspense and action. I love movies dealing with aircraft, submarines, large naval ships, law enforcement & the armed forces. This movie had two of those aspects and I was not let down. I may watch it again before the rental expires."
" Similar to Commuter (2018)
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,10,"This is very good movie. Similar to Commuter (2018) movie. The major difference being that this is happening on the plan, while in that movie it is happening on the train. Good idea, acting, emotional, teaching, high quality. Has some small funny things. Realistic. Raises our awareness about airplane highjacking and similar crimes. Worth watching and rewatching. And very mysterious, that is what was the best part of all, the mystery in the beginning, that causes us to think, figure things out, guess, similar to playing chess or puzzles. I think that air marshals, police, and anybody working with security is gonna like this one. Perfect like most other Liam Neeson's main actor movies."
" Liam Neeson's action career is non-stop....and I love it
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,8,"This is pretty much what we've come to expect from Liam Neeson these days - a gruff, jaded, middle-aged man with a colored past is begrudgingly thrown into a catastrophic situation in which he can trust no one, and he must transform into the gritty action hero that we have all come to know and love. I seriously never tire of watching Liam Neeson in these roles (I get unabashedly giddy every time a new ""Taken"" is announced), and he certainly does not disappoint in ""Non-Stop."" The writers did an amazing job with a story in which you are constantly questioning who the actual villain is, which at more than one point they lead you to believe might even be Neeson himself, and you can never quite shake that shadow of doubt.The supporting cast is just as much a part of this movie's appeal, with Julianne Moore (as her usual charming self), Michelle Dockery, and Corey Stoll sporadically muscling their way to the forefront, all the while casting doubt on their own motives. My only strike against it (and it might just be my mood today, because it's not a make-or-break kind of complaint) is that it doesn't truly reach a climax of epic proportions like it seems to build up to - but that's understandable because the entire movie takes place inside an airplane, so you can't exactly build up much larger than that. All in all, though, a very enjoyable little action flick, a nice way to spend a Saturday evening."
" The plot is well designed
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,6,"The plot is well designed to meet in the airtight space of the cabin. However, I think as an air police officer, there should be a way to stun, so the first person died unreasonably; who shot the captain, there is no detailed explanation. This is a big flaw in the plot."
" Amazing gripping Neeson movie
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,10,This movie is freaking amazing. Liam does an awesome job of a gripping tale that takes place on a plane
" Sexism against men
",2019-02-14 00:00:00,8,"As always in movies like this: save woman and children first. Or in this movie: place woman and children far away from the bomb while men... Well, men and luggage protect woman and children from the explosion of the bomb. So it is sexism if one says ""fireman"" but at the same time it is ok if one says that the live of a woman is more worth than the life of men. Disgusting ethic: judgement about a life's worth based on gender.Apart from that, the movie was entertaining and that is why I give it so many stars. But the critic above remains.."
" Quite silly!
",2019-02-11 00:00:00,6,"Despite a great cast, high techno effects, and some good moments--this film is so unbelievable it defies logic.... I really wanted to like it--but ultimately it was impossible."
" Absolutely loved this movie
",2019-02-11 00:00:00,10,I really enjoyed this movie! The characters and situation may have been known but the storyline is nicely done. And I love me a good twist.
" Tension-filled popcorn entertainer with lots of action and suspense!
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,10,"Non-Stop is a captivating action thriller that keeps you glued to the edge of your seats. No subplots, no slow parts, no unwanted stuff: just the main plot full of action and suspense. What else do you need? The film is in itself one big set piece with a sharp editing and brilliantly crafted tension. Liam Neeson is really amazing and delivers with sincerity, be it the action or the talkie parts. Despite of being set in a plane, the film's plot will not let you even think about lack of exotic locations. Fight scenes are outstanding and every action block brings a new turn to the story. In short, Non-Stop is an intense, thrill-a-minute action ride that won't let go of the grip it has on you till the end. Go ahead, watch it!"
" Great thriller
",2019-01-27 00:00:00,8,"Very Good thriller. All the story takes place in a plane and provides us with surprises.
Good acting of situation between characters."
" Basic action movie. Nothing exceptionally good or bad
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,6,Basic action movie. Nothing exceptionally good or bad.
" Liam Neeson is as good as ever
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,7,"Good suspense and good action. The first two-thirds of the film builds up the tension and keeps us guessing who is the real culprit. Minds and reality get mixed up and make us eager to see what comes next. Liam Neeson does the job convincingly.But the final part is a little disappointing. The culprit's motive sounds cheap. Other passengers are such good people (which is not bad in itself, but doesn't flow naturally from the first half of the film). Everything is forced into optimism at the end. Liam Neeson is as good as ever."
" First movie I couldn't figure out the bad guy!
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,8,"I just saw this movie for the 1st time. I liked it and it kept me involved. It is a good entertainment film. Sometimes slow, needed to develop the plot. Yes. I would recommend this movie."
" thriller in the sky
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it is a true psychological thriller to the genre in the sense that it keeps you guessing right until the very end. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" A very good piece of entertainment
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,7,"There are several unanswered questions, a few things don't make sense, but the story is great, every performace is great, the action is great, which all make up for the flaws this film carries. Neeson is fantastic in this!"
" A really enjoyable action thriller
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,8,"A really enjoyable action thriller with good special effects and acting, but is cheesy in parts, and the convoluted sequence of events and justification for the hijacking could have been much better. More should have been done to increase the tension in the (potentially) claustrophobic setting instead of just focusing on the flawed hero."
" The plot only moves forward because of miscommunication
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,5,"The problem with Non-Stop is that the plot only moves forward because of miscommunication and people acting stupidly. I know that happens a lot in movies, but it happens so much in this one, that it feels forced. However, despite the ridiculous ending, this movie does a great job of making you suspect everybody. So at least it has that going for it."
" Great movie!
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,8,I haven't seen a good movie in a long time! Very good ratings!! Definitely worth your time!!
" Empty Gun
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,8,"Marks at last decides to trust the NYPD officer and hands him his gun, A short time later the officer is shot and asks Mtaks ""you gave me an empty gun!"". What trained experienced police officer would fail to check the gun, to see if (a) it has a round in the chamber (b) it has rounds in the magazine?"
" Who is it Who is it Who is i!!!!!!!
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,8,"Again is a very nice Liam Neeson movie. If you guess who usually makes such films while watching the script, if the scenario is not good. I watched this movie with my family and we could not have guessed who the bad guy was. 
Thrill has not even fallen for a moment, the director is always doing these kinds of movies and really mastering it 
Liam Neeson and Jaume Collet-Serra have always liked the movies they have made together, and neither is it so bad, nor is it very nice to have a moderate viewing pleasure
lastly i like"
" Great movie!!!
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,7,"This movie is so great!!! Action is great, the thrill is great. The whole texting back and forth was great. You see that other movies afterwards. Almost like Die Hard 2, but not like it."
" Sadly disappointing!
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,3,"Spoilers! It's engrossing & suspenseful but in that almost too painful to watch way. Right off the bat then again every few minutes there's another absurd plot flaw. Why is a known alcoholic still employed as an Air Marshal? Why does Neeson order a drink he won't be served cuz the flight attendants know he's on duty? So hello passenger next to me: that's not oddly noticeable, she got her drink but he water when they ordered the same thing at the same time?? Why is the airline confirming a highjcking in progress to the news-seen on the plane live-identifying Neeson? How's that not make the situation more dangerous. Why are the passengers so belligerent (how about a racist stereotype of a rough black guy-really??)? Why is Neeson acting so volitlle & rough almost immediately? Again, creating passenger anxiety is counterintuitive?? Why can the tech guy turn on & find the highjackers phone but no one suggests he try to unlock it? Then why & I think this may be the most absurd of all, does Moore suggest GUESSING at the phones passcode? Why do they insist on disconnecting the planes WiFi?? Is it dangerous or something? It THAT what highjacked the plane-really how on earth does that help foil the way-too-quickly-concluded suspect Neeson's evil plan? It was so poorly written that I was waiting for the next huge gaping plot hole rather than what's going to happens next. So many so often I found it far more WTF frustrating than disappointing. Kinda feel sorry for Hollywood's pathetic miss on what could have been a great movie! Or at least not something the big name actors should perhaps be ashamed of taking part in if they respect their chosen profession? Sigh..."
" As Cheesy as it Gets
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,1,Simply just bad. Especially the last 20 minutes are completely unbelievable. I would never want to see it a second time.
" Non stop thrills and excitement
",2018-05-26 00:00:00,9,"A very very different type of movie and the cast played their part in making this one of the more enjoyable films I have seen this year. It wasn't until close to the end that I worked out who the villain was, you may do a bit better. I think this is quite original for ""airplane dramas"" and the ending very different from others I have seen - I would call this a ""must"" for all movie buffs, lots of originality in this for me and well worth watching, maybe even more than once"
" I enjoyed it but US bigots won't
",2018-05-17 00:00:00,6,"I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was really good, the suspense was fine with me. It wasn't the best movie in the world, but from the negative reviews you can see many bigots watched and took offence at a Muslim not being the bad guy. An American was the bad guy, and they couldn't handle that. That makes this movie anti-American apparently. Whereas, when people from other countries are bad guys in other movies, it isn't considered anti- those countries by blind bigots. If a Muslim is the bad guy it's just normal and natural apparently (even though most of the crimes committed in America are done so by Americans). In y country when someone is the same background as me and committing a terrorist offence, I don't take it personally but you can see here that other people do."
" Nothing new!
",2018-05-11 00:00:00,6,"Whilst the film is watchable, Non Stop really offers no thing new to the airplane crisis type films."
" Dreadful but dreadfully entertaining
",2018-05-10 00:00:00,5,"Not since the heyday of the ""Airport"" franchise has there been a dafter Airplane picture than ""Non-Stop"" in which alcoholic air-marshall Liam Neeson has to deal with a psychopathic terrorist on board a non-stop transatlantic flight to London. If the ludicrous script doesn't quite provide a laugh a minute it certainly comes close as the passengers start dying on cue and a good supporting cast; Julianne Moore, Scoot McNairy, Michelle Dockery, Lupita Nyong'o, (wasted since winning her Oscar), Corey Stoll, Nate Parker look on in disbelief. It may be dreadful but it's also dreadfully entertaining, though that doesn't necessarily mean it's worth seeing."
" Great thriller/mystery movie
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,8,"""Pure non-stop action"" is what seems to be the main motif to Liam Neeson's movies now. This was certainly marketed and perceived by most people as such. I beg to differ with this one.The acting is above-par with what you would see in the average popcorn action flick. The title itself certainly indicates that this is an action movie that never stop moving, which is true, but it has less to do with non-stop action. This movie is all about mystery. It is a cleverer movie than Taken, albeit Neeson plays a very similar role. However the suspense and questioning of all the passengers on board makes this movie more akin to Flightplan. It is the basis of being trapped with no means out and being the only person onboard who is convinced of what is truly happening. The action in the movie is certainly worth the watch, having close quarters fighting that makes for very interesting fighting styles in the enclosed spaces. Neeson also appears larger than ever with his 6'4"" frame towering over everyone on the plane. A very solid movie with great twists and turns that is slightly better than the Neeson flicks he's been typecast in since Batman Begins & Taken."
" Worth multiple watch
",2018-04-09 00:00:00,8,"Without revealing too much, I will say that this film was interesting because it was not easy to predict the outcomes...
Indeed nothing is more boring than a story to which you can predict what will happen. Beside a good story we have here superior acting performances...even by supporting roles.
Fasten your seat-belt and enjoy more then average entertainment."
" Non-Stop may not be as relentless as its title suggests, but it is undeniably entertaining.
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,7,"I despise the title of this film. Automatically brings out connotations of blandness and genericness, kind of like a Straight-To-DVD low budget action film starring Bruce Willis or Nicholas Cage. However, the Neeson and Collet-Serra combination is a winning formula as this is yet another fun ride. A damaged Air Marshal is trapped in a murderous mystery where he must transfer $150 million to a bank account. If he doesn't, a passenger will meet their demise every 20 minutes until he does so. All of this happens on board a long plane journey. It works, it works so well. Very reminiscent to 'Flightplan', but far more focussed on the characters. Like with any mystery, the list of suspects need to be developed to a point where the final reveal shocks you. Given the small runtime, I believe the character developments were adequate. Their backstories and motives are naturally revealed. It's not a case of our protagonist interviewing each one in turn, he instead provokes them and addresses the passengers as one entity. Sure there are times where he questions individuals, which is necessary to identify possible suspects, but that cannot be avoided. I appreciate the small details in these characters. Moore's vulnerability is shown as she explains why she sits on the window seat, our Air Marshal's troubled past is revealed which questions the authenticity of his actions. It's very twisty, full of turns and a meticulously thought out narrative. The final reveal and motives are slightly blurred and unmemorable, although I was still on the edge of my seat...even after my fifth viewing! The claustrophobic environment adds to the suspense and tension. Liam Neeson still thrives on his rejuvenated action career. I did roll my eyes at the end where he was saving the little girl, makes his character arc far too predictable. Non-Stop is not going to fly away as a classic thriller, but it lands with such confidence that it's hard not to enjoy this."
" Do I have your attention now?
",2018-02-21 00:00:00,6,Bill (Liam Neeson) is an Air Marshall who likes his drink too much. While on a flight he gets a terrorist threat over his secure phone line. A passenger will die every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred into a specific account. Thus begins a great game of cat and mouse that was excellently written and performed. The problem I had was when the culprit was revealed the motive was so unbelievably lame. Seriously? That was the best thing 5 guys could come up with?A thriller worth watching once they get an alternative ending.Parental Guide: 1 F Bomb near end by co-pilot. No sex or nudity. Implied sex as couple giggles under blanket.
" Non stop rubbish
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,1,"What a pity to see acting talent like Neeson and Moore wasted on this nonsensical plot.
For starters, almost the entire film is spent inside the aircraft, and before that, for a few minutes, inside an airport, making it an almost unbearably claustrophobic film. As if that were not unpleasant enough, Moore disappears from the screen for long periods, almost as if she leaves the plane, only to return to speak a few pointless lines to Neeson. She is not even seen mingling with other passengers, she does not appear in passenger group shots, but, rather, moves suspiciously around the toilet area, near the air hostesses and cockpit, and she contributes ZERO to the plot, apart from what appears to be a sudden blossoming of unexpected love for Neeson in the movie's last frames. Neeson, usually a highly reliable actor, is apathetic and never comes into his own in this flick - but then, he is not helped by a script that variously makes him a hero or a vlllain, and where passengers facing bomb and other threats actually have the luxury of watching TV and learning that Neeson is a psychopath cop, as if personal data like that were conveyed over TV, especially when there are hundreds of lives at risk in an aircraft under attack from a villain who is anything but credible or menacing, and who, for no apparent reason, actually saves Neeson from passenger lynching at one point.There is another, NYPD cop on board, but he is just as dumb and gullible as the would-be robbers/criminals, and tenderfoot as the little girl who reminds Neeson of his own dead daughter. So schmaltzy...The final straw in terms of credibility is the bomb that explodes and yet the plane is able to land with everyone apparently unscathed. I could have kicked myself for watching this NON-STOP rubbish to the end. Best avoided. Gets 1 star because I can't zero it."
" Wasn't expecting that
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,9,Nothing on TV so had a look at my Amazon Prime Video and thought I'd spend an hour or so of escapism to kill time. But wow this is a very tense and exciting movie with the usual Neeson but the plot line and direction are superb. Twists and turns all over the place. A real whodunnit for over an hour. Would have been a ten but for the ending which was slightly rushed compared with the rest of the film.
" Non-Stop is an entertaining thriller ride with mysterious story plot.
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,7,"Non Stop: Movie Review. Non Stop will keep you on the edge of your seat and will keep you guessing till the end. The film is an okay entertaining thriller. Liam Neeson is totally rocking. Liam Neeson has once again given a rock solid performance which make Non-Stop a movie worth watching. Liam Neeson delivers a good one. Action Sequences are good and up to the mark. The story line plot and twist is surprising but looses little of its tension and intensity and its mysterious tone at the end.But all over its a good Liam Neeson action film with somewhat a surprising thrilling plot twist.(Please Note: That This Review represent only my professional point of view and my personal honest opinion about the film, and does not represent others. Thank You)."
" Like Flightplan a great and relevant movie, and who considers the plot illogical / exaggerated, is the proof of the realism of it
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,10,"This movie shows a lot parallels to Flightplan, (if I had to pick one I would choose the female power of Jodie, and because Non-Stop is slightly heavier on the action-side and Flightplan slightly more on the drama-side, but) both movies are fantastic and their biggest success is that beside being extremely thrilling, they show the pain and the powerlessness and stress when you know you know/speak the truth, but you are being manipulated in such a way that nobody believes you. And to people who think the plots are illogical/exaggerated etc. - well, I can only say: these people are the proof of the realism of the plot. Fates are different, and correspondingly ignorant and arrogant is some people's behavior. The people who think the plot is unbelievable are usually the ones who trust the bombers / blackmailers / liars and applaud them (they are not always bombers, but they are, for example, spiritual instigators and more often than not money is their goal as well) and the victims who do know the truth, they do not believe them, they disrespect and even blame them and make their life a torment. This is happening every day, and only the ignorant / arrogant / inexperienced and naive, who have always been lucky and have never experienced suffering and lack of respect and lack of support and never really had to fight hard, deny this - and they think their happiness is their own achievement alone - ha ha, how nasty and blind can people be (it is exactly these people who never had to struggle). And that these movies successfully address and show this phenomenon is a success of its own, and in addition there is the superb acting, and an extremely suspenseful production. Check them both out!"
" Good actions and great mystery
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,8,"One day, Bill Marks who is a federal air marshal officer received email on the flight and it says if he doesn't meet the sender's request, one of the passengers will die after 20min, so he try to find the sender.This film conceals the sender from audiences very well. Most of scenes are showed at Bill's view so I didn't expect who is the sender until last scene. Moreover, many times finding suspects effectively confused me. What I surprised most is Bill is being made out to be a terrorist by sender's plan naturally. At that scene, I thought the sender (the screenwriter of this film, actually) is truly genius. A flight, a security officer, and death, the story seems very common from these words, but this film is really great.In addition, action scene is also good. Liam Neeson acted Bill very cool. Action scenes are not many in this film, but I think enough to fascinate audiences because that flight situation was used very well.Thus, by concealing the sender and cool action, I enjoyed this film without any moments of boring."
" Silly is not the word, it is retarded
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,2,"Why a man like this Bill (that hates flying) would hold on to such a job is silly, likewise that he abuses alcohol while on the job.But it is retarded that the film does not get into how the criminals behind did it (not only getting into the network, but also being able to hide it, and hiding going to the bathroom), that is retarded."
" Entertaining, makes you stay fixed to the screen.
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,9,"Probably not the best plot, or not even a perfect crew of actors besides Liam Neeson, but the good point of the movie is none of those, but the thrill it gives you on certain moments. It leaves you to keep trying to think and guess who is the responsible behind the scenes, but it keeps you around, with no clue at all, and that is what will make you with your eyes fixed to the screen, because you want to know who is behind all this. What also got my attention was that in certain moments, everything change, and all my guesses were wrong and it backs to 0. A very interesting movie, but if you are looking for an action movie or a movie with a shooting scene, that is not your movie, this is the kind of movie, the involves terrorism and stays with the thriller type."
" Far-fetched but definitely exciting
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,8,"Bill Marks is an air marshal on a flight from New York to Heathrow and as is to be expected in this sort of film he has his issues; in this case a drink problem following the death of his daughter some years ago. The flight starts normally enough as he chats to Jen, the woman seated next to him, but then he gets a message on his secure phone stating that a passenger will die every twenty minutes unless he arranges for $150,000,000 is placed in a numbered Swiss bank account. He initially assumes the other air marshal, Jack Hammond, is playing a joke but he assures Bill that he isn't. Shortly afterwards Jack is seen using his phone as he enters the toilet; Bill confronts him again this time Jack attacks him and after the fight Jack is dead. Soon Bill gets another message; the hijacker is still out there and one person is indeed dead. Now Bill knows the threat is very real and must decide who he can trust; there is Nancy, stewardess he knows and Jen who he instinctively trusts. He enlists their help to try to spot who is sending the messages. As time passes, and more people die, the tension rises and he even starts to question whether he can trust these two; then to make matters worse the airline start to believe that he is actually the hijacker!It must be said that the plot is rather far-fetched and there are a few plot-holes that surprisingly didn't bother me while I was watching as the tension was so high. This is largely down to Liam Neeson's portrayal of Bill Marks; he brings an intensity to the role that makes him believable even when what is going on isn't very likely. He is ably supported by Michelle Dockery as Nancy and the always dependable Julianne Moore as Jen. The setting provides us with lots of suspects so the viewer should be kept guessing till the very end. This ending is thrilling even though the hijacker's motive is particularly far-fetched. Before this finale there is a good amount of action, some of it fairly intense. Overall I'd say that I enjoyed this a lot more than I expected and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed Liam Neeson's other action films or who just enjoys the genre in general."
" Liam Neeson........on a plane!!!
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,6,"'Non-Stop' is yet another action vehicle for Liam Neeson and director Jaume Collet-Serra, having previously worked together in 'Unknown'. Entertaining and thrilling, but this flight is a long one.1. For the most part, the movie has a mysterious and intriguing setup. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sucked in at the beginning. The plot involves former cop and now 'Federal Air-Marshall' Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) as he reluctantly performs his duty overseeing a red-eye flight from New York to London. He soon begins to receive random and threatening text messages from a mysterious terrorist who just may be one of the passengers on board. I honestly thought the plot might have been straight forward, but it ends up being more intricate and I was pleasantly surprised.2. As interesting of a mystery this film is, it turns into more of a thriller not long after. When the unknown figure lives up to his threats, the tension begins to build as Liam Neeson races against the clock to find the killer. However, all good things must come to an end. For a movie that has a great beginning and middle, the twist that is revealed in the last third is heavily underwhelming. The film plays to it's advantage as a suspenseful thriller, but looses all momentum when it delves into the generic action realm at the end. It feels like studio interference to the original script.3. If there is one saving grace, it is Liam Neeson himself. For an actor who has jumped into action films in recent years, Neeson is still a theatrically trained actor and he delvers an exceptional performance no matter what he stars in. Julianne Moore, Corey Stoll and Michelle Dokery round out the cast. Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o also appears, but she is completely misused in her role. This film was on the brink of being something more than what it was, but it all comes down to wasted potential. I personally enjoy thrillers, but I was disappointed to say the least.Even though the movie lost a lot of points for the climax, It was still an entertaining flick. If you're a fan of Liam Neeson, then no matter the flaws, this would still be on your watch-list."
