The plot
The special effects."
" My least favorite of the movie franchise. Too much David. I didn't care about him or his history. Spiritual mumbo jumbo made up here. Selene is still great.
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,6,"This appears to take place far into the future. In the first couple of movies, Selene is 600 years old, here she describes herself as being 1000 years old. So whatever happened with the war with humans is kind of forgotten about. I'm guessing because the previous movie wasn't liked very well. But it's kind of confusing because of the the tiny flash of her daughter has her looking really young.Too much David, Selene's fanboy. I don't care about him. I don't care about his history. Not enough Selene. But I loved her every moment they had her onscreen. The spiritual stuff was kind of stupid. They just all of a sudden make it up here.Selene being tired of ""the life"", or leaving her daughter didn't seem to ring true. This is badassed Selene we're talking about here. No way!. She can take care of her kid, especially since said-kid can take of herself.Semira was one-dimensional. Marius was a punk. Varga was a wimp. See how impressed I was with these new characters.The movie didn't have a cheap look like the last movie, so that was good. Had some nice building structures and scenery.I hope if they make more movies they don't decide to make David the star of it. I'd have to stop watching then. As it is, they killed Michael off in this movie as we find out what happened to him. I feel like that act sums up this movie and the state of the franchise. Selene was still great in the action scenes and I still enjoyed her journey, tho not crazy about the whole elder peace guru stuff.I think they should have went with something else in Selene's past history in order to create the plot for the fifth movie. I think the big issue seems to be that the writers didn't know what in hell to do with the kid. Even if she was grown-up now, it sort of stuck Selene in a corner they didn't know how to get out of, so basically they sent the kid away, yet the plot is all about her.I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. However I still love Selene. I still think she's an awesome female character. And I love watching her action scenes. 6/10"
" More of the same
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,4,"Fifth instalment in the Underworld franchise, Lycans (werewolves) versus Vampires, Vampires versus Vampires, Vampire loves Lycan, treachery, double crosses, lots of flashbacks, if you are familiar with these movies then you know what to expect. And lots of CGI, pretty cheap and cartoonish looking. Personally I've completely lost interest in the story but there are two reasons why I have continued watching the series. Firstly I am a horror addict (this film is a an action/horror with the emphasis on action). Secondly, Kate Beckinsale dressed in tight black leather and kicking some serious ass! She herself has apparently said that this is her last but no doubt, with or without her, there will be more."
" Game of Underworld Thrones!
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,5,"The fifth and hopefully last entry in the Underworld franchise. Underworld: Blood Wars was released in (2016) and is probably the most generic and forgettable action movie in the entire franchise. The previous entry Underworld: Awakening (2012) was an attempt to revive the franchise adding new characters and a new storyline that took place in a more modern day setting. Awakening failed to add anything of interest or worth to a storyline that should have ended with Underworld Evolution (2006). Instead of rebooting the franchise or doing something ""you know"" different the writers and producers of Underworld just keep adding more and more lazy plot devices to a story that ended over ten years ago just to make money.The story this time around follows Selene (Kate Beckinsale) shortly after the events of the last movie. Selenes daughter Eve has since abandoned her and made her promise never to come looking for her so neither Vampires or Lycan can hunt her down and take her blood. Selene remains an outcast to her kind. She now roams the city still looking for Michael but never finding him. The war between Vampires and Lycan continues to rage as the last of the vampire covens reaches out to Selene through David (Theo James) the young vampire she brought back from the dead in last movie and his father Thomas (Charles Dance). The covens council made up of the last of the oldest vampires enlists the help of Selene to train a new generation of Death Dealers so the coven can survive an attack by a new Lycan clan led by a new powerful Lycan named Marius (Tobias Menzies) who is also hunting for Selenes daughter Eve. Selene along with the help of David uncover a traitorous plot devised by council member Semira (Lara Pulver) to steal Selenes powerful blood so she can rule over the last of the vampires without the council.The previous entry took place in a world where humankind knew of the existence of vampires and lycan and were at war with both species. Humankind hunted both species down almost to point of extinction with both vampires and lycan barely surviving. In Blood Wars however humankind have just simply forgotten about those pesky vampire and Lycan theres not even a footnote explaining what happened nothing. Throughout the entire movie the only time you see humans is during overhead shots of the city and when Selene and David take a train journey that's literally it.This is undoubtedly one of the most boring and generic vampire/werewolf action movies I have ever seen. The action what little there is of it is just vampires and werewolves shooting each other with guns GUNS! for god sake when they have fangs and claws and the Lycan can even turn into savage werewolf creatures but instead they just shoot each other and use riot shields. The first two Underworld movies were filled with so much blood and gore that it was awsome to watch for action alone. The Lycan only transform a few times throughout the movie and the transformations look awful and CGI heavy with no blood or body transformation effects like in the first two movies.Kate Beckinsale and Charles Dance are the only ones in the entire movie with any real acting talent. The cast are so bland and generic looking that you could put them in any teenage action movie like The Hunger Games or The Divergent series and they would fit right in.Don't waste your time and money watching this movie it's arguably the worst movie in the entire franchise and hopefully it will be the final entry before they do something even more ridiculous like Underworld in space."
" Selene's Final Battle
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,3,"'Underworld Blood Wars' represents something of a milestone as it's still one of the few action movies with a heroine in her forties. But sadly Kate Beckinsale declared after this anaemic fifth instalment that That's All Folks; so there's little chance of seeing her don her fighting gear to continue going Hell for Leather as the vampires' ""most deadly death-dealer"" at fifty. Alas, in what is probably Selene's farewell to the screen she's absent from much of the action anyway; and for far too much of her time onscreen (save very occasional highlights like a scene demonstrating injury techniques to an audience of trainee death-dealers) wears a greatcoat over her catsuit.As befits a film directed by a woman there are more female characters in this one, but like everyone else in the film they all talk far too much in hushed tones and at great length. One keeps wishing everyone would lighten up for a moment; and to call it incoherent implies there was ever a plot in the first place. If there WAS another instalment maybe Phoebe Waller-Bridge could be brought in to give the proceedings a bit more focus and humour."
" Huh?????
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,10,Fighting to end an eternal war??? Is that even a thing??
" Continuation of the ""Underworld: Awakening""
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,1,"No story, no plot, no meaning! Just like ""Underworld: Awakening"" this movie is empty and soulless. If you liked original trilogy, you will be utterly disappointed."
" Underworld: Blood Wars
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,10,"Great to see Kate Beckinsale in latex again. The action is supe-choppy and sloppily made film.
I wouldn't recommend watching this if you haven't seen part 1,2,3,4!"
" So sad
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,3,"The previews made it seem like this was going to be a good movie, boy was I wrong. This is the worst film in the franchise. Boring dialog, boring scenes. Stupid pacing, players doing stupid things. Poor timing of scenes. Stupid musdled plot. The villain had zero presence, was not scary or intimidating at all, did not have the charisma of the actor who played Lucian in the other movies. Oh, did I say this movie is so boring. Did not care one iota about any of the characters. There are long periods between action scenes and the action was subpar. In some of the gun scenes I was like ""They can't hit anyone waving a machine gun in close proximity? "" there just was zero but in as far as the motivations for the villain."
" Underworld: Blood Wars
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,4,"The Underworld movies have been a mixed bag over the years, the original was adequate, Evolution was boring, Rise of the Lycans was okay, and Awakening was silly, so I had pretty low expectations about this fifth film in the franchise. Basically, the war between the Vampires and the Lycans wages on, with the Lycans, led by Marius (Tobias Menzies) close to defeating the Vampires. Vampire death dealer Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is fighting both sides, as she betrayed her own kind. Her only allies are her protégé and Vampire hybrid David (Theo James) and his father Thomas (Charles Dance). In between the fighting, Marius is searching for Selene's hybrid daughter, as her blood is key to defeating the Vampires once and for all. The Lycans attempt to capture Selene, but after defeating most of those sent in a fight, she spares one and tells him to tell Marius that she does not know where her daughter is, as she has cut ties with her. At the same time, fiercely ambitious vampire Semira (Lara Pulver) tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted amnesty so that she could train new Death Dealers to deal with the Lycans. They grant it and send word to Selene who comes and trains the aspiring Death Dealers. But Semira has Varga (Bradley James), her ally and lover, poison Selene and slaughter the trainees, framing Selene for the atrocity. Selene is paralysed and her blood is drained, Semira intends to drink it to steal her power. David learns of what Semira, and alongside vampire warrior Lena (Clementine Nicholson) they rescue Selene and take her to a safe stronghold. Semira drinks the blood taken from Selene and kills Eastern Coven vampire Alexia (Daisy Head) for treachery. David returns where he presents himself as the rightful heir and denounces Semira, even Varga deserts her, and she is taken away to the dungeons. Marius and his forces attack the walls of the castle, and Selene suddenly reappears to do battle, dispatching the Lycans. There is a moment when Marius subdues Selene and confronts her himself to find out where her daughter, but he realises that she genuinely has no idea of what has happened to her. They later fight each other, and a drop of his blood touches her lips, and suddenly she is suddenly flooded by blood memories of Marius finding Michael, the father of her daughter. She sees Marius capturing Michael, then slitting his throat to collect his blood and consume it. Although Marius has transformed, Selene rips out his spine, killing him instantly, while David kills Semira, who is distracted finding that she can walk in sunlight. In the aftermath, Selene, David, and Lena are chosen as new Elders. It ends with Selene seeing what looks like her daughter Eve, who has telepathic powers that would help lead her, walking in the distance towards the sanctuary. Also starring James Faulkner as Cassius, Peter Andersson as Vidar, and Oliver Stark as Gregor. Beckinsale is fine as the tough leading female, British talents Dance and Menzies also do well, and Pulver is memorable as the fiendish female villain. If you have not seen the previous films, then the good news is that it opens with a flashback to all four previous films, and there are other bits and pieces of them throughout. I'm not going to pretend I understood or cared about previous events, I didn't pay much attention to be honest, but at least the fight sequences and special effects are good, like the others, a below average action horror. Okay!"
" Blood Wars does not offer us anything new, even though it is a gratifying return to the origins of the franchise
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,5,"After four films, the Underworld franchise arrives in its fifth episode. Initially announced as a reboot of the franchise, Underworld: Blood Wars, ended up becoming another continuation of the saga of Selene, the vampire, played by Kate Beckinsale, who had become an outcast of her race. We have here the first feature of the series whose story was not written by Len Wiseman, even though the director remained as producer of the work. The plot begins by revisiting what was previously presented, as usual in the saga. This can be praised as a way to contextualize the scenario for the occasional audience, but I see it as an inability to create a single product or a certificate that they know that the audience itself has no memory of what happened. To make matters worse, part of the plot existing in other films is set aside - at this point even fans can revolt. Who is not a fan of the franchise, the chance to be disappointed and find everything very confusing and repetitive, is huge. Repetitive, by the way, is the word of the day. It is almost always the same and now it is no different.Years have passed since Selene (Kate Backinsale) discovered she had a daughter with Michael Corvin. Away from all those she loves, she remains in her search for her beloved and ends up becoming the target of the lycans, who now have a new leader, Marius (Tobias Menzies). This, however, is only the first of its problems, since the vampire Semira (Lara Pulver) has other plans, involving the protagonist's blood. Fortunately, Selene has some allies, such as David (Theo James), whose first appearance had occurred in The Awakening and his father, Thomas (Charles Dance), one of the oldest immortals still alive.It is true to say that Cory Goodman's script seems more like a succession of attempts to do something interesting, but that they end up not developing completely. Little of what was shown in ""The Awakening"" is relevant here, with the war between the two races returning to the stage and humans barely being mentioned. The franchise did not talk about magic, putting the origins of vampires and werewolves in a pseudoscience, something abandoned by the new feature that not only presents spells and magic as a concept of afterlife without foot or head, throwing in the trash the (already little) series coherence. The actions taken by some characters are of unspeakable stupidity and the conclusion of the villainous Semira's plan brings laughter from the audience, destroying all the effort that actress Lara Pulver makes to give some credibility to the character. It is also sad to see Kate Beckinsale suffering to give Selene some weight, in view of her daughter's removal, but she is sabotaged by a script that makes the protagonist make decisions that contradict everything we have seen so far. Theo James fails to pass the minimum of conflict in his appearances, even after an important revelation about his past and Charles Dance finds himself criminally wasted on the scene.
However, now under the direction of Anna Foerster, the first woman to direct a film in the franchise, which also marks its debut on the big screen, the franchise gains one more point for bringing female characters of greater prominence. Evidently, the protagonist had always been a woman, but, besides her, all the other relevant characters were men, since even the elderly Amelia had not lasted more than five minutes on screen in the first film. This factor ends up offering new airs for the saga, differentiating the work from what came before considerably. The plot puts three or four female characters in an agency position on the plot: centrally the vampire Selene (Beckinsale), who all hunt, and the villain Semira (Lara Pulver), who conspires and manipulates, in addition to two other vampires (whose role you don't want to deliver here). They are the ones who set in motion and decide history, in a series that in addition always dealt with progressive themes such as pacifism and miscegenation.While the script falls into sameness, what saves the work is the acting work of the entire main cast. With interesting names, the franchise continues to attract us by its portrayal of vampires and werewolves, who, naturally, dialogue with the social classes of our world - one side representing the aristocracy and the other the one subjugated by it. What harms this portrait is the clear rush of the script, which accelerates many developments in an exaggerated way. Many sequences sound like snippets of trailers, exhibiting only a few key points, which hinder the organic progression of the narrative. That said, another problem with Underworld is the way the protagonist's evolution is carried out. From one hour to the next she undergoes a metamorphosis that ends up sounding like a classic example of God ex machina, guaranteeing her what is necessary to overcome the threat in question.The interesting script by Cory Goodman and Kyle Ward manages to add new mythologies to the worn out plot and give an air of freshness to Selene's journey, opening doors to new sequences and ending with praise the loose ends left by the last films, bringing a greater focus about vampire society, which had been portrayed as in ruins since Viktor's death. Here the council returns and, with it, we have a deeper view of how this world works. Unfortunately, this ends up in opposition to what we saw in the previous film - humans are practically forgotten, as if the extermination of the creatures of the night had never existed. Yes, there are mentions that vampires are on the verge of extinction, but the human race is never blamed, no matter how much it was controlled by werewolves in The Awakening. Unfortunately, the old lycan war with vampires is already showing great wear and tear. What we see here is practically the same as what we saw in the first feature and the one before Blood Wars, with subtle differences that, in fact, do not change our view of the narrative as a whole. The necessary renovation of the main narrative line never happens, only in the final minutes, which can mean a sequence that, at last, renews the franchise once and for all, but that is only a hope.
There are moments when the visual of Underworld: Blood Wars surprises, perhaps because Kate Beckinsale herself is as beautiful as she was in the previous films in her leather outfit, just a delusion. The locations are interesting, though few. Some visual choices turn out to be poor and tacky (see the pacifist vampire clan), struggles are lacking in imagination, digital creatures are miserable and the atrocious 3D mixed with the dark tones of the photo make the film almost physically painful to watch, but all of this pales in the face of the dark assembly of production. Foerster and editor Peter Amundson (believe me, a skilled professional with great films like ""Circle of Fire"" and ""Hellboy"") managed to make mistakes even in conducting a plan / counterpoint in dialogues, inexplicably pricking a simple conversation between two characters. The photograph continues with the same bluish palette. This is consistent with the visual identity that has been established. The question that remains is: who thought that choice was in good taste? The supposedly Gothic air is pushed down the throat, this being - the pseudo somber tone - the crutch used.The director, Anna Foerster, is a TV veteran, with her work on the TV series ""Outlander"" as her main CV, but she is completely lost in her big screen debut. The director also shows that she has no idea how to command action sequences, which was for the most important point of a film like this. Foerster misses on the same point that is becoming common in North American action cinema: excessive cuts and camera axes that end up making it impossible for the viewer to understand what is happening. You cannot understand the blows given by the characters, because when the blow happens, there is a cut on top. This ends up taking the impact of the blow and the viewer cannot understand the choreography of the scene, and we do not understand the spatial relationship of the characters.Underworld had everything to become a great franchise in cinema, which in a way happened due to the regularity that the series demonstrated and how it manages to draw audiences, but the quality ended up falling too much, even earning high production is always treated like a film low budget, resulting in scenes that are not convincing and we see many of these scenes in Wars of Blood. The battle of Vampires, Lycans and the races themselves should be explored in a more intelligent way, and now what lies ahead is totally uncertain. It is a fact that Wars of Blood has everything to generate new profits and keep the franchise standing, but it is also very evident that a more serious and cohesive arc is necessary for the continuations to be relevant.In the end, Underworld: Blood Wars does not offer us anything new, even though it is a gratifying return to the origins of the franchise. With points that sound lost in the script and a narrative progression too fast, the work ends up qualifying as a simple action movie, made just for fun, but without delivering anything deeper than that. Still, it is a work that will surely please fans of the franchise and lovers of vampires or werewolves will find a good refuge from the terrible productions that we usually see in cinema today. Underworld, however, needs a makeover - something that differentiates old films from new ones, so that, finally, the Selene saga moves forward. Selene's story is not finished, but that also does not mean that it should be continued, after all what the viewer expects when entering the Angels of the Night is a lot of stylized action and not understanding the protagonist's personal relationships."
" Time to stick it to the heart
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,3,"This is just another example for what happens when they really want to skim every drop out of a franchise but they run out of original ideas so they make fool of themselves.I mean, story is absolutely ridiculous. They thought they added a few twists in but actually they turned it in a real s***show. No continuity, no developed characters and even the lead Selene lost her character and importance. I was lost already in first 10 mins.This is when they need to push the wooden stick to the heart and end the the series. I am glad Kate Beckinsale already rejected to take part in possible future installments. They really should learn a lesson and leave it here."
" Massively underrated
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,7,"Just watched this with my partner. I had seen the early films in the Underworld series but lost track around the 3rd or 4th one. My partner had never seen any of them so watched this as a stand alone. We were both very entertained throughout. Great acting all round, stunning visual effects, nice leads and twists along the way within the story line. Would highly recommend this to anyone that likes the vampire/werewolf genre. Don't understand why this wasn't received better? We want more!!"
" Incredibly rushed
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,5,"They tried to fit about 3 hours of content into 1.5 hours and it didn't work at all. Simply put, the pacing and character development was atrocious.Characters are introduced rapidly and given next to no development whatsoever. Relationships, past histories, and motivations of characters are essentially just briefly summarized and not revisited.This contributes to a hurried look and feelings of discontent throughout.Moments that the writers wanted to be significant feel quite lacking. For example, Selene's battle that ends in her ""death"" is not momentous at all, and the rest of the action scenes are not improved over those from previous movies.
Awakening and Bloodwars essentially work (barely) as filler movies and nothing else. I expect a true ending that TAKES THE TIME to close the series effectively."
" Don't believe the hype
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,7,"I am a horror fan and love the Underworld movies and this was no way near as bad as some of the reviews. Kate Beckinsdale in tight leather, a few plot twists and some good fight sequences. Does what it says on the tin."
" Too short.
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,6,"This film actually runs for 1 hour 16 minutes, leaving out the extensive credits and the repeated beginning from Awakening. Is that good enough? Not for me I'm afraid. Seems they're just interested in cashing in on the franchise. No more sequels please."
" At Worst; Still Better Than Awakening
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,5,"I am overall very torn on how I feel about Blood Wars. There are a lot of aspects of this movie that I simultaneously quite liked as well as really didn't like, all in the same breath. I have always clocked into Underworld movies for the lore and continuity between them. When that lore or continuity is thrown out the window, it leaves a bad taste in the mouth, which puts Blood Wars in an interesting position. We open up with both Michael and Eve missing, and Selene given up looking for either of them. The whole plot of Awakening where humans are aware of Vampires and Lycans, and have brought them both to the brink of extinction isn't even touched upon at all. On one hand I liked this because Scott Speedman was always terrible, Eve's hybrid make-up was terrible, and the way the Awakening plot was handed was terrible. Blood Wars goes out of its way to actively negate Awakening and carry on as if it never happened, beyond a few minor references here and there. But is breaking the continuity of a bad movie a good excuse to break continuity? Awakening leaves us with a nice cliffhanger to get picked up, and it never is, making the ending of that movie all the more frustrating. Can you imagine if Evolution decided to just not resolve the cliffhanger of Markus reawakening? That's exactly what Blood Wars does. It's even more of an insult when Michael's fate is revealed late into the third act, off-screen. At least Awakening tried to actually show Michael, regardless of how short and unsatisfactorily it was dealt with.So free of the burden of Awakening, Blood Wars shifts to a completely different direction, in an attempt to bring it all back to the struggle between Vampires and Lycans in the first three movies. We even get some power struggles between the Vampire elites, making this the most Underworld-feeling movie since the first, at least on paper. They make an attempt with visuals too, by going back to that Eastern European feeling and Gothic architecture. Even better is we actually expand on that with some Nordic influences, giving the film a chance to expand on the Underworld lore beyond the Corvinus legend. Plot twists and background revelations are back, but how these are presented is...questionable at best. We learn that a relatively new character to the franchise is related to a Vampire elder, which is cool, plays into the power struggle, but also comes completely out of nowhere, and the explanation leaves a lot to be desired (as in, they barely explain it at all).There's also a new Lycan on the scene, who's stronger than the rest, forming his own army to take on the Eastern coven. He just needs the blood of Eve to have a chance of getting through their defences. So who is he? Why is he so strong? The first question is never answered. He's just some random Lycan who's come into power for some unknown reason. The source of his power is explained to a point, in a shocking, albeit downright lazy revelation. So how do they display his power above other Lycans? With a whole new CG model...with a human face. He just looks like an over-large, super muscular and hairy human. Like the worst, cheesiest combination of human and hybrid. It reminded me of the creature in the Thing remake/prequel, or the Scorpion King in The Mummy Returns. Anyway, eventually, with Eve nowhere to be found, the army of Lycans decide to just storm the Vampire fortress anyway, and almost win thanks to blowing out the windows. Why does a Vampire mansion have windows? No idea, but after the initial Vampire melting, it doesn't seem to matter much anyway, because the Nordic vampires come along with their anti-UV skin (I assume anyway).All right, plot and continuity is not this movie's strong point. In truth, it hasn't been a strong point of the franchise in a very long time, so these discrepancies really didn't bother me as much as they should. Likewise continuing to ignore the industrial sonic identity of the first two movies in favour of a generic orchestral score didn't bother me nearly as much as it did in Awakening, because I was prepared for that. But the action is still fairly strong. It can be a little hard to follow at times, but nowhere near as bad as it was in Rise of the Lycans, probably because the increased range of the weaponry allowed the camera to pull back a bit (I don't know, I'm just making excuses here). While being the lowest rated movie since the first, the gore is still on point, with Lycans getting slashed in half, spinal chords getting ripped out, and copious amount of bloodletting.The Nordic Vampires were a nice touch and expansion on the lore as well. Initially they seem to come out of nowhere, but there were three elders each with their own covens, but until now we hadn't seen the other two. The Eastern coven (presumably ruled over by Amelia?) is a familiar sight not too dissimilar to Viktors, but the Nordic coven is a breath of fresh air to the black and blue world. The cold and their affinity with death and the other side gives them an otherworldly appearance that pits them closer to fantasy elves. More crucially, they're the basis for Selene getting more superpowers. This is another point I both liked and disliked at the same time. On one hand her new powers are cool, turning her more ethereal and ghostlike, bringing her closer to death than ever before. Her teleportation looks really cool, and plays out quite well for the climatic battle (as underused as it was). But on the other hand, did she really need even more powers? She was already one of the most powerful creatures in existence. The villain stealing her blood, which apparently transfers her abilities to those who consume it, brings them both to an even level (I guess? If resisting sunlight is a superpower now?). But we can't have Selene evenly matched with her antagonist, she has to be above and beyond more powerful, of course, so lets make her super ghostly and give her teleportation! Honestly, I wouldn't be at all surprised if sparkling in the sunlight was her new power in the next movie. Those frosted-tips look simply glamorous though.Acting wise...well Underworld's never been strong with the acting talent, and Blood Wars is no exception. Beckinsale carries the movie as well as she ever has done, at least getting a bit more chance to actually emote this time around. Charles Dance gets way more screentime, but he gets shafted with terrible, expository dialogue almost throughout. Theo James is adequate. Tobias Menzies does do a good Michael Sheen impression. Lara Pulver laps up all the grotesque cheese her villainess requires. But Daisy Head was little more than some googly eyes, and Bradley James had one of the most inconsistent characters to play with.I've had a fair amount of bad things to say about Blood Wars. It tries its very best to feel like the Underworld of old, with Gothic architecture, a focus back on Selene in an unspecified present day, expands the lore, offers plenty of third act revelations. And yet it probably feels the most detached movie of the franchise. Dropping two of the franchise's main characters for no plot-driven reason is its biggest sin, turning it into the Selene show, and none of its many new characters seem to hold all that much relevance to the older movies at all, while simultaneously being told that they absolutely do. They do guys, really, they're relevant, they're connected by centuries just like all the others, despite never once being mentioned or alluded to in previous movies. The action is serviceable, the visuals are serviceable. I mean at absolute worst Blood Wars is still a much more enjoyable movie, and more respectful to the lore, than Awakening ever was. Ultimately though, this isn't my Underworld. This is a knock-off Underworld. A facsimile. I give Blood Wars a strictly average 5/10. Could've been much better, could've been way worse. I still think I'll just stick with the first two movies from now on."
" Simply absurd.
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,2,"This was the fifth film in the ""Underworld"" franchise and marks a new disappointment after the film that precedes it has registered a rather relative qualitative improvement. In fact, if the previous film looks less stylized and seems to make a more consistent bet on the cast's work, this film will make a clean slate of it all. In fact, the feeling I had is that the film even makes a clean slate of everything that happened in the film before and pretends that it never existed: in this film, we hardly hear about the Purge or the wars between immortals and humans, and humans virtually disappear.The action takes place years after the events of the previous film, and they seem to copy a lot of material from the first two films: again, we have an escalation of the war between vampires and a resistant clan of lycans that vampires deemed virtually on the verge of extinction. Again, we see Selene running away to save herself and showing up to save the day in the end, being betrayed (again) by vampires she thought she could trust. That is, the script is so similar to the first two films that it appears to have been chewed and pasted.The film was directed by Anna Foerster, in her first cinematographic work of direction (she had directed other works, essentially episodes of TV series). She proved not to be very experienced but that is not a defect. What is very bad is that she consented to the terrible script that Cory Goodman presented to her. He practically plagiarized the first two films.The cast continues to be led by Beckinsale, but she is not doing any more good here. She is an action figure designed to look sexy, and nothing more. She does not move a muscle and does nothing well. But what shocked me the most was the dubious way in which her character reacts to her daughter's absence... on the one hand she cares and seems determined to protect her but, on the other hand, she shows total emotional detachment. Does not make sense. Theo James is the best actor in this film, and even he has gross flaws on several levels. Charles Dance is good but is removed early, Lara Pulver is uninteresting and Tobias Menzies is histrionic and ends up being misused.Technically, it continues to bet on the incredible action scenes, overwhelming CGI and effects. There is virtually nothing positive that this film can rely on. Cinematography is horrible with the undisputed predominance of blue and gray. Its impressive but it does not move us. Death after death, persecution after persecution, everything just seems absurd."
" Best since Evolution
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,9,"OK so I refused to watch Blood Wars after the terrible Awakening but I've just finished watching it and I was impressed!Yes the CGI still not 100% and I do prefer the costumes over CGI and yes the fight scenes were chopped up but that's what the Americans do I'm afraid, they need to start taking notice how the Indonesians do it or get Gareth Evans to direct the next one but without Kate Beckinsale I highly doubt true fans will watch it?If another one is made then they need to reboot it only not follow it on from this one which tbh ended well. It explained Michael's death and Selene is now the most powerful she's ever been so ending it here would make sense!Shame the runtime wasn't longer than 90min 😭If you like the 1st two Underworlds then you'll love this one. Just a shame they did Awakening and it's a shame Scott Freeman didn't want to come back after Evolution because true fans wanted to see him reprise his role instead of us seeing a CGI Michael and lame story of his death which only got explained in this one which was annoying as we was always lead to believe that he was possibly still alive!!Any way this film is still a solid 8"
" Can these movies get any dumber?
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,3,"At this point, I'm just exhausted and bored with the Underworld franchise. It never feels like they are progressing the story, but they remain planted in the same war between vampire and lycan that has been going on for 4 films already. Underworld: Blood Wars isn't even a strong follow-up chapter, because they write out one of the major characters from the previous film (Selene's daughter) and start to diminish her importance by making Selene just as valuable. The action continues to be bland and dull, and this is the first time in one of these films that I openly laughed out loud during a battle. It was already dumb, but now it's like they're trying to make the use of guns in a war between the undead downright goofy. In the climax of the film there's a face-off between two major characters where they literally shake off dozens of bullets before screaming in each other's faces, and I lost it. I cannot fathom why the characters in these movies continue to arm themselves with ordinary bullets when they keep introducing ammunition that can kill or cripple a vampire or lycan in one shot.Of course, just like the stupidity with the guns, the powers of the creatures also seem inconsistent. I get so annoyed with the way they are knocked down and thrown around by an enemy in one scene, and then they seem to tear through them with the greatest of ease in the next. That's the kind of thing that is indicative of the bad writing that has run throughout the Underworld series, and has pushed my ability to tolerate it too far by the time I landed on Blood Wars. In this movie they also fall into the trap of writing for the sake of convenience. You always know there's something wrong with a script when you introduce a new concept to the mythos of the franchise, and then a mere 10 minutes later the main character is utilizing that information. It's just lazy, and takes me out of the film every time. I also hated how they continued to expand the ""blood memory"" thing to the extreme here. Now, if even a drop of someone's blood hits a vampire's lip, they get flashes of that person's memory. Heck, you can even relive your own past with a bite to themselves. Underworld: Blood Wars has a couple scenes that I liked because they had potential, but otherwise it was a total bust."
" This continues the story but on a meandering path
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,6,"There is not a strong story here and there are questions not well answered (such as, ""What kind of creature is the antagonist?, ""What is this otherworldly spiritual insight thing?"", and ""Why does she not explode from perspiration from wearing that outfit?"").Basically, Selene is pursued by everybody, a few threads are connected, and a portion of the audience remains in awe of how Beckinsale can maintain her svelte figure well into her forties. There is also a faint unconvincing sigh about the story continuing.If you are into the whole Underworld series, this is worth watching. Otherwise, this is just a movie. (What makes me wonder is how they could have turned this into five films while Van Helsing only had one go at ti.)"
" Under rated
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,8,I'm a huge fan I'm quite disappointed that Kate Beckinsale is holding things up for the 6th movie i truly hope the director will continue on even if she's chooses not to there are many directions ilthis can go
" Bloody
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,4,"The underworld franchise took a turn for the worst and I'm glad this was the last in this installment. Even watching for nostalgia wasn't rewarding except maybe a few scenes of Kate Beckinsale im action but other than that it felt like an ambitious action movie lacking in flow. I'm not critical of the story, I was into it but the sequence of events didn't mesh well for me and felt like a giant box of treats where you keep pulling out bad candies but keep expecting for a better one. A strong star cast cannot save this movie."
" It's Kate Beck again but is it!
",2020-03-21 00:00:00,5,Exactly. It's a 5. One memorable fight. One very loose forgettable plot.! one kate beck beck. A lot of bad Halloween in the background of the better vampires.Gonna listen to How Did this Get Made podcast about the film now. Should be fun? Hope I did it in the right order! Ps. I did love Underworld. This just is a solid 5.
" An atrocitious let down
",2020-02-28 00:00:00,1,The film's plot was terrible not to mention how they 'killed' Michael. Ridiculous. Foerrester has potential but she made a terrible mess of the plot of the fifth film. The supposed death of Michael was the worst flaw of the film. A travesty and a betrayal of those of us who really enjoyed Michael Corvin. The effects were excellent and the idea of a new Coven untouched by Kraven and Viktor is a good one but those do not even begin to make up for the blunders in the plot.
" Blood, violence, more blood and violence
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,4,"Blood, violence, more blood and violence, and bloated, blistered and theatrical history."
" Underworld
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,5,"Mindless boring action flick. Great to see Kate Beckinsale in latex again. The action is supe-choppy and sloppily made film. Watch it if you're REALLy into the series, otherwise skip it"
" Not the worst but neither good
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,5,"Underworld: Blood wars is the fifth movie of the franchise and is directed by Anna Forester and stars Kate Beckinsale, Theo James, Lara Pulver, Tobias Menzies and Bradley James.The probably last movie of the franchise disappoints in many ways starting from a weak script to mediocre screenplay and a lazy direction.The director had got a legacy which she failed to do justice. It seems that the movie was trying very hard to upkeep the previous movies and fails.The acting was good but the villain was not as strong and powerful as in the previous movies. The execution was also not that impressive.The movie is a disappointment for the Underworld franchise fans."
" Not very good
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,4,"The story is kinda interesting, but the characters spend the entire movie talking about someone who doesn't even make an apearance, the bad guy gets no backstory, somne characters betray others without really any explanation and the writers apparently forgot that humans discovered lycans and vampires and where hunting them down and could identify them in the last movie, literally no mention of that. Selene gets a power up without explanation, etc.tbh, the movie feels really rushed, a lot of things happen without any explanation, and a lot of characters are introduced out of nowhere."
" Underworld Franchise (2003-2016)
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,5,"Still a better love story than Twilight :DSet (predominantly) in the present day, this fantasy franchise tells us of a centuries-old war between vampires and werewolves. We follow the story from the perspective of Selene (Kate Beckinsale), one of the greatest vampire warriors, who leads the werewolf hunt. When she meets Michael (Scott Speedman), a man who is persecuted by werewolves for a mysterious reason, her life and worldviews change drastically. This saga has quite a well-crafted story and characterization, though as the franchise goes on, the quality of the story declines to eventually turn into a shallow action. The acting, the camera, the directing, the effects, the music ... it's all pretty well done, but nothing spectacular.Underworld (2003)The first film introduces us to the dark world of vampires and werewolves, which secretly coexists with ours. While vampires are a well-organized society with a powerful army, werewolves are a wild unleashed horde that is gradually exterminated by vampires. And then emerges a leader capable of uniting werewolves, as well as a man capable of uniting the features of both races in one hybrid being. A good thriller with a story that will intrigue you, and with just the right amount of romance and well-directed action.7/10Underworld: Evolution (2006)""Evolution"" continues directly to the first movie and now Selene and Michael are trying to break into the history and secrets of both races, in a desperate attempt to bring the centuries-old war to an end. A worthy sequel in the same manner and quality as the first film.7/10Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009)""Rise of the Lycans"" is an ""origins story"" and takes us into the Middle Ages. Vampires were aristocracy, and werewolves were their slaves, until the young werewolf Lucian rose into a leader who led his race in the struggle for liberation, thus beginning a centuries-old war between the two races. The franchise still holds a level.7/10Underworld: Awakening (2012)Humans discover the existence of vampires and werewolves and decide to exterminate them. Michael and Selene are hit while fighting humans and she wakes up twelve years later, not knowing what happened to Michael. She now has a twelve-year-old daughter, the first natural-born hybrid, who she must protect from Lycans that want to take advantage of her in their fight for dominance.The fourth film is slightly weaker than its predecessors. The action continues in the same manner, but the story is underdeveloped. I was under the impression that I was watching a long movie trailer, not the movie itself. But basically, I liked it.6,5/10Underworld: Blood Wars (2016)The latest installment in the ""Underworld"" franchise is by far the worst, but not redundant. ""Blood Wars"" rounds off this saga, but it does a rather lousy job, and the movie is reduced to eighty minutes of shallow action and two-dimensional characters that are there just to keep the story from staying unfinished. I don't want to recommend it, but again, you have to see it if you wish to know how the story ends.5/10"
" Too bad a sixth one is unlikely to be made.
",2019-12-05 00:00:00,7,"""Blood Wars"" does not rely on fighting and shooting a lot. Instead, it focuses on the characters and what happens to them. Even though it ignores certains new and impressive ideas from the previous one, the fifth ""Underworld"" has its own charms.It is honestly easy to talk about the weak spots of it. Like some visual effects that leave much to be desired here and there. This werewolf looks great, that one does not. To avoid excessive detail, let's just say the action scenes vary in their quality. Also, the movie does not start well and suffers in certain parts of the third act. Mostly, because of technical problems.But the cinematography and the story do their job well. Not many movies are so beautiful in spite of happening entirely in darkness. Relaxing, mesmerizing and surprisingly emotional. It's like they hired someone to make an action movie but ended up with a director who cared more about art.That is not to say that you don't get awesome fighting and shooting. You do. The new villain is calm, prepared and strong. Dealing with him is far from easy. I would also like to praise the humor. Where it is, it works. Can't be easy to have funny moments in perilous situations. But that's exactly what we got here.Even though it is only one and a half hour long, it has powerful substance and feels rich in important events. With however many CGI problems to damage your experience, it still feels real. It feels true. Quite a few characters with understandable motivation, life and death decisions, inevitable threats and impressive discoveries."
" Repetitive sequel with Vampire death dealer, Selene struggling to end the eternal war between the Lycan clan and the Vampire faction that betrayed her.
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,5,"UNDERWORLD , BLOOD WARS is a thrilling but so-so sequel dealing with the eternal fight between vampires and werewolves .This creepy and gore-soaked vampires film begins years after . Unknown to humanity, centuries old blood feud raged between aristocrat vampires and subdued legion of werewolves known as Lycans . The tale traces the confrontation between a ruling class of bloodsuckers and their onetime slaves, the werewolves . When human forces discover the existence of the Vampire and Lycan clans , a war to eradicate both species commences. The vampire warrioress Selene leads the battle against Lycans . As a vampire named Selena (Kate Beckinsale) emerges as a powerful rebel who rallies the rebellious bloodsuckers to rise up against vampire traitors . The next installment in the blockbuster franchise, follows Vampire death dealer, Selene as she fends off brutal attacks from both the Lycan clan and the Vampire faction in which she suffered treason . With her only allies, David (Theo James) and his father Thomas (Charles Dance), she must stop the eternal war between Lycans and Vampires, even if it means she has to make the ultimate sacrifice. In the former entry Selene also discovered that she has a 12-year-old Vampire/Lycan hybrid daughter (India Eisley's character is referred to throughout the movie as ""Subject 2"" but credited as ""Eve"") . By the way Selene is joined by David , in his struggle against the Lycans and his fight for freedom . Neverheless , the war was not as it had seemed . Soon the hunt would be on for his killer . As the war between vampires and werewolves get more personal and deadly , they decide to launch a full-scale attack on the hideout in order to extinguish the race. Protect the bloodline.Every bloodline must end.This exciting follow-up, concerns again the eternal taking on between vampires and Lycans . This amazing as well as uneven -though passable- sequel deals with the Vampire death dealer, Selene ; packing frantic action , thrills ride , stirring fighting , graphic violence , excessive body count and being pretty entertaining . The picture continues the characteristic of the series that the major supporting parts are played by well-known actors from the UK, in this case Charles Dance and Lara Pulver . And is the second Underworld film not to feature Bill Nighy, Michael Sheen or Brian Steele . It packs large loads of guts and gore , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense amount , several vampires and werewolves are staked bloodily in the chest, even more impaled with large claws. There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood and numerous get shot up with arcs . Most of vampires, Lycans and humans victims are relegated to being bitten in the throat and neck and the breathtaking fighting scenes are realized with magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department . The film blends horror, suspense , struggles, rip-roaring action, terror and lots of blood and gore . Set design is of first class , settings are stylized, Gothic scenarios , and spooky and ghoulish atmosphere. Special effects are breathtaking , part of them are made by means of computer generator and part by make up . Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score by Michael Wandmacher and colorful as well as dark cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub. Spectacular and moving direction by Anna Foerster . The interesting but mediocre screenplay was written by Len Wiseman , Kate Beckinsale's husband , who directed the former entries , along with Danny McBride and Kevin Grevioux , being based on a story by Cory Goodman. All actors and technicians participated in the previous outings , including , of course , Kate Beckinsale as a relentless action woman , being well replaced by Rhona Mitra in a previous entry titled ¨Rise the Lycans¨. This was Kate Beckinsale's last movie playing the character Selene, but Len Wiseman has confirmed a sixth movie is in development with Beckinsale reprising her character. Support cast is pretty good , such as Tobias Menzies , Lara Pulver , Bradley James , Charles Dance , among others . Recommended to those who amuse those kind of vampires-werewolves films or those enjoy in general.
This box-office franchise is formed by the following ones : Underworld (2003) by Len Wiseman with Beckinsale , Scott Speedman , Michael Sheen , Shane Brolly , Bill Nighy , Sophia Myles , Robbie Gee , Wentworth Miller .

" poor story, bad editing, mediocre plot.... unrealistic events. Seline is immortal.
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,1,"The extreme try to get further money from a sterile franchise just ruined since the pathetic ending in Underworld: evolution. Two of the most powerful Lycan and Vamp killed in so easy way when would be realistic that the usual ""heroes"" were defeated. This movie is a shame for the intelligence of people. Kate Beckinsale in the usual role unable to die even when she dies. A movie made for 3 years old people. The same poor end of Alien franchise... ."
" wth is this garbage?
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,2,"I love the underworld series. let me repeat, i LOVE the underworld series. i rated them in order, 9, 9, 7, 8. Yes, i even loved awakening, it may not have had much of a story but the action was amazing, probably the best in the franchise. so to go into this movie and be completely disappointed is disheartening. i even gave it a second chance and dropped the rating from a 3 to a 2.everything about this movie is bad. the story is complete nonsensical slop. the new elements they introduce are completely out of place. i couldn't get invested in the new characters. and even selene wasn't her usual bad-ass self.but worse than anything are a few technical aspects. the editing was abysmal. i don't normally notice editing when watching movies, but there were a few (non-action) parts that were sooooo bad, i replayed them multiple times. i legit can't believe that these aren't just overlooked mistakes. it makes no sense.another thing i never notice is sound mixing. but there were multiple moments where it just seemed off. the music may be completely drowned out, or the voices are so loud that they seem ""above"" everything else.leaving the worst for last, this is some of the most awful action, not just within this franchise, but that i've ever watched. the amount of cuts during fight scenes was laughable, literally. i couldn't see anything, and i just laughed. and it was too dark to see in many of the scenes. so it was all mind-numbing drivel. whoever is responsible for this, you suck. there are so many examples of well-shot fight scenes, maybe check some of them out before pooping out this nonsense. john wick, daredevil series, everything jackie chan, ip man series, the raid redemption...... even underworld awakening lmao. there is no excuse for this (2 viewings, 1/8/2021)"
" Edmure Tully? Really?

" Decent enough 'vampire & lycan' action in the fifth instalment of this franchise
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,7,"Just in case viewers of forgotten what happened in previous instalments, or not watched them all, this film opens with a brief precis of what happened before. This explains how our protagonist, the vampire soldier Selene has had her daughter hidden somewhere even she doesn't know and how both vampires and lycans are determined to find her as they believe it will help them end the war between the two species.Protagonist Selene is wanted by the lycans, who believe she is the key to finding her daughter and the vampires who what revenge for what she did in a previous film. As the war is going so badly for the vampires she is granted a pardon and invited to help train more vampire soldiers, known as Death Dealers, for the upcoming battle against the lycans who are led by Marius, a smarter than typical lycan. Unfortunately she is betrayed and only survives thanks to the actions of David, the son of a senior vampire... before the film is over they will have to fight both lycans and vampires in a number of battles.Having enjoyed the first three films, but not seeing the fourth, I was glad of the short but effective recap at the start of the film. The story might not be the greatest but it served the purpose of justifying several really impressive fight scenes both between vampires and lycans and between rival vampires. Some of these were one on one or small scale, others were battles with numerous combatants. All of these scenes were pretty exciting and featured good CGI. Selene continues to be a fine protagonist and David provides good support for her; Kate Beckinsale and Theo James are solid in these roles. Vampire Semira and lycan Marius are decent antagonists played by Lara Pulver and Tobias Menzies. Overall a solid enough supernatural action movie; hardly a must see but a fun way to pass an hour and a half if you like the genre."
" Without one of the main characters, again...
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,4,"I waited and hoped for Michael's return throughout the film. Obviously disappointed.
A death that was not up to the character.
Such a watch"
" More of the Same
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,2,"The next instalment in the Underworld franchise delivers more of what we expect, flashy violent action scenes, Kate Beckinsale in tight leather, and unnecessary backtracking through the previous four films. However, it does little for those who aren't devoted to the franchise, and choppy editing combined with a meandering, nonsensical story make for another disappointing instalment in a franchise that is beginning to feel like one big paycheck."
" Dumb
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,1,"One of the dumbest movies I have ever seen.
I was such a fan of the original, the second and the prequel. These last two were completely awful with this one being incredibly dumb and an insult to the franchise."
" not explained clearly.
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,5,"Previous episodes are almost forgotten, leading to the relationship between the characters in this film is really not smooth. Special effects are not prominent, the picture is dim, the plot is scattered, after all, the blockbuster. In the whole article, I can hardly feel any other elements except fighting. The daughter of the woman is just a prop. The parents of the man are so baffled that they have not explained clearly."
" At least Kate still looks mighty fine
",2019-02-11 00:00:00,1,"Underworld: Blood warsLike the Resident Evil franchise the Underworld movies have slowly gotten worse with each instalment.
This latest offering is yet another unimaginative bore.
The only redeeming quality of this franchise is that Kate Beckinsale still looks mighty fine in her costume.
Other than that I lost all interest in this movie within minutes.
As far as story and plot goes it's the same tedious drivel that we have had to endure through in the previous movies.
To be honest I can't even recall what all this nonsense was about because it was just downright boring.
Performances by all are pantomime worthy. It's not even a movie worth using as background noise whilst you cook or wash the dishes.CGI is laughable and although this movie may transfer on to Blu-ray effectively, the higher resolution does the dire special effects no favours.
It's a dark and depressing movie too. Colours rarely pop. A film that may benefit from 4K HDR but to be honest I couldn't be bothered to sit through this snooze fest again to see if HDR makes any difference.Sound is good for the most part but ultimately it is uninspired.
Sure it booms where needed and blades splatter blood with crystal definition but it is nothing that we haven't heard before.
That's the problem with this franchise. It's run its course. Like the Resident Evil movies, each new instalment is just a rehash of what has gone before.
They are films that are made cheaply so they recoup their budget.
None of the film making processes are of a high standard. It's fast food but in movie form.
The trouble is apart from Kate Beckinsale none of this is tasty."
" Better than some but the first is still best
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,7,"I loved the first movie, but much like the Resident Evil movies, the rest have been inconsistent. Kate is a special effect herself, but I haven't liked the look of the werewolves at all. This movie did have a lot of better action scenes than the last few movies, and the story had a few twists, so it's probably my second favourite of the series...though to be honest, I can't remember much of the last few."
" Cheezy and filled with plot holes.
",2019-01-11 00:00:00,1,"The thing that bothered me most about this is the pointless of it all..
Nothing makes sense.
Plot hole after plot hole.
How they become powerful and from whom seems to have no consistency.
I watched the whole film and honestly had more questions than answers at the end.
The villains were weak and without depth at times, and then at others overly powerful without adequate explanation.
The strong characters were only strong when it suited the writers ideas and concepts(which were awful).
Characters had powers or weaknesses that made no sense, especially according to the storyline of the previous installments.
Speaking of the story, it was less than interesting in general.
The characters throughout were often boring, with lame interactions, and frequent cringy moments that inevitably left me with a scrunchie face expression and cuss word or two teetering at the tip of my tongue.
The fight scenes were plentiful, yet no where near captivating and the cgi was less than I had come to expect from a Underworld movie.
I absolutely loathed this movie from beginning to end.
..not that the series what perticularly amazing to begin with, but it was at least entertaining before.
This sequel certainly didn't do any justice to its reputation.
Everyone involved should be ashamed and embarrassed of the end result.
I would be.

" Fans of the first two will HATE this.
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,3,"Loved the first two. The prequel had its faults but still good. The 4th one was blah but still enjoyable and made it seem like this one will bring back a lot of great things, so we'll let it pass. But it didn't. It mislead us. This one is pushing its luck... and our patience. Why bother making another one without Michael? Or even Eve? Killing him off was stupid. Couldn't they get the actor/s back for a family reunion? This film was sloppy. Horrible plot, screenplay and directed like a low budget film.... even lower than the originals. I was so disappointed and disgusted with this. Capitalizing on the original story and characters. Beckinsale shouldn't have starred in this. This is a pathetic excuse for a movie. The franchise is dead and the story has been ruined by bad sequels. What could have been an excellent franchise, has been given to an inexperienced and untalented team. Don't bother watching this if you're a fan. It broke my heart."
" Kate the vamp babe returns. I enjoyed, so will you.
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,7,"Nowhere near as bad as people are saying here. It's not as good as the first three but it is still a fun action fun, vampires and lycans movie.
My one real gripe is that it all felt a bit rushed. The war could have been grander and paced better. Probably producers interfering wanting a commercial easy run time.
The makers of this franchise have lost the feel of the first film. The first Underworld borrowed heavily from other films like The Crow and The Matrix and that was what made it so cool. It was dark gothic scenery and matrix style action moves and slow motion. Kate looking incredible helped also. I miss that kind of underworld.
Second time I've watched and was even better each viewing. Kate still looks incredible. I'd love to see another film.Switch brain off and enjoy it for what it is, a fantasy horror action film. And it delivers that in droves."
" Len Wiseman should have directed them all!
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,3,"I am a HUGE Underworld fan; so let's be honest, Underworld 1 and 2 were the TOTAL best out of all the movies; I thought Patrick did a great job with Rise of the Lycans too and although Wiseman was involved in some way on all the other films he did not direct them and that is where this franchise went wrong and where many tend to go wrong as well such as with the X-Men films. Len Wiseman should come back and remake those 2 bad underworld films over, and bring scott speedman back too, bring back the girl who played Amelia maybe idk some substantial storyline but not this Hollywood plot thirsty sell out stuff."
" Underworld: flogging a dead horse
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,5,"Quite a lazy instalment in the series. Visually it's fine, and it has some good set pieces, but the plot is unconvincing and it just seems like a cash-in on the popularity of the earlier films (and if you haven't seen them, this won't make much sense at all)."
" Pretend it doesn't exist
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,3,"BLOOD WARS ranks alongside RISE OF THE LYCANS as the worst yet in the UNDERWORLD franchise. We're stuck in a perenially murky grey/blue world of digital filmmaking, where various vampires and werewolves strive for domination and kill off their rivals. A tired old plotline is bolstered by lots of boring fight scenes which may the key mistake of replacing human fighters with CGI stunt people, like Del Toro did in BLADE II back in the day; the end result is less engaging than even a video game. Kate Beckinsale walks through the thing without a single expression; she's either bored by the whole thing, or has had so much plastic surgery than she can no longer move any of her facial muscles. Genuine actors like Charles Dance and Tobias Menzies are utterly wasted. My advice? Pretend this doesn't exist."
" Dire cash in.
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,5,Terrible dial in acting and weak script ham string an already abysmal plot.
" Another Expected Chapter
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)This is basically a build up for a Vampire and Lycan rumble. The story quickly gets into vampires gearing up for a massive attach by Lycans, who are seeking the powerful blood of Selene's daughter, in hiding, which once located will enable them to become unstoppable. Vampire recruits begins to train up and fortify their covenant. But one of the vampire factions Selene teams up with has ulterior motives and a long historical memory knowing her blood is very valuable as well. One female vampire in particular, not only has a thirst for blood but for power and status. With few allies, will she be able to survive? Overall, you get what you expect. blood splattering, swords and assorted weapons slashing, some decent action scenes with a fine story."

Incredibly bad story filled with plot holes, really bad effects (especially in the fighting scenes, which have always been one of the best parts of this series) and terrible directing... It seems as though the director would rather have made a war movie than one with supernatural creatures - why else would there be so many guns involved and no proper fighting between creatures...It has sadly dropped to B-film status in my opinion... I think they should just have stopped after the third film instead."
" Has it started yet?
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,2,"What a disappointment. Repeats and repeats snipers from previous episodes, adding maybe 5 minutes of actual plot. The entire purpose of this film was to lay the platform for yet another sequel down the road. But they forgot to make this episode work first. The worst episode by a long, long distance. What a wasted opportunity."
" A drop in quality
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,6,"Finished watching Underworld Blood Wars. I've always enjoyed the series despite them not really being great films. If you are a fan of the previous films this installment provides enough vampire badassery to not disappoint. The story is a bit convoluted though, even for a series where story has always been secondary to action. Overall a 6 out of 10."
" More of the same. If you like the previous films, you'll like this one.
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,6,"Kate Beckinsale is compulsively watchable in this tale of Matrix-like vampires in their eternal war with luddite werewolves. Director Anna Foerster delivers slickly executed action sequences just as well as the original film's director (Beckinsdale's real-life ex-husband) Len Weisman. The fight sequences are quite good, even if they're not at the same level of Yuen Woo Ping's fight sequences in the Matrix films or as inventive as those in the John Wick films, but really, how many films at are those levels of awesomeness? Although I've never cared for the humorlessness and rather ponderous mythology of this franchise, which primarily seems to be an excuse to get to the next slow-motion gunfight and hand-to-hand fight sequence, I do really like the Underworld series. Most franchises by this time (this is the fifth in the series) can get bogged down by their own ever growing backstory, but series creator and producer Weisman manages to keep this story of high-tech vampires vs. low-tech werewolves interesting and never straying too far from it's original key story elements. Overall, if you enjoyed the previous films, you'll like this one too."
" 50 minutes of nothing - real movie starts at 51st minute into the film
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,5,"I am a hardcore fan of the Underworld series but missed this film when it came out in the cinema and only caught up on it now due to life related matters.That worked out for the best though as this movie is quite disappointing. Having watched it at home I was quite shocked to see I made it 50 minutes into the film and not much happened; no action, no plot development, no character development and hardly any character introduction. Which is silly because this movie introduces a whole range of new characters - if they were really going to waste the first 50 minutes of the movie they could have at least used it to introduce the new characters.The issue with this film overall is just that it is made in poor quality - what I mean by this is that every element of the film is just poor. The special effects, choreography (there was literally a scene in the film where two characters stood absolutely still swimming their swords forward non stop for a solid 3 minutes...), the acting, the music and the cinematography, the dialogue and the screenplay. Literally every element of what makes a film good was horrendous in this film.This film also messes with a lot of what previous films have established - the older the vampire the more powerful yet in this film some very elder vampires were killed like nothing by some very young ones. It just makes no sense in terms of what previous films already established.To summarise; bad plot, poor acting, boring action sequences and even though this is a fantasy film with vampires and werewolves it abandons the logic of the franchise and goes completely into the realm of nonsense.Then again this is definitely a franchise that seems to get worse as they make more sequels. I just hope they make one final sequel and give it the quality it deserves and let the franchise end on a positive note."
" Time to end it.
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,2,"I was not particularly impressed with this installment. It felt as if the entire film was based on a single scene, stretched to a 91-minute film. The film solely revolves around ""finding the girl"". This would have been a good time to bring Michael (Scott Speedman) back in the story. It seems there is no more to tell in the series and I hope this is the last installment. End it."
" ""Underworld: Blood Wars""- A mildly entertaining but ultimately mediocre installment in the long-running franchise. A solid script is let down by a weirdly uneven execution.
",2018-05-26 00:00:00,5,"While never quite becoming a massive mainstream success, the long running and generally popular cult-franchise ""Underworld"" has for the most part been a great deal of fun to follow for the past decade-and-a-half. With its trademark gothic visuals and a flare for top-notch action, the ongoing saga about the battle between vampires and werewolves has remained consistently entertaining and engaging, even as it's gotten progressively sillier with each new installment.Unfortunately, after the films reached a surprisingly pleasing crescendo in quality with the third installment ""Rise of the Lycans"", there was a noticeable dip in quality with the follow-up, ""Awakening."" It began to lose sight of why audiences fell in love with the series in the first place. And that downward trend does sadly continue in the newest chapter- ""Underworld: Blood Wars."" While by no means a terrible film, the fundamental issue with ""Blood Wars"" falls on one key issue- guidance. It boasts a pretty good story and some solid writing... but is drastically let down by a weirdly awkward and frankly clunky execution.Kate Beckinsale returns as former Death Dealer Selene, now on the run with her friend and ally David, played again by Theo James. After being betrayed by power-hungry vampire heiress Semira (Lara Pulver), Selene and David are forced to take refuge with a clan of Nordic Vampires hiding out in the arctic. Here, they will come across revelations that could hold the key to turning the tide of the war between vampires and werewolves. But it may not be enough, as both species have become woefully misguided and bloodthirsty from centuries of pointless war, and been driven to the point of near extinction...First things first, as always the cast is pretty darned solid. Beckinsale is as fiery and fierce as ever in her iconic role as the vampire assassin Selene, and I actually really enjoyed Theo James and how he handled the character of David this time around. Charles Dance brings a sense of class and gravitas in his returning role of Thomas, and we get a pretty good turn from Tobias Menzies as a Lycan lord named Marius. Menzies, best known for his roles in series like ""Game of Thrones"" and ""The Crown,"" does well with the part and gives it a nice sense of menace, even if he's never really the main focus. The same cannot be said for Lara Pulver, however, who comes across as, well... a bit silly as the vampire villainess Semira. She plays the role as a spoiled brat, and it feels contrived and at odds with the other performances.Writing duties are handled by series newcomers Cory Goodman and Kyle Ward, and I actually for the most part felt that they were a good fit. Their combined credits include a slew of odd and unusual films, and it benefits the story, which takes many intriguing twists and turns I might not have expected otherwise. Particularly fascinating is the addition of the Nordic vampire tribe, which have their own unique methodology and temperament... almost feeling more akin to spiritual monks than traditional blood-suckers. It gave the franchise a fresh new perspective that hearkened back to the originality of prior films, and was very much needed after the tonal inconsistencies of the previous installment.Unfortunately, the film falls apart all too often due to the mixed efforts of director Anna Foerster, in her feature-film debut. Foerster, whom has worked on a number of high profile films in the past as a cinematographer and effects artist, sadly isn't able to muster much excitement nor style with her first major foray into filmmaking. Her sense of scope and composition is limited and stilted, and the sense of pacing she constructs is so manic as to be distracting. The film moves far too fast for its own good, and lacks a clear focus on narrative and character. Foerster knows how to block a scene technically... but not how to convey emotion or story within that scene. It's almost heartbreaking, because she doesn't slow down enough at all to allow us to take in the sights, the feelings, etc. She's just too pre-occupied on hitting beats and checkmarks. And it tanks almost every major sequence. With the exception of the admittedly well-staged action and a very fun climax, it's just woefully not well made.It's frankly mind-boggling how the poor pacing and construction almost completely ruins what could have otherwise been a pretty decent entry in the series. And it just goes to show you how invaluable series co-creator Len Wiseman was to the success of those early installments.""Underworld: Blood Wars"" is a frustrating film. It has so much potential, but squanders much of it with its uneven and shoddy execution. And it only lessened my excitement for potential future films. My advice? Bring back Beckinsale and the series creators Wiseman and Danny McBride for one last film... hopefully one that will redeem the series after the weaknesses brought about by the one-two punch of ""Awakening"" and ""Blood Wars."" Go out with a bang, guys. Otherwise, ""Underworld"" might very well be finished. I'm giving ""Blood Wars"" a middle of the road 5 out of 10. It's just creative and entertaining enough to be worth a watch for series fans. But it's thus far the weakest of the bunch."
" Almost as good as the first
",2018-05-24 00:00:00,9,This movie was a surprise. Went in with low expectations but came away with anticipation for the next one. Very entertaining with lots of action.
" More vampire vs werewolf shenanigans
",2018-05-15 00:00:00,7,"The 5th film in the Underworld franchise sees the Vampires and Lycans more at odds than ever. Selene is outlawed, everyone wants to find her pure-crossbreed daughter Eve in order to use her blood to establish control, and they think they can do this via Selene (who actually doesn't know where Eve is). The vampires have political machinations going on between rival factions, and the Lycans, led by Marius and having grown strong, are preparing to mount an invasion. Complicated, innit?Like the previous 4 movies, the distinguishing characteristics of this movie are a) a muted blue/grey colour palette, b) lots of slo-mo cartoon CGI blood spraying all over the place, c) masses of slo-mo violence, b) the odd respected thespian adding a spurious note of gravitas, d) a plot full of complexities which hide a threadbare storyline which can be summed up as ""vampires vs werewolves"" (see also episodes 1 to 4), and e) Kate Beckinsale in spray-on leather. It must be admitted that, as ever, Kate Beckinsale's bum, lovingly caressed by shiny skin-tight leather, is almost worth the price of a cinema ticket on its own.There is, thankfully a recap at the start so that those who have forgotten the previous movies are brought back up to speed. This manages to include most of the money shots from the earlier films viz half of Bill Nighy's head sliding off etc.Otherwise, it suffices only to note that virgin director Anna Foerster, taking the place of Beckinsale's now ex-husband Len Wiseman, satisfactorily delivers the mixture as expected - political shenanigans, blood, bad CGI, and grim atmosphere.Lara Pulver wears several costumes which reveal rather more Lara Pulver than costume. This is a Good Thing.Oh, and there is a bloody great unanswered question. I'm not going to say what it is, that would be a spoiler, but you'll be saying exactly what one of the lead characters says - ""But I saw...."" The ending makes it clear that the answer will be found in the next film. Which leads me to say, ""I've been fiddled!"""
" Underworld: Blood Wars has sucked all the blood out of this franchise.
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,4,"A fifth instalment and the series continues to grow more convoluted and formulaic with every new entry. Whilst acknowledging the hideous reviews this garnered, I was expecting the worst of the worst. Yet, surprisingly, I found this to be somewhat enjoyable. Maybe the declination of this franchise has melted my critical hypothalamus, or perhaps the silly entertainment was enough to occupy my mind. Regardless, this was fine. Selene is recruited by one of the last remaining covens to train new members in becoming Death Dealers. Double-crossing, tainted aspirations and an increase in convolution aids the ever raging war between vampires and lycans. The exact same formula is utilised much like with the previous entries. Selene hides from both races, a new antagonist arises and desires Selene's blood, a third act final battle and then finally leaving the story open for another sequel. Uninspired? Yes. Functional? Sure. Blood is thicker than this expositional narrative which lacks any sense of characterisation. There is not a single line of dialogue that has an ounce of personality. The vampire ancestry expands for no apparent reason other than to confuse you even more. The over reliant clunky CGI detracts from the authentic creature design and prosthetics that the Underworld franchise excelled at. The constant flashbacks, acting as archival footage, were jarring and a lazy method to convey exposition. However, and I can't believe I'm saying this, it was ever so slightly better than 'Awakening'. Beckinsale owns the role of Selene yet again. Dance actually had a sword fight this time! Pulver's campy antagonistic execution was a much required element given the abysmal villain in the previous film. The action sequences were filmed well without relying too heavily on effects and quick cuts. Bloody and gory with many *cue Mortal Kombat voice* fatalities! Let's be honest though, Blood Wars is not a good film...but I was never bored. Enough is enough though, no more please."
" Pure amusement
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,8,"I just binged the whole Underworld movie series and enjoyed it enormously. I don't know why so many people give bad reviews about Blood Wars though. This kind of movie (just like the other four) is not about deep human relationships, serious topics, etc. When you watch this, you know what you are in for; fantasy/horror entertainment with a lot of action, blood and all kinds of evil and betrayal. It's as good as any other sequel in this series.
You like vampires, Lycans, hybrids, Originals,... then this is still one of the best vampire movies on the market."
" The franchise has jumped the lycan
",2018-01-26 00:00:00,5,"I've always been a fan of the 'Underworld' franchise. The first film totally blew me away and - amazingly - the sequel (in my opinion, anyway) was that rarest of beasts of a sequel that was actually better than the original. Yes, a few people said the prequel that came next was a missed opportunity, as it didn't address a lot of the mythology that people were hoping for. And, despite many film critics absolutely despising the fourth instalment, I took some dumb enjoyment out of the affair. Therefore, I couldn't really see how 'part 5' would be anything other than more of the same silly, action-packed entertainment. I was wrong. Sadly.I just couldn't believe how much the quality has fallen with this one. It just felt like one of the most generic, by-the-numbers films ever made. Yes, it had some of the same characters in it. Yes, Kate Beckinsale looked good in her catsuit. And, yes, there are still plenty of action scenes. Yet, this time round, it just didn't feel like anything other than an extended trailer for a film.Although Kate Beckinsale does her best in the lead, this time round she seems almost bored to be here - like other roles have dried up and she needs this one to pay the bills. The other characters are equally forgettable; there's a new vampire who basically looks like the 'Mother of Dragons' from 'Game of Thrones' and (yet another) new leader of the werewolves (sorry, 'lycans') who just snarls in a menacing manner and even the - normally great - Charles Dance can't really add any old-school charm to the proceeding. However, when I sat down to watch this, I was hardly expecting major character development and meaningful story arcs - I would have settled for some decent vampire versus werewolves action. I didn't even get that! The action scenes are possibly some of the worst ever in modern movies. Twenty years ago they might have been considered something special, but times have changed and people are expecting something a little different. But, again, I could have taken dull action - what I really got was 'stupid' action! If you think about any of the major fight scenes they make no sense whatsoever. The characters do things that are so ridiculous that it makes all those old horror films where the blonde leading lady doesn't bother killing the killer when she has the upper hand absolutely believable and inspired. I've never seen a more poorly-trained army of vampires who gets wiped out like they're 'normal' humans. I suppose at least they don't 'sparkle' in sunlight.On the plus side, it does shed some light on some questions raised in previous instalments regarding characters who just - sort of - disappeared from the franchise, but apart from that, there's really not much here that you haven't seen before. I hear there's an 'Underworld 6' in the pipeline - I'll probably watch it, but this instalment has severely lowered my expectations towards the franchise."
" Only for fans and few other people
",2018-01-20 00:00:00,6,"The 2017 has marked a great success for several films, ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" is not among them (film produced in 2016 but distributed in many countries, including the US, in 2017).
It does not take much to understand why the film has recorded anything exciting at the box office, unfortunately the saga had already begun to weaken with the fourth episode and the need and the request from the public for another chapter it had decreased a lot, only the fans of the saga remained, but not everyone.
But as the film is really bad on many aspects such as: a confused direction, a nauseating montage, special effects of low-level and a script that adds little to the genre and the saga, and does that little in a trivial and superficial; although this is extremely evident, some of these problems have also characterized the other chapters, I can only be honest and admit that I was in any case liked for the simple fact that I enjoyed watching it, because the film, like the others of the saga, manages to entertain through the adrenaline action sequences with significant choreography and a lot of violence that leads to so much blood that, in a film of this type, never hurts.
In addition, after five films I must say that I have also been keen on the characters and the world around them.
In short, it is the worst, together with the fourth, of ""Underworld"", a saga that I would almost define my guilty pleasure, but it remains one of them, so always fun, violent and as ugly as beautiful."
" Pitch Black
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,7,"Good franchise. Good movie. Good actors. Good acting. In this installment: terrible cinematography. They were very heavy-handed with their filters. The blue tint to everything is acceptable, but then they used very high contrast and then darkened the heck out of every frame of the movie. I first saw this in a theater and I assumed the projectionist was running the projector at about 60% brightness. I hoped buying the Blu-ray would deliver the true picture. Turns out, the movie *really* is dark. Too dark. Way too dark. Every vampire in the coven was wearing 100% black outfits. Put them in a candle lit room with black walls and curtains and darkened filters and you end up with blue/white faces seemingly floating around! So frustrating. Even the photo that Netflix uses for this movie (DVD cover) is far brighter than any image in the entire movie. Maybe they should have called this movie: Pitch Black. Oh wait, that's already been used."
" for a shrinking fan base
",2017-12-20 00:00:00,3,Death dealer Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is alone in the world. Michael is long gone. Their daughter Eve is hidden away even from Selene herself. Both Lycans and Vampires are after her. Vampire David (Theo James) comes to her aid against the Lycans and she saves his life. The Eastern Coven is losing against the Lycans and Semira (Lara Pulver) argues to reinstate Selene as leader of the new untrained Death Dealers.The franchise first started going downhill with Michael being written off. There is a Romeo and Juliet aspect to the first movie that is missing from all the rest. It's a good thing to start with a previously segment to bring some of it back since I've forgotten most of the convoluted history. The franchise is running on fumes. It feels very repetitive. This is playing to an ever shrinking fan base and nobody else. People who haven't followed the movies have no reason to watch this.
" Excellent movie, I don't understand the 5.8 rating on here at all.
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,7,"This was a very good addition to the franchise. It did a great job of tying up a lot of loose ends in the plot from the previous installment and, as always, the story/adventure was quite good with some excellent acting all around. No, it's not a romcom, nor is it a romdram and it's not meant to be either of those. This is a combat/adventure movie with some mild political intrigue thrown in as a backdrop to the war between the Werewolves (lycans) and the Vampires. It's not sparkly vampires and fluffy werewolves from twilight. These are your classic badguys in a war with one another. The story was great, the acting was pretty solid as well and... Kate was amazing as always. Great movie, far better than the 5.8 average it's sporting right now."
" A weak swan song?
",2017-11-17 00:00:00,5,"Funny how my hopes were low going into this film but it starts off pretty darn good - at least into the first half of it. But then the film adds super-saiyan vampires, roid raging werewolves and a boringly convoluted plot and yeah - I checked out. I must say I was a little disappointed because the Underworld series as more or less have had consistently good B-level action flicks. Whatever, it couldn't last forever because what's her name is playing a character who doesn't age while she is starting to age, because she is of course only human."
" Chemistry Missing between Vamp Stars
",2017-10-30 00:00:00,3,"Hi Readers. Yet, another Underworld story for the vampire genre. When will it ever end. Let's move on, something a little less jaded, perhaps a movie about ghosts that don't even staze their hauntees because their heads are covered in a sheet, OOps that's been done. Lots of black outfits here, although there's some contrast with the white haired members of a northern coven. Is black the new orange, or is orange the new black. Yeah, well you won't be getting much psychoanalysis in this one, except for a sidekick to Beckinsale's character who, surprise, surprise is heir unapparent to the coven's title of jester, no, lord master - I think it is. And the ensuing jealous/zealous battle for the coveted leadership of the coven gets interrupted with a subplot about lichens (not the moss, the werewolves, though they're about on the same par, to me) coming to get revenge - I think or just eliminate/exterminate their rivals (for what, I don't recall). Yeah, this one could use some real backstory, not the ""oh, the backstory is in the previous installment, and to prove that here's some clips vis a vis, the MC's delirium. Thanks, there's better horror out there, with bigger stars than Beckinsale, though not as fresh from the can or is it called DRAM, these days?"
" Holy crap what a bunch of silliness!
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,1,"THis Underworld cgi action crap gives the genre a really bad name. Think that i enjoyed the two first Underworld, Even though It wasn't for bullet time action or cgi werewolf transformations, they had some great FX and the original was balanced.. Now look at this???! Every vampire running around with Machine guns and looking ridiculous! I don't recommend this garbage to anyone!"
" EXCELLENT story, production, acting, effects, editing...
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,10,"To all of you super-critical reviewers, I want to know: Where is YOUR movie, your acting, your EVERYTHING that I mentioned in my summary. Now, I've seen the previous movies, and this one surpassed them. Yeah, I'd rather see Scott Speedman, but Theo James was excellent. Everything and everyone was excellent. Great production values in a well-thought-out showcase for movie production geniuses, and a very good time for people who just like movies with plenty of action and nifty effects. For me, all of the dialogue was meaningful, and so were the very creative plot points, and all those MEANINGFUL and THOUGHTFUL little edits. I totally loved it, and I know it made BIG money."
" Bore-wars
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,1,"This movie is complete crap. Obviously low budget, as there is almost no action at all. And what little action there is, is boring. The story is boring with horrible acting. Actors not reacting at all to surprising news, actors saying their lines way too fast with no pause and mumbling at the same time. Believe me this gets annoying after a while. In other words wooden acting that is even worse than in the Star Wars prequels. But its not the actors fault. Its the inept director Ann Foersters fault. Except for Theo James, whom I suspect couldn't act convincingly even if his very life depended on it. The way he speaks with a very low deep mumbling voice is really annoying. Whats most astonishing is that Len Wiseman produced this and Charles Dance who played the evil Tywin Lannister on Game Of Thrones is in this movie. Why he agreed to be in this movie I don't get. And of course Kate Bekinsale as Selene. And yet it still sucks. And as I said before the prettyboy Theo James who is once again replacing Scott Speedman as the leading man, should consider a careerchange and become a model. Because apart from his pretty face, he has about as much personality as a doormat. And this annoying douchebag is more worried about looking good, than fighting convincingly in actionscenes. And he doesn't look good. He just looks like the moron he is. If you're an Underworld fan, avoid any movie made after the two original movies. The following movies are just that terrible. The first two movies had good acting, great plots, the love-story between Michael and Selene and great action. Everything every movie after the second installment has lackedIm done with this franchise. As you will probably be as well, after trying to watch this."
" Its all about Lycans vs Vamps (Most Beautiful Vamp)
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,4,"The next chapter of the Underworld series brings you 1:31 hours of war sequence. The war among the races of Vampires and the Lycans. It story- line has been crafted just to link and to reveal the mysteries left in the prequels. The visual effects does not catch much attraction as these are filmed in violet/night scenes. The performances remains ordinary yet Selene (Kate) looks damn gorgeous as Vamp. The characters could have been more complex and more fascinating to watch. Overall, it is entertaining for those who love the Underworld franchise but it is just a masala movie."
" Undistinguished entry in the vampire vs. werewolf sweepstakes
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,4,"""Underworld: Blood Wars"" is the fifth installment in a franchise that began way back in 2003. Nearly 15 years in, the series has devolved into little more than a rote, by-the-book enactment of all the vampire vs. werewolf silliness that has permeated pop culture in the period since. The only point of interest, while watching the endless battles that flesh out the script, is trying to figure out why a bunch of vampires and werewolves need to rely so heavily on high-tech weaponry and advanced firepower. Kinda defeats the purpose of being a supernatural being, doesn't it?Kate Beckinsale, Theo James and Lara Pulver take center stage in the drama, while Charles Dance and James Faulkner, two seasoned actors who look and sound as if they should be performing Shakespeare on some London or Broadway stage, really seem to be slumming it here. Hard to resist the pull of an easy paycheck, I guess."
" I've already killed you once
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,8,"The film opens with outcast death dealer Selene (Kate Beckinsale) catching us up with a few sentences with the rest following. The werewolves who are called Lycans because that sounds more sophisticated, are planning a major attack at the Vampire fortress. They want the blood of the hybrid Eve, daughter of Selene so they can be strong and win. I still don't fully understand the blood doping rules, or how memory is retained in the blood, but I just went with it. Selene is granted amnesty by the Vampires (she killed Victor in a previous movie) in order to train new recruits for the up and coming battle.Of course these films are never just vampires vs werewolves, oh excuse me, Lycans, with me selling silver bullets to both sides. It is a twisted tale with betrayal and let's add a new element just as I am getting the old plot sorted out. OUCH! Plenty of fighting. The plot tries to be clever, and maybe it was. Leaves it open for at least a few more episodes as this appears to be a bridging film which promises what this one missed.Guide: No nudity. 1 F-word. Brief sex."
" The mission Eve has begun!
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,4,"Like any guys from before the 90s, I was too a big fan of Beckinsale. There's no one can match her beauty, even to her age of today. That does not mean all her films are good. She has stopped doing good films a while ago. Every time when her films get released, I was hoping for her comeback like the old days, either a pure drama or an action film. No, not this film. It is what, the fifth in the franchise and the feature film debut for the directress of the television series.As always, worth watching for Kate. The story continued, and it focused on the remaining vampires fighting for their survival against their arch-rival, Lycans. That's where the Selene caught between. But this time, it was about looking for her daughter, Eve, who holds the key to the future of these immortals. So the action begins where everybody clashes, racing towards their destination.The first three were the good ones. This and the previous ones were downgraded the decent series. The makers are already working on the sixth. Definitely not expected, after seeing this particular film. But I hope it comes back to the original course with good story, actions, graphics and all. This was simply based on one liner, and the rest of the film leaned towards the stunt sequences. Okay to watch once, but I'm not sure worth of spending 90 minutes for it. So if you want to, then it is good to keep update to follow when the time comes to try the next ones.4/10"
" If you liked the previous films, why not enjoy this one also?
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,8,"I don't get all the critical hate for this movie. What did anyone expect? It's frickin' Kate Beckinsale in latex!!! What could be better? This is terrible to admit, but I would pay Redbox $1.50 to watch Kate Beckinsale cook breakfast if she was dressed in her latex catsuit. But this movie is frickin' awesome! Sword hacking, vampires flying around, werewolves transforming into monsters, and (spoiler) Kate gets resurrected and comes back with frosty tips and new magic powers. I almost didn't watch this because of all the bad reviews, but it's the same old greatness as all the other films. Keep them coming! Kate Beckinsale is 43 years old and never looked better, plus she kicks @$$ with Euro ultra-violence. When (spoiler) Semira (Lara Pulver) gets stabbed through her mouth from behind as she enjoys the sun for the first time was almost as great as the ending as Kate says ""I have lived for a thousand years, and I may live a thousand more..."" I hope she does. :)"
" Wasted Acting
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,3,"The story line doesn't continue where it left off, which only makes you think that the role was declined to those in the last film. The storyline veers off the entire script and brings new characters to incorporate a whole new story. For that, the producer should have just created another movie instead of mutilating a great story they had going.Very disappointing."
" Underrated Underworld.
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,8,"I really liked this latest installment to the Underworld franchise. As a matter of fact, I like them all, but I really loved the new setting in this one. The directing, writing, cinematography/VFX were all top notch. Kate Beckinsale and Theo James were once again incredible in their roles, as was the rest of the cast. The special effects though were very well done and more evident in this film more so than previous films. It's an 8/10 from me!"
" Epic fail to awaited installment of dwindling series
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,4,"(if you have not seen the installments of the Underworld series yet, then here is a *spoiler alert warning*)I have been a fan of the underworld series since it very first started out back in 2003. the first installment was really good. It set the pace for what would be perceived (at that point) as an up and coming great series..it carried the very essence of its title..Underworld. the title alone says dark and dangerous. and that's how it started... it also finished with a great fight scene a hint towards unknown origin information and an introduction to a new version of an existing character(Hybrid Micheal Corvin). After the very first underworld, the series should have continued with the ""Rise of the Lycans"" (personally rise of the Lycans should have been first) but Anyhoo) After seeing the very first underworld and the introduction of Lucius' and Victor's character, it should have went to the Rise of the Lycans installment to explain both origins and how they came to be in power of their coven/den.. Based on how ""Rise of the Lycans"" played out, the next installment should have shown the aftermath of that battle, with an in movie flashback about Victor rising to the throne. Also it should've introduced Kraven's character and how he and Lucius came to be in league with one another( *explaining Lucius' arm skin with Victor's branding in the vampire book*) Which would have closed out explaining how Kraven became in charge of the coven...prior to the introduction of our beloved heroine Selene😍..finishing the installment with a glimpse of Selene's Rise under Victor's rule and amongst the rankings of the Death Dealers... Then should have came the Original Underworld.(actually Kraven and Lucius' arrangement should have been flashed back at the moment it was known (in Underworld 1) that they were in cahoots) As for UW2(should've tweaked the story line better)..this installment was all over the place..other than stating their origins, Marcus, William, and even Alexander Corvinus' roles weren't introduced with any real relevance..and then to make matters worse than that..following the next installment (rise of the Lycans (best installment,then the original..my opinion)) They kill off one of the main characters (Hybrid Micheal Corvin) who has the overall best potential (He had Elite Blood from the the father of both Clans,he was bitten by hybrid Lucius, and given Selene/Victor's blood! We never got to see him reach anything remotely close to his Hybrid potential...s.m.h.. Then comes a Hybrid Kid!.😮. then came whatever concept they tried to pull off with Blood Wars!.. I could go on an on, but my break is about over.. so enclosing, As much as I've enjoyed Kate Beckinsale/Selene in skin tight clothing😍😍, Her character,although the lead, should not have been the sole bases of the installments that followed after the Rise of the Lycans. Their Hybrid family adventures should have at least spanned through two installments... Micheal Corvin's character was a major part of the arc..His character deserved better than some cheesy excuse about how he met his demise.. Bottom line, I don't know what Scott Speedman's conditions were to continue playing the part of Micheal ""The Hybrid"" Corvin ...but some kind of agreement should have been met to maintain the continuity and integrity of this failing series (my opinion)..Maybe Len didn't like him constantly rehearsing the love scenes with his wife..hmm..j/k..(although that was crass to say, i had to say it ...Here lies yet another original concept doomed to failure because of Fan Based Hype..First the Fat Boys break up, now this..😩😂😂 Next you'll tell me that Comic Book movies are made and tailored towards a generation that has never even read the original story lines..😂😂😂 good day everyone..this was fun.."
" very scary
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,10,This a very scary movie. Underworld is scarier. Underworld Evolution is scarier. Underworld rise of the l.y.c.a.n.s is scarier. Underworld Awakening s is scarier. But still this a very scary movie. It has great acting. It also has a great story line. 5.8 is a good ratting. But this is such a great movie that 5.8 is underrating it. This is a 10 out of 10. It has great special effects. This is scarier then The Shining and that is not easy to do. This is scarier then The silence of lambs could ever be. This is scarier then Psycho and that is not easy to do. This is one of the scariest movie from 2016. See it. It is a great horror movie. It is very scary. It is a must see.
" Many Bad Reviews
",2017-07-07 00:00:00,10,"First, I had seen the four other in Underworld franchise. I should have avoided the the reviews as they ruined it. But, I do not watch bad movies twice, so there you go. Waiting to see Eve return in #6. Again, I very much enjoyed watching it again. I think there was money paid out for those bad reviews. And for pity's sake if you've got it in for this genre, tell that to editor or if none, the public."
" Kate Beckinsale Must Be A Vampire
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,9,"Underworld is one of the most underrated action film series. Even though the sequels open with a synopsis, you have to watch all the movies in succession to fully understand and appreciate the storyline. The third film, Rise Of The Lycans, was a prequel. The fourth one, Awakening, was okay, but this fifth installment, Blood Wars, with a different writer-director team reminds more of the first three films that I enjoyed the most. Kate Beckinsale still looks fantastic for her age. Or she could be a real vampire. I look forward to the next chapter in Underworld."
" Quite okay
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,8,"I think it is fairly safe to say that if you did not like any of the other installments in the Underworld movie series then you will not like this one.As usual with these kind of movies it is one where you preferably switch of most higher brain functions before watching and just sit down and enjoy the show. The movie is certainly not a masterpiece when it comes to story and script. Actually the script is, at times, fairly crappy. There are for example a sequence were the Lycans are attacking the stronghold castle of the Vampires and the script writer taught it was a good idea to just let them drive straight into the center of the castle and breach the door before they got challenged. What the f?On the whole the script is a typical Hollywood B-movie concoction that holds little merit. If this would have been the first movie in the series I think there would never had been a series made at all.So why did I like it then? Well, even if the script is nothing to write home about it is not a total disaster and it serves as an excuse to provide 90 minutes of good entertaining Vampire vs Lycan action. Plain and simple.Of course Kate Beckinsale is a good reason for liking the movie as well. Her moving around in her intimidating (and good looking) skintight clothes slashing up Lycans in various creative ways makes up for some of the not so stellar script. I probably pi$$ed of a bunch of feminists there but it is not really like a care about that.The action and the CGI is reasonably well done and another reason to like the movie. Actually, come to think about it, Kate Beckinsale, the action and the CGI is pretty much the reasons I liked this movie.They could have selected a more charismatic bad guy though. For most of the movie I felt Marcus was bland and even a bit dull.It is not the best movie in the series but it does not exactly shame the series either. For me, I have to rate my enjoyment of it as above average compared to movies in general."
" Final chapter (?)
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,6,"You never know with franchises and even if they call it a final chapter, a reboot or even another sequel may come sometime in the future. Doesn't have to be the near future. And with a woman at helm, this goes to show you, that good action cinema does not have to be gender based. The director of this had some experience behind the camera which probably helped too.I am a bit biased of course with anything related to Kate Beckinsale. Can you blame me? Still I think it's fair to say that this is better than the last installment. But you can feel that this loses a bit of its touch and the stamina not only from the viewer is almost exhausted. But while it is predictable, it also has its fine moments and it does the job it is supposed to do. Entertain lightly ..."
" Great elements for another take on the Underworld, but...
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,6,"...very poorly directed. The editing was dreadful, which made the film feel extremely rushed. Parts 1 and 2 had their tiny easily-forgivable plot holes, which where barely noticeable and blended into the film with great action sequences and superb acting, unlike Blood Wars. This time, the flow of the film felt very choppy, and by the third act it clearly seems like they ran out of time/budget/steam. Still worth a look because of the basic elements of the Underworld story and the amazing Kate, but this one needed way more supervision."
" Entertaining but far too dark
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,7,"If you like the Underworld series you will like the film. It has Kate Beckinsale in her leading role again, and interesting premise which I shall not say to avoid spoilers. Some old idea's and tropes along with some new one's to put some fresh blood in to the mix (blood....get it) ;)However the entire film is far too dark. Underworld is set in the dark world of Vampires and Lycans and is almost entirely set at night but even then it is far too dark. It is as if all the lights are off and we are expected to watch the entire film by moonlight.....or specifically obviously day for night shots coloured to look super dark. If there is another film I sincerely hope that they add more light. None of the other films have been so dimly lit."
" Too Much Blood About Nothing
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,5,"If you have watched the previous four Underworld movies, then you should continue with this one (like myself). This movie takes place right after the previous one. Everybody is trying to find Selena's daughter because as a hybrid that she is, her blood is the key to stop the war.Yes, we already know this story from other movies and sadly in this one there are many plot holes that are filled with action sequences: lycans vs vampires, vampires vs vampires, ice skating It is a shame because the first Underworld movie it really was a breath of fresh air (it was 2003) and now, 13 years later cash is king and they are still presenting new movie after new movie, continuing a story that does need to be continued. They should have stopped right after the second movie. To be clear: this movie gives not much added value into the Underworld universe and it still leaves some old and new unanswered questions.Of course we like watching Kate Beckinsale kicking some faces and biting some asses but just kicking for kicking without a reason behind it might get us tired of it. The war between vampires and lycans is till the main theme of the movie and there is no way that we can remember why is started in the first place (to answer that we would have to rewatch all the movies). Best/worst of all? It looks like there is a sixth movie coming!A movie made for fans of the saga. And for those no fans, there is a quick summary of the previous movie at the beginning for you to be filled up and try to enjoy if not for the story but for the battle sequences."
" Horrible plot. Horrible sub-plots. Worst version ever.
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,3,"Whomever wrote this garbage ruined the franchise with this terrible take movie. What is the point of watching a vampire/werewolf movie if all they do is shoot at each other with machine guns? I may as well have watched Saving Private Ryan because at least the shooting would be more in line with the venue.This franchise had a ton of potential since the first ""low budget"" film, Underworld, which created an instant following. These losers today have no sense of genre, venue, or plot. This movie was even worse than the last Transformers movie with Mark Wahlberg.There are only a very select few writers, directors, producers who can put together a well thought out, well written, well cast, beautifully shot film. It is apparent that none of them were involved in this poor excuse for an Underworld movie."
" Everyone wants that sweet, sweet blood
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,5,"Selene is getting her @#$ beat more in this film that all the previous.Everyone wants that sweet, sweet blood.Treachery after treachery.At least there is a progressive movement.So precious the blood, yet you spill it all over? And why is vampire blood so watery? I guess it's the lack of white blood cells? Or the age? They should spread the council members out.Feels like the setup of another, hopefully, final chapter. I feel like it has run it's course."
" Can not see much of anything
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,4,"I was a fan of these movies, but you could not see anything the movie was so dark. I have to assume it was low budget and there were no details to expose, thus the low lighting to hide what was not there or what was poorly done. Why did they bother? As previously noted, why all the stated issues with penetrating the coven, when they just burst in?"
" Lots of vampires, guns and action...
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,7,"""Underworld: Blood Wars"" turned out to be a rather enjoyable installment in the ""Underworld"" franchise, and if you enjoyed any of the previous movies, then you will definitely also like ""Underworld: Blood Wars"".The story in ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" continues on with the raging war between the vampires and the lycans. Selene, the highly-trained vampire death dealer, seeks to end this war that still rages.There is a good amount of action in the movie. And this action is fast paced, well-choreographed and quite intense. Just as it has been in the previous movies, so it is nice that the movie continues on in the same pace.The storyline in ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" was a bit on the simplistic side, as it is not one with many layers, nor one that really innovates the franchise nor the genre as such. But despite its simplicity, it is still an enjoyable movie to watch, just don't expect a grand Shakespearian experience.""Underworld: Blood Wars"" has very good special effects and CGI, just as in the previous movies. Furthermore, there is still amazing detail and designs on the costumes and wardrobes, which is quite unique for the franchise. The sets also have a lot of great details. The make-up on the vampires is good and believable, but the special effects on the lycans (werewolves) is just amazing and it looks so realistic.This movie also has a good cast ensemble, and it is nice to see that Kate Beckinsale returns to her role. Furthermore, it was also nice to see some good appearances by Charles Dance, James Faulkner and others.""Underworld: Blood Wars"" is definitely a movie worthy to be an installment to the franchise, and it is most certainly a movie that will please fans of the franchise."
" Please consider...
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,8,"First off - this is the 5 movie in a story line which for the most parts has to ""reinvent"" it self every time. This will ofcause make it all a bit ""flimsy"" - HOWEVER - It REMAINS the best series in this genre. If you like this kind of fantasy/horror/action movie - then this movie is kinda great. IT DOES clearly shine through that this movie is made on a VERY limited budget... 35mil USD is peanuts these days, and many mainstream movies use more than that on their marketing!But... Let's talk about the bad: OK we are introduced to a new ""sub breed""/coven of the vampire race... And they can apparently ""warp"" or ""blink"" around. First off - if the vampires knew how to do this, then it is VERY unlikely this wouldn't be more common. It is basically a superpower... no wait it ACTUALLY is 100% a superpower! LOL! and they under-utilize it to an insane degree in this movie too in several larger battles without any explanation as to why... Both these battles are pretty desperate - so one would think they would use any trick they have to survive the onslaught... But no...The main vampire villain is..... so damn generic and predictable that it hurts. She could have been a much more dominant character and it's actually not the fault of the actress in my view... I think she did pretty well with what she was given - so to me this rest souly on the director and the script.The end fight is really uninspired. MAJOR SPOILER! Selena rips out the lycan leaders spine like it was nothing after just having being pommeled all to hell without resisting... Apparently he never posed any threat to her after her transformation...???The good: Most of the action and effects are actually pretty close to what the big budget movies brings us - with a few exceptions. Many people talked about the ""hero landings"" of Selena in the first movie, however this one has a scene which comes fairly close to that (The one where David jumps out of the pool and splits a Lycan in half) It actually made me say ""daaaammmnnnn!"" out loud. A fairly impressive feat for a low budget movie...The keep much of the ""tacky"" feel of the former movies - which is a good thing! It would feel fake if the movie all of the sudden changed tone compared to the 4 other movies - and it succeeds very well in feeling like ""another episode"" in the franchise! It IS however CLEAR that this is meant as a ""precursor to the final chapter"" movie, so there are A LOT of unfinished story lines here... So I truly hope we get the 6th movie!I think much of the rating it has gotten in reviews is due to people not understanding that this is part of a continued story and that this movie IS made with a budget of close to what Jennifer Lawrence got paid for making passengers... If the full budget is 35 mil USD, the actual production budget is most likely close to that 20 mil mark.... which is kind of insane these days! If people want this kind of movie to exist, the CAN NOT fairly judge them as they do an Avengers movie! It is just not fair! I mean Cmon - Even Deadpool which people said had a laughably low budget had 58 mil USD... 23 mil USD more ... which as I said is probably the whole damn production budget of Blood Wars!This movie is AWESOME for what it is! It nicely bridges the 4th movie and what - if it ever gets made - will most likely be the finale. 17% at 3.8/10 on rotten tomato and those sorts of ratings are dumb as dirt. I shows how many people have been so heavily spoiled by 250mil USD budget marvel movie juggernauts that they have lost their objectivity!Is it a masterpiece? No... ofcause not! It's a horror/fantasy/action movie... DUH! LOL"
" Not as good as the previous one but still one that I enjoyed and one I recommend if you are a fan of this series.
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,7,"""There is no beginning. There is no ending. There is only becoming."" Selene (Beckinsale), after losing her child, is bent on finally ending the Vampire/Lycan war once and for all. When she is double crossed it is up to her and David (James) to lead the fight and bring peace to the world once and for all. This is a series that is a little like the Rocky series in a way. By that I mean the first two movies were really focused on telling a story and character development. The later sequels were action focused and going for straight entertainment and fun rather than story based. This is not necessarily a bad thing and there is enough story to keep the movie going but this is another sequel that puts the action front and center. The movie is entertaining and a very worthy, and possibly final, addition to the series. Overall, this is not as good as the previous one but still one that I enjoyed and one I recommend if you are a fan of this series. I give this a solid B."
" Just take it as entertainment
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"It's Kate Beckinsale again in tight leather! Come on people, pop in the Blu-Ray or stream it and load up the popcorn. Take off the critic's thinking cap for a night. Don't expect too much with a sophisticated plot or story line. Do expect some Lycan ass-kicking from Selene as usual, and enjoy the movie for what it is - a war between vampires and werewolves. The CGI could have been better, but did I not mention Selene/Kate in tight leather?"
" Cry Wolf
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,7,"The Underworld movies are not classics, but if you enjoy hammy acting, vampires, werewolves and Kate Beckinsale in skin tight leather kicking ass then they can be a lot of fun.Blood Wars is an end game of sorts, although it still leaves room for more films if the money men think it worthwhile. It would be a decent ending if they decide to close the chapter on this franchise now.The plot is quite straightforward, there's some decent action and fight scenes and a few new characters and creatures introduced, and it doesn't drag on too long and outstay its welcome. Charles Dance lends some gravitas to the cast, and Lara Pulver has a lot of fun as the power crazed Semira, while Kate Beckinsale is as youthful and badass as ever.If you enjoy the Underworld series then I'm sure you'll find this a decent addition."
" A short review of ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" (2016)
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,5,"I'm not sure what to say about ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" (2016). It really differs little from the previous ""Underworld"" movies. If you've seen those, you've kinda seen this one.The vampires look like underwear models, or maybe a goths-only high school drama club. The werewolves look  not homeless, exactly, but like burly, long-haired, unemployed grunge rockers. Both groups speak portentously and repeatedly about things like ""LINEAGE"" and ""BLOOD LINES"" and ""THE WAR"" and ""AMELIA."" (Who was Amelia again?) There are the requisite betrayals and forbidden inter-species romances. The entire thing felt like a feature-length music video.Maybe I'm being too harsh. I would actually give this film a 5 out of 10 for at least bringing some good things to the table. Kate Beckinsale is a good actress, and she brings the same magnetism that she always does to Selene, the franchise's protagonist. Charles Dance is always superb, and is always fun to watch. (There are at least two ""Game of Thrones"" alumni here — one is Dance as a vampire elder, and the other is Tobias Menzies as the leader of the ""Lycans."") The nicest surprise, though, was seeing Lara Pulver as an ambitious vampire alpha female — fans of ""Sherlock"" (2010 – 2017) will recognize her as that series' incarnation of Irene Adler. She's a great actress, and she seems to relish this kind of role.All in all, though, I can't say I actually recommend this."
" For a fifth one it's not that bad
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,6,"Let's be clear from the beginning, it's not the best one from the Underworld saga but it's certainly still watchable. Underworld: Blood Wars is the fifth movie of this saga and like it always is with movies that continue forever they hardly never get better. No exception with this saga, the first one was the best one but all the others are still enjoyable to watch. Like Kate Beckinsale, she's also enjoyable to watch. If it was up to me I would prefer more biting instead of vampires with guns but that's what makes this saga different from the other vampire movies. The Lycans could also be more present in their wolves forms than in their human form, just to make everything a bit more spicier. But the story isn't bad. It's what I expected to be for the fifth movie. Could it have been better? Sure it could, but if you're a fan of this saga you won't regret watching this one as well."
" The Vidiot Reviews...
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,4,"Underworld: Blood WarsThe key to winning the war against vampires is cutting off their crushed velvet supplies.Lamentably, the bloodsuckers in this action movie also have skintight leather to wear.Sought by her lycanthropic enemy (Tobias Menzies) who needs her hybrid daughter so he can create vampire/werewolf soldiers from her blood, Death Dealer Selene (Kate Beckinsale) seeks asylum with an upstart coven where she trains others like her.Selene's stay is short-lived due to her host's (Lara Pulver) desire to drink her blood, so she and her student (Theo James) strike out to find her offspring before anyone else does.The fifth installment in this less than memorable monster franchise, Blood Wars attempts to reinvigorate the struggling series with millennial material and mindless gunfights. Both of which do nothing to distract from the muddled script and ho-hum SPFX. Lastly, werewolves leave more than explosive landmines on the battlefield. Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca"
" A Worthy Continuation
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,8,"This installment in the series wisely ignores the previous movie except for including Thomas, David, and Selene's daughter (though the daughter does not appear she is a topic.) They return to the same type of movie as the first two: dark and gritty vampire versus werewolf and leave out any mention of humanity at large being aware of either species or trying to purge them. Thankfully they realized this was a horrible path to have gone down at all. The one flaw is the actor they chose for the main villain werewolf. Tobias Menzies has most recently played the simpering Edmure Tully and before that he played the simpering Brutus on Rome. He has neither the physical nor psychological presence to hold the role he was caste in. Thankfully Lara Pulver (Irene Addler from BBC's Sherlock) is there is bring much needed gravitas as a secondary antagonist."
" Not great, but good none the less
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,7,"Liked to see the movie, with an exciting story. It was a little predictable, but I enjoyed it. I liked all the underworld movies and i'm looking forward to the next one.

" I liked this film, and yes, I am fan of the saga
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,8,"I can say this one, is one of the best movies of the saga Underworld, is a good action movie, with a good story. If you have seen all the previous movies of underworld you will love this one, because is like a fresh restart, but without deleting all the past like happened in Terminator Genesys (I hated) and is well written.This time vampires and werewolves are amazingly organize, and the story continues in a good way. You can go to see this one without any fear, you wont regret it."
" Boring with hilariously bad action
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,2,"After the very bad Underworld: Awakening I was curious if the 5th movie in the franchise was going to be any better. I was surprised that it could be even worse.. The movie opens with the exact same boring recap of the previous movies only now it also includes the 4th one as well. The story picks up right after the last movie ended. Vampire death dealer Selene (Kate Beckinsale) has lost her daughter and only has two people to trust in the world: the vampires David (Theo James) and his father Thomas (Charles Dance). The lycans and other vampires are after the blood of Selene's daughter, because she is the first pure blood hybrid. Selene get's lured into the main vampire coven to help prepare for the battle against the lycans but who can she trust in there? We all know that these movies only have one job to do: look cool and have awesome action scenes. But the first hour(!) does not contain any action at all! It's just one boring plot exposing scene after another, where the cardboard cutout characters are telling us what we need to know just over and over until even the most die-hard fan is dozing of. And when the action finally start, it looks so ridiculous that I was almost falling of the couch from laughter. There is a scene with two people standing 3 feet apart, shooting at each other without cover..? And after their guns are empty they start screaming at each other because why not? :P It's also confusing that some vampires are invincible but others can be killed by twisting their neck? Euhm WTF? And why do the vampire wait patiently before the lycans are transformed before attacking? Is that some kind of moral code? And the lycans bring some awesome looking big gun but all it does is punch some holes in the walls to let sunlight in. Wow. So after all this time the big brains of the lycans come with the idea of punching holes in walls? Ow and what about the ice castle battle? ""we are safe from the lycans here, it's to cold"". 20 seconds later there is a lycan attack: because they wear COATS! Wow they are evolving fast! :PUnderworld: Awakening was bad but at least it had some action in it. I don't know what this is supposed to be but your better of watching the first one again. The only thing that is keeping it from a '1' is that it gave me a good laugh."
" Such a shame these franchises get so bad
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,4,"I liked the original Underworld, a lot, and not just because Beckinsale was running around in tight leather. I liked Evolution almost as much. Rise of the Lycans was a pleasant surprise, but then came Awakening i knew the series was doomed.I just didn't think it would get this bad so quickly.I cant decide whats worse, the story, the script or the editing.Don't bother, even if its free."
" Watch and enjoy don't pick it apart
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,7,"I love the Underworld series and this definitely isn't the worst like all the others are stating,it could've been a lot better I admit but it kept me interested to the end. I would've loved to have seen Tobias Menzies story in more depth and removal of Lara Pulver but we can't all be pleased. The worst movie was Awakening and was one that I never watched again, Blood Wars will be one I'll add to the library along with the first 3 and I look forward to the possibilities left open by the end."

Take The Fast and the Furious for example, yeah, they are very explosive, they lie right through your face, but they are always looking the next best thing in each movie. AND lets be reasonable, you can't expect an Oscar worthy film when you are going to see the 5th or 7th film, you know they are packed with extreme bad word of dog's excrement, but WE LIKE IT. Know lets circle back to Underworld, the first two films were amazing, the 3rd not to much, but the 4th and 5th are the same dog's... you get the idea... Of course it's worth watching it because of Kate Beckinsale (MY GOOOOD), and that's worth a 4 point review and the other point it's for the entire movie, and i was really hoping for an amazing film, but left with a dog's... taste in my mouth (not you Selene of course GOOOOOOD), after that i felt like if i was sick, but not physically sick, Franchise Phobia Sick, PLEASE STOP MAKING SEQUELS THAT SUCK, YOU ARE RUINING MY CHILDHOOD.

",2017-03-21 00:00:00,1,"The story line sucks. There is no character depth in lycans. They should have kept Lucian alive. The war would have been much more interesting. This movie is boring with no good lycan. Every movie we get a ugly loser as a lycan and he never stays alive for the next movie. Now the writers have given the vampires an upgrade. Vampires now can walk in daylight and not burn while the lycans remain weak. And the movie is so unrealistic. Marius could have ripped Selene apart but he didn't he just kept punching her and Selene ripped his spine out, so unrealistic. Marius could have bit her head off, he was huge but he didn't. This movie is so unrealistic and it sucks. Why are there no female lycans in this movie? There were many female vampire but not one female lycans. Why? Lycans don't turn women? hahhahahaha This movie is stupid."
" Too fast
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,5,"Have seen all Underworld movies. Nothing new. But there is something different about this movie. It was so fast, that after watching movie i could say that there was so much action, talking, different places changing and running in such a small amount of time. Everything happened so fast. Too fast.I was expecting more from this movie, as saw some reviews with quite high rankings. Movie is just for one evening if you are a fan of Underworld. If you haven't seen any other part of it, don't bother watching it. No high notes, no low notes, maybe a few good action scenes, but that's it."
" Just end it!!
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,3,"I've been a huge fan of the series and I must say this film was just horrible. It had no connection to the original movies whatsoever. This is just another unnecessary sequel with some nice action sequences and awful plot. After being disappointed by Awakening, I had some hope in this one but alas!How and when did the Lycans get so powerful and when did all the Vampires start dying out? No explanation for that. Huge loophole. SPOILER ALERT: They never mentioned anything about Micheal and then eventually in the end it is shown that Micheal was killed. At least show us what happened and how it happened. I just wanna ask the makers: If you guys want us to enjoy these movies then at least come up with a sensible plot or at least tie up the loose ends. I would have loved to see what happened to Micheal after him and Selene were captured in Underworld: Awakening. I was expecting it in this movie and then all of a sudden he is shown to be dead without any explanation whatsoever.Overall this film is in no way connected to the first 2 movies (which were wonderful). This film has a lot of loopholes and it serves as a huge disappointment especially for Underworld fans like myself. I think they should just end this series if they won't come up with a good story. I'm highly disappointed."
" poor
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,3,"movie was watchable, but the problem with so main pointless twists in a movie is that there not enough time spent on character development. so yes i watched the movie and after it i have no idea where the bad guy came from, why he did what he did. all we know is he killed her boyfriend.i found that the vampire women who drunk her blood and died 5mins later was a pointless time waste that could been used in the actual story.that guy she once saved who was weak. turns out he has the blood of the elders and just knowing that auto makes him have a lot of strenth it seems yer i think left big plot hole there.then it was also abit weird how easy she was beaten, as if the story writers had forgotten how strong she was after the elder blood was given to her. all because the plot demanded it. if you watch the other movies and see how fast at combat she is. then there was no way she would not seen him pull that knife out."
" Surprising quality despite HALF the budget!
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,9,"I'm actually quite shocked at what the studio managed to accomplish here.We have highly regarded actors making their best of a script that is too short, a budget that is too small. Yet they still manage to fit it all into a well knit movie that is entertaining, dark, gritty and as exciting as it can be in the short time that the movie lasts. I honestly cannot see any way that they could have done it better and it's a shame they didn't have more time to polish this into something great. It has a ton of potential and the world of under have had it for a long time.Considering that this have gotten half the budget from the previous movies, i would figure that this is the last of the series..."
" harks back to the first underworld!
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,10,"If you've seen the previous movies, it starts out like they all did with a quick recap, which is fine if you haven't watched the others in a while. I found this one to have a better story line then all but the first one. Some great additions to the well known history of this franchise with David being Amelia's son and the addition of the other universe. This war is evolving which is the only way to make it interesting as it keeps going. The only downfall as most people have pointed out is the way they explained away the absence of Michael. I like most would of loved to see him back but also knowing that probably wasn't going to happen. Recasting that role would also have been a serious drawback as all I have to reference is the mummy franchise to see the damage that could do.For all the negative things I had read about this, it blew away my expectations. For people who love franchises ( which I do), this one definitely brings this one back to the forefront and makes me excited for the next one!"
" underworld blood war
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,7,"I had to watch this one twice as first viewing I thought The movie was not cool at all.my 2nd viewing always like to see films twice see if I missed anything,what I missed was this is a v good additional movie to the franchise,Kate Beckinsale was her awesome best being the death dealer she is.don't expect much Change but there are a few surprises she gets to have a few different powers and the great coven of vampires got some good characters in it with a few twists all in all if you like these films there is not much to complain about so sit back and enjoy underworld blood wars,if like me you cant get enough of Selene dealing death to Lycans."
" Didn't Quite Hit the Mark
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,6,"What can I say, Len Wiseman's 1st two movies in the series was the best. Since then, the franchise has been declining. Production value for this new installment is lackluster, direction is missing its cue on some parts, story is below average, and some of the acting are horrendous. (Theo James being one) but I guess if you look that good, who needs acting skills right?? But it was much better than Underworld Awakening, which is arguably the worst installment of this franchise. Kate Beckinsale's back doing her thing, kicking butt! and taking names. Action sequences at times missed it's mark. Very confusingly shot, not much excitement, the build up in the second act gave us nothing climatic in the 3rd act, the only highlight was probably Lara Pulvar's character as Semira. She gave a convincing performance but she didn't have much to work with, with such a fluffy script. This would be the second worst installment to this franchise. If they decide to make another one, I hope they bring in someone who can revamp this series. There are not many vampire/werewolf movies out there. I don't want this one to go down in flames!"
" It fit nicely with the rest of the series
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,8,Much like the Resident Evil series this franchise suffered the same fate with the curse:If you make enough money at the box office you will have to make a sequels until the end so this year we had Underworld: Blood Wars the next chapter from a franchise nobody bother ask but we still get it every few years but is it as bad as people think?Myself always think if a movie good it good but if it bad tried to view it as a dumb fun time and this movie did that really well.Beside the horrible script full of plot holes with uninteresting characters and movie sub- plots being throw every where when the director think it make sense.The key to fully enjoy this movie is you need to shut down your brain and started to smile every time you see a character get shot or being decapitated by Kate Beckinsale wearing a spandex suit while looking at the god-awful CGI werewolf and blood effects i guarantee you will have a good time with this movie.P/S(I gave this movie the same grade as Resident Evil: The Final Chapter for the same reason)
" One of the better sequels in the series
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,6,Maybe not the best sequel but not the worst. Decent story with plenty of action. CGI could be annoying and distracting at times as it went from realistic to cartoonish. Bekingsale is always a pleasure to watch. Whether in a serious role or kicking butt. Definitely watch this to continue the series. There will be more I'm sure.
" It was good! It exceeded my expectations based on reviews.
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,6,"I've been a fan of the Underworld series since the 1st film, which remains the best one in the series. I was excited to hear the news that ""Blood Wars"" was coming but I was hesitant seeing that I already have a love hate relationship with the previous films in the series. When reviews started pouring in for ""Blood Wars"" I lost all interest in going to see it in theaters. I have to say that now that I've seen the film for myself it is nowhere near as bad as many reviews made it out to be, in fact it's one of the better ones in the series. I guess the biggest issue I have with ""Blood Wars"" is that the film spent too much time on a story that has already been told. The entire story the film told could've been wrapped up in 45 min and then the story of Selene & her daughter could've been wrapped up. I would've also enjoyed if the second half of the film allowed us to see how Selene would handle the role of being an elder."
" yeah
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,1,"I almost sleep't at this movie with my wife, we saw all the movies and since the first movie in 2003 WHO HAS more effects and more action now we was very desapointed in this one (when you think we are in 2017 expecting a bit more action). Well im glad i didn't go watching it in cinema 3D, waste of time and money. in one WORD: BORING."
" I never get tired of Selene.
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,10,"I gave this movie a 10 because I saw Fifty Shades Darker yesterday and this movie today and I want to make a statement through this. Comparison aside, Blood Wars has it's faults. They obviously were left without money somewhere by the middle of the shooting. I could swear to that, because the difference between the quality of some scenes and the fast-forwarded-crudely-cut other scenes is striking. A school kid could tell the difference. What happened to the premiere or playing in movies? It's DVD out already? Weird.It also bothers me that vampires can have children...but hey, if Selene can have one then so can....SPOILER ALERT.... . . . Amalia. It is odd that it's with another vampire. At least Selene's baby was with a warm-aging-lycan-hybrid. Anyway.The plot kinda holds up and there is more sexy-depraved stuff in this one, as well as some explicit killings.But Kate Beckinsale is still the most gorgeous and also believable vampire that ever walked in the fantasy world. Her latex suit and cape and boots are still there. And that's all that matters. Oh and she kicks ass as well."
" Quite a let-down
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,4,"Being a fan of the Underworld films, I was expecting a proper squeal to ""Underworld: Awakening"", however what we got was something that felt more like a spin-off than a squeal. There were several ""WTF"" moments, combined with the inconsistencies dragged the film down further. The only joy I found while watching the film was seeing a new instalment in Underworld series."
" Worst Underworld movie
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,3,"These movies were never made for Oscar consideration, I understand that, but the first three at least tried something. Creating some kind of mythology, war between vampires and lycans. Solid concept for the fans of these types of films that offer a bit of story and focus more on action and gore. First Underworld, released back in 2003, is pretty solid action-horror film. Sequel, Underworld: Evolution expanded the origin story for these species, while Underworld: Rise of the Lycans served as prequel, giving us idea how and why the whole grudge between vampires and lycans started. Then came 4th film, Awakening, solid concept but lame execution. Very forgettable film, even for Underworld fans. And now we have Blood Wars, 5th and worst in the franchise. Nothing in this movie works. Action, the strongest point in these types of films, was so poorly edited and is completely boring. Overall, movie is so badly directed and edited, filled with lame dialogue and shameful acting. Even the effects were not that great, with so many cringe worthy moments. Such a disaster."
" The worst movie in the series by a long, long way
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,2,"Despite several of the actors from Game of Thrones making an appearance, this movie is a massive disappointment.Compared to the earlier movies, this seems to have been made on a budget. If you are an Underworld fan you must watch it, but if you'd never seen an Underworld movie before you would be turned off the whole franchise by this rubbish.Poorly scripted, poorly acted and the worst effects and cinematography of the entire series to date.MASSIVE DISAPPOINTMENT. 23/100 average metacritic score is about right.No wonder it only aired in cinemas for a couple of weeks."
" They could have done more...
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,4,"This one was seriously underwhelming...the trailer over-promised and the movie under-delivered. I expected more from the story and it was lacking that ""umph""factor. I thought that final showdown between Marius and Selene should have had much more action...and for a Vampire sanctuary that was supposedly impregnable, the Lycans waltzed in like it was nothing! such gaps are inexcusable from a franchise that had us glued to our seats with the first 3 films. The guy playing Marius was an excellent pick but i think the script writers should have done more for his character. What i disliked the most was how Michael was just killed off in a flashback...(really??)and that Selene the greatest of the death-dealers looked bleak half the time in this movie (Kate should not agree to another movie unless the writers up their game) just did not do it justice. The fight scenes were not as ""authentic"" as the first three (too much gun use!!)I mean, these are two immortal species with serious powers and strength...why have them use guns like all the time?? The lore of the first three movies is so watered down: the rich history of the two races, the quest for dominance, the ""ancient-ness"" of the bloodlines...i just wish they did more with this...and it appears we may have a 6th one."
" Weak performances, horrid action sequences, poor editing...
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,5,"One thing this film does not have is inconsistent pacing, they are quite true to brain numbing speed. Blink and you miss the film. It is really clear that the editing was done to cut the film down. It is discontinuity editing in its most horrible form. Even to the untrained film eye of mine I could see the several in sequences have nothing in common and does nothing to string some sort of meaning together. There must be some explanation for cutting this movie down to an hour 30, maybe they didn't want movie goers to suffer more of this, now, poor excuse of a franchise. If that is the case I thank you.I once liked this franchise and had hoped for some sort of redemption after the more contained last entry which seemed to kick start my interest a bit. They have the lore and the actors. But, they give them stupid cringe inducing lines, making even the ever classy Kate Beckinsdale flat. The rest of the performances weren't any better but Theo James seemed to have tried his best, yes he was actually decent. Tobias Menzies' character was forgettable and clearly needed more of a back story and more screen time. These films usually have strong Lycan villains who you feel sympathy for, it seemed like they tried that for a half of the film and then completely went the other way. Charles Dance plays the same character over and over again but strongly as always. The Semira character was a very unnecessary one, in an already short film with too much stuff going on. Overstuffed 90 minutes that needs more time for new character development and should have been more contained."
" Pretty / Boring.
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,4,"Film is pretty and filmed good, but my god - one of the most boring films I've had to sit through with family. Would definitely not want to watch again sorry. Too confusing and pointless. I'm a big fan of lots of films and very disappointed by this. One of the main fighting scenes was frankly appalling and not to usual standard. Four stars again simply for just the good effects and filming."
" Not even a shadow of the series that once was.
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,3,"I remember the first one. One of the best movies i ever saw. Great Action. Great Performances. Tight storytelling. Then the second, which was not as great but still good, and packed a punch. Then came the third which reinforced the series as a whole and was a good movie. After that came the fourth which was a let down. Cheezy story, fake action nothing really going for it. Except the 3-D, which was great.Now came this stinking piece of crap, a huge let down. No story, no good action whatsoever. Kate is barely convincing and underutilized. A villain that is completely unconvincing. Supporting cast is just bad. Story is meandering and convenient for the plot. A bad TV Show is better than this. I feel sorry for the fan who showed up at the cinema hall. ITS A BAD MOVIE..!"
" Awful
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,1,"It's impressive how poorly written and directed this movie is; it unfortunately lacks from any sort of good taste, and beside the characters there's nothing that resembles an underworld movie, hands down the worst of the franchise yet.It is obvious that the story has no backbone, the direction is at the level of an amateur project, as if the director has no clue what it's doing, making obvious the lack of sensibility to the narrative of the previous installments."
" Better than the last one...
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,6,"Well... there isn't much to be said of this movie. Perhaps the ideal thing that this movie does is that it erases the dreadful movie that came before it and gives the Underworld franchise an opportunity to expand into new elements. Its about as cheesy as the other movies and the special effects were lacking in some places. The writing was excellent but the dialogue was pretty unimaginative. I would compare it to finding a diamond in a lump of coal. Like many movies, it had quite a few ups and downs. I think that fans of the original 2 movies will be again disappointed but I think that younger folks looking to explore the franchise could find this one to be the most intriguing. Overall this movie gets a 6 out of 10 stars."
" simple story but a perfect flick
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,7,"13 years between the first one and this entry in the Underworld franchise. I was a bit afraid that it wouldn't add a thing towards the story but it does.If you haven't seen any other Underworld flick, don't worry. You will be informed in one minute just before the flick starts. And it's funny that 4 flicks can be summarized in one minute. Nevertheless, throughout the flick Selene (Kate Beckinsale) will have enough flashbacks to tell you more about the vampires and the lycans.The good thing is that they made a flick clocking in under 90 minutes. And it works, the flick is over before you know it. Because it's full of action and a 'simple' story you can pick it up easy and watch it without thinking about previous entries.Of course you need effects and they are looking like previous entries, I mean, the lycans do transform in the same way as always. But it's full of effects and all looking stunning again.And it's not that the franchise is over, hopefully we haven't got to wait another 3 years. Not as bad as many said or have written. Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5"
" Another leg in a very long journey, Frodo's journey for vampires and lycans.
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,5,"When Underworld first came out, it was exciting, innovative and held enough of an interesting story to make me want to see another chapter...the 5th chapter is just that, another chapter. It was OK, neither terrible nor amazing. It seems we have now demoted two of folklore's most enduring monsters to a ""beverley hill 90210"" type of generation. Yes there is blood and occasional gore but nothing really gripping anymore. One of the more interesting chapters was Underworld 3 which explored the origins of the Corvinus clan and the birth of both Vampire and Lycan. This chapter doesn't add nor detract from its self contained pantheon and if another one does come along no doubt I'll watch it. But don't expect anything too special. There is a yoda character to Selene's ""Amidala"" character, there is the ""sith lord"" and the usual suspects of traitors and ""surprising"" twists. BUT it's about as scary as ""Take Hart"", don't watch it with the lights off....why bother, to unless you have a migraine? As for the Lycan Marius....can't get over thinking of him as the pathetic Game of throne's pathetic Stark Banner-man Lord blah-blah- blah."
" Always good to see Selene back in action
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,9,"It's been such a long time since last Underworld franchise. It's a bit disappointed to know some characters' death but all in all, it's always good to see Selene back in action. Would be great to see more of her child as well too. Will the change of director change anything? Maybe but not much to me perhaps. Movies focusing on how hard women worked, fought in search of victory and success is still as rare as it comes. And frankly, such characters, more often than not are being under-estimated. Definitely need more movies depicting the sacrifices of what people have done to maintain humanity in the world, even though we all know this has become more and more challenging."
" The Best Underworld So Far
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,10,"As a frame of reference, I agree that the best 2 movies of all times are ""Shawshank Redemption"" and ""Godfather"". But we're not talking Academy Awards for any Underworld movies or any movies in this Vampires/Lycans genre. I have seen every Underworld movie. I love them all. So with that clearly out of the way, here is my opinion about UW Blood Wars.I think UW Blood Wars is the best UW movie to date. Why? I just feel it is. It is entertaining. It has great acting, action, picture quality, and soundtrack. I thought the plot was very good (as good as any Vampire/ Lycan can be and better than most in this genre).I don't see why some people are so critical about this movie. All movies in this genre have plot holes and other imperfections. It's not meant to be a ""Shawshank"" or ""Godfather"". I would watch (repeated) UW Blood Wars over any other Vampire/ Lycan or SyFy movie ever made.The key is that I found this movie to be extremely ENTERTAINING. And I thought this was the best UW movie to date."
" Waste of time
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,1,"Bad even for the genre! It's boringly paced. Week plot. Compared to the first movies of the series, it's insubstantial! Nothing in this movie gets to be deepened, and yet every superficial aspect is stretched to the limit of boringness!I was excited by the fact the movie was directed by a woman, but what a disappointment!Some crappy CGI in the midst. Something I never expected (given the other films in the franchise). The first comes in a scene right at the beginning of the movie, where a werewolf gets run over by a car.There's an honest attempt by Kate Beckinsale to give it some layers. I watched it with some friends (Sunday afternoon) and I can tell for sure, everyone of us fell asleep at some point during the film."
" expected so much and get almost nothing
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,6,"First of all I'm a big fan of Underworld, I watched several times the all parts of Underworld so this review is pretty realistic you will get. So, when I first watched the trailer I thought vau, this is going to be great, I was so excited and then last night when I watched the movie, I was really disappointed. Here is why, first three parts was so great there was so much action and good old fight with power and strength between lycans and vampires and not just that, but story in the whole film was great, than the fourth part came, and it was also great movie but I just didn't like the story so much, I mean she was pregnant without even knowing it and having a birth while sleeping, and than the Michaels death in such a stupid way, oh come on. Than this blood wars, it started great, but later. What I miss most is this good old fight, with bear hands, there is so much fight with this stupid guns, there is only two fight scenes worth mention. OK we all know that vampires used guns, but not in such an amount. I was glad what there was love again between lycan and vampire, but it was so obviously that Marius was just using her to get what he wants, so it wasn't really a love. So far there was only two love between lycan and vampire and it was great, true love. So this one, third love, was fake so actually I didn't like it. Love between lycan and vampire has to be true and glories like it was before. And than in the end you find out how Michael died, he was supposed to be the stronger off them all. But no, here he died like he was nothing. So too sum up. Bad fights, fake love, and bad story. Totally ruined the underworld."
" Misses the mark
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,1,"It's everything you love about an Underworld movie, but it misses the mark every- time. The story is abysmal, the writing is infantile, the editing is bad, the characters lack substance and motivation. Selene one of the most powerful immortals in the story ever, is weak unnecessarily. The characters are so cookie cutter that its painful, its like someone grabbed an archetype out of every other Underworld franchise, so they could skimp on back story for all of the new characters. The tie ins are terrible, the fight scenes are cut short. Simply its like someone making a bad choice, rolling with it, make another bad choice, roll with it, make another bad choice, keep rolling with it, and on and on and on. Wish I could get those two ours back."
" Epic!
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,10,"This movie is absolutely, without a doubt amazing for the lack of a better word. From the first time I was introduced to the Underworld franchise,they have never failed to amaze me. To take a quote from another movie"" This is a rare movie franchise that succeeds on almost every level, where each character, scene, costume, are firing on all 4 cylinders to make a film worth repeated viewings"" Trust me,I will be re-watching all of them.Now I realize that everyone expects it to be as extraordinary as the first movie. I accept it for what it is. There will be some drawbacks,in regards to originality,but ultimately I am happy that they have decided with the continuation of this franchise."
" Like watching a vampire version of the A-team
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,1,"The story feels very rushed,liked they've just hastefully put a script together within a certain time frame, while Kate was still available for shooting.Seem like everyone is betraying someone else within the vampire clan, in a struggle for power Strangely enough the lycans/werewolf don't seem to have no such structure problems in their camp.Another thing that really bugs me with this movie, is all the dramatic pauses. The vampires are suppose to be smart an quick on their feet, but when ever something unforeseen(for them,cause everyone in the audience will have seen it coming a mile away, all ready) They stop and freeze and have these super dramatic pauses ,as if they were acting for Oscars. Generally they just make you want kick and scream at the TVKate B and Theo James, both have this just going through the motions acting over them.And radiate very little on screen chemistry.They are suppose to be super smart but can't seem to foresee even the simplest of action from their opponents.They also introduce to many characters, that you don't really get to know properly. They are just extras with a speaking part. You don't really get a feel for them what are their motives,why are they doing what they do etc.The action was kind of bad to, either they fight in the shadow/dark, or the camera is so close that all you see are feet and arms everywhere. They should have terminated the franchise after 3"
" Worst Underworld Yet
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,3,"Underworld: Blood Wars is the fifth movie in the series about the war between Vampires and Lycans. It is a series that should have been left alone after the second one, but here we are. Once again starring Kate Beckinsale, this movie follows her continuing fights against both groups. Selene is being chased by Vampires of the Eastern Coven, who claim to offer a pardon for Selene's killing of vampires from her own coven in previous films. She is being asked to train a new group of death dealers, the ones who fight lycans. Meanwhile, the lycans are after Selene to try to get information on the whereabouts of her daughter, a pure hybrid of both species, whose blood could end the war by giving them a large tactical advantage.This movie is dumb, convoluted, and just altogether bad. The story structure seems to have no set purpose, jumping from scene to scene with so much exposition dump, it's kind of hard to believe even the actors could keep up with the story. There are way too many characters introduced in this film, and no time is given to flesh them out. It seems that every character in this film is betraying another like a chain of betrayal, and it's very hard to keep up with who is good and bad when that keeps changing on you. Also, Underworld, bad as the movies are, is built on action. There are very few action scenes in this film, to make way for more talking and exposition. And the ones that do exist are so poorly edited that it's hard to decipher what is actually happening in them. There are also action scenes that are very funny because of the amount of screaming. If you've ever seen a small child pretend to be a monster by roaring in your face, then you have seen this movie's attempt at 2 people fighting in certain scenes. I laughed many times over many things in this film, but none as hard as that.Acting-wise, it seemed we had 2 kinds of actors. There were those who were only there for the paycheck such as Kate Beckinsale or Theo James, and those who went way over the top such as Daisy Head. The former group of actors said their lines, did their scenes, and went home, with no real care for what happened. Seems to me, especially with Beckinsale, that these actors are kind of stuck doing these films while we all know they are such great actors elsewhere. The others seemed to have seen the past films and thought that in order to ""top"" the ridiculousness of them, they had to overact everything.Another problem was the special effects. Sure, the original films had bad cgi, but there were great practical mixed in to make it look decent. This movie is all cgi, and poorly done cgi at that. Every lycan looks fake, like the budget for animation was $100. Blood squibs are often animated poorly as well, giving off a terribly fake effect. There is also a moment where one character is drinking blood, but anyone can tell it's just wine/ red water due to how thick it isn't.This film also cast wrong. Every character in this movie is white. Every new character, every extra, lycan and vampire alike, it's a pale-faced party. No diversity is terrible. Vampires may be pale, but black vampires do exist. As do black werewolves. It bothered me to not have any diversity at all. Though I guess maybe all the minorities were smart enough to stay away, as this movie was complete and utter garbage. Don't see this one. It's okay to skip. 30/100"
" Betrayals and Battles
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"The outcast Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is hunted down by the Lycans led by the powerful Marius (Tobias Menzies) that wants her daughter Eve and by the vampires seeking revenge for the death of Viktor and Marcus. Out of the blue, she is attacked by Lycans but David (Theo James) helps her but is wounded. Meanwhile, the ambitious vampire Semira (Lara Pulver) convinces David's father Thomas (Charles Dance) to plead to Cassius (James Faulkner) and the council of their coven to forgive the skilled Selene to train the new Death Dealers. He succeeds, but Selene and David are betrayed by Semira and her lover Vargas (Bradley James) and David witnesses Semira killing his father. They have to flee to seek shelter at the Nordic Coven Vador where David learns the truth about his mother. When the sanctuary is invaded by Marius and the Lycans, Selene fights Marius that wants to know Eve's whereabouts. Who will win the fight?""Underworld: Blood Wars"" is the fifth chapter of the Underworld franchise, with a story full of action, betrayals and battles. The viewer must be aware of details from the previous films (the best thing to do is to see them all again) since the plot is developed in fast pace and there is a ellipsis in the beginning of the story. Fans will certainly love this film and look forward to see the next story. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Anjos da Noite: Guerras de Sangue"" (""Angels of the Night: Blood Wars"")"
" More mythos, more promise, no delivery
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,6,"This lazy movie does only harm to the Underworld franchise, introducing mysticism, quick ways of killing both lycans and vampires, adding more inbred dynastic bullshit, rigid dress codes and antiquated weaponry. At the same time it completely ignores Selene's daughter, goes through badly choreographed fights that have no sense and pretty much keeps the movie in the 90's.To add insult to injury, it takes two beautiful actresses like Kate Beckinsale and Lara Pulver and makes them completely unsexy. I mean, do these people even know why we liked Underworld in the first place? Hint: it wasn't extra teeth!Bottom line: entertaining as a B movie, however strongly connected to the other movies in the series, without which one understands nothing of the supposed motivations of the characters, but released late enough that no one actually remembers any details from them. A failure as anything else and especially as a soft Underworld reboot."
" I Truly Wanted this to be Good...
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,3,"I really did want to like this movie, I really did. Theo James was one of the few welcome additions to Underworld: Awakening, and looked forward to his part in Blood Wars. And, for the most part, I enjoyed the role he played and his performance. But between the weak character development and the seemingly brief, rushed plot connections that should have instead more of a focal point at this point in the saga, I just felt so disappointed by this. I still got the expected satisfaction of vampire and werewolf bloodshed, but the addition of snow Selene with magic transportation powers and the ripping out of backbones, it all just seemed like a little too much... even for an Underworld installation. In this sense it seemed reminiscent of the unnecessary 'Tomb of the Dragon Emperor' installment of The Mummy franchise.Anyways, if you've followed the series up to this point, it's definitely necessary to see this movie. However I wouldn't expect much. And if you're going in with no Underworld background, you may honestly enjoy this movie a little more. Sorry, Selene, I've got to go with the critics on this one.3/10"
" Great movie and story but horribly dark to watch as it's 10% visible.
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,4,"This movie has great story, fight scenes and actors. It deserves 8 stars. However, this movie is horribly dark the whole length. You have to stress eyes to see what's going on. Many times you can't even see who's fighting whom. Horrible lighting. Whoever thought of making this movie dark is dumb. Yes, it is vampire movie and they live in dark but that doesn't mean viewers have to suffer. We can imagine the scene is at night even with little more light. With little bit brighter scenes, this is a great movie but as is, terrible to watch. My eyes hurt after watching it as I was trying to see the entire movie squeezing my eyes to figure out what's in there. Stupid dark!"
" Generic
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,3,"The problem with this film is the story elements are weak and thus you are left with a long action flick. It is the same problem people have with Michael Bay. Its boring. The story is just Blade with a side of Riddick using similarly old special effects and a female lead wearing tight pants (which is also tired and overdone). Granted the entire series is not original, but at least they tried to develop characters in the past even if the love angles were terrible. This one has no development... okay I am lying, I would say the development reminded me of a 80's episode of Transformers. About 15 seconds of development, then you have action.Still its better than other garbage like Twilight or Originals and all those other teen trash shows. But I think its time to stick a fork in this series."
" Sad that it didn't live up to its predecessors
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,5,"I am a HUGE fan of the Udnerworld franchise and have been looking forward to this for so long so I am truly sad that my review is not better than this. Here's what I feel is wrong with this movie.1. Marius - who is he, where did he come from? The explanation for his power came too late, too little to care and he was not as scary as previous Underworld villains. So is the other vamp chick who is supposed to be power hungry, kind of underwhelming at best.2. Movie is way too short and too rushed. Everything is introduced too quickly and fits into the puzzle too easily. We have never heard of this Nordic vamps till now. There's no continuity, no cohesion. Its like its trying to bring something new BUT this is no. 5 or no. 6?3. The white hair vamps. Seriously I thought the elves from LOTR is doing a crossover.4. Selene went into the water metamorphosis and they didn't even bother to show her experience. Suddenly she's back from the other end of the world so fast and all ready super powered. It doesn't make sense and we don't understand her journey.5. The CGI is really quite bad.6. The whole point of the movie is all about finding Eve's blood and they attacked just fine without it. If Eve is not even going to make an appearance then talking about her for more than half a movie just feels like a plot filler.7. Suddenly that other guy is the heir to the throne. Where did that come from?? I think the writers think this is going to be so cool but not if it likes a pie in the face kind of idea. Shock value goes whoa not huh?8. Selene was invited to train vamps and I think it barely lasted a few mins of training before the treachery was unearthed. Could they not let the training last maybe a few days before they started juicing her?9. Semira's right hand man never showed any indication that he might betray her but suddenly he did. Some build up would be great.10. The elves need more screen time!Kate Beckinsale and Theo James were still awesome but they could have used some better scenes to instill a better relationship. The movie was fun, entertaining and but it fell flat and it left me feeling all empty inside and for that reason, I am SAD."
" Total disaster that never should have been made
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,2,"If you thought this movie will start in a nice way firstly from Split which was magnificent now we have a contender for the worst film of the year. World of vampires and Lycans is taking us to battle for most precious blood of all, Eve's blood. And what a mess of a movie did Anna Foerster did for her first directorial movie followed by a horrible plot telling. From narration of movie which is annoyingly dull, to totally unrealistic CGI which wasn't used much but when it was used, oh did it look cartoon like, it was worse even from first Underworld that came out almost 15 years ago. Plot is so utterly disgusting because it keeps jumping from one action to another and from another scene to another without any explanation. It was just sad to see how film makers decided to make a movie and throw a dozen of new things and couple of characters and just ignore them and go with fighting between two sides. Even fights were not so entertaining because they were too dark and almost half of fight scenes are unable to be followed. Only Kate deserves to be followed along the movie because the rest of cast seems like they wanted to do something fun but ended doing something horrible. 0.5/4"
" Great but wish they more
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,9,"Underworld: Blood WarsI like the movie. Some viewers think that the movie should die but I highly disagree. I like all the underworlds especially the Michael and Selene relationship. I didn't like the fact that they literally killed off his character, I could be wrong but the the way they handled it was my liking. The ending of the movie was good for the fact that it left it opened ended. If they do plan on making Underworld XI the movie could focus on selene and her daughter or it could to selene daughter based on the ending. The story lines regarding the battle between the two outside of selene in general is what makes the movie. The new director IMHO didn't do a bad job for a 1st. The director stated that what made the 1st so good was the back story and I agree. If the powers that be decide to go small screen route they should really consider going via Netflix. If they plan on going small screen and use Netflix they can soo much more with violence, sex scenes and all the good stuff that make shows like marvel based Netflix series soo good."
" The Plot .. Is Not
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,5,"In the 2006 film CLICK (a throwback to a strange era when Adam Sandler was considered one of the most bankable stars in Hollywood) a very hammy Chris Walken, playing the Devil, takes a moment to tell Sandler (playing the husband) of Beckinsale, in all seriousness, and with a straight face, ""Your wife is smoking hot."" Which in a nutshell explains the staying power of Underworld I, a film I have seen perhaps 8 times so far. It combined a kickass script with great action sequences and featured Kate as perhaps the sexiest vampire in film history.Flash forward through several sequels (too many) and we still have Kate ... but little else. One of the worse scripts in recent memory, so bad it verily fails the late Roger Ebert's ""20 minute test"" (if a film fails to hook up in the first 20 minutes, leave the theatre).Horrible story, horrible characters, and overall a pretty rotten movie.Advice -- go see the first one all over again. You'll thank me in the morning,"
" Absolutely dreadful and that's coming from an Underworld fan.
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,1,"Lacks everything that made the original and sequels interesting. Poorly cast actors especially Pulver, too much use of guns with lack of physical fight scenes, no gore, bad script, uninteresting dialogue, overall weak story line, irrelevant flashbacks, lack of vampire elders or any character depth in werewolves removes the lore and legend that made the franchise interesting. I did not care who lived or died and honestly feel i am owed an hour and 31 minutes of my life. Maries might of well as been called Mario and adorned himself in a red cap and overalls would of been just as threatening. Absolutely no character depth what so ever which is polar opposite to the first films in this franchise. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME IF YOU LIKE UNDERWORLD YOU ARE BETTER OFF NOT SEEING THIS IT IS A TRAVESTY AND MIGHT AS WELL OF STARRED DANNY DYER."
" Meh movie. The saga continues.....
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,4,"Pretty boring movie I must say. Now that I'm done watching it, I can barely remember what happened! Lol. What was the plot of the movie again? I am a fan of the underworld movies, I like Salem; her character, but it seems this series has gotten worse as it goes on. At least this and the one before.This series needs some new life! The scenes are stylish and eye appealing. Few nice CGI scenes. All in all very unmemorable movie in my opinion. But if you've watched the previous instalments before, you're probably going to watch this, so be prepared for a let down."
" When Will This Culture War End?
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,6,"""Blood Wars"" is simply put just another addition to the ongoing tale about the fight between the Lycans and the Vampires as it picks up after the previous film ""Awakening"". If you've been following the series up to this point, you're not missing much. There are no big reveals, or important changes to characters. It's just another Underworld flick with the usual stylized action and visuals. It's still enjoyable, but there's simply nothing new to bring to the table here. If you haven't been following the films up to this point, you'll either enjoy it for the action and style, or you'll just be left bored and confused with what the point of this war they're fighting is. Underworld was born from the Gothic subculture that ruled the early to mid 2000s, and Blood Wars is a relic of that. If you've been following the films since then, you'll enjoy the film for what it is, and what it represents. Otherwise, you'll be left with another drawn out addition to a series that needs to be put down."
" Without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,1,"I am a big fan of the Underworld series. I have watched every entry at least a dozen times, and own the whole collection on blu-ray. Naturally, I was comfortable assuming that would have some bearing on my enjoyment of this movie, and I could not have been more wrong. It's not even that this is just a bad Underworld movie, it is a horrendous movie all by itself. This movie has the worst plot, dialogue, acting, action, and just about everything else that I have EVER seen. My best friend and my wife, who I unfortunately took to see this monstrosity in the theater, have now banned me from picking the movies we go watch. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE."
" Borderline spoof, super rushed.
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,3,"Now, I'm familiar with the first two films, but I'll be honest, all that I can remember well is Kate Beckinsale in tightly cladded, black leather, looking like a hotter CatWoman, but in fact, she's a blood sucking bat woman. I didn't even know there was another two films! Rise of Lycans that was without Beckinsale (that might have something to do with it) and Awakening which did have Beckinsale. TV director and cinematographer, Anna Foerster makes this her big screen debut, but it's not a good start. It's not horrendous and is properly a good opportunity out of a bad situation, however this unfortunately puts doubts in my mind about her Source Code 2 that's in currently in development. I'm not sure what I missed but there appears to be a lot of back stabbing, characters defecting or returning for redemption. For someone who has skipped the previous two, it didn't really make much sense with the flashbacks but it's not really hard to figure out and follow. It's unfortunately a messy and poorly scripted story, drowning in borrowed elements from other films, making it awfully predictable where it tries to be clever. One scene in particular immediately reminded me the battle at Helm's Deep in LotRs Two Towers. It's very rushed and it progresses faster than their superhuman healing powers. One minute they're on a train, then they're riding horses across a snow plain to all of sudden scaling a cliffside. Just seemed utterly pointless and stupid. There are characters and story elements that get introduced but are quickly pushed to one side to make way for more plot lines or twists, the side characters especially are not developed enough. Beckinsale fits into her right leather comfortably but she isn't in the film as much as I was expecting, giving some of the story to Theo James' David. Again, because of this rushed though balanced storyline, you never feel like you're getting the full picture and being a fan of James, I believe he's capable of giving so much more. I want to see how he does on the frontline, they should give him a superhero tryout. The action was as expected, decent enough to be entertaining but the bullet dodging makes it borderline spoof; and what's with all the grunting during the dramatic stand off scenes!? David grunts cuts to Marius grunting back, David grunts some more, Marius I think sighs and grunts at the same time, only more intense. This goes on for what feels like a good thirty seconds! I didn't feel anything with the bad guys, in fact, I felt little for any of the characters. Marius, played by Tobias Menzies, wasn't really bad enough, don't know what to make of him. And Lara Pulver's Semira just appeared to be a cheap version of most of Eva Green's nasties. I can't speak for the previous sequels but the first film boasted a decent soundtrack with tracks from Bowie, A Perfect Circle and Amy Lee from Evanescence, something that's the expected from this sub-genre of movies. Michael Wandmacher composes a fitting score but nothing memorable, and all sounds very much the same throughout. It appears I don't have anything good to say about this movie, however, if I was of a younger generation of movie-goer, I might enjoy this as a brainless action fantasy flick. But I ended up laughing at a lot of it, especially the bullet dodging. It's not worthy of the big ticket price and it really doesn't urge me to watch the rest of franchise.

" Better than I was expecting
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,8,"I had a free movie ticket so I decided to see Underworld: Blood Wars, even though I really didn't like the last movie. This one is worth the price of a free ticket, so take that as you will.Grade: A- Numerical Grade: 9.1/10Plot: 7/10 The writers seemed to have remembered what made Underworld so great: Death Dealers killing Lycans, Lycans killing Death Dealers, with a very minor story connecting the fighting. This is both good and bad because while the story was a tiny bit weak, at least it was solid enough to make you enjoy the movie. The actions scenes were well done, you cared enough about the characters that you weren't bored, and (thankfully), they seemed to end the franchise.Character Development: 8/10 Selene was back in form in this movie, no longer moping over Michael, though she still missed him. But she was back to major kick-ass form, especially at the end. Semira was probably the best villain I've seen in this type of movie in a long time, and she really added to the overall feel of the movie. David was okay as a fight-partner for Selene, but he wasn't great. He worked, though. The Lycans and Death Dealers also had good motivation and you could see where they were coming from and why they were doing what they were doing.Director: 9/10 First movie by Anna Foerster that I remember seeing, and she did a really good job, giving me a good Underworld movie that I won't mind adding to my collection when it comes out on digital download. Don't think this movie deserves Steelbook, though--none of the Underworld movies do.Casting: 9/10 I liked everyone in this movie, other than Tobias Menzies, who really did not fit the role of Marius. Charles Dance was perfect in his role as Thomas, one of the elder vampires. Kate Beckinsale was stunning, as usual. Theo James was...well...Theo James.Acting: 9/10 Everyone pretty much played their part exactly as you expected they would, except Tobias Menzies who just didn't seem to really care. He was about the only person who didn't give it an effort.Cinematography: 10/10 The film was beautiful, Gothic and eerie and dark, very much like a classic vampire movie with modern vampires. Brilliant!Music: 10/10 Music fit the movie perfectly.Pacing: 10/10 Didn't check my watch once. Movie flowed well, didn't drag for too long, and the action was paced well throughout.Sets and Costumes: 10/10 Loved the look of the sets, loved the costumes. Those are two things these movies have always done well.Enjoyment: 9/10 I did enjoyed this movie for what it was. It was not the greatest movie I've ever seen, but I do like the Underworld movies overall. They have problems, but the overall story is good. If you like the Underworld movies, give this one a watch at some point, even if not in theaters. If you hated the movies, avoid this one.Ranking: I was surprised when I ranked the Underworld movies.Underworld: Blood Wars Underworld: Evolution Underworld: Awakening Underworld: Rise of the Lycans Underworld"
" Super-Woman
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,1,"This film is ridiculous from the beginning. It's a story about an egocentric, especially strong Super-Woman. Nobody needs such sluts! Another Try to build a female Terminator. Another Try to impose feminism to the society. Another part in the propaganda-puzzle, to destroy traditional families and support lesbians as a normally alternative of partnerships. That's the way to make politics today. You maybe only see an Action-Movie, but the secret messages are going directly in your subconscious. Believe it or not. Hollywood makes politics, since decades. It wont take a long time and the first propaganda-movie against Donald Trump will appear in the cinemas."
" Underworld: Blood Wars

You know what that means, more shitty horror movies! But hey this is a guilty pleasure of mine, I love the first three underworld movies, they're great films in my opinion but Awakening was an unnecessary pile of trash. They should have ended it with the prequel Rise of The Lycans. As we once again get a prologue to past events from the other four movies (much like those even worse Resident Evil Movies which doesn't even have one good film under there belt) we find Selene as an outcast being hunted down by a new Lycan leader Marius, who is looking for Selene's daughter which they don't even say her name if she even has one. He wants her blood because she's pure-blood which would make him and anyone else who drank it really powerful. The film is very short if it weren't for the fact that I liked Selene I would have forgotten I saw this movie. This one doesn't feel as cool as the last one (and the last one was awful but you could still have a good time) that would be the pacing's fault it feels so rushed that it almost wants to get it over and it has the same run time as Rise of The Lycans and that ones great. However with that being said you know what your getting when you see the trailers and the fact that it's a horror movie in January. Your getting an awful film that can be enjoyed and while it was a poorly made film I thought it was fine. This isn't my favorite in the series not even in the top three of course. But if you want to just have fun in the movies and you like horror (like I do) then go see it if you so wish. I'm giving Underworld: Blood Wars a two out of five."
" Lackluster but decent ""end"" to the franchise.
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,6,"So supposedly this will be the last underworld film (but I'm sure if this makes a ton of money they'll make another one), But if it is I must admit I'll miss the franchise.Along with Resident Evil (Which will also end its franchise this year) the Underworld movies were this long running super cheesy mediocre action sci-fi flicks that starred a hot chick kicking ass and taken names, which was great to watch.Say what you will, I'm sure all of us enjoyed watching this guilty pleasure. You can't help loving the concept of the film about vampires going to war with werewolves and you went to see them hoping they would get better, but they didn't, but you still hoped, so you still went and they keep making them because of it, but they never got better (but they didn't really get worse at least).So as we come to the end, Blood Wars once again stars Kate Beckinsale looking cool doing all the fight scenes, which is the most important part, as the vampires request her help yet again against the werewolves, which did generate some pretty cool action sequences.So no matter how mediocre Blood Wars and the others that came before it are. I'll still miss going on eating my popcorn turning my mind off for two hours to watch Beckinsale use movie magic to come off like a warrior queen. It really is good for that."
" Underworld: Cliché Wars

And characters who they couldn't afford to cast are lazily written out of the story. The ending of the movie is just sort of tacked on giving little weight to the enormity of what it actually would mean for future films of which they seem to set up.All in all, it's an Underworld movie, just probably the worst one.If you've seen any of the other entries into the Underworld universe than you won't really be surprised at what you get with this one."

",2017-01-23 00:00:00,10,Underworld blood Wars is a instant horror classic that will be remembered for years and years from now. The acting was flawless the movie itself was just pure amazing that you will wish it would never end. When I saw this movie I saw it in 3D and it was some of the best 3D I have ever seen in my whole life. This movie was one of those films where you are like wow now that is what I call a great movie. This movie will make you fall in love with movies againParents this is a R rated movie for a great reason and that reason is because of bloody violence. If you don't think your kids should see this movie then they should not see it because it is bloodtastic. This is what I call a great horror film and I hope you enjoy this masterpiece
" Writers bringing down this franchise
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,4,"I love this series BUT the scriptwriters are making the plots pitiful. Selene is becoming more predictable and considering she's the #1 Lycan Killer she's showing a soft side. I would recommend seeing this ONLY IF you're an avid fan but DON'T pay full price! Good: Selene continues to show skills and gets some new ones.Continuity of characters.Storyline remains consistent.Bad: Compacting too much of the story-line just too keep action flowing.Inconsistent displays of vampire strength and powers.Ease of vampire gullibilityAt least we can expect at least one more film to give them a chance to bring it up to par, sigh..."
" Underworld: Blood Wars (2017)
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,6,"My first experience of film from 2017 happens to be the latest installment in a series that I am extremely mixed on. I love the original Underworld. I loved the universe created and thought it was a well crafted action film with a good balance of both style and substance. Unfortunately, none of the sequels were close in quality to the original and a few of the films kind of just faded into the background. I wasn't overly excited for Blood Wars but all I really wanted was a decent film that is at least better than some of the sequels.The film starts off explaining some of the key events of the previous in the franchise (which I really needed as a refresher). It takes a while for the film to really get going. We see a few new characters, all with their own motivations. You really wonder who is doing what and it takes time to really frame the story. I felt uninterested through the first act. The film does get better once we see more of Tobias Menzies' villainous character. I think with so many films in the franchise its easy to forget characters and all about the vampire/werewolf hybrids and what the Lycans are really after.Kate Beckinsale is gorgeous as always in the film. Her Selene character always kicks ass and looks incredibly sexy in a black leather suit. I also dug remodeling her character with the blondish locks in her hair. The dark blue hue of the film is back once again but its cool because the film looks really stylish and the Gothic feel of the Underworld universe is ever present. There's more than enough action and bloody violence to keep the moviegoer entertained. Its important to remember that these films are gearing more towards popcorn entertainment than something that can be take seriously as a cinematic work.I think the introduction of Tobias Menzies' is such a strong point. The man plays one of the most despicable villains I have ever seen on television in Outlander. Just channeling a fraction of the hate in that character is enough for you to get invested in the hate for his character. Some of the other characters kind of fade away and feel incomplete but there's enough fun going on to allow you to forgive some of the film's shortcomings.I think with Blood Wars we get the film series' most satisfying sequel despite being flawed. The film is still as stylish as ever and a stronger third act keeps the fuel in the machine. I wouldn't mind if the series ended soon but I think we may have to go through a film or two before the series is at its conclusion. Overall, its nothing special but still better than what I had expected.6.5/10"
" Spoilers
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,5,I did enjoy the film but its only a film you would watch once as it was pretty ridiculous in some places. Like 10 different plot twists and characters betrayal it was like watching Jeremy Kyle. ... Also Selene dies in one scene then she comes back at the end with a perfect ombre hair cut i mean wtf??? there is a war going on when did she have time to visit the hairdressers???? ... Most the movie was ridiculous which is a shame because i really enjoyed the first three. ... Also the end didn't really live up to the climax because if it was that easy to rip out his spine she really could have just done that from the beginning!Good fighting scenes and Kate Beckensale in leather makes up for the crap story line though :)
" The Fifth ""Underworld"" Isn't As Good . . .
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,8,"The lavish but loquacious vampire versus werewolf extravaganza in Gothic horror, ""Underworld: Blood Wars,"" doesn't deliver as many bold, spectacular stunts either genuine or CGI as the previous four films in this supernatural series. If you're counting, ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" is number five in this British-produced series dating back to 2003 with the original ""Underworld."" One thing that can be said about this imaginative franchise is its fan-friendly approach. Like ""Underworld: Awakening,"" ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" recaps all the skulduggery at the outset lest our memories have faded since the last clash between the vampires and werewolves. ""Blood Wars"" offers a similar prologue that seems identical aside from a bit tacked on at the end. Former television director Anna Foerster's first film coughs up loads of exposition. This creates obvious problems because she pauses the action for the leading characters to exchange dialogue galore. You know the characters aren't chatting among themselves as much as they are uttering information for our eavesdropping ears. ""Last Witch Hunter"" scenarist Cory Goodman and ""Machete Kills"" writer Kyle Ward give feuding factions a great deal to say. American action movies don't present half as much verbiage as Goodman and Ward have in ""Underworld: Blood Wars."" Indeed, a score card wouldn't be out of the question to keep up with everything clear that they cover. The boisterous, R-rated, battle sequences that ensue appear visually lackluster. Instead of svelte Kate Beckinsale cavorting nimbly about in a black cat-suit with pistols blazing and Lycans dying, armies of vampires and werewolves equipped with body armor blast away at each other with assault weapons. These cacophonous skirmishes are comparably bland and would seem more appropriate in a ""G.I. Joe"" actioneer. At its best, the ""Underworld"" franchise resembles a swashbuckling spectacle rather than a military marching campaign. Despite the plethora of dialogue and monotonous maneuvers, ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" boasts not only revelations about characters new and old but also narrative surprises and enhanced Lycan weaponry. The opening recap brings us up-to-date on the ""Underworld"" franchise, specifically the complicated relationship between our 1000-year-old heroine Selene and her hybrid daughter Eve (India Eisley) who is virtually never seen unlike her introduction in the the earlier installment ""Underworld: Awakening"" where she ripped apart Lycans. Nevertheless, heroes and villains alike talk about the offspring of Selene and Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman) constantly talk about or perform tasks related to Selene's daughter. Anybody who hasn't seen the earlier ""Underworld"" outings should know that after introducing the primary characters and their antagonists in the first two movies, the third film served as a prequel, with Rhona Mitra as Viktor's daughter Sonja instead of Kate Beckinsale as the Lycan killing assassin Selene. ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" (2009) was released after ""Underworld"" (2003) and ""Underworld: Evolution"" (2006). The third film provided the origins of events and characters that occurred in the two earlier epics. The vampires and Lycans in the ""Underworld"" franchise do not adhere entirely to the venerable Universal Studios prototypes of the ""Dracula"" and ""Wolf Man"" franchises. The Universal monsters owed their origins to supernatural intervention, while a virus spawned the ""Underworld"" vampires and Lycans. This explains why Selene as a vampire cannot shape-shift into the bodies either a bat or a wolf like Count Dracula. This also justifies scenes where vampires show up as reflections in mirrors. Mind you, prolonged exposure to the sun is still fatal to the vampires as much as the ultraviolent bullets that the Lycans load into their assault weapons. Anyway, with Michael gone missing, Selene isn't as excited about being a vampire constantly eluding Lycans. Selene's latest Lycan adversary, the aggressive but enigmatic Marius (Tobias Menzies of ""Casino Royale"") isn't as interesting as some of the aristocratic vampires in the surviving Eastern Coven. Marius wears an occupational sneer like a mask, but he lacks the intimidating stature of Selene's earlier adversaries. Marius sends out men to capture Selene and extract from her Eve's whereabouts. Even after he has Selene at his mercy, Marius suppresses his incendiary wrath because she has told him the truth. Simply enough, she doesn't know where Eve has fled. Meantime, David (Theo James of ""Allegiant"") and his suspicious father Thomas (Charles Dance of HBO's ""Game of Thrones"") return. In ""Underworld: Awakening,"" David died, but Selene resurrected him. She inserted her bloody fist into his chest and massaged his heart back to life. These movies deserve credit for conjuring up some wholly outlandish escapades. This time father and son are allowed sanctuary in the impregnable Eastern Coven castle. An Eastern Coven leader, Cassius (James Faulkner of the ""I, Claudius"" television mini-series), brags that his vampire coven has stood fast against the despicable Lycans for fifteen centuries. Little does he realize that the Eastern Coven has its own quislings, and one of the worst serves alongside him on the elders' council, Semira (Laura Pulver of ""Edge of Tomorrow""), who conceals her treachery beneath a deceitful smile. She insists that Cassius and the council grant amnesty to the outcast Selene, now relentlessly pursued by vampires and Lycans both, and persuade her to tutor their latest generation of werewolf-killing, death-dealers so the Eastern Coven can repel future Lycan incursions.Occasionally, ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" borders on convolution. The larger-than-life death scenes are memorable because our heroes and heroines vanquish the villains with style to spare. At one point, after triggering hundreds of bullets into each other, Marius and David howl in fury, and all the slugs they have riddled themselves with catapult from their wounds. Forester stages this encounter is kinetic gusto. Later, the scheming Semira wields a sword against David who has more than enough reason to skewer this wicked wench. Apart from the new villains, the albino Nordic Clan with their striking white coiffures and fascinating cultural rituals, one involving a mysterious kind of waterborne mummification, are introduced in the third quarter. ""Underworld: Blood Wars"" compensates for its dreary fireworks and surplus of dialogue with exemplary death scenes and compelling revelations."

" What you expected it to be, a fast, brainless, bloody action movie that will mostly entertain fans of the series and people with short attention spans
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,5,"A fifth entry in the Underworld franchise and it still doesn't seem to stop there. At this point, I think we can all expect to leave our brains at home and just go in for a pure bloody action. And that's what I suggest you all to do. There are so many stories going here that you don't even have to care or pay attention to understand what's going on as well as new characters added just to make the action parts more chaotic and entertaining to watch. Even though there are some bad CGI moments along with its unoriginal plot, but there are still lots of twists and turns and gleefully GORY action sequences for horror fans to enjoy throughout. Overall, Underworld: Blood Wars is what you expected it to be, a fast, brainless, bloody action movie with enough surprises, blood, and body counts that will mostly entertain fans of the series and people with short attention spans.

" Fast, ferocious, and brilliantly stupid...
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,5,I must preface this review by noting that I have had no prior connection to the 'Underworld' series. I went in without having seen any of them. My girlfriend wanted to go see it and said it would hopefully be a good bad. In the long run she was right It's bad and I mean really bad. Fortunately it's bad in the best kind of bad. The film has a hilarious streak and not in a 'Batman v. Superman' way. It's always sort of hard to decipher good/bad from bad/bad. The one thing that 'Underworld Blood Wars' has going for it is that it's cast commits to the material with stone cold sincerity. I laughed a lot mainly because a lot of the film is actors desperately trying to elevate garbage material. The main thing with 'Underworld Blood Wars' is that so much of it has been about building the world and leaving bread crumbs for countless future sequels. When our vampires are not fighting they are bickering about bureaucracy and prophecies. I usually hate that kind of stuff but here it is so haphazardly added in that the bad screen writing is almost overwhelmingly blunt. The fact that our cast treats it like it's Shakespeare really does sell it enough to have a chuckle.The juxtaposition between these scenes of vampire bureaucrats and the action might be what make the film work. The action sequences are clichéd too right down to the ending when Selene returns with white streaks in her hair to show she really means business. It's funny. I admire the commitment of the actors but sometimes it's just fun to snicker at a ham.I was not bored by 'Underworld' at all. It's bad but it's too well oiled a cliché to fume over.
" The return of selene
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"Five years since the events of the last movie underworld awakening, Selene is a hunted fugitive by both the Lycans aka werewolves and the death dealers aka the vampires. Selene daughter eve has been placed into hiding for her own protection knowing that both enemies want her daughter blood to create more hybrids. Selene is once again paired with her ally David and his father David who speak to the vampire clan to allow her clemency for her past crimes. However Selene faces new threats including the new Lycan leader Marius and vampire Samira who wants Selene blood to make herself more powerful. I would say that what makes the film great is the fast pace and action, however I wish it had a longer running time than just 91 minutes, I also wish Michael would have had a more active role in the story."
" Although entertaining, I still ask myself what was the point.
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"I mean why keep this franchise going, I was satisfied how Underworld Evolution(2006) ended, and didn't really care for the prequel. But too it going with Underworld Awaking(2012) and this make me hope They don't bring back The Matrix series, they'll just run that in the ground, like there doing here, although I have hope for the new Star Wars films.Now am I saying that Underworld: Blood Wars is bad, well no. It's entertaining to say the least, action scenes are quite effective, fight scenes don't disappoint. Kate Beckinsale really plays the role of Selene well, never seems to be sleepwalking through it. Effects go a little over the top with the CGI, but still okay in spots. This is not a film to go in for the meaning of life, it was entertaining, nothing more."
" Not as bad as many will make it seem
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"Underworld: Blood Wars is not as good as underworld evolution, but this doesn't mean it's terrible. I do actually prefer this installment to the first underworld. Kate Beckinsale is still good as seline. And Theo is good as David. The action sequences are well constructed for the most part, pretty much the same as the previous installments, guns galore, bullets flying everywhere, kicking and punching, so the fans of action will certainly not be disappointed. The dialogue is alright, it's not overly cheesy, which is kinda typical in these types of films, but it's also not anything that'll win any major awards. The plot follows up after awakening and I thought the plot was executed pretty well, it keeps your attention all the way through. And there is a remembrance of Michael and his character is alluded to on several times, which I loved because I really liked his character. If you're an underworld fan, you'll enjoy this movie and I certainly did. 7/10."
" A further extension of the Underworld franchise
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,5,"The culmination of the Underworld series so far feels like just another episode and though there is really nothing new despite the insistence that there is by the characters, it is still an enjoyable ride for loyal fans. I happen to have a strong affection for R-rated genre action films so I'm willing to except some major flaws and still have a decent time at the theaters. One aspect of the Underworld films that has increased through the series is the length as each film feels shorter though I don't know the actual run time for each movie. This film felt extra short.Selene (Kate Beckinsale) returns as a renegade chased by both vampires and lycans. With the help of David (Theo James), Selene escapes from the wolves that hunt her. The lycans rallied from the events of the previous films with a new leader, Marius (Tobias Menzies). Menzies has been fun to watch lately especially in his role in Outlander as Black Jack Randall. He's got the vicious villain look down and brings that to this short film.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
" Turn brain off and enjoy
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,8,"Goes without saying from the rating I really enjoyed the movie. When it comes to the underworld series, I pretty much liked all of them so far (Awakening was a big meh but still OK).So lets just start by saying the obvious, if you didn't really liked any of the movies in the series so far, you will not like this.Second thing, if you really loved and are a fan of the series, you might also have some problems with the movie if you over analyze the plot, since there are some good sized plot holes when looking over the entire events that happened in the previous movies.That all being said, the movie was pretty damn fun. Great action scenes, some pretty awesome locations to shoot in and in my opinion a pretty satisfying ending if this is the last in the franchise. Again, there are some plot holes in there, but I just got straight past them and was never bored during the entire movie."
" better then Awakening
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,7,"I liked this movie way better then the last one. A lot of action and a good twist to the story involving the vampires. The main issue I had (this part is a spoiler so don't read it if you haven't seen it) is the Killing off of the Michael character. The last movie led up to his return so it was a real let down and not believable the way he died. This was badly written and a lazy & disrespectful way to remove a lead character. Holding him captive by Marius or not including him at all in this chapter would have been better. He needed to be part of this entire series. I like Kate obviously but she can't carry the whole movie. There needs to be a strong male protagonist especially with so many of the good original characters gone. The David character is OK but too young & doesn't have the same chemistry with Selene that Michael had played by Scott Speedman. It makes no sense not to include him, and the series has suffered with his absence. He needs to be brought back in some aspect for the next final movie, even if its just newly filmed flashback scenes with Eve to finish it off!"
" Vampires Vs Werewolves? Yawn!
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,4,"This review of Underworld: Blood Wars is spoiler free ** (2/5) When a new part of an ongoing series hits the big-screen we all expect it to hit a new part hopefully get over the previous films, this doesn't happen with Underworld: Blood Wars in a hope to bring new fans to the series it does the same thing as it's always done for the past four installments that is bring the same generic action with the same bland story filled with the same hobo-esque Lycan clan trying to kill Selene but she always seems to find a way to survive and it seems that Blood Wars' open-ended denouement may suggest that a sixth film is inevitable.Set a short while after the capture of Selene's (Kate Beckinsale) daughter Eve in Underworld: Awakening they captured her for a blood harvest so the vampires can then turn into a more defined form, a vampire corvinus hybrid which essentially means that they are immune to the sun. We open with Selene narrating her story about her betrayal then we shift to her in a gun fight with some of the Lycan clan, she is then joined by David (Theo James) who is her only ally and confidant at this point as she relies on his help when things go bad. She finds out that the Lycan clan have a new leader, Marius (Tobias Menzies) who is forming a new army of reformed werewolves, so she must go back to her coven and train for one last fight. But it soon transpires that this is just a ruse for Semira (Lara Pulver) the new leader of the coven to form a plan for her betrayal after she killed their last leader Viktor, at this point she is almost dying after an intake of nightshade which in lethal doses can be very painful for her. After she is betrayed she must run to find another coven in the north, where she will train and plan her fight with the Lycans and her fellow Vampires who now are hunting her down for capture and if possible death.The story is joined on with the other films in the series with the help of the same generic fight scenes of Selene shooting down or beating her enemies black and blue, which seems to be quite the challenge for first time director Anna Foerster who not only keeps the fights generic but also steers away from the horror aesthetic of the series, so it now feels like an action film with no horror feel whatsoever. While the others in the series were generic, too, they still had some scares to keep the story going. In addition, it seems that this sequel is adding another tired – seemingly futile attempt to add new fans. There is even less of a story this time it seems that Foerster wanted to rush and just use a lot of action to try to improve the series even the addition flashbacks showing the lives of Marius and the life of David and his father Thomas (Charles Dance), can't quite tackle the overbearing sense of clichés that have grown tired over the last decade.While Beckinsale is constantly dragged into the film's bullsh*t revenge plot, it's not all bad as there are a couple of notable differences; firstly, in the opening of the second act we are taken to a Nordic coven surrounded by beautiful snow-covered mountains with the inhabitants of the coven wearing soft white furs, secondly there is a scene in which Marius and Selene have a showdown on ice both of which thankfully manage to take us away from the familiar territory of a black and blue colour palette. Even though there are a couple of differences to take us away from the generics of the previous there is still a huge amount of clichés, a lot of action and the same bland story that we had in the previous installments, it seems that there is no more hope left for the Underworld series.VERDICT: Like its heroine Blood Wars has run out of ideas and is riddled with tired old clichés that were exciting thirteen years ago but now are old and have lost their touch in this bloody mess which manages to escape the tropes of the previous movies.4/10 the worst in the series"
" Disappointed; but the action scenes are awesome, and the villain is gorgeous!
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,7,"'UNDERWORLD: BLOOD WARS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The fifth installment in the popular 'vampires vs. werewolves' horror franchise. It once again stars Kate Beckinsale, as the badass action heroine Selene. In this chapter she's trying to prevent the vampire army, and the lycans, from getting ahold of her daughter; and using both their blood to make themselves a more powerful hybrid. The film also costars Theo James, Lara Pulver, Tobias Menzies and Charles Dance. It was directed by first time feature filmmaker Anna Foerster; and it was scripted by Cory Goodman (who also co-wrote the action/horror flicks 'THE LAST WITCH HUNTER' and 'PRIEST') and Kyle Ward (who also co-wrote 'MACHETTE KILLS'). The movie disappointed at the Box Office, and it got mostly negative reviews from critics (but fans seem to mostly like it). I also was disappointed with the film.Both the vampires, and the lycans, are hunting Selene (Beckinsale). They both want Selene to lead her to her daughter; so they can use both the mother and daughter's blood to make themselves much more powerful. Selene doesn't know where her daughter is though; as she promised her she'd leave her alone. She reteams with the vampire David (James) to fight both armies.I was a fan of the original 'UNDERWORLD' movie (and it's first couple of sequels), and I especially like Beckinsale in the lead, but this installment did not interest me at all. The action scenes are all still good in it though, and the gore is cool (and Beckinsale is as awesome as ever). I don't find the mythology involving at all anymore though (and I don't really remember the other films that well). Fans of the series will probably still enjoy it though; and ​Pulver is absolutely awesome (and breathtakingly gorgeous) as the main villain in it. She almost made the movie for me!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_SLO5GYrmps"
" Not Great, but Pretty Par for the Course as Far as Underworld Movies are Concerned
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,5,"I am going to make this a bit of a shorter review than most of my other ones, well because I don't want to spend so much time bashing Underworld:Blood Wars. There are not many good things to say about the movie and a whole lot of bad stuff so I will keep it pretty simple.The plot of Blood Wars leaves off a bit after the events of the previous movie, which brings up the stunning revelation that this is the 5th! movie in the Underworld franchise. Before seeing this one I had not seen an Underworld movie since Evolution in 2006, and while the series has not fallen all that far, the quality has definitely fallen. While the overall plot of Vampires battling Lycans all in the name of who knows what is still present, but there are some things missing. There is no Viktor, no Lucian no Markus, and the omission of these classic characters leaves something to be desired. Marius is a confusing antagonist who's inclusion into this war is puzzling. He just does not bring that same villainous tone that the previous villains have.As I said before I have not seen an Underworld movie in a while, but from my recollection this is the worse use of the staple of the series, blood and gore that I have seen. In the first two the bloodiness and ridiculousness of the gore in the movie was a charming piece, in Blood Wars it seems to get in the way. There is no death that even comes close to Selene's flying face splitting front flip from the first movie, and is instead replaced with an abundance of useless violence. All the best things I can say of this movie are about Kate Beckinsale. You would think she has not aged a day since the first underworld came out in 2003 and she just fits the character so well. So that's basically it, Underworld: Blood Wars is pretty bad, but this universe is just so darn interesting that I can watch an hour an a half of bad movie as long as Vampires will fight Lycans and Kate Beckinsale is in it, and Blood Wars has those things so do with that what you will."
" Top 3 Worst Viewed Movies All-Time
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,1,"Truly an awful, awful movie. Poor acting, atrocious writing, unimaginative sets (really only 3), movie could not end soon enough. Do Not Watch this Movie - don't even pay $.99 on Net Flix. Sewing with Nancy on PBS is vastly more entertaining. So apparently, one must provide 10 lines of text in order to post a review of a movie on IMDb. Thus, I must come up with several more superlatives for describing crap-bad movies.On a scale of Planet 51 to 10, I gave this movie a 1, and my son, knowing fully well the scale starts at 0 and ends at 10, and who is usually, very generous with his informal ratings, gave this movie a -1. Again, this is one of the top 3 worst movies I have ever paid to see in 40 years - avoid at ALL COSTS."
" Very Much for the Fans
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,"This movie is atrocious by all outside metrics - It's slow moving, it's poorly edited, it's painfully contrived, it's noticeably cheap looking andit's kind of fun to watch. Okay, maybe it's a stretch to say that the fifth installment of this morose ode to fang kink is fun to watch. It's clear from the generous amounts of recaps, flash backs and the, oh so overused callbacks the Underworld series (2003-Present) has all but run out of steam. Yet what remains serviceable about this film, the action sequences, the reductive sexuality, the Supernatural (2005-Present) meets Game of Thrones (2011-Present) intrigue, is precisely what the fans want.Underworld: Blood Wars begins with a sloppily edited, voice over recap about our long suffering protagonist's journey from scrappy vampire warrior to bloodsucker pariah, to mother of ""the chosen one."" We then see Selene (Beckinsale) take on a pack of fanatic werewolves whose new leader Marius (Menzies) has a vested interest in Selene's daughter's blood. Problem is Selene doesn't know where her daughter is – the lycans, don't know where her daughter is – the vampire clan shoehorned into this movie, also don't know where her daughter is! Seriously has no one called for an Amber Alert at this point? Selene is then wrapped up into the palace intrigue of a prestigious vampire coven, led by Semira (Pulver) whose nefarious plans are as webbed and needlessly contrived as her outfits. Watching this film spill its yarn was like enduring the uncomfortable S&M fantasies of a zealous Dungeons and Dragons DM. There's half-thought-out drivel about pure blood vampire lines, Selene somehow harnessing the power to create mirages, the war between vampires and lycans which is always a fixture – then there are the elves. The movie explains they're a secluded coven of vampires but no, they're f***ing elves! There's a lot of ridiculousness in this film is my point and not a single scene goes on without elongated monologues spouting exposition. Yet while the machinery of Blood Wars loudly chugs along, a recalibration is happening. In the mix are series holdovers David (T. James) and lead vampire daddy Thomas (Dance), whose character arcs clunkily reach some kind of resolution. Our villain Marius likewise borrows up-in-the-air elements from earlier installments and clumsily curb stomps them so they'll (hopefully) never be mentioned again. Add to all this the fact that you never actually find out what happened to the daughter and it feels to me that the series is slicing on through and then asking for a mulligan.It's all very obvious and at times too cringe-worthy to bear, but with so many scenes littered in form-fitting leather, it's now possible to conclude this series finally knows what its doing. I mean come on, the film goes so far as to introduce the baby-faced Alexia (Head) and the chiseled Vargas (B. James); two characters whose main jobs are to be sexual props for other characters. From the fan's perspective, this IP essentially amounts to nothing more than elaborate Gothic role-play, faux elegant depictions of bloodletting, cool ninja warrior acrobatics and a female protagonist who gets off on being hurt. I'm not saying I approve but having our hero rip out a werewolf's spine while in a literal cage is arguably better than the Romeo and Juliet bulls**t we got in the first one."
" The Bad Chick in Black is Back
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"I watch the Underworld movies for pure action, a little bit of story, and seeing a bad chick kicking butt. As far as girl power movies go, the Underworld franchise is one of--if not--my favorite.Underworld: Blood Wars was, of course, more of Selene (Kate Beckinsale) being the bad B in black. She was still on the lam hiding from both Vampires and Lycans. She had to deal with Marius (Edmure Tully err uh Tobias Menzies) this new and improved Lycan leader and Thomas (Tywin Lannister err uh Charles Dance) an old guard Vampire. The movie offered me what I was looking for. I'm not some Vampire or Lycan purist. I don't mind their story being retold in different ways or their core attributes being altered as well. Did they get after it? Were there some ooh and aah moments? Yes and yes. I found myself oohing and aahing a few times (or more correctly saying OH and DAM!). I will say that there was one drawback. The last installment was 2012, five years ago--the one before that was 2009 and the one before that was 2006 and the one before that was 2003. My point being that, whereas Selene does do a narrative recap at the beginning it wasn't nearly enough to totally refresh my memory on who everyone was and why they all hate her. I'd seen all of them but only once and it wasn't like I memorized characters or even the central theme of the four previous episodes. This movie was still able to stand on its own even with the brief synopsis of how she got to the point she was at. It's a solid movie that can be viewed all on its own if one should choose to."
" A poor addition to the series
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,4,"This addition to the series came as a disappointment. It was clear from one of the first scenes that the quality had lapsed. When Charles and Semira are having their first private conversation the camera work is just awful - flipping back and forth like a tennis match, with increasingly poor timing and predictable camera movement, tacked on to a weak script. Scenes like this throughout the movie just corrupt the tension and drama of better scenes. There are some plot holes that I see mentioned in other comments so I won't add them. I feel that the director here really did a poor job of quality control. The animations and action scenes and Gothic graphics are all fine, it just completely lacks the consistency that make the first few movies work so smoothly together."
" When you slog through all of Disney's hype . . .
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,". . . which saga is REALLY more appealing: STAR WARS or Sony Pictures' BLOOD WARS? The latest episodes in both series--playing side-by-side in America's Multiplexes Today--both feature largely Foreign casts and crews, not to mention international filming locations. However, there's much to be said about several areas in which UNDERWORLD: BLOOD WARS may have an edge against ROGUE ONE: A STAR WARS STORY. First of all, the brains behind BLOOD WARS are willing to send casting crews out into the World in search of Fresh Blood, while the cheap lazy folks at Disney are clinging desperately to some on-screen talent that's been dead and buried for more than 30 years, as they continue to suck the U.S. Congress like a vampire in order to stretch their Copyrights of the Living Dead way beyond the Grave. Secondly, BLOOD WARS proves that there are plenty of battles to be fought right here on Planet Earth, with no need to fabricate Fairy Tale Galaxies ""far, far away."" Finally, watching ""fighting"" in STAR WARS is akin to seeing a plethora of pulled punches in a Roy Rogers Western from the 1900s. So come on over to BLOOD WARS' Dark Side if you think that you can handle The Truth (about violent story-telling and everything else--or do you still want The Farce to be with you?)."
" Fun, cool movie
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,10,I don't understand why people don't like this movie.I wonder what they expect when they go in. It's a great story line: 1. Selene finds out about a few things that are important for her about her story that we all know.2. A very cool thing happens to her and the movie is interesting and has action from the very moment it starts. 3. No sappy romantic anything. 4. Very entertaining. 5. Keep in mind that this is fantasy and its goal is to keep you entertained.I can't wait to see what happens next since the end means there have to be other things following. It cannot end just like that.
" What?
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,5,"FYI, this review is on the negatives of the film, and won't go over any of the positives. The storyline is somewhat compelling, which merits a six. The action is kinda good.However the cinematography is choppy, the segues adrupt and awkward, the plot was more confusing than not and, though kinda interesting, lacked cohesion and spark. The diologue lacked as well, with basic uninteresting monologues and disjointed poetry. Some of the design choices for the hair and clothing of certain characters didn't seem to suit them, and some of the outfits were so obviously stiff that the actors movements were reduced to jerky wooden puppeting. Overall a disappointing film. I recommend waiting for it to come out on redbox."
" Selene Returns into a decent fifth installment!
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,5,"Underworld: Blood Wars is the fifth film in the Gothic vampire/werewolf film which shows that it may be running off its course. I am a fan of the series but loved the first two installments that opened up to werewolf vs. vampire world. The sequels are slowly fading away lacking plot, characterization, and just becoming a fun brainless action films. Blood Wars falls into the category of a forgettable action movie that still has the cool Gothic vampire/lycan concept ideas but less on plot and characterizations. Its the same repeat of a plot from the first movie which lacks the creativity on the direction. Except the first movie was entertaining and had better action sequences. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is caught in the middle of the war between the Lycans led by Marius (Tobias Menzies) and the vampires. With David (Theo James) needing Selene's help, and Marius also looking for her. Cause she is the only one that may know the whereabouts of her daughter Eve (which she has the key of some power). The plot is simple, which these type of films never really focus on. Just setting up the conflict and even losing the focus on some key characters like Selene's daughter and her love interest Michael. Yes, there is plenty of flashbacks for newcomers of the series to make sense of it. The action sequences are poorly executed. First time director Anna Foerster does a poor job with the action, the stunt work, and even the editing was choppy. It also looked like there was no fight choreographer which made every fight scene dull. Even, the shoot out sequences with vampires firing their weapons at the lycans and they are firing back. There was barely any bullet ricocheting or impact to the characters or even the environment. Looks like they are firing with blanks from their guns. Or when Theo James and Tobias Menzies are having a screaming match as they walk towards each other firing their weapons (if they have yet to realize that bullets still has yet to harm them). The climax is not even noteworthy and forgettable from a villain that does not even stand out on his own. Most of the fight scenes are consist of close up camera shots with dim lighting and quick editing cuts to hide away from the terrible fight choreography. Even, the music composer Michael Wandmacher score felt generic and left in the shadows of the movie. Which could have added a tone to the film. Kate Beckinsale is a stunning actress and fierce as Selene. It is nice to see her back as the character for as long as she can. Theo James returning as David, and decent as his character, even though his character has a bigger role this time. I love the concept that it took with Selene and David visiting the Nordic Coven of vampires that are more peacekeepers in their society. And some new characters that are briefly shown with some powerful speedy gift. The first battle at their location with Selene and Marius was somewhat decent as they fight on top of a frozen lake. While the battle from there on becomes anti-climactic. If you are a fan of the series, I will recommend it. Blood Wars is a forgettable sequel, and could have been better handled with the direction."
" Loved It
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,10,"This Underworld movie was really good. I was anticipating it to be a let down since awakening wasn't that great. I sure was wrong, I loved this movie lots of action. The story line was pretty good Im hoping that the next movie is just as good. The only negative thing I can say about the movie was the last fight between Marious and Selene. I was expecting a really brutal, bloody battle in that cage but that wasn't the case. All in all KB's performance was flawless and Theo James did great as well, his character David is a BEAST in this movie. Cant wait to see what the producers/creators have next, PLEASE DON'T cancel this movie saga. Keep up the good work!"
" Wars Is Mediocre Hell
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,7,"Years ago, before vampires were glittering in the sun, another movie chose a darker presentation for the occult world. This series brought a war between the werewolves and vampires, in a stunning action film that sealed Kate Beckinsale as a monster slaying queen. If you've guessed Underworld, you're right, and you can probably guess that the fifth movie is the theme of my latest review. Will the fifth installment keep us enthralled in the centuries long war, or will it turn it to ash like a vampire in the sun. Robbie K is back with another review, and as always I'm here to share my opinions on another movie. Let's get started. LIKES  Better story than four  Cool costumes and design  Underworld Actionsomewhat.For those who liked Underworld Awakening, I don't mean to step on any toes. However, Blood Wars was a much better story for me. Dropping most of the genetic science, this film goes back to the feuding family, Game of Thrones aristocracy we loved in the previous films. Selene's journey through the Vampire politics comes back in full force, teetering the fine line of trust and fear at her race's true intentions. It feels like a traditional Underworld story and provides some answers to the lingering questions and complicated family ties. This is the kind of tale that got us hooked into the series, and fit much better than the proceeding film. In regards to the costumes, I always liked the outfit designs our cast wears. The team once again combines modern with traditional to craft ensembles that represent each factions style. Our vampires take on the rich, aristocratic dresses and tuxes, while the lycans get the urban warrior look that screams grunge. I myself like the northern faction's looks the best, part mystical elf and part deadly vampire that work very well in the winter tundra fortress. Regardless of who you are rooting for, know they will look good doing it. But the biggest selling point of this movie is the action the film brings to the table. Blood Wars certainly has the war theme to it filled with lots of gun play, modern war machines, and more gun play. It takes a step back to the first movie's fight sequences and gives you plenty of CGI death, complete with bloody gore, to fill your appetite. But between the bouts of gunplay, the fifth installment mixes things up with some martial arts and swordplay resulting in some satisfying finishes. The scenes are certainly not the flashiest things to grace the screen, but they fit well in the Underworld Universe. DISLIKES  Too much in one story  Very rushed at times  Plot gaps that follow  Not focusing on other characters  Action short lives/lacking suspenseDespite the improvement in the story, Blood Wars still struggles with balancing the various aspects of the tale. This installment crams a lot of tales into one including redemption, searching for her daughter, weird romances, and a lot more I don't have room to write. While this brings a very diverse plot, it also brings a very rushed delivery, with each arc lacking the details to build suspense and really sell it. Even the editing could have used a little polishing to help organize the story a little better, instead of jumping between all the revelations haphazardly. And despite all the revelations and story arcs in this film, Blood Wars still has plot gaps in it, some strategically used to coax a sixth film, and some unintentional. In addition, I was also disappointed at not exploring more avenues with some of the other characters as well. Yes, the story is about Selene and her new male colleague David, so naturally they would get the most screen time. However, they had new characters they really could have developed to add some more depth to the story. Marius the big bad lycan really could have been an awesome villain and the northern vampire clan leader could have brought a new set of skills to the table to complement Selene. However, they dropped these characters to the backburners and left me disappointed at the lost potential.. Finally let's talk about the action. Yes, the action is fitting of the Underworld series, but it still needs to be better developed for me. Many of the shooting bouts were very simplistic and dry, reduced to a bunch of extras falling or wielding plastic looking guns. In addition, many of the battles are reduced to swarm syndrome where all the extras are shown in a wide pan over that again lacks the details I like to see. And as for the martial arts and sword scenes, well they were mostly short lived that they weren't necessary. They had some really cool ideas, but these fights were either awkwardly placed or so short they aren't worth mentioning. Such a shame when you consider how far they pushed the action all those years ago. There wasn't much urgency to these battles, and I felt kind of bored with them due to the lack of suspense.The VERDICT:Underworld Blood Wars isn't that bad of a movie and probably will deliver what most expect. It took a step back to its roots, and delivered a story that we are all familiar with. However, there was just too much for me in this tale and I wasn't impressed with how lackluster these elements were. In addition, the battles (while fitting) also needed some tweaking to help bring that edge and suspense to make the movie more exciting. Regardless, this reviewer suggests waiting on this film to hit your local Redbox vendor, or at least not see it in 3-D. My scores are:Action/Horror: 7.0 Movie Overall: 5.0"
" Great action flick
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"Me my friends were originally going to see Star Wars Rogue, but got there late, and saw that Underworld was playing, so we're like meh whatever let's see. I seen them all but barely remembered anything except that it was about some vampire vs werewolf war. My friends went in with no info about any Underworld movies.End result, it was a fun super action packed movie that had some fight moments that will make you go ""OHHH SHITT"", majority of all the characters were hot as hell, and in the hour and half we weren't bored once as it was just fight scene after fight scene with little moments of dialogue to further the story.If you're looking for some in depth Oscar worthy movie, this ain't it. If you just want to grab a snack and watch some great fight scenes involving swords, guns and cgi monsters, you'll have a blast."
" Loved Selene and the Nordic woman
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed the movie but I do not get how Michael is dead. In awakening they made it seem like he escaped, now we have some dude who murdered him and pilfered his blood? Also agree with a few of the top reviews here. Last I did not like that Selene got her butt kicked a lot, missed long stretches of the movie and the Michael plot hole smh. Also was weird how they talked all that mess about needing eves blood to do this and that but they still did this and that and almost won had selene not showed up with resources. Why did't selene not murder dude that way from the get go and if going to the other world gives that speed they had why didn't the whole coven do it? AND why did selene let the guy catch her at all. Same with the Nordic woman and why do they sit and wait and watch for the lycans to turn when it takes them 5 minutes to shift in which time they can kill. The Nordic woman watch the lycan shift and then almost died. Also, why do they want the blood when the reason for the war has been resolved when Michael was changed. Why do the lycans keep on? Seems if they back off the vampires would stay in their little covens."
" Will This Vampire War Just End Already?
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,2,"Good grief, more of this vampire and werewolf nonsense? When will this cultural obsession just die already?Oh, that's right, never. Because apparently vampires are immortalWell, after watching Underworld: Blood Wars, you will finally realize how unappealing immortality is. When a war between two mythological species has been going on for five films, don't you think the two sides would have realized by now that neither one will win? After all, if the whole point of the mythology is that nobody can die, what's with all the gun and swordplay?Those scenes of wolves getting mutilated and decapitated may just as well been the most entertaining scenes in this entire series, if you enjoy watching Kill Bill levels of gore without the artistry of the screen. I'm betting you two cents that the existence of this movie comes just for the strange world where guns and swords somehow coexist where vampires rule a democracy.The story makes just as much sense as the 2016 presidential election: Kate Beckinsale (The Aviator, Love & Friendship) plays the highly motivated feminist lead who is out to find her daughter whose blood can end the war and apparently she has this same type of blood too, which she's trying to keep away from the vampire council who want to use it for abusive means well, that was at least the plot I got out of it. There was not enough sense of mythology or coherent history for me to care about anything in this snooze fest.Which is sad, because the potential for a great story is there, if less time was spent sexualizing every woman on screen and more time showing us why we should care about any of the strangely attractive members of this futuristic (yet somehow historical) society.Well, maybe we should be giving this atrocity more credit, seeing how this is director Anna Foerster's first attempt at a feature- length? Nah. If I were to tell the world that this was my first achievement after directing a series of shorts, I'd hide my head in embarrassment. Seriously, Foerster has no idea how to stage actors, especially the teen heartthrob Theo James (Divergent). I'm serious- that guy needs to just quit acting. He has no future in this field.Foerster does have her moments of proving to be potentially good at this directing thing; as she includes a gorgeous view of a snowy landscape blanketed by northern lights, but it's not enough to outweigh the incomprehensible fight choreography that takes the place of character development.There is nothing that Underworld: Blood Wars has to offer besides feelings of dark coldness, kind of like the unfortunate winter season we're living through now. I have no idea who's giving these producers enough money to keep putting on these wastes of talent, but whoever you are: STOP!"
" Big mistake!
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,5,"it was a big mistake to NOT bring Micheal back,he was very important to the story line.The reason why the story was prolonged because it was Micheal's blood or the fact that he was a hybrid that made it so interesting.The hybrid factor gave them MORE content to work with and they so how f-ed it up!The baby was a good addition but a mother and father fighting for their lives would have been even a better story.Everyone could have related to that and not be put off by feeding us kate B story lines for the past two movies.This is the last time for me,we need for the franchise to feature a NEW star to revitalize the story,maybe then the movie could make money but kate b has worn out her welcome in this franchise."
" Bloody Good
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,7,"I saw ""Underworld:Blood Wars"", starring Kate Beckinsale-Total Recall_2012, The Last Days of Disco; Theo James-The Divergent movies, Golden Boy_tv; Tobias Menzies-Game of Thrones_tv, Casino Royale_2006 and Lara Pulver-DaVinci's Demons_tv, Edge of Tomorrow.This is the fifth in the Underworld series-the forth starring Kate, she skipped out on one of them-and a sixth is in development, and it is starring Kate. The original one was in 2003 and Kate still looks good in her leather body suit as the Vampire Death Dealer. The war between vampires and werewolves is still going strong, with both sides after Kate. Theo is the only vamp she trusts to watch her back. The Lycans-aka werewolves-have a new and powerful leader, Tobias, who seems to be stronger than the rest of the pack-don't worry, it is explained where he gets his strength and it is connected to someone from a previous film, Michael, so you get to find out what happened to him because if I remember correctly, he wasn't in the last installment. Anyway, Tobias wants to get his hands on Kate or her daughter to use their blood to enhance his abilities. The counsel of vampires decides to forget all Kate's past indiscretions if she will come back and train new vampire recruits in the art of lycan death dealing, since she is so good at it. Lara plays a vampire that is on the counsel of vampires that has her own plans for Kate. The fights are good and the ending leaves things wide open for the sequel. If you are a fan of the series, then you should enjoy this one. I know I did. It's rated ""R"" for strong bloody violence and sexual content-no nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour & 31 minutes. I would buy it on DVD."
" Loved it!
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,9,"I had high hopes for this movie and had been waiting impatiently for it. And it was worth the wait. Got some surprises that had me going, ""Holy cow, never saw that coming."" I love that in a movie. I really appreciated the review in the beginning. That helped ground me again,even though I watched all of them again in preparation for this one. And probably will again. Kate did a great job as Selene and still kicks butt with the best of them. In Awakenings, I wasn't really into David's character. But in this movie, I think his role grew nicely. More depth and character development made me like him even more. And learning about his past got me more invested in him as well. They rounded his character off nicely, and I'm interested to see where they take it. What intrigues me is that they left a lot of room for future movies. I sure hope Kate signs on for more, because she's pretty much why I watch these."
" Not that bad, Not that good but average
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,5,"The fifth installment in finally here, Blood Wars!The movie was great in terms of action sequences but plot wise...not that good and a bit confusing. In the Underworld movies fighting the final boss or main villain is always entertaining but in this one....the battle between Selene and Marius was not that entertaining. I mean yes, she is now stronger than before and can move so fast that not even other vampires and werewolves can see her, but it felt as though Marius was defeated a bit too easily and it fails in comparison as to how Victor was defeated,William and Marcus. The ending wasn't that satisfying to me. Nevertheless it was a great movie and the fans will definitely like this one."
" Underworld Blood Wars Review
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,10,"Underworld Blood Wars is the best movie out of all the previous Underworld movies, it has new face, enemies and some original characters such as Selene and David from Awakening. This story tell us about how the war is going to be won but Selene doesn't want anything to do with it until her life is a stake, her and David team up again and make new allies through out the film. Like I said before this film is amazing, action fact and awesome. I believe that other reviews and mine should be looked at and looked through but shouldn't be judged on our reviews, its up to the viewer of the actual movie because everyone has different taste of movies such as horror, romance, etc. Lots of people and critics have different opinions on different movies such as suicide squad lots of people like it and others didn't. Once again I believe to the reader who reads this, give this a try, you might like these kinds of movies or even love it but don't listen to people who have said it's crap because its not their type of movie then and you might think oh since this review says its bad then don't listen go and try new things"
