" This was a comedy??
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,3,"One of the worst comedy films i've ever seen.These films end up frustrating me more than entertain me. So many of them have been made over the last few years. Some made well such as 'The Hangover' franchise, most miss the mark.It's the 'simple night out gone horribly wrong' sub genre to which i refer, the totally unbelievable series of events which conspire against our protagonists is so far fetched, people act incredibly stupid, react even more stupidly and it all ends up in some convoluted mess.Yes, sometimes we can have nights or days where things seem to snowball, but generally these things happen outwith our control. In most of these films events are entirely avoidable."
" Truly awful
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,1,"A bad movie, based on women being hysterical and only good for child care with a weird religious angle"
" Probably the dumbest movie ever!
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,1,What a shocking movie. No story line and not a single scene is funny. Absolutely ridiculous!
" This Christian move is a shambolic mess, but it has its good points.
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,10,"I am a huge Sarah Drew fan, aside from being attractive, she is a very good actress. I am also a huge fan of Christian films, even though i'm not a religious person.I read lot of mixed reviews, and everybody is entitled to their opinion.It could be said that this movie is a lot of fun which it is, where most Christian movies simply mention God an awful lot, and why not ?, Western Society has lost its way as far as Christianity is concerned.Christianity to me as a non religious person simply means having a good heart and caring about others.This came across well when one of the husbands of these woman on a night out, made a phone call to a friendly biker who was a Christian, to help find a seemingly lost baby, so this biker got his biker mates to take part in the search, when it was discovered the baby was being well looked after by a neighbour.The ending of this film is the best part with all the dancing at the bowling alley. I wanted to join them.I always give Christian films 10 stars because they are always meaningful, and they are right. Imagine Western Society adhering to the 10 Commandments ?, no chance, we honor the golden idle.I give this movie 10 stars because it was a lot of shambolic fun, and I may even watch it again to see if I missed anything."
" One of the worst movies I have ever seen
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,1,Terrible. Sterotyped uptight mothers without a life. Come on. Get over it. Terrible acting and plot.incredible stupid and a waste of time.
" Family Friendly.
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,10,"Perfect family friendly, clean movie. Comedy that depicts the feelings of motherhood and having an identity separate from just being mom."
" Don't do it
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,1,"Absolutely not what i expected when i put the movie on. Horrible from start to end. Do not recommend unless you're in to annoying, screaming, self-pitying, useless characters with no substance. Do yourselves a favour and use these 90 minutes on anything but this."
" The movie proves good comedy doesn't have to be vulgar.
",2020-09-15 00:00:00,10,"Good, clean, and funny... Very refreshing entertainment. Thought Trace Atkins (Bones) was especially good."
" Boring. Not Funny At All.
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,1,"They call this a comedy? Not funny. Very boring. Had to stop watching in middle of movie, could not take another minute of this trash."
" Very meh, not funny.
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,4,I am a Christian who dislikes PureFlix. This isn't the worst but its not good by any means.
" I loved this film!
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,9,"This movie took me by surprise. My wife rented it. Made me watch it. I faced it like a man facing a firing Squad. I was pleasantly surprised to find it both warm and heartfelt. If you are a parent I promise you will laugh that much harder. A simple family film with not a single moment of CGI combat. A wild card in a hand full of Duds. A simple way to say it, ""I loved this film!"""
" Not as great as I thought
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,4,"I had seen this movie years back and remembered I liked it. So now that it's free on IMDB I thought, ""why not?"" Also I really wanted to see Harry Shum Jr. Now that I have seen it years later from when it was released I realized that it was so boring. Nothing made me excited or on the edge of my seat. The acting was alright but didn't hold up with the bad story.
Overall it just wasn't good."
" Awesome, wholesome movie!
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,10,"I love cheesy, clean, wholesome family films, and this one's all that minus the cheesiness. Normally, when i watch a Christian or family film, the actors are not very well known and the acting's not that great. But here, you got Patricia Heaton, Sean Astin, big name actors and it's not a low-budget film at all! Even the less-popular actors i thought was amazing. As a Christian, I could say that I love this movie and it's such a quality film that i wish we had more of in the industry. Overall, two thumbs up! Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a clean, fun, wholesome family film that everyone can enjoy."
" Awesome movie!
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,10,Thank you for seeing us moms! It was so nice to be able to watch a movie and put my full support behind it! I love to laugh but so many comedies are so vulgar and condescending and not even that funny. This one I gut laughed so many times! This is one of my favorite movies. Would love for them to do more like this! Top notch actors/ actresses! Loved every minute of it.-Christian 30 year old mom that usually watches kickass action movies with husband.
" How is this movie so low rated?
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,9,"Up front, I am a person of faith, but wasn't when I saw it. And I have only laughed this hard in two other movies, What's Up Doc and Hot Fuzz. Absolutely funny, but also very thoughtful. I am a stay at home dad, so, perhaps not being a woman but one who had to raise our kids when they were small made me connect to it differently.Sarah Drew and Sean Astin have real chemistry, are very cute together and were fantastic. Patricia Heston shows she really was the best part of EL Raymond. The rest of the cast is a step below, but do an adequate job. But the one who may have stolen the show (but not the baby) is Trace Atkins. He was fantastic and you can tell Sarah Drew is fighting laughing at him in the police station he is so...dead-on. Regardless of your faith or position on stay-at-home moms (and again, I stay at home so my wife can be a superstar), or even if you are afraid of luchidores and children, you will have fun watching this. And then realise (if your a man) the way to your wife's heart can be found you cleaning the kitchen.Now go watch the momma eagle."
" This was delightful!
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,9,"Yep, all the way thro the credits. If you thought you had some bad days, realize that everyone has has one that's worse. Well done, believable, and makes me glad I never had 3 PRESCHOOLERS at the same time!
The Kendricks wrote another winner, reminiscent of the Keystone Kops at points, and reminds us also that everyone had a mom, and we all have stories worth telling and listening to. Even pastors' wives."
" Silly and fun
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,10,"Yes, it is silly. It is supposed to be. But people don't seem to mind unless it is faith based. I wonder why that is?"
" I should have went out
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,2,Very bad and I have no idea how and why I watched this till the end.
" A Dull, Mostly Unfunny Movie
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,4,"I could not bring myself to like this movie, the characters are annoyingly stupid, bland writing, the humor is forced and unfunny(I only found ONE scene funny). I'm the only person in my family who doesn't like this film. The critics don't like the film, well honestly I don't blame them, having Christian faith in movies is okay, but that doesn't automatically make a film good. Skip this movie and watch something better."
" This might actually be the worst movie I've ever seen.
",2019-09-29 00:00:00,1,What's with all the Christianity? Why do Sam play in it? What's the plot?
" Over the top!
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,3,"Now, I read the reviews before I watch some films. So I was forewarned about this movie. The thing is I didn't realize it would be this bad!! Over the top...irritating characters...particularly irritating kids' role. Seemed to be a combination of every ""night out"" movie done in a really bad way."
" Disappointing retrograde twaddle
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,3,"This film is riddled with sexism against both men and women, showing limited roles reminiscent of leave it to beaver; however it fails to be entertaining in the least.Also unsettling in a negative way is the fact that the film thinks tasering pepperspraying and police threatening to shoot people are humourous in and of themselves (given in the context they didn't have any laugh value at all).I kept waiting for something good to happen but even the ""big breakthrough moment"" is as trite as a hallmark card... Waste of time"
" I liked it. And I would watch it again.
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,10,Kids were funny. Parents were funny. Trace Atkins as a biker. Funny. The characters were well written. This movie is fun. They should make more like it. And for those who want trashy. Forget it. No trash. Yes your kids can watch this as well. Just make pop corn first.
" Funny and good for the family
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,10,"Finally! A clean and family film without the use of profanity and sex. It is really funny and great acting. My kids and I watched this and couldn't stop laughing. I wish there was a part 2 :) So many movies add so much sex and profanity and aren't needed. You can make a good clean movie and it can turn out great..Mom's night out is proof! The best part....""He killed mama!"""
" Wanted to like it.
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,4,"Started watching because I'm a fan of Patricia Heaton.
Unfortunately she was under used. I did like that the movie was clean, no cussing, sex or drinking. They would start doing a funny setup, but then didn't follow through. The characters were over the top at times. In regards to previous reviews saying this movie constantly mentions God & preaches at you, is totally false."
" One of the worst movies ever
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,1,"A cheap horrible knock off of similar movies with an All male cast, but the acting in this one is only surpassed in cringe by the completely worthless script. The people behind this movie, should never be allowed to make movies again.
A more suitable title would have been Neurotic Night Out.
After ten minutes I had to watch the rest of it, to see if it was really that horrible, and it was. I would rather watch every Adam Sandler movie, than watching this Piece of crap again. It really is the worst movie I've seen in years."
" I genuinely laughed at parts
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,6,"Mom's Night Out is actually a pretty cute movie. Maybe it's because I'm a parent, but I genuinely laughed at parts. I thought the acting was good, too, which is strange because usually movies like this are fairly cheesy. This movie is silly, but it's a fun family show that I would watch again."
" Just an entertaining movie and enjoyable movie.
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,8,Not a typical movie out of Hollywood. I wouldn't call this a christian movie but it was safe for all ages. My family was surprised as it was much better than we expected. Entertaining. Good cast of characters😎
" I DON'T THINK THEY CAN BOOK A BABY
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,10,"This is delightful comedy that centers around stressed out super-mom Allyson (Sarah Drew). She conspires with two other stressed out mom's to have a ""mom's night out"" and to let Sean (Sean Astin) mind the kids along with his single buddy friend Kevin (Kevin Downes). The other two members of the threesome include Sondra (Patricia Heaton), the preacher's wife and Izzy (Faith based film cutie Logan White).We discover that the ability to walk in heels is not like riding a bike. Both the women and the men are out of their element leading to an over-the-top comic adventure. While the situation approaches unrealistic, the one liners had me in stitches. The plot is cliche and formulaic, but works with the characters and on screen chemistry.The film has a faith based message and utilizes stars that have been strictly in faith based films. With the help of a few headliners to carry the film, plus a decent script that wasn't bogged down with a faith message, this film was delightful, even to this old atheist cynic.Trace Adkins played a philosophical biker who tells Allyson and us, after a night of hell, what she apparently needed to know to enjoy life.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
" Yes a little funny
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,6,"OK crazy reviews...but a funny movie sometimes, clean language mostly...has a couple stars in it but I gave it a six because it has a good story line, an overused story line."
" Nothing goes really wrong
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,4,The film is all ages because not much bad is happening. Mildly humourous. Very cute moms though. Cute kids. Very harmless. As if it was made for moms that worry a lot.
" Predictable and stupid
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,5,"Not to be confused with ""Bad Mom's Night Out"". A Sophomoric Canadian 90 minute sit-com. Only the first 10 minutes are worth your time. Cable fodder. Our heroine seems to have the perfect family life, but her kids are driving her bonkers. An hour into the ""film"" she and two other longtime friends go on a girl's night and find out that the dizzy hostess made the reservation for the wrong Saturday, so they end up at the bowling alley. Every cliche I can possibly think of: The ""clueless"" dads. A slightly ""wild"" minister's daughter. A parakeet flies out of a car window. A missing child baby-sitted by a neighbor. A tattooed biker. Police station capers. Hard to watch as it is so ADHD and jumpy in nature. It tries way too hard to be funny and is exhausting to watch. I couldn't get through it and had to skip to the ending. It's supposed-to-be a ""Christian"" movie, but I missed that. Not a bad comic car chase, however. I didn't really like it."
" A clean faith oriented family movie - a bit overdone but still fun.
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,7,"I'm an Australian. I liked this movie as a fun, clean movie for couples and families. However it is a bit overdone sometimes with generalisations about men, women and church. Too many over the top hysterical emotional explosions from women. Too many incompetant irresponsible men doing dopey stuff. But still it is trying to portrait a wholistic hopeful message that embraces family and faith. The characters grew through their struggles and this is always nice to see."
" Fun movie about three moms simply trying to enjoy a harmless night out on the town
",2018-03-19 00:00:00,7,"RELEASED 2011 and directed by The Erwin Brothers, ""Moms' Night Out"" is a dramedy about three mothers in Birmingham (Sarah Drew, Patricia Heaton & Andrea Logan White) who go out on the town while their husbands & a friend watch the kids (Sean Astin, Robert Amaya & Kevin Downes). Alex Kendrick plays the pastor and Sammi Hanratty the teen daughter. Trace Adkins appears as a tough biker while David Hunt is on hand as a helpful cabbie. Andrea Logan White plays a friend of the three moms while Harry Shum Jr. appears as her ex-beau. This is a family friendly dramedy with a little edge and slight faith-based elements (limited to one comical church scene and one exchange at the end). The ""inept dad"" theme is tiresome and unrealistic (it seemed to me like the children lacked discipline). But there are some gems to mine, like the female lead being overwhelmed by her own doing. In short, she set an absurd standard for herself and labored under her self-imposed expectations.The church bathroom scene is hilarious. Have you ever had a meltdown over something trivial due to pent-up frustration and were embarrassed to discover that someone saw/heard you? There's another laugh-out-loud sequence when someone is innocently doing something, which is inadvertently telegraphed to a bunch of others, but offering the wrong impression.BOTTOM LINE: This is a fun movie with several genuinely humorous moments and a lil' bit of mind/spirit food. THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hours 38 minutes and was shot in Birmingham, Alabama, and Pelham, which is just South. WRITERS: Jon Erwin and Andrea Nasfell. GRADE: B"
" Awful
",2018-01-29 00:00:00,3,This movie makes you feel like you're listening to an audio book. There's a horrible narration of the movie. We turned it off after 20 mins of a plot that was not going anywhere.
" Horrible
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,1,"From the infamous Christian movie makers. It was religious anvil after religious anvil. For a film that is proclaiming mom needs a night out. Every plot point is to the contrary. Sad thing is, there is some real talented actors. But their gifts are squandered. My advice would be to skip it."
" Not too bad
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,4,"OK, so when I put the movie in and saw all these trailers for faith based movies I said to myself.. oh no.. what did I do (as Im not a religious person) and the PG rating came up I almost turned it off. but I did end up watching this movie the whole way through and I can say its not bad. If you know someone who is religious.. they will like this movie. It has faith based overtones but wasn't in your face the whole movie. There was a particularly touching scene with Trace Adkins and The lead female that made me smile."
" Funny, clean, very much truth. some chiches
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,10,"Very funny movie, I love the way the story is told from a pre k mom's perspective. Very true how most stay at home moms feel and overwhelm. Really enjoyed watching with the family, clean enough to watch it with kids. Some parts were a little cliché like the car chasing but overall it was originally and funny enough. I think Marco's character stole the movie."
" Absolutely delicious and completely unconventional parent's movie
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,8,"YES, the last 2 minutes of the movie is a religious Christian message. But this is only the last two minutes in the movie AND the movie is neither Christian nor has Christian values so to speak. In fact, this movie will disturb both Christian people and no religious people - last ones because of the message at the very end. This is why all negative reviews give it 1/10 which is obviously only a reaction, not an evaluation.Aka The Hangover for parents. Yes this movie is not perfectly done like the Hangover, but it has such realistic and sarcastic touches, it is a pleasure for open minded parents and young couples.This movie was down voted by a Hollywood politically correct fan people. Like chasing a minivan full with kids or putting the teaser on Pastor's 'perfect' wife is not going to please plastic people. No, it's neither that caricaturist, gross or irreverent type of comedy movie . It is just an honest unconventional type of movie that we would all watch if the Hollywood wouldn't exist.Oh and the acting is sparkling and well mastered: very fresh."
