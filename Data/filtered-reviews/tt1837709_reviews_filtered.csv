" One of the most romantic and magical movies!
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,10,"Watch this movie, you won't regret it. It is one of the most romantic and heartfelt movies I have seen to date. It reminds me of stardust. The cast are brilliant and the acting is superb. The storyline is so wonderful and magical. The visuals are very eye catching and ethereal. The music is really fantastic and it's by Hans Zimmer who has created some of the most iconic and unique movie soundtracks. Don't listen to the negative reviews. It's a really heart warming movie. This movie should be seen."

" Brilliant acting Colin Farrell
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,8,"I've put off watching, as I'm not a fan of early 20th century period films. But IH HOW GLAD I gave this film a try, Colin Farrell's acting was so unexpected, not the rough action man, moving and helps make this film one of the most emotional, yet gripping film . As someone myself very ill I wasn't upset more uplifted by the magic in the story line.
Romance, history, fantasy and sad reality all in one film. A must."
" Tear jerker
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,9,"I loved it.
Some of my favourite actors in it and mixed with the fantasy makes it my perfect type of film. I've never read the book but will now, I'll also watch it again which is unheard of for me. I watched it with no preconceptions which I think it's why I just took it at face value. I cried quite a lot too, poor husband just rolled his eyes at me lol"
" Confused Genre - Which one it is???
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,5,"Looking at the plot, I thought this is going to be a good Rom-fantasy, but the movie is completely into something else. I can't say its romantic (I liked the small romantic part though), but yes, it is fantasy as I can clearly see animatic character actions here and there plus daemon presence etc in the movie. I have no idea about the book version of story, if this is how it goes in the book, probably I may never read it. Cinematography is really good throughout. Logic is missing in places, I know you can't expect it in fantasy, but Russell character wanted Peter to be killed with knife in very start of the movie, but when he had a clear chance in later part of the movie, he just pushed him into a river without even a drop of blood injury made and expecting him to be dead!!!??? And the climax fight?? what was that? Probably I can picturize a better daemon fight if I am reading the book I think.Its more of starting with some romantic, claiming fantasy throughout, a bit of religious, but goes with some common messages about Universe, Light, Daemon, Human, Life etc etc.. God knows what... So overall if you are looking for a good Romantic movie with fantasy touch, NO, STOP, this is not the one."
" Too much lore
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,4,This movie suffers from present too many concepts to the viewer and not explaining any of it. This movie has demons in New York trying to stop miracles from happening and corrupting people. Then there are angels too apparently but are they are not supposed to intervene. However one angel helps the demon kill the main character's lover for some reason. Will Smith is Lucifer and dictates the rules the demons must follow for some reason. There is a flying horse too. I'm sorry but I kept asking what? Why? through this mess of a movie. Performances were fine and I can see that the story was trying to do but it just doesn't work with the lore dragging it down.
" Amazing tale, I rewatch it every year!
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,10,"In a world of sadness, suspicion and disbelief this film is a jewel of hope! I am not a fan of love stories, but this one is so different. It is not limited to the description of a couple's story. It is about true love that is beyond time, beyond evil, above all. Besides, there is no point in trying to be accurate and close to reality, when it is just a winters tale! Just watch it!"
" Just fine
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,8,The storyline of this movie is a bit boring and also their acting is so melodramatical.
" Let it stroke your faith.
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,2,"There seems to be some confusion why so many hate this film. Let me guess...It has no real plot. They are in love the moment they see each other and everything just falls into place through no effort or sacrifice. There is no growth to any of the characters.Secondly: Don't make a movie about how unique and special each of our individual lives and destinies are when some people get sent divine intervention to have their cancer healed, and millions do not.There is no real explanation why Peter didn't die. I said REAL. if love makes you immortal his girlfriend would not have died.What is the point of having the demons point out in this magical love story that ""we're losing"". It's almost as if this is dramatic religious recruitment propaganda pretending to be romance.
If you disagree, all you have to do is think of ONE reason that conversation was relevant to the story.
If it wasn't for such pointless additives I would have given this a higher score. It would have been better if they cut out all the demon bits. it would have been better if the narrator had the fortitude to speak from the confines of the movie; instead she ""what if"" the same way religious fanatics argue in real life, as if she doesn't know whether magic is real - in a world with flying magical horses, miracle healing and demons.
Let me say it plainly. In that world, you become stars. You WILL be embraced forever by those you love the most."
" Love and Destiny
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,7,"I have not read the book, and I am sure I would have loved it 10 times more than the movie so no comparison with the book here. I loved the movie, it was emotional and gives hope to love and find our destiny. Russel Crowe was brilliant. You can watch it on a Sunday lazy afternoon with your love, friends or Family."
" Waste of cast. Misfires at every point. Snoozefest.
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,4,"This movie tries to be like the notebook (even though I thought the notebook was overrated, I thoroughly enjoyed it) and The Great Gatsby with a fantasy edge but fails miserably. I dont know if I should be proud that I sat through the entire thing or ashamed. Even after an hour and fifteen minutes into the nearly 2 hour runtime, I did not feel invested into the plot nor engaged or intrigued by any of the characters except Will Smith's lucifer. There is no point in me going into any of the fantasy elements or deep insight because the film doesn't bother to do so. That being said, by the time it got to the execution of the actual main point of the film I didn't care. I just wanted the movie to end. Ignore all the 9s and 10s, this movie doesn't deserve anything over a very generous 6."
" 'A Fairy tale of New York""
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,6,"Colin Farrell (""Peter"") does bring a limited degree of magic to this tale of a young burglar who tries to rob an Upper West Side brownstone. Once inside, he discovers that ""Beverly"" (Jessica Brown Findlay) is already in the house and that's where this love story begins. As the plot develops, we discover that our hero has the gift of immortality - and a wonderful winged horse - and a lethal enemy in a rather oddly cast mob-boss Russell Crowe as ""Pearly Soames"". The story is a rather meandering affair, with no clear direction - at times a romance, at times a fantasy violence mystery. The cast don't really gel, and the romance itself is just a bit too soporific to keep it interesting. The visual effects - the horse, snowy New York and all that, do contribute well, but ultimately it's just a thin story that falls between adventure flick and fairy tale stools."
" Nice fairytale...
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,5,"""Winter's Tale"" is a Mystery - Fantasy movie in which we watch a man who is a burglar understanding his purpose to save a young woman but fails and she dies in his arms. After that he understands that he has the gift of reincarnation and he starts again his race of saving her.I liked this movie because it is simple, without many unnecessary information that would made it boring and because of the good story line. I also liked the interpretations of both Colin Farrell who played as Peter Lake and Russell Crowe who played as Pearly Soames but I believe that choosing Will Smith to play as Judge was bad. Finally, if you want to watch a nice fairytale movie then you should definitely watch this movie, do not have high expectation from it because it's just a fairytale and I am sure that you won't be disappointed by it."
" It's hard to think of words to describe beauty like this
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,9,"I remember I came across the film Stardust about 5 years after it as released and it instant;y became one of my favourite films. All of us love a fairy tale and this one was one of the best.
I've just today come across Winter's Tale which is now 6 years old and I can't imagine how it passed me by. It reminds me of Stardust even though the film is totally different.
I wept at parts, I laughed out loud at parts, and I was filled with wonder at 'what could be' at others.
A beautiful fantastic story."
" Not as bad as people are making to be
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,7,I found myself actually pretty entertained with this movie don't get me wrong this movie isn't perfect it has its flaws like cgi anit that great and I thought the third act was very rushed and some acting wasn't great but I did like colin farrell performance and I thought the love story was interesting and I did like russell crowe as the villain I still recommend watching this movie
" Don't know who's more foolish; The horse who won't listen to his master or the master who listens to his horse.
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,7,"The film can be a bit disjoined at times for viewers and hard to follow. I enjoyed seeing Eva Marie Saint in the film. The cast included Russell Crowe, Colin Farrell and Jennifer Connolly as well. The production values were high quality and the settings varied from time to time. I couldn't follow it at times. If I had the time to pay attention to detail, I would have probably enjoyed the film more. I thought it was a version of William Shakespeare's play, ""A Winter's Tale,"" which is what I thought it was about. I'm surprised that this film didn't get the attention it deserved."
" One leaves the novel reluctantly. One leaves the film with great relief that it is over.
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,3,"""Winter's Tale"" tells the story of a thief, a consumptive heiress, and a sentient magical white horse, but, really, it is the story of New York City in Helprin's imagination, a place like the one in reality but with some strange alterations. The Hudson freezes solid for miles, and people set up tent cities along the ice. There is a frozen magical town up-river where time takes on strange qualities. There is a whirling mysterious white cloud-wall that surrounds the island of Manhattan, a cloud-wall that everyone accepts to such a degree that no one notices it anymore. What is the cloud-wall? What does it signify? The wall is gone in Goldsman's version. In the book, it is the whole point-the reason for everything. Goldsman has missed the point of the book entirely.One leaves the novel reluctantly. One leaves the film with great relief that it is over."
" Wrong description
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,9,"I liked the ad tory but i would have created it little differently. And the movie description here is wrong or i didnt pay enough attention while watching it - the guy cant reincarnate people. He just had 1 mission to do, to *SPOILERS* save the red hair girl, to revive here and make her live a long life. I didnt see there reincarnation, i was expecting for it and i was dissapointed not to see it. Reincarnation would have been more interesting. I thought maybe that little red girl was the same girl the dude loved long time ago, like she got reincarnated into this young girl in 2014, but thats not true i suppose. Ive never read the book so.."
" Awful
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,4,"A Winters Tale (2014)Plot In A Paragraph: On the run from a mob boss (Russell Crowe) a down on his luck orphan (Colin Farrell) falls in love with an heiress with an incurable disease.This is awful!! Everyone phones it in here. The story doesn't make much sense, and I'm amazed it was ever green lit!!Looking at that plot In a paragraph there is some potential for a lovely romantic movie. What we get is a total misconception of a movie. We get good vs evil, supernatural dealings and Russell Crowe (sporting an Irish accent) slashing the throat of waiters when they do not have what he wants.A Winters Tale became Will Smiths lowest grossing movie since 1993 (21 years) as it grossed only $12 million dollars at the domestic box office, it became the first Will Smith movie since Where The Day Takes you in 1991, to not be amongst the highest 100 grossing movies of the year."
" A Decent Attempt at Fantasy Drama
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,7,"27 December 2014. It might be better to describe this movie as a fantasy drama rather than a romance drama. There are strong implications of fantasy in this movie that border on the occult or horror genre. Russell Crowe has a rather particularly nasty, violence role. There is romance, there is good vs. evil and there is an element of time and generations. Yet for all the effort, there seems to be a lack of a compelling relational connection throughout the entire breadth of the movie. The movie begins with a seemingly fairy tale voice over and yet descends into a more much darker movie. Unlike Constantine (2005), the evil isn't as interestingly attractively diverting. The Hans Zimmer's soundtrack isn't really that pronounced or an interesting park of the movie, missing the best sound as used for the ending credits. While the directorial attention on period romance offers up some qualitative, cerebral interest, the rapture of entertainment value of say Time After Time (1979) or Kate and Leopold (2001) is lost. A much more interesting sci fi drama for comparison take might be The Signal (2014), Cloud Atlas (2012), or Interstellar (2014). Perhaps the most magical part of this movie is how beautifully young Jennifer Connelly continues to be."
" A Critical Mass reached!
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,7,"I recently wrote how disappointed I was with the critically acclaimed movie remake of Widows, in particular the number of narrative threads in the film that ended up going no where. Conversely with Winter's Tale, I find myself liking a film many of the professional critics claim has an incomprehensible story line.I have to disagree. I found the story relatively easy to follow after the prologue, (which did admittedly feature multiple cross-cuts in time) had passed. Collectively, the critics appear to have missed the point, reinforced by the film's narrator at the outset, that the story is a fantasy. It makes no attempt to disguise the fact that this is not a reality-based story. Real life stories don't usually involve miracles, equine guardian angels, demons, one hundred and twenty year old people who don't age and a liberal dose of the eternal battle between good and evil. This is a little odd that they seem to have adopted this collective mindset, as the book, the film is based on is clearly a fantasy too. In adapting a close to 700 page novel to the screen, as frequently occurs, major changes are made to the storyline, as occurs here. In his film directing debut, regular A-List Hollywood script writer Akiva Goldsman has sensibly chosen to centrally focus his adaption on a love story that has the power to cross the chasms of time, with accompanying ramifications, positive and negative, for both human and supernatural life..By no means is this a flawless film. It's good to hear Colin Farrell for once using his (presumably) normal Irish accent. But one has to question why, in a story, where he is raised from a post-natal age in New York? Perhaps it has something to do with why Russell Crowe's demon character Pearly Soames is also using an Irish accent. But the relationship is never made clear, nor really the reason why Soames is so doggedly determined to have his revenge on Farrell's Peter Lake, for simply leaving his band of scoundrels, bar a throw away line about no one is allowed to leave.Crowe however is in fine fiendish form as Lucifer's right-hand man in central New York. An edgily-chilled Will Smith is worth seeing in his two scenes as the timeless leader of the Dark Forces on Earth. William Hurt, Jennifer Connolly and Eva Marie Saint all turn up in valuable supporting roles. But the film succeeds on the persuasive efforts of its two leads playing literally star-crossed lovers; Colin Farrell and Jessica Brown Findlay. Never having been a real Farrell fan in the past, I have to say he was born to play this part and Brown Findlay, is simply a revelation as Beverly, though admittedly probably way too beautiful for a girl stricken fatally with consumption. In discussing casting I cannot finish, without mentioning the delightful Andalusian stallion Listo, that plays ""The Horse"", Peter's name for his Pegasus-like guardian angel. He gallops away with every scene he features in.The special effects are adequate in a film where Goldsman obviously doesn't want the effects themselves to become a dominating influence to the detriment of the main story thread. The recreation of late 19th century/early 20th century winter-bound New York is very convincing.For me personally this is the most absorbing onscreen fantasy romance since that of Aragorn and Arwen in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Time Traveller's Wives etc. notwithstanding. Open-minded romanticists should not be put off by narrow-minded critics. Enjoy!"
" Best fairlytale
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,10,"Don't read the reviews. Great movie, great actors. Loved it!"
" Total mess
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,5,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Winter's Tale"" (2014) is a perfect example that even biggest stars in a world can't save a movie if its story is written this bad as with this movie. I think that every story can be done good no matter how convoluted it might sound of paper - you only need good writing, and this movie unfortunately does not have one. The story is a total mess which even great actors couldn't save.Overall, ""Winter's Tale"" is a boring an uninvolving movie. It has great actor doing there best in a very poorly written story. This movie is a big mess."
" this is more like a fairy tale than a movie
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,8,"Frozen has more action than this. all the action in this movie is flying around on a horse. that does not mean tis is a bad movie like some people say. its just not a regular fantasy movie. its more like a story narrated through words using a picture book. 
it depends on feel factor. but couldnot generate enough feel. its not boring either time line shifts pretty quickly in this movie. will smith plays lucifer. so there is that. i did not know so i was surprised.
this movie is good enough if you r in a mood for a fairy tale. it has a very good picturisation for a story telling."
" Winter's Tail End.
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,4,"Like the season, Winter's Tale proves to feel longer than one would prefer. This film would've been great, if it wasn't so nonsensical. Keeping it exactly as it was, perhaps Winter's Tale would've gone down better as an animation.Yes, it's a fantasy film, and yes, suspending disbelief is among the top rules to follow, especially with today's modern methodology of movie making, but, though too many things made little to no sense in this film, what the actual tragedy is, most of them did so unnecessarily, and that can diminish the enjoyment factor quite significantly.Also, Beverly and Peter's connection was thin. Whether it's because of Colin and Jessica's chemistry,Goldman's directing or a combination of both, the 2 leads' connection throttles the love component, a component which is in fact, the entire basis of this film. Love can be portrayed in one sentence, so the immediate love arc isn't the problem, the directing and the story was.I understand why some may love this movie, however I have to believe that, to love this movie you either 1). Saw, and chose/managed to ignore all the many things wrong with it or 2). You were unable to see its copious short-comings.Truthfully, the best thing I can say about Winter's Tale is that, it had great potential, but got lost in what it thought, was great. Hell (Get it), even Will Smith's performance was pretty awful, and William's, well, it almost hurt, to watch. 4.5/10.P.S. Was anybody else reminded of Tangled while watching this film?"
" The best romantic film ever!
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,10,"If you are willing to watch a movie that will get so emotional and makes you happy and sad, and be a part of it as you're living it then this is the best option for anyone who wants that!"
" Colin's Hair
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,8,I think Colin's hair deserve some sort of acting award! I haven't seen hair getting flipped so much since Farah Fawcett!!
" Just a great fairy tale that hits all the marks!
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,8,"Rarely in this day and time do I see a movie that makes me tear up with joy or tear up at all. ""Winters Tale"" is what could be good about all movies. Your imagination is given a tour for all time. Every scene is done very well. Not to give to much away but hope is never so important and used delicately in the world this film lives in. Preteens viewing this with their parents could really enjoy this as well. Casting was done very well I thought. The ending leaves you smiling and my feelings were rewarded to say the least. This Film is a strong 8 and I rarely leave a comment so strong as this one. I hope you can enjoy it as much as we did. My wife and I rarely agree on a movie.. But this one did it for both of us."
" It is not a film version of the book!
",2018-04-03 00:00:00,7,"And I think it is grossly misleading for anyone to approach it with that expectation. Scorsese apparently thought the book was unfilmable (but I once thought that about LotR) and it would certainly require a mini-series to do it justice.
So what the director has done is take the essence of the love story and made it into a film. There were also some differences between the book and film that I don't think detract from either. Accept that premise and I think one can enjoy it in its own right. 
Nevertheless, I was disappointed that we got so little of Beverly and Peter actually together that a lot of the sheer joy and beauty of the relationship in the book was lost. That may explain why people who haven't read the book weren't so invested in the characters, while those that had felt a bit disappointed.
For all that, I enjoyed the film and will keep it in my collection."
" Very wonderful and thought provoking
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,10,"I've used IMDB religiously for years but have never written a review till now. I love this movie so much and when I saw that it's average score was only 6.2 I only hope my score can improve the average! This movie really makes one think that the universe and all of us is much bigger than just ourselves, and that all of our actions good and bad have a ripple effect. It's also a very touching love story and you really feel for the main characters in this film. Anyone who has not seen it take a chance you will love this movie."
" Kind of a misstep
",2018-02-02 00:00:00,5,"I love fantasy, unlike my family. But to mix it in with an every day life scenario, it has to be done right. In the case of Pan's Labyrinth, the beautiful combination of the real war-torn world and the fantasy world worked spot on throughout the whole film.In this movie, the gaps of the fantasy world aren't really filled out properly. It presents itself as a world where demons and angels are fighting some kind of war. But the rules aren't very clear. This is made evident by the fact that the book is incredibly long and covers too much ground for it to be made in a film (Martin Scorsese himself deemed it unfilmable) The other, albeit much milder, problem I have with the movie is Will Smith as Lucifer. Now don't get me wrong, I LOVE Will Smith, but this just doesn't work. To play the devil, an actor has to have two things: Irresistible charm and the ability to terrify the wits out of you. Smith definitely has the first, but not so much the second. It unfortunately ends up being too sickly sweet and clichèd for my liking."

" Even the stars have names
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,7,The film incorporates ancient beliefs about life. We are all connected by light. We turn into stars when we die. There is one miracle in all of us.The gods/angels/demons intervene.In our tale Peter (Colin Farrell) is a thief in NYC. He leaves the dark side run by a demon Pearly (Russell Crowe) and joins the good side. Pearly works for Lucifer (Will Smith) and is after Peter who meanwhile falls in love with a pretty redhead (Jessica Brown Findlay) who is about to die from TB. Peter literally lifts her off her feet and rides off on a magical white horse. This leaves me really skeptical: Did a guy really write this? This is a slow developing story. It has several good scenes and a number of snooze scenes. I would leave out the narration which assumes the audience are idiots and work whatever ideas it gives us into the Lucifer dialog.This is a soft PG-13.
" An unique atmosphere
",2017-09-08 00:00:00,8,"Found as a kid in a small boat, raised and trained by a very influential man, Peter spends his time robbing safes and evading the authorities. That is, until one day he meets a beautiful but dying young woman for whom he falls.It's a fantastic movie in which people strongly believe in destiny, that each person has one and he/she cannot die unless it is fulfilled. After death, people become stars and live together with their loved ones in the universe. It's dramatic and sad in its core but impresses through it's fantastic world which slowly unveils. It's a captivating atmosphere which keeps you interested throughout its entirety, but it has many moments of boredom. Also, the story is good and pretty coherent, but isn't very satisfying, a little more work regarding it could have made a lot better. Still, it's a good movie overall."
" Moving tale and adaptation of a great read.
",2017-08-25 00:00:00,8,"This film moved me in such a way that I was inspired to read the novel. I would recommend both the film and the novel. However, like most Novel-to-movie adaptations there are significant differences, but the overall delivery of the film is spot on. As I wrote earlier, this film moved me and made a deep impression upon me. Highly whimsical and enjoyable. Good/evil and Love and Light. Enjoy. Highly recommended."
" Nice Try
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,6,"I wanted to love this movie. Really, really wanted to. Winter's Tale is my favourite novel; but, I didn't want that to get in my way - I went in with an open mind. I knew that lots would have to be cut out (or else the movie would be 27 hours long!), and focusing on Peter Lake and Beverly Penn was obviously the right decision. BUT, then why would Akiva Goldsman ADD something? The totally ridiculous Judge/Devil character, played by Will Smith, is an invention that was very poorly chosen - it destroyed the magic. Parts of it were good: Colin Farrell is brilliant as Peter, Russell Crowe is a fiendishly wonderful Pearly Soames, and William Hurt is perfect as Isaac Penn; yet parts were bad. Although she is a great actor, Jessica Brown Findlay is woefully miscast as Beverly. Do yourself a favour, skip the movie, and instead go and read all of Mark Helprin's novels."
