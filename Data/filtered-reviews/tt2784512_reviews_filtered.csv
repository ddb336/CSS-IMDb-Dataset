" B-movie fun
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,5,A film which doesn't take itself too serious and is fun to watch if you go into it with the same mindset.
" better than starwars
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,10,"Best film i've seen in a while. Spooky, funny, and made cry."
" A funny horror comedy!
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,9,It's a good movie after a tough day to relax and have some fun.
" Not to be taken seriously!
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,7,"This film does not take itself seriously and neither should you.I don't know how people could give it low scores when it is what it is, and doesn't try to be anything else.There were definitely strong 'Critter' vibes for me, with some lines from Die Hard and Aliens thrown in for good measure.Watch this in the right mood with the right people and you'll have a fun time."
" If the title didn't tell you enough,,,
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,6,"It's cheesy horror at it's best!! Hilarious time!3 coeds travel to one of their cousins cabins for the weekend. Lil do they know that the local beavers have been exposed to a chemical
that has turned them into ZOMBIES!!!!!!!!!"
" show stopping
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,10,"The way that the beavers are infected really depicts how nature is treated in today's society. it really has such a deep underlying meaning and shows us a possible future ahead of us.the film is spectacular and gives me chills everytime i hear the name ""beaver"". i was so spooked however am so glad i don't live in america coz in england we don't have beavers so we might not get zombeavers but zombadgers instead. crazy innit lol.anyways i enjoyed this movie. it really brought the ability to feel again. emotions such as fear, joy, arousal and excitement flooded through my body. i loved the character zoe and enjoyed how she got absolutely flattened at the end lol. the dog also getting scrubbed was quite heart wrenching however i did laugh."
" Do you see that deer up there?
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,7,"I have no idea why this has such a low score. As far as I'm concerned, if a film achieves what it sets out to do, and entertains in the process, it has to be worth a 6 at least. This sets itself out very clearly to be a cheesy, campy, ridiculous comedy horror. All tick boxes checked comprehensively. I laughed out loud at various points from beginning to end (literally the opening scene to the after credits scene).
This is not high art, nor does it claim to be. It is fun, funny and thoroughly enjoyable. Considering this is a classic B-movie style film, it is surprisingly (for the required intention) well filmed, scripted and acted. If you want bonkers and fun comedy horror, then you have come to the right place!"
" Starring no one you know!
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,6,So bad it's good...Beavers that turn into zombie's & stupid college students that didn't leave when they had the chance! Chaos ensues..
" Damn rubbish.
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,3,"Didn't have high expectations to start with, but was expecting an amusing tale and comedic deaths, I got neither.If you're a 13 year old boy then it might produce the odd chuckle, for everyone else the humour is going to fall completely flat.The deaths are, 'meh', at best and you know there's not enough material here to pad out a movie if in an hour and ten time run the first 5 minutes are the opening credits, so don't expect much plot or character development at all.This could have had a lot of potential if done correctly and parodied it's genre more closely. The only thing they really got right were the Beaver puppets.Skip this and watch Black Sheep instead, far superior zombie animal comedy flick."
" Next to it, Sharknado is a masterpiece !
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,2,So bad in every aspects that this WTF movie is becoming hilarious. And don't miss the post-generic scene (Zombees is coming).
" +/-
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,6,"+: does quite a bit with a ludicrous premise, good dark humor
-: Ludicrous premise, several death scenes not over-the-top enough given the execution of the premise , characters could be a little more developed"
" Absolute scenes.
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,10,"Favourite film I've watched all year. Saved 2020. Incredibly realistic, fantastic acting, I couldn't ask for anything more!!"
" Fear the Beaver!
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,7,"A trio of scantily clad sorority sisters and their jackass boyfriends are terrorized by zombie beavers; who actually looked pretty creepy before they ingested the toxic waste to be fair.If the title alone didn't give it away the film is not exactly high brow cinema but it's entertaining, has a sharp script and is generally good mindless fun."
" Funny and enjoyable cheesy creature feature
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,9,"Trying to get over a bad break-up, a woman joins her girlfriends' for a girls-only weekend getaway at a lake-side cabin in the wilderness, but when their boyfriends show up for a fun time they all find themselves attacked by mutated zombie-like beavers mutated by a chemical spill and must try to get away from the lake alive.This was a highly enjoyable and rather fun genre effort. One of the better features here is the cheesy build-up that manages to get everything started in a goofy manner. The dropping of the toxic waste into the lake and how it arrives at the site is quite silly, while the enjoyable build-up of their arrival at the site and having fun with each other before they get interrupted by the arrival of the men who then take over the weekend. Once the group realizes that the creatures are out there and attacking them, there's a fine addition of some cheese-filled sequences here including the realization that the beavers' bite can turn the victim into a humanoid hybrid creature that has some goofy humor attached to it. Combined with the appropriately silly puppets for the creatures and some goofy one-liners that are quite funny, the cheesiness of this one is quite enjoyable. As well, there's so much to like here with the creatures getting to put some great attack plans into use. From the first attack on the couple in the bathroom where they realize the creatures are in the area to the gang getting attacked out at the lake where the group is ambushed in the water by the creatures and have to get back to land and inside the house, this has a lot to like here. The fact that the final half turns into a spectacular series of siege-style attacks featuring the creatures trying to break into the house via any opening or hole they can find forcing the group to defend themselves generates a lot of exciting action, while the dueling finale featuring big action scenes trying to get away from both the creatures and their new victims who are turned into creatures themselves. There's a lot of fun with the race to get out and the effects work featuring the human-like beaver-creatures, and with the fun gore here this holds up quite well. There are a few problems to be had with this one. The main issue here is the wholly unlikeable group of characters the guys turn out to be, who are completely idiotic and don't have any business being with the girls. They're fun idea of dropping in uninvited on a girls-only camping trip when one of them cheated on his girlfriend several days before serves as completely moronic, much like their continued insistence on silly and ill-thought-out plans to get out but only serve to get them into greater danger with the creatures. That gets fixed somewhat as it goes along but is still somewhat of an issue here when it starts, while the other issue throughout here tends to be a slightly obvious and intentional issue with the puppets of the zombeavers. They're quite obvious about what they're doing and how they plan to accomplish this but it still needs to be mentioned how cheesy-looking this is. These are nowhere near as detrimental as the other issues but still hold it down.Rated Unrated/R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Nudity and a comedic sex scene."
" Actually better than what you might think
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,5,"I know, a movie about zombie beavers with pretty college girls so it can't be good. But it really is better than you might think. The acting is I think purposely over the top and it fits perfectly for a movie about zombie beavers. Production value is quite good and the beavers are for the most part unrealistic but it's just fun."
" The best worst movie you'll ever see! Watch it!
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,10,"Cinematic garbage at its absolute most hilarious finest!! If you love horrible, cheesy, ridiculous, low budget horror comedies you'll love this. This movie is absolute GOLD."
" This is the definition of NONSENSE!
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,1,"Absolute Garbage, horrible plot, please don't even recommend this movie to your enemy..."
" Moronic comedy horror
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,4,"A typically moronic comedy horror flick, ZOMBEAVERS is squarely aimed at the beer-and-pizza crowd looking for laughs, gore, and flesh. The pinnacle of this genre is PIRANHA 3D, a film I adore, but ZOMBEAVERS is far from the quality of that production. It's saddled with simplistic scripting, annoyingly vapid characters (Rex Linn's hunter excluded), primitive puppet effects, and a generally generic tone. Early on the story seems inspired by 'The Raft' segment of CREEPSHOW 2, although the latter moves to a cabin for EVIL DEAD-inspired scares. Topless actresses and really poor gore effects are the order of the day here, but it's all entirely perfunctory and not very amusing."
" Cheesy But super funny
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,10,I gotta admit it is a super cheesy low budget movie but it's super funny I could not stop laughing so if you love low budget and cheesy moives I would recommend checking it out
" LITERALLY THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,10,I HAVE NEVER LAUGHED MORE THAN THIS.. EVEN SHARKNADO COMES SECOND TO THIS... 10/10 EXPESIALLY LIKE THE PART WHERE HE KICKS THE BEVER
" Zombeavers is an experience...
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,2,"Some parts of it are so bad they are good and others are just bad. I thought it was funny that these teens were so focussed on sex, but then they long out the joke too much by showing so many scenes of them doing it. Some of the jokes work and some fall flat and when they do it makes things uncomfortable. The puppets make things really funny as they are so over the top. I recommend that this is watched with a group of friends, preferably drunk."
" Misunderstood
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,8,"The low ratings here are due to the fact that people think the director wants us to take this movie seriously when it's simply a parody of the B-Rated horror movies of the past: Hot girls in bikinis and short-shorts, horny guys, awful special effects and a bad script. It's so well done we should applaud and not criticise!"
" Strikes the perfect balance between horror, comedy, nudity and beavers.
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,6,"Mary, Zoe and Jennifer head to a cabin in the woods to escape for the weekend, little do they know that an accidental spill of radioactive waste has effected a dam full of beavers and their holiday into a terror filled nightmare.This low budget comedy horror creates the right balance of nudity, horror, silliness and beavers to work really well. We're not talking Oscar worthy material here, but it's light hearted fun and will entertain and amuse."
" Hahahahahahha it's exactly what I expected
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,4,"Ok, right. I went into this film expecting some amusing b movie. And that's exactly what it was. The acting was sub par, the ""get out of the water"" line was acted so so so poorly. And I loved it.
I did like the imagination of the director, when the beavers were outside the house there was obvious light bulbs for the eyes. This was a personal favourite.I mean it's a bad film, there's no doubt. If I am to take this review seriously for a minute. I thought the plot was fine until the final half an hour, it just became weird after that. The ""zombeavers"" not only were zombies, but also gained this ability to be dead smart. The protagonist from the off, died. What was the point? Also they all died so again, what was the point in the film?But yeah, just go into this fully expecting a b movie and you'll find it amusing!"
" I knew it was going be bad but not that bad
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,1,"That's 100% one of the worst films I've ever seen. The acting was physically hard to watch, I'm being dead serious when I say I think I could've done a better job, it's like they weren't trying. I normally Don't Mind bad films I actually enjoy them but this was too bad. Also everyone dies so what's the point, get out my face with that man."
" 'Flithly hairy beavers'
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,5,"The movie could win the award for worst effects, worst characters and worst dialogue. You might wonder then why give it five stars!? Some times you just got to credit too really bad movies. It had me laughing out loud at points and kept me entertained for its realtivly short run time of just over an hour. Plently of jokes and dry hummor. To be honest if this movie tried to be good it would of fallen short but it then end we get some fun so who can complain."
" Not as bad as it sounds
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,6,Surprisingly more amusing than one would assume from the title. Reasonably well acted. Camp special effects. Doesn't take itself seriously.. What more could you ask for.A solid 6 for this one.
" So much fun
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,8,"Monster B movies are my guilty pleasure and this didn't disappoint. Basic special effects, clunky puppet beavers, clichéd characters and groan-worthy beaver jokes - I laughed, I gasped, this was time well spent. If you're going to watch this, please don't attempt to take it seriously!"
" A silly but fun waste of an hour and a half.
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,6,"A toxic waste truck drops a barrel that causes a dam of beavers to turn into zombies. Yes the premise is silly, harking back to the fun B movies of the past. Most of the characters are ok, with a couple of exceptions in the form of two incredibly annoying characters you end up wishing would die. The effects are silly too in the form of puppet zombeavers instead of the awful, cheap CGI you would normally see. All in all its a fun waste of an hour and a half."
" 😟
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,4,Mini spoiler alert!Why?! Just why would they feel the need to show the doggy being eaten by beavers?
" Zombeavers was damned of any originality despite its gnawingly bovine title.
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,2,"Zombie beavers. No, not slang for the female genitalia (although the film predictably makes a joke or two regarding that), but the large semi-aquatic rodent that yearns to build wooded dams during the innocence of night. Showered in toxic chemicals from an accidental spilling, these beavers suddenly become, well, not mutated by the hazardous particulates, but instead zombies. Manically gnawing their way through telephone wires to cease communicative abilities, wooded floorings of cabins and even limbs. Suffice to say, ""zombeavers"" are pesky rodents indeed. So when six unlikeable teenagers, comprising of three couples whom ""bang"" out their hardships (if you catch my driftwood...) stay at a lakeside cabin for the weekend, bloodshed is bound to occur from those nibbling critters.Rubin's horror comedy, despite the obvious hairy nature of its title, is absent of ingenious originality, merely imitating several ""mutated"" creature features that preceded this viral film. 'Eight Legged Freaks', 'Black Sheep' and, rather reservedly, 'Birdemic: Shock and Terror'. Admittedly that last entry is an abomination that makes zombie beavers idyllic pets, yet it justifiably illustrates the commonality of such (un)natural horror films. Zombeavers seemingly focusses more on the sexual lust of its despicably unappealing characters than the zombified hand puppets themselves, continuously arguing over loss of phone signal instead of meeting their grisly demise. The Kaplans' script believes itself to be an intellectually self-aware parody, but ultimately comes across as conceited. Primarily opting for moans and screams of orgasms instead of horror. ""Yeeting"" beavers out of the porch window and shouting ""they're rabid"" doesn't exactly exude humour. Neither does throwing an adorable dog in the lake, offering it as a sacrifice to the beavers to provide distraction. Not cool.The grade of practical effects were, to say the least, expected. Complacent hand puppets that emanate growls resembling the sound of Mr. Krabs' laugh from 'Spongebob Squarepants'. Y'know the one. ""Ah-gah-gah-gah!"". Sure, they're supposed to be funny, but an ounce of menace could've gone a long way in this snooze-fest. The acting was mediocre. Character deaths were uninspired, aside from the biting of a certain ding-a-ling. The introductory credit sequence was obnoxiously ostentatious. And the credit theme song tried to imitate 'The Blob'! How dare they! Oh, and in typically zombie-fashion, what happens when one zombie scratches or bites another creature? You guessed it. Zombie human-beaver hybrid. Incisors, possessed eyes and tail included. Heck, one of the girls was ""dropping like it's hot"" against a door to continuously bang the floor with her tail. Work those thighs, gurl! She got beavered!Ahem. So, yeah. Zombeavers. Is it the new 'Sharknado'? Hopefully not. But atleast Rubin opted for practical effects over shoddy SyFy visuals. Shame that the originality of its title is the only element that boasts an inch of individualism. Everything else? Just not funny."
" It's good
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,9,"I guess there isn't much I need to say about this. With the title, you really do know what you are getting into. zombie beavers. lolI will say this, the production values are much better than I expected. Actually they are very good.The cinematography is very good. Even the zombie beavers look good.That brings me to the humor. Actually, there really isn't any. The story plays it straight. Everything is serious and not silly at all. But, this actually makes it hilarious whenever you see the beavers, or they attack. Every beaver attack I couldn't help but burst out laughing. Seeing little zombie beavers attacking people, or flying through the air. It is so funny. :D And then later, some human zombies had beaver teeth, and even a bear with beaver teeth. Pretty funny stuff :DIt's nice too that they used practical effects for the beavers. I don't think it would have worked with only CGI. I'm sure they probably used some CGI, but if so it wasn't noticeable to me.The characters were okay. They seemed pretty realistic types. Not really realistic for sorority girls, as some of the members were. But, that is a staple of the genre, sorority girls in horror. Anyways, the just mentioned sorority girls are smokin hot, and sometimes nude. 8OSo anyways, check this out if you're into horror creature features. You definitely wont be disappointed."
" It is better than others horror comedies
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,7,It is not a masterpiece but is fun. Three beautiful girls fighting for their lives...
" Where's the sequel
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,10,This is hands down one of the greatest movies out there. I'm currently working on adding this movie into my up coming DnD campaigns. We need part two so we can get to the full levels of beaver fever.
" What? Really? It works
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,7,Decent horror film that drops in a lot of references to random things and classic horror movies.
" Trash
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,6,"Funny, nice trash.
I had to laugh a lot.Don't take this movie too serious. It's good comedy."
" Cool looking zombie beavers & great gore FX
",2019-06-29 00:00:00,8,"I notice a lot of disrespect, and ridicule about this movie (It is to be expected, it is a movie about undead beavers!?) I think 'Zombeavers' is a surprisingly cool movie the same way the first 'Lake Placid' was unexpectedly very cool to me the first time I saw it. I also really like the look of the zombie beavers. Unique movie. Recommended for fans of the weird, gory, and fun!"
" Love it!
",2019-06-29 00:00:00,7,"This film is terrible and knows it, you get what you expect, a great b-movie, with wonderfully bad acting, and a bonkers plot. Gave me a fair share of giggles watching this, if you haven't seen it, watch honestly just to experience this. I want more b-movies just like this."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,6,"Ummm. this movie does exactly what it sets out to do, and does it well. had some good laughs. And it didn't just feel like some crappy movie they made as a stunt, it was actually well-made in a lot of ways. And during the parts I wasn't laughing, I was still smiling and amused (2 viewings)"
" Make no mistake the movie is as silly as its title, and I absolutely love it
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,10,"If you expect something else than a silly and fun B-movie with all the tropes of the genre than this movie is not for you.I have always loved horror movies, but the sad fact is that most horror movies today is either paranormal stuff (which i don't enjoy) or bad attempts of finding the charm and horror of early slasher films. Between these categories are the B-movies that for a couple of decades completely killed the horror genre with their low budgets, bad action, terrible stories, and gore fest approach to making movies. While often more bad than good most B-movies have something that most new films lack, charm. No matter how silly and bad it might be these types of movies tend to drag me back because they good simple fun. I consider Zombeavers to be a proper homage to the cult genre and while nothing new and consisting entirely of the clichés of the genre it is well made and good fun.Holistically the movie does not deserve 10 stars since it is not meant to have good acting, story and cinematography. But 10 stars is how much I enjoyed watching it, and in the end that's all that matters."
" The Future Before Your Eyes
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,10,"With human disrespect for the planet, this will be part of the future soon. Has the ZOMBEE movie been made as to the ending of this movie?"
" Despite it's many efforts, really bad and not funny at all
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,3,"Another wannabe horror/comedy that fails horribly in both categories. Really bad and boring, almost no gore and tries very hard to be funny but there actually aren't any jokes or anything funny happening at all during this 90min disaster. Love B-horror movies bigtime, I love offensive or dark or stupid humor, this didn't feel like a low budget offensive or funny horror at all and it really sucked. A real crapfest take my word for it."
" Fun horror
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,8,"I watched this movie based primarily on the title. It was actually fun. The violence and gore were fun and over the top.
The premise amusing.
It is well worth the watch."
" So crazy, but still good
",2019-01-16 00:00:00,8,"This movie was hillarious on his own way. The plot is simple just like other zombie movies but original. In world where we have just normal zombie movies it's great to see something different, but still similar. I really enjoyed this movie and I am sure that I watch it again. It's not a masterpiece but in horror comedies which I lately see it's fresh wind."
" No CK or getting AA's
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,5,"Well it's not Citizen Kane, and it's not going to win any academy awards. I just wanted to say that. That's the way you start a review for a cheesy horror movie. Correct?
That's what I thought I would do. Once again I shall reiterate. It's not Citizen Kane, and it's not going to win any academy awards. Got it?For those who enjoy films like Critters to Piranha 3D, there is something to enjoy in this wacky, cliche filled guilty pleasure of a movie.For those expecting Citizen Kane or an academy award winning film, Look elsewhere. This is not that."
" FAT RATS WITH BIG TAILS
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,6,"Three babes head out to a cabin in the woods where they encounter Beavers turned into zombies due to a toxic waste spill. Add some personal problems, no phone service, and guys and you got the picture...exactly what you would expect looking at the DVD cover. And yes they all wear bikinis.The film had some good scenes. I liked how they tied together the opening and closing scenes. The girl conversation dialogue was good, but went off a cliff went the guys showed up as did the film. The beavers were more fake looking than an Oscar Erickson postcard (obscure reference). Campy by design. The ending outtakes were better than much of the film.Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Cortney Palm- ""Sushi Girl"")Note: Toxic waste is generally not transported in an open bed truck and it rarely looks like radiator fluid."
" So many zombies, so many beavers.
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,8,"I thought this was a great movie. It had everything you want in a movie. Zombies, beavers, shooting, stabbing, biting, a puppy. Even my wife had a laugh at this movie, and her sense of humour is dryer than a nuns hooha. Anyway, if you like stupid comedies, this is definitely for you. And if you're like my wife who thinks the joke, ""why did the butcher die? Because he cut the wrong sausage."" is funny, you might also like like this movie."
" Exactly what you would expect
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,9,This movie is everything a spoof movie should be. The title 'ZOMBEAVERS' should give away the nature of the movie. Perfectly put together with 80's style sound effects/music. The classic intro style and music was what drew me in. Had a commical storyline which kept it going. Only point taken off a perfect score was for casting. Half the cast was spot on though. Good movie. Would recommend this movie to spoof lovers or just anyone who wants to watch a simple movie with a storyline.
" 10/10
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,10,Storyline amazing. Special effects amazing. Character development amazing. This film goes off
" Cult classic material
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,7,"It doesn't take itself too seriously and that's the point. Plenty of fun and laughs to be had while watching ridiculous zombeavers chase around scantily clad young men and women exploring their sexuality while on vacation and suddenly having their body parts ripped to shreds by the gnarly zombeaver teeth. Acting is both awful and occasionally good, plot is completely ridiculous and it even sets itself up for a potential sequel at the very end of the credit roll - Zombees! Lol. It's all worth watching for a couple of good laughs and 60 minutes of beaver bemusement. Come for the beaver puppets, stay for the zombeaver attempting to eat the ummm.. beaver!"
" I could not a ""Goof""...
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,4,Around 43 minutes three of the characters are leaving to go to the hospital and they leave the front door open even though there are hungry zombie beavers outside.
" Hilarious
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,9,"Go in and have a good laugh with this one. John Mayer has an amazing cameo that starts the movie off just right, and it keeps it up from there. This is a near perfect movie for what it is. I'll always recommend it to anyone who likes B movies like me."
" Not the worse thing I've ever seen
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,10,10 stars because it really is better than the 4.8 stars it has right now. It's actually a much better film than it's low budget looks would belie. Shut your brain off and just enjoy it for the so bad it's good B movie it is. I would definitely enjoy the sequel hinted at after the credits and Courtney Palm is definitely an actress I would like to see more from.
" It's so bad it's good
",2018-06-10 00:00:00,2,"Good to watch if u need a laugh, watched it a few years ago with my friends, I wouldn't watch it again but I'm glad I watched it.
It was the lowest rated horror film of 2014 which I think is unfair, so I give it a 10/10 to boost the ratings"
" Want serious, this isn't it, and that's kind of the point
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,7,"When this first came out I wasn't sure it would be any good. Honestly, from the trailer, I figured it could go either way. My mind screamed it's a trap, you're going to get sucked into watching this and it's going to be garbage. When you've been burned a bunch of times on films like this that mechanism in your brain has a tendency of kicking in. A time preservation tool if you will. Despite that internal warning I went ahead and watched it anyway. I was pleasantly surprised and I ended up buying it. It has become a cheesy-fun favorite.This film manages to get just about everything right in the enjoyable fun sense. While it's far from perfect and has some truly stupid moments it's a blast. The FXs range from really creepy and well done to cheesy as hell. That kind of rolls with the film itself though. The premise is so uniquely absurd it almost seems fitting that it's a bit unbalanced. You've got all the right tropes for characters, plenty of gore, a little bit of random nudity, and a ton of immature crude laughs. Some of which have dulled on me a bit from repeated viewings, but that's to be expected. This is a horror fan's horror-comedy. Certain films I feel are geared towards a specific audience and this is one of those films. While non-horror fans might enjoy, I don't think many of them would get what the film's going for. At least that's the way I perceive this film. If you're a horror fan, this is one to check out. Don't expect it to be serious, and while maybe not quite as good as films like Cooties, The Final Girls & Tucker N Dale VS Evil, this will probably be right up your alley. My Rating: 7/10"
" It's a low brow comedy horror horror and it couldn't been made better.
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,"This is a movie that has no delusions about what it is. It's a dumb little piece of horror comedy but within those parameters it's made so intelligently.Maybe that's going a bit far but it's heaps of gorey fun that makes you lower your guard so that it does get some scares in amidst some breast and at least a couple of twists I never saw coming.It has a sweet setting and the characters were fleshed out enough though I was quite glad to see at least one of them get beavered.Also, the choice to use animatronic beavers, not CGI, sets this apart from the money other nickel a dozen creature features out there.It's a competent pastiche of both the zombie genre and the zombie parody genre."
" For real? Raunchy fun.
",2018-02-05 00:00:00,8,"You mean on purpose? Dumb, a bit stupid, so bad it is funny...crazy, but true...on purpose. A dialogue so hammy, gratuitous nudity and crazed beavers for your viewing pleasure. A gang of college students are off to the lake for some fun and getting nasty. Somehow the rowdy gang gets the attention of some un-dead murderous beavers and take cover in their rundown cabin. These co-eds will have to get their stuff together in order to survive. Director Jordan Rubin wants you to laugh...and you will!The cast features: Rachel Melvin, Lexi Atkins, Jake Weary, Peter Gilroy, Hutch Dano, Phyliss Katz and Rex Linn. ZOMBEAVERS is rated R and worth every bit of it!"
" Boring
",2017-12-16 00:00:00,3,"This movie is one hour and seventeen minutes, yet it feels like an eternity. The only parts of the movie that aren't mind numbingly boring are the scenes where the beavers actually attack. The name Zombeavers is a bit misleading too. The beavers got transformed by toxic waste, they aren't dead. And how could it make their bites transform humans into beavers? This is proof that Bill Burr will do anything."
" Really fun to watch
",2017-11-22 00:00:00,7,"Zombeavers is a typical B-movie slasher with gorgeous looking girls, immature boyfriends and killer beavers. It will appeal to everyone that enjoy comedy/horror genre, although this film does not offer any real horror but it does manage to be funny and entertaining. The story, of course, is absolutely ridiculous but Zombeavers never pretends to be anything more than it is. The writing is actually quite witty, the opening scene with Bill Burr will definitely make you laugh and the acting is just right for this type of a film. I believe that it deserves a higher rating and I would recommended it to anyone that is into this type of films with knowing exactly what to expect and have a few laughs along the way."
" Not as bad as the title would make you think
",2017-11-09 00:00:00,6,"I admit that I have a love for B horror movies. While there are countless piles upon piles of horrible ones, there are some decent and half way decent ones. This falls into the decent category. As you can guess from the title , this movie is about mutant, zombie beavers and the humans who have their weekend of drugs and debauchery interrupted by them. The acting in this, while not Oscar winning stuff, is above average for a B movie, and the gore effects are decent enough. The biggest problems I had with this movie, was it over preachy ecological message. But check this out. Despite what you think, you'll probably enjoy it."
" Actually quite funny
",2017-10-19 00:00:00,6,"I hate what has happened to the zombie sub genre, film makers coming up with ever more stupid names for their movies, a trend kicked off by Shaun of the Dead. So I did not have high expectations for this stupidly named Zombeavers. Thankfully I was pleasantly surprised. It's actually a silly but fun film. Lots of gore, gags & boobs, plus it's relatively short. Watch it with a few beers"
" Not as bad as I expected.
",2017-05-22 00:00:00,3,"Truth be told, I watch these awful SyFy original movies simply for the joy of watching how terribly put together they are. This one however had me a bit more intrigued than many of the other one's I have seen. While the plot is still fairly basic (College girls get together to show off their boobs and butts and have sex with the most dimwitted idiots they can find) out on a lake. The beavers are actually fairly well designed. If I didn't constantly see that I am in fact watching a SyFy original, I might have actually said this was a good movie. Well not really, but in this case that's okay, like I said, the entertainment is partially in how bad the movie truly is. The ending will leave your jaw dropping and also make you laugh your behinds off. Not a bad watch if you have nothing better to do."
" Frankly, My Dear, I Kinda Gave a Dam
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,5,"""Nice beaver!"" – Lt. Frank Drebin. ""Thanks. I just had it stuffed."" – Jane Spencer.That famous (or maybe, just to me) Naked Gun joke is my contribution to a lake of more ""beaver"" references in Zombeavers.There's not much to report to a film called ""Zombeavers"" other than: if you like When Animals Attack films like I do, you might like this. If you like zombie movies, well, eh, I guess? And if you like horror- comedies, this worked for about half the jokes. (That half actually made me laugh out loud – mainly the two truck drivers, but sadly the other fifty percent was either unfunny, overkill or missed the markand many opportunities.)Someone I know compared this to a Syfy Channel movie, like that godawful Sharknado. I disagree. While the premise: ""Return of the Living Dead meets The Evil Dead having Cabin Fever inside The Cabin in the Woods near The Raft"" sounds suspect, it's moderately above that trashy schlock/CGI the Syfy channel spits out in seconds.Granted, the budget didn't seem that high and some of the Zombeaver- attacks seemed either intentionally funny or not, but at least the cast was taking it dead-serious. That part, and the 50% humor that really worked, I admired. Going by the title alone, you know what you're getting yourself into. It's not the best horror-comedy, in fact, it ranks pretty low in that subgenre, but you could do a bunch worse. Like said (ALL) Syfy Channel movies. ***Final thoughts: Stay through the credits for two Marvel-esque post film/credit scenes. They're both worth it. Well, if you made it that far in the film, anyways."
" Brutally funny comedy spoof
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,7,"I can't believe some of the reviews of this movie - people have actually taken 'Zombeavers' seriously? A film about zombie beavers and people are saying it is 'stupid'. Unbelievable. This is actually one of the funniest comedy spoof films I've seen in a long time.You should always judge a comedy on how much it makes you laugh, and 'Zombeavers' is a brutally funny film. The actors know how ridiculous the material is and exploit every opportunity in the script to make us laugh. There is a surprisingly large audience for these type of films and it's just unfortunate that people lacking a sense of humour have hated on it.This is a film I will definitely remember and revisit some time in the future and one I would recommend to anybody with a similar sense of humour to me. I thought it was hilarious."
