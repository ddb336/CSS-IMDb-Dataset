" Poor patrick, Lou she is a gold digger
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,2,"Very bad message to show to the audience, if the man in chair was poor, Lou will stay always loyal to her BF patrick, patrick didn't do any thing that wrong to be dumbed."
" When Love Isn't Enough : A Review of Me Before You
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,8,"The most heartbreaking movie of our time, Me Before You takes you to the saddest moments of your life. The film is set in the beautiful, quaint, and verdant town of Pembroke, United Kingdom. In this movie we follow Louisa ""Lou"" Clarke (played by Emelia Clarke), and William Traynor (played by Sam Claflin) on a journey of self discovery, love, and gut wrenching heartbreak. William, once a lively and very active man,was left a quadrapalegic after a terrible accident. Louisa, dealing with personal traumas of her own, takes a job as his caretaker; little do they both know they would become so much more to each other than either of them imagined.
The film's narrative touches on many tough areas, some of which spread throughout current and public social issues/debates, including the moral ambiguity of assisted suicide, a choice made by Will in the beginning of the film. The film also explores one's capacity for empathy and growth, and shows us that it is more important and impacting to fall in love with people's personalities and actions versus their physical abilities or attributes. The journey the audience takes with this charming couple as the film proceeds encourages laughter, wonderment, tears, and forces us to face and question ourselves when it comes to the heart of the film; ""what would you do for the ones you love?""
We follow Louisa on her journey to employment, after losing her job at a cafe, while encountering obstacles including her engaging but quirky choice in style, as well as her at times infuriating choice in romantic relationships, such as her boyfriend in the beginning of the film, Patrick (played by Matthew Lewis)who cares more about running and triathlons then his own girlfriend, leading to her introduction to Will Traynor, the handsome, witty, and at times cruel minded young man Louisa is employed to accompany as an in home nurse. While it quickly becomes apparent that Will's parents had a different idea of the role Louisa would fulfill for Will, Will and Louisa still manage to engage each other in ways that force them each to open themselves up to exploring both each other and the darker parts of themselves.
The audience begins to fall in love with the couple in much the same manner as they are falling in love with each other. Will Louisa's love be enough to change Will's mind? The audience may be thrown into a tear engaging heartbroken moment right along with Louisa. Being forced to explore this avenue makes us question within ourselves; whether we would be willing to do the same for someone we loved, someone who had already deemed themselves too far removed from this world and someone whom we would selfishly wish to stay even knowing there may be something better for them. Would I be able to watch a loved one go, and by their own choice/accord? And why is this option only available within certain countries while following certain parameters? Is love enough to save a life or is there more to life than that? The questions posed within this film and it's heart wrenching conclusion are ones that stay with us long after the film ends."
" True True Masterpiece
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,10,What? I've watched this film 5 times but the emotions with the characters stay true. This film truly should get 10/10.
" Loved It
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,9,I loved everything about this movie. I have not read the book and will certainly be doing so after I watch it again. Tugged at my heart strings and I absolutely felt the chemistry between Lou and Will. This movie reminded me that connection in a romantic relationship is the foundation. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because the ending got me all teary!
" The most brutal conflict
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,10,"A person who loves the feeling of living, who adores the lightnings and birds, has to die. I did not feel any more pain in any other movie"
" Touching.
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,9,"If you enjoy a film that makes you think and has a lot to say about the human condition, this is a good one. Thoughtful, emotional and enjoyable. Arguably, there's a moral dilemma thrown in, and no two people are likely to agree on the rights or wrongs of it."
" No recommended compare of the real book
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,2,"This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is so poor, you can't feel the connection between the characters. The book is a hundred times more beautiful than the movie, and there is no comparison. I recommend reading the novel and I do not recommend watching the movie. Worst movie ever."
" A basic story with a twist to romanticize suicide
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,1,"For some reason it is every teen girl's fantasy to make a dying boy fall in love with her. We've seen it in many movies. Plot is very basic, they don't like each other in the first act, all of a sudden something happens they're in love. End Of second act she feels like everything is lost. You could literally guess the whole movie from the first 5 minutes of watching.The worst part at the end is romanticizing suicide. People live a full happy life on a wheel chair but the writer thought it would be impossible and we must make the main character kill himself but hey! Let's do it in a romantic way.This is horrible movie but at least you get to see pretty and good looking actors talking in a British accent."
" Shame end
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,7,"This os the kind of movie that I would rate with a 10 if the end would be story of overcome the disability factor. The decision of love , kisses , companion and tiny moments of happyness would be enough to fight for more moments of living . This alternate end would be a must and its a shame that Euthanasia as also been approved now in my country during this pandemic. With death toll and lack of sucess in fighting a cure for Corona vírus , To BE medical assisted in death has become more easy to BE safeguarded by medicine science. To give up os always more easy than fight for happyness."
" Most Unintentionally Hilarious Scene
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,5,"There's a point in this movie where the paralyzed man is dancing with the female lead and Ed Sheeran sings ""When your legs don't work like they used to before"". I lost it in the theater"
" A total mess
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,2,"This is the most annoying romantic movie i have ever seen, justifying cheating and betraying a seven year old relationship for a ""Good cause"" normalizing terrible act like this without even the character showing guilt about what she's done or even becoming clear with her partner or at least breaking up!
They didn't even take time to tell the story about the progress of the relationship between them.
Loo was acting a lot out of character to movie with being so understanding for main character and so not understanding for her boyfriend. They chose to make her boyfriend lame so it seems like normal decision, but we actually see her having no remorse after her last fight with her boyfriend.
The last scene where she was reading this letter was nonsensical.
Plus the sound track they used many mainstream songs because they probably wanna attract teenagers where everyone knows them.
To sum it up...
The way all movie is portrayed to make everything sound normal is just sick."
" Very bad movie
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,3,"It is one of the worst films I have seen in my life
Emilia Clarke is a very bad actress ..... She is not good at acting and she was Disgust me"
" Really good movie 🎥 I Love 💕💕 it
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,7,I love this movie it's story heart touching love stories but it's ft film ending time cried emotional
" Emilia Clarke
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,8,"A very beautiful romantic movie
Emilia Clarke was of indescribable beauty
It was always the best"
" A wonderful romance
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,10,"I don't usually watch romantic movies, but it was great.I really enjoyed it and the story was great.The storyline followed very well and the film was perfect.Emilia Clarke and Sam really shone and they did a great job."
" Beautiful Movie!
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,8,Great performances and lovely story. I like the way Lou chats with Will. I was keep on smiling with tears while watching.Go watch it. Recommend
" If you love romance drama then this is the movie definitely a must watch film
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,10,"Usually I don't write reviews but ...oh! This movie...it's amazing
It's a feel good romantic movie with a great ending.
Defines love and a must watch movie
Don't hesitate if you don't like a tear jerking movie cause it's not that emotional rather it's make you feel good and happy."
" ABSOLUTELY ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,"YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS. If you're into romance just as much as I am, then this would definitely be a priority to watch this movie before you die. Maybe an overstatement but I am SO glad that I watched this. It's one of those good girl tried to save the ""broken"" guy type of plots but this one by far, has to be one of the most well directed and heartwarming movies out there in the movie industry. Titanic is my favorite movie and this definitely comes a close second. Not many romance movies make me tear up but this one had me sobbing into my blankets. Overall, just watch the darn movie. It's amazing for all the right reasons."
" Will you stay?
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,9,"I wasn't expecting the usual American love story, but still was pleasantly surprised there were not cliché moments. It's was so naturally. That movie - is a great combination of all factors: talented cast, outstanding places, nontrivial story plot, exquisite dialogues. I do love every single of it. But the most of all I love the fact that I still cant stop thinking about this movie. Over and over again I'm coming back to that beautiful and sad story. Trying to explain for myself character's steps, thinking about life and its weird plan. And as for me, such ""aftertaste"" - is the best feedback people can give.
Don't want to go deeply into story line. Overall, you no need to be a genius to predict the ending. ""Me Before You"" doesn't try to create a new genre. We've all seen some version of this movie before, but that doesn't make it any less effective. This story about life with its bright and dark sides. About heartbreaking decisions. About support and love. No matter what.
""Will you stay?"" - Will says to Louisa at the end. Will she? You better watch it, really. And expect to laugh and cry at the same time during the movie. Now if you'll excuse me, I have something in my eye."
" The best romantic movie!
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,9,"For me, ""Me Before You"" is one of the romantic movie that everyone should go to see. It shows the beautiful side of love and everyone will be into the characters. It has everything not only the romantic side but also the comedy part. The main story is about the cuteness Heroine that comes into the slient Hero life. She can make his life full of happiness and smile. I would like to invite everyone to watch this movie and you will know that love is always beautiful."
" Please don't take this personally
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,2,"Coming from the perspective of a disabled person, I hated it. I feel like it's easy for a random Ableist person to watch it and decide that if they were disabled in the way William is that they wouldn't want to live, either, or that their life wouldn't be worth living. But William's life is one worth living and the ending just really disappointed me when he decided it wasn't. I know that that's not how most of the people here interpreted the movie but it just didn't sit well with me. It's not necessarily a Bad Movie, I just personally did not like it."
" Ignore every bad review
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,10,"There is nothing negative you can say about this movie. If you need a good tear or a reason to hold your loved ones tight, this is it. The acting and the story line show no fault whatsoever. I absolutely cannot recommend this movie enough."
" Hollywood always glorify cheating
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"I don't care what the situation is. If you aren't casually dating and have been in a relationship for 7 years with someone, you cannot have a courtship period with someone else. In that case, break first and then explore your connection. Infidelity is NEVER attractive. No matter how and how much you paint it colorfully"
" Interesting
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,7,I enjoyed this. It was entertaining and overall I wasn't bored while watching it.
" 'Me Before You' challenges my past movie experiences and wins over all my preconceptions
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,9,"1. Movies based on successful books have disappointed me before 'Me Before You'. A book is a powerful media. Readers' imagination goes way beyond a tiny rectangle. Because the volume can hold how much ever the author wants, the story flows without leap of logic and with so many details. Along the movie adaptation, it has to be compressed and extracted, so as the story develops, there is something missing or sudden change in the movie. However, this movie chooses a few important events and focuses on them. Then, the director connect those events smoothly. I respect her decision to leave big chunk of Louisa's past behind, so the movie can really concentrate on love story between the two and Will's decision for euthanasia. The director exploits what the movie can do. Visualization. Louisa's quirkiness through costumes, all the settings with lights that romance up the audience, actors' facial expression, tone, and gesture. The scene where Louisa hops on Will's lap and they dance together is just beautiful, and symbolizes that they can love as much as they do regardless of what others think.2. Personally, the romance movie is too much to handle. I hate cliche and cringeworthy moments. Some others will call them amorous and sentimental moments, and of course, romance movie should have some kisses, break-ups, and au revoir to make the audience really 'feel'. I do not criticize them at all, it's just me who is not moved at all. However, 'Me Before You' works on me. At the end of this movie, I cried my balls out. Will's decision to let go is heartaching, and Louisa staying beside him even though she does not support the decision is true love."
" Better than the book!
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,10,"The screenwriters made this a 10/10. I read the book and the characters were not compelling or in depth. However, in the movie there is so much more emotion and you're captivated. The small changes made into the movie made it all the better."
" Good Movie but a bit Offensive
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,8,"Heartwarming/breaking movie, and both actors were incredible.
BUT, there is a lot of points were people actually suffering from these specific diseases might seriously feel offended, I suggest you to watch this."
" Tear Jerker
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,8,"First off, I adore Emilia Clarke. She just an adorable actress. Funny, sweet, lovable character. This movie touches on lots of topics. Loving someone for who they are. And sadly the choices we make for ourselves that not everyone will agree on. This was hard for me at the end but was good to see not to always expect things in movies to get better. I think falling in love with the characters made the ending a little more heart breaking for me. Glad it was another movie that didn't push sex, drugs and cussing in your face. Just a great movie with great people playing hard roles!! They were very believable!!"
" It's not Great but not bad
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,7,"When the film started i felt excited but in the meddle it's been bored because There is no biography for the story
.
.I have to pay tribute to the costume designer, he showed us Emilia Clarke in the most brilliant way."
" A feel good movie
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,10,This movie is definitely fits into the phrase some emotions dont need to be said but just felt.
" It's subjective but this is an amazing movie
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,10,"I don't care, this movie is awesome. This is the romantic movie category and it's like the first movie of this kind that I saw and I felt all the moments of this one. Love it, favorite romantic movie, indeed."
" Wonderful.
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,10,A beautiful love story with a emotional ending. You will feel your heart ripped out for such a terrific love story yet not fulfilled by God.
" Absolutely stunning piece of art
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,9,"While giving a thorough look in the daily struggles of a quadriplegic person's life, it displays that a person is capable of finding true love with anyone if their hearts are open to it.
This movie is the perfect display of all the experiences a person can relate to while falling in love and knowing that you will not be able to love anyone with so much passion ever again, because you know it deep inside that the person you love now is the one for you.
The ending shows that you do not require a souvenir of your loved one to remember them but you have just have to live on to tell the world that the feeling of them loving you is enough for you live and carry on the legacy of your love story.
Hats off to the whole team"
" Good romantic sentiment movie...!!
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,7,"A rich handicaped guy love his young maid..really the way of screenplay is good..
Climax 20 minutes is soo good..."
" Best romantic comedy I've seen
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,10,"It's magical and heartbreaking. Made me laugh, smile and sob like a baby - packs such an emotional punch, you'll definitely need tissues.
Honestly can't fault it. Loved the location and scenery, acting, directing, and I think it follows the storyline of the novel very well. Would 100% recommend."
" i cried
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,10,I cried when will confessed to Louis and they broke into tears! how sad it is when you know its inevitable... the fate!
" It is amazing i cant stop crying.it shouldn't end like this maybe because we always love happy ending!
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,10,It is from the best movies that i watched it. It is so close to our heart and it is amazing
" What a waste
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,3,What a waste of time! Last half hour completely ruined the movie. Garbage story! Such a disappointment.
" Questions Morals -no spoilers
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,5,Let me just say that htis film will leave you very disappointed and question your life values won't be worthwile watching and a total waste of time because it tells the audience its ok to give up if you have a reason. nooooooooo!!!1
" Gives the wrong message that people with disabilities should die
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,5,"Although beautiful, people say that even though his life paralyzed was fulfilling, yet he himself felt his life couldn't go on like this & prefers to die, but this is the WRONG MESSAGE just because he felt that way, doesn't mean he should die there are many peopple worse off than him, yet they fight the urge and enver give up. him PREFERRING TO DIE sends message to people with disabilities that they should give up and die too. This is the WRONG message and he gave up and stopped fighting which is the PROBLEM witht he story"
" Imensely Romantic
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,10,I love this movie. This is the most romantic movie of all times.
" Heart touching
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,10,I have never seen anything more romantic than me before you. It's a great movie about love
" Read the book.
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,5,"The book is 10 times better. So much was missed from the film or just missed out all together.
If you're going to do a movie from a book, stick to the full story. This was so wishy washy.
Disapointed."
" Absolutely amazing love story
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,10,Emilia Clarke's performance is brilliant and the chemistry on set is one of a kind. I came in expecting not much but after watching it I am amazed how romantic and beautiful this movie is.
" Cuteness of Emilia Clarke is unmatched.
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,10,It's a must watch could be the best romantic movie I have ever watched.
" Exquisite. Rated 9 just because... You will see in the movie
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,9,Like so beautifully presented. Sweet as dessert. I am so so glad that I watched it. Emilia is so good in her character. Sam's eyes are so stealing. Must Watch
" Add this to my list of movies that.....
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,8,"If I said anymore in my subject, it would contain spoilers. So here it comes....Another movie that has what I call unfulfilled love. For whatever reason (in this case, a man who decides to (with medical assistance and legally) end his own life), love that doesn't make it to the finish line. (Think Brief Encounter, Remains of the Day, The Fault in Our Stars) I see where some people think it is a terrible message to romanticize assisted suicide be cause this man's life just wasn't what he thought it should be. Did they see the same movie?? It is clearly stated that he is in pain all the time, and his health is so frail that he gets pneumonia quite frequently. He had plenty to live for with the exception of his declining health, so he was suffering and would only get worse. That said, this is a sweet movie that allows the stars to shine in the way they express the precious thing called time and how to use it, even finitely. Not the best movie ever made, but a true tear-jerker. That he thought to provide for her and her dreams after his death was a nice surprise - showing that love comes in all forms and can keep making memories no matter what."
" sweet, soft and romantic!
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,9,"Lovely storyline, very natural acting. Loved the plot and realistic scenes.
Only didnt like the ending, wish it was happy.
But after a long time, I watched a nice movie."
" My favourite film ever!
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,10,"Truly beautiful film, amazingly wrote from start to finish. It's the only film that has ever kept my full attention. I've watched this many many times and I would never get bored of it. 10/10 isn't enough for this film. Highly recommend"
" What a disappointing experience
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,2,"Will sounds like a common man, not a bit like Charles Dances son would sound. Lou sounds like she's straight out of a ladies finishing school.
The acting Particularly hers is by turns wooden and despite the overacting they could at times be reading straight from the script.
Whilst it is very faithful to the book as far as the action Is concerned the portrayal of Will & Jo leaves much to be desired"
" I loved it and hated it
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,8,"Me Before You tells the story of Lou Clark and Will Traynor. Lou has just gotten laid off from her job in a local coffee shop and is looking for a new job. She finds one as a caretaker for a disabled man, Will, at a local castle. Will has next to no movement or feeling from roughly the chest down after an accident that affected his spinal column and is rude, cynical and dismissive. Slowly Clark's slightly crazy nature and view on life melts Will's cynical heart and after a trip they are well and truly in love. I will stop my description of the plot here for fear of spoiling how it all ends, but I understand why it went the way it did and I wish I didn't and it didn't. It touches on something I have personal experience with and I believe that is why it affected me as it did. Even so I figure people can puzzle out what happens (it's not THAT surprising) by me saying that, but at least I'm not saying anything outright. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie, both Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin play their parts both convincingly and beautifully and the story feels very much believable. As with any good romantic film you will need tissues before the credits roll (otherwise you have a heart of stone in my opinion).8 out of 10, I selfishly took away 1 star because it didn't end the way I wanted hehe :)"
" Beautiful film
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,10,"Ignore the utter morons giving crap reviews ...
They're just A***holes & haters for no good reason !
One of those lovely films that put a smile on your face !"
" Worth Every Minute
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,9,"I really appreciated how this movie played out, adequately depicting a couple who have loss and pain and how much we take for granted. I felt drawn towards these characters, especially kind-hearted Louisa (Emilia Clarke), who has such a caring heart, that when she found employment as a care giver for a Quadriplegic named William (Sam Claflin), you feel like you are part of their life, you laugh at the humour they both bring into the situation, and in their pain, I discovered a glimmer of hope, life and love as they cope day by day. Charles Dance, Janet McTeer, Jenna Coleman (Clara, Dr. Who) and Joanna Lumley (AbFab) are supporting actors. To tell you the truth, I didn't have enough Kleenex."
" loved it until I saw a video on youtube called (WHY I HATE ME BEFORE YOU ), so sad
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,5,This movie was a great for me until I watched that video and realized how bad this movie hurt disabled people!!!!!! so if anybody that is disabled should kill themselves in pride and say I don't do anything I just sit!!!. just listen to that man on youtube and you will agree with every word of him. I hope the writer of the book was more aware not to hurt people's feelings!! I rate the scripts and the hurtful words and the story 0 but the acting of Emilia and Sam absoulutely 10. she could wrote a positive story that gives hope to everyone !!
" Read the books too!!!
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,10,"I love the books, and I love love love this movie😇💗😍💝💕"
" Definitely read the book (6.7)
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,7,"Adapting a book to a movie is really hard work but wasn't bad in this movie, missed some events and even some of the main characters like his sister it wasn't bad anyway, but again, it's hard to adapt a book to a movie.I could not get the emotions I got from the book from the movie. I was not upset in the same way but it was enjoyable to enter music and of course the places were magnificent, it was chosen better than I imagined.
it was a pleasant movie, however, the best work place choices made by the movie."
" A very good choice for emotional movie lovers.
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,9,"The movie subject and the acting are very successful. The actors are very well chosen. The places chosen for the scene of Movie were chosen very carefully. In a nutshell, the movie is worth watching in all respects."
" More than a good movie
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,9,Wonderful movies And amazing performance of Amelia
" Must watch
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,8,A very poignant movie.. it would be perfect if it had a happy ending
" a cheesy load of clichés with very twisted moral values
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,3,"Pretty much everything wrong with the story, acting isnt as bad as people say, not good either though. but the story... not really sure how to describe it, it is so morally twisted that it is hard to believe this movie was made by adults. so, the working class girl is helping this filthy rich guy (and yes: the clichés. all of them) , who i belive is supposed to be portrayed as charming and likeable, altough thats not the case at all. the guys is totally spoiled and selfish. neither the girl nor the guy give a damn about the girls long term boyfriend and his feelings, and we are supposed to dislike him too for not giving a birthday present good enough. the guys keeps on making these ""funny"" jokes about the girls looks and makes it awkwardly clear that he would be dating hotter girls if he werent paralysed. and again, he is seriously intended to be a likeable character. also every problem seems to be solved with money, including killing yourself and letting your loved ones in grief: you just book 'em a flight to paris and give them a load of money and they'll seem to feel perfectly ok after literally couple of weeks since your passing. also there is a great moral teaching about being physically disabled is not a life wort living, especially if you are used to live a great jetset life travelling around the world with unlimited trustfund money.at the same time everything seems to be always nice and neat despite the disability. the movie really does not do justice to the effort that real care workers put in... and it does not begin to describe the difficulties of a everyday life of disabled person. on top of all theres the cheesy soundtrack with ed sheeran sugarpop songs super out of place...horrible piece of storytelling and cinema. do not bother. there are lots of great movies over the same subject out there:
if you're looking a feel good movie, choose the intouchables.
if youre in the mood for great drama with deep and beautiful ideas over life, death and dignity, go with Sea Within"
" boring and predictable
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,1,"The actress is very annoying, with average acting and boring storyline"
" Polished, but misleading
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,7,"I knew what this was about and how it was going to end. But I ill wanted to give it a try. I hoped that there could be showed different opinions, but instead I just watched movie based on emotions and egos.
The main thought of the story is that people need to repect other's decisions and just show love and support. And this idea isn't that bad. But the topic of illness is more serious than just a matter of choice.
I believe that every story gives viewers/readers ideas. Personally I like motivational stories that show road to success. While this story is quite depressing. I could compare ""Me before you"" with ""Million Dollar Baby"". Viewers remember how hard Hilary Swank tried her best that's why the ending was strong and touching. In ""Me before you"" I see no strength, only depression.
Because of that depresed main character it was also impossible for me to see romantic story here. He seems to be too deep inside his own world to show interest in others.
I think he wanted to return ""perfect"" himself. WHy do I think that there is no perfect life?
So, in the end, it's all a fiction story. Moreover, there is a sequal book. Just like 50 shades, right?
I read book based on REAL life.I recommend you to read Nich Vujicic books. No fiction there. Or watch Lorenzo's Oil
This movie is a pretty picture with pretty actors. I can't recommend it because of the message and depressing aura."
" Gets you into your feelings.
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,10,"I read the book before I watched the movie. I am hoping, if the make the other two books in the trilogy, that Emma Clarke and Sam Claflin will continue to portray the main characters.This movie appeals to the hopeless romantic side of me, Sam Claflin plays his part remarkably well, his looks and charm are an added bonus.Did need Kleenex through parts of the movie but is one I watch over and over."
" well
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,7,"This movie is not only about love, but also about the beauty of the soul, and about life and death.

" Me Before Emilia Clarke's Eyebrows
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,3,"I saw this movie twice. The first time was in theatres when it came out. I remember I didn't like it at all, but that could have been because my aunt was sobbing next to me throughout the entire movie and I had to supply her with tissues.
I watched it again more recently after having read the book, and I have to say...it wasn't better.
I give it 3 stars because I like the fact that Jojo Moyes, who wrote the book, also wrote the script so the film stays mostly true to the novel. I also don't mind Sam Claflin's performance, and Emilia Clarke was casted perfectly. I did manage to laugh a handful of times at the beginning at some of the wittier lines.
That is all I have to say about the movie that's good. Otherwise, all of the acting seemed off and I spent more time watching Emilia Clarke's eyebrows than anything else. The soundtrack was absolutely awful, the music was overbearing and just didn't seem to fit the tone of the overall film. In comparison to the book, this was just too rushed. Everything happened so quickly, and the admirable aspects of the book were taken out of the film because it was either deemed unnecessary or too dark to include in an already pretty dark film, considering the end result.
As I said, there are a few chuckles early on, but it quickly gets boring. The best part is when Louisa asks wheelchair-ridden Will to dance with her and the first line of Ed Sheeran's ""Thinking Out Loud"" starts playing. (When your legs don't work like they used to before)"

",2020-05-04 00:00:00,9,Very sad story that cuts heart and show that a man Without faith in God he never can't be strong and face life's hardships. God sent him a such beautiful Love and Quietness to help him endure his new life and enjoy it Unfortunately he had refused!!
" Wrong on all levels
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,1,This story is so wrong and horrible I can't even begin to describe it. It sums up what is wrong with society for me. Vile.
" I really love this movie
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,9,"Throughout the first half of the movie, I didn't feel very special or moved. According to the story development of most romantic films, I thought that the following would be the ending of the perfect combination of love, warmth and influence of the heroine, and positive smile on the life of the hero. What I didn't expect is that the scriptwriter's setting of the ending actually separated the two people who love each other forever, and the hero finally chose to die in the way of euthanasia to leave the world. The heroine saw her beloved left, although the heart pain but also calmly accepted the fact. Because she knew in her heart will was not happy in this world, and though she was never loved, at least the one she loved was free. It's hard not to feel a little sad about the ending, but come to think of it, it's probably the best arrangement for both the leading man and the leading lady."

" Me before You
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,7,"At around 1 hour and 30 minutes, the familiar ""Don't forget about me"" sounded, and the desolation and plot in the cloves sound perfectly matched. The choice and torment of the same kind-even if you love deeply, you must let it go, you may face it, even if you experience Completely copied, because the emotions are connected, the music can touch people's hearts and burst into tears. Clark looked out the window, and when he looked at Will, who was asleep, it was also the most beautiful time in the movie.
Me before you, I think it can be translated as before meeting you, after losing you.
Me before you is a different life for the two in the movie, the change of life trajectory may be good or bad, but grateful to meet, grateful for love.
Instead of changing with a perfect ending, it appears real, and there are not so many perfections and dreams in life. Helplessness and impermanence are more normal, and the experience and love in them make the seemingly meaningless life become meaningful, before or after."
" ME BEFORE YOU! My Favourite. 100% Recomended
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,10,"How do you move on after losing the person you loved? The person that unconditionally started to mean everything to you? How do you build a life worth living?
Well, JOJO MOYES, the author, beautifully writes the answer.
ME BEFORE YOU is one of my favourite movie. The number of times I saw this movie, I had tears in my eyes. Literally, it's a must watch. Let's move on to the review.LOU CLARK; the bumblebee leggings lover girl, knows many things. The footsteps between the bus stop to her home, the feeling of love, and all the sweet feelings she has. But what she doesn't know is that she might not love her boyfriend who is just self-concerned, and she lost her job and don't know what is coming to her in the near future. Where her life is taking her.
She is a determined, strong and caring girl with big dreams. When she lost her job, she saw an advertisement for nursing a patient who is paralyzed. LOU took this chance and made a funky entry in WILL's life. <3
What if the person in front of you was the person full of life, full of colours, full of joys? But the accident makes him a colourless, selfless person who is dependent on his Parents, and nurse. That is not the life he wanted. He did not want the life without his legs, he walks with. He LOVED his life. WILL Loved his life.Will suffers a traffic accident that leaves him paralyzed in a wheelchair. Will has given up on ever living a fulfilling life again and wants his parents, Camilla and Steven Traynor, to allow him to go through with assisted suicide.WILL is the character without hope, the accident made him so. His girlfriend left him and married his friend. But After LOU, life was not the same. not as before but better.LOU, this character made me feel that one person can change your life and has the ability to make you realise that life is a gift. You have to celebrate each and every moment of life.
Life is not given to you to live like a normal person. I guess it demands some craziness, love, celebration, taking care, adventures & Thrill. To compete with your problem is it really courageous and brave and it is the real LIFE is all about.I am going to add the last part of the letter, WILL wrote to LOU. And seriously, this letter has my heart and these words have given me hope and courage.""You're going to feel uncomfortable in your new world for a bit. But I hope you feel a bit exhilarated too. Live boldly. Push yourself. Don't settle. Just live well. Just live. Love, Will.""
See you soon with another Heavy review!"

.
""-You can't change who people are
-Then what can you do?
-You love them""
.
I watched this movie for the first time soon after it released. And I don't remember how many times I have seen this movie since then. In my brightest and in my saddest moment of my life this movie kept me going. It gave me hope, hope to live, hope to dream, hope to love. When I am watching this today for the millionth of time, I am still crying just like the first time I cried watching this.
This movie taught me how love should be and taught me to not expect impossible things from love, life.
Remember the dancing scene at Alicia's wedding where Lou and Will talk and laugh about how if things were different there wasn't any chance for them knowing each other and being friends. That is the most beautiful scene I have ever watched. That taught me love is honesty. Love is accepting people in their truest self and doing every possible thing to make them happy. Love is believing in time when they might not be together but everything will still be going beautifully for the other person.
Every scene in this movie is a pleasure to my eye. Every dialogue is more beautiful than the previous one. And @emilia_clarke is so phenomenal it's hard to not laugh when she laughs and cry when she cries. And.... Sam Claflin! Well, you @mrsamclaflin are pretty much everything that made me believe we all deserve a second chance :') Do I need to say how much I love this movie?
No. Right? :')"
" Stop at the moment of the concert
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,8,"Although I 've read the novel before, I sneered at the bestseller-like setting in the middle of the movie. At the end of the movie, Will 's letter still made people cry.
As I said before, who can actually fall in love depends entirely on the point in time when God chooses to put you in the same cage with whom. If Will has never been trapped by accident, then he will never have the leisure to understand and love. Louise
At this time, fate is involved irrevocably, fate is a dangerous move, and those who are entangled will always meet.
So one of the great luck in life is just that the person he likes is unmarried and healthy, regardless of his age and when will he meet him?
I hope I can love you, I also hope that when I love you, I am still you, you are still you, I hope the word love is not a reason to bind each other, I hope you are more free than me
You do n't have to be miserable. You want to live better with my share. I just hope you can meet and be yourself, just like I 've been trying to become me before I met you.
What could be more gentle and powerful than this? Use your light to illuminate my path brightly and darkly. Fortunately, I met in this life, even if you are the only bodhi in the desert."
" Poignancy Not to Be Missed
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,9,"There have been films that have dealt with this same subject that have come before this one. Some have done it well. None, however, have lifted me, tugged at every emotion, and allowed me (an older man) to weep honestly. It is that simple for me.That being stated, I tend to view films by looking at underlying features--the directing, the sound track, music, cinematography, and the acting. All were excellent in Me Before You. Kudos to Emilia Clarke, Sam Claflin, Jo Jo Moyes, and all others involved.Thank you for letting and older man enjoy this beauty."
" Although the ending ... but I still feel that this movie has the power to heal people
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,8,"I read this novel before watching this movie. I have to say that the protagonist of the movie is quite different from the protagonist described in the novel. At least, I think the male protagonist in the movie is not as handsome, decent and strong as the movie. The rhythm of the story in the novel is very slow, the film is well adapted, and the ending touched me a little."

" A movie made so well that even people who don't like romance movies can watch it
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,8,"As a major fan of the book I have put off watching the movie for a while, as I felt it could never even be nearly as good as the book. But to my surprise it is. Emilia Clarke does an amazing job playing Louisa Clark, almost as though she was made for it. But the biggest respect goes out to Sam Claflin, who seemed to effortlessly portrait the role of Will Traynor. Moving your arms around, or poses in general are quite a big thing when it comes to acting, but he could only move his head and still had to make sure that it was clear what he meant, using only his face. He deserves a lot more credit for that than he is getting. With this golden duo the movie can't be anything other than great. The only thing I would change is the ending. Compared to the rest of the movie it seems a bit rushed. Personally I think that even people who don't like romantic movies could really enjoy this one."
" Smart Emilia taking care of a guy or touching love in difficult conditions
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Melodrama. A film adaptation of the novel of the same name by the famous English writer Giorgio Moyes, known for her love affairs, she also made the script here, which pleases. I am sure that there are differences from the book, but I will have no desire to familiarize myself with the original source, therefore I will consider the picture as an independent work. So, Emilia, for the sake of you, I decided to watch - and it was definitely worth it. And here is my brief opinion - touching love in difficult conditions. I want to note that I did not find any minuses in the picture, although I watched it very carefully, trying to notice every detail, therefore I intend to dwell on the advantages of this film adaptation and at one serious point that it raises.
So here they are:
1. Outfits of Emilia - this was told to me by a person who advised me on this picture (well, because of Emilia), so I was ready for anything - but the picture could surprise me. I thought that a red dress would be the height of the creators' ingenuity, but it was only a seed before the parade of dresses, swimwear, blouses and other things that awaited me when watching. Costumers really tried their best. The craziest ideas came to life on the screen - and that's good! I literally enjoyed every outfit of Emilia. However, what can a nearly thirty-year-old Russian guy living in the provinces know about fashion!
2. Love line - here it is the center around which history is formed. It would seem that everything is simple - a provincial girl becomes a servant of a young disabled person chained to a wheelchair. At first, there is antipathy between them, gradually turning into love, and the real one. I saw many love lines on the big screen, and in this regard it is very difficult to surprise me. This line was not surprising, but the actors really tried. Emilia and Sam did not portray love, but loved each other for real. There is no falsity between them. The actors did not care, and this is the most important thing! Viewers appreciated this, and a picture with a twenty-million budget was able to raise almost two hundred and ten million dollars worldwide. People cannot be fooled.
3. Music - it is calm, creates the right mood, namely, romantic, a little serene, but gradually it changes to hopeless, oppressive and sometimes desperate. There are no catchy melodies, but I will praise the composer for his good work.
4. Camera work - a castle, a small town, a luxurious house of a rich man, resorts and so on are shot at a high level. Sometimes I caught myself thinking that I admire the views more than I read the dialogues (I watched a picture in English with Russian subtitles in order to appreciate the original voices, which I'm very happy about).
5. Euthanasia - the picture raises this difficult topic and answers it herself. I do not pretend to be the ""chief moralist of All Russia"", but simply express my position on this matter. I perfectly understand both the supporters of this practice and its opponents. But, starting from my worldview and education, I believe that life is a gift from the Lord, and we have no right to interrupt it on our own, no matter how hard it is for us. The Lord knows when our time will come, but how we manage the time allotted to us is already on our conscience. The hero of the picture decided so, but it is his choice. By the way, it was precisely because of this that the picture was criticized at the time, saying that it was ""propaganda"" and everything that came out of here, both here and in the West. Let everyone determine their position on this issue independently. And yes, I judge the question from a philistine point of view, but I witnessed several heartbreaking events, which I will not discuss, for the memories are still very fresh.
A little about the main characters:
1. Louise Clark performed by Emilia Clark (sorry for the tautology, but I'm not to blame) - a simple modest girl, in view of the difficult financial situation, is a servant of a young disabled person chained to a stroller, not yet knowing how this will turn her life upside down. The difficulties that Louise is faced with are more relevant than ever, even now in Russia, apparently in the West, the situation is similar, therefore the heroine immediately attracts attention. Her modesty and decency are truly captivating, and her recklessness and sometimes easy pretense - fall in love. I already talked about outfits, but I repeat that they're not simply lovely! The acting is at a high level. I was glad that she didn't laugh wildly in the picture, otherwise I would just finish watching right at this moment. Emilia knows how to show off talent when she wants. Amy's whole pen!
2. William Trainor, played by Sam Klaflin, is a young man, the son of wealthy parents, whose life was suddenly overturned by a terrible catastrophe, as a result of which he became a wheelchair invalid, his former optimism and confidence disappeared somewhere, his taste for life lost its meaning until he Louise met, which made him feel alive again. Sam really pleased me, he showed a controversial hero fighting on the verge of life and death, love and despair, grief and happiness. I have not seen Sam in any picture, but he played just fine. Well done!
I was glad to see the powerful Charles Dance as the father of William.
As for the tearful moments, they exist, but they didn't make such a deep emotional impression on me as the picture ""Christmas for Two"" did. I can't do anything about it. I was open to this picture, there was no skepticism (unlike ""Voices from the stone"", where it turned out to be true) - but there is no effect. Of all three paintings, only ""Christmas for Two"" could knock out tears (and already three times in a row). Many wrote that the heroines of Emilia in both paintings are similar, I agree, but only half. ""See you"" I liked it, but I'm unlikely to review it. But I understand the audience, who simply adore her and love her - that's great.
As a result, we have an excellent melodrama about touching love in difficult conditions with wonderful acting by Emilia Clark and Sam Klaflin, atmospheric music and a raised, far ambiguous theme.
My rating is 8 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!"
" Fantastic Romantic Movie
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,8,"Absolutely brilliant film. Those who criticise it for dealing with the subject of disabilty should look past the fact Will is disabled and look at the film in the light of what it aims to be, a touching, romance film. Emelia Clarke is great. Sam Claflin is brilliant. A definite must see film."
" Guzaarish told this story better.
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,8,"Let me clarify, I did love this move I thought it was beautifully done. However, I had seen the Bollywood movie called Guzaarish years before this and there is just no comparison. Guzaarish is very much similar to this story, almost identical in parts. It's pretty obvious the storyline from this movie was taken & inspired from Guzaarish although altered a bit. I almost didn't want to watch this when I first saw the preview. Most people will have never seen Guzaarish and I understand that but they are truly missing out. It is one of the most gorgeous & magical movies I have ever seen. Me before You was definitely missing the magical, whimsical elements that Guzzarish brought to the screen, especially the breathtaking cinematography. All of that being said you really have to see the original inspiration movie Guzzarish to completely appreciate this movie for what it is. I would have given it a 10 but that belongs to Guzzarish. If you get a chance to watch it, definitely do. You'll see what I mean."
" going to watch soon.
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,10,"The movie is good. Just look at the movie cover. just from that I already know what's going to happen. A guy will stand on the edge of the grand canyon, and on the other edge, directly across, is the woman. Both of them see one another. Once they see each other they start transferring energy into what they do at double the rate. The guy throws his yoyo into the canyon while staring straight forward and the woman sets her watch so it only displays 0's. She yells ""me before you,"" and he yells ""No, you before me. Once one jumps, so does the other. They jump across the canyon, meeting in the air at the half way point. One looking at the others ankles, the other copying. And they land across from one another again, taking each others former positions."

Her no nonsense, goofy ways force him to reconnect with life and the pair eventually develop feelings for one another.This movie belongs to Emilia Clarke, you just can't take your eyes off her happy, quirky, goofy, expressive, exceptionally nice, what expression will her face take next character. And what weird clothes will she wear be wearing? Great supporting cast here too especially enjoyed Stephen Peacocke as the nurse and fellow GOT alumni Charles Dance as the dad.I was a huge fan of the book, it broke my heart (understatement) and they've done a decent job here of telling JoJo Moyes story."
" Same problem of LaLaLand
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,4,"Why would you want a sad and lame ending? It's underwhelming and disappointing. Happy endings aren't cliche, in fact, are fulfilling and encouraging for the soul."
" Romantic Dramas are often a hit or miss
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,8,"But this movie brought a very solemn smile and tear to my face when I watched it. I genuinely loved this movie. I had two reasons to go watch it in theaters when it came out. 1.) I love Emilia's performance in GOT and wanted to check this out. 2.) I have been needing to drag my boyfriend out to watch it with me.In the end , Clarke and Claflin have great chemistry, and my heart truly broke when the movie was coming to an end. Most people who hated this movie have told me ""Oh, it promotes the suicide of the disabled,"" but that isn't true. I have a friend who is disabled. Paraplegic, and she basically lives in her wheelchair except when she needs assistance to get to other places. I wanted to get her view on it, so I took her to watch the movie 2 weeks later. When the movie finished she was in tears. She gave me a pat on my lap and asked for a hug and whispered ""Thank you"" into my ears. She is a huge sap for romance movies, she explained how it was touching that a movie was touching on the idea of people on life support who find it a struggle to survive. She said that yes, it was unfortunate that William wanted to end his life, it made her happy to see that he was cared for by person who loved him and he didn't die in vain, but with a sense of fulfillment.Maybe it might send mixed messages, but hearing firsthand from a friend who basically told she knows what its like to be William that this movie wasn't insulting to her made me happy and brought a tear to my eye. Humanity is failing to know what love truly means. People tend to go the looks, wealth and lust in relationship at first, but we forget the friendship, the bond and company that love brings, which is why so many relationships fail nowadays. And this movie shows that everyone is deserving of a chance to love. Even the more challenged people are deserving of love. This movie sends a lovely sentiment, and I am glad I saw this movie."

The story is so happy and sad .the movie is not really long .I like the context( small town of England ) .In my opignion is the happy music . When i read the plot ( a girl in small town forms unlikely band with a rencently paralyzed she's taking car of ) i thought this movie was boring but when i watched tht movie i loved it. i think it's a movie you have to see"
" Not worth it
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,1,"Emilia Clarke's acting was awful, overreacted and gesticulating so much with her eyebrows that it's distracting. The rest of the cast was not bad.
The problem is that there are SO MANY plot holes that it's really annoying. How on earth a family like that would choose to employ her, for what exactly? Someone with no qualifications in nursing, let alone CPR? Without the means to carry out a clever conversation with their son, who clearly comes from a very different world and background? So they hired her for her pretty face? Hoping he'd fall for her? What about his family, they never seem to keep him company, even though they begged him to stay with them.
And like this, There are many, many problems with the plot. Her boyfriend? Her fashion sense? Her family?
Really disappointing."

So the basic message is; you're disabled (no matter how loved or rich or good looking you are) therefore life is not worth living? That is the core message of this load of crap.

If you want to watch something real and heart warming, watch it, you won't be disappointed and you will most likely cry a bit."
" Movie is good but at the end
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,5,"I would I like to tell that the movie goes in a very good manner at the end of the movie; I felt like this is a romantic advertisement for ""Dignitas"". I don't feel a motivation was given to the guy to live his life facing challenges. I understand that guy couldn't do anything but it doesn't mean he has to die. Okay anyhow that's how the movie goes. Advertisement of Dignitas."
" Just proves how good the AGOT direction was..
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,1,"Truly awful ""film"" with the production values of a cheap soap opera episode from the 80's. Clarke with no direction relies on facial ticks to cover up the fact she can't act. The message of the film is sickening and every actor in the movie will not want this horrifying accidental comedy to be on their resume. I can only imagine that the 10 star reviews are from pre teen girls who some how think this is what a love story should be and as millennial smart phone addicts they have never seen any proper love story film made before they were born. Awful film but when watched while reading the outstanding negative reviews on here it actually becomes an amazing comedy."
" Who's that girl?
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,10,"My daughter is the most beautiful girl in the world. The BEST second choice is Miss Emilia Clarke (same age)!
What a wonderful girl is she.!
What an excellent and charming actress is she!
You may say ""English movie"" and it says it all.
A thousand thanks to all the participants of this film for the extreme pleasance and enjoyment you offered to me.
And I swear I'll not miss a film of Miss Magic Emilia Clarke.
God proves his presence in many strange ways!"
" This poor boyfriend
",2019-08-05 00:00:00,6,"I mean the story is weird I don't know how to feel about it but I really feel sorry for her boyfriend he did nothing wrong and yet she ditched him over a vegetable
6 out of ten
Just because emilia Clarke is hot
And her acting was good
And cause I felt sorry for the guy at the end of it"
" Just as good as the book!
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,10,"I loved the book and have read all in the series. The movie does not disappoint. This is definitely a chick flick. (My husband would hate it.) And if that's your thing, you'll love it. Great performances, beautiful scenery."
" Bad acting
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,1,"Emilia Clarke is a bad actress. Sam Claflin clearly didn't read the book before accepting the job. Because he nothing like the brilliant, bitter, cynic Will in the book."
" so saddening

" Horrible just horrible

" Amazing
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,10,A very beautiful and emotional movie! Emilia was perfect for the role and was so adorable!
" Not a fan at all
",2019-06-22 00:00:00,4,"I really liked the book. I've re-read the book a couple of times and loves it. I was so exited for the movie but honestly it sucked. The whole part why Lou and Will fell in love is just bad. You don't really see how Will get Louisa to live and start exploring ger own life, while you don't understamd Will's pain at all and how much he hates hus life. Natan is not a character that is even necessary in the movie, while he is inte of the mist important ones in the book. The only good thing about this movie is the actors. They did a great job to catch the characters personalitiys."
" I had more expected
",2019-06-16 00:00:00,6,"Well sorry to say that but Emilia was sucks.If you want compere this movie to others in this genre like The fault in our stars, Its not worth it. Its just good to watch once. The female charactore was horrible but at least you could accept male actor"
" This movie is great?!
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,10,"I realy didn't watch any movie like this, it's adorible. I realy like Clark's smile it's so sweet."
" Nice movie
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,10,"It is a great movie but the ends with a pessimistic message. Everyone has a life, and everyone has problems but getting rid of problems by getting rid of life is not a solution. I believe movie could have ended with hope and showing how beautiful life is."
" Touching movie
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,8,"One of the best romantic movies I've ever seen
Thank u Emilia Clark for that outstanding performance"

Just the last part was sad..."
" The first time.... Lol

" Watched 6 times and counting
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,10,"The kind of movie i dindn't liked at firt, but after that i started to think why Will would do that and when you try to put yourself at his situation you kind get it. And i think most man will understand him better than woman"
" Incredible,beautiful
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,10,It broke my heart seeing this movie. It is so beautiful.😍Will and Louisa they should have been together.
" great story
",2019-05-22 00:00:00,10,"I like how realistic this movie is, I am not into silly happy ending.. we always hear people preaching how to be strong against disability, cancer and such.. no one knows what it's like except the affected person. I don't see a negative message in this movie.. great acting, nice music... I give it a 10"
" moving & beautifully written
",2019-05-17 00:00:00,8,"Impeccably done! What a heart wrenching storyline! The film is beyond beautiful and the aura that it creates is beyond feelings, admired every scene. The reality of it was eye opening and the imagery was absolutely stunning. Overall, Me Before You is a rich and powerful movie featuring incredible performances."
" Perfect Romance
",2019-05-17 00:00:00,10,I think it was the best romance that i've ever seen !!
" Heartache
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie is such a heartache. Cried so much that i could rate this movie more than 10. I'm just torn on Will's decision, thought love can heal him. Movie was so great but I still wish they end up happy together. It's a relief to know that Clark might've given him new rays in his life to go and continue living."
" I love this movie
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,10,"Most beautiful love story. I love this movie because this film's idea so interesting. I can't stop watching this movie so exciting too watch again and again. One thing everyone should one is no matter how you looks, no matter you have nothing or not just if i love you no matter what i'll choose you till i die. LOVE IT"
" It'll give you a good cry.
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,6,It is hard to appreciate a narrative that can only skim the surface but then again Emilia and Sam's chemistry makes you buy into their cozy world.
" Absolutely love it
",2019-05-06 00:00:00,10,Thoroughly love the film and I consider it a must watch for any romantic (probably not a good one to Netflix and chill with). The film is an emotional rollercoaster so buckle up
" Great acting, worthless story
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,5,"If it wasn't for the brilliant performance of Clarke and Clafin, my rating would be zero. Jojo had the ability to send many horrible messages in just one book - about euthanasia, about disabled people, about love ... in the end I got the impression that he resorted to euthanasia, even admitting that life can be good after such an accident, because it was no longer as it was before, and in the meantime he had fun with the poor girl, kind of a diversion in the last days, after a decision that was never in doubt, which he kept secret until the last minute even after knowing her feelings and her total surrender to him - the film ends with a message and a sum of money to give her a little help ... and saying ""Just live"" - wich is the oposite from the film message...meaningless this story, is not worth our time. I didn´t know Jojo before seeing the movie, and I certainly will not read anything from this source."
" Intouchables meet Bridget Jones
",2019-04-30 00:00:00,5,"The concept of a caregiver forming an unlikely bond with a quadriplegic man who has suffered an accident. And in a wonderfully humorous and unsentimental way both the French ""Intouchables"" and ""Me before You"" give a warm peek into what can happen if the right caregiver accidentally (pardon the pun) comes along. And Emilia Clarke is absolutely disarmingly charming as the Bridget-Jones-clumsy girl with the funny clothes and the big heart. However, where Intouchables have a slightly dark undertone, which gives more facets to the plot, ""Me before You"" becomes a little too much of a banal love story (in spite of the subject of euthanasia). I was entertained, but the film certainly lacked some ""je ne sais quoi""."
" AMAZING
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,10,This is one of the best romance movies I have ever seen. I highly recommend it to everyone.
" Imitative
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,5,"It's a mixture of The Intouchable and many love stories which produced before, noting new"
" A Fine Romance Film
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,7,"ME BEFORE YOU is a pretty good take on the romance film. It's not a romantic comedy by any stretch, but more of a sort of drama that has something to say. And whichever way you feel about the issues presented here (even the main characters share conflicting and ambiguous views about them) you will certainly enjoy this.What makes it good is that it's not too cheesy, like so many other films of its kind. Admittedly, it feels a little cheesy toward the start, but it never crosses the line. There are some good laughs and you may even cry too. The acting is great, as is the script and the directing. I feel like the roles were perfectly cast. It's hard to imagine another group of actors would do as good of a job. Recommend."
" 10 + + +
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,10,"A ten plus film and acting work. No question Emilia Clarke is an outstanding actress and a wonderful star. All the actors, direction, script and production details are exquisite."
" Just like IRL there's not always a happily ever after!
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,8,"Many people are unfairly rating this movie very low based on being their moral pomposity. This movie doesn't speak for every paraplegic or disabled person, but guess what just like in real life some disabled individuals, both physically and mentally, as well as some seemingly able bodied decide that their quality of life or rather lack of is not the way they want to continue living. It is their individual choice! We don't get to decide.
Most of those same reviews also note that he's some selfish billionaire that wants to die because he doesn't have everything he wants. How shallow. It implies if he'd been a working class Joe he'd of been more accepting of his disability, not necessarily! My impression is that he would have given up the riches to be able bodied again. As an able bodied person I don't dare judge his decision to decide his own quality of life given his severe physical disability. I would hope quadraplegics understand that not all people are willing to ""adapt and overcome""! I have told my husband I would not want to live in a vegetative state. It's not a quality of life I envision for myself, but I respect the families that maintain their loved ones in that state. It's an individual choice and we need to respect that. This movie isn't advocating suicide for the disabled but rather advocating individual choice which I believe is an inherit right!"
" JUST OKAY - (5 stars out of 10)
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,5,"The stage curtains open ...""Me Before You"" has a glorified made-for-tv kind of flair, but manages to keep you invested, even though the subject matter is treated lightly and without the due that's deserved.When Louisa ""Lou"" Clark loses her job unexpectedly, she is forced to try and find income to help out her family during tough times. She is twenty-six, has a steady boyfriend of 7 years, and not very ambitious. In fact, she is quite happy and content being a small town girl who has no designs on ever leaving and becoming anything other than what she already is. But when she is hired on to help Will Trainor, a young man involved in an accident that leaves him paralyzed and confined to a wheel chair, she begins to have a new outlook on life when she does her best to try and brighten his.I can't say that this film is predictable - but at the same time, I can. There are only two definite endings this story can have. My reviews are spoiler free, so I won't divulge the ending other than to say, I didn't care for it. I really don't like the message that it leaves behind as the end credits begin to roll. But enough about that ...This is just okay. Nothing special. It is endearing, cute in parts and heartwarming in others ... but overall it is rather plain. Emilia Clarke was adorable in her role, but just a little too pretentious and ""cutesy"". Sam Claflin didn't sell me at all in his role. He was just a pretty face for the girl to fall for, and there were no raw emotions or struggles displayed on his part. This is not a recommend - maybe worth one watch, but nothing more."
" The right to death with dignity?
",2019-04-05 00:00:00,6,"We all have the right to a life of dignity... but what about the right to death with dignity?Financial wizard, Will Traynor is a quadriplegic (paralysis from the shoulders down) who's living at home with his parents in a castle that lies on the edge of a small English village. He's been paralyzed for 2 years and despite all his efforts at physical therapy only has movement in his thumb plus facial muscles. His parents have created a safe environment for him: a conversion of their large castle's stables into a comfortable home, a male nurse to feed, clean, bathe and change him and now a friendly, quirky companion in Lou Clarke. Unspoken is Traynor's mother's prayer: Clarke will dissuade Traynor from his self-made appointment with death in six months.Director Thea Sharrock (The Hollow Crown, As You Like It) effectively handles the introduction of this heated, controversial subject in this light romance by giving us the perspective of one life... a life that could go on into the distant future with heavy medical involvement, a life that could continue to contribute to society, a life that could perhaps find satisfaction in this ""lesser"" state. The mostly new-to-feature film director, writer and young leading cast, are well-supported by a cinematographer with decades of experience, Remi Adefarasin OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) (Match Point, About a Boy, Elizabeth).Sam Claflin (Snow White and the Huntsman, The Hunger Games) plays the quadriplegic Traynor, the romance male-lead, with Emilia Clarke (Game of Thrones) his companion. They both have faces that are great for screen closeups, important when bodies can't move. Clarke, famously known for playing Daenerys Targaryen, Mother of Dragons, has a face so mobile her eyebrows seem to do acrobatics far removed from her stoic face in Game of Thrones. She also has a lot more to say in a candid, quirky manner, which soon brings out the mischievous side of Traynor, always up for a dare and adventure. The movie is carried by the two and they do a good job interacting.Me Before You could have been set anywhere in the world, but the castle-village setting suits-if you have a Lord of the Manor character, why not give him one, with the young, naïve love interest played by a village girl. Also to emphasize the wealthy lifestyle is the private jet they use to go on holiday-very fairytale, Mills & Boon romance, a formula that has worked for decades.Dialogue does flow and is well matched to the accompanying actions, not surprising as author Jojo Moyes also wrote the screenplay. The challenge of showing the life extreme-sports-devotee Traynor had before becoming a quadriplegic is easily and effectively solved when Clarke finds a short video (set to James Bond music) of Traynor doing many athletic feats-diving off cliffs into the sea, water skiing, bungy/sky jumping-narrated by a group of his admiring friends. Traynor definitely craved and loved physical adventure and his body was very toned and fit. Cut to his life now, immobile, needing assistance even to lift his head off his pillow or sitting, staring fixedly out of the window at the flat, colourless countryside, the only thing still agile being his mind and slowly recovering sense of humour.The right to a dignified life for all is cemented in most constitutions across the globe. To choose when to die is something only provided for in some places, and only for those who have reached the hospice state of care when the doctor certifies that the patient only has a short period of time left to live, that death is inevitable from illness, disease, or injury, and that there are no medical interventions that can change this. At such a time the patient can choose death assisted by medical staff. But what if one is stuck in between: a diminished physical life that cannot improve but continues with high medical care and cost and still an acute mental ability. If such a person decides against living, are there ethical, social, moral, religious, spiritual, personal rights to be observed? Protected? Should that person too be allowed to choose death, or is it ""murder"" as one of the support actors states.This is one of several books, movies and documentaries I've seen recently on the right to choose death, something many with the means have been doing for a time now. Well worth a watch, the viewer can take from it what they choose: the light-hearted fare of a chick-flick or the deeper philosophical discussion."
" The most harmful movie i have ever had the misfortune to see
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,1,"As others have pointed out the messages in this one are so bad that it borders on actual nazi propaganda.
Worse still the message isnt presented in a controversial way with a dialectic, but just as something the main character has to accept. If it at least was presented in any way from a balanced point of view the excuse that ""it's a difficult topic"" could have held.
The characters when examined closer under the criteria of what they do, how they do it and what they get for their actions, are all awful people.
Absolutely disgusting and lacking redeeming qualities apart from nice camerawork.
Awful and condemnable. I dread to think what sort of influence this could have on a developing mind. Everyone involved with this should seriously reevaluate their life perspectives."
" Was awesome
",2019-03-28 00:00:00,10,"I haven't read the book yet, but I knew I had to see it. I cried a lot at the end this movie has to be one of favorites"
" Splendid.
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,10,"Me Before You is a simple yet beautiful film, Emilia Clarke captures the heart.Clarke has taken on various roles without a blemish, she's an excellent actress. Sam Claflin, believable in the role as well. A quality soundtrack accompanies the film. Many dislike the ending, but not me as the film is about Lou and it allows her to move on with fondness and opportunity ahead. They always go overboard concerning the current boyfriend, being a complete jerk. In regards to Will's circumstance, I didn't see an accident or a mistake, I saw carelessness."
" Ablist garbage
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,1,"This movie is ablist trash and honestly I'm surprised that the author got away with never interviewing an actual person who has quadriplegia and main source of information on the subject cams from a family who helped their child with quadriplegia commit assisted suicide which wow is maybe a little bit biased no? This author is speaking on a subject as an able bodied person who wants to romantise other peoples realities and basically glorifies a handicapables suicide. If this story was about an able bodied man and his depression his suicide would be tragic, but because her leading man has quadraplegia his death is hailed as a necessary sacrifice for the people he loves. This movie is trash, the love story is trash, and Jojo whatever her name is uses degrading language both in the book and the movie, using terms like ""quads"" which news flash isn't how people with quadraplegia refer to themselves which she might know if she ever bothered to interview one. As someone who works in the medical field this movie is a nightmare and I would hate for any of the people I know who have similar medical needs to watch this movie and think that what Sam did was something they should do ""for the sake of their loved ones"". If I could rate it 0/10 I would have. Do yourself a favor and go support people who actually are fighting for the rights of the handicapable community and not trying to kill them off for a plot twist."
" Sweet
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,8,"This movie will have you running through most of your emotions. Plainly put , it's a good story with good actors."
" Proved Me Wrong
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,9,"When my mother clicked on this movie on our TV, I was more than unwelcome. Oh, great. Another sappy love story. But as soon as I started watching it, I was hooked. It gave me another idea of love. Clark made me laugh and Traynor made me agree and nod in reason. This quirky, heartbreaking movie is something special."
" Most beautiful love story
",2019-03-14 00:00:00,10,"The beauty of the love story is. If two person are meant to be fall in love with each other, no boundaries can stop them from loving each other.
I rarely cry during watching movies. This move is a true definition of love& I cried a lot during watching this movie."
" This movie made me cry, I love it !
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,8,"I thought it was beautifully produced. I am really glad I watched the film and I found it uplifting and inspiring. This is absolutely amazing movie. If you interested in romantic, sad love story then this movie is definitely for you. The story of the Louisa Clark, who unfortunately lost her job and Will who devastatingly paralysed after a motorcycle accident. When Louisa enters his life as his new care, she brings a new light to his life and the movie covers how their relationship develops. This movie seems that our life became changed when we met right person and you will understand how we love each other. I understand we must say ""love you and thank you"" for the all time. If we did not tell them, one day we regret it. The acting especially from Emilia Clarke who played Lou was brilliant. There were a couple of small parts that were left out but they certainly did not detract from the movie. A lovely film with a sad ending. Now i am reading this movie's book."
" Me Before You occasionally paralyses itself with romantic clichés but bravely tackles a controversial subject.
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,6,"As someone who does not actively seek out soppy romances (mostly because I like to live in solitude), I found this quirky British love story to be sweet and endearing. It frequently immobilises itself with eye rolling moments, however once the prickly subject of euthanasia takes hold of the script, it drives itself to the finish line (with a tear or two maybe...). Louisa, a young woman desperately looking for a job, becomes the carer of a stubborn quadriplegic. Initially a salty meanie who relishes in his own self-pity, her eccentric personality soon starts to win him over.So, if you've ever seen 'The Untouchables', you'll notice this film plays out almost identically to start with. Two strangers from different backgrounds forming a close bond after spending plenty of time together. It's a rather predictable affair, with this script struggling to inject any sense of heart during the first half. Clarke was wobbly as she forces this eccentric personality by wearing odd fashion choices, constantly babbling and trying her hardest to come across as awkward. The consistent use of Ed Sheehan songs and other romantic pop tracks made the film feel cheap and disposable, appealing to the demographic of radio-listening mums.But then something happened. About halfway through, it dawned on me that this may not have the happy ending I predicted. Euthanasia makes it way to the forefront and surprisingly packs an emotional punch. Clarke and Claflin begin to exhume believable chemistry and I found myself falling in love with them. Don't get me wrong, the script still has many stumbling blocks and overextends it's sentimentality, consequently leading to melodrama. However the film remains sweet throughout, and I appreciate the direction it took whilst adhering to its source material. You understand both Louisa and Will's perspectives on life, without the film forcing this upon you. Also shout out to Lumley who literally only has one minute of screen time (worth it!)."
" What a great movie
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,8,"The thing about this film is that it makes you wonder about the title... who is ""Me"" and who is ""You""... a very nice plot and wonderful cast!"
" Good movie, horrible ending
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,8,"Loved it right up until the ending.
The performances were good, there were heartwarming moments, and funny moments.
But Will be allowed to end it all just cos he couldn't go back to his fabulous old lifestyle was indeed a terrible message, and unexpected, to be honest.
I really thought Lou had changed his mind."
" Loved it
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,10,"I knew nothing about this story until I saw the movie (obviously did not read the book). I loved it! All the actors were great! The chemistry between Claflin and Clarke was undeniable and made the movie.Honestly, I don't understand the criticism of those who said it was saying that disabled people's lives are worthless. Really? It was completely the opposite! Everyone wanted Will to live, but he didn't want to. The movie really made me think about how I would feel in the same situation. I totally understand how Will feels. I can't imagine living like that. But at the same time, I'm not sure I would want to die either. The point is, this is Will's decision. What will he decide? How will the other's react to his decision? Can they change his mind or can they live with it if he doesn't?What really irks me is the whole ""politically correct"" aspect of folks these days. What? A movie isn't allowed to show a disabled person who doesn't want to live? All movies showing severely disabled people must show them 'happy"" at the end with their predicament? This isn't a commentary on what makes a life worthwhile. This is a movie about one particular man who can't imagine living like that. It's not meant to tell the world that if you are disabled, you should kill yourself. Please!The movie is life-affirming but we don't get to choose for someone else. They get to choose for themselves."
" Wish
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,9,"Still to this day I wish he would have changed his mind. She could've kept her happy. But then we understand his point for missing things he used to do and who he was, there was a hole in his heart and didn't wanted to live with the burden."
" Cliché & plain
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,5,"It has some heartwarming scenes, but the whole movie is a typical romantic drama that ends with a dramatic death. It is continuously trying hard to show depth and meaning, but it is just a plain oversimplified story. Clarke's acting is exaggerated and not convincing most of the times. However, the ending is just disturbing! So a handicapped person's life with many achievements, caring and supporting family, and loving girlfriend is not one worth living?"
" Beautiful, Heartbreaking, Amazing
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,10,"This story shows us what love truly is and makes us want to me more like the characters in the story. It shows us that to love someone is more than their appearance and more than what their ""disabilities"" are. It shows that love is when we care about someone so much that when we have to let go it takes makes every single part of us hurt, but we still let them go because we love them. Jojo Moyes is also known for the trilogy to this book, the movie ""Head Full of Honey"", and coming out with her new movie, ""Last Letter from Your Lover"". This movie is sort of similar to ""The Notebook"" or ""The Fault in Our Stars"". It is also sort of similar to the new movie ""The Upside"", however, this story is its own. I think that older teenagers to adults should watch this movie. It has a great story line that sometimes requires a little bit of reading between the lines and having a little bit of background information. I also would recommend reading the book and then watching the movie because the book adds a little more information that sometimes isn't explained in the movie so then by the time you do watch the movie it makes more sense."
" Not horrible, but not great either
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,7,"I am sorry to say this but either Emilia Clarke is not a good actress, or the director sucks at directing. Her performance was a little too exaggerated and almost comical. I don't think this was meant to be a comedy, but maybe it was...? Possibly so, at least Lou and Patrick seemed like they were supposed to be funny.The storyline was okay but not believable.
Maybe it's better to read the book; it could well be that they edited out too much information?? but I wasn't convinced that Will absolutely had to make that awful decision.I did love Lou's fashion - it kind of reminded me of ""Amélie"" - colorful and corky. I also loved to see Tywin from Game of Thrones and lovely Mr. Bates from ""Downton Abbey."" Hence one extra star."
" An extra ordinary story of loving and living
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,10,"What have I watched!
A drama, I wish it never ended.
I havent read the novel, but watching this I think its one of the films where performance of the characters blow you away whatever the storyline is.
But wait, the story was a masterpiece as well.I'd give an Oscar to Emilia Clarke. And Claffin as well, was left only with facial expressions due to quadriplegia, he nailed it.
Dialogues throughout the film keep you hooked to the screen.An absolute favorite of mine. Watched this on 2016 and again on last night. Like my favorite songs I felt like I can watch this movie many times without getting bored."
" US, AFTER WATCHING THIS
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,1,I watched about half of this film from the middle to the end. I was even more unhappy with this movie after finding out how the story began.The cast are all fine actors but the movie sends out a very dangerous message. Never watched a love story where I felt so uncomfortable. It didn't make me happy or sad - just angry!The movie made lots of money but to what end...there is more out of life than Me Before You!
" A little advice!
",2019-02-11 00:00:00,7,"Really think you should read it before you watch. Think the book and film complement each other really well. Don't think i'd of loved it so much if i'd not read it first. They don't have time in film to do full backstory of everyone, it would end up longer than LOTR, but think id of felt it rushed if not had the knoledge! Together though gorgeous <3"
" I CRIED SO MUCH
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,10,I created a account just to say how much I love this show. It was so emotional and sad and beautiful and I cried a lot. PLEASE DO WATCH
" Incredible!!!!!!!
",2019-02-01 00:00:00,9,"This film is so so beautiful, I love it!!! Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin do the roles so well and they are just as I imagined them to be when I read the book."
" Trash
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,1,Not worth watching no plot at all don't bother watching it's such a waste of time
" It changes your mood definitely
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,8,"I would rate it 10/10 if the ending wasn't like thatI'm sad about him dying at the end
It show you how much life can be hard sometimes it's really meaningful i love it
And the director did really great job shooting the scene with all that nature ughh it was so goodAlso i loved the songs they played it most of them are ed sheeran which is my fav.."
" Emotional Masterpiece
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,10,"After losing her job at a local restaurant, Lou desperately seeks a job in order to support her family. Thus, she accepts to take care of a fully crippled young man who seems to have lost hope in life. Much sooner than expected, her job will be taken to the next level as she gets emotionally involved, but will it actually be enough to make a difference?It's a movie which left a big impression on me and I have to say this from the beginning. Its plot managed through its apparent simplicity to generate so much emotion that I was left breathless many times. It's so dramatic and romantic that it can fill you with you joy but also make your eyes water. It has such unique and charismatic characters that you simply cannot avoid caring for them. Everything they do and feel gets sent straight to you as you were part of the action, thus the emotion it generates is simply breathtaking. It manages to alternate drama, laughter and romance in such a way that I honestly haven't seen since ""The Fault in Our Stars"", another similar movie which I adore. You might find it a bit predictable from time to time, except its finale which is everything but predictable, but I can easily forgive this small flaw after seeing it as a whole.The actors it has are simply marvelous. They are able to impersonate their characters in such a way that they make you believe it's reality. Their charisma plays a very important role here, making themselves likeable and also making everything credible and as a result, more emotional and dramatic. The dialog is another plus as its complexity helps a lot, especially when facing a more difficult situation which simply implies it. Their British accent is also worth mentioning as it brings some sort of flair to this film.I cannot emphasize enough how much I like this movie. Its plot, its characters, its actors and especially its atmosphere are so good, but the way it makes you feel is simply one of a kind. It starts slowly but it builds up pace and ends up in style. You can see by far that these people truly know how to make a movie of this genre and the final result is simply great. It's simply a wonderful achievement!"
" Euthanasia gets the twee treatment
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,3,The most innocuous of mills and boon love stories ends with the romantic co-lead topping himself and expecting his new found love to come and gaily see him off. Everything that's wrong with the world is here. Insulting to people who face pain and anguish with courage and the loving help of partners and family.
" Awesome romantic story
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,10,"I don´t like romantic films but this one inspired me. The film feature Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, who also starred in Games of Thrones. The film was an adaptation of a book written by Jojo Moyes with the exact same name, but i learned about the book after watching the movie.It´s a story about love of a two different people from English countryside. Louisa Clark ( Emilia Clarke) works in a local bistro and dated with Patrick, whom she probably doesn´t love. After losing her job at a local cafe, she got a job in the household of Traynors. She was supposed to be a companion and a caretaker of Will Traynor. Will Traynor (Sam Claflin) is a successful, young man who loved his life, but it quickly changed after a heavy traffic accident. He becomes paralyzed. Will´s mother was desperate, because will got depressed, and she couldn´t do anything on her own, so she tried to find caretakers who would help him and persuade him that life is worth living. After a few months full of crazy activities, they became good friends until love arose.Lou is funny, optimistic, kind and she wears crazy clothes. On the other side, Will´s character changed during the film. At the beginning of this story Will was depressed, cynical, but over time his character grow and he became really funny and sweet yet still calm and mysterious.They were like sun and moon, different, but they were meant to be together. In my opinion, this film is very romantic, funny and dramatic. I really liked it and I recommend it to watch."
" So lovely
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,8,"It is absolutely brilliant movie.I just like the movie,it really taught the value of love,the acting of both the main characters is absolutely stunning.Pls watch it guys ,u would really love it.I am damn sure about that."
" Waste of time
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,1,"I get that the movie was supposed to portray something real and remind us that these things do happen (referring to the ending) but let's face it - the guy was a selfish prick. He had commodities others in similar situations would never have or would have to struggle to get. Not to mention he was surrounded by people who loved him and yet all he could focus on was himself and this vision of him as this grand failure because he's in a wheelchair. Sent out a pretty bad message, in my opinion. He didn't even bother to try a little bit more for his life. You tell me he's in a vegetative state or in this incredible agonizing pain 24/7 okay. I don't like to judge a person's reason for choosing such an option but I think people need to be reminded it's not the solution. This film seemed like it was condoning suicide. It makes you think he made the right decision in choosing himself and that he had that right to not be sad anymore."
" Infuriating
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,5,"This movie was initially promising. I'm cramping it's a cold winter evening and raining outside I want a feel good movie. So I find this and the trailer is quite promising. The scenery and landscape just beautiful. The main character's outfits colourful (I would actually wear all that). She was great her attitude, her personality and positive outlook on everything. Her smile is just stunning, I actually didn't mind the crazy eyebrows lol. I think she's a beautiful girl and she portayed the character in excellent fashion. Not much comment on the other actors, she certainly stood out to me the most because her personality was as colourful as her outfits. It was great to see her bring Will out of his funk.Loved the location too like I said great scenery, the castle was just amazing especially aerial views of it. The whole small town/village feel made me almost want to live there as well despite it seeming constantly cold. It was great.HOWEVER, although it was great to see Will transition from a miserable meh (excuse my lack of better terminology), it was irritating to have him keep referring back to his old life. Everything was better when I had full use of my limbs and I was in Paris seated at a cafe and all the ladies paid attention to me and only me. Now I can't do that and other rich boy activities with my snobby friends (who marry my ex girlfriend) so life can't go on. How dare he then allow this poor young lady to fall in love and make her see in him someone she wants to be with. She was willing to change her life for him and then the nerve of him to tell her to find someone better. YOU ARE THE SOMEONE BETTER DUH and you feel the same way about me. If you claim you are the happiest you've been in a while since meeting me why then must you live me in perpetual anguish of losing someone that didn't have to die but chose to die anyways because his circumstances changed. It's clear his parents would do anything to ensure his happiness and he would have been able to live a full life despite being a paraplegic. Sure there's difficulties and that's understandable, I couldn't imagine having my life change like that. Nevertheless, it doesn't mean that it becomes impossible to live. Clearly in all the acivities he did with her it was possible to live just in an adapted way. But NOOOOOO homeboy was too caught up in his ""James Bond"" past.I was very infuriated at the end of it. ABSOLUTELY INFURIATED and will be forever INFURIATED. A different ending would have easily given his movie excellent reviews from me."
" Average to below
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,5,You watch a movie like this to feel the love.. I didn't feel theblove between that characters.. well I felt it from Emile like a young school girl but never from will. So it lacked because of that. He never loved her because he was too hung up on his old like.. that obviously sucked if his girlfriend ended up with his best friend. I don't know.. for me this movie was a waste of time and quite depressing. Emilie was cute but some parts were cringy . Ie: dance on the beach. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
" Goog one
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,8,It was completely based on the book since I've read it. Emilia perfectly played her role. I enjoyed it.
" great

" Heartbreakingly beautiful
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,9,"Such an amazing love story. Absolutely broke my heart, yet warmed it at the same time.
I heard about this movie years ago, but never got to watch it until now. So glad I did.
Sam Claflin is unbelievably talented. I have seen all of the movies he's been in, and I have to say that his performance in this one i just out of this world.
Emilia Clarke has great facil expressions. I could feel every single emotion her character was feeling just by looking at her face. Wow.
Great movie to watch when you just want to cry your eyes out."
" A Wonderful Movie.
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,7,"A truly loving and endearing feature, with a talented cast in good use and very well meaning intentions.I enjoyed this film, greatly, most upon which lay in the interesting premise and wonderful performances. One immediately points to Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, for their chemistry truly drives this film, and scenes where they are separated have great weight as one can genuinely feel the disconnect and worriment felt by the characters, which is a great achievement on the part of the actors, screenplay and director.The films screenplay is worthy of praise, however is also the root of some of the films flaws. The motion picture is an adaptation a novel, both were written by the same individual (Jojo Moyes). The screenplay builds upon the characters highly successfully in the first two acts of the picture, and delivers the dilemma with clarity and respect.However the third act, I thought to be weaker, for I believe for Will's motives to not have been explored as deeply as could have been, for it was told and not necessarily shown, and what was shown didn't hit the emotive mark as well as it could have. Therefore when he chooses his final choice, and Lou's subsequent decision: it feels a little premature, a bit too out of the blue, the twist isn't as convincing as could have been. Thus this weakens the third act, although by the final scenes between the two is of great emotional impact, and rectifies many of the problems by the narratives end.The supporting cast was of particular importance to how the story unfolded, I felt that some were stronger than others. I felt that Charles Dance and Vanessa Kirby were the most impactful upon the story and delivered as such in their performances. However I felt that Will's mother, played by Janet McTeer could have been stronger and had a greater part to play in the narrative, although the performances from the actress and the aforementioned actors were all splendid.On the other hand, I believe for the doctor called Nathan to be a very telling character to the film, in that he spoke and delivered what he had to say and then left, as a expositionary source. That his impact was minimal and could of had a much more emotive arc and relationship with Will and Lou.However, I must not forget the wonderful use of colour in this film; with particular praise for the costume design and cinematography. The costume designers for this film did a splendid piece of work, in endressing Emilia Clarke in all the happy, striped and multicoloured costumes, without ever coming across as silly, but as loving, friendly and caring. The cinematography further highlighted this interesting colour palette, and helped to compliment it, without the film descending into looking like madness or a fairy world. Apart from that, the angles are clear and fairly standard, but yet deliver upon the dramatic function to a fair and adequate quality, overall the cinematography aids and enhances from the film and doesn't detract from it, as it could have very easily fallen into more silly territory.In the end, I did very much enjoy this film. I particularly liked the performances and the very loving and jolly atmosphere sustained thought the feature, which brings a fun and entertaining film. Though the screenplay at times hindered certain aspects of the film and some characters, it played to great strengths in other areas. Thus I give the film a healthy 7/10. I would recommend this film, particularly to people looking for something romantic or for quiet evenings and slow days."

" Good to watch
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,7,Emilia Clark and her edgy looks makes this movie so cute & fun to watch. I hate the ending tho :(.
" Read the books
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,1,"Omg I was so excited to watch this film, I have loved the books and the Louisa Clark. I was so disappointed by this film. By how quickly it moves and how bloody awful Emilia Clarke is. I love her in game of thrones, who doesn't, but she is so wrong in this part. If you read the 3rd book, the character is so different and only 2 years older. :("
" great example of how to ruin a perfectly good book
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,4,"So Will looks nowhere near a real quad. Two years after the accident, he's still buff, healthy looking and wayyy to happy to be a depressed man who wants to go to Dignitas. They couldn't even bother to make him look less like a marathon man?Clarke is just way too animated and silly most of the time, I'm really bummed out they didn't make more deep characters and challenged the actors. And she's supposed to be poor right? For a part of the book she's the sole provider of both her parents and granddad and she's still walking in really fancy detailed and hard to get outfits. Yes the book points out her colorful clothes, but these film makers appear to have no idea what you'd really look like if you're poor. or maybe they do and they're pressured into never making a chick flick that is realistic! Ugh makes me so pissed! It's like watching Sex and the City where they magically are just wealthy, because who wants to look at poor people?The book delves pretty good into the miserable life of being depressed and paralyzed - but this book doesn't even scratch the surface.It just feels like a money movie - to quickly go over all the events in the book and none of the actual emotion.Urgh I'm so disappointed."
" LOVE/HATE!!!
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,5,"Oh my goodness out of all the movies I've reviewed , this one is the oddest! I started out loving this movie then ended up hating it... Thinking about the movie now there were Parts I loved and parts that I hated! I'm 44 years old I've been on disability since I was 26 years old! I know what it's like to go through disabilities and chronic pain and different situations to where you want to end your life. At one time it was so bad in my early twenties, I did try to in my life. Thank God I did not succeed at it. Even today times are tough but I have a strong support system! I made a pact with my sisters, brother and my son that I would never try to take the easy way out of here again. And there's no way in hell my family, my mother especially would stand and let me say Mom after 6 months... Let me die! No way in hell that's happening. So I tried to watch this movie from everybody's perspective. And I understand why so many gave it at 10, I understand why so many gave it a one down to zero. I gave it a 5 because I like the movie half and half ! The love and caring that others had for this man was beautiful and yes I agree he was most selfish on his end, At the same time, I understand that is his choice and his right. Do I agree with his choice? NO I DO NOT. To me love conquers all. And I also agree it does send a message out ""unintentionally I'm sure"" that if you're disabled, or not as you used to be, your life isn't worth living. That is simply NOT TRUE! If that were the case, I would have been gone a long time ago. If you want to make movies like this, send better messages, especially to young viewers. People that are disabled are discriminated against enough. I even have a special needs son who's 22 and there's no way I will ever tell him he's not equal. There's nothing he can't do! Even if he has to do things different then so be it. Love life, live life! So many people wish they could have and could not. Bless all those who are disabled and feel like they don't want to go on at times. You can go on and you should!! Especially when you have a strong love and support system which the man in this film had!"
" Heartbreaking
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,9,"We loved this movie. I loved the characters, they had chemistry. I hate to be sad and this movie was full of emotion, but it was fantastic."
" What a message!!!!!
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,1,"The last 5 minutes made me hate the whole movie.
The movie before those 5 minutes was a 7 to me, it was querky and kinda refreshing, but no, I can't stand that message, no one ever has the right to end his life no matter how hard he live, this movie should have give people hope, what a message for people with disabilities, they have every right to live.
i wish he lived happilly ever after with Lou, or died naturelly by complications. ""or mayby died in that accident in the first place and not making that book""
I was in the middle of reading the book. I wanted to read the book before watching the movie, but thanks God I watched the movie first, cause I really disappointed with the story it is all wrong in every aspects. the problem is you can't find out until the end.How do you describe this as romantic,and how all this compliments and rating for the movie and the novel.DISAPPOINTING"
" Beautifully crafted, thoroughly engaging
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,9,"I love a story that doesn't pretend to be a documentary, that says what it has to say in a straightforward manner but with considerations of the heart leading with every step. The scenarios and outcomes it depicts are realistic - not that they would play out in the same way in ordinary life, where the details of daily life are far more pressing than they can ever be in fiction. I am often turned off many recent movies as they are trying to depict real situations in convincing ways which really only relate to the screenwriter's manner of being convinced, or else movies are so far into the liberty of fiction you end up in animated special-effect nonsense land, whether it be the acting, the script or the sheer visuals.Love conquers death. This is a movie of hope. The hope is not a laundered hope, and that contrasts wonderfully with this well laundered film.I would have given it 10 stars but there was a little punch or something missing to it. I'll probably find it in the next viewing."
" Deeply dissatisfied
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,1,"Sucks donkey dong. The main girl only likes fashion and has the personality of one of the bricks on my fireplace. In fact, I would rather hold a conversation with one of the bricks on my fireplace than with her. Also, they insinuate being paralyzed is so awful that Will decides to off himself. Life can still be enjoyed for other reasons. But I would have offed myself too if I were him getting stuck with that bumblebee tights freak. Loser mcpoopy pants. Whatevs. I forced myself to finish the stupid movie and then sat and reflected on how deeply disappointed I was that I wasted my few hours of free time not at work or doing errands on that piece of rat crap movie."
" Gets me crying Everytime
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,9,"Cried the first time I watched it. Now it's the 6th time I've seen it ,and I noticed that the more times I watch it, the earlier into the film I cry. Lou's character is so beautiful and so is their relationship, which makes me cry because I know how it ends.Would recommend if you want a good cry, and if you're a fan of Emilia Clarke. She's so cute in this."
" Coming from somebody who hasn't read the book.
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,6,"Let me start by saying this movie was good enough that it made me want to read the book. I don't think this movie would have been good if it didn't have the lovely Sam Claflin. His character saved the movie for me, relatable and loveable. He is an excellent actor and played his role equally well. The overall British theme of the movie was brilliant, I loved it. I like Emilia Clarke, but the character she portrays wasn't my favourite, just my opinion.
Louisa Clark seemed joyful, kind, extroverted, optimistic, and William was the opposite. He was sarcastic, dark and pessimistic. Opposites attract, but I am a person very like Will, and I would not fall for somebody like Lou. Again, that's just me. I love the couple. A few lines in this movie really made me laugh, for example:
Lou: 'I don't like superiority.' 
Will: 'You must hate me, then.'
The movie was enjoyable and kept me watching it, however, it was definitely predictable. I think everybody who has watched these kind of movies before can agree with me. I knew what the ending was going to be before I watched it. I definitely preferred the second half of the movie than the first, the comedic aspect quickly dropped. It was heartwarming and very sweet. It shows love is worth fighting for but some people cannot, or don't want to be, saved. I liked that. Some people are so sure of what they want, that nothing can change their minds. A nice movie."
" Decent
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,7,"Sorry for my bad english
I think it's a nice movie. Personally i didn't expect much and while watching it i didn't thought they are promoting any kind of wrong message about disability maybe because I've seen Will's character as a person and not as a disable man. For me there are two diffrent personalities ""trappted"" in situations they don't want to and somehow they help each other to free themself. On one hand we have Will a guy who was always strong, confident, rich and handsome and because of these characteristics he refuses to accept his accident. By taking this decission he was able to have the control of his own life and get back his dignite. On the other hand we have Lou a nice, sweet and dreamy but timid girl who never refuses anything, who stays in a relasionship knowing that they have nothing in common, who always helps even if she has to set her dreams aside.Through their connection, she gave him the love and care that he might never had, so he left in peace and complete and he pushed her, as she is health and able, to chase her dreams and put herself first.
The movie is more about the feelings of the persons, the way they want to see themselves(she dresses in crazy outfits/ he cares more about his image to the world), the dreams they have( he had many but he's unable now/ she had few but she is scared) and how they accept whatever life brings.
To tell the truth if the end was different, it would have been very obvious, so love and money can't always bring the happiness the way we expect it."
" Totally misleading and giving really bad advices for the world.
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,1,What kind of a joke does louisa do with patrick and will? That is kind of a b*tch move. I am totally dissappointed. She already had patrick as her boyfriend. She refused to be a part of his life but a part of will's life. I know patrick doesn't know lou's favors but the reason she ditched patrick is ridiculous. 😏

Great story, Great Acting, Just a Perfect Movie.."
" Lessons in Love
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,9,"Me Before You is a film full of emotion. Through this film, Thea Sharrock shows us that life does not always go as we want, but it must be lived fully, make the most of. The fact that Will still decides to end his life despite all Louisa's efforts to restore a taste for life, shows that even love can not change the way we see things because deep down he knew that nothing would change. But because he loved her, he changed Louisa's life so that she could live it as she pleased. Love takes many forms and even paralyzed or dead we can continue to bring happiness to those we love. So yes, I really loved this movie."

" Tear-jerker

You want to relieve the experience over and over again as sad as it is. Cant watch it without the tissues. There is one other love story very similar to this that I found as beautiful which was ""Dying Young"" (Julia Roberts and Campbell Scott). This is definitely a must see."
" It's really one of those movies which touches your soul
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,10,"I knew Emilia Clarke from Game of thrones doing like serious acting but when I saw her she was like most adorable thing.
If you love feel good movies then you will really love this one because it makes you feel happy by seeing them together and it makes you cry by not ending up with each other.
A great movie to watch and just see what love is !!"
" Truth
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,7,The whole plot of the movie got some sense so i can't say it's a bar movie but the of Patrik was really upsetting. If i was Patrik i would have done the same. If you love someone you make expectations from them. So I'm sorry about him.
" $50,000 worth of Clothes ???
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,4,"To me, a Huge Glaring Flaw in the movie concerned the Main Character's Wardrobe.
She specifically stated that she needed the money for the job.
Her father was Not a rich man.
Yet, in every scene, she wore a totally different outfit.
Her fashionable outfits and boots and even her $200 umbrella didn't fit.Where did she get $50,000 for all those clothes and accessories?I really don't like movies that have this big of a Disconnect.
It's really an insult to the viewer."
" Best romantic movie so far...
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,10,"Basically I didn't like to watch romantic movie. But when I listened to the soundtrack of this movie, I got an view that this movie kinda looks not that bad or different from the other romantic movie. Yeah it's right and the end of the movie is leaving me a shocked like not what I thought in my head HE COMMITTED SUICIDE !!! And it's the first movie that made me cry for the romance genre."
" Appealing characters with a rank bromide of an ending
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,3,"I found the characters and the acting appealing, but was appalled by the ending. The American and modern mindset of ""I'll do it my way or I won't do it all"" ends up being a self pitying bromide, that trivializes the real courage demanded to live any life at all, let alone the life of someone with quadriplegia. I personally am ambulatory, but I have worked more than 30 years with special needs individuals of all ages, shapes, and sizes. There is not one of them that I would have said, ""Gee,I think the world would've been way better without you"". We are faced daily with things we do not want in our lives. Please understand that I am not comparing breaking a shoelace or dropping my favorite teapot with an accident that leads one never to be independent in one's own care again. But no one is better off without these lives, unless you view life as important only when it is convenient and painless, which any fool can see is pretty rare. I am also not attacking those who decide, for whatever reasons, to end their own lives. But make no mistake, it is not dignified, it is not better. We are given the gift to live our lives, whatever lives we have been given. The protagonist got one thing absolutely right: we have one life. One. There is only one of each of us. One. With those odds, one out of billions, may each of us offer ourselves for others for the entire time we have been given."
" Dont watch the movie if you have read the novel
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,5,"It's disappointing to watch this movie rush towards the end. It failed to capture the essence of novel, the energy and the situational seriousness. Louisa's character is made more of a joke, she is shown only as a laughing and smiling idiot, which is not the case in the novel. The acting is forced and it looks as if someone has made a summarised recap of complete package. Screenplay is the only part that justifies itself other then that, everything is just rushed to the finishing line. Its not actors, but the director who ruined the movie.
I am not sure if Jojo actually was happy to see this kinda potrayal of her beautiful written/drafted novel."
" Just superb
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,10,"Firstly, I read the book, an amazing book which made me feel lots of things: happiness, love and, mostly, sadness. Secondly I watched the movie, marvellous movie, with superb actors. I cried when they were crying, I laughed when they were laughing. Everyone should watch it, just for understanding how much someone can love a person."

",2018-08-14 00:00:00,1,"The disability shown by this ego centric man doesn't seem to effective him being a prick. He just has a small accident, yes he cannot walk but thats not grounds for suicide. Especially when you are mega rich and have the support of parents and a girlfriend. Sam Claflin, only playing a disabled guy to attract the ladies. Yet the only girl he can get is his carer, who has an odd personality to make munters think they can get a fit guy."
" Euthanasia advertisement film
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,1,"I thought it will be beautiful romantic movie that glorifies life, but at the end, euthanasia happens. Beautiful, romantic euthanasia in Switzerland (cynically)
I wrote this from my point of view; I spent 9 months helping people with tetra and paraplegia, people that embrace life."
" Only OK
",2018-08-07 00:00:00,5,"Movie was OK. There was nothing unexpected from this fairly standard plot. And although I didn't necessarily dislike Emilia Clarke in her role, her facial expressions were way too exaggerated. I mean, what's with the incessant eyebrow raising? It was actually distracting!
But good acting and casting in general. And beautiful scenery shots."
" mind blowing

" Skip the movie and read the book.
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,1,"Not to sound cliche but the book is so much better than the movie. 
I've read the book twice; year's apart and I loved the emotion that it brought out in me both times. The first time reading it, I hated Will Traynor at the end because I thought he was some selfish prick who was accustomed to getting his way and couldn't see the beauty amongst the ugly. The second time reading it, I empathized with Will Traynor and realized I was being the selfish one.
The book makes you confront the right to die decision from the perspective of many characters and you feel for each one. I cried, laughed, felt anger and many other emotions. In my opinion that's a sign of a great book.Too bad the movie didn't bring out the same emotions. The storyline was flat, the characters boring; with the actress playing Louisa Clark being downright annoying. It was as if she was forcing herself to be Lou Clark. Trust me, the Louisa Clark in the book isn't so cheesy. 
Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke also had no onscreen chemistry so you never get to feel the depths of how their relationship develops.
The movie also leaves out details from the book that are important for both the character(s) and story and adds scenes that are completely unnecessary.
In the book Louisa Clarks family isn't so cheery about their financial woes which is one reason why we see Louisa Clark not stray far from home so she can financially help her family. Another reason being the ""maze incident"", a scene the movie left out. To wrap it up, if you want to really get the meaning of the book and a more in depth feel of the characters skip the movie and read the book."
" Twisted message
",2018-07-17 00:00:00,5,"As other reviewers have said, the message in the end is that even with love and money, one rich a-hole cannot bear the thought of living bc he is physically disabled. So dumb it had me laughing in the end just how dumb the idea is. Dumb and offensive to all disabled! I gave it a five star bc you should watch it just to see how insane it is. And bc I do like Emilia C."
" Me Before You
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,8,"This movie is beautifully heartbreaking - with amazing performances by the quirky Emilia Clark and the devilishly handsome Sam Claflin and a soundtrack that fully represents the real love and pain of an amazing couple. This movie is one of those that you'll watch over and over and cry about for days.The entire cast and directors deserve a huge round of applause for the emotional story they put to screen and you'll fall in love with this amazing romance over and over again. 
And yes, the ending will leave you breathless."
" Amazing film
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,9,"In any love movie, there has to be a tragic event happen but soon be resolved by the ""prince"" or man of the entire story. In many cases, romantic films have someone who is disabled and ends up falling in love with someone. The protagonist tragically has to tell their partner the challenges they have to face and they resolve the problem and live happily ever after. Me Before You is definitely a movie to rewatch because each character has significant traits that compliment the rest of the movie, shifting perspectives and giving a jaw- dropping finish.
 Director Thea Sharrock does a phenomenal job in making the personalities of each character very realistic and believable. A cheerful town girl named Louisa Clarke, got fired from her job at a cafe near her home that she has worked at for 6 years and is in desperate need of employment. She then finds the job of caregiving for a 35 year old disabled man and decides to take the opportunity hoping to get the job. Louisa is very happy and outgoing with a very strange sense of style while Will is the complete opposite. When Louisa was introduced to Will, he had already started with a bad impression and gave Louisa a bad vibe making her job difficult. Will, being disabled, has the stereotype that people in wheelchairs are weak and sweet people, considering that they have experienced such a terrible accident. However, Will comes off as rude and offensive, not caring about where his life is going. Louisa has the stereotype that she's calm and nice because she is the caregiver and he is disabled. However, she is very honest and blunt with him which he respects considering that everyone treats him like a baby and is unable to think for himself. For example, she was fixing some frames he had destroyed after he was invited to his ex girlfriend's wedding and he insults her while doing so resulting in her telling him that she does not deserve the treatment everyone else is receiving because she is only trying to do her job as best she can. It is very obviously to see how two completely different personalities collide and how the stereotypes of these certain people are quickly flipped and you get a sense of reality. She changes the idea of these two personalities and makes it seem like something like this would really occur in real life and it is one of the biggest factor in any movie. Viewers always look for how realistic the movie is and if it makes sense and Sharrock did just that. 
 Sharrock gears the attention towards the disabled man with his point of view to really see how people like him feel about themselves and what they have to go through everyday. Throughout the movie you see how Will feels embarrassed about his situation considering that he needs extra help from other people. Will Traynor had an amazing life before the accident. He was a businessman with many interests in sports, a very active man. Once the road accident occurred, he became his own worst nightmare. He hated himself every minute. When Louisa would want to do something with him, he makes ""suggestions"" which is really just sarcasm because he wants to be left alone and unbothered. Sharrock really shows how frustrated he gets with himself and it's what ties the audience in. You never see how a disabled person can feel about their lives when no matter how happy or fun your life is for some moment, you still go on every single day hating it. 
 One of the biggest make or break moments in any movie is how it ends and in this film it is done exceptionally well. When Louisa finds out that Will is planning to end his life in 6 months, she makes a plan to try and change his mind by showing him how his life can be with her. She takes him on a trip and they do many activities together building a romantic relationship. As the trips show how happy they were together you would think that he would change his mind and stay with Louisa because she has clearly shown that she will do anything to be with him no matter the circumstance. However, the last night at their romantic getaway, she admits that she knew about Dignitas, a society that provides assisted suicide, and how his parents only had six months. She begins to talk about how she can make his life better and show him what a great life looks like even if he's paralyzed. The saddening truth was that he knew no matter who it was, no one was going to change his mind. His mind was set and there was no going back. He knew that no matter what came in his way, they would never have to go through what he goes through and never understand what it's like to be in a wheelchair paralyzed from the neck down. 
 The ending is the sprinkles to the cake. The way the personality traits are set up, Will makes us believe he is having a great time with her on the trips Louisa plans, and soon coming down to keeping his decision the same before and after all the fun had occurred. It all ties together perfectly because in the perspective of a disabled man, you see how he truly feels and everyday he feels like a burden and doesn't want anyone else doing anything for him making it difficult on everyone. The ending wasn't a typical ""happily ever after"" or a ""he fell in love and knows that he can be happy again."" Sharrock ends with a completely different twist that will leave you with tears running down your face."
" Nothing like the book
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,4,"I read this book and became my instant favorite. I don't think like others do that encouraged or mystifies euthanasia. I think it makes you aware of what some people chooses. Right or wrong? Their choose. Not my personal one though. Now, the movie lacked of that insight given by the book but had scenes in the wrong order. She never went to live with Patrick. We never knew she was going back to school. We never saw Will's sister and his dad's mistress. The movie moved so quick that didn't give you time to fully understand the process of falling for each other and such. I'm mad after watching the movie. Emilia Clark did a great job except for her excessive facial expressions. It became upsetting."
" Great Film.
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,9,"A flawless movie. Honest. Touching. Beautifully photographed at picturesque locations. Warm, tender performances from a stellar cast. Excellent writing with dialogue that flows effortlessly. A perfect balance of gentle wit, romance, and emotion, without ever being heavy-handed. Really there's nothing about this film that could have been done any better. I found it charming and captivating from beginning to end."
" A nice dramatic movie
",2018-07-06 00:00:00,8,"This movie is typical for those who like soft romantic movies with a new ending, I enjoyed watching it and i liked how the characters had really strong emotions and opinions, it's simple and that type of movie you'll try to hold your tears from falling while watching it, i did expect more of the story but as a whole it was lovely"
" Nothing to say!
",2018-06-21 00:00:00,8,"This is a a movie, mixture of happiness, joy & end with sadness.
i didnt expect its ending this way. Bit sad, but a complete enjoyable romantic movie :)"
" Brilliant Must See!!
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,10,"Emilia Clarke is magic on the scene and her chemistry with Sam Clafin is undeniable. From the moment you see Emilia in the tea house to the last moments in Paris it is an amazing performance. Her quircky ways and sparkling eyes keep you mesmerized. What a talent! The story centers on a girl who takes a job as a care taker to a man who has been paralyzed from the neck down. The journey of the relationship from strangers to people in love is amazing. You laugh. You cry. Some people may call this a ""Chick Flick"" but I just call it great cinema! It is a must see for anyone who just wants a great movie. I have watched it over and over. 2 thumbs up and 10 stars in my book!"
" Wow
",2018-06-14 00:00:00,10,"Simply amazing, words cannot describe how great this film is. Such a good story line! Sad to think that things like this happen in our world."
" An amazing love story
",2018-06-14 00:00:00,8,I had never read the book that this film is based on. And yet it seems I should read the book now.
" Truly disappointed
",2018-06-11 00:00:00,1,Instead of courage and strength in the face of adversity this movie displays weakness and cowardliness. Was glad for the voice of reason the mother gave towards the end. Euthanasia truly is nothing short of murder. Very upsetting the movie makes light of this terrible and selfish act portraying it to be the best thing. Wow how far we have come to applaud choosing death over life. It seems the main agenda here in this flick is to desensitize the audience into thinking we should just idly sit by and watch our loved ones kill themselves. If he had used a gun would they have held his hand as well? Sickening!
" A difficult subject handled well
",2018-05-30 00:00:00,8,"Who would have thought there were so many laughs in a tale of someone paralysed from the neck down? Emilia (Game Of Thrones) Clarke encounters Sam (Hunger Games) Claflin while involved with Matthew (Harry Potter) Lewis in a film which has nothing to do with any of those fantasy franchises!Lou is a tea shop waitress in a small rural English town. On losing her job she applies to become a carer for Will Traynor, paralysed in an accident. She doesn't realise what a moody unpleasant person he is, nor does she realise he is determined to commit assisted suicide at Dignitas in Switzerland. But as feelings start to grow between them, despite their intentions, could it be that Will might change his mind?To be frank, this isn't my sort of film, a feeling which was reinforced within the first 10 minutes as Lou turned out to be unbearably cute, endlessly compassionate towards the quirky old lady patrons of the cafe, possessed of an apparently massive wardrobe of unbelievably eccentric clothing and, to cap it all, convinced that all problems could be solved with a Nice Cup Of Tea. She was a character drawn from the Wacky And Loveable Young Thing box of clichés.And Sam Claflin's immobile moody young man was more credible, but no different in essence: Mr Rochester on wheels.But the two of them turned out to have decent chemistry, and the film turned out to have far more laughs than I expected, so I stuck with it. And I'm glad I did. It used humour to soften the edges of what, in many ways, was a very brutal story. Despite the late Christopher Reeve's sterling efforts in support of stem cell research, there is still currently no coming back from catastrophic spinal cord injuries, something which Lou does not initially realise, and something which lies at the heart of the once athletic Will's decision.Whether the burgeoning love between Will and Lou will be sufficient to overrule his decision is the dramatic focus of the story, and I would not want to spoiler the ending. But I will say that the circumstances and issues of quadriplegia and assisted suicide are presented unflinchingly, and without any moral judgement in either direction.This is an easier, more accessible film than Whose Life Is It Anyway?, the only other film I'm aware of which addresses this issue, but it doesn't draw conclusions any more easily than that film did.After being a bit queasily saccharine to start off with, Emilia Clarke settles in to the role, and both she and Claflin provide an effective emotional heart to the film: Janet McTeer and Charles Dance as Will's parents are also touching. The main location (Pembroke Castle) is gorgeous, and Clarke's wardrobe is (deliberately) awful. There was only one wrong note: I felt mild annoyance at the Traynor family's wealth. The ability to load Will onto a private jet and fly off to the Caribbean added a glib tone which I would have preferred to have been absent. The very end of the film fell into this category, too.Overall, though, this addressed a difficult subject in an entertaining and credible way."
" Total waste of time
",2018-05-24 00:00:00,2,This film literally just legitimizes euthanasia and is a complete waste of time. One hundred percent predictable plot. No reason to watch.
" Adorable Dramatic Romance
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,8,"The twenty-six year-old waitress of a cafe Louisa ""Lou"" Clark (Emilia Clarke) is a charming woman that lives with her parents Bernard (Brendan Coyle) and Josie Clark (Samantha Spiro), her sister Katrina ""Treena"" Clark (Jenna Coleman) and her grandfather (Alan Breck) in a small town in the United Kingdom. Lou supports the whole family since Bernard is unemployed and Treena is a student. When she loses her job, she applies to the position of caregiver of the wealthy banker Will Traynor (Sam Claflin), who was hit by a motorcycle two years ago and became tetraplegic. Will´s mother Camilla Traynor (Janet McTeer), supported by her husband Stephen Traynor (Charles Dance), hires the unexperienced but happy Lou to take care of her son together with his nurse Nathan (Stephen Peacocke). When Lou meets Will, she finds a bitter, cynical and depressed young man that had lost the will to live. Further, she learns that the handsome Will was a successful athlete and banker. Will she lift his spirit? ""Me Before You"" is an adorable dramatic romance in the directorial debut of director Thea Sharrock. The central subject, euthanasia, is not discussed but it is easy to understand Will´s attitude based on his athletic and sexual performances before the accident. The chemistry of Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin and the beautiful locations in the United Kingdom are enough to grant a wonderful entertainment. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Como Eu Era Antes de Você"" (""How I Was Before You"")"
" Brilliant!
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,10,"This movie was heart touching, sad, and absolutely lovely all at the same time! It tells the story of a beautiful romance and a blossoming love. This movie has and will be in my heart. It has reached out to me to put others first before pleasuring yourself. Wonderful movie! The storyline is absolutely brilliant and amazing!"
" A must see for true romance
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,10,"I usually stray away from romances with seemingly heartbreaking endings but after watching Me Before You i was washed over with so many emotions. SPOILER ALERT. When Will decided to die it broke my heart i cried for 5 straight minutes because my hopelessly romantic heart couldn't take it but after seeing Lou seemingly happy in Paris i realized Will left to escape his pain and regardless they still fell in love and cherished their time together. This really is a must see they may not end up married but they still loved each other till Will's end. After i stopped crying i was happy and content with the ending. The movie has wonderful actors, an amazing script, comedy, and romance, everything a movie with such emotions needs. Please check it out it's worth the watch."
" Must watch
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,9,"One of the movies you can't get over after one watch.Portrayed in the best possible way this story could be.You get every reason to judge Will for being a meek to opt for euthanasia instead of accepting the way his life was, but a lot more reasons not to, for this was not the life he planned .But he made sure he made Clark's life a better one. And through this he lived though he died at the end."
" Not impressive as other love hits ..
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,5,"First thing i should emphasize is , when you compare this film with Walk to Remember Me Before you really not up to catch that caliber.Film fails to attach the viewer emotionally during the play time. Story is distant from the viewer hence there will be no solid connection built between the film and the viewer. Story line is almost predictable , but so as Walk to Remember. But this story fails to add those tiny little spicy things to the story which will really really hurt the viewer at the end. Film ends but viewer will feel alright that he(Will) died but at any stage they did not want him to die. Director should create those small small moments which makes the viewer in tears when the character dies. Acting is not good. Its average from both Loise and Will as well, It may have cost the luxury of a good chemistry between them as well."
" Not so cliche after all
",2018-01-19 00:00:00,7,"There were a series of romantic stories where I came from called three-room dramas, i.e. storylines following living, bedroom and dinning rooms. So I intentionally avoid watching such movies. However, this one stroked different tunes. I am not against it and actually enjoy it.It is a Cinderella story which undoubtedly inhabits minds of young girls since the dawn of civilization but in a unconventional way. It typically starts with the wealthy, handsome young male meeting with a simple-minded, fairly good looking struggling female coincidentally. Of course, this white knight with shinning armors had to rescue the supposing Cinderella eventually. This one is no difference. Nevertheless, this white knight was not with her physically but spiritually in the end. Also, Cinderella indeed tried to rescue him instead but failed to prevail. The writer did so unorthodoxly instead the version of them getting married and living happily ever after which might be preferred by some audience. In my opinion, it indeed kept the integrity of Cinderella story cleverly . The white knight even in the wheel chair in this movie had to rescue the girl. That is the essence of Cinderella tale. It's a warm and enjoyable movie. It also slightly touched the base of assistance suicide. I am not totally on board with it. However, we all can put some thought into it."
" 8 stars for the book and 6 for the movie
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,6,"'Me before you' based on the great female author book, Jojo Moyes, has impacted millions of viewers worldwide. Directed by Thea Sharrock as her forth work after 'Call the Midwife', one can call the movie 'a pinch of Moyes's book'. There are numerous fascinating facts about this movie that we can point to such as: the professional author, performing cast and decoration and costume design and etc, however, it let down many readers as they expected a masterpiece. There were numerous deletions in the movie which can lead to misunderstandings and wrong judgements. For instance, while one is reading the book, s/he is constantly bothered by the way Patrick treats Lou. Many book sections are removed which was dedicated to the Pat and Lou's relationship which let the reader sympathize with Lou and give her the full right to break up, however, in the movie, Lou just breaks up with Pat to be with Will. That was absolutely not fair. Plus, Georgina, Will's sister is removed with traces. Not only the deletion is irritating, but also the whole picture of a depressed quadriplegic rich kid, falling in love with a poor lively girl is a teenage drama. The question is what if Will was poor?! Did the whole thing happened at all?! Now that Will has decided to end his life, does Lou help any other person with this condition just for the sake of it?! The hero and the heroine of the both film and the book lacked glorifying characteristics despite the director and authors attempts to show them unique. Although, Lou and Will were no supposed to be the role model of the world, they could broaden their horizons apart from their own small self. 
The traces of Moyes emotional style of writing can be vividly observed in the movie specially the way, awesome Ellie Clarke appears as Lou and handsome Sam Claflin as Will. While book is unable to present its readers with live images, movie makes it a piece of cake. The use of colors in the movie transmits the full sense of emotion which is provoked while reading the book. Lou's house is full of emotions, life and color while the Traynor's house is just a cold building which is later brighten up by Lou. The great costumes also represent Lou only through vision. However, no one can deny the fact that an author, in comparison to a director, has more time to elaborate on the story and break the limits and this justifies the claim that a film is weaker than a book despite the fact that technology is making it easy day by day to produce noble films."
" I understood the ""me before you"" till its end.
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,9,"Very underrated piece of art! Right at the beginning, one thinks is another stupid and cheesy love story buy thank God I kept on watching!You would expect from this movie to have one of those repeated and cheesy love ending, and it's certainly one of those but not in how one would call a ""standard"" one. What I rescue from this whole movie is how love can be felt and experience differently for all of us and respect for our one decisions is an expression of the deepest sign of love, which is respect. You really have to watch this movie!"
" Sacrifice and love
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,8,"""Me before you"" is a 2016 romantic drama movie adapted from the bestselling novel by Jo Jo Moyes . It is set in the UK and shot in various historic locations such as Pembroke Castle in Wales, and Chenies Manor House in Buckinghamshire, England. This movie is filled with amazing actors who truly make the film . Both Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin gave a legendary performance in this film and it was absolutely wonderful . I find that the casting for this movie is truly perfect, and the actors do not disappoint.
Me Before You tells the story of Lou , a resourceful, cheerful girl who has been wasting her potential in her small hometown because she feels responsible for taking care of her mother (Josie), her father (Bernard), and her sister, Treena. She is also stuck in a long-term relationship with her fitness-obsessed boyfriend Patrick . Lou takes a needed job working for Will Traynor, who is wheelchair-bound after an accident. Will has always lived a huge lifbig full of adventures , big deals, extreme sports, worldwide travel and now he's pretty sure he cannot live the way he is. 
Will is so moody and bossy . He seems bitter. With time, however, he slowly warms up to Lou, and their relationship grows closer and closer. That is, until Lou learns the truth about why she was hired: after a previous suicide attempt, Will made his mother promise to take him to an assisted suicide facility in six months to end his life. Lou's job has actually been to make sure he doesn't hurt himself before then. Our protagonist refuses to treat him like a kid , and soon his happiness means more to her than she expected so she decided to take him in a serie of discoveries . On the final night of the vacation, Lou declares her love for him, saying that she knows about his plan but wants him to be with her. Although he loves her, too, Will says that he's going through with it. Furious, Lou ignores Will when they return home.
Eventually, Lou relents and decides to share Will's final moments with him the assisted suicide facility. Before his death, Will writes Lou a letter that specifically requests that it only be opened while Lou is in a Paris café. So she goes. The letter says that Will has left Lou a small amount of money so she can go back to school and follow her dreams. It also expresses Will's sadness at causing her pain . Lou begins a new chapter in her life.Overall, this is a great movie with a mix of a ton of laughs and a love story all rolled into one.If you're looking for a good love and sacrifice story , this is undoubtedly the movie for you."

",2017-12-17 00:00:00,1,"Ok, so this movie started out pretty good. I thought it was going to be the typical boy meets girl and falls in love story with a twist of the paralysis thrown in. NEVER did I think it would end the way it did! Awful!! Spoiled rich party boy winds up in a wheelchair and can't accept that his life will never be what it once was. So he selfishly ends his ""pain and suffering"" by assisted suicide, thereby transferring his pain on those who love him for the rest of their lives? What a terrible message to send to anyone facing trials of life! AWFUL!"

",2017-10-25 00:00:00,10,"I recently saw 《Me before you》by Thea Sharrock is a romantic drama film which was produced by New line Cinema/Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer/Sunswept Entertainment,and lasted 110 minutes. This movie is set in 2016 in the US.It tells the story of Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin,played by Steve Peacocke/Jenna Coleman/Janet Mcteer/Charles Dance/Mathew Lewis/Emilia Clarke/Sam Claflin.The Story begins of Will Traynor, an energetic young man from the U.K. Will is a man who lives to the extreme, going off to exotic places, climbing Mounts. However, one day he suffered an accident when a motorcycle hits him before he got into a taxi. The accident left him quadriplegic; for two years, Will had to endure countless doctors appointments and suffers from constant pain. The accident cost him his girlfriend, his home (since it was not wheelchair accessible), and his old life. Tired of the pain he's going through, Will tells his parents that he would like an appointment with a doctor in Switzerland that would ensure the end of his pain. At first their parents are horrified and against the decision their son has decided on, but when he decides to take his own life, they ultimately agreed, if he gave them six more months. He accepted. Later, his mother hires a second caregiver to take care of Will when their primary caregiver is unavailable. Louisa Clark, a recently unemployed twenty-six-year old interviews for this job. Louisa had no experience in the care giving field, but she is a pleasant quirky human being and Camilla Traynor hopes that she would change Will's mind.Louisa was never informed that her job was to make sure that Will didn't kill himself, but she finds out after overhearing a conversation. She was devastated and decided to quit her job, but Camilla begs Louisa to return. She accepts on the one condition that if she's going to change Will's mind that it would affect his own health. Louisa later began thinking of ways to help Will have a great life in the world considering that he's a quadriplegic. She began by taking Will off on short outings and they also went on vacation to Mauritius. During their vacation, Louisa confessed that she was in love with Will and that they could have a life together. He said no and he assured her that he wasn't changing his mind about visiting the doctor in Switzerland. Devistated, Louisa left Will by himself on the beach. Louisa went back home and spent days locked in her room, days later she decides to go to Switzerland before Will kills himself. There Will tells Louisa that the past six months were the best in his life, but it wouldn't change his mind. Louisa kisses him and later Will Traynor is dead. Sometime later, Louisa sits at a table in Paris, where she reads a letter from her sister and then she holds on a letter written by Will. The letter had instructions that she had to visit a Parfumeur and that he left her some money in which she could use to make her life better. He hopes that she lives well; Louisa cries and gets up to fulfill Will's final wish. I Personally think it's very poignant film and very good casting . I Would recommend it because the acting is fascinating"

" My basic view of the film and its critics.
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,9,"I'm so glad that I was able to finally watch this lovely film. I've seen some rather harsh critiques however this film came along at the right time. With all the glare and harshness going on in the outside world, it's nice to escape into someone else's world. I remember listening to my grandparents tell about going to Grand movie theaters during the Depression as an escape from the everyday. There's a true compassion in this film and it seems to have been done with the lot of love. As for the issue of the film allegedly condoning assisted suicides because of the perceived burden is just a bunch of moose caca! I've been a caregiver for many years and whatever Faith or moral View one has, we all have to accept that it is the choice of the person and ferfuxssake give them dignity! Make judgments when you find yourself in that position and not until. People need to stop sharing what they feel and take action upon what they think."
" Definitely a worthwhile film
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,9,"This is a jolly, refreshingly delightful movie. The British do this sort of thing very well indeed. Miss Clarke reminds me a great deal of Audrey Hepburn in many ways—incredibly engaging. I highly recommend this movie—what a wonderful departure from the usual Hollywood fare. Cheers!"
" Wow, how different from Game of Thrones!
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,8,"Emilia Clarke is cute and totally lovable in this film, portraying a quirky character who is all heart. And I can understand why girls might swoon over Sam Claflin, even when (SPOILER ALERTS) wheelchair bound.Despite the tragic background, this is a delightful film that, while raising very serious issues, focuses on the personalities and how they interact. The result is often very funny, but also very moving.Consequently, I am saddened by the reaction of some people, but it also helps me to understand the Trumpist backlash against the 'thought police' in American society. Because unfortunately there are some people who are not content to allow others to watch a film and form their own opinions about the issues portrayed. They want to tell them how to feel and how to think and it is heretical if the film allows the viewers to come to conclusions that may differ from their own. If the film does not specifically embrace their own views and values then they will try to harm it at the box office by driving people away through their rabid criticism.Fortunately, this film is way above that putrid level and can be enjoyed both as entertainment (comedy, drama & romance) and for the meaningful questions about life that it raises. I found it comparable to ""Whose Life Is It Anyway"" and even better than ""The Intouchables""."
" Worth a Watch
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,7,"I definitely consider this movie part of the chic flick genre which I usually avoid, but I could not stop myself from watching Emilia Clarke. It was so refreshing to see her doing something besides the mother of dragons. Don't get me wrong -- I love the Khaleesi as much as every other strong woman and Game of Thrones fan, but in this movie, I found her personality, likability and sometimes playful quirkiness delightful. It was mesmerizing and enough to make me glad I had watched the movie. Of course Sam Claflin is brilliantly handsome so there was no hardship there, either.I found the movie somewhat reminiscent of The Fault in our Stars but without the waterworks that movie elicited. I would have preferred a different ending, but we don't always get what we want. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie with a boyfriend but if you have a free night or want a slow night with a gal pal and a glass of wine, this movie might be worth a watch."
" Just read the book
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,2,"I watched this movie the day after I finished reading the book and was heartbroken by how shallow the movie was. Obviously no movie will be able to contain all of the detail a book can, but ""Me Before You"" was lacking most of the gravitas that emanated from the book's pages. I have no idea how anyone who watched the movie without having read the book had any idea what was happening, because it jumps from idea to idea without segues or explanations and I had to fill in most of the information from what I had read. I love Emilia Clarke in Game of Thrones but goodness she was ill-fit for this role. The Lou of the book evolved from a quirky, shy, small-town girl to a young lady who surprised herself by falling in love with her employer and working up the courage to try a myriad of new things, with his encouragement and help. The Lou of the movie is trite and goofy. Since Emilia seems completely unable to express any emotion except exhilaration, I spent the majority of the movie cringing at the cheesiness of her acting (especially when crying was involved). The ending, which was supposed to tug at our heartstrings and leave us emotional and sentimental, was completely ruined by Emilia's performance.Nathan's character and Will's father's character, for me, stole the show; they were the only actors who really convinced me of anything.Do yourself a favor and read the book -- skip the movie."
" A Dishonest Movie
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,5,"Right away I felt something was off about this film. It had the actors, the acting, and the idea, and I couldn't quite describe why I felt this way. I was never sure where the film was leading me and couldn't understand the characters or their motivations. Overall it felt very confusing, that is until the climax finally came. After reflection I describe this film as entirely dishonest with its audience. This dishonesty kills the potential for that unrestrained cathartic ending we all were waiting for. Although, it did spur up quite the conversations and reflections after its viewing, it was not the types the conversations the writers clearly tried to push."
" One of the few romantic films that does not suck!
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,10,"A wonderful movie even for people who are not fans of romantic films. It's not groundbreaking or particularly challenging for the viewer, but it's definitely entertaining and sweet. Both Sam Claflin and Emilia Clarke are charming as Will Traynor and Louisa Clarke and they do justice to their book counterparts, although they do get a little cheesy towards the end but I think it's just the writers' fault. Anyway, the film is beautifully shot, the soundtrack is perfect and in general the writing is good and adequately smart, so I can forgive a few cheesy lines here and there. As far as the controversy that arose over the way the film ends and its treatment of the disabled, well.. If a man choosing to end his life on his own terms is offensive then so be it. I personally think it fit the character's arrogant and stubborn personality even though I'd prefer an 'easy' and satisfactory happy ending. But then again, if there was a happy ending, there would be a whole new bunch of complaints about the stupid love-conquers-all cliché, or how Will's parents and Lou would be patronizing him, or any other crap that someone might think of. I do agree that representation of people with disabilities should be better. BUT that is not this movie's problem."
" Pretty good movie, with occasional shots at greatness
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,8,"""Me Before You"" is a definite contender for the most known romantic drama of 2016. But first things first: This one here runs for 110 minutes and was directed by Thea Sharrock while Jojo Moyes adapted her own novel for the screen here. And the result isn't shabby at all as this one scored a decent deal of awards recognition that turned the film into by far the most known work for both writer and director. And while male lead actor Sam Claflin has already starred next to the likes of Kristen Stewart, Jennifer Lawrence, Johnny Depp and other pretty big names from Hollywood, there is no denying that he plays only second fiddle here to female lead Emilia Clarke. The latter is of course known to millions, if not billions, from Game of Thrones, but good news is that thanks to the different hair color, it is very easy to not see her Daenarys character this time which may have hurt the film overall. I think she did a very good job. Her energetic, sparkling presence was one of the best aspects about the film and makes it easy to forgive her for occasional moments of ""overthetopness"", for example when her boyfriend arrives on her birthday and she tells everybody that somebody rang the doorbell. They also really tried to make her look not as gorgeous as she is, which was a huge challenge as even in these strange clothes she was obviously still a huge stunner. Claflin did a very good job too and he had the difficult task that really all his acting had to take place above his neck because of the character's disability. I found him memorable. Other known names include Charles Dance, Oscar nominee McTeer or Matt Lewis from Harry Potter, but honestly those were just in the shadows of the two protagonists because their material simply wasn't on the same level in terms of both quality and quantity.As a whole, I thought this was a really good film. The writing was smart on many occasions and it is always a success for films closer to 120 minutes than to 90 minutes if they drag as little as this one here. It also manages to stay away from the pretentious side and there was the danger it could enter this area on several occasions. But it managed nicely. The film is also not trying to make any political statements as it really is all about the tragic(?) story of the two protagonists here. Some scenes stay in mind especially like when he reveals his suicide plans to her because his body was a cage. Or also the scene in which she is watching an old video of him before the accident. The film included exactly the right approach to romance too in my opinion. They did not have to go for a huge love story or anything in order to have the tragedy work here. If you enjoyed this film as much as I did, then let me recommend you ""A Walk to Remember"" or ""Griffin and Phoenix"" or ""The Notebook"" although I am sure you have at least seen the latter already. Back to this one here, I do share the praise and I think it is an achievement that feels both real and touching. Maybe it is generally more for women, but definitely not exclusively if you manage to open yourself up here to the fate of the two protagonists. I also quite like the title. I am not a Game of Thrones fan at all, so I guess this makes up for a slight Emilia Clarke fanboy tendency and turns me into a neutral observer. A good, no a great watch for people curious about Game of Thrones stars in other projects. And actually for everybody else too. This film is among 2016's very finest and I highly recommend checking out."
" ""Live boldly. Push yourself. Don't settle.""
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,8,"Admittedly, I clicked this movie mainly due to Sam Clafflin. Thinking it would just be another cheesy romantic dramedy, I wasn't able to account for the tears rolling down my cheeks at the unexpected ending. This is definitely one of those stories that will leave a mark on me and join my other top 3 romantic films Amelie, Jeux d'Enfants and Man UpWhat set this ending apart from all the others with forgettable fate was how it balanced out the themes of redemption and sacrifice. Will's pre- accident life/pre-Louisa encounter was perfect, he was happy, successful and on top of the world in everything. Lousia's pre-Will encounter life was ordinary: she had a stable boyfriend and a generally good life but was unable to really explore the world and find herself due to financial and self imposed obligations. Will's pre-accident character would never have noticed Louisa; their worlds were too different.Their encounter gradually shifts the scales towards equilibrium. Now they're with each other every single day, their worlds opening up and slowly colliding as they share their experiences with each other. She learns about different cultures through French cinema, classical music, horse racing; he learns about the joyful simplicity of being carefree through her eccentricity and quirk. Their perspectives slowly change as they develop a mutual affection that transcends common romantic love, the type that always seems to hinge around lust and sexual attraction. Of course, there are selfish elements to their love: she needs the job for money; likes to feel needed, and he needs her companionship. But all of that is massively drowned out by the rich unconditional affection and care they develop for each other through their shared adventures. The relationship blossoms organically, and never once felt forced.The ending ultimately re-balances the karmic scale. It didn't give us a happily ever after ending because that would be massively unbalanced: you can't have your cake and eat it too. He dies, because in his view, however warped and cowardly you may think that is, it's the only way out of his pain. But his death symbolically paves the way for her new life. She's no longer trapped because, more importantly than the bit of money he left her, her meeting him opened her mind and eyes to the amazing possibilities in life. It wasn't the fancy vacations, French bakeries or luxuries being associated with wealth, it was the raw feeling of living and taking any experience to its fullest, like the unnervingly beautiful thunderstorm they watched together.Meeting him, in essence, freed her spirit. And she is now able to live her life to its full potential, in the same way he had lived his perfect life before his accident. And similarly, Will died happy and as contented as he could be. One would argue more content than before his accident, because he found for the first time, as brief as it was, a glimpse of love and affection stemming from a rare acceptance so deep as she was willing to put aside her own feelings, accept his life-ending decision and be with him until the end. They ""saved"" each other, inspired in each other hope and even though it wasn't enough to change Will's mind, and even though they didn't end up together, their encounter left a mark in each other, one that transcends time and death. It's really the purest form of love.On a macro level, I love everything about the themes; they echo my own philosophies on life and love. Even on the granular level, the few stand-out emotional performances more than made up for some of the predictable writing and tropes. In particular, the scene when Will revealed the pain of living in his current condition to Lou, that he can't accept her love and be with her like how he wanted. So much kudos to Sam's stunning performance, it was not one bit under or overacted, and I really felt all of the character's unspoken pain in those few minutes.I can understand controversies the ending created; some say it sends a bad message. But similar to Louisa's reaction to the ending of ""Of Gods and Men"", where she cried out incredulously how she didn't agreed with it, and how the main character should have stayed but all the whilst admitting she still loved the movie: that's how I felt about this ending. I didn't agree with Will's decision. He should have stayed. But I didn't take it as something negative and definitely not preaching an anti-disabled lifestyle moral either. People can't fathom why this mega rich pretty-boy wallow in so much self pity and decides to end his life when he seems to be on his way heading out of the trenches.Of course, if you were to look at this without immersing yourself in his shoes, it's tempting to say nothing about his decision makes any sense. And that's pretty true:ample psychology research tells us that the future self we envision ourselves to lead is often very far from what actually happens. What likely would happen is Will adapting to this lifestyle and living happily with Louisa. But that wasn't the point of the story. He couldn't see past his disability, no matter how much love there was.This wasn't meant to be a finding-hope-after-tragedy type of movie, and frankly, it would have fallen into the same vein as dozens of others with similar story lines if it played out that way. I took this movie as a coming of age story; love was just the undertone. Ultimately it is about finding your inner spark, and igniting that spark in others you've met. But regarding the romantic aspect, it was more than successful in its attempt to portray an ephemeral but pure unconditional bond between two people who never was meant to be together in the stark bitterness of reality."
" just terrible!
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,1,"What a horrible message (not even tackling the issue with euthanasia here), what terrible superficial characters! So, what's the idea: the simple working class girl, not having access to proper education and decent future, finds her mission in serving a rich, paralyzed guy, who throws her some money before dying because she allowed him to stick his nose in her breasts and kiss her. Watch carefully, young girls!"
" Started Well then descended into Mills & Boon Mush
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,6,"Well I like the romcom genre and this started off looking good. Clarkes big big grin and big big eyebrows did actually work in this poor girl takes a job to look after rich, handsome, throughly disabled and suicidal guy Will Traynor (Claflin) The story had the potential for an lot of depth. Traynor plans to go to Switzerland to be euthanised but promised his parents to wait 6 months to see if his outlook on his life (such as it was) changes. Clarke is brought in as a minder/suicide watch person. There are issues that the film could have covered, much much better, rich versus poor, euthanasia, disability etc I couldn't help but wonder if the roles were reversed, i.e. the poor person was the wheel chair bound quadroplegic. ? But no that would be far too miserable. Instead the makers chose to go for cheesy and safe mushy love story, where even the poor, aren't that poor, etc. A rather Disney wash on what could have been a serious but funny, tragic thought provoking movie. The acting was OK but I could not say anyone stuck out as great. If I had to pick anyone, it was Stephen Peacock as the male nurse. He did give an air of gritty reality to what otherwise ends as Mills & Boon romantic slush. Watch once, probably twice if you feel like a good old Mills & Boon boo hoo, don't forget your tissues."
" Disturbing
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,1,"Indeed the story was moving and the actors did very well, but the story itself is extremely disturbing regarding the value of human life. I can see potential for a few interpretations about Lou's take--she might still disagree with Will about his decision but she's supporting him because it's what he wants. But that's not really the question. There are definite politics here about the right to live and/or die with dignity that are very disturbing. How can we call ourselves civilized when we've come to the point that we can accept and support someone's decision to end his life simply because he can't enjoy it to the fullest as he once did? His parents were very loving and he definitely could afford to go on living. His mind was alive and well, and he was positively contributing to his society. Why are we supposed to accept this as his right to choose? Unbelievable. But that's not all. The other disturbing thing is the pushing of the notion that one can't accept life unless it's full of exotic and costly adventures. Lou wasn't free to live her life until the end when Will left her an inheritance of tons of money. Think. Life is worth living, even if you're in a wheelchair, even if you're going through hard trials, even if you don't have much money, even if your mind isn't as sharp as it once was, even if you can't do a number of things. Boo."
" A hate story
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,1,"If you are disabled, kill yourself. That's the message of the movie, packaged in a ""love"" story. It's just another attempt to undermine the sanctity of life and normalise euthanasia. Horrific. Real love sometimes means saying ""no"" to people when they're wrong. Allowing someone to commit suicide just because they are disabled is not love. Disabled people aren't second-class citizens. They are people!"
" Very relevant story
",2017-07-30 00:00:00,7,"At the heart of this movie is an emotional political issue, but first let me say something about how well done the movie is.Of course Emilia Clarke does a wonderful job and is quite lovable in Lou's quirky way. Sam Claflin has a difficult part and does it well also. Janet McTeer and Charles Dance, as Will's parents, also play difficult roles and help us get drawn into the emotion of the story. I am a Jenna Coleman fan and had to wonder what she would have been like as Lou.It becomes clear about half way in that this is not going to be a happily ever after story no matter what happens in the end.As to the politics, I am against any kind of suicide for moral reasons. I don't believe that the choice of when a person dies lies with mortal man. More importantly, I am concerned that in a society where assisted suicide becomes at all common, it also becomes very easy for various forces to take away the choices of those who want to live. Insurance companies already are very close to taking away that choice in some cases. Will and his family did not seem to have the financial pressure. For people with a family that already lives on the edge financially, a medical condition like Will's could threaten to destroy it for everyone.On the other hand, I can sympathize with the way Will felt. While I don't condone the result, I can see how the hopelessness, especially the day to day hopelessness, can lead a person to think that Will's choice is the better one.I thought this story dealt with the issue respectfully and gives plenty of reason for thought and discussion."
" .
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,9,"An outstanding performance of the cast. The story is very touching and heart-melting. I would totally recommend watching this movie, if you want to travel through the amazing lifetime journey of Lou and Will. This movie is honestly one of the most heartbreaking ones,on the other hand, includes some hilarious moments that puts the scenes closer to the reality."
" Awesome
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,10,This movie was beautiful. Louisa Clark takes a job as a caretaker for a suicidal paralyzed man whom she feels compelled to help but as it turned out it was him who actually helped her. It was just an amazing film and I watched several times and cry each time I see it. I'm only sorry I didn't see it with someone because you have to talk about this movie after you see it because it's so deep.
" A planning suicide from a rich man
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,7,"A quality romantic story, except the ending. An ordinary girl fell in love with a rich handsome paralyzed guy. Rich guy, Will had a bad temper from his car accident paralyzed; an optimist girl became his home aid. The girl always stays happy and positive, and did a lot silly things; with time, the guy was affected by her happiness too. They experienced new things from each other, started wheelchair adventures, they were in love. Then the story turned into the rich guy wanted a marcy killing. The marcy killing was his original plan because he couldn't find his life meaning after paralyzed. It is ironic, he wanted to die even after he said he is in love again.He didn't want to live because of a paralyzed body. He born to be rich, grow to be handsome and tall, all these appearance gave him the confidence, and abilities to play around. He can't bear to live as a pitiful paralyzed patient in others eyes. He couldn't find his meaning to live, even 'true love' can't help. I put a quotation marks on true love because I don't think Will was really in love with a normal girl, he probably just attracted to her energy body.Anyway I don't like this dead end, so passive. Accident always happen. But it is difficult to be rich and be loved. What a pity."
" excellent performances
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,10,"I had to see this movie because, you know, Emilia Clarke. I gave it a chance and by the end, I was crying along with her. She is totally adorable. I will date and marry her in a second. I love everything about her in this movie. Super convincing. I got the pain the Sam Claflin has and his own personal reasons. Nobody should decide for him. I wouldn't somebody deciding for me. I thought I knew how the movie was going to go based on old movies but that didn't matter at the end. Emilia can act and that is what I expect from an actor."
" Totally misleading synopsis!
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,1,"I cannot even believe the B.S. being written about the subject of this movie!!! It is NOT about romance, or at least that is a VERY distinct secondary subject. Not a single synopsis ANYWHERE mentions that the outcome of this ""grand romance"" is SUICIDE. If I had had any idea of this incredibly blatant bait-and-switch, I would have never watched it. I cannot even believe that people refer to this as a romance. WTH!?! It is about supreme self-centeredness, playing God, a girlfriend with a savior complex, parents who ultimately believe that their son killing himself is LOVING(???), how accepting and downright joyful family and friends are, and how absolutely WONDERFUL it ALL is...when someone decides to KILL THEMSELF!!! W.T.H.!!???!! If you want to see what's wrong with our society today then watch this movie, but DON'T believe it's cute or funny. It. Is. HORRID!!!"
" Claflin and Clarke waste their talents in 'Me Before You'
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,4,"Schlocky, sappy romantic dramas are a dime a dozen nowadays, and most of them follow a similar story line, just swapping out a few elements, circumstances and characters. In 'Me Before You,' we get to know the story of a young man named Will Trainer who loses his sense of freedom due to an accident that leaves him paralyzed (Sam Claflin), and a young unemployed woman named Lou who gets a job as his caretaker (Emilia Clarke).As expected, 'You' is as formulaic as they come. At the outset, Will and Lou are at odds with each other, but they soon begin to tolerate and then love each other, and then a wrench gets thrown into things before everything ends melodramatically. While that is the general flow of events, there is a hope that something about the film is differentiated from the rest of what we've seen before. Unfortunately, that is not the case.As solid as Claflin and Clarke have been in other work, they come across as hollow, wooden and appear to be less skilled actors than we all know they are. There are some supporting performances from Janet McTeer and Charles Dance that are okay, but they are nothing to really write home about. So, when the plot is below average and the acting is forgettable, it's hard for a film to be enjoyable unless there is are amazing visual effects, soundtrack, etc. While the best element of 'You' is its soundtrack, this is not enough to carry the film.If you like film adaptations of Nicholas Sparks novels (and this is not one of those, but it sure feels like one), then you will probably enjoy 'Me Before You.' If not, resist the temptation to give it a chance."
" Great love story and good acting
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,3,"I've seen The Intouchables, and I feel that this movie is just a copy, with a touch of love story and a dude with a poor mentality. Great acting, crappy writing as some others in here has pointed out, and the rest; blah. I kinda feel the same way as mentioned by others; I mean, he has so much more to fight for, a great family, great resources and a lot of money that i can basically do whatever he wants in life. That said, I feel it sends out a poor message to those in the same situation, just with the lack of family, resources and money that this guy have. 3/10."
" Be grateful with your life...
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,9,"A good movie doesn't have to be either bad or good at the end of it. This movie show me that sometimes, a movie just need to end the way it is. That's just how it should be.How Lou react to Will's explanation about ending his life, is not right. What could you expect from a paralyzed man that already live the awesome life before? Don't be a selfish movie viewer, we can enjoy love story about Will & Lou for 2 hours movie, but imagine how Will's life if he need to continue his next 50 years of life that way? That's why, i think the movie ended the way it should.Be grateful with your life, live it."
" 2 stars
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,2,"Yep. I hated it. I didn't find the girl super likable or well developed, the fashion was so far out there it was awful. It felt like there was very little character development there, we are meant to take her as a ""chatty Cathy"" but it doesn't seem that way. She's not that quick of a talker or that much of one. Likewise there is little reason to believe she hated the guy- he wasn't super developed either. Seemed like they hated / endured each other and then it switched all of the sudden. The male character had a chance to grow but didn't. It could have foreshadowed the ending better, (Scenes where she walks in and he IS in pain and hides it after he notices her, or times when he's a little crabby to other people and she brushes it off) I didn't find his decision that inline with the man that was portrayed, making him a hypocrite when he tells Clark to go on and live her life to the fullest.There are several themes made by the ending that I fully disagree with. 1. If you're in enough pain, it's OK to kill yourself. 2. Its better to die than to be a burden. 3. You can choose to die, it's not selfish, and after a month, the girl you had WATCH your death will be totally OK and without grief. 4. If all else fails, give said girl a trust fund and you can buy her happiness, and she won't grieve anymore. 5. Death is romantic.Yes, you can say it's up to the viewer to decide to take out of it, but these themes were implied by Clark's lack of remorse or sadness at the end. There are reviewers that say it highlights the joy of living and it is only the male that goes against them, but the happy way the end was portrayed discredits the highlights given.The few things I did like: The castle and rich people house and quality of film was OK."
" Euthanasia of the cinematography?
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,2,"Please, tell me how I can remove from my mind the image of Emilia Clarke while playing this movie. Her face seems in each single frame, a stop motion play-dough effect. Her eyebrows move in an uncontrolled way and the result is so... horrific. Damned, but how in 2017 is possible to play in such a devastating, totally not-credible way? Not even for one second I entered the illusion of reality, thanks to the Joker-like smiles of Emilia. And it was really a torture for my mind to reach the closing titles. And the plot... Can you imagine a more ordinary and trivial euthanasia tale? No, really it's impossible. Everything is so easy, plain, slipping towards the more predictable of all the predictable ending... Pls, while watching this movie, don't use a single neuron, it's not necessary. This is clearly just food for romantic teardrops sprinkling ladies, but definitely cannot be defined a movie."
" The Worst Movie Ever
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,1,"This has got to be the worst movie I have ever watched. I don't know if I'm being overly critical due to having recently read the book, but I genuinely feel that this movie has got to be the worst book to movie adaptation.I thought that nearly every scene was over dramatized. Too much emotion where it is not needed.The relationships between several key characters were awkward, there was no chemistry between them. In particular the relationship between Lou and Will was terrible, I partially thought that maybe it was the actors that created the poor chemistry. Although I thought that individually their acting was brilliant and I love Emilia Clarke, but together they did just not work! In fact I was kind of embarrassed for them. Lou and Treena's relationship was also all wrong! Poor casting of Jenna Coleman as Treena.I was absolutely appalled by the errors in the story line. There were too many changes that effected the way that the characters are portrayed. Key ideas and events were often squeezed into the same sentence where in the book the same ideas were spread throughout. Some events were left out entirely. Multiple events were merged into one. Things that were done or said by a certain character were then said by a different character. And, there were characters missing all together!! Will's sister Georgie?? I appreciate that it is probably difficult to fit a whole book into the time of a movie but I feel that in this case it has been poorly done. Vital information is missing that would have been critical to character development and would have helped refine the whole movie!I had high hope for this movie after reading what turned out to be an absolute page turner of a book, but I have been left miserably disappointed."
" A truly beautiful film
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,8,"I never mind what critics think of movies. I turned this on to watch because of Emilia Clarke. This is a totally different turn from ""Game of Thrones"", and she is marvelous. Sam Claflin is beautifully tragic as a man who has lost the ability to be who he was, not willing to settle for who he is. The chemistry between them was sincere, not forced. A growing affection, laughter, joy. There is always a chance for joy in any circumstance. That should be the tag-line for this film. It was set in breath-taking scenery, and the music at various moments set a frame perfectly for that instant. I loved this film."
" Amazing and Fresh... Almost passed up this heart tugger.
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,10,"Emilia Clarke; WOW. In fact, the small but amazing cast was all the right fit. Not sure where or what the critics are barking about, the sweet, fresh story saddled up with the right cast, issues, plot, and what's going to happen next, is literally a perfect composure. The musical score is not just spot on, it's quite impressive! The film takes the stance of being in two difficult places, one from a quadriplegic and two, an endearing young British lady who just needs a job - but is as bubbly, cute, color and inexperienced as you could possibly be! The story here makes great sincerity and now, I really wonder if the book could be as good as what was depicted, shot and showed. Clarke's facial expressions are spot on and you clearly see the vastness of such a bright actress. She shows more in this film than in GOT and obviously in Terminator. In fact, she slimmed down so much and looks amazing that in this physical form, she fits the youthful and vibrant stance of the character to perfection with her bright smile. 'Will Traynor' is played perfectly and you believe he is - a quad. His attitude is spot on not to mention it feels realistic no matter what your background may have been. Eloquently, the two become interested in each other and this is where the story becomes even richer as you wish for a certain outcome... Very well written if not one of THE best films I clearly was going to overlook. The critics are shamingly very wrong on this one. It'll darn near tear on your heart and the scenes and locations were the right fit. I'm struggling to find negatives to identify, but honestly, if there are, they're very far and in between as your mind stays with the plot and keeps you moving. Loved it. Completely loved it and I do NOT like 'endearing love' style of movies. There is a plot twist that shows itself midway and for a unique step, it challenges the writing. Well done; I praise the script and those that approved it. It'll leave you in a torn spot among movies in the past, for it truly moves the soul here. Simply, loved it. Cheers!"
" Why listen to critics?
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,9,"This movie is NOT about suicide or doomed love. This movie is about two people learning to see and love life because they focus on someone besides themselves.I thought the movie wonderful. I smiled all the way through and though I disliked how it ended, with Will dying, a main point of the story would have been lost."
" A surprisingly good film
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,6,"I don't watch 'Game of Thrones' - I know that in itself is a crime - so I hadn't really seen anything Emilia Clarke had been in prior to watching this film. However, she's so good in this it's ridiculous. Warm, funny, engaging, it's not to say that she carries the film, because of course Sam Caflin (who I only knew from the horrible 'Love Rosie' does his fair share, but she shines in her role.The film itself is much better than I thought it would be. It's heartfelt without ever being sentimental, it's full of engaging moments. I don't know why the critics weren't more positive about it.I didn't start watching this film with high hopes, but I was very pleased to be proved wrong."
" Me Before You - Review
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,1,"Where to begin...? Alright, Emilia Clarkes eyebrows are atrocious... As for the story. Rich boy has an accident ends up with a spinal cord injury and paralysed and fails to accept his fate and sticks to his decision to kill himself at the end because he's missing his old life. My issues with this stinker of a movie. 1. There is absolutely no depth to the main characters. One dimensional, materialistic morons who are absolutely unrelatable. 2. What is the message of this movie? 3. I'd find it easy as well to smile at the end, in memory of the person I loved, if that person would have left me rich after passing away. 4. One of the points, if not THE point of this tripe seems to be ""Once you are in a wheelchair you are out."" WOW, this kind of rubbish in 2017. However as far as this movie goes, the before the injury and after the injury was not teased out, kinda essential if your main character kills himself at the end and you want your audience to either understand his decision or to root for him. 5. If the audience would have had a chance to relate to both before and after injury, it would have been a better movie. 6. If the actual struggles and challenges of living with this injury would have been portrayed in a realistic enough way, it would have been a better movie. 7. If the main actress would have been able to actually act, it would have been a better movie. 8. If the main character would have been portrayed as a human being capable of making decisions for himself and people respected and supported him, regardless if they agreed or not, it would have been a better movie. This movie is so one dimensional it is not even comical. It utterly misrepresents living with a spinal injury and relations to personal assistants."
" unrealistic cotton candy
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,3,"For people who read the book, please ignore the movie. I definitely should have, but I was too curious. To the rest of you, ignore it as well. Read the book. First of all, this is a beautiful film. Beautiful people, beautiful scenery, Beautiful beautiful beautiful! There's just one problem, Will's life isn't so effing beautiful. Neither is Lou's. Where Jojo Moyes uses humor to lighten up the dark of Will's accident, the movie tries to gloss over everything! It made me sick. Lou is so cute, but annoyingly so. And I understand that Will is supposed to be handsome, but the character-developing is flat compared to the book, and the whole point of their acquaintance is lost! A major point in the book is excluded completely! It's one of the things that makes sense to Lou's character. Jojo Moyes books are quite realistic, in a sense, because of her character's flaws. It makes you relate. Unfortunately, this does not come across in the movie, and there goes the humor, as well. I had to force myself to finish this one, as it felt like the movie was strangling me with cotton candy."
" It's a beautiful masterpiece in its own right but .....
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,7,"There are not many things in this world that evoke such conflicting emotions in me yet in this tragedy I find beauty beyond what words could ever say..... these are the musings of a mad woman after watching this movie. There are some things which were a bit rushed in my opinion but I have to say that the ending did it for me, had it been the opposite I would have hated the movie"
" Bad acting and cliché story writing
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,1,I was avoiding this movie because I knew how horrible Emilia Clarke is as an actress but this wasn't just bad acting it was also horrible melodramatic sappy writing. Emilia Clarke's eyebrows contouring into weird spaghetti in every scene is the grossest thing I've ever seen. Worst movie ever
" Sad but amazing love story...
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,10,This movie to me was a sad but amazing love story now I have never heard of Sam Claflin until now but he was great as Will Traynor in the beginning you see him with his girlfriend in bed then you see him leave it's pouring with rain he ends up getting hit by a motorcycle while crossing the road that's obviously how he was paralyzed and ended up in the wheelchair then you get a bit of background on Emilia Clarke's character Louisa Clark and how she's hired to take care of him from there they slowly start to warm up to each other and fall in love when she finds out that Will has attempted to commit suicide that he wants to die she does everything in her power to change his mind even takes him on vacation with him and his nurse but there is a scene the last night of their vacation this is closer to the end so this is a huge spoiler don't read any further if you have not seen this...she finds out that she's failed and that all her efforts were pointless she had fallen deeply in love with him by this time he tells her that he still wants to die and nothing will change his mind that he is leaving for Switzerland with his parents his intention was to die there she starts to cry calls him selfish and tells him she wishes she'd never met him now this was probably the most emotional scene in the movie for me apart from the ending which I won't spoil I had to physically force myself not to cry I really did love this it was beautiful this is the 2nd movie I've seen with Emilia Clarke I haven't seen her in anything else except for this and Terminator Genisys which I also love. Now I'm not sure if the director of this is British or American but wherever he's from he did a great job with this movie and I applaud him for it I hope to see more movies like this in the future I really think Emilia Clarke should get herself out there more because I'm not sure that she has done that much but I think she's an amazing actress even though I've only seen her in 2 movies. I highly recommend you watch this if you haven't yet I give it a 10/10 to me it was perfect.
" This is a Must See movie!
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely loved this movie. It keeps getting better as it goes along. Wow. This is going to be one of my all time favorite movies. I loved everything about this movie, the casting, the story. Emilia Clarke is stunning, captivating and versatile. A sweet, kind, dream of a love story. A real love story."
" I cried 😭😭😭
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,10,"Having never read the original material it's based on I can't say how it holds up against the book, however as movie on it's own it's what you pretty much expect from just having watched the trailers. It's clichéd, emotional, predictable, you're not going to get anything new here. The story is beautifully told and there's great chemistry between Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, they both give strong performances. Despite the cliche's if you like romantic dramas then I think this is something you will like."
" Thought it would be right up my alley, but couldn't even finish it.
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,5,"I love rom/romcoms. I love Sam Claflin. When I saw this trailer, therefore, I thought it would be right up my alley. I didn't read the book, so I went into this viewing with no preconceptions or standards to be met. I thought it was too bubbly, too cheesy/cutesy. Miss Clarke's crazy eyebrows shooting up into her hairline to imitate a look of bemusement, surprise, condolence, placation and everything else was driving me batty. Her little girl striped and polka-dotted outfits and her personality felt very contrived and forced, her moving from a waitress in a bakery to a home companion for a filthy rich family is out in left field, too. I just couldn't. I felt there was nowhere near enough chemistry in the two main characters to hold my interest enough to even finish the film."
" Because it made me cry
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,10,"Spoilers! Just in case...It made me cry, the boy doesn't get the girl of his dreams and the girl doesn't end up marrying the boy of her dreams. Sometimes life is like that and it was very refreshing seeing Emilia Clarke play a quirky fun character."
" Enjoyable manipulative
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,6,"The weepy ""Me Before You"" stars Sam Clafin, an actor so photogenic had movies not been invented before his birth, they surely would have developed once he hit puberty just so he had some way of sharing how handsome he is. Thewestchestarian wonders how he didn't get the ""50 Shades of Grey"" lead ahead of dead-on-the-inside Jamie Dornan. Sam also brings a delightful ""English-ness"" to the role overshadowing the Campbell Scott original ""Dying Young"". Despite her London upbringing Emilia Clarke (please consider that final ""e"" when pronouncing her surname Americans) doesn't bring that same underlying seriousness and gravitas that English actors contribute. The two work well together although you can see Clafin dictating the relationship and Clarke reacting to him more than acting. The story they act in is a bit what you would expect. Will's life basically went from the top of human experience to some area below average although he remains very wealthy and can afford every accommodation a quadriplegic could ask for. He deals with justifiable anger and suicidal thoughts which ""Lou"" holds eases but ultimately doesn't relieve. Any interesting aspect of the story is the personal growth Lou undergoes through her association with Will and, perhaps to a greater degree, his upper crust wealthy family. The movie doesn't shy away from the obvious class differences in English society. In short, you largely know where the story is headed and much of the direction is aimed at jerking forth tears but it is worth the ride."
" Love conquers all - or does it?
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,6,"This film shook me quite a bit. And I might be a chick, but usually I'm not one for chick flicks. They can be good to pass the time. At their worst they're flat out offensive, using serious themes to pretend they're more than they really are. Like the misery of the Third World - see 'Beyond Borders"". Or cancer, see ""The Fault In Our Stars"". So when I hear of a chick flick dealing with war or death or sickness, that's what I fear. Flat, mindless characters that are there just to fall in love in spite of everything, because, you know, love conquers all. But for one: for all you could say about Emilia Clarke, she's never flat. She's lovely. She's a top-notch actress, and I can't imagine anyone who would give this role this much warmth and steadiness. People like Lou - grown-up children, with both childlike innocence and more wisdom than the rest of us - are a rare breed, but they do exist, and she captured this perfectly. Her eyebrows are a gift from god. She was the first good thing about ""Me Before You"". I still wouldn't remember much of it if it wasn't for the second one - the ending. I've read a couple of reviews for this film and people seem to get the ""live boldly"" slogan as its message. They miss the fact that it's also a movie that debates assisted suicide. And actually argues in favor of it. As a person who has gone through a debilitating illness, I appreciate the fact that it doesn't maintain that any life is worth living or something along those lines. This is something that only people who don't know the first thing about being sick can state - and that I see mainstream cinema argue much too often. I still don't think it's a good movie. I give it a 6, because most of it is calculated just to repeat the success of ""The Fault In Our Stars"" and such. But there was something visceral in it that cracked through the Hollywood facade and that cracked me in turn, because I didn't expect it there. Watch it, somehow it's worth it."
" Summary
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,9,"When a critic can't find words to describe a movie, that's says a lot. Im not considering myself even amateur critic, so I'm even more speechless.Jojo Moyes, brilliant script. Every aspect of the movie is create with perfection. There is 1 error tho- the shoes of Emilia Clarke were way too loud in order to hear all the conversation between the parents without getting detected by them.Emilia Clarke, good as always. That eyebrows man, that eyebrows, perfect face muscle control. She can act every emotion perfectly!Sam Claflin, he could be better, he need to develop his talent further.As for support role i give my gold medal to Stephen Peacocke. His acting was without a doubt the best from the support crew.Janet McTeer, she get my silver medal. Especially on the scene from the airport, when they returned from the vacation, brilliant act hands down."
" Worst possible message EVER
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,1,"Repeat, spoiler alert. Though, if you're wise, you won't waste your time on this movie.A summary would be, enter William, a rich, spoiled playboy who has everything he wants and does anything he wants with whomever he wants. Then he has a tragic accident, leaving him paralyzed. He decides that this kind of life isn't worth living, and wants to be killed. He promises his parents 6 months, where enters Lou, the charming, high-spirited woman who in an effort to show him life IS worth living (in which is still an entirely self-centered focused only on making himself happy), she falls in love with him. All seems to be going well, they think he has abandoned thoughts of suicide... but no. He selfishly decides to throw his life away, because he can't have everything his way. And it is wrapped in a cloak of care, and love, and support to people's decisions... but ultimately, it is sending the message, ""It doesn't matter who loves you, or how important you can be, or what you can do for others... if YOU don't have EVERYTHING you want and have it YOUR way, just give up."" In a day when depression and suicides are at an all-time high, here comes a story that had the potential to be a great encouragement to anyone dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts, but instead encourages people to give up and throw it all away.Especially when you think of the high percentage of suicides or attempts by teenage girls, and an actor like Sam who is idolized by many, presenting this message, it is appalling that such messages are being presented as ""entertainment""."

",2017-02-15 00:00:00,4,"Featuring the strange proposition of The Mother of Dragons living a life where she cares for the tragically paralysed son of Tywin Lannister, Me Before You is 2016's attempt at becoming ""the big romantic hit"" as debut director Thea Sharrock adapts Jojo Moyes well liked book of the same name, which is in turn a rejigged version of the 2011 hit The Intouchables into a totally over the top and highly overdone romantic drama.In what's her highest profile gig outside of the 6 seasons of playing Game of Thrones beloved dragon mother, Brit star Emilia Clarke goes next level of loving life as the seemingly carefree and unflappable stocking loving Lou Clark who takes up the job of becoming a friend to The Hunger Games Sam Claflin's quadriplegic Will Traynor, that will in turn see the two fall tragically in love as Will contemplates ending his now unfortunately paralysed life.It's an intriguing idea, if not totally original and there's potential here for many tears, laughs and smiles but everything within Sharroack's film feels either forced, full of fakery or misjudged emotional manipulations as Clarke in particular suffers from her role in the film that allows her to go completely wild with her unfortunately annoying and coy Lou and it really does beg the question of how much of a career she may have outside of the GOT universe if she continues on in this fashion.Lou Clark may just be last year's most intolerable creation, as while we all love someone that sees the brighter side of life, this is something else entirely as Clarke and her eyebrows, over extended smile and genuine ADHD tendencies trample the films chances as Lou and Will's relationship turns from forced friendship to genuine love.Clarke needed to dial back her role especially as Claflin gives his all as Will (even if you've never seen a quadriplegics body looked quite this toned before) and while the film clearly connected with its ready-made target audience as evidenced by its respectable world-wide box office and audience ratings, it's unlikely that many will be remembering the hard fought romance of Lou Clark and Will Traynor as we'd remember the Noah and Allie's or Edward Lewis and Vivian Wards of the movie universe.A refreshingly kind spirited movie that just never connects emotionally or engages thanks to a so-so structure and a completely misguided female centrepiece, Me Before You will be a favourite to those that loved the movie before they even saw it but for the rest of us, this sappy, cringe-worthy and forgettable romance just doesn't cut the romantic mustard.2 fit Neville Longbottom's out of 5"
" Me Before You works mostly because of Emilia Clark's charming screen presence and few moments but its climax is shocking.
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,7,"Me Before You (2016): When I read plot line of Me Before You,I was surprised to find it exactly similar to the french classic Intouchables (which was remade in Telugu as Oopiri),only in the other way around.The only difference is they have given a female lead in the caretaker role and as usually love blossoms between them even with such physical differences.But the only reason I watched this movie is for my Princess Khaleesi aka Daenerys Targaryen aka her off screen real name Emilia Clarke.Plot: Louisa Clark (Emilia Clark) is a small town girl who knows a lot about the people around her. Will (Sam Claflin) a quadriplegic man who hates everyone around him. Louisa is hired by Will's mum to take care of him for six months. Although they have a rocky start, their relationship grows over time, going for hate, to like, to love.What I felt: With exactly the same plot and almost same type of scenes like Intouchables ,Me Before You mostly works on Emilia Clarke's charming performance.Other than that,this movie has very few feel good moments but mostly the screenplay is totally predictable.These movies would only work if it has lot of feel good moments which can bring tears but this movie has none literally.The dinner ate Clark's home and the scene where Clark and Will dances and the scene where they watch a movie are the scenes which are the highlight of the movie.As said earlier,Emilia Clark's charming screen presence helped the movie a lot.But her expressions with eyebrows are weird.It felt like she can even move her eyebrows downwards to ;-o.So apart from that she really is charming and I never even imagined Khaleesi being cute like this.Sam Claflin,whom I have seen earlier in Love,Rosie is very good in his role of a quadriplegic man.Music also helped the movie in lot of scenes.But the major surprise in this film is its daring climax.Most of them would not accept this ending (Including me to an extent),but as a fiction we cannot blame the director/writer.But he could have tried other options because this may affect lot of such disabled persons ideology.So,Me Before You works mostly because of Emilia Clark's charming screen presence and few moments but its climax is shocking.My rating 6.5/10"
" his movie treads a tricky line, both infuriating and charming viewers.
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,8,"This movie treads a tricky line, both infuriating and charming viewers. Emilia Clarke tries to fill the emotional vacuum with full-on kook as a carer for a hunky quadriplegic in Thea Sharrock's wipe- clean romance. The charm can be chalked up to star Clarke; she makes Lou the type of beguiling creature we've seen in films before who's often known as a ""manic pixie dream girl"" -- quirky, irreverent, and usually irresistible. Which is also where the infuriation comes in: The MPDG usually serves the function of making a male protagonist feel lightened and leavened, without experiencing much development herself. Fully enjoyable movie, sit with pop-corn and enjoy."
" Basic British romantic comedy
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,6,"After reading the book I really wanted to see the movie. I knew adaptations are never the same as the original, and I was curious what they have changed. But this movie left out a huge and very important information, that gives a whole new level to the relationship of Lou and Will. Now the movie's lesson is that if you have money, you can leave your comfort zone - While the book showed, how a young and healthy woman can be more ""paralyzed"" (by her fear) than a man with quadriplegia. I was a bit disappointed, and I highly recommend everyone, who loved this movie to read the book as well. They will see what I missed so much."
" so and so
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,6,"Τhis movie has definitely the potential to be characterized as a good movie. Good acting by most of the actors, nice scenes, direction and musical score. Still after watching the whole movie i was kind of disappointed. Okay, the makers wanted to give a tragic finale to the story but in the end what's the meaning of the movie? 1.The protagonist indeed suffers a lot cause he is paraplegic , but in my opinion that's not a reason for what he decided to do. Many people in a wheelchair out there continue fighting with the difficulties they face without losing their desire to live. 2. Perhaps it's cynical what i will say , but if you think it from the beginning of the movie the story is about a poor girl who is stacked with her life , that makes her paraplegic employer to fell in love with her - despite the fact she seemed to loved him back- and after he dies to leave her an amount of money... I can find many reasons to like the movie but the more i think about it i find equally enough reasons to dislike it.."
" Taking control
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,6,"I haven't read the novel this is based on, but as with anyone else, I could also tell where this was heading. It's not really hard to tell, so it's not about the finish line itself, rather than how we get there. And it's a pretty entertaining (while also sad) movie experience. If you let yourself into the romantic world, that is cliché ridden to quite some extent.Also some paper thin characters and two people who desperately needed each other, even without knowing that (we knew, but you know I'm talking about). So while one has a partner, that does not seem to be a big obstacle. Especially when that person isn't the one. Ah, the simple structures hidden in very tragic events and personal stories. But this has a certain suave to it, because of the main actors who really do carry this, although it doesn't have too much to ride on. If you are into these kinds of movies, you'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll have a movie watching experience you were yearning for."
" Will Traynor definitely has the wrong outlook on life,
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,7,"'ME BEFORE YOU': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A rom-com/drama about a paralyzed former banker, that's planning to kill himself, who falls for his new caregiver. The movie stars Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin (as the two leads), and it costars Charles Dance, Janet McTeer, Steve Peacocke, Matthew Lewis, Brendan Coyle and Jenna Coleman. It was directed by first time feature filmmaker Thea Sharrock, and it was written by Jojo Moyes; adapted from her 2012 novel, of the same name. The film has received mixed reviews from critics, and some negative backlash from the disability rights movement (over what they perceive to be a very negative message about people with disabilities). Despite the negative controversy, the movie was a huge hit at the Box Office (making over $200 million worldwide). I do understand how some people could be offended by this film, but I also think it's a well made, and sometimes very touching, movie.Louisa Clark (Clarke) had worked for a local café, for six years, when she's unexpectedly laid off from it. Desperate to find work, she responds to a caregiver job opening; working for a wealthy family named the Traynors. Will Traynor (Claflin) was a successful banker, before he was paralyzed (two years earlier) in a motorcycle accident. He's now very cynical, and he's not very welcoming of Louisa's assistance. After some time though, the two begin to get along quite well; despite the fact that Louisa has a boyfriend (Lewis). When Louisa learns that Will is planning to kill himself, she tries to come up with a list of things for him to do; in order to make him love life again. Will feels like he's too much of a burden on others though, to keep on living, despite his strong feelings for Louisa. I definitely think that the Will Traynor character (in this film) has the wrong outlook on life; and his views definitely shouldn't be encouraged, or promoted (and it does seem like that's what the movie is kind of doing). So I understand why people are offended by this film; but if you look at it just as being the way that this specific character sees life though, than I think it's something that could possibly be overlooked. Despite this major flaw, the movie is very well made; the main characters (despite their flaws) are very likable, and the film is quite moving (at times). The two lead performances are both good, and it's great to see another strong female empowering role, like the one that Clarke plays, as the central character in a big movie like this. It's also nice to see both a talented woman director, as well as a gifted female screenwriter, behind a major film like this. It's just a shame that the movie has that one major flaw to it though.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/_SLO5GYrmps"
" a love story ruined in so many levels
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,6,The whole story was a beautiful classic love story filled with happy memories for Will so he would find the value and beauty of his new life and not to take it for granted. first of all the whole story was brilliant and it could've been pictured in a way better scenario. Emilia Clarck was trying too hard to picture the Clark character and her making all those faces and playing with her eyebrows in every scene not only made it ridiculously unnatural but it also made the viewer confused about her face expression. by the end of the movie I was confused if she's sad for losing Will or happy or even so sad that she's smiling nervously to cover her pain.she had the wide smile with those funny wavy eyebrows. I'm not a professional but I found the direction very amateur. there could have been way more beautiful scenes where us.the viewers could actually feel the love is being build up between them. and at last the ending was not my favorite. I loved the tragic ending but it could have been finished in a more loving way. I've said all the negative points but there's no doubt that the love story was perfect and Sam Claflin did a marvelous job picturing Will's struggles and pain. nice job Sam ♥
" The ending spoils a sweet, cheerful and funny film!
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,7,"I remember a few years ago having a discussion with a friend on the Bollywood film 'Guzaarish' (2010) - a film that holds 95% similarities to it. His opinion was that a film (or a film-maker to be precise) is under no moral obligation to show the right ""thing"", the right ending or showing something that matches the common standards of ""rightness"", and that a film is just a recording of a story - right or wrong doesn't even come into the picture.Although he did make a very solid and thought-provoking point, the point remained in my view that this too depends on the gravity of the topic and how sensitive it is; and making a film about physically challenged people is a sensitive theme, just like rape is. I asked him whether he'll stick to his otherwise very intellectual point if someone were to make a film about a habitual rapists who and end the film on the note that he goes on to lead a very wonderful life full of happiness. He got stuck there, and this remained my standard to judge films: in short, the topic, its gravity and sensitivity is all that it depends on.So that remains a problem with this film and I can fully understanding the reactions that it's getting from physically challenged people and such organisations. I'd still give it seven stars because it was otherwise a very, sweet, cheerful and funny film (I understand one isn't supposed to behave that rudely with anyone, but Will's witty replies were really hilarious!), and highly engaging too with its theme revolving around freedom and being yourself, being true to yourself. Despite a bad ending, the last scene with Louisa walking away with those striped socks was really heartening, and, again, despite that, I couldn't help praising the film because it was incredibly sweet.I remember I blasted 'Guzaarish' back then, but the reason for that wasn't only the topic but also the fact that the film was dull and boring beyond words! So there's a difference between the two.As a footnote, I thought Louisa's ex-boyfriend got a harsh treatment. He wasn't at fault too much and was neither a bad guy. Showing him as a the ""Other type of guy"" could've actually pressed more on the ""freedom"" angle, but alright. They didn't show something that isn't possible: falling in love with another guy/girl than your boyfriend/girlfriend. It happens, whether that is alright or not or whether it qualifies as cheating is a debate for another day and place.*Most of what I've written in criticism of the film applies to the book too of course that it is based on.*"
" Loved it.
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,10,"I loved the plot and the characters. It's the kind of movies that stays with you long after you watch it. Even though i don't agree with the ""Mercy killing"" concept but this movie was so full of emotions that you end up feeling the pain and joy of its characters. Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin were amazing, Lou or Clark's(Emilia Clarke) character was very easy to relate to and no women in her right mind wouldn't fall in love with Will(Sam Claflin). I also couldn't help falling in love with William's father (Charles Dance) and Lou's father (Brendan Coyle). This movie was not just another ""love story"" it makes you think about life and death, it's highly recommended and you'll want to watch it again."
" Eyebrows
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,6,"I wanted so badly to like this film, but Emilia Clarkes facial expressions ruined what could have been a lovely piece of cinema.Based on the novel by Jojo Moyes, Me Before You is a supposed ""unconventional love story"" about a wealthy paralysed man and his relationship with newly-employed carer, Louisa.My first criticism about this is..eyebrows. Emilia Clarke is a poor actress who seems to only be able to convey any sort of emotion with her eyebrows and goofy smiles. In some scenes she is over-acting to the point of making me cringe. It meant that any realism of the film was totally ruined. In fact, the character of Louisa on the whole was unlikeable, unrealistic and un-relatable. She is supposedly from a working-class family and has little money. Though wears expensive looking clothes, lives in a beautiful area and is extremely eloquent. She came across as nothing more than a middle-class, ""woe-me, I'm so quirky and misunderstood"" girl.Secondly is Will Traynor, Initially he is a cold character who treats Louisa with disrespect. But as the story unfolds he becomes warmer and more likable.All in all, Me Before You isn't terrible, it has some lovely moments and has stunning scenery. It is worth watching but the poor cast sadly lets it down."
" Heartbreaking and very selfish.
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,1,"Might be some spoilers.I loved the whole story, it is brilliant. Well, it is standard story: hating the whole world disabled person and the charming and cheerful one, who takes care of another. But Will's will to choose that way of the remaining 'life' was crushing both mine and Louisa's hearts. He should've found strength in himself to live. Doesn't matter if in pain or constant agony. At least he should've lived for her. All of us saw that they fell in love. I hate people who choose to be selfish, to make themselves priority number one, because they are tired. The world and life doesn't work that way. You must want to live.I have been sobbing my ass off for an hour straight. I would have given an A+++, but Will's decision made it to the damn F-. Even the name of the movie says it all, how he loves or loved HIMSELF BEFORE (the accident and later) HER. My tears are out of fierceness.Anyway. Worth watching, but be prepared. And prepare some tissues for your running nose.Cheers,BUPD: I slept really bad the night after seeing the movie. Woke up crying like a baby and can't stop doing it. It is infuriating."
