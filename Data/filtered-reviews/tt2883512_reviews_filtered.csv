" Bland flavor, mealy texture, but oh ... an occasional crunch
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,4,"I'd never heard of this movie until I saw it on my streaming platform and assumed it was one of their own productions.Having enjoyed some cooking competition shows I thought it would be interesting ... it wasn't.Hackneyed writing with tepid delivery, poorly developed characters, comical and cringey drama, and a food truck. My rating of 4 stars isn't due to the high-caliber talent nor the fact that it probably wasn't filmed in his mom's basement, but because of my enjoyment of food and its preparation.The greatest potential for story driving drama was between protagonist chef Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) and (Gordon?) Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt) the influential food critic yet even the talented Platt couldn't bring any more passion than a plain peanut butter sandwich on white bread; as for Favreau - I don't know if he has any dramatic chops to begin as for his writing and directing skills ... maybe start with summer stock."
" Even for this vegan, this was a feel good movie.
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,10,"I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this movie except for one joke about vegans and everyone wolfing down meat the whole time . The actors, the script and the music were all spot on in this pure feel good movie. I cannot recommend it highly enough. If I could have given it more stars I would have.Loved it."
" A Favreau Likeness
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,7,"Chef is a film that was released in 2014 starring Jon Favreau and Sofia Vergara.
We start the film off with a man who is clearly a chef of a restaurant, a big honcho kind of guy that wants order and knows what he wants. Already I am intrigued by the film since I can only hope to see some serious kitchen drama and some great food on screen.
The drama in this film is excellent, as it gives an insight as far as what can happen in the real world of chefs and the restaurant business. Carl definitely messed up his career and because of that the audience is able to perceive what will happen for the future of his career. The film is great as far as drama yes, but it does lack in some sense of a back story. It would have been excellent to have gotten an insight of who the characters were before the events of the restaurant went down and how Chef Carl came to be, but even without those details we do still have an understanding of who the characters are.
But, the film does get better and better even as we leave the restaurant scene into the world of the food truck and what Chef Carl does with his son in that business for the rest of the film. Overall the film is quite enjoyable and exciting at times, but surely not Jon Favreau's best work."
" Probably the best feel good movie I've seen in this decade
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,8,"There's not much going on in this movie, but I literally watched every second of it and was really disappointed when it ended.. it was such a feel good movie! There's just a few scenes where I felt that Jon Favreau could have done better.. There's a scene where his son is about to serve a burnt sandwich to someone who isn't paying.. now first of all, it's hard to believe that a sensitive kid like that would ever do such a thing, but the way Jon takes him in the back and gives him a load of crap about him being good at this instead of telling him to treat people well, that just really didn't make sense to me. Also the scene where he's telling him he can't work on his truck.. well he should've explained why.. but he simply says it can't be done. Those conversations should've been handled better because the movie was all about those conversations. But everyone in the movie was good otherwise. Sofia was such a beautiful presence in the movie and even Scarlett.. the food scenes are also done really well! Nice movie. Do watch it!"
" Classic Foody road trip movie
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie for so many reasons

>it's wholesome, yet has a food truck with Jon Favreau and john leguizamo singing ""sexual healing"" with a young boy.still not wierd (much)
>the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich

Classic movie. 10/10"
" A tasty feeling good movie
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,8,"I felt so happy after I finished it , it's really really one of the best ! I didn't expect John favreau to do what I saw , he is really a good actor .I loved the Cameo that RDJ made 3000.
Also I Loved the role of his wife and his kid and the relationship between them , I was so so happy when he returned to his wife
I think the message was that whatever happens to you , you can do anything you want , Don't make your life a routine , do something different ! Go and achieve your dream but don't forget your family , Spend time with them
Oh and I also was hungry after the movie , Is that good ? I think so ."
" Fun movie on many levels!
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,9,"Girl Watchers: You've got Scalett Johansson and Sophia Vargara -- TWO of the world's most beautiful women in this film -- and there is no fighting, so sex, and nothing derogatory -- just pure girl-watching at its finest here.But that's not even the best part f this film! This is a success story about a chef. You cannot say this story is just like too many other ""chef stories""!The best part is that it's a story about an overworked father at first not having time for his son; but then he works with his son and both have a blast and really get to know each other -- and there are possibilities that The Chef may even get back together with his former wife (Sophia)! Now who would't want THAT?Perhaps equally important is that The Chef learns how he can work for himself rather than others -- and he finds his best success there.Really really good film; give it a watch!!!"
" Big Heart and LOTs of FOOD!
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,9,"This film not only tells a great story about career, family and how life can take unexpected directions.. It also is a visual feast for the eyes with all the incredible cooking scenes of very elaborate to very basic dishes. Can't tell you how many times I had to pause the film and go make a fancy snack!The movie is ultimately a very positive and heart-warming tale of a chef who is so *consumed* :) with his work that he has ignored his family which has lead to divorce (although civil). He finds that even in his relative freedom from family obligations, he still cannot satisfy those he wishes to impress the most with his cooking.The pressure gets to him and finally he breaks and has to reevaluate his life and make some changes. From that point on the movie really shines in his ""starting over from scratch"" situation with refocusing on, and accepting help family and friends.It is also a great story about reconciliation and letting go of resentment and how technology can be a painful double-edged sword if not wielded correctly.Great film. Great cast and LOTs of great FOOD!"
" Very entertaining movie!
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,10,"I've always liked Jon Favreau but when this movie came out, the idea of a movie about a chef didn't have much appeal for me. But years later when I had nothing to do I checked it out on Netflix. Wow! I wish I had watched it sooner! It's the story of a successful, respected but divorced chef who finds his career and personal life spiraling out of control, particularly his relationship with his 10 year old son.Favreau was always an appealing actor (""Swingers."" ""Made,"" ""The Big Empty"") and then became an A-list director. ""Chef"" combines his talents. Not only does he star but he he wrote an amazing script and directed flawlessly. Every performance in the film is top notch from Favreau to Emjay Anthony as his son. Favreau called in some of his Avengers (Robert Downey Jr and Scarlett Johansson) for small parts and added stars like Dustin Hoffman, Sofia Vergara, Oliver Platt, Bobby Cannavale and John Leguizamo. Leguizamo has a lead role and was never better. Even Vergara, who seemed to be a one trick pony in ""Modern Family,"" gives an outstanding performance and shows she's capable of much more depth as an actor. It's to Favreau's credit that he got so many top actors to participate, even in small roles, and got great performances from everyone involved.This movie won't be everyone's cup of tea because it's not an action film, not a love story and not a riotous comedy. But it is a very interesting story about interesting people that feels real and makes you feel good after watching it. I initially didn't expect to like it but ultimately found it to be one of the most enjoyable films I've seen in a long time."
" Thoroughly enjoyed this movie
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,9,"If you like food, family and a great story you will enjoy this movie. This film starts with a Chef at a trendy restaurant who cooks for the joy of cooking and through some crazy circumstances has to start over while trying to figure out how to be a good dad to his 10 year old son. What follows is a great story of redemption, good food, great friends, family bonding and a road trip that you just have to see to appreciate. Favreau is a guy you just find yourself rooting for and Sofia Vergara is just darling in the role of his ex-wife. John Leguizamo plays the role of his best friend and portrays the kind of friend we all could hope to have. Just a thoroughly enjoyable movie to watch."
" ""I think there's something dead in there.""
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,5,"This film left me with a real indifferent feeling, I really couldn't warm up to any of the principal characters. I guess it's because Jon Favreau didn't really exude a personality that made you care for him as the head chef of a restaurant who gets into a Twitter war with food critic Ramsey Michel (Oliver Platt). Flying off the handle the way he did over a bad review of his menu, combined with an unfamiliarity with social media, turned his entire world upside down to the point of getting fired and submitting to his ex-wife's (Sofía Vergara) suggestion to operate a food truck. I don't know about anyone else, but if I had been offered a vehicle in the condition that 'El Jefe' first arrived in, I would have turned it down flat. It was just a monstrosity that no amount of hard labor could have turned into the gleaming food truck it wound up being. But that's what the script called for, so Chef Carl (Favreau) and his son Percy (Emjay Anthony) made it happen against all odds. On the flip side however, I did admire what a talented chef could produce in a day's work; the dishes Carl prepared not only looked delicious but appeared absolutely stunning. So while giving in to his ego, Carl gave up a lucrative and professionally satisfying gig in order to salve his self esteem. That it allowed him to rekindle a relationship with his son was about the biggest positive takeaway from the story, which when all is said and done is the most important thing. But had he kept his head on straight the whole while, he probably could have had it both ways."
" Great film
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,9,"Chef is about a chef who is struggling in his life. Between being unhappy in the work place and failing to please his son, he leaves his kitchen in hopes of starting a food truck business where he can unleash his passion for cooking, freely. This film was great. Jon Favreau really knocked it out of the park with this great story, characters you can connect with, and beautiful direction and editing. It all really felt grounded in the real world except for the over reliance on social media. It was to the point that not long from now this film will feel outdated. Now, I don't mind it all when it's necessary, which in this film it sometimes is, but there were so many instances that used social media that really didn't need to be there and they felt almost awkward. Not only that, they had to add to it by putting text of what they were typing on the screen along with the Twitter bird flying around in the air. All of this was really bothersome to me and I feel that if they toned it down and had removed the text, the film could've been about perfect. That being said, all of what I loved about this film drowns out my negativity. There's so much to enjoy and it's a really fun watch. I rate Chef a 9/10."
" A Wonderful Movie for Just About Everybody
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,9,"A great narrative about male bonding outside the bull***t requirements of ""caper"" movies like Oceans Eleven.
You may find it to be a little unbelievable that this guy has women in his life who look like this - but, as writer-director - you have the option of casting hot women (Woody Allen's been doing it practically his whole career).
What is believable: that Jon Favreau is a chef de cuisine, and has almost a religious attachment to food and the part that it plays in the quality of life for many people.
Also welcome: his speech (about 38:00) about the necessity of ""excellence"" in life.
If you're going to play, put your whole self into the game.
I think this is the kind of speech that every father should be making to his kids.
There is absolutely no downside to this movie, and it's still entertaining even after repeated viewing."
" Chef
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,10,"I really Loved this Film it was very well done. The Young Actor in this Film that Played the Son did a Wonderful Job. That one part when they were giving the Food away for Free. The Father pulled him away and had a Talk with him. NO MATTER WHAT it is our Job to give the Best Food out because it's our Job. So DO NOT GIVE OUT THE BURNT FOOD SON. Then he found out his Young Son was Advertising on the Computer as they Drove City to City on our Way. The Best Food on its way then his Father found out. It kind of Blew his Father and Friend away. His Father put his Little Boy in charge Plus making Foods. It was kind of like Old School. It reminded me when I grew up. As a Kid we all Worked Hard and we Loved it. I am 48 now and when I was a Kid growing up. Oh my god I worked every summer at Fairs, in Fields and Baseball Feilds. With my Grandfather and I Loved it."
" GREAT MOVIE
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Absolutely a great movie. Great story line, great acting, and plenty of famous actors all contributing to an awesome film!"
" Favreau brings the Flavor
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,8,"Chef tells an amazing story of a father struggling to build a relationship with his son while working hard to keep his dreams alive as a famous chef. John Leguizamo, Sofia Vergara, Scarlet Johansson, Robert Downey Jr., and Dustin Hoffman all deliver awesome performances here. However, the real incredible work comes from Favreau and Emjay Anthony, who plays his son in the film.Favreau has a way of creating incredible dialouge that offers both depth and humor at the same time, creating a sense of trust with the audience. This movie made me laugh a lot but it also allowed me to dig deeper into these characters as the film progressed. I loved the simplicity of the story that also allowed it to actually be quite powerful in the end.If you continue to follow what you love with who you love, you will be able to acheieve real success in your life. I'm not talking about wealth or power, Im talking about happiness. If you allow yourself to be controlled by the opinions of others, you will never be where you want. Chef was unique, fun, and heartwarming. Its a movie I believe everyone can enjoy."
" A Satisfying and Heartwarming Story
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,"I'm upset that I am seeing this film for the first time in 2021. Where have I been?!? I am lover of movies that show the viewer raw natural emotion but toss in a dash of the dramatic, and this story is precisely that. If you want to watch a film with an accurate portrayal of real people, this movie is perfect. There is an amount of predictability that satisfies you to your very core and this movie, for me, gratified every inch of me throughout the entire film. The theme of finding your true passion in life and what truly makes you happy, to the theme of prioritizing the love of your family, collide in the most compromising and heartwarming way that put me to tears a couple of times in the movie. Will definitely be rewatching this again for the third time very soon and I'm happy to give this a 10/10."
" One of the Greatest Movies
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,10,"This movie is one of my all time favorites. It has it all. Comedy, heart, romance...everything. Jon Favreau sure knows what he is doing!"
" I loved it...
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,10,"I love food, I love to cook and it was just a feel good film... I've gotten in Jon films more lately as an actor rather then director. I knew of him as Tony stars buddy and Director on many films... Until I started watching a bunch of Vincent Vaughan films then going backwards when they was in films back in the early days and Jon was the lead, not the 2nd or 3rd banana.... I can't believe how much he has altered, if he kept that body and way he looked he certainly could of played a marvel hero himself... He can act and direct and he should get more credit. GREAT effort on this one, great atmosphere...."
" I didn't want to fall in love with this film
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,10,"But I did. It rather sneaks up on you as you realize it's like a real-life chef and the reason is due to Favreau's attention to detail and coaching from chef Roy Choi, who joins him later in The Chef Show (which I'm also hooked on, while I'm again watching Chef right now). This movie is golden, I love all the characters especially John Leguizamo and Sofia Vergara. Favreau brought out an excellent nuanced performance from her that is a refreshing change from her Modern Family character."
" This movie was made for me

" A favorite and the soundtrack helps
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,9,"Classic story of burning bridges, father/son bondings and...a food truck. Okay this movie is more than just that. It is a collaboration of many great actors helping a friend make a great movie. The movie is about the pressures of being creative and when all of that fails, rebuilding and bonding with the family you put to the side. All the while in a food truck traveling from Miami to L.A."
" Great Feel-Good Movie
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,10,This is a fantastic Father and Son bonding story that brings very real cultural pride with it. The locations that scenes were shot truly capture the culture of the areas. This is a fantastic story that I will definitely be rewatching. This movie makes you smile
" What a delightful, menschy film!
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,9,What a breath of fresh air. I loved Jon F. And his sidekicks. And the loving friendships among the men. And of course the way Jon related with his son. And the music! And the food! Just mmmmmmmm.... Thanks!
" Enjoyable
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,8,"A very enjoyable film, fun storyline, great acting, and an amazing soundtrack. Loved the journey and genuinely felt invested in the characters and story."
" Simple yet enticing, emotional yet full of happiness. Jon Faverau is a genius
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,9,"If you like food and are interested in it, you'll surely love this movieWe don't usually get movies like this these days. I've liked everything Jon's ever worked onThis hits home. It has that old feeling when movies were about having fun and good endings. It's simple, it's interesting.It doesn't feel too cold either, it's engaging, it's intense"
" Straightforward good time
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,7,"This film is a good, positive watch with no extra baggage. It stars Jon Favreau as a temperamental chef who is feeling restricted by the commercially minded and stubborn restaurant owner (no doubt channeling his inner frustration at the Marvel franchise). This all blows up when he starts some drama with a famous food critic, leading him to reconsider his life and start a food truck. He feels like a real person with a fleshed out life and personality, trying to do his best for his ex-wife and son. The moments when he bonds with his son are very uplifting and we are happy for their happiness. My only criticism is that their success is too idealised and it moved too quickly into ""happily ever after"" territory."
" My name is chef
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,10,This movie is what made boys into men and men into gods
" Amazingly good movie.
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,9,"When I first heard about this movie, I knew that I need to watch it. Stood on my ""watch list"" for like 4 days, finally saw it today, loved it .. was amazing, but somehow the ending was not good for me, because in my opinion the movie ended up way too soon. When those 3 were on wave and that little ""i love you"" thing happened on the phone, and they simple chosed to end the movie that way, I think that if they would've want they could put an extra 30 minute easy. But still, a great great movie. You'll love it, even if you dont like to cook and stay in kitchen. :)
So yea, thats way I didnt gave 10/10 ... the ending felt incomplete in my opinion."
" Brilliant Film
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,10,"You cant go wrong with the amazing Jon Favreau. A brilliant all rounder, and to bring His Marvel co stars with Him in this film was priceless. Loved the story and enjoyed every minute. MUST WATCH!"
" Great, great movie
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,9,"I discovered this late but thanks to the Netflix series I bought this without hesitation. What a great movie about resiliency and the human spirit, the father/son bonding and loyalty between friends really shines through on this one. I choked up a couple (5-7) times. Must watch...plus there are 3 marvel characters and Aaron Franklin in it sooooo..."
" Feel goooooood
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,9,It brings out the inner child in you and makes it happy. Great characters and beautiful food and music. Such a good one.
" Feel good movie with good message
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,8,"Have been contemplating for a while to watch this movie or not, at last decided and watched in Amazon Prime and it was worth it, message given in this movie is needed for everyone. Initially there were some confusions about his son's relationship with him and that got clarified only at the last 30 minutes for me, which was a minus according to me. Acting and direction of Jon Favreau was very good and Sofia Vergara too! I really liked the message of the movie - ""If you follow your heart/passion and your work touches/impacts others positively, then you will feel very much satisfied with your profession"" and I wish I follow this in my life. The other thing that I liked in this movie was, it travels across multiple cities such as Miami, LA, Austin & New Orleans and felt like travelling along. This movie might not be suitable for kids below 10, as plenty of bad words in the movie!!"
" Such a feel good movie!
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,8,Watching it always makes me happy. Absolute classic. It's funny and heart-warming with a great soundtrack too.
" A feel good ride
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,7,"This was a good experience. I am impressed with Jon Favreau. This is his first directed movie I am watching. After an initial lag, the introduction of characters and plots seemed a bit boring but then as the father son duo clicked it became a better version. The movie never had a dark element, it was smooth ride which is one other reason that I liked. There were some 2 or 3 jokes which were good but the movie was mainly on the father son relation and the cooking just a side dish.
Overall, I would say watch it if you are in need of some safe feel good movie, dont expect LOL moments or emotional moments, its just a ride a father and his goes on..."
" Ideal hang with the fam movie
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,8,"A father and a son each go through a growing-up phase together and end up all the better for it.
Smiles and lumps in your throat revolve in a swinging salsa rhyhtm in this ultimate foodie-feelgood movie. No special effects, no megabudget, just the visible joy of a group of professionals wanting to entertain. Interesting soundtrack with ideosyncratic choices and lots of Cuban influences.
Lot of cameos. And what a cast.
Jon Favreau himself, who has 'good guy' written all over him. Radiating Sofia Vergara, at her motherliest - even though her temperament may run a little too high for this movie (watch her shout down The Critic at the end). Emjay Anthony as a credible son looking for a father figure in his life. John Leguizamo ourdoes himself as the feisty buddy. Robert Downey plays the disturbed and evil brother-in-law with conviction. Dustin Hoffman is a credble asshole restaurant owner (much like the boss who fired him in Kramer vs Kramer). The list is endless."
" blogging to tweeting
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,7,"Includes a ""spoiler""Film Review on IMDB
The movie Chef, starring Jon Favreau as Carl Casper ends up being an uplifting story about the transitions a passionate chef had to make after losing his professional job. This movie included a lot of major stars that played minor parts including Scarlett Johansson as Molly, John Leguizamo as Martin, and Robert Downey Jr as Marvin. Sofia Vergara plays Carl's ex-wife, Inez and the mother to Percy who is played by Emjay Anthony. The acting was very whitty and vulgar language was used a lot, but hey that's what you get in the restaurant industry!
There were three themes that stood out to me: fatherhood/family, hard work and pursuing what you are passionate about, and adapting to the modern generation, like using social media to your advantage. Carl was a great chef but working for someone else's restaurant he didn't have the free reign to create what he wanted to. Until an accidental tweet led him to open up a food truck where he showed his son Percy the importance of hard work and pursuing what you love to do. Percy was able to flip the negative impact Twitter had for Carl to a positive one. The old traditional menu Carl was forced to make matched the blogging tired ways, blogging works, but Percy utilized social media technology to help grow and market their food truck adventures! Opening up the food truck and taking Percy along the ride helped bond the two of them together.
I really enjoyed the cinematography of the cooking scenes. The beginning of the movie, it was very cinematic and professional while he was still in the restaurant, like the opening scenes. One of my favorite scenes is when he was cooking for the hostess Molly while she watched, talk about food porn! The camera angles and lighting worked magically during that scene. As he transitioned to their food truck adventures, those montages became more fun and vibrant! Between the cooking clips, the food truck gang, the crowd, and the music...it matched the fun experience of having a food truck."
" Food Truck Frenzy
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,10,"I just watched the film Chef for the second time sense it came out back in 2014. I had forgotten how funny this comedy/drama was for me. This comedy depicts the pleasure of cooking good food chef's like us can have. I am no stranger to the love of food that this movie offers How hurtful it can be when someone you admire downplays or straight up talks unkind words about the food you poured your heart and soul into.
This movie has it all, food, drama, kids, and of course the girl. Filled with some amazing actors like actor and director Jon Favreau as Carl Casper. John Leguizamo as Carl's partner in crime since the good ole days Martin. Let's not forget about his son Percy, played by Emjay Anthony who just wants to hang with his dad and have a good time being together and learning from each other. Lastly, his ex-wife Inez played by the beautiful Sofia Vergara. If you feel a little jealous about him, well his girlfriend Molly is played by the gorgeous Scarlett Johansson. I wish all chefs were so lucky as Carl; when it comes to girls anyway. (Favreau, 2014)
Carl loves the food he designs so much, that he really does not have time for much else. Maybe this is what drove him to divorce from Inez who seems to still like him as a good friend that supports him and pushes him into new adventures with Percy after his dream career as a master chef is destroyed by a food critic. Carl wants to cook more than anything, so he goes back to his roots to start fresh. He wants this so bad that he is willing to put it all on the line and start a food truck with the backing of Inez's' ex-husband Marvin played by the one and only Robert Downey Jr. A somewhat eccentric and extremely wealthy man, he makes Carl suffer a bit before giving him a food truck that is trashed yet has good bones; possibly representing how Marvin feels about Carl. (Favreau, 2014)
The theme of this movie must be about following your gut to make your dreams come true even though that might not mean what you think it does. I mean in the end, Carl does not get the girl, but he does gain a great relationship with his son, and the restaurant of his dreams where he can use his creative genius. This gift comes from the man that once ruined him. In the end, it was all a misunderstanding between a critic and a chef because the critic knows Carl is amazing, he just wanted to get him out from his creative slump. (Favreau, 2014)
Chef is a movie so obsessed with food that it reminds me of a long time favorite of mine; Rattatouille released in 2007. This animated hit is about a rat (Remy played by Patton Oswelt) that has the same flare for food that Carl does in Chef. Remy is willing to do anything including letting a dishwasher boy take the credit for his masterpiece just so he can make people feel good through his food. Both movies use music to set the mood throughout as the soundtracks are brilliant. The director uses a subjective point of view with the camera throughout the film so that you can feel the immense emotions felt by the characters. Carl must find himself again while on a road trip to take the new food truck from Miami to California. In the end this movie is about finding yourself and relighting your soul through the things that you love. The only question this film left me with is; why do I not own a food truck?"
" Came from IDUBZZ and wasn't disappointed
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,10,I rarely enjoy a movie like this it holesome beautiful warm and alot of the time I was laughing from my heart love this movie 10/10 would recommend
" It's a Chef's Domain
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,8,"The movie not only portrays the passion of Carl Casper to the food but how it influenced his life and relationships. Before seeing this movie I watched another movie named 'Chef' in Hindi which is a direct adaptation of this movie shot in Indian Context. Comparing these two movies, of course, I do like the English version. I like the boy who played the role of Carl Casper's son (Percy) as he is the Kingpin of the narration. Loved the movie."
" Food truck.
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,7,The problems with chefs and the restaurant owners. The journey of him to finally express himself and make his life better; a better husband and a father. The bond with his child and the way he helps him in this adventure is great. The idea of food truck is good. The friendship which lasts a lifetime. The ups and downs of the life. Average.
" Very good movie for family
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,10,"It's amazing movie. Is a good history about a Cheff and father at the same time, and show how is possibly work and have fun in the same time."
" Find motivation when faced with adversity
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,8,"Chef is a great film! It's dynamic, heartfelt and clever. It avoids the dullness and lack of realism that usually overwhelm feel-good movies. It has rich character development and endearing wit. The resilience and infectious enthusiasm of the main protagonist is inspiring.
I highly recommend"
" Yes, Chef!
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,9,"Has all the right ingredients that's for sure! Everything that I wanted it to be, it definitely delivered. Got nothing more to say except that I needed this fresh inspiration to create! 🤘🏼"
" I want a cubano now!
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,8,Jon is literally combing his two passions (movie and cooking) into one place and he is having a blast hence the story and the acting all feel so natural and real. 😂😂😂This movie is truly a nice treat - I want a cubano now!!!
" Fantastic!
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,9,This was a such a feel good movie. I didn't want it to end!! I loved it!
" Hollywood comedy
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,1,A movie where someone like Jon Favreau has a girlfriend like Scarlett Johansson and an exwife like Sofía Vergara. This is believable like the wizard of oz.
" One-Line Review: Chef / Timeless Feel-Good Comedy / 7 Stars
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,7,"Chef is a nice little cosy film about food and father-son bonding that you can repeatedly go back to without feeling an iota of boredom in any of the viewings because that is the heart that Jon Favreau has put, charged with great shots, cool music, and happy performances. TN."
" Happy and inspiring
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,10,"This is a 11, amazing movie!!! Didn't want it to end!!!!"
" Drivel - couldn't get to the end.
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,2,So he writes the script - directs it - stars in it and surprise casts two hot women to be in love with him.Plot is awful. Characters one dimensional at best. He is a better chef than he is Writer Director Actor. He should stick to making sandwiches on the food truck.Don't watch.
" Joy to watch
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,7,"What a joyful film, with characters you root for, and a soundtrack to move to. The setup is perhaps a little long, but once the road trip starts the story goes from strength to strength."
" After the film you'll crave Cuban sandwiches...
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,8,"Whether you like John Favreaus work or not, he gives his all in this movie.This movie is realistic and the characters never felt like they were reading a script, the actors seemed to work off each other naturally with improv.This is also a compelling story, I genuinely cared about the relationship between Carl Casper and his son. This movie is also funnier than I expected, mostly coming from character interactions.And the food... The food in this movie looks gorgeous. It's obviously a big part of the film and the way the food is depicted makes your mouth water. Your going to crave Cuban sandwiches after this movie is over.The few flaws with the movie is some of the pacing of the second half of the movie could be better. And I didn't really care about the Twitter references. I know Chef Casper can be full of himself in the beginning but him not being able to work Twitter was out of place and stupid.Overall, I was impressed with this movie and I would love to see Favreau tackle smaller movies like this. I would be more interesting in that than another Disney product (although the mandalorian is good). The fact that he can juggle direction, script, and a starring role in one movie and making it work well shows how dedicated he really is."
" Ok
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,6,It rolls along based on Chavreau and the supporting casts charm..... and that's about it. It is paper thin. Leiguzamo is very good and the food looms incredible.
" A good feel good film!
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,7,"Let me start off with the talented cast. Jon Favreau is great and to see people like Robert Downey Jr was great too. Nonetheless this is about a chef who got into a fight with a famous food critic, making him lose his job after he couldn't take the critisim, but then found his passion elsewhere at a food truck. Along the way father and son start to bond really well, as he previously couldn't due to his work. This and the very happy ending this film got were lovely to see. A great build up to a great finish to say the least. I recommend this film for sure."
" CHEF'S RECOMMENDATION:
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,7,"Who doesn't love a father-son reconciliation story? so here we have yet another one, the switch is it's set in a food truck, but don't worry, all the requisite cliché's are still there.
Favreau's a classic Jimmy Stewart figure here, and acquits himself well. . Oliver Platt is fun in a couple of significant scenes, RD JR's short cameo is at his crazy best for a brief moment. rest of cast is perfectly fine. Otherwise it's that same ole father-son bit, but with a Cuban sandwich, which, though delicious, is not enough to lift this above the usual tired maudlin' ""feel good"" everyday.
Intro of intricate preparations and exquisite presentations of an array of familiar current better restaurant offerings is beautiful to behold, and will make foodies drool.
Superspectacular soundtrack! really the best thing about this project,
My suggestion: watch the beautiful foodie intro, then turn the picture off and listen to el ritmo, checking back into the picture for scenes of Favreau with anybody but the kid, unless you want to risk sugar-shock from the treacle. Do that and you'll experience the best of Chef
grudging 7, should be 61/2, or even lower if not for Favreau's honest and affecting portrayal
but soundtrack gets a 10!"
" Tasty Little Morsel
",2020-04-08 00:00:00,7,Upbeat feel good movie with warm performances from John Favreau and supporting cast. Make sure you have eaten well or have good food within reach when you watch it as the first 30 minutes in particular will make you very hungry! Great soundtrack as well.
" Underrated Gem!
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,10,"The leading man (in fact my man) Jon Favreau is hilarious! I really love to see him on the screen but once i log on IMDB, I saw that he is the director as well! OHM...this is really great movie and John and Emjay adds too much things. Kitchen of the movie is fullfilled with talent, vegetables and senses. Today was a good day that's because I saw this moive! Thanks Jon, I really aprreciated with every seconds of the movie! 10/10"
" Favreu's try hard comedy
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,1,"Man, this was cringey. Favreau wants to be Spanish so bad."
" A great Humanism story
",2020-03-13 00:00:00,8,"This film is pretty cool. Realistic, and Hillarious.Karl, who failed chef's story is giving us to lot of messages and moving humanistic story.The message of movie is 'How the SNS is effective' and this metaphor is keep using at the end of movie.Karl's fail is happens twitter.
Karl's successful return is also twitter.
And Healing relationship with Karl and his son.So, this metaphor is straight through whole the film. And...it's cool. Great metaphor and a well-knit plots mixes and makes great synergy.People who loves Humanism story, that would be love this film."
" It's the movie equivalent of comfort food
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,8,"Chef'Chef' is a warming road trip movie that touches the heart and stomach whilst tantalising the saliva glands.
I dare you not to go make a grilled cheese sandwich after watching this movie.
Jon Favreau is charismatic as ever as he plays down on his luck Chef Carl Casper. It's nice to see him take time out from directing those mega budget blockbusters he's now famous for and doing something low key.
Not to say that 'Chef' isn't utterly entertaining.
This movie relies on great characters and good old storytelling. There's not a glimmer of CGI anywhere in this film.
All that delicious food is real and it's fantastic.
Favreau even drafts in his Marvel buddies Robert Downey Jr and Scarlet Johansson for support with also a rare appearance by Dustin Hoffman.
That said it's the relationship between Favreau and young Emjay Anthony as father and son that carries this movie.
Along with the always brilliant John Leguizano as they tour the country in their food truck dishing out delicacies.
'Chef' is an easy movie to watch. It's like comfort food. Something you'll eat up after a hard day at work."
" Excellent!!
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,9,"Masterpiece, the music, the combination of Miami life style and urban, typical and conventional living, make you feel like you know the places where they go and you can almost taste the food (and that's what the movie is about)... make you feel hungry and make you feel like going straight to the kitchen and try to cook something...
must Watch!!"
" Wow, what a disappointing movie!!
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,5,"I was really disappointed by this because it had such high marks on Rotten Tomatoes. Really bad script. So ridiculous and predictable and poorly written. Basically, this movie is a vehicle for some very talented actors to perform (some with small parts), as well as to showcase well-edited food-preparation and presentation scenes. That's it. The acting is great, and the food prep scenes are gorgeous and mouth-watering. But the story and the script are just horrible! Like it was written by a 12-year-old. These fine actors deserved better."
" Beautiful time
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,10,"This is a beautiful time, just a great film :D Everything that is good about life is in this movie. It's a beautiful love letter, just full of great, big heart. Put a great big smile on my kisser."
" Late to party...great flick
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,10,Don't remember seeing previews for this. Great movie from the perspective of divorced parents being adults and doing the best for their kid. Love the follow your dream and do what makes you happy. Even though you may be at job you hate...either make change to another job or at the very least have things outside of work you love. Life is short...make the best of it...clearly this movie was made during Avengers filming which makes it funny too.
" Narcissistic Fantasy
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,1,"The movie tells the story of a self-obsessed man-child who ultimately prevails by having everyone in his life feed his narcissistic fantasy without him ever having to engage in introspection. The Chef loses his job because he throws a temper tantrum and then plays the victim. His relationship with his estranged son is patched when his son enters the Chef's world. The Chef never has to show any interest in his son's life or interests and doesn't. His ex-wife (who is out of league but that is appropriate when remembers this is a fantasy film) comes back to him when he achieves success because the world recognizes his greatness. There is nothing wrong with fantasy, but when it serves self-absorbed egos it is gross."
" Beautiful movie!
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,9,"This is more of a story about father and son than it is about chef and food. Sure the movie has food porn in it, but this is really a warm, heartfilled movie and Favreau delivers!Firstly John Leguizamo is looking great; whatever you're doing Papi keep it up! Then there is Dustin Hoffman as the restaurant owner and Scarlett Johnhanson, smashing!Can't say enough good things about this movie!One star removed because they went to Austin for BBQ. I thought this cheap, unthoughtfull, sellout part of the film."
" A gem of a film
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,10,"This was NOT comedy as it was classed as being it was LIFE! the good, the bad, a few cliches to make it film worthy and an all round wonderful film. The father son bond was awesome, and the work put into it was clear as day. I'd been putting off watching it for a while, so glad i finally did! It's more an 8 then 10 yet as true film makers are almost non existent nowadays it's a def 10 compared to the now projected as 'film'. very good film."
" Supremely enjoyable
",2020-01-14 00:00:00,8,"It was nice to see Jon Favreau take a break from blockbusters to make a smaller, more personal film with Chef. His direction shines through with plenty of great shots of delicious food and lots of personality. The actors seem to be having fun and it's pretty contagious. Chef doesn't the most original story out there, but it's simply hard to resist its infectious spirit and solid filmmaking."
" Starts off strong...
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,4,"But as it progresses the whole thing falls apart and gets way too cheesy. There's Zero conflict in the later half, boring characters, and just too sentimental for my taste."
" Nothing new
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,4,"I found this formulaic but OK. There seem to be no end of movies about the ups, downs and ups of various cooks. This brings nothing new to the table and is one of the less convincingly endearing ones out there."
" LOVED IT!
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,10,Just a feel good movie about real life struggles. No major drama and a happy ending.
" Authentic, well written and acted, just a great watch!
",2019-11-07 00:00:00,9,"As far as cooking movies go this is definitly the best one out there. Its about pure taste and the enjoyment it brings him. It actually made me curious about getting back in the kitchen.Aside from the obvious food element, the storey of a father and son is really well put together. You believe the harddships and joy they go through.The casting is in point and the acting itself is great.I loved it! 2 thumbs up and 9.0 rating for me."
" takes a while to get going
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,5,"First its a prof movie, then a family drama, and then a lighthearted road trip. it was a little offputting, but it ended somewhat on its feet at the end. Some sloppy editing was noticable, but overall a good performance.5/10: didnt get much out of it, but its a decent movie."
" Fantastic
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,5,"This is a fantastic movie but I'm not interesting the films topic and this is just fantastic
Not writing not editing not director and not anything"
" Nice
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,7,"I can not think of any other movie with a chef as the main character that is so joyful to watch (with the exception of ""Ratatouille""). It is a movie to consider when surrounded by your family or your friends, especially if they are foodie."
" What a pretentious load of garbage.
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,1,"Oh my God, this movie was just a platform to show off. It's so up it's own wazoo, I'm surprised it even got a distributor. Jon Favreau stars as chef Carl Casper, an absolute whinge bag of a character. Right off the bat, you don't care about this guy. If that was the intention - bravo. Casper is obnoxious and acts like a spoilt little brat.I get the impression that Favreau probably wanted to be a chef in another life and that this is his own self indulgent fantasy. Chef is all probably an attempt at ""comedy"", but oh dear, it's not funny. The chocolate lava cake scene is just well... embarrassing.The supporting characters mostly pour honey all over Casper which just ups the pretentiousness meter. There is one scene where Casper prepares a plate of Pasta Aglio e Olio for Scarlett Johansson's Molly, who watches the chef with the utmost adoration as he flawlessly cooks the dish - which is effectively, sex on a plate.And so, in short, this guy leaves his restaurant after a bust up with a food critic and ends up in a food van - where he and his old friend/colleague cook up a storm with their self invented Cubanos sandwiches. Soon, people are queuing up around the block, the word spreads and Casper is seemingly redeemed.Again, this guy can do no wrong. His food is presented as manna from heaven. Give me a break!I'm sorry Mr. Favreau but this seems like you called up your Hollywood buddies and said, ""let's make a movie where you all kiss my ass and laugh at my jokes"".Chef tastes as raw in the middle as a badly made molten chocolate cake.1/10"
" Best movie
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,10,"One of my all time favorite movie, very good actors and acting, always puts a smile on my face :)"
" How attractive Cuba Sandwich was!!
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,7,"I thought it was a passionate story about tenacity in the cooking like the sports comic or a heartwarming one about the rebuilding a family. Basically I didn't get any information before watching it. However, it made me mindful about the social medias and the reviews system. This point was better than I expected.
Also, the cooking scenes was attractive! It looked tasty and enjoyable! And the actors learnt the way to cook by the professional chef in the ending credit.About the review, when you get some severe commemtaries, it can be helped. Most of the writers wrote it without caring about the creators. Or rather, it sounds strange that they're aware of the creators. But, certainly I have to choose better words carefully in your opinion. It's necessary to be prepared to get some heartless opinons when you launch something. Since I'm on the creating side, I need to be prepared myself, too."
" A Chase Your Dreams Film!
",2019-09-06 00:00:00,9,"As a food show junkie, I waited way too long to watch ""Chef,"" a film which mixes family, entrepreneurship, and our love of terrific cooking to create an immensely enjoyable film about staying true to our dreams. The terrific Jon Favreau is the frustrated chef at an upscale restaurant; while being an absentee father to his young son, he's forced to churn out too-traditional food by conservative and unflinching boss Dustin Hoffman. Ex-wife Sophia Vergara finally convinces him to create his own destiny, and hooks up Favreau's character with her first ex-husband (played hilariously by Robert Downey Jr.), who gifts Favreau a shambles of a food truck.Favreau's character and his son journey cross-country in it, and that's where ""Chef"" takes flight, further cementing Favreau as a great hybrid actor-writer of any era. The always-charming Vergara is immensely so here, and both are supported by a cast improbably loaded with some of the greats of our generation delivering typically grand performances (in addition to Downey Jr., John Leguizamo and Scarlett Johansson also share screen time).Ultimately, ""Chef"" is a wonderfully entertaining film; an engrossing, endearing, and moving reminder to chase down our dreams and (re)focus on family."
" a fair movie.
",2019-09-05 00:00:00,5,The food as well as Sofia Vergara made me really hungry. I don't know how I'm supposed to rate that movie without getting to taste.
" Lighthearted, very enjoyable for a Saturday afternoon
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,7,"Good vibes, good food, an endearing and mouthwatering insight into the world of cuisine - gives you ideas if you fancy cooking ( like me :)) ) and the cast brings spice to the whole. Good job, Jon Favreau!"
" A real feel good film!
",2019-08-14 00:00:00,8,"This is perfect for a movie night with the family, I think everyone will enjoy it. Most characters were loveable, maybe too nice sometimes, but overall the movie felt realistic. You expected more complications, but then, it was a feel good. The plot was a bit foreseeable some times but even so I enjoyed watching it. Watch it if you want a feel good movie."
" Amazing feel good movie
",2019-08-09 00:00:00,10,"Favreau delivers an extremely good movie that keeps you with a smile around the mouth the entire time. It got the really cool cooking sequences, a sweet father-son story, picture perfect music and great acting, to mention a few. The kid, Emjay Anthony, delivers a winning performance, and Favreau himself is delightful.This has to be one of my favourite movies as i keep coming back to watch it every year. Watch it now, you will not regret it!!!"
" Great surprise!
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,8,Stumbled upon this movie. Was extremely happy with the story! Loved the cast and the music.
" Fantasies are alright.
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,8,"Let's start by saying right off that Chef is a lark. It's about a father reconnecting with his young son and finding his way via a food truck on a roadtrip. If you're looking for something deeper than food , and a bit of heartwarming comedy, keep on moving. The morons writing multiple reviews that the movie is a Twiiter ad are simpletons who can't enjoy a film for what it is. If anything, it's a refreshing look at a chef who is blissfully unaware of social media, his selfishness as a father,
and how it affects his life and livelihood. Mostly, it's a fun, charming and well made flick about food, friends and family. Dig a little deeper. You'll find it rewarding."
" A excellent feelgood movie
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,8,"Ive just recently watched this movie, since ive heard about it non stop for several years. Now I understand what all the fuss was about, the acting was great specially from Favreau and Emjay Anthony (who plays the son). All the cooking scenes mixed with the music are mesmerizing in the way they go together, you can notice Favreau put some love and dedication in this movie. The reasonI didnt give it a higher rating was due to some pacing issues halfway through and the ending which felt predictable and hurried."
" I didn't expect that movie is sooo good
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,10,"Im home watching amazing prime,scrolling movies and seeing title Chef,im like let me see since im really disappointed in movie industry lately i expected nothing much from this movie but let me give a try,after 20 min im shocked,movie is like a good book i dont wanna leave the room pause just keep going ,honestly i havent seen better original movie in past few years,very warm very good i enjoyed every second of this movie its very emotional too great job."
" Love it!!!
",2019-07-18 00:00:00,10,"Great story, love Jon Favreau!!! I want a sequel!!!"
" By The Book - No Deviation
",2019-07-18 00:00:00,1,"Ex-husband estranged from his son that he gradually grows close with - check. Quits unfulfilling bland job to be his own boss because his old boss doesn't like creativity for some reason - check (ironic how the movie about seeking personal creativity is as un-creative as they come). Critic apologizes in the end and gives Favreau his own restaurant, who also gets re-married to generic bombshell who's too hot for him (i.e. the most standard eye-rolling movie ending) - check. Over-reliance on social media references - check. The movie is so uninspired even the title sounds generic and store-bought and indistinguishable. Movies should be about showing you something you ain't seen before, not something I can literally get around the corner from my house. Jon Favreau is a hack. I can't stand John Leguizamo - I know that's unfair to take it out on the movie, but whenever he's in something it instantly knocks it down. Side note: this heavily reminds me of the Bob's Burger's episode ""Food Truckin'"" (I wonder if Favreau lifted the idea) which was a lot more fun and creative than this waste of a movie. At best, it's well shot, and there are some nice to look at food preparation montages, but that does little to redeem this flat uninspired standard pedestrian exercise, lost in the faceless shuffle with all the rest."
" Everything you could want in a movie.
",2019-07-17 00:00:00,10,"Food, love, loyalty, family and passion. When Chef El Jefe ends up down and out, his ex-wife, son and friends help him restore his passion."
" Celebrity Chef Brian's favorite film ever
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,10,"Jon Favreau's best work ever. He is the writer, director and actor in this amazing heart felt moment in the life of a chef at a crossroads in his life. The realism of how the chef goes head to head with the owner and the reaction by the staff is spot on. I have been through many cross roads in my journey as chef. The passion for the food, for the staff and for serving others comes across real and hits home. The challenges with family life and relation ships says it all. A chef's life can get all consuming and drag us in because of our passion for the service to others and the passion for our craft. The art of food is now about how artistic the plates are but rather the flavors that sing to us as a chef that we just lose ourselves in and then we get to share that to others and see them enjoy what we truly love from our soul. All of this is in the film. Mr. Jon Favreau what was your inspiration to write this story and to create this spectacular film. I am a huge fan of your work both behind and in front of the camera and have enjoyed reading about your journey as an actor and in the film/ entertainment industry. This is the best work yet. The cast, the crew and the chef's that helped coach you did your vision justice. It fans the flame of my passion for the culinary industry and myself as a chef every time I watch it. Thank you for creating such a wonderful piece of work. - Brian David Robinson aka ""Chef Brian"""
" Fun movie for date night
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,9,"Solid movie, great character chemistry between everyone in the movie. Not a single character seems out of place."
" Delightful
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,9,A movie about food done right. The Chef Show on Netflix helps you understand the heart and thought they put into making this movie.
" watch the spinoff!!!!
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,8,"Really enjoyed this authentic story and the superb writing and performances. Jon Favearu (chef) and renowned Chef Roi (who trained him in kitchen skills for the role) have a new Netflix series called ""The Chef Show."" In the first 30 minute episode they recreate the Cubano, grilled cheese and beignets from the movie!!
They are fun and hilarious together with their guest stars."
" Truly the worst film ever made
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,1,I would rather stick pins in my eyes than watch this again.
" Don't see this on an empty stomach.
",2019-06-01 00:00:00,8,"To put it bluntly, Chef is food porn. And I mean that in the best possible way. To those of us that have a love of food and not just the eating of it, this is a movie you need to see.Jon Favreau plays a chef that has had enough of cooking other people's food. He wants to cook his food and he wants to do it his way. So he leaves his job, gets a food truck and uses it to reconnect with his son. Along the way he cooks some incredible looking meals, seduces Scarlett Johansson with some pasta, bonds with his son and generally lives his dream. It's uplifting and it's going to make you hungry.I'm not kidding about the hunger part. This shows food being made and every scene has you going, ""I want to eat that"". I tracked down the recipe John Leguizamo uses to make his Cubano sandwiches and when I made it, it was nothing short of fantastic. Even the grilled cheese sandwich Jon Favreau makes for his son looks like the most delicious thing you could imagine.Strong performances all around. Jon Favreau is a great actor and director. John Leguizamo plays off him so well. And of course the lovely Scarlett Johansson is lovely as always.This is a a movie with heart and soul and a desire to eat."
" Delicious!
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,9,"Food, Music and Good movie. Pretty much what keeps me going, all jammed in movie? Hell yeah!
I'm a bit late to jump on this movie but I'm glad I did when I needed a morale boost in life. People who wrote it off as boring should have seen a different movie or saw it when they had a bad appetite."
" Bon appetite
",2019-05-15 00:00:00,8,The movie is completely filled with emotion and passion. And the visual are very neat and natural. And the chef scenes are incredibly smart we can feel the mood of the film. It's an happy and delicious one.
" Great Movie that for some reason flew under the radar
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,9,"I had some reservations about watching this movie as I couldn't see Jon Favreau as a lead but with the star studded cast, I gave it a chance. What a surprise!!! He more than pulled it off. Great writing, acting and if you love latino musica, you'll really enjoy the score. AND oh the food... The story is believable, the characters likeable and it all wraps up with a feel good ending. Well done, I highly recommend you give this one a watch"
" Have you seen chef?
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,10,"I hvae seen the movie known as ""chef"" starring the worldwide famous actor by the name of ""Jon Favreau"""
" Flava!!!
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,8,"8.4/10. Favreau's clear passion for food is evident here. It gives a true insight into what goes into great food - passion, and free expression. The film is a tribute to that. I would've liked to see Carl kill it at his old restaurant before Dustin Hoffman pisses him off, but otherwise the film was feel good. Ive never seen a Dad resist his sons company so much, but I guess that teaches us work-life balance too! Martin's lines are on point.

",2019-04-11 00:00:00,10,"Chef is Jon favreau show all the way. He is the writer, producer, director and lead actor of this film. Its a story of a chef who after being frustrated when his boss doesn't give him a work freedom and having a verbal spat with a top food critic quits his job and buys a food truck which is given by his ex wife's ex husband. He travels all around with the truck,making sandwiches with the help of his co chef and son. His business starts flourishing and he improves his relationship with his son.
Jon favreau is perfect as chef. His body language and cooking is exactly like a professional chef. The son character is also good. But the icing of the cake is our favorite RDJ's cameo for whom you have to definitely watch this film. Also the various food shown waters your mouth. The last act where chef misses his son and calls him back is shown in a grounded manner without any cheesy melodrama. On the whole, chef is a delicious watch."

" How do you feel a strong advertising flavor
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,6,"How do you feel a strong advertising flavor? Twitter accounts for one third of the content? Then there are too few food passages, half of which are fast food like sandwiches and hot dogs, just a few dishes cooked by the chef. The music is good. Doping too much nonthematic content is like putting too much sauce in, you can't taste the original flavor of the ingredients."
" The food can be more tastier!!!
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,7,"SOME SPOILERS!!! BUT IT WONT SPOIL YOUR EXPERIENCE!!!
Chef is an awesome movie with a good
storyline. The acting is normal and satisfactory. Jon Favreau had done a great job in this movie. I was really excited to see RDJ in this movie(though his role was very small). If people thought that they are gonna watch Chef, it must have been because of this amazing cast. But the cast doesnt get that much screen time which the watchers really expected. Talking about the story, it is very simple and quite good. It explains the basic meaning of life. But some things are illogical and unjustified.
1)The movie represents that how a Father got close to his son. Well looks like they pressurized it, they had a good relation at the very beginning of the movie. Then the makers made it bad so that they can be on the track of there story. It was normal Father-Son relation at the starting too
2)People who have never even tasted the Chef's food, gathered in huge amount to eat his food like he was that famous. Well they showed a pretty good use of twitter(it plays an important role). But then i dont think it can work like this specially in a normal movie like Chef
3)The Ending:We dont see any gaps filled in the relation between him and his wife. She just mistakenly said ""I love you"" to him(thinking it was there son). And then whoosh, they got married again(they had divorce). They should have showed more about him and his wife. More talks, more scenes.
Well, these were the 3 things that the ""Chef"" should have added in his food, to make it more tasty. More enjoyable. Except this, i think it was all good."
" Who's kidding who?
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,2,"A number of reviews on here giving scores of 9 or 10 and if you read them all they seem to be very professionally written, I assume by the script writers or similar. This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen and over 50 years I have seen a lot. My wife and I are both foodies and thought it was going to be great from what we had read but no it was slow, boring and not worth the price of the Dvd. It went straight to the charity shop next day."
" Tasty !
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,9,"Delicious pictures, sweet story and hearty characters .
Its a perfect Saturday night movie to watch with a partner or friends .
Characters , relationships and the story develops nicely , and you will be given enough time to bond with the leads . Brilliant choice of music , mixed with beautiful scenes ( of both country and food ).
The last minute of the story could have been better , but to me it was acceptable considering that the rest of the 114 minutes of it was fun ."
" Chef - Big Thing In A Tiny Package
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,10,"Five Things That Make Chef (Eng) an Awesome Movie
1. The music:
Though the movie is not a musical, it has a wonderful set of numbers. Right from the word go. Till the very end. They have an earthy Cuban and Mexican beat to it. Utterly enjoyable.2. The story :
It has none of the trappings from the 'how to make a hit film' manual. Fresh. Straight.
3. The actors:
Forget the big names. Watch them for what they are doing. Each one feels real. Long time no see this.4. The food:
Ok. I am a foodie. And food is built into the plot. The food here looks good. And I am sure it tastes good too. Not one dish have I ever tasted or even seen.5. The climax:
A good climax maketh the movie. And sometimes a climax can be the downfall of a movie. Directors feel they have to make a statement in the end. bla bla. This movie ends. And I wanted more. That's how I can tell its the perfect ending. Remember to see right till the very end. I mean after the credits. It has a cute gem hidden.#chef

" Great film about what is important in life
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,9,I love Favreau and I love leguizamo and Canavale so I had to watch. I was very much surprised by the authenticity and story. Great film about spending time with your kids and close friends and family. Great story about second chances and doing what you love. I also love to cook for family and friends and loved the Gary Clark jr cameo too.
" Amazing movie and my honest favorite Jon Favreau movie ever
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,9,The movie makes you really think of how working in a kitchen can be stressful and involves lots of hard work and needs you to put away personal matters sometimes. Although there are many F bombs the movie seems pretty clean. I love this movie to death and really shows the true meaning of how cooking is an art!
" Delicious
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,8,"I got to see this a little late but so pleased I did. It's not a title that screams ""watch me"" but I recommend. The music, the food, Sophie Vergara, Miami, California, New Orleans and Texas - enough said. The film pops along at a steady pace, great dialogue, touching rebuilding of a father/son relationship. A reviewer had previously suggested, quite rightly in my opinion, that the movie is a metaphor for Favreau's own career - pulling away from the easy menu/buck and getting back to his true love. Really enjoyed this"
" a great attempt at a story about a great chef
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,9,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it shows you that you have to believe in your dreams. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting are really good also. All in all I would give this four out of a possible five stars.
" Sosososo good
",2018-10-13 00:00:00,9,"Some people eat to live, but Chef Carl Casper lives to eat. He has a talent for making delicious food and it ruined his life. His wife and son cannot live with him because he is obsessed with his success in the kitchen. His drive costs him his job in the end after a dispute with his boss. The movie follows his story as he travels with his son and best friend across the country cooking traditional Cuban food. Although some may believe that Chef is a superficial and inconclusive, the journey of passing on the tradition of cooking from a father to a son is captivating and meaningful to everyone, If captures the ""ups and downs"" of life and couples the sad realities with sarcastic and aggressive humor. 
 Since Christopher Columbus discovered Cuba in 1492, Havana has been a major hub for trading and historical enhancement. Different cuisines, from Spain, Africa, the Americas, and the Carribeans entered their port and influenced the native Cuban cuisine. . When Fidel Castro declared his country communist, their relationship with Russia, the world's bread basket, strengthened. Where Africa introduced plantains and quimbombo (a stew base made from okra, pig, and other vegetables), Russia gave Cuba foreign wheat products. The rich history of Cuban cuisine and the integration of different cultures and flavors the Cuban kitchen a place creativity, diversity and creation
The infamous Cuban sandwich, ""Cubano"", is thought to have originated when undocumented cigar and sugar workers travelled freely between the Florida Keys and Cuba. It was a popular cafe lunch for the immigrant workers and a play on the common American ham and cheese. Influences from America and Cuba are seen in the ingredients. For example, ham is an American classic while roasted pork is a staple in Cuban cooking. Before we saw the influences of different countries on food, but the ""Cubano"" is an example of two distinct cuisines combining to create a dish that is unique to both countries and equally enjoyed. 
For Cuban chefs, passion, creativity and innovation are necessary for a successful kitchen. For Chef Carl Casper, when his boss, Riva, demanded he cook a common and unchanged menu for a well renowned food critic, his creativity and hopes for a favorable review were squandered. After eating a 
""bland"" menu, the critic, Ramsey, insults Casper's cooking. The resulting tension between Riva and Capser cause the two to separate. Now unemployed he seeks help from his ex-wife, Inez, who is the primary parent of their son, Percy. She recommends that Casper spends time with Percy to mend their relationship that was strained due to conflicting interests: Casper's interest in the kitchen and Percy's interest in technology and social media. 
He also seeks help from Inez's other ex-husband Marvin, a millionaire, who gives Casper a second-hand food truck as a ""pity gift."" With help from Percy, and Casper's best friend and sous-chef Martin, they renovate the truck and transform it into a sensational Cuban food truck. The truck travels across the country, gaining more attention in each city thanks to Percy's talent with social networking. Percy and Casper bond while they are ""on the line,"" kitchen vernacular for cooking the food, handling the orders, taking the money etc. Casper gives Percy his first chef knife and teaches him how to make a proper Cubano sandwich. The scene is symbolic of Casper reconnecting with the personal side of cooking. While he worked at his previous job his wings were clipped and he lost sight of the meaning behind his food. Once he taught his son how to cook a Cubano, the tradition and the skills were passed on. Travelling in a truck and cooking with his friend and son rekindled Casper's passion, and innovation for cooking. 
The truck becomes so successful that Ramsey returns to critic Casper's cooking in a different and more creative setting. Ramsey raves about the food, and offers Casper a job as head chef in a new restaurant where he will have full control of the menu. The movie ends with Percy returning to school but working with his father in the kitchen on the weekends.
 The movie shows the personal side of cooking. When we order food at a restaurant we read the dishes and only see the words that are printed on paper. We rarely recognize that behind the words are chefs that have tested, altered, and created a dish that captures their passion and emotion. The art of home cooking displays love and care for the people you are cooking for. Although home cooking is semi-obsolete in the modern age, with the availability of fast food and delivery, the relevance of passing a tradition from generation to generation carries more weight now than ever. If the people of this generation do not listen and learn the style, technique, and passion of cooking the skill will be lost. Chef enforces the importance of passing on the tradition. It inspires those who watch it to cook, and experiment with food and share their creations with their close friends or family."
" Really really entertaining !!!!
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,8,"I really liked the story and the way everything was told , and the addition of music along the movie kept it fresh and really oddly satisfying to watch . 
All around great movie , the only bad thing I have to say about it is the end was so abruptly cut , before I knew it the credits started rolling in , apart from that really good movie ."
" Fun, easy entertainment

" What a cast!
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,10,"For a seemingly small, low budget movie, this one packs some heavy hitters. For anyone who has worked in food service, this is a great. Father-son, coming of age for both of them. The painful reality of the restaurant business. Great movie. Mix up some Cuba libres and enjoy the ride."
" Engaging, Entertaining, Feel Good treat one must not miss.
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,8,"Tone, Script & Story: The story is about a chef who goes to his extremes as a critic thrashes him in his review and further how it ends well for all.What I like about the movie: Critic to come terms with our chef as the movie ends. The father son duo as they accomplish some cherishing moments. Marketing skills lay down by son. Engaging, Entertaining and Feel Good plot.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The movie comes to us from director Jon Favreau who has given us Iron man, Iron Man 2, The Jungle book, 'cowboys and Aliens' and the list goes on. He also acts in the main lead. He along with factors (other chef, his child, food truck, etc) that surround him together put a pleasant show. Acting: Justified.Final Verdict: It is engaging, entertaining feel good treat no one must miss."
" A Recipe for Success
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,8,"When you think of great directors, you think of Steven Spielberg, Clint Eastwood, Christopher Nolan, Stanley Kubrick, etc. While he may not be at the heights that those guys are at, if Jon Favreau keeps going the way he is, he will be a legend soon enough.The best directors can direct just about any genre. Favreau has directed action movies (the first two Iron Man movies), adventure movies (Zathura, The Jungle Book), comedies (Elf) and dramas (Chef) - all of which were resounding critical successes. What makes this one interesting is that, while he is usually in most of his films, he usually plays supporting characters, but here he is, front and center, and he does a great job carrying the film. He is also supported by a wonderful supporting cast: Sofia Vergara and John Leguizamo are their charming selves; Oliver Platt plays an interesting food critic. Also good to see Dustin Hoffman and RDJ; even if their scenes are limited, they make the most out of them. However, the star who stole the show was Emjay Anthony as Favreau's son.The only problems that I felt the movie had was with two characters: those played by Scarlett Johansson and Bobby Cannavale. While I felt that both actors did the best they could with the parts they were given, I felt that their characters were severely underdeveloped. Once the plot of the film gets moving, you don't hear anything else from them, and I felt that these were two characters that we could've gotten to know more of.Nevertheless, this is a great movie and I definitely recommend watching it! Favreau has done it again!"
" Hell's kitchen
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,6,"Jon Favreau writes, directs and stars in Chef. I think he also had a hand in selecting the soundtrack as you get a few original versions of songs made famous by being re recorded by other artists such as the bassline used later by Melle Mel for White Lines.Carl Casper (Jon Favreau) loses his cool on the internet, a medium he has no clue about when he gets a dismissive review from a food critic. Carl wants to make cutting edge food but bows down to commercial considerations from the restaurant owner (Dustin Hoffman.)Out of work, divorced and middle aged. Carl and his son refurbish an old food truck in Miami and with his former assistant chef Martin (John Leguizamo) they drive the food truck to California wowing customers along the way with some authentic Cuban food.The story takes a while to get going, like many other 'chef' films, Carl is self absorbed, he can be mean to his staff and has little time for his son when it is his turn to look after his son. Carl his lucky that his ex-wife (Sofía Vergara) actually likes him and appreciates his culinary talents.The film picks up a pace once Robert Downey jr shows up for a cameo and Carl gets hold of the food truck and begins his cross country jaunt.Chef is an easy cooking film, it does not have much plot or tension. The music is nice but it feels like an easy starter than a main course."
" Decent movie
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,7,"Obviously, I'm a little late to the party on this movie, I just never heard of it before watching Binging with Babish on youtube make a bunch of recipes from it. I decided to give it a go after I saw his episode with Jon himself invited on the show.The movie's got a ""decent"" scenario, it's just a little boring.Coming in, I expected they'd focus more on the food, since it is supposed to be centered around a great Chef. Instead, they focused heavily on the relation between the father and son. Which is not a bad thing in and on its own! ...but a bit typical. I just think it misses a lot of opportunities in a lot of scenes where they could've expended way more on the great dish they presented and the recipes... but all we got was a more or less vague explanation as to how the ""lava cake"" was made.Where this movie shines and it REALLY shines is in the execution of the dialogues. All the actors are great, especially Jon Favreau and the kid. I don't think I've ever seen a play as convincing as in this movie, where the dialogues felt so real, as if they were not scripted at all but genuine and honest. Favreau had a real vision for this movie and he has a great talent for putting it into words and action. So yeah, I really loved the interactions in this movie.Overall, a small yet very interesting emotional ride."
" Happy movie

Haven't seen many US movies like this.A movie about friendship, live, passion, liberty and freedom.
Well written and performed.I only wish the real America would look like this
and not like this trumpish paranoid hell with shootings every day."
" A Complete & Heart-Warming Picture!
",2018-06-28 00:00:00,10,I was totally taken aback by the whole flow and story of this movie. The storyline is INCREDIBLE and the casting and actors were nothing short of PHENOMENAL. But what really hits home in this film is just the way this movie fills your heart. A broken family is made whole and a career once thought over is restored. This film just runs full circle. I LOVE it. I wish I could rate it over 10/10 because it deserves it. GREAT JOB. I really enjoyed this one!
" Great Movie!!!
",2018-06-27 00:00:00,8,"For a person who is so into food and cooking, this movie really got me hooked... the bast thing is how actors make the interaction look very natural... I loved how yhe lowest point in the movie was the beginning then it goes up from there!!!"
" Strong Warning: This flick will definitely make you crave for delicious food.
",2018-06-06 00:00:00,8,"Strong Warning: dont watch this movie without food nearby. Because this flick will make you CRAVE for burgers, pickles, beignets, the whole lot. I never watch this movie unless I have my refrigerator filled to the brim with sausages and pickles and hot sauce.Director/Writer/Producer/Actor John Favreau really made his comedy masterpiece with this movie. He is already hilariously funny as an actor in this movie, but as a director he had total control over this movie and that results in a really funny and feel good FOOD flick. It is all about the love for food and family. Both are celebrated in this story about a food chef who couldnt get a job anymore, after he verbally abused a food critic. To pay the bills, he started a foodtruck and became his own boss. The movie describes the succes story of this high cuisine chef that starts cooking REAL FOOD for a change, together with his 10 year old son. It is a simple story, but what makes it so special, is the fact that the guy is divorced and at first reluctantly brings along his estranged kid in the foodtruck, to work with him. The father and the kid however start to bond through their love for authentic cuban food. Sounds rather simplistic, but the acting and the jokes are really great. I often dont like leading roles for kids, because they cant act properly, but this kid is really funny and endearing.Lovely supporting roles by Dustin Hoffman, Robert Downey Jr, Scarlet Johansson, Bobby Cannavale, Oliver Platt and John Leguizamo. That is an incredible supporting cast to die for! And they all play hilarious roles. A picture for everybody who wants to feel good, and loves REAL delicious food. Especially recommended for fathers and their kids, because this movie really has got a love for family at its heart."
" Really good movie and different from regular fare
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,8,"Likeable characters, on topic and lots of foodie 'porn.' Leguizamo is always fantastic and the story line was really great. Favreau does such a good job as usual. Sofia Vergara is great!! The music is awesome and the cooking is enthralling. A must see!"
" TOTALLY UNSATISFYING
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,1,Very rarely can I see no merit in a movie but CHEF is such a movie. Favreau and his ex is Sofia Vergara! Cuban sandwiches and a food truck take him to culinary stardom amd financial success? The muisc is not bad but that is no reason to watch this movie. Give it a miss.
" A feel-(very) good movie
",2018-05-13 00:00:00,8,"I felt happy while watching this movie and after I finished watching it. The actors did justice to their characters. Very believable story and performances. The story takes us through a journey that the father-son duo embark on. A journey where their relationship with each other and with the audience matures and strengthens. Frustration, loneliness, love, all surface with deep authenticity. To top this beautiful movie are Sofia Vergara's accent and her smile. There is a guarantee of not getting bored while the family explores the intricacies of relationship through passion for cooking and the search for happiness. Irrespective of how you watch it, through a philosopher's eyes or through the eyes of a laid back engineering student, this movie will treat you delicacies whose taste shall linger for some time after the journey ends with a sweet note. May not be a must watch for anyone, but its definitely a movie that you will not regret watching and there is a fair chance that you will feel extremely content and satisfied.Thank you."
" I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING DEAD IN THERE
",2018-04-19 00:00:00,5,"There is nothing like a fun family film with a family message and a few F-bombs tossed in for the kids.Carl is a chef who gets hammered with an on line review. He gets into a Twitter war with the critic leading to his termination from work. Carl most go from being with Molly (Scarlett Johansson) ""will have sex for food"" to living off the charity of his still loving ex-wife Inez (Sofía Vergara). I wish I had his bad luck.Carl succumbs to his wife's idea of obtaining a food truck which causes him to bond with his son and other formulaic ideas to the point of nausea. The problem I had with the script and film is that it tried so hard to create a feel good formula film it seemed plastic and fake. The characters and situation never seemed real, which makes this nothing more than a substandard comedy.A mildly entertaining film.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Inspiring and Intersting

" Predictable, but tasty
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,7,"Is it predictable? Yeah. Is it Hollywood? Yeah. Is it disguised as indie? Yeah. But Favreau knows what he's doing. There's nothing wrong with enjoying a movie, a soundtrack and a little fun. Somewhere between Swingers and Iron Man, this movie came into being...and that is a good thing."
" Food Passion
",2017-11-17 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)Another food and cooking-focused story that is much happier than another recent release Burnt. Chef follows a chef who is fed up with being creatively handcuffed by the restaurant owner who is satisfied with an menu that sells well yet doesn't sell intrigue for a certain food blogger and his recent Tweet. The chef has a techie son who is a social media wiz and the Chef gets signed up for Twitter and fires off an angry reply. Cue techie kid vs non-techie father gags for the remainder. Will there be a social media firestorm? Will the chef find his cooking zen elsewhere? There is a secondary plot focus of a strained father/son relationship. Perhaps cooking will ease that strainhint hint. Overall, it had a very expected story arc yet felt happy and uplifting. Compared with similar recent food movies, it was better and happier than Burnt and had a tighter story than The Hundred-Foot Journey."
" top notch film
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,9,"This was a great movie about a chef (well played by Jon Favreau) who works in a restaurant and doesn't see eye-to-eye with his boss. (I wish Dustin Hoffman had gotten a bigger role in this movie!) He loses his job after he doesn't get a favorable review for the food he serves from a respected food critic, sends him a nasty response on Twitter which he thinks is a private message, and then a confrontation with the critic caught on video goes viral. His reputation in ruins and his family life damaged due to a divorce and a strenuous relationship with his son, he starts to rebuild with his team on a food cart. This features a good cast and excellent performances all around. It might draw comparisons to the Bradley Cooper film Burnt. I loved all the scenes of the food being prepared. Just don't watch this movie on an empty stomach! You will love the final scene.*** out of ****"
" Decent-not brilliant by any stretch
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,4,the movie was like a 2 hour long advertising campaign for twitter. Was quite predictable and monotonous.There were no parts of the movie that were actually exciting. It was mundane. the acting of the lead character was strained in my opinion and i believe it did not fit the role.
" A funny lunch
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,8,"I can start by saying that Chef is a simple, light and satisfying comedy that despite not having a great script, conquer you by the charisma of the characters and by the good vibe of the movie, which shows a recognized head chef, who leaves his job in a restaurant after having his creative freedom denied, and starting a new business outside of the professional kitchen, taking advantage to narrow neglected family ties. We still have great performances from Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr. and Dustin Hoffman, in this written, directed and starring Jon Favreau movie."
" A feel good , chef movie that includes all the things that u want in a Movie like this ...
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,8,"I always love movies about Cooking, because these kind of movies makes you to try new things on your own or forces you to taste all new kind of things.Chef does the second part better better than the first part. Story wise : It a predictable and feel good story line, it includes the main character who dreams to try different recipes and to enjoy himself. also trying to get connected with his son and also his wife. Some scenes will make you say wow that looks tasty. sometimes the movie brings small smile on your face. These kind of things Chef does it brilliantly. Acting wise: john favreau was good as the father/main character, the kid was good. my favorite Character was Martin (John Leguizamo) the friend of main character, he was funny. Overall: if you want to feel good or to enjoy 2hr of your life , then IMO this one should be on your list."
" Worth watching
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,10,"This movie was very well put together. The story is fantastic and draws you in. I don't think you would enjoy it very much if cooking / food is not something that interests you as this movie really does focus on that. It's one of those movies where for me i have watched it 2-3 times now and it doesn't get old. This movie has it all, drama, romance, comedy.. I'd highly recommend giving it a watch."
" One of the best movies i've ever seen
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,10,I am not surprised about the quality of this movie base on the actors. Words cannot explain how much I loved watching this movie and how many times I will watch it again. It is hard to get too in depth without spoiling anything but the plot flows smoothly and the roles were fulfilled with the right actors. I could not have asked for a better movie to watch with friends and/or in my alone time.
" Best movie in the history of time
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,10,"How should I begin. It's hard to describe what can't be described with words, because the truth is, there is no words to describe the brilliance of this movie. This movie is why life exist, it's the meaning of life. Let this movie guide us, let it be the light in the darkness. This movie is the best of all time."
" A bad example of a cook movie
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,4,"I will not start listing here all the goofs that the film makers left in the movie, nevermind the plot which i think is good but kinda screwd up by the details. You see, I thought that this might be a movie about a father that has problems with his ex wife, that tries really hard to reconnect with his son, a movie about a chef that tries to do his job that he loves but is caught up in the mess between an owner that wants only money and the ""food critics"" that want to be some kind of failed art critic, and that was what the first fifteen minutes of the movie tried to sell to me. After that is like they changed the whole film crew and wanted to finish it as soon as possible. It went straight into clisee mode and the father is simply explaing his feelings and problems, the son just understands like he is some kind of psichology major, his wife is secretly still inlove with him because why not, his boss just pats him on the back, the food critic actually loves him and everything just magically turns to be just fine. This movie is just fine. Not good, not bad, just a thing to throw away an hour and something of your spare time. Too bad...they actually god great cast but is wasted."
