" I have to counter the naysayers
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,10,"I wasnt planning to review this movie, despite previously rating it. I wanted to counter the negative reviews which suggest the numbers and therefore arguments are not gone into enough in this documentary. Firstly I guess that decision was made to not bog this down too much, after all it's a documentary and not a text book. Secondly and more imoportantly there are a lot of studies out there which support the data in this. The secret is not a secret anymore and I would assume the naysayers here just dont want it to be true just like the climate deniers. This is a really impassioned and well put together documentary and if the pictures and commentary on factory farming doesn't make you think about how you source your food or what you eat then there really is no hope. Oh and those philistines who say the body cannot sustained a plant based diet should tell that to the elite athletes who are."

" Interesting but also misleading
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,10,"Worth watching and raises a lot of valid and thought provoking points. If only they didn't have to warp the figures and try to push a vegan agenda throughout, then it would be beneficial. As it is, it will be widely seen as a vegan propoganda production bearing false figures. Some films do more harm tgan good. Most intelligent people can see that meat eating needs to be reduced and if possible replicated by manmade alternatives, but humans are not natural vegans and are not going to be convinced by this movie, with or without the duck slaughter. Manipulative interviewing by asking questions of people who obviously did not have the answers is not uncovering a secret agenda, it is simply promoting your own agenda."
" This documentary is for the wokes
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,1,"One of Murphy's lawas says: Intelligence is a constant, and like any constant tends to preserve but... population increases.
That is exactly the point. The 80/20 Pareto's law saying that 20% of any group would provide for the 80% only applies to medium size sets. As the set inflates the law is not valid, the normal distribution becomes a skew distribution and it collapses - see catastrophe theory - (if you're not a statistician, don't think of that).
So what does it mean? Put it simply, it is imbecilic to say that we have to cull the cows, pigs, chickens and resort to vegetables because humans are not designed to be vegetarians.
Not denying that a lot of methane is produced (although a lot less than the melting of the permafrost) the only viable solution is to cull down to under 4 billion the world population. As a result, there will be less cows, etc, not to mention that people also generate methane (fart) and their contribution will also diminish.
This thing of changing diet and start eating grass roots and cockroaches is stupid yet perfect for the 80% of low IQ.
But of course, this is a Google movie....."
" Globalist propaganda

Again losers who have nothing better to do but scream the word is at an end if we do not do this or that. Yet ever benchmark (year) they claim that has come to pass NOPE nothing. No end of the world, no deserts of seas, blah blah blah.Kip Andersen is a idiot."
" Another documentary based on fiction
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,1,If the director of this film looked into any of the other documentaries about fracking you would realize that the numbers of actual methane gas release from fracking is unkown. Because neither companies that frack or the companies monitor it actually test for it. Then you're not looking at who uses natural gas (consumers) and tracking it into the cities.So to put a number on it just makes you look like a moron.
" Eye opener
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,10,"I was so shocked that this actually was no about slaughter that i was not prepared to see...but about everything else surrounding this already gruesome fact. I could never find an explanation why I don't want to eat meat, eggs and all...now i do. Thank you sir. I wish more people recommend this to each other"
" Animal liberation as environmental action.
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,8,"Probably one of the most interesting documentary on the subject of environmental protection I've gotten to watch in years. the documentary is about the taboo of animal husbandry's impact on climate change through the three-fold of gas-emitions, deforestation and water polution. the film-makers cover the subject, the impossibility of any type of animal husbandry to become sustainable, as well as the unwillingless of NGO's to mention the subject in their campaigns. It then goes on with possible answers to the question of self-censorship, mostly through the legal crackdown on any opposition to the meat & dairy industry through the animal enterprise terrorism act. The soundtrack is by Keegan Kuhn a.k.a xTrue Naturex. In a sense, I also enjoyed the movie for bringing up environmental reasons to be vegan, which could help making sense to a lot of people for whom the ethical reason of not considering any being as properties, and bridge lifestyle change with social change again."
" A wasted oppurtunity
",2020-09-11 00:00:00,4,"There was an opportunity here to make a documentary that really examined our relationship with the amount of meat we eat and much is wasted. Unfortunately it was clear after the first couple of minutes that the approach to the documentary was going to be nothing but forcing the vegan diet down the viewers throats.It's not that this documentary doesn't raise some interesting points, highlighting how the amount of meat we eat impacts the planet. But when the documentary presents the only solution to these issues as being to go vegan rather than reduce the amount of meat we eat and reduce the amount wasted both in the home and the production chain coupled then it becomes clear that this is more a propaganda piece that a real documentary."
" An Important Film, Though Lacking in Ways
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,6,"The first thing that needs to be realized when watching this movie is that it has a clear agenda. That should, I think, be obvious from the title and description, but I think it is worth taking into consideration. This agenda is the groundwork for the direction and structure of the film and it shapes how all data and interviews are portrayed. Having an agenda is not a bad thing, and I am not using this to disparage the movie. In fact, quite the opposite. A clear and passionate goal is the purpose of this type of documentary. However, it can also cloud judgement as to what the audience deserves to see.The meat industry, especially the cattle industry, is the leading cause of environmental destruction and going vegan will halt or reverse the destruction of the environment. That is the main message of the movie and what they are trying to convince us of. Taking everything in the movie at face value, that would seem to be clear. So, if you believe in what is presented and care about saving the Earth, then the logical thing to do is become vegan. I am not here to refute the claim nor offer contradictory evidence. Instead I want to try to see what the film did well and how it was lacking.The message of the film is clear, concise and emotionally salient. There is nothing black and white about the issue and the creator, Kip Anderson, is unapologetic about it. He lays out what the issue is, why it matters, and what we can do to solve it. The movie is laden with environmental group leaders and experts that back up his claims and give us a grand picture of the problem. The film uses a dramatic score and powerful words to evoke a visceral response in people. And there is no more visceral image that that of an animal being slaughtered for its meat, so if you're opposed to seeing gore then you will want to cover your eyes (though I think anyone who eats meat should see it, regardless of beliefs).Instead of being fatalistic and inspiring hopelessness, this film should inspire us that we can do something to change the world. We don't need more doomsdayers, we need people who want to fix the problem, and Kip Anderson is certainly one of those people. Veganism is morally justified and is a worthy goal. We need these types of voices and this type of movie to bring us out of our dark funk and put us in a position to take action. Anyone who is anyone needs to watch this and the litany of other veganism movies out there.Now to the weaker points. The interviews are more than a little biased in favor of the cause. Not only is there some selection bias, but the editing itself. More than a few times the interviews seem cut at an all too convenient point making the meat advocates look foolish, or making government workers seem incompetent. Take the interview at the beginning about water management and the Save our Water campaign by the California government, for example. The structure of the shots make it seem as if these two men being interviewed are responsible for or oblivious to the issues being raised. What's more likely is that they are simply powerless to do anything in the face of bureaucratic nonsense from the top down. Yes, we can all do something to help by not eating meat, but it's unfair to attack someone who is trying to do something about it rather than nothing at all. Overall, the advocates of veganism are given drastically more time to speak and we hear their words more or less in context, but the other side is given little room to respond.The data sourcing is a bit suspect as well. The claim that veganism will end environmental destruction and save our planet is strictly a scientific claim about the world and needs data to support it. This film is filled with data, but the sources are a bit random. In just the first fifteen minutes of the film there are at least four major claims that would need to be backed up. Two of them are sourced, and two are not. Whether it was laziness or lack of reliable sources, it doesn't look good. Few of the people interviewed in this documentary are scientists, which is not a critical failure but would have been a great addition which lends the film much more credence. This is something that The Game Changers (2018) did a much better job of.Let's look at the big picture, the title and one of the underlying themes of the film. There is a conspiracy in the United States which makes it impossible to talk about animal farming in the context of climate change. Anderson makes some presumptuous claims in this regard. There is, evidently, a vast effort by the meat industry to silence environmental groups and keep any info about the meat industry off their websites. Half way through the film, the funding for this documentary is cut short, which is apparently the result of this conspiratorial effort (and not just because his producer ran out of money). These claims are damning and important, but seem to be given up three quarters of the way through in order to focus on the main message of veganism. Without any deeper research into the topic or evidence for it, it's hard to believe. As Michael Pollan says about the environmental groups near the beginning of the film ""I think they focus grouped it, and it's a political loser"". Whether there is a conspiracy aiding the silence or not, the more likely answer, as usual, is ignorance and the oppressive capitalist system.I fundamentally agree with a lot that is being said in this film. I want its message to be true, that we can save the world by being vegan, and I want the world to be vegan for an even wider variety of reasons, including the saving of the environment. This film will do a lot of good in convincing people to change their habits, or at the very least should make people question their beliefs. Despite the flaws, it is still worth watching and you will walk out of it knowing more. If you are vegan, use it as fodder for your arguments, and if you are an omnivore, then try your best to really internalize the message and understand it without any preconceptions. The core message is true. We are at a point of no return, and the choices we all make in the coming years will determine the future for the whole human race."
" I can do better research without any funding
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,5,"While I appreciate the movie for what it is, it's bit ridiculous to argue, in this Google-age, that the websites you know ""Should"" be talking about the issue, and then behave as though that's the extent of the information available. All I did was google the problem (why is no one talking about meat and global warming?) and you know which organisation IS talking about it? PETA. And that's just the first google result.Similarly, taking to ONE doctor who has lived a whopping 32 years as a vegan, to qualify whether a vegan lifestyle is sufficient - after the first hour exploring only the above - seems a little trite and unenthusiastic. In this instance the filmmakers did NO research, had no stats or journals to reference and basically took this one random guy's opinion, on the few patients that have stayed in his practice, as fact. Way to debate the question. Again a simple google (can a vegan diet sustain you long-term?) and in fact the results are quite unclear at this point in time but certainly a vegan diet does have some deficiencies.Then a brief dance with meat alternatives - no deep throat on production and long-term affects there either. Well, hmmm.I believe this is the right conversation to be having. I agree with the concept of the film and the relatable presentation of facts/stats at the end. But if the filmmakers apparent on-screen conversion is to believed, he really didn't convince me to blindly follow suit. And having started the ""conversation"" with me, I would give him greater benefit of any doubts (if I was a non-believer) if he had been as thorough and consistent on every segment."
" Relevant as Ever
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,10,"This film will knock your socks off in terms of what some are willing to do to! The film is brilliant and the information still so relevant. I recommend this film for anyone concerned about the environment, environmental racism, or climate change or just plain truth of a system not often seen."
" The Conspiracy The Meat Industry Doesn't Want You Know About
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,9,"In Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret, a condemning light is shone on the pollution of the meat industry and all of its wrongdoings; a light that has never been seen before, and one that managed to change my perspective on animal products entirely. Unlike other documentaries that aim to address the horrors of the meat industry, this film takes an environmentally centered approach, utilizing ethos, logos, and pathos to convince viewers to change their habits rather than attempting to scare viewers into complacency.
Released in 2014, this daring film follows the stupefying journey of aspiring environmentalist Kip Andersen, who manages to integrate a comedic tone while investigating the true major contributors to climate change. The documentary begins with Kip's background, and how he obtained his love for the environment, beginning as just a kid who loved to go camping. He continues on by citing his amazement after watching Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth. He describes the many habits he enacted with the intention of becoming an OCE (an Obsessive Compulsive Environmentalist) and doing his part to fight climate change, including separating his trash and recycling, changing his lightbulbs, composting, taking shorter showers, turning off lights and riding his bike instead of driving. But he couldn't help to wonder, is this really enough? It wasn't until he saw a friend's Facebook post containing the link to a study conducted by the UN, which found that raising livestock produces more greenhouse gases than the emissions of the entire transportation sector, that Kip was pushed to delve deeper into the topic.
The film proceeds to follow Kip through this inquiry as he interviews person after person, exploring how the animal products we eat reflect human exploitation of land, water, and other natural resources, as well as how these mistreatments contribute to not only climate change, but a subsequently bleak future for humans and the environment. While he manages to interview many experts and intellectuals that cite evidence that supports Kip's hypothesis, many claim to be unaware of these devastating statistics. From government officials to environmental organizations to corporations to farmers, none knew or wanted to admit that animal agriculture is the number one contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change.
At times slightly aggressive in their tactics, Kip Andersen and his fellow filmmaker Keegan Kuhn kindly interrogate those they interview, asking the hard questions that were evidently unexpected by those being interviewed. While this method may seem a bit extra to some, it succeeds in proving how little this topic is talked about in the environmental community, as well as exemplifies the corruption that runs rampant within the meat industry, supporting the main goal of the film to expose this. It is in this way that the film manages to target the ethos within viewers or appeal to their ethics and ethical responsibilities. A scene in which this is most apparent takes place later in the film. Kip is interviewing a representative from Animal Agriculture Alliance, a pro-livestock lobby group. He asks the representative as to whether the meat industry had made substantial donations to environmental groups, her answer to which was suspicious, to say the least. It leads one to wonder how trustworthy these organizations truly are and if what they say should be regarded as ulteriorly motivated.
The way in which this film was edited provides an interesting story-like plot for the audience to easily follow. The main character, Kip, and the development of his personality on screen provides an anchor for viewers to latch onto as he leads us through the series of twists and turns brought forth by the many interviews conducted. As Kip expresses his disbelief and sadness at the reality of the situation throughout the film, the viewer is left to feel the same because of this attachment to his character and his reasons for feeling this way, appealing to their pathos or evoking pity and sadness. This is seen in many parts of the film in which the current state of animals and resources which are being abused for production within the meat industry are shown. The editors do a very good job of inserting the right transitional footage at the correct moments so as to hit a sweet spot within the watcher.
The makers of this film do a very good job to keep audiences intrigued and informed throughout its duration. This is done through the integration of powerful statistics told via creative animated infographics. These, accompanied by fantastically depicted examples, ensure that the viewer thoroughly understands the concepts being told and its larger implications are put into perspective. It is in this way that the logos, or the reason and judgment, of the audience is appealed to; by backing up the claims of the film through concrete evidence and relevant anecdotes.
All in all, this is a fantastic film that truly puts the ethics of the animal product industry into perspective. While it approaches the task of converting the public to non-meat diets in a much less graphic and invasive way, it is also equally if not more successful at achieving this goal when compared to other anti-meat propaganda."
" Are you considering whether to become a vegan? Cowspiracy will help you start your new lifestyle!
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,7,"If you are sitting on your couch right now, thinking how cows and conspiracy theories are connected - Watch Cowspiracy. Or if you are considering to be a vegan or vegetarian but you need the ultimate reason to start this new lifestyle - watch Cowspiracy. With creative animations and powerful statistics, you will most likely be convinced to start a vegan/vegetarian diet and to throw your hamburger away while watching the documentary.Cowspiracy is an environmental documentary from 2014 that examines different impacts of animal agriculture on the environment. The documentary chooses to look into familiar topics when talking about the environment and climate change, such as water use, deforestation and global warming. The two producers and amateur environmentalists, Kip Andersen and Keegan Kuhn, have always wanted to live a sustainable life and decrease their impact on the planet. They have followed most of the guidelines and instructions from nongovernmental organizations such as GreenPeace, Oceana and many others. Among other actions, they are taking shorter showers, using water efficient hoses and LED light bulbs, minimizing plastic use, and buying organic food products. One day they find a scientific article that suggests a new primary source of impact on the environment that they have never heard of before. The article stated that animal agriculture is responsible for more greenhouse gas emissions than the whole transport sector; 51% of greenhouse gas emissions are from animal agriculture compared to 13% for the transport sector. From this point forward, they start digging into the topic of animal agriculture as the primary source of the negative impacts for the environment.Kip Andersen and Keegan Kuhn participate in dialogues with different nongovernmental organizations in search for more information, asking why animal agriculture is not included in the organization's values. After the interviews, the two directors make the theory that ends up being their conspiracy about cows - their Cowspiracy. Creating and releasing this Cowspiracy may possibly even risk their own lives in the efforts to find the truth.It does not matter how many times you see the documentary, you will be mind blown every single time about how the leading environmental organizations do not confront animal agriculture, the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change according to Andersen and Kuhn. Cowspiracy uses overwhelming statistics and creative infographics to suggest that animal agriculture is the primary source for climate change. The directors approach the environmental NGOs but none of them address animal agriculture as their first priority to solve climate change.The biggest disappointment from Cowspiracy is that animal agriculture itself is barely discussed. It would be a huge improvement if we could see the 'bad' guys point of view about the statement that their impact on the environment is twice as bad as the whole transport sector combined but in this documentary we do not dig into animal agriculture but rather poke or scratch their surface. As the viewer we really want to confront the 'bad' guys and see what Andersen and Kuhn are able to change by making this documentary. We do meet some american farmers that have grass-fed cattle and they say ""we do not think livestock have a carbon footprint"" and when confronted with the statement that supposedly 80% of the Brazilian rainforest is destroyed for cattle they say ""they (Brazilians) shouldn't be eating beef"" if their environment was not designed to raise beef. It is a brief interview where we as viewers don't really acquire anything and we are still missing the interrogation with the animal agriculture.The direction of the documentary is, in my opinion, slightly amateurish because we are just a fly on the wall in this documentary. We see the interviews from hidden cameras and some of the documentary is handheld which of course makes it more realistic but in the interview with the Natural Resources Defense Council Ann Notthoff starts giggling in the interview about cow farts and this disturbs the seriousness for the viewer. Andersen and Kuhn have the right intentions and ideas but with some amateurish scenes and with some of the creative infographics it becomes some kind of entertainment while they are telling their story.It is a documentary that tries to ignite something in the people that are watching it and it really works for the directors through their powerful statistics and creative infographics. After watching this documentary you might want to start their vegan/vegetarian lifestyle, or at least think about your own food habits. The NGO's are, of course, doing a good job, but the documentary is ruthless against the NGO's and really highlights the absence of animal agriculture in the NGO's values. It does not tell the full story from both sides which I think is the major weakness and on top the slightly focus-disrupting scenes result in a star rating of 3.5 stars out of 5.Cowspiracy might be harsh to the NGOs for being silent about animal agriculture while they actually make an effort to solve some of the other issues of climate change but the documentary however informs about a huge problem and might provoke some people to change their lifestyle to be more sustainable. The documentary may hopefully cause more science and focus on the correlation between animal agriculture, climate change and the environment.Cowspiracy (90 min) may not be top-rated in the aspect of filmmaking, but it would not leave you untouched by the conspiracy they are delivering right in your mind. The infographics will, without doubt, blow your mind and Cowspiracy is unquestionably recommended if you remember to be skeptical about the facts and do your own research before jumping to a conclusion."
" And there is more...
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,10,"A certain huge amount of the meat produced expires in the storage, and in the stores and are thrown in the trash in millions of tons every day. That is not counting the meat that expires in your fridge and then trashed.We are all in denial.Its only right in some way that meat and dairy consumption is killing us.
The negative health impact of eating animals is out of proportion. It is also the main way of making people aware and to act differently: if they only knew how sick it is making them."

" Great message, heavily biased execution
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,6,"I totally endorse the vegan movement and acknowledge all of its benefits to wellbeing, animal rights and efforts of reducing our carbon footprint.
I've seen this movie inspire a lot of people for a very good cause, to make the world a better place. I do however object to the way the movie tries to argue for its sake. It feels like the directors didnt really have an interest in laying out all the facts to the viewers so not to dilute the message they wanted to bring forth. This does however make it extremely hard to not get frustrated at how the facts are presented.
One of the earliest examples comes when Kip meets with the Water Use and Efficiency Branch representatives. These guys are quite obviously talking about the treated water that the cities they manage carry in their pipes. Reducing sources of wasted water, such as gardening hoses being on for too long or filling up your pool in a dry summer, is a major concern for them, as the water they can treat and the source of the treated water is finite. The water counted for the production of a hamburger is on the other hand a mix of many kinds of water, where fully treated water is almost never used one of them.
This biased and unfair reporting of facts is repeatedly made used of. All in all it makes this a difficult documentary to watch, despite its beneficial message. I therefore cant bring its score much higher than around 6."

" A Thought Provoking Yet Biased Documentary
",2019-10-24 00:00:00,5,"Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret is a 2014 documentary written and directed by Kip Andersen and Keegan Kuhn. Kip not only writes and directs but also acts as the narrator, as we see the documentary from his point of view.The documentary follows Kip, as he investigates the agriculture industry and the damage it is doing to the environment while looking for the best solution to this often-overlooked problem. The film also deals with the fishing industry, livestock grazing and conspiracies within the industry. It concludes that the answer to these issues is to adopt a vegan lifestyle and eliminate meat from your diet.While the documentary is undoubtedly eye-opening and deals with a vital subject, it is also incredibly biased. Narrator, Kip, is a long-time environmentalist and therefore I feel that he had drawn his conclusions on the subject before he began making the documentary.Cowspiracy does not offer any real counter-arguments to the filmmakers' opinions and is therefore very one-sided. This bias, along with the suggestions of conspiracies without any facts affect the credibility of the film. Saying this, I agreed with many of the points that the film raised and feel that it is an important documentary to begin a discussion.The film raises some eye-opening issues surrounding the beef industry that I was not aware of before viewing the film. Unfortunately, I felt that too many numbers and statistics were thrown at the viewers, especially in the opening 20 minutes. This overload of information made it difficult to process, even with the help of visual aids such as charts and animations.Despite these reservations, the filmmakers are passionate about the subject and have good intentions at heart. They try to influence the viewer with some hard-hitting scenes of animal cruelty. While these scenes can be very upsetting, they are essential as they show the harsh realities of the industry. The fact that it does not shy away from these elements is positive.Overall, I feel Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret is a mixed bag. While it raises several essential points, it is undoubtedly biased and could have used a more balanced narrator, who looked at both sides of the argument."
" Detailed Analysis of ""Cowspiracy""
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,10,"Cowspiracy tells the consequences of the consumption of animal based products compared to plant based dietary. What's more? It also mentions to global warming issue and how livestock worsen it. I heard this from Bill Gates for the first time and laughed him when he said livestock is much more guilty than cars in relation with global warming. However, I was amazed after I made research and thereupon watching this documentary reinvigorated my idea. Graphics is effectively used and statistics provided makes this documentary entertaining, educating and must-see!
I took a course named as environmental sustainability at university. I can honestly say that what we learned is clearly similar to the facts stated in this documentary.
There is something we call like ""footprint"". When you consume an apple, you also consume the water used to irrigate it, you consume the oil used to transport it, so on. When you eat something, next time think about ""how much might you be consuming actually?""
Holland has 17 million population compared to 1.3 billion populated India. However, a Dutchman consumes 7 times higher than an Indian does. Footprint of the Holland country is nearly close to 119 million people.
I went vegetarian because I want to eat safe and healthy. Seeing that vegetarians contribute to world just by choosing ""right"" food, makes me happy everyday when I go to supermarket. Everyone can do something to save our planet.
If you wonder about why many people get cancer in 21th century, read the researches and watch documentaries. Guess what? Animal based dietary is guilty for it !"

" Cowspiracy: A movie for sheep. Join the stampede!
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,1,"Cowspiracy, a movie with as many ridiculous calculations, cherry picked facts and fallacies as NASA climate ""scientist"" publications. The 8.3 rating shows that there are a lot more two legged sheep than cows in the U.S.. A cow drinks 1 to 2 gallons per 100 lbs. per day. About the same as a human. Methane levels during the Carboniferous period, when terrestrial life was most abundant, was about 10 ppmv vs less than 2 ppmv today. Using the same formula, I'd like to see how many gallons of water are used by a human being to produce 160 lbs of worm food after 70 years of life, and how much human excrement is produced each second? Too bad that no one taught Kip and Keegan that cow excrement is called fertilizer, and helps the grass grow.Here is a short list of simple inconvenient truths that all of the 3,000 published ""scientists"" who benefit from NASA's annual multi-billion dollar Earth ""Science"" budget, totally ignore:1. The world CAN NOT flood as long as Antarctica is at the bottom of the globe, surrounded by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, cut off from warm water from the Equator, with an average temperature of -40°! As it has been for the last 35 to 45 million years. The ice sheet is 2 miles (3 kilometers) thick, and holds 70% of the Earth's fresh water.
The North Pole on the other hand has had an average temperature of 0°C. Question is, if humans CAN cool the Earth, do you really want to repeat the Last Glacial Maximum of just 18,000 years ago, when glaciers reached as far south as Missouri, and New York was under a 1 mile thick sheet of ice?!2. There is no correlation between CO2 levels and average global temperature. Google Image Search Geologic Climate History CO2. What you'll find is that the Earth has been unusually cold for the last 3 million years. That the Medieval Warm Period (950 to 1250) and the Roman Warm Period (250 BC to 400 AD) were both 1°C warmer than today. That the temperature rose 1.5°C in the 140 years from 1740 to 1880, but only 1°C in the 140 years from 1880 to today. So the rise in temperature is subsiding, not increasing!3. Just like those who predicted that Y2K would lead to total technological and economic collapse, NASA ""scientists"" predicted, and even testified to Congress in the 1980s, that New York City would be under water by 2020. I'll pay $1000 to the first person who takes me on a zodiac rafting tour floating down Wall Street.4. The CO2 levels are currently at 400 ppm. At the beginning of the Carboniferous period, when terrestrial life was most abundant, CO2 levels were over 5 times higher (2000+ ppm), yet the average global temperature was similar to today, and well below the average of the last 500 million years +6°C.It only takes ONE scientific FACT to destroy a theory. In the instance of human caused climate change, there are numerous facts that profiteers who call themselves ""scientists"" choose to ignore, and can be easily found with simple Google searches. Just like religion, people pathetically perpetuate profitable myths for free. The church, and other sheep herders are the ones that profit.SCIENCE NEVER IGNORES ANY FACTS, EVER! and SHEEP NEVER LEARN TO DO REAL RESEARCH!"
" Must-see documentary.
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,8,"My Rating : 8/10One of the better documentaries out there talking about the effects of animal agriculture and consumption of meat products.Shocking to see environmental organisations and charities turning a blind eye to the toxic effects of the meat, egg and dairy industries.Eye-opening and an absolute must-see."
" Normally supportive of this type of film and its underlying premise, BUT...
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,1,"The abusive contortions of facts and outright ignorance of all alternative methods and views relegate this one to the propaganda pile. While generally headed in the correct direction, the filmmaker(s) constantly veer off course and over a cliff in their interpretations of various data. For folks interested in learning more about the origins of modern ""food"" I would suggest any number of superior films, such as Food, Inc. for starters. This devolves into a morass of half-truths and misinformation so completely that it just ends up making it easier for the industrial food apologists to point at stuff like this and claim foul. This is spin, and at its core, no better than the crap and junk science that the industrial agriculture CAFO proponents are constantly trotting out, so any attempt to assume the moral high ground comes off as being just as disingenuous. Sadly, they do make a terrific point in their exposing of the Evo-non-profits' equally disingenuous exclusive agendas. The irony, however, is that they are exposing the type of false narratives and distortions of reality that they themselves are equally guilty of throughout.Please bear in mind that this is coming from someone who is both an organic farmer for over 40 years, as well as being someone who is actively involved in working to help stop the proliferation of CAFO's in my own State, so I'm actually more in their corner than not, I just expect better from folks trying to support responsible and sustainable alternatives."
" Bang on...
",2019-03-24 00:00:00,9,"This film was very refreshing to watch and was set in a very informal, casual, friendly way like exploring unknown territories and people along with the protagonist Kip Anderson.
The documentary team has shown the lack of effort from prominent environment voices, either complete disregard or blatant ignorance fueled by meat production companies political power.
It has shown the outcomes and the huge amount of consumption of natural resources - water, land, food and it's effect on surrounding environment and industries.
Finally it showed what to do next. What's the next best step towards reverting this.All in all good documentary.For people complaining mostly the 2 reasons being 1. It's nothing new, we already know everything and 2. Film professing vegan propogandaThat's the problem, it's nothing new. All these data, interpretation and analysis is right before everyone's eye. Authentic scientific studies in peer reviewed journals all have found out the impact of cattle breeding for quite some time. You can give data after data, in colorful and more comparative analytics but at the end it's the same message - our environment is suffering. The film has shown that conclusively.About the vegan thing.
They have mentioned in the film to reduce meat consumption. But like Howard Lyman said how can you call yourself a concerned environmentalist with such half baked attempt. We should go full 100%.That's why it's imperative to switch to plant based diet. It has become a NECESSITY as the growing population's demand CAN'T be met by the cattle breeding industry. Rather than from palatability and lifestyle choice, it's everyone's personal responsibility to see the bigger picture and conform.
Also plant based alternatives to meat and diary products are coming up. I haven't tried one so can't vouch for any, but it's a good direction for people wanting to switch.At the very least try to decrease meat consumption drastically, if vegan isn't possible. That should be the least we should allow ourselves to diverge from the path.Humans can eat plants or animals. We are seeing what happens when we rely too much on animals/meat.
Plant based solution is the only other alternative."
" One of the Worst Documentaries Ever Made
",2019-03-11 00:00:00,1,"Cowspiracy is a terribly written documentary littered with inaccuracies. The doc provokes no emotion and frankly leaves a bad taste in the mouth.What this documentary presents as groundbreaking news, is really just basic journalism that says nothing more than: corporations lie, non-profits don't no everything and that animals are killed. There are no new facts being presented.In short, this is a terrible documentary that shouldn't be watched by anyone"
" A revelation
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,10,"This documentary taught me so much. It was shocking to find out how detrimental livestock farming is to our environment. In fact, it made me become vegetarian! I really can't recommend it enough. In fact, I believe everyone should watch it so we are more aware of the damage we are doing to our environment."
" A Must Watch
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,10,"If you really want to save the planet and focus on what's important this is a great head starter to your research, it focuses on a main issue and not just usual turn off your faucets well and take short showers to save planet earth, it's a huge eye opener and i'm glad i had the opportunity to watch it. hopefully someone else will too?

" You can tell who's a meat eater and who's not by the review rating.
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,6,"I'm going to review the actual documentary and not push my believes into it unlike a lot of the reviews I've read. I'm not vegan but I did find this documentary interesting, how it was filmed made created an invisible rope to pull me in and I sat through the majority of it without being bored (the last 20 minutes felt like it dragged though!).The main guy of the show Kip Andersen seemed very passionate about the subject, making me feel like he wasn't just doing the documentary to pass time or for the sake of it but to actually raise questions on the subject. Judging by the other reviews, it did spark a debate among people which in my opinion, shows this documentary to be a success in the sense that a documentary should start conversation and debate, if it doesn't then it's a failure. Touching on a subject that a lot of people are very black and white about, either agreeing or disagreeing.I'll mention why I've rated it a 6 instead of a glowing 10. The main part about this doc that got me was the very bold statements they made with out-there stats and shocking one liners (most likely to get the viewers attention) but for me, there was a lack of evidence supporting this. Don't get me wrong, I'm not arguing the stats are wrong but I'd just like to see where they have come from. A doc should always dig deeper in my view, delving in to the evidence and showing how it reaches a conclusion but with this, it feels like one study or article surfaces and all of a sudden these stats come up on my screen and I'm suppose to believe everything I watch? Hmm I don't know. I know that they interviewed advocates on both sides and in that sense, did make it sort of balanced which I like but the last 15 minutes did feel like they were preaching slightly on veganism and there was one thing said by one of the people that raised my eyebrow which was basically, that if you arent a fully pledged vegan then you can't be an animal lover (he said it differently but that's basically what he meant) and I found that quite extreme. I don't like hypocrisy just like the next person but with that logic from that guy, he also shouldn't drive or do anything else that could effect the planet because yes even with the 51% of damage being done by farming and eating meat, there's still another 49% that could be prevented. So let's say the person is fully vegan but still drives a car, flies on a plane twice a year and throws plastic away; aren't they also being a hypocrite? That's why I didn't like that strong statement because it was trying to guilt trip the viewers for their purpose.Other than that, I found the rest of it interesting and thought provoking. This might make me sound uneducated but I had no idea that farming contributed to the crisis of the planet and it was nice that I watched this doc with a lack of knowledge of what it was going to be about, I know it's an old doc (2014) but I hadn't heard much about it at all.I'd suggest to anyone who's come here looking for an opinion before watching it, have an open mind and take the doc for what it is. If you passionately hate vegans then you probably won't lild this documentary (lmao) but if you're like me and just want a doc to pass the time and won't take a person insult from it, then I'd say you most likely will enjoy it! I'd say the doc time of 1 hr 30 could have been shortened down to an hour but the majority has good details and interviews.6/10"
" Questionable, but worth seeing
",2018-10-30 00:00:00,6,"This brings up some important points re climate change, how it is occurring, and what can be done about it. Unfortunately the filmmakers' approach is highly questionable. They start with the premise, based on one report by some UN agency, that methane produced by cows is the biggest environmental threat we face. This is not a widely agreed upon fact. Then they try to make it look like leading environmental groups like Greenpeace are dodging them and lying to them. This is also open to question. I think it is worth watching so long as you don't buy into everything they say - or immediately dismiss them as crackpots."
" A Must Watch Even For Skeptics
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,7,"This documentary brings up excellent points about how it's possible that the one thing killing the planet the fastest is the animal agriculture industry. While I don't agree with all the facts, I still think everyone should watch 7/10"
" What a joke!
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,1,Vegan propaganda at its finest. They were so concerned that nobody had heard of the 1 study that this whole movie is based on. No one heard of it cause it was horribly incorrect and skewd by vegantheory.
" Lies upon lies
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,1,This mockumentary is based on false and exaggerated numbers. In no way is livestock the number 1 reason to global warming.
" Corruption and abuse in every aspect of our lives
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,10,"Difficult but necessary to watch how the animals born into a factory farm to live a life in unnatural conditions used up discarded with not a moment of human decency their newborns delivered while they stand on concrete with milking rods attached to their teats, they are snatched from the womb crying for their mothers who cannot even turn to contest this horrific cruelty.The male babies placed in restrictive crates to not move for 3 months then slaughtered as veal or female babies religated to the same fate as their mothers. TO WHAT END???
The question is answered...and some of it may surprise you. This is a must see for the blissfully unaware. Put them in a headlock and make em watch. 
We're killing the planet with methane gas, polluting the water supply with excrement and killing ourselves with the inflammation from dairy.
Perhaps these creatures are exacting their revenge
We need to hold ourselves our government and those who are manipulating the truth in order to make profits off this atrocity to the fire."
" Utter nonsense
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,3,"This ""documentary"" is not a documentary. It's a rabid attempt to make everyone who isn't a vegan feel like they should be. The science mentioned in this film is purposedly misinterpreted or straight up false. Just Google something like ""Cowspiracy accuracy"". It's ludicrous.And I'm all for being vegan, saving the planet and what not, but Cowspiracy does that take a reasonable approach to this subject at all. It's scare tactics and nothing else. But hey - if you became vegan after watching it then it served its purpose. The reason you became vegan may be nonsense, but you became vegan nonetheless. Just remember that."
" Statements need to be supported with evidence
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,1,"People credit this movie as the reason they turned vegan. 
Not a lot of evidence and hardfacts here. Just someone pushing their propaganda without backing it up with science.They don't really show any credible evidence to support their claims and chuck out numbers that are pretty meaningless without the correct context and explanation. Just because it's on Netglux doesn't mean it's any good"
" Another BS lie to convert everyone into Veganism
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,1,"This is the 4th documentary I have seen designed to manipulate people like myself into veganism. I have to say the more of these documentaries I see, the less credible veganism becomes. I agree that global warming exist and its bad but they do nothing but fear monger and attempt to manipulate viewers with lies. They did a damn good job attempting to tie global warming with slaughtering animals for human consumption. Seriously if we want to end global warming, the best way to do it is population reduction and the complete elimination of the use oil, gas and coal."

",2018-02-09 00:00:00,5,"This movie is really depressing, but also realistic. It shows us what is happening with the worlds climate, and it shows that we need to do something now, if we wants the world to change. 
I think its great that this documentary, shows us what is happening to the world, but i also think that the movie is long-drawn-out, and maybe they could have made it more interesting."
" Cow
",2018-02-09 00:00:00,9,I think that's a good movie. Because it puts global warming in a different perspective and it is not only oil and coal that is a problem.

Kip then go out to find some answers. He talks to a lot of people and some environment people and they wont give him the answers. So he go to some people there ""risks"" there life to talk about the problem.

" A Little Disappointing
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,6,"I had an experience kind of similar to the filmmaker's: I had been told that at home, I have to be more environmentally minded - turn up the thermostat in the summer, down in the winter, take shorter showers, turn lights off whenever I can, etc. I discovered recently that animal agriculture was significantly destructive on the environment, and I wanted to find out more, so I watched this documentary. To be honest, I was a little disappointed in it.Maybe it wasn't meant specifically for me. Maybe it was meant for people who had never considered that animal agriculture was environmentally destructive. But, for someone who already agreed with the notion, it felt like much of the film was devoted to establishing the facts and knocking down people (such as organic farmers, no-meat Mondays) who were 'patting themselves on the back'. Only in the very last portion did the filmmaker indicate what can be done to fix the problem (i.e. vegan-ism). What I was hoping for was a more in-depth look at evaluation of each meat. Okay, obviously beef is the most destructive. If we cut beef would we be okay? How do pork and lamb and poultry compare? If natural fisheries are unsustainable, how about changing the water resources we use on livestock farming and do fish farming instead? Of course it would be ideal for the whole world to turn vegan overnight, but the simple fact is that solutions demand compromise.As it is, I appreciated the film. I thought it was well-made, and captured a very kairotic topic that not enough people are talking about. I think the filmmaker failed to establish proof of a 'cowspiracy,' considering the notion of livestock farming be environmentally dangerous is simply not obvious, so it hasn't been as explored. He failed to establish that this is something that is being hush-hushed or covered up. I think it's just not being talked about enough because it's not as obvious.I would recommend this film to most anyone, because it could give you valuable insight to an important topic that isn't discussed enough. However, I can't promise you that it's compelling enough to definitely change your life. Some people will watch this and maybe think twice before buying meat at the grocery store, but still buy it anyway."
" Brings Up Important Issues But Uses Exaggerated Data, Sketchy Sources and Creative Editing of Interviews
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,3,"This could have been a very good documentary discussing the sustainability issues in modern food production (both in livestock and crops/vegetables growing) but instead it turned into promoting vegan lifestyle using questionable statistics and creative editing of interviews.The director keeps talking about ""51% of global emissions caused by animal agriculture"", yet that number comes from a sketchy non peer-reviewed source. Far more credible UN report based on peer-reviewed research pegs it at about 14%. Because it doesn't fit the narrative, the latter is called ""biased"" and a result of a ""conspiracy"". You see similar use on completely made-up stats from questionable sources and dismissal of publicly available peer-reviewed data throughout the film.Several subjects of the interviews in the film have since come forward alleging the author has creatively edited and misrepresented their words. They've challenged him to release the full length interviews on a number of occasions. During one of the debates, the author vaguely promised to release ""longer length interviews"" (note the selective wording), but to this day... nada. That's got to tell you something.The latter part of the movie is trying to evoke emotions showing killing of an animal and promoting a vegan lifestyle as an ethical and healthy choice. There are a couple of problems here too.One -- hordes of small animals (mostly rodents) are killed off during crop/vegetable growing seasons. In fact, there's peer-reviewed research showing if one is to follow the least harm principle, their diet would not be vegan but include herbivore animal products. Though it is understandable that most people don't think beyond what is in front of their eyes and the director is taking full advantage of it.Second -- one cannot get full nutrition required by human body on a vegan diet. You need to either take supplements (such as B12) or consume large amounts of fermented food each day. While vegan diet is better than your typical average North American diet, it is by no means perfect.The author deserves some credit for bringing the issue of sustainability and animal abuse in modern factory farming, but the more I researched the material, statistics and data he's employed, the more I was disappointed. Shameful, because this is a missed opportunity, in my opinion."
" Life Changing
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,10,"I feel as if I've become enlightened and can now see behind the propaganda of the meat and dairy industries. This documentary has changed my life. My husband and I became vegan that night. Excellent job of revealing the facts. I don't know how anyone could continue to eat meat, fish and dairy after seeing the facts. Everyone should watch this film."
" Over-hyped and 'Over-dramatic
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,3,"This documentary is literally like watching an 8 year old child whose done a presentation on 'livestock', barely knows what he's talking about, but is very passionate and throwing obscure 'statistics' in your face, just very desperate to get a gold star. As other reviews have also highlighted, his statistics mostly come from very sketchy sources (for which would not be acceptable in any high- level academic paper),and any interviewees who discuss his argument for the other side simply have their point cut in half. This is not a conspiracy, it's just an irrelevant issue not worth the time and resources of the high-profile environmental groups."
" Finally Someone Speaks Out
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,10,"The US agricultural industry not only causes huge environmental and human health problems, they get virtually a free pass from any meaningful regulatory oversight and rarely get criticized or exposed. This movie does a great job of showing some of the facets of harm and lack of control or attention paid to this problem. Just a tremendously huge breath of fresh air."
" Surprising Documentary
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,3,"I just finished watching the movie and I paid attention to the point it was trying to convey, but all I saw was that the Vegans were pushing their agenda. They preach that meat is the cause for how the world is right now. They talk about water consumption, population growth and therefore more meat is required. So they say do not eat meat, well OK, what if the humans stop eating meat... What then? Plants need water to grow, the more water a plant intakes the bigger it grows. All these people talking about population growth in the movie... well I am sure they have kids of their own. So why talk about population growth if they themselves are contributing to the growth. Pollution from engines will take over and now what... should we stop driving? I am sure they won't say that then. If crops were to be grown at a large scale in order to feed all the humans on this planet they could not use that same amount of land. They are right about needing lesser land to grow crops, but when the meat is taken away to go Vegan, just the demand alone for the vegetables would probably take up just as much if not more land than cattle take up. It is just a Vegan Agenda with good information, but yet they seem to realize that crops right now are not the main source of food. If crops were the main food source, now you would be including all the electricity, chemicals, land, and water that will be needed in order to produce the billions of pounds of vegetation needed for the human population, because we cannot survive off of only one vegetable, we would require several of them, and they all cannot be grown in the same plot of land or at the same time. Each Vegetable requires different amounts of just the few items I stated."
" Cowspiracy: amazing movie
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,10,"This documentary was really eye-opening for me. This movie helped me to become vegan and I really recommend everyone to watch this movie. As a previous reviewer wrote, this movie will never be played at schools and on the television, which is a shame, because if everyone knew all the facts that are explained in this movie, that could really make a difference on our planet."
" I only managed to watch 20 minutes of this movie
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,1,"I work as a researcher in the energy sector. CO2 emissions are literally a part of my job. Everybody agrees we are emitting too much emissions. The movie tells lie after lie about greenhouse gas emissions. Yes its true that methane is about 25 times more powerful as a greenhouse gas, but even taking that into account the Enteric Fermentation (Farts and burps) of cattle accounts for 3 percent of the total. While the energy sector emits 29% and the transport 27%. That is why no one is talking about it! because we have to first focus on bringing down the emissions of the sectors that emit a lot more CO2 equivalent gases. The part about destroying the forests and the environment for our animals could be true. But the part of the water is another time way over exaggerated. Yes a burger needs a lot of water to be produced, but most of that water falls right out of the sky as rain.After 20 minutes I just couldn't take the lies anymore they invent numbers like cattle accounts for 50% of all emissions...I believe in improving the environment and that we have to change a lot to combat with climate change. But what they are proposing is the same as his example of the shower. Not eating meat isn't going to help at all compared to improving the emissions of transport and improving the emissions of the energy sector, the sector that emits the most CO2. So lets invest in Carbon capture and storage for coal and CCGT plants, install more renewable generation, all buy electric cars, and that's the way to solve the problem. Not becoming vegetarian.I was so furious about the numbers they were claiming that I really had to write a review. (first review ever on IMDb by the way)"
