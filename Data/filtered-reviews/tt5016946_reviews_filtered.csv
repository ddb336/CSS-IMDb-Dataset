" Beautiful message.
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,5,In the end you will understand... This movie means a lot even if he's not well done.
" One thing just doesn't sit right
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed the movie. I love it when minorities get represented because then deserve it as much as anyone else. Its a classic ""never going to happen in real life"" story but its a movie what can you expect. One thing though, I can not get it out of my head. Ned literally OUTED Connor. Like miss girl thats one of the meanest and disgusting things you can do. It can not be tolerated, no matter the circumstances. It was just brushed away to the side like it was nothing? Like thats just not okay lol. That is the biggest criticism I have. It is probably because the writer was probably straight and did not know how disgusting outing someone is. Anyways, for the rest I enjoyed the movie. A bit simple but nice :)"
" A bit misleading and shorthand for teenage misfit struggles
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,4,"I get the point: as a teenage you feel the pressure to conform to the norms of the ones surrounding you, specially in an extreme situation of a boys boarding school in Ireland. However, this film shorthanded misfit for being gay in a contrived way, almost with a purpose of fitting a narrative. Like, suddenly, the creep ginger boy, the rugby star and the charismatic English teacher are all different... and gay? And like, if you feel weird you should come out because ""if you don't live your life no one will live it for you""? As if you can't be different and still being hetero. I went to a boys school myself and I appreciated some parts of this movie as it brought me back some good memories, however I don't think it tells an accurate story about what is like to be different, actually as in any other school, teenagers end up grouping together on their clusters, the football guys, the gamers, the smokers, the bullies, the nerds, the loners...
The movie is enjoyable to watch though, I gave 4 stars for good directing and decent acting."
" One of My Favorite Movies
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,10,I love this movie so much and I always come back to it when I'm feeling down. It has an excellent soundtrack and portrays a great story.
" Not sure if depicting bullying or celebrating it
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,1,"For anyone trying to watch something remotely respectful - find a different movie. Is it okay to be a bully and homophobic? According to this movie this only results in a happy ending. You don't live for sports? Obviously, you're wrong, not cool, since you should."
" Why evey movie nowadays have to be about that
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,3,I know for fact people gonna tell me that I hate gays it is not about that it is just about everything is now about it now a days please stop destroying movies with potential and I am even mad about the movie description it was like description f9r a different movie
" Go and watch it. Please.
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,8,"I have watched quite a few films in the last few days because I have a cold and am in bed, and this is one that has stuck with me for a few days. It's not exactly a nuanced message, but I enjoyed the acting, the characters, the relationships and the writing. Not to mention the direction. I enjoyed it all, that is to say."
" A Fresh Take On A Coming Of Age Teen
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,9,"You can't help but fall in love with the lead--Ned, as he goes through the common feelings of growing up knowing you are gay and not feeling accepted. Whether you love him like a son, a friend, or something more, you do LOVE this kid in some kind of way.This movie is better than most others like it.The soundtrack is excellent and heightens every scene--truly a masterpiece. The acting and directing are all very fine as is the script.
My only disappointment is that there is no great love scene in this film. After wetting our appetite so skillfully and perfectly, there is no pay off. If there is a sequel that picks up where this leaves off, I will be first in line.That said, it left me in tears and was a beautiful film. The ending just incomplete."
" Amazing Film
",2020-09-16 00:00:00,8,"Well made film with incredible acting, casting, cinematography, set design, and storytelling. Anyone who has struggled with family, friendship, or being ostracized at school can relate to our characters. The ending is somewhat cliched and predictable, but not in a cringey way."
" Meh!
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,3,"Many good reviews. Don't get it. Is a bad movie. Simple story. Slow. Meh! I like gay themed movies, but there are sooooo many better movies than this one."
" Everyone can relate to this movie
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,8,"This is a realistic movie about teens knowing about who they are: Their sexuality, about their parents and who they want to be in this world."
" Garbage
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,1,"Formula trash, the two central characters never became any sort of friends and the 'plot' went nowhere apart from the predictable rugby team win. Rubbish"
" must watch
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,10,"Just an incredible story line and great acting! It is worth to watch, teenage love story."
" one of my faves
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"This movie is one of my favorite movie, because, first of all, i love andrew scott in this film, his character is such a sweet yet strong person. this story may not be all that complicated, or is may not be the great gay movie you wanted, but it sends a certain message. a message to accept yourself, and others, for who they are. which can seem very cliche and it definitely is. this is a story about being different and still have so much in common. i also love how is this movie, a movie about being gay, they not even say the word 'gay' or 'homosexual' or something like that. very cool."
" warm and fuzzy
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,10,"OMG ... a movie that had 2 attractive people as leads and it managed to be about friendship and about being a human being, instead of being about getting a boyfriend ... I am amazed!!
The movie in itself is not some great masterpiece, but it is heartfelt and it gives you warm, fuzzy feelings and the leads are attractive ( what do you want, I never said i am not shallow ). And I am truly in awe when a movie manages to be about friendship for real and not use friendship just to somehow end up being about romance."
" Hope from hopelessness...
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,6,"Quite an illustrative tale of conforming, this film. It is gay themed, but could equally apply to anyone new to an environment and who struggles to fit in. Here, two classmates who share a room form an unlikely bond; one a star sportsman and the other a bit of a pariah. It has two redeeming features of note - the use of sport as a positive conduit, albeit via a pretty circuitous route; and by allowing initially hostile characters to reprioritise their beliefs and accept a relationship that would otherwise attract their derision (as, indeed, it does initially). Fionn O'Shea and Nicholas Galitzine - with a bit of help from their teacher Andrew Scott - contribute well, with a strong, plausible, script to make for a decent drama."
" A Film for the Outcasted.
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,9,"I'm not going to write much, as I believe everyone should make their own opinions off of what they've watched themselves, but I can say this film was very enjoyable for me to watch as It was something that I could relate to and I'm sure many others can.I didn't give it a 10 because I wanted it to be longer - (just a personal wish, since I really liked it) and also because It didn't have the biggest Impact on me but that's not a bad thing and it doesn't have to, it still affected me in a good way - this film was enough, and well written/acted - the story premis was interesting and I can go on forever but - I just really enjoyed it and yes I would recommend it."
" Could of been much better
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,5,"Missing sexual tension, maybe a kiss? Something more?"
" A Well Done, Poignant Film
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,8,"I was expecting this movie to be a combination of Good Will Hunting and Brokeback Mountain. However, I was pleasantly surprised.Fionn O'Shea plays Ned, an outsider forced to attend a rugby-obsessed boarding school. Nicholas Galitzine is Conor, a rugby star is also forced to attend the same boarding school when he is kicked out the previous one for fighting. Ned acts as narrator of the events in the film, having written an essay for the school contest about the worst moment in his life. The two are first roommates, then band mates, then friends. However, the shadow of homosexuality hangs over the proceedings more as a ghost than an actual plot device. There are no ""gay scenes"" just some really funny and witty dialogue between young people trying to discover themselves. This could have been a movie about alcoholism or addiction to video games and it would have had the same impact. Homosexuality was handled by the production as something normal, albeit difficult to rectify with current cultural mores. Kids have so many things to deal with in puberty, its a wonder they make it out of their teens alive.Andrew Scott and Michael McElhatton are the adults overseeing the events. Scott plays Mr. Sherry, the English Lit teacher who takes on a mentoring role ala Robin Williams in Hunting. He is both hilarious in his teaching methods and caring in his concern for the boys. McElhatton is the chancellor of the school and he does a great job of portraying what could have been a ""Dean Wormer"" parody into a three dimensional character who provides strict, but fair oversight. Lastly, Moe Dunford as the obsessed rugby coach is both funny, scary and pathetic. He's the one character, by the end of the film, I could not decide whether I liked or hated.The film does suffer from the obligatory one-dimensional bully whose sole purpose in the film is to drive a wedge between the two friends. Overall, however, the movie is well-written, well-acted and well-directed. The pacing was really good, too, and I never got bored or felt it bogged down."
" Handsome Devil Review
",2019-07-11 00:00:00,8,"It's not original, but at least not bad either. Andrew Scott as always saves the film. I think the film could have given a little more time to develop the friendship between Ned and Conor. I liked that at no point did Ned become confused about his feelings for Conor, he always saw him only as a friend."
" Amazing & touching movie
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,10,"If you're young & gay or of any age & in the closet or you're out you Will completely relate to this amazingly beautiful movie. It's so hard to be gay especially when we're young & in school. The story is so well done & the 2 main actors do an incredible job. I gave this a 10 out of 10 stars & if I could give it more stars I would. This is 1 of my all time favorite LGBT movies along with the movie ""Love Simon"". Handsome Devil is a must see movie."
" It's all about belief
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,9,"It is not the type that you are that defines you, it is what you are as a complete composition that matters the most.
If we stop seeing the difference and start seeing the obvious similarities each and every day would end positively"
" Perfect Movie!!!!
",2018-12-15 00:00:00,10,"I didn't expect that, but you have to watch this movie, made me so happy!!!!!!"
" So many emotions.
",2018-12-11 00:00:00,7,"I felt when I watch this movie, the real emotions when I coming out to my friends and the people who's aroud me. The expression in the movie ""Not to speak in a borrowed voice"" is so special, be yourself, don't act like someone else..."
" 8
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,8,"Very good film about everything literally. It's showing bullies, boarding school hazing rules, people's choice who they want to be. A little bit propaganda like at the ending where almost all team supported those 2(gay couple). The ending was pretty good still missed at least 1 kiss between them."
" Any film named after a Smiths song has to be great right?
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,9,"Handsome Devil. A little Indie about a gay student rugby player at a public school in Ireland trying to hide who he is against the backdrop of institutional homophobia. An absolute gem of a film. Genuinely funny, moving and loveable. Not all great films are bleak..... Up there with Sing Street for feel good value. Currently on Netflix. A surprisingly brilliant 9 out of ten"
" I caught this on Netflix!
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,10,"And what a find! Wow, terrific writing, nothing felt forced or cliched or absurd or disjointed or lamo, no this was pure original creative art just flowing and doing its thing, it felt nice. I don't know what else to say, but that I don't know nor care the first dang thing about rugby, but I found myself rooting for the gay team with the happy players lol, this was terrific! I would love to see more from this gentleman in Irish town? Wherever that is, who cares, does it matter, as long as Netflix or someone picks the gems up and delivers the goods to people that enjoy fun new creative things...."
" Review
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,10,"This movie, i like it.
ANOTHER!A sequel would be nice, i'd love to see how Conner and Ned's relationship will evolve.Also Andrew Scott is great at playing a teacher, i love his work!"
" Heinously plagiaristic.
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,4,"This is a messy, confused little film, which is unlikely to appeal to any of the demographics it targets.Butch rugby fans will find much better sports movies elsewhere. Angst-ridden gay teens have a whole sub-genre of films just for them. Outcast straight teens in crappy schools have almost an entire movie industry devoted to them. Kids who want to be singers have a small but superior selection to choose from.Handsome Devil is essentially a scattering of random tropes thrown without much thought or conviction in the general direction of the audience in the hope that one or two ideas might find a willing target.One of several unfortunate ironies to be found in this film is that one of its central themes is that we should all avoid plagiarism and find our own voice. Ironic since almost every important scene in the film is ""borrowed"" shamelessly from the far superior Dead Poet's Society:The English teacher who inspires his students by respecting, entertaining, and yes, even yawping at them. (Although here, instead of sounding a mighty yawp, the boys are taught to ""project"" their voices).The English teacher encouraging a student to perform on stage - in DPS it's an amateur play, in HD it's a talent contest.And most blatantly, the ""Oh captain, my captain"" scene from DPS, in which the boys stand one by one on their desks, is represented here by the boys moving one by one to the other side of the locker room in solidarity against the nasty teacher; a cookie-cutter homophobe presented in two dimensions by an actor who missed every opportunity to rise above poor direction and writing and use the large amount of screen time he is given to transcend weak material and shine.The scenes that aren't taken from Dead Poet's Society are borrowed from every other school sports movie that's ever been made, apart from the singing scenes which are borrowed from Sing Street.Nothing about this film is any better than those it copies, so you may as well watch all of them instead."
" Thoroughly predictable, thoroughly dull
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,2,"A cross between Dead Poets Soxiety and an 80s Pink Peril film, this witless drama's leaden script and lifeless performances leave no cinematic cliché unexplored."
" A charming coming of age film
",2018-04-27 00:00:00,9,"I loved this film. I went to a rugby school in Ireland in the 1960s but wasn't any good at rugby myself. I'm gay too but back then it was something to keep quiet about., A lot of people have assumed that the character, Ned, is gay. In fact the film never makes clear whether he is or not (this was confirmed by the director). I loved how Fionn O'Shea played the character. He may have been picked on for being different but he wasn't a shrinking violet and verbally gave as good as he got. I also marveled at how Nicholas Galitzine, a young English actor, got the middle class south Dublin accent so right.
The rugby scenes are as authentic as any you will see in a movie.The director used Leinster under 19 players. I met him at a festival and he told me that they assembled them for the filming of the rugby scenes but hadn't told them who the choreographer was going to be. They were both gobsmacked and delighted when it turned out to be Brian O'Driscoll (for those unfamiliar with rugby he is widely regarded as Ireland's greatest ever rugby player - his wife played Ned's mother in the film).
As others have noted the upbeat ending was really necessary in this film."
" Music, sport and then there's gay.
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,7,"I have seen many gay films, but I never felt very satisfied as this one. It removed all the cliches. You don't get a product like that often. I mean, despite being a gay film, there's no romance in it. But everything was told from a different aspect, like whether it is in the eye of sport, music, et cetera. Maybe if one film that families should watch regarding gay theme, that could be this one. Of course the families should be open minded on LGBT for that. Because the film does not promote gayism, but in a normal tone to say, it's about harassment being whatever you are. And at the end gives a fine message.Welcome to T18. I mean happy new year. This is my first review of the year. It is a good start for me being a cinephile. As I've said, it is a rare gem. An Irish film, but in English language. Remember, it is not even a British or Aussie, so the cast and crew are completely unknown. That means it is like watching some B movie. The initial setup reminded me 'Wild Child'. But that was an American film, from Americans perspective, how they see British boarding school. So if you are regular Hollywood teen film watcher, then you might feel slightly strange watching this. Because the students are obedient against their teacher, unlike American rebellious kids.-xX] There will come a point in the future when you won't have to lie anymore. [Xx-The film title might hint strongly that it is a gay romance, but as I said it was not. This is the story of two boys, but most of it was narrated from Ned's perspective. When his parents moved to Southwestern Asia for work, he was left behind at a boarding school. Among bullies, he's very popular for his sexual orientation. But it was never been confirmed, until a new roommate joins him. He's handsome and a rugby player, but they both put together for a talent show, where they have to prepare a song to sing. So the conflict of interest between sport and music surface and fuels further complication in what it is already out of control.This film was made last year, before that year was when the same-sex marriage legalised in Ireland. But the timeline of the film is unknown. Mostly like it just before the legalisation. Because seeing how the story happened, it all makes sense. Still a mixed response from the people, the gays are hesitating to come out of the closet. So the harassers still targeting such people, that's what this film is about. In addition to that, the story was told from the teenager's perspective, but I loved that small part of aspect from a teacher. That kind of looked like a bonus advantage of the film.Regarding Rugby, it was part of the storytelling, not the whole story. So whatever happen in the sporting event was a normal result than considered as a cliche. The same goes for the music part of the film too. It did delivered the message cleverly. The best of it was how these two themes were merged to get a wonderful awareness film. Not just one of the best gay film, but one of the best films of the year. Totally worth a watch!7/10"
" Not quite a win
",2017-12-19 00:00:00,8,"Despite the merits of good acting and interesting characters, the film fell short. The team may have won the game and homosexual friends may have scored progress on the larger field of social acceptance but the blatant inability to include the word ""gay"" in the proud courageous locker-room profession of Conor as well as the complete absence of same sex physical intimacy in the film smacks of fearful conservatism and apologetic. Perhaps this story is relatively radical for Ireland in 2016 but for the larger Western audience it is not quite a win. Sorry."
" Inspired and disappointed at the same time !
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,7,"I really liked it. Reminded me the book ""The third pillow"" (Original title: O Terceiro Travesseiro) but I was misled that Ned and Connor had more than a simple friendship. I was expecting some romance between them not only a true friend supporting someone to come out. Much more could be explored. It was not a complete waste of time because Ned's and Conor's personality is captivating."
" Dead Poets Society does Rugby
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,7,"The age-old story of an unlikely friendship between the athlete and the outsider with a large dose of Dead Poets Society thrown in.Its not original but the film is heart-warming and full of charm. Well acted throughout with many well known names in cameo roles. The most well known is Andrew Scott who plays the unconventional English teacher who tries to encourage the outsider while helping the developing friendship with the schools star rugby player. The film is emotionally manipulative at times, pulling familiar tricks to get the viewers sympathy but its easy to forgive when the characters and dialogue are so charming. The use of voice-over and split screen are not always effective and detract from the film at times. And the lead characters could have been developed more. But overall Handsome Devil is a charm and an easy pleasure to watch."
" Great Irish Indie On Rugby, Boarding School and being 'different'
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,7,"Ned hates school his father has remarried and decided to send his only son off to a boarding school. It is one of those schools where sports rule and in particular – rugby. Yes the ultra macho contact sport where beef, brawn and attitude count. My school was very similar. Ned is not sport minded and as such is an outcast being sneered at for being 'gay'.Then new boy Connor arrives under a cloud from his previous school. Only he is also a top rugger player and gets placed in the same room as Ned. The Jock and the 'gay' are not best suited and neither boy is happy. However, the two soon form a bond based on mutual interests but it soon becomes apparent that the natural order of things is only allowed to be in flux for so long before the forces, that be, must exert themselves and return everything to its proper place.Now this is a film supported by The Irish Film Board and has a cast peppered with talent including Ardal O'Hanlon, Moe Dunford ('Vikings') and Amy Huberman ('Moone Boy') and everyone puts in good performances. It can be light hearted and lack in character development in places, but it is a well rounded drama which focuses on those that we chose to exclude and how that fear of revulsion changes a person – and not always for the better. It is a scenario that is familiar to many and not one that any of us ought to be proud of for taking part in. It is also a ruddy good watch with perfect timing and drama to keep you hooked till the credits roll – easily recommended."
" A movie we all can relate to
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,10,"I picked this off Netflix on a boring Saturday afternoon. Boy I wish I had seen it sooner.I was totally shocked at how good it is - the story line is something we can all relate to - a world that often isolates those who don't ""fit in"".Fionn (Ned) and Nicholas (Connor) are absolutely relatable in their roles, and I loved the cameo by the English Teacher. While some may critique the ending as ""predictable"", but IMO any other type ending would destroy this movie. After the emotional roller-coaster of the film, we NEEDED that ending. Thoroughly recommend it for all - especially for those who think that anyone who is different is a lesser individual."
" Excellent Movie
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,9,"This was a film that I could absolutely relate to. Like Ned I had to hide my true feelings.It was a very lovely film, but essentially just a film.It does not have the intensity of ""Monster Pies"" or the heartbreak that ""Center of my World"" evokes. Maybe ""Fair Haven"" would adequately describe the emotion that this film arouses in me. Having said that, I would watch it again, if only for the pleasure of seeing ""Conor"" running around the Rugby pitch. Watch and enjoy.It was a pleasure that will last."
" Brilliant Film
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,8,"Really really amazing film. Any outcast or anyone who's just a bit different really, can relate to this film. I relate to Ned a lot, school isn't very fun, I'm different from everyone else, a**holes tend to take an interest in me, never quite fit in, and I actually did what he did with the song lyrics once. I also relate to Connor in the fact that I'm gay and closeted and I understand that fear, I have had some bad experiences, gotten into some fights so I understand that bit about him. Because I relate to the characters, all the experiences these guys went through felt very real to me and I loved the way they were portrayed. The acting and dialogue were great and the way this was written and shot was amazing.So yea definitely give this a watch, its a brilliant film."
" Dead Poets Society remake with a slightly different spin
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,9,"I loved the movie. The only reason it's not a 10/10 is that it's way too similar to the Dead Poets Society. Same English teacher with his unorthodox pedagogy, same sports vs. arts dilemmas, except this time the characters are openly gay and that adds a dimension. It's equally moving, with the same twist of pupils taking sides, which is the climax of the movie. The acting is great too. I wouldn't be surprised if 5-10 years down the road we see some of these same faces playing in the top gear movies, running for the top prizes. Certainly worth watching - it's not just a coming out of age and a coming out of closet movie, but also a touching young folks' drama set up in a realistic environment. Great piece!"
" Handsome Devil is feel good coming out
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,9,"Handsome devil is a feel-good story about two teenagers learning to come out in a boarding school full of rugby crazed adults and students. This one as well acted, is dramatic, has interesting characters, and isn't too after school special to be fun to watch. Sherlocks own Moriarty takes a turn as the Dead Poets Society level English teacher that inspires them all to be better people. I didn't like how the school allowed massive bullying and physical aggression from teachers and students. The subplot was intriguing, came to a good conclusion, but still left me interested to hear more about it. The ending is a little hokey but we could all use a little cheer now and then. This one is just a fun story that leaves us wanting more, and by Moore I mean I wanted more romance, but I'll settle for the ending I got."
" Could be about anyone that doesn't fit in, and it would still have the same message.
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,9,"'HANDSOME DEVIL': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) An Irish coming-of-age drama film, about an outcast and an athlete that are forced to share the same bedroom at their boarding school. They of course bond in the process. The movie was written and directed by John Butler. It stars Fionn O'Shea, Nicholas Galitzine, Andrew Scott, Moe Dunford and Michael McElhatton. Being an outcast myself, all of my life, I enjoyed the film quite a bit.Ned (O'Shea) is a gay outcast that's forced to attend a new boarding school. Conor (Galitzine) was a star rugby athlete, at his old school (who got into too many fights there), and he's now forced to attend the same school. The two are also forced to share the same bedroom together, and they both immediately hate the idea. Over time they bond though, and they even form a two member band together. This doesn't go over well with some of the authorities though, at the rugby obsessed school, and their new friendship is tested.This is a movie I hadn't heard anything about before seeing it. Then my friend asked me if I wanted to review it, for his website Film-Arcade.net. So after reading about it on IMDb, I said yeah. He sent me the screener, and I was very pleasantly surprised by it. It's a really touching coming-of-age tale, about being an outcast and not fitting in. This film is more specifically about being gay, but it could be about anyone that doesn't fit in (to the social norm) and it would still have the same message. I've been bullied my whole life, for being different (and more specifically for looking different). So many people have socially rejected me for this that it's really caused some serious emotional (and mental) issues. So this movie really spoke to me. I loved it!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/WXRjz4hXVvs"
" New Twists to Boarding School Tale
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,7,"When you spend your life trying to be someone you are not, who is going to be you?! Ned, a fiercely independent teen at a rugby obsessed boarding school, struggles with the answer to this question. Isolated and bullied just because he is different, Ned figures that keeping his head down is the best option to endure the school year. Yet how quickly things can change. A dynamic teacher and omnipotent rugby star, each grappling with their own demons, transfer to the school. Meeting them is the worst and the best thing to happen to Ned. He discovers that what is more important than being cool, is what is beautiful. Yet beauty has its price.In Handsome Devil, new twists are added to the familiar tale of a teen attempting to stand up in the face of bullying, and reconcile athletics with learning. The added perspectives include a faculty member and a star athlete who face harassment and threats as harsh as those faced by the main character. While the film is predictable in places and the scenes and acting not as exquisite as they might be, I enjoyed the rich dialogue and the new angles on the characters. I really liked the director's previous film, the Stag, for its humor and unique approach to a familiar theme (in this case, a wedding and bachelor's party). Seen at the Miami International Film Festival."
