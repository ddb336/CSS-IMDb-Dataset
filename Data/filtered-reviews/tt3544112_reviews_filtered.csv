" I'm literally crying
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,10,"As a kid I was obsessed with this film, it was the film that introduced me to beautiful cinima. I had forgotten the name of it up until now and something just clicked so I turned it on and this is probably the second run though of it today"
" Charming Yet Conventional
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,6,"Sing Street is written and directed by John Carney and tells the story of Conor, a 15-year-old schoolboy whose home life is in turmoil after his parent's relationship becomes strain due to their finial situation, among other issues. While at his new school Conor takes a liking to a mysterious girl who he wants to impress by starting a band. Released across the year of 2016, Sing Street was meant with wonderful reception from both audiences and critics.
Sing Street was a movie I was looking forward to due to its concept, I went in knowing very little about the story and John Carney's other works and was left genuinely pleased with the end product. Sing Street is a very charming film that has an obvious amount of loved poured into the film, it's clear that this story meant a lot to Carney and he did a wonderful job bringing it to life. While shot pretty conventionally, the use of colour and the film's aesthetic were pleasing and the themes of love and love lost were nice additions. I would also be remiss to mention the music in this film is great, both original and copyrighted songs. The love for post-punk from the '70s and '80s is evident here and while being a fan of the genre I felt that the songs made for this movie were extremely catchy and see myself listening to them in my free time.
The actors and actresses also do a great job, there was no bad performance, everyone felt real, particularly that of Ferdia Walsh-Peelo and Jack Reynor who play brothers in this movie. I thought their performances were excellent, conveying many emotions throughout and I really bought their relationship as siblings. Lucy Boynton who plays the love interest, Raphina, was also great, I thought she was very compelling in her role.
There is a lot to like about this film, however, it's not without its faults. While charming, I felt that the story's framework largely felt trapped in a cliché, I understand it's a feel-good movie and while that's all well and good, it offers nothing new that I haven't seen before. It becomes pretty clear how the story will play out fifteen minutes into the film and though I was entertained by the ride I wish the film would have taken more risks. I also wish we would've seen more of the band and interaction amongst the members, I felt they all took a backseat once the relationship between Conor and Raphina took off. I also felt the direction they took the bully character in the film didn't really work for me, I didn't feel the story earned that sort of payoff with his character nor was it really warranted, it's something you will think is nice while watching the movie in the moment however doesn't make much sense if you really think about it. Another character I felt that the writers didn't really wrap up properly, was Brendan. Similar to the band I did long to see a couple more scenes between him and Conor, just to build their connection for the audience even more. However what they did include is good enough, it's more so where the film leaves off his character. In a film that isn't that challenging and tries to make sure most of the main characters have a well-rounded arc, I didn't feel the filmmakers fully achieved that with Brendan. They hint at his character turning his life around near the beginning of the third act however the audience never sees the full extent of that, nor does it seem like's changed in any way by the time the film comes to close; it's just something that is mentioned in one scene and never brought up again.Lastly, I felt that the story wrapped up a little too clean, as I mentioned moments ago, the writers tried to make sure most, if not all, of the characters has some sort of arc and with the story being pretty by-the-numbers, the ending is a little too perfect. I understand that director, John Carney has mentioned that the ending is left up to the interpretation of the audience, however, if you take the conclusion of the movie at face value it is very storybook ending-like. Some other minor nitpick issues I had with this film, had to be the sound mixing, I found that a lot of the music (while good) should have been mixed differently. For example, there are a couple of instances where characters are watching music videos on T.V. but rather than the songs being mixed so it sounds like it's playing out of a speaker in the movie, it was just overlaid over the dialogue. Similarly, when the band played live, they never felt live in the sense that no other sound effects were done outside of just putting the studio recording of the song over the footage. Speaking of sound effects, there was a really noticeable scene of two characters eating and it was clear that the eating sounds were not mixed properly, it sounded very loud and was out of synch. These were just things small distractions that I noticed, however didn't take too much away from my overall enjoyment.
In conclusion, Sing Street comes down to a give and take. Everything that I really liked about the film, there was something else that I didn't like, it's the epitome of two steps forward, one step back. I think this film really could have been something truly great if it had been in the hands of a more talented director, however, what Carney managed to do should not be diminished either. As I stated from the top, it's clear he put a lot of heart into this film, however much of the film is weighed down by being too conventional. The film didn't have any interesting shots, despite good costuming and colours, the story is charming and had themes to work with, yet wasn't challenging and was the product of its own clichés. I'm not saying I wanted Sing Street to be overly complex or anything, I just really wanted to like it more than I did and I probably would have if the filmmakers had taken more risks. It's a very safe, feel-good movie, that I'm sure anyone would enjoy and while I did, I just wish it had more to offer and for that reason, I am giving Sing Street a 6.5/10"
" Beautiful film & beautiful songs
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,10,Lovely film. I loved the lyrics of the songs and the acting. Sing Street is one of my favourite films. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo is amazing.
" Unexpected and great!
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,8,"Randomly watched this knowing nothing about it and loved it. It's very funny and original, with good music to boot. Definitely worth a go!"
" Wrong film, Great surprise
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,7,"I thought it was another film by elle fanning, so i was very confused in the beginning, then i thought i was gonna watch it for just a while since the accents were killing me..... then something amazing happened, once I started it, I just couldn't stop and found it incrediblely fun to watch, so relexing so sweet all the way, I laughed so many times by those sudden little jokes, they just popped up from nowhere, so natural and so much fun. It's such a good film that comforted you and somehow took you to an emotional journey at the same time. Shouldnt miss it!!!"
" More of a 7.5 stars but I rounded up
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,8,This movie was magic until the grand conclusion. Totally not needed and not wanted. It took away from the feeling of the film. Then it sort of became a forgettable mess afterwards. What a shame. Still a good watch.
" A very good movie
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,8,"I thought Once was an incredible movie but this little film was also excellent.Much better than I thought it would be, it entertained and worked very well.Highly recommended. You won't be disappointed."
" Larger than life!
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,10,"This movie is hauntingly beautiful and charming. It's simple, yet so special. Sing street is about life, family, and love. Sing Street is about chasing your dreams, it's about inspiration.Go chase your dreams, you're never gonna go if you don't go now!A special, special movie. It's a shame it didn't get any Oscar!"
" Pursuit of a DREAM
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,7,"About time for a simple Irish musical romantic movie to change my mood. Good mixing, good acting and good entertainment."
" Wow! Unexpected
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,9,"I thought it was going to be entertaining but by any means I though it could have been such a good movie in every sense! Characters (all of them), photography, acting (all of them) and the music! Wow I'm very happy"
" By far the most underrated film I've ever seen
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,10,The soundtrack is amazing. Especially the original songs. You will be listening to these songs for weeks after you watch this movie.
" Great!
",2020-09-21 00:00:00,8,"Before becoming a writer and director, John Carney played for the Irish band The Frames. In fact, the lead singer of that band, Glen Hansard, starred in Carney's best-known film, 2007's Once alongside his partner in the band Swell Season, Markéta Irglová. Made on a budget of around $150,000, it ended up earning $23.3 million worldwide. an Oscar for the song ""Falling Slowly"" and the admiration of Steven Spielberg, who said, ""Once gave me enough inspiration to last the rest of the year.""Carney replied, ""In the end of the day, he's just a man with a beard.""Sing Street tells the story of Conor ""Cosmo"" Lawlor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo), whose family is struggling so much that he's forced to go shoeless at school when they can't afford the proper ones for his uniform. He's bullied day in and day out, but soon meets Darren, who becomes his manager, and Eamon (Mark McKenna), who can play any instrument. Initially, the idea of a band is just a way to win over Ralphina (Lucy Boynton, who will soon play Marianna Faithfull in Faithfull), who wants to be a model.Soon, though, the band becomes a driving force in their lives and even allows for their bully to have a place to belong. It also allows him to bond with his brother Brendan, who teaches him what music should mean in your life.The close of this film has always made me wonder if everything - please, don't let me spoil it for you, so stop reading if you haven't seen it - from the gym sequence to Cosmo and Ralphina sailing away is all just a dream sequence from a music video.Carney has said, ""Well, I don't see it just as a happy romantic ending. I think that's the tone of the piece, but I think it's more like... they're setting off together, that's true, but I wouldn't say that's some huge relationship that's going to last forever. They're kids. I sort of hope the scene at the end would look a little like a fantasy sequence. You're supposed to wonder where the reality ends and the pop video begins. But people are actually taking it very seriously, and people are presuming it's fully real, which is interesting. That wasn't the intention.""If you grew up in the 80's and dreamed that a girl would fall for you because you were on the verge of becoming a music video star, then this movie will warm your heart. Like all the best films, I wish that it was real."
" Fantastic Irish teen movie - a real delightful surprise
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,8,"Sing Street is one of the most delightful teenage movies made in many years. It is uplifting, quirky and authentic with a cast of mid-teen Dublin kids, many who were first time movie actors, who bring adolescent awkwardness and realism to the roles.Set in Dublin in 1985, the movie revolves around 15 year old Conor Lawlor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) from a professional middle class family fallen on hard times who, in a cost saving measure, move Conor from a private school to a rough and tumble local public school replete with bullies and disinterested Priests as teachers and an abusive Principal. After being punched in the face by the school bully Barry (Ian Kenny) on his first day at the new school, Conor is befriended by Darren (Ben Carolan), a feisty, pint sized working class kid with flaming red hair and an impenetrable Dublin accent. Conor sees an elusive but beautiful girl (called Raphina - Lucy Boynton) in typical 80's dress and makeup hanging around outside school and he tries to impress her by claiming he has a band and would she like to be in their music video. Trouble is, Raphina takes him up on the offer and Conor turns to Darren to help recruit a band. First port of call is Eamon (Mark McKenna) who sports the most amazing collection of instruments, genuine natural musical talent and a supportive mother who allow practices in their living room and, after recruiting a cool black kid and two other boys, the band begins to take shape. Supported throughout Conor's growth as the band's lead singer and songwriter is the close bond with his College drop out, dope smoking but musically literate older brother Brendan (Jack Reynor) through the marital chaos of the parents.What emerges is a very real, authentic coming of age story of first love, overcoming bullying, brotherly love, family breakdown, growing fame as the band takes off and all the usual teenage issues of the age but because most the core cast are utterly normal teenagers, the whole things comes off as refreshing, real and uplifting as Conor, Eamon and Raphina and the band grow in proficiency and confidence.Perhaps the highlight of the movie is the band's practice for a school disco in the school hall where Conor and Darren (now band manager and video cameraman) enlist the support of girls to 'dance' in the foreground of a possible video. What actually emerges in the movie is Conor's fantasy recreation of the dance scene in ""Back to the Future"" and it features the band in full blown music video style with matching suits, an authentic '50's microphone and a school hall filled with dancers in '50's costumes who do a fantastic dance and band routine to rival anything from Glee or High School Musical done to an amazingly captivating and original toe tapping tune sung and played professionally by Conor and the band and featuring humorous cameos from various people important in his life.The backdrop of the growth of the band is the developing love interest between Conor and Raphina who seems on the verge of leaving her girls home and running off to England with her older boyfriend. Conor is constantly aware of his older competition but over time, because he writes his own lyrics and music and the band's huge progress in quality, she falls for him and the movie has an unexpected (if slightly unrealistic) ending. Walsh-Peelo, Boynton and McKenna are superb especially given the two boys were inexperienced on the big screen. Sing Street is a great look at teenage life in 1980's Dublin interspersed with well known '80's hits from Duran Duran, Aha, Joe Jackson, Depeche Mode and The Cure and is one of the best teen movies of the decade!"
" John Carney is a genius
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,9,"""Sing Street"" is a 2016 musical drama directed by John Carney starring Ferdia Walsh-Peelo and Lucy Boynton.
⚪
All in all, John Carney's third major directorial feature knows to capture the nostalgia and roughness of Ireland of the eighties, as well as the fears and desires of a teenager growing up in it, and thus becomes a heart-warming, extremely delighting and utterly inspiring coming of age story that is anything but formulaic. So far, I think that this feature here is by far the best of the highly acclaimed, and in my opinion, underrated director. Even if I think that his previous work ""Begin Again"" didn't really dare to fully thematize the dramatic conflicts of the situations it deals with, I still consider it to be a solid and fun film. In all his previous mainstream productions, musicality is a crucial factor and, in this case, it is not different. All the child actors are genuinely talented and show their impressive skills on their respective instruments, as well as in acting. Most of them are Irish newcomers, but it creates the charm in the first place, because they are teenagers who have no idea of how to live. Next to future superstars Lucy Boynton (""Bohemian Rhapsody"") as the desired lady and Jack Reynor (""Midsommar"") as the caring and influential brother, lesser known leading man Walsh-Peelo manages to portray his character superbly and give the audience someone they can identify with, and his character development is understandable as well. It cannot be denied that he was nothing but what is colloquially known as a ""simp"" in the beginning, but in the end, he was an amateur musician, a personality and someone who has learnt a lot about the world and himself. It started out with the silly idea to impress a girl and ends with a dream he dares to follow. The soundtrack is a sublime mix of iconic anthems of the eighties and features the works of bands like The Cure or Duran Duran (among others), as well as catchy and well composed original songs that make you smile immediately. It is not a bit kitschy, awkward or cheesy and the screenplay finds the perfect balance between humorous fun and coming of age drama, as the troubled family life and the desire to escape his hopelessness are pivotal themes in this film, but don't overshadowing the overall cheerful atmosphere. Also, I think that it awesome that it spotlighted the importance of brotherly love as well, and how they are mostly the ones who inspires the most, especially in music (I can relate to it, because it was exactly the same with me). In the end, it is a heart-warming, delighting, endearing and genuinely enjoyable film that is as authentic and original as it is does feel good, and shows that John Carney is a phenomenal director. Seriously, this film cheered me up so much and I encourage you to watch and experience it yourself."
" Not that bad
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,7,"Nice, youth and music.Charming, boring, and cute.Haunted by dreamsCountless Times"
" Cool, exiting, wonderful, amazing!
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie. It's one of my favourite films. I first saw it last year and I enjoyed it so much that I've seen it about 12 times or more. I love the story, the songs (The Riddle of the Model, Up, To Find You, A Beautiful Sea, Drive It Like You Stole It, Girls & Brown Shoes), the script, the cast (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Jack Reynor, Lucy Boynton, Don Wycherley, Mark McKenna, Ian Kenny, Aidan Gillen, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Kelly Thornton, Marcella Plunkett, Lydia McGuinness, Ben Carolan, and Percy Chamburuka)... Everything about this movie is wonderful. Me and my family enjoyed it very much. Greetings from Madrid!"
" Immy's review : Uplifting and full of charm
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,9,"I enjoyed this a lot. It was hilariously uplifting, smart and real. The movie won't fail to leave a smile on your face, whilst making you want to be a teenager again. Sing street excellently portrays the messy emotions, hopes and desires of teens, whether that be wanting to form a famous band or to get the girl of your dreams, all set in the backdrop of 1980s Ireland. If you're a fan of the 80's and popular bands at the time (I am), you will definitely enjoy this. I like how the movie never paints any of the characters as 'heroes' or significant people, but as just normal teenagers experiencing the normal emotions and conflicts of a young person. Everything is told through the filtered, fantasy-like lense of 15 year old Connor, so we only see things from his own self loathing feelings and ego, and thus we relate to him as if we were our younger selves. His acting was very believable, as he truly feels like the typical awkward teenager looking for more in life. I loved the music used in the film and the OST was especially enjoyable. I think I have about 4 of the songs downloaded on my Spotify! It was genius how each song was influenced by different events and people in his life. His influences, mainly from his older brother and Raphina, were evident in the songs and different styles and approaches he took to life, excellently showing how often his relationships with others were easier to communicate through art and song. His relationship with his brother was especially heartwarming to watch, who he often looked up to. The scenes where they shot the music videos were fun to watch, as despite the dodgy camera work and direction, it felt authentic and conveyed the naivety and youth very well. The pacing was spot on, detailing all the events in good timing and never straying from the focus on the protagonist. Although the ending could have been more realistic, I think it perfectly sums up the reckless and impulsive nature of young people, and who are so pressured by societies rules and expectations, that they will eventually escape and go their own way. Is it realistic? No. Is it needed? Absolutely. I think that's whats so good about this movie ; Unlike some other teen movies, it actually takes a liberal route and tells you follow your own dreams and to be who you want, completely bashing the system for what it is. For example, Connor wearing makeup and dressing more boldly ; Although a subtle part in the movie, the judgement he receives from not only his peers but also the mistreatment by his headmaster shines a light on teenage individuality and societal expectations. The acting was top notch from every actor, delivering some very humorous and characteristic lines throughout. One fault is that there could have been better chemistry between the two leads. However, overall a fun and uplifting little gem of a movie, with wonderful charm and a realistic look at how a 15 year old sees the world. Recommend!"
" Ferdia Walsh-Peelo is superb
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,10,"I have only recently seen this film which came out in 2016. I was about to switch off the TV (it was after 1.00 am) when this film started (on Film 4). I was immediately engaged. The film I'd just watched was Call me by your Name which I found unsatisfactory particularly after the hype it has had. Early in that film the family and the visitor were identified as Jewish. What had this to contribute to the story? I found neither of the leads empathetic. The Americano visitor seemed to acquire a special status for no better reason than that he was Americano. They fainted at the sight of his tepid dancing. (If you want to see dancing see Jean-Pierre Moulin in Klapisch's Paris.) In fact every move he made, no matter how tiresome, was marvelled at. The other lead had some quirky ways. He was adequate. Back to Sing Street. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo has more charisma in his little finger than the pair of leads in ""Call me ..."" put together. Sing Street is not perfect but its imperfections are minor. Indeed they add to the charm of the film. As well as charisma Ferdia Walsh-Peelo has a comedic gift. I do not see that he has appeared in other films since. This is a loss to the film industry. Or perhaps this is his own decision. (I left the Webber Douglas Academy after four terms as I had seen enough of the world of acting, the egos, the alcoholic bread and butter West End actors, the low level of intelligence of most actors - cf. Laurence Fox. We get one shot at life and I didn't wish to waste it in that milieu. In addition acting is for children as asserted by Anthony Hopkins, Richard Burton et al.) Occasionally there is a gem such as Ferdia Walsh-Peelo and it is unfortunate that he no longer appears to be sharing his talent. I concede that there are many talented actors who get dropped by the wayside. But we have recently heard much about the casting practices of Hollywood so perhaps... I have not laid out the storyline as that has been adequately covered already."
" Unexpected trip through 80s music
",2020-06-15 00:00:00,8,"The plot is simple, yet catches you since the first part of the movie because of the endearing characters. The plot joins a young boy from a middle-class family from Dublin which dysfunctional family is going through a difficult situation while trying to impress a girl by becoming what he has dream: a rock star. It explores the dreams of an innocent boy who struggles in a difficult world. The acting is natural and the development of characters is interesting and touching, the audience can easily relate with the problems the boy is facing at school. The soundtrack is amazing, with original songs that resembles the 80s style, like few are composed on these days. Moreover, it takes you through the story of early years of the most iconic bands from the era. The setting is beautiful, with different locations from Ireland which are exploit very well. The movie is complete, it has a good screenplay, soundtrack and locations; if additionally, you are into classics bands from the 80s like Duran Dura or The Cure, or simply likes the history of music, you will find this movie really enjoying."
" Very very nice movie
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,9,I dont know why this movie wasn t promoted by the media. Perhaps they didnt believe it. But I read lots of comments and 8+ critics. I saw this film by accident. Very nice plot and the (young) actors played very well. They got into the role. Really enjoyed watching an era I never lived but I wish I could.
" Fun, heart warming, bittersweet
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,9,Great movie to watch with your friends and family.
" Karl Rice
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,7,"10 second of authentic acting by this guy and everytime he was in the background, I was laughing ..."
" I love this movie
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,10,It was such a fun original movie! I'm really excited for the stage musical version of this because I think it will transfer brilliantly to stage!
" Dance to the beat of teen optimism. A unique coming of age story to captivate, reminisce and tap the feet to.
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,8,"Very few directors dedicate so much time to creating a compelling story with original music that enhances it to the max. Not only does this movie deals with heartbreaking scenarios ranging from broken families to lost shots at pursuing one's dreams but it provides an uplifting outcome to an otherwise hard childhood. It's impactful and touching, an essay on how to write songs really.While the movie feels like a love letter to 80s pop and what I can only interpret as a platonic representation of the Irish director's wishful younger life, the story does reminisce of those common 80s teen movies' tropes with romanticised interactions and situations like making friends, forming a band and meeting the girl when he just started in a new school. However these realistic aspects are made available in order for the real themes to take the center stage: dealing with the downsides of a broken family; thinking big, pursuing a passion and fighting against all odds; feeling appreciated, valuable and worthy of love; breaking the norms and looking to the future.IN CONCLUSION, it will speak volumes to anyone who's going through or has gone through the situations that are portrayed in this movie and which I have briefly mentioned. Otherwise, it is a musically-beautified coming of age tale with a bit overly-romanticised aspects but with the sole purpose of providing a feel-good and endearing movie to inspire. It almost feels autobiographical, like you are witnessing the start of a band you'd love to see but then again these movies are meant to show the human side of the band behind the IPs and commerical image. However, the movie doesn't care for that but rather focuses it in using music as a vessel to expressing emotions and dealing with real life"
" happy sad, silly cute
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,8,"The first love brings to a person not only the emotional initiation, but also the creative imagination full of poetry and the shape of the dream that appears. The brother teaches his love and knowledge of music to his younger brother without reservation and also plays the role of a mentor. That's so touching. John Carney's musical taste is simply amazing"
" Dreams and ambition.
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,"A movie about music, dreams and following your passion. Quite inspiring. Another feel-good movie with lots of love."
" A truly incredible piece
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,10,"It is a breathtaking film about two people that fall in love and a boy that finds his passion. This follows a boy named Connor that is now going to a new school because of his parents financial situation. He ends up meeting a model named Raphina, who he tells that he is in a band. Here's the thing, he's not in a bad. The rest of the is finding one's self. In this stance he finds himself through music.As well as a beautiful story, it has an amazing score that will have dancing along with the music. The writing is absolutely beautiful and honestly i wouldn't change anything about the movie.So give it a chance, you won't regret it."
" Exceeded my expectations
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,10,"When I first heard of this movie, I thought it sounded engaging and was looking forward to watching it over the weekend. It was so much better than I could have anticipated; I was tapping my foot throughout.I thought the film struck a good balance between sentimental and comical moments."
" Nice!
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,9,Finally a movie with SONGS! This soundtrack is awesome! The characters and the acting is good but the best thing in this film is the 80s feeling.
" I'm an 80's fan
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,10,"I absolutely love this film.
'Drive it like you stole it'
'To find you'
Favourite songs and so glad the director didn't choose the ending he wanted."
" Sweet Film
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,9,"Sing Street is one of the most touching and fresh coming of age films in years. Though it is rather formulaic, mostly due to it being an homage to 80s film styles, it is a beautiful modern musical. It is from the writer/director of Once, another musical that must be seen. I highly recommend."
" An Inspiration to Live
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,10,"This movie has no conflicts, there's no ups and downs - just constant ups. At first glance it seems as if the script
is simple and dry and that it required no creativity. It seems to be just about a kid and his teenage-band-fightingparents-inlove phase.But what makes Sing street different is that the protagonist begins with a clear identity. Which is the typical ending/resolution of a coming of age movie. In Sing streets he begins by not giving a damn about his toxic, unloving parents. And his journey was simply living life to 'really living life'.The film dips into deep topics and characters that live with them. And is tied together through a bands passion for music. This film really reminds you of your problems but inspires you and reminds you that they don't mean much, that this is your one life and seems to resurface you're passions.Its and inspiration to live."
" Cheerful and Uplifting
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed the creative musical numbers in the film, particularly the Riddle of the Model sequence. The characters were all interesting and fun to watch. The movie is also very inspiring and uplifting, and definitely promotes a great perspective on how to deal with challenges in life. The only misstep the film has is its ending, which did not seem to know how to resolve it. Also, I thought that the musical numbers at the end of the movie with the concert were not as emotionally impactful as they needed to be for it to feel like a proper climax and resolution. Overall, however, I enjoyed the movie a lot."
" Awesome
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,8,"Untill the end of it, i tought if there was a little bit more about the boy and the girl that'd be much better or the same thing with the band or the bully boy. But at the very end of the movie everything i thought was washed away and i was amazed. The movie is actually about two brothers like it shows at the end. Worth to see."
" Feel good factor 9/10
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,9,"What a lovely film. So many positives. If you need a lift try this.
And its got a great soundtrack too."
" Really touching, and has a lot scenes that I could empathize with
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,10,"I just re-watched this movie. And still I enjoyed as much as I did when I watched for the first time. This movie has message that I can totally empathize with. In my childhood, I moved many times because of my dad's job. Every time I moved to unfamiliar place, I felt separated from the environment and friends. However I could find one specific thing which I could get really into and be enthusiastic of. This movie illustrates main characters struggling with the world they are in they don't know what to chase in their future. This whole situation has a lot things I have common with. Some would say this movie was cheesy and stupid melodrama... but I think this movie is super nice and I found it really touching."
" Charming, Heartfelt and Uplifting Coming of Age Gem
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,10,"This movie is just perfect. A charming, heartfelt, and uplifting coming of age story that will leave you motivated to fulfill your dreams. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo gives a genuine performance. He is a sweet, naive, and rebellious boy. Lucy Boynton is so beautiful and mesmerizing in the movie that you wouldn't be able to take your eyes off her. Her character is well written and given depth. Conor's big brother, played by Jack Reynor is great. He is supportive, helps him to create good music, and wants best for him. The rest of the characters are also very well written and acted. The direction is impressive, and the movie never feels boring. The screenplay written by John Carney is outstanding and genuine.The best thing about the movie is the songs. Inspired by the music of Duran Duran and The Cure. All the original songs performed in this film are amazing. Some will fill you with joy, and some will make you emotional. The story, the characters, and the songs will keep you hooked to the screen. Definitely, worth a watch."
" Best irish movie
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,9,"I'm not vary watcher of Irish films after this I'm going to check some Irish films it,s a musical,romantic drama about guys of sing street very well writtened and executed film,musical gave some thoughts about life"
" Poetic, cool, brilliant, beautiful, and touching. This is a film that will make you smile, cry, sing, and dream.
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,10,"Brendan (Jack Reynor): ""This is life, Connor. Drive it like you stole it.""My children and I discovered this jewel only this year (3 years after the film was released!). My youngest daughter just made a film with Ferdia (a super talented actor and a wonderful, sweet and beautiful guy) and we wanted to see Ferdia in this movie.Sing Street is an absolutely amazing movie. It's poetic, cool, brilliant, beautiful, and touching. The writing (John Carney) is superb, the music is really really really cool and the cast (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, Jack Reynor, Lucy Boynton, Don Wycherley, Mark McKenna, Ian Kenny, Aidan Gillen, Maria Doyle Kennedy, Kelly Thornton, Marcella Plunkett, Lydia McGuinness, Ben Carolan, and Percy Chamburuka) is absolutely wonderful.Sing Street talks about the innocence of the first love, the bound between brothers, the lack of communication between parents and teenagers, the importance of pursuing one's dreams, and the power of music, art, and friendship. John Carney succeeds on bringing all of that and more to the screen without falling into empty cliches and with great mastery. And the British music from the 80s... Wow. Such a treat! This is a film that will make you smile, cry, sing, and dream.My children (ages 13, 11 and 6) love Sing Street and have watched the film 7 times already (we bought the DVD and have a cinema projector at home). They know all the songs sung by Ferdia by heart (we also bought the soundtrack) and my oldest daughter almost knows the whole script by heart too. But this is a film for all ages. I was also very impressed by this film (its poetry and sweetness overwhelmed me) and can't get the songs out of my head.If you didn't see this gem yet, watch it, watch it, watch it. If you saw it in 2016: watch it again. You'll enjoy it a lot. I promise.The best: the script, the music, Connor's journey, Ferdia, Jack, Lucy, and the Freud poster.The worst: nothing.10 / 10"
" A complete movie
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,10,A good hearted movie that hits all the correct notes. A must watch for anyone that loves movies.
" With this film, Carney cements himself as one the great musical directors of all time
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,10,"I saw Once (Carney's first major film) about a year ago. I immediately purchased Begin Again and Sing Street from Amazon after completing it. I watched Begin Again about 2 days after it arrived. And I loved that film as well. But I delayed watching Sing Street for as long as I could. The reason was simple you can only watch a film for the first time once and I didn't want to rush seeing this man's work. I finally gave in and watched Sing Street last night. I am glad I waited and glad I gave in. Like Once and Begin Again, Sing Street is a brilliant film that fits comfortably within the musical genre while being atypical low-key and intimate.Sing Street is a classic boy meets girl tale centered in Dublin in the mid-80's. A young artistic teenage struggle to find his voice while trying to woo a slightly older girl; their budding love is contrasted with the humanly dysfunctional home life of both and the strife of being in school. It has all the major story beats you expect. There is a bully character. There is a sequence of the straight-laced elders not understanding the teens artistic expression. The older libertine brother of the teen is a voice of wisdom and of warning. Carney's script, much like Begin Again being a reworked A Star is Born, conforms to the coming of age tale. What sets it apart is the details. It contains every story beat one would desire. It is has personal (it is clearly inspired by Carney's life) authentic vibe to it that makes the tropes real again.But the glory of this film is the direction. The handheld quasi-documentary camera work-especially in the musical scenes-strips the artifice from the story and it truly makes you feel connected to these characters. The movie feels utterly real especially in the precise nature of the teen's naïve attempts to be creative. The direction is beguiling in how it makes spectacle out of intimacy. The film contains a very inventive camera pan that works as a time jump cut, it also has a in narrative fantasy sequence for one of its songs. It somehow manages to keep the film very close and low key but also bold and striking in its grandeur in both sequences. It turns the musical form back onto itself and completes the re-invention of the form started in Once.The music is, of course, wonderful. It is by the same composer as much of the music from Once. It has the same raw but poignant energy to it. More than that it feels as if the characters are creating it. It has the youthful quality it should. It is good but unpolished. The simple elegance you would expect from a gifted teenage.I adore this film so much."
" This film feels like a hug
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,10,"I have to be honest, I only decided to watch this film because of the actress Lucy Boynton, who I really like, and I had no expectations whatsoever. The first 10 minutes felt like an ordinary british film, and my only motivation was to wait for Boynton to appear in the screen. But quickly, she was not the only element that made me want to watch the whole thing.
Suddenly, I realized that the film was not about music (specifically), it was about dreams and friends.
Halfway through it, I was really deepened, and in love with all the characters.
Just watch it, it's a good way to spend your night and will learn something from it."
" My wife and I loved this
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,10,It's just beautiful and as a wanna be rockstar in his twenties the resonance squeezed the heart. Great characters and a genuine love story
" Teenage kicks
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,5,"Sing Street is a feelgood teen film that is obviously inspired by those 1980s John Hughes teen comedy.Fourteen year old Conor Lawlor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) parent's are facing money worries and relationship troubles. He has to move schools and ends up in a severe Christian school. Brother Baxter picks on him because he dos not wear the correct black shoes and he also falls foul of the school bully.He makes friends with fellow schoolmate Darren and they together decide to form a band. Pretty wannabe model Raphina shoots the band's video as they aim to play at the end of term school concert. Conor falls for the slightly older Raphina but she already has a boyfriend.Sing Street has a light plot and thin characterisation. Everyone wants to live a better life and not the one their parents have. Raphina wants to run away to London even with no money. It did feel like bits of other similar movies put together.When it comes to a place and time, the film is all over the place. At one point Conor's family watch Duran Duran's video of Rio and act like it's the first time they are seeing the band. So you think it is 1982. Then you have A-ha's Take on Me and mention of Back to the Future so it must be late 1985 or 1986. Then you get Starship's We built this City that was released in 1987. Then there is Conor's brother mentioning priests abusing kids. It might not even be in the 1980s at all."
" Awesome
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,10,I'm 48 and love music. I love this movie! Took me back to the perfect 80's.
" Lovely movie
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,10,"Very kind and entertaining movie. I like such kind movies, what you can believe and enjoy. Of course, I understand the hard situation of the main characters, but it is very well-served, the script is well-written, funny. The characters are loveable. (I especially liked the older brother! :) )."
" One of my favourites
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,10,"Like previous reviewers I genuinely wasn't expecting much- but what a wonderful fairy tale with a superb message.
I'm 48, so would have been the exact age of the characters back in the 80's - and I was also in my first band - so nostalgia is playing a big part in my review. But I believe that anyone from any era could watch this and have nothing but praise. It's simple, understated even, but with a fantastic original soundtrack, cast and script that left me both laughing and crying at the same time- in the best way possible.
While Feargal Sharkey wrote about Teenage Kicks- with all its hopes and dreams, this film displays it in a way that will encourage you to never waste a precious moment - as anything is possible. Enjoy!"
" YOU could make a film better than this
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,5,"Overated tripe, a singer who can't keep in tune with terrible songs, enjoy for the dumb storyline."
" Take on me..
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,9,"I've watched SingStreet a number of times.. As someone who likes 80s flicks and 80s tunes this is what nostalgia is all about.
A story that not makes you think that what is life without a little risk in tough times but how important it is to be yourself ( a little cheesy) great acting throughout with nice good laugh at so many Irishism's throughout.
Sing street is a classic. Check it out. I know you'll dig it."
" The music is great
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,10,"This film works in so many levels, but I will stick to the music: Sing Street explores the musical genres of the 80s and 90s and brilliantly combines them together. The band's first song is written in the New Romantics style as a reference to Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet, ""Beautiful Sea"" is a nod at The Cure (Cosmo even stands and plays guitar like Robert Smith) and ""Drive It Like You Stole It"" combines the rhythm of Hall and Oates' ""Maneater"" with Joe Jackson's chords from the ""Stepping Out"" era. ""Brown Shoes"" is more like a 90s song with the distorted guitars. Brilliant job of the musical director!"
" I love this soundtrack!
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,7,"Sing Street is an entertaining watch for anyone who wanted to be in a band when they were younger. Plus, this movie is full of classic 80s music and toe-tapping original tunes, which is a bonus. It's a slower film with a simple plot (the runtime is padded with full-length songs), but the kids do a good job with the acting and I found myself smiling through most of it. If nothing else, you should at least listen to the soundtrack."
" An 80s Irish High School musical
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,4,"I wanted so much from this movie, but the longer it went on the more disappointed I became.
I wanted some Irish grit, but it only delivered gloss.
The songs were way too polished and the story line too sanitised."
" THE BEST.
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,10,"My favourite movie of all time, when I first watched it I didn't speak for an hour afterwards.this movie introduced so much great music into my life. I wanted to call my baby brother 'cosmo'. the way family was portrayed in this movie hit home a lot, I could relate to the older brother character, being the oldest myself. the constant fighting of the parents at home, the breakup. I could connect with the feeling 'I got to get out of Ireland if I ever want to get anywhere with my dreams'.I will always come back to this movie, it means a lot to me. Plus it's so much fun to watch man, the music and the band I just want to be in the band with them! you feel like you are during the movie. the school of rock was a major reason I took up guitar, this movie makes me want to keep playing.
WATCH IT MAN. THANK YOU FOR THIS MOVIE."
" A perfect 80's movie
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,10,"This is the sort of movie that reminds you why you love film. It's simple, realist yet oodly wonderful. I am a massive of 80's music and the soundtrack did not disappoint!!"
" Feel good movie with a beat
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,5,Classic tail of unrequited love. A guy forms a band to get the girl ... it's a enjoyable yet flawed film . Unlike a friend who aspires to be a a film critic ala Mark Kermode. It's not a classic but it is watchable.
" Nostalgic
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,10,"Sing Street. New film by the writer/director of Once (and the slightly less brilliant Begin Again). A coming of age tale set in 80s Dublin, with a similar musical theme to Once. A heart warming and nostalgic 9 out of ten. Gets better the more you see it"
" Youth at its best
",2018-09-27 00:00:00,10,"I am a third generation Irish American with family from Kilkee and Cork. My father was taught by Christian Brothers. My brother was taught by Jesuits and myself by Cistercians. My sister was taught by the Ursulines. My nephews are named Conor and Brendan, just like in the movie. I mention these things to qualify an obvious prejudice in my assessment the film, ""Sing Street"", and I am as profoundly moved by the film, if not more, than I was with Carney's first film, ""Once.""In ""Sing Street,"" to say Carney has captured the zeitgeist is an understatement and profoundly unfair. Carney has captured: a hope, a dream, a vision, a culture, a spark, a conscience, a respect, a soul, a smile, a tear, a visual and lyrical heartbeat of joy, sadness, pride, honor, tragedy and loneliness. LOVE. The film brought me back in time, to a place that transcends nostalgia. It transported me to a dreamlike reality that exists in my mind when I close my eyes for a brief moment and I wish for the bravery to not worry like an adult and oftentimes shouldn't. Like ""Back to the Future"" except so very, very real. So many parts of ""Sing Street"" resonates with the humanity, humility, fear and excitement of being alive and present in this world. It was done through so many perspectives and managed to not drown out any one character's voice. Carney is modern day Shakespeare in eye, word and note. As a young man, I dreamt of doing what Carney has done on the screen. John Carney, please don't ever stop creating these masterpieces and if possible, let me help you and your team in contributing an astounding chapter in the history of cinematic storytelling. Often I think I am alone on an inexplicable journey through chaos in this world. Not once, but twice Carney has spoken to me and millions with thoughtful and profoundly creative films that share in so many dimensions. (Full transparency, I haven't seen the second film but will do so in order to make my own conclusions about Keira Knightly.)Do yourself a favor and watch this film."
" Incredible,hidden gem
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,10,I only gave 5 stars to 31 films and it is very rare for me to give 5 star but this movie deserves it. Best movie I have watched this year. I would say it is mix of Almost Famos and The Perks of Being a Wallflower and it has something special. The songs are amazing and really catchy. It was hidden gem for me and I recommend this movie to everyone out there especially younger generations.
" Hidden Gem
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,8,"This lived up to every expectation I had upon it, a fantastic film with your fairly generic plot that's executed to perfect degrees. Brilliant original music and an amazingly good soundtrack there's so much to love, the cast are all great and is fairly recognisable and in general it's just an easy watch about Bortherly love and dreams. An easy to watch 'dromedy' the film 'Sing Street' is worth your time"
" Fun, fluid movie, about love and support
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,8,"Very good soundtrack. That's just one reason why you should watch this movie and there's many more. Fun, fluid movie, about love and support basically, between brothers and between teenage boy and girl with a dream."
" Truly my favorite movie
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,10,"I am honestly struggling to find words to describe this movie and why i love it as much as I do. 
Sing Street is a movie I randomly picked up on a flight two years ago. Though I didn't head into this movie with a particularly high expectation, considering I had never watched any of John Carney's previous works, what I found was utterly delightful. The movie, to me at least, feels real. the acting in this movie is fantastic which made the characters felt like real people. Their struggles suddenly felt real, and that's what made it so enjoyable."
" WHEN DREAMS MEET REALITY...!
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,10,"What a beautiful feeling it is when you follow your dreams... Sing Street follows this maxim to its fullest as a notion takes shape in the form of a band during the 80's music vid heyday in Ireland. As his world crumbles around him, his parents are breaking up, navigating a new school replete w/bullies & despotic Catholic figureheads, our hero, w/the unflinching support of his stoner brother, starts a band w/a bunch of fellow pariahs hoping just to shoot a music video to impress the older girl who has caught his eye but what he gains is self-confidence, wisdom beyond his years & also a knack for writing catchy songs. Not a bad trade-off for this heartwarming, inspiring yarn that tickled me delighted & left me w/a healthy dose of nostalgia."
" Good vibrations, great 80s nostalgia, good indie film but...
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,5,"I really enjoyed the music, the acting, the cinematography, the story. But here's the but...There were a few scenes with the lead actor singing that felt completely out of kilter with the era. I suspect they were added to sell to a younger generation or to promote a new star?Hopefully there will be a shorter Director's cut and then this film will be up there with The Commitments and Gregory's Girl."
" It's like an updated Commitments.
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,8,"Love this!! It's like an updated Commitments. Slightly less grimy, but still with enough miserable reality to tick that box. It's a lot more hopeful though and sweet. Actually it's not really like The Commitments at all. The Commitments is not sweet. While that film smacks of hope, what's on screen is brutal, dirty and real. Sing Street is a different beast. It's romantic and full of youthful abandon, great music and three fantastic characters in Ferdio Walsh-Peelo (awesome name), Lucy Boynton and the scene stealing Jack Reynor. I defy anyone with a heart to watch this and not gasp, smile and want to punch the air. Fantastic stuff."
" Drive it like you stole it.
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,8,"I had forgotten how utterly full of joy and hope Sing Street is, about a teenager growing up in 80s working class Dublin who refuses to simply lie down and accept the cards that have been dealt to him. That this revelatory journey begins with a casual fib to try and impress a pretty girl is apt; Cosmo falls into the juvenile trap of pretending to be someone else for another, but we marvel as he climbs out of that trap and comes of age in the process. The film has touches of the usual kitchen-sink realism, but avoids the pitfalls of completely swooping down to that gloomy level. Cosmo finds his own solace, slamming the door on his parent's screaming and returning to strumming his acoustic guitar. They're so poor he can't even afford a new pair of black school shoes, but sports winged lashes and rebellious streaks in his hair. Editors Andrew Marcus and Julian Ulrichs make heartbreak and highlights out of the way he retreats into musical daydream, alternating close-ups of Conor's twitching face and an unmoving set of doors before seamlessly shifting into a full blown dream sequence. That 'dress rehearsal' of their smash hit ""Drive It Like You Stole It"" speaks to Sing Street at its best: loud, brash, and bold, with songs that serenade a life at its breaking point. The scene features an eye-popping colour scheme, sitcom-esque high key lighting, and a wacky ensemble of characters emerging from the crowd in even wackier costumes. If only life were like this. But the boys and their band make their own magic, evolving from a rag-tag bunch in a makeshift setup next to a back alley dumpster. Their music is their bond and their escape; for Cosmo an avenue to splatter his heartache onto notation (even as it is too late for his college-dropout older brother, who reveals his own obscured failings in a startling monologue), for schoolyard bully Barry a chance to escape his abusive, dead-end household. Cosmo sets his heart on Lucy Boynton's Raphina, a model with an elven elegance about her, and a wardrobe that sees her walk straight off a magazine cover. The relationship is so unbalanced it's almost unfair; Cosmo has already fallen in love before their first conversation, while Raphina's juggling another pretty boy - no, man - on the side. In a classic move, he projects a whole range of fantasies and ideals onto the model, making her the centre of his attention and first music video. Yet John Carney unravels this fairy tale with such finesse, stripping away the mystique from a girl who is in reality only a year older than Conor, and a lot less worldlier than he really thinks. Only then can they be true to themselves, and then each other. I'm still not as captivated by the ending as I was by the finale of Carney's 2007 masterpiece Once, which seemed to stick truer to the characters. Sometimes romance and real life are at odds with each other, and it takes strength to admit it. What Cosmo and Raphina set off to achieve isn't entirely implausible, but it's brave, far braver than anything else they have aspired to in their short lives (Carney shoots it almost like the prom sequence, the boundary between fantasy and reality hazy). But they're futurists, after all. Nostalgia and cover bands are a thing of the past, for those still sulking around in Dublin. Their time is now. Grab the wheel and own it."
" Best Music Movie
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,10,"Best Music Movie i've ever seen. Good acting, great characters and of course lovely music :)"
" CRIMINALLY UNDERRATED
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,9,"It's criminal how underrated this film is! All the songs are great, and the storyline was so in tune with reality. I went in to see another teen movie about the struggles of reaching your dream, but I got so much more. Life in a broken home, blind devotion, repairing friendships, it was all so beautifully done and all seemed really smooth.I can understand that certain elements of the film may not make it suitable for worldwide distribution (the romance between two minors is prime example), but damn. This is criminally underrated, and arguably more enjoyable than the other musical film that stole 2016."
" What a great movie!
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,10,Just caught this on Netflix. What a surprise! Great movie with catchy music. Reminded me of being in Dublin as a teen in the early 80s. So cute.
" A movie about becoming
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,9,"This movie could have failed SO hard. It could have felt cliche or teen movie-ish or like it was trying too hard. But Carney somehow captures the magic again. The story feels fresh, and the characters feel real. Every time the band changed style and sound, I thought ""yes."" Because the movie chose not to be about arriving somehow...but about becoming. About trying. About failing. That is where ""Begin Again"" faltered, honestly. And that real-ness allowed the predictable moments here to be not just forgiven but embraced. As the music gelled and the people connected, you just had to cheer."
" Brilliant of life.
",2017-11-09 00:00:00,9,"""Your problem is that you're not happy being sad, but that's what love is, Cosmo: happy-sad.""Good songs,flawless actors,best movie of 2016. Every scenes make me want to dance. This is the type of movie I pray never disappears. Just gold. 9/10"
" Great Period Piece
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,9,"Really captures its time, has a wonderful soundtrack, and a great concept. Does a really good job communicating the tone and the feeling of the plot, and none of the actors felt like actors. There were very many things done very well in this movie and very few things that noticeably would need improvement. It'd be an 8 in my books if not for just how well it captured 1980s Dublin. It definitely added to the film experience. If you're looking for a good film with good humour that tells a good story, this would be great option."
" Amazing Irish movie.
",2017-09-20 00:00:00,9,"Fantastic Irish movie, I remember that I was in Ireland. John Carney is one of my favorite directors. His other films are also great. The movie is as great as I expected. I love his sense of music and world. I need always something like the movie young memory.I love it."
" Most Under-appreciated Movie of 2016- Great Soundtrack
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,10,"Wow. What an absolutely beautiful film. It is so simple. It is about teenagers in a band. But the humor is so well-timed, and the music so...awesome...that it is a real pleasure to watch. I only heard about Sing Street because of its Golden Globe nomination (which it completely deserved) and didn't watch it on Netflix until well through 2017. I regret not seeing it sooner.One of the great parts of Sing Street is that the teenagers are actually played by teenagers, not 20 year-olds pretending to be 14 (cough cough Spider-man). They're really believable kids, and just so likable. Their personal stories are interesting and the way they see the world is fascinating to experience. It all feels very real.Sing Street also has an INCREDIBLE SOUNDTRACK that compliments the story so well. Up is my favorite.Jack Reynor totally deserved his Irish Oscar. He was such a REAL older brother. I did it again, and said how real it felt. That's part of the beauty of the film. It just feels real. But back to Jack Reynor. I didn't know him from anything else, but he was so good in this that when I first saw his face as a racist cop in Detroit (a SUPER intense film) that I actually laughed. Thanks Sing Street.Must see film. Just bunny stuff."
" Sweet Story
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,8,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film. I rooted for the main character from the start. Really captured the angst of being a teenager and the transformation and power one can achieve through creating. Despite some sexual references, drug use and bad language, I think it is fine for all ages."
" A real joy
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,8,"A teenage boy in 1980's Dublin forms a band to impress a girl. His discovery of music helps him negotiate his chaotic domestic situation and the tough Catholic school he attends. A really interesting blend of well-told coming-of-age drama with music from the 80's. As our protagonist hears new styles of music, his style and the type of music he writes changes to reflect his new interests, so while he starts writing poppy tunes, he's soon writing music influenced by The Cure, Spandau Ballet and Hall & Oates. It works primarily because the songs written by director Carney are all really good and reasonable facsimiles of music from this time and place."
" One of the most fun and genuine movies I've seen in a while.
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,9,This is one of the most fun and genuine movies I've seen in a while. The most basic and tried concept of a guy starting a band to impress a girl is executed with such freshness and color. And when the music starts playing you will wish Sing Street was a real band. Easily one of my favorite movie bands. The acting was surprisingly good and Lucy Boynton performance was fantastic. Sing Street is an absolute gem and I promise you will feel younger by just watching it.
" Musical coming of age gold!!
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,10,"I have to start this recommendation by saying that I'm a HUGE fan of the director John Carney. 'Once' is one of my all time favorite movies and I love his style and blend of original music with storytelling. Here we have a really great coming of age story about a young boy (Conor) that has to adjust to changing home life as well as a nightmarish new school, how does he manage this...music. For anyone who enjoyed music growing up it'd be hard to deny that it helps shape youths as well as often help you cope or breathe hope and joy into the everyday challenge of just figuring out life as you mature. That pretty much is the essence of the story, listening to and creating his own music is the tool to help him get the girl of his dreams and possibly forge a new future in the backdrop of a jobless and fairly lifeless Dublin, Ireland of the mid 1980s. The original music from the movie is fantastic and it sounds like it could have been released at the same time as many of the bands Conor is influenced by such as 'Duran Duran', and 'The Cure.' The whole admiration of music and specifically the new era of music video as a new art is all really authentic, and to me his brother Brenan really is the best character in the movie as the idealist pothead who wants his brother to chase the dreams he didn't. Their final moment together was probably the best part of the movie.Its rare that I watch a movie that I want to see again immediately after I see it but that's precisely how I felt. This really is unique and has something to offer everyone from drama, laughs, and a few tugs on the heartstrings all set to a back drop of really great music.A MUST SEE!!"
" Great movie.

Music is a beautiful thing and this film shows an example of how it cannot be repressed or contained, how it is a tool for reforming people, and coping with situations.And art is an attractive thing.

" Get some things but fail in others
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,5,"As a beautiful movie, to achieve dreams, that's fine. Now, as a film in itself, cinematic, it is a little scarce. It's nice, but little else.The director does not know how to finish it, the end is a little I want and I can not, when you see that it's coming, you start to ask yourself. See how you're going to do it? And for my pleasure I do not know how to take it.While it is true that there is a sequence that I will explain in the spoiler zone, I almost get something I have always wondered how you could roll well, like saying that dreaming is bad because then comes the sad reality.The actors are all very well. The romance between the two is beautiful, although I think it would be better if I had not managed to conquer it. For my taste is spent in the locker room, but you can accept.Photography, no big deal, is a white camera video and does not care much.The direction aside from not knowing how to finish it and not know how to do a staging and not know how to take advantage of the concert moments to make beautiful plans that accompany the splendid soundtrack. But at least he likes to see her. You are drawn to the story.He has a music, which is the best thing unlike the movie.Spoiler: In the sequence of the concert at school, when he starts to dream, it almost gives you the feeling that it is bad to dream, it lacks a little rise and fall of blow but it is quite well achieved."
" A Heartwarming Film that is Ridiculous Fun,
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,9,"Sing Street is an outstanding movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a real feel good, sweet movie that is a pure delight for anyone familiar with the eighties, the setting and atmosphere makes it convey very clear that we are in a very different time in Ireland. The original songs are magnificent, each one being annoyingly catchy and serving the plot very well. It is immensely funny, but also stands out in more dramatic moments that are mildly tense, and very real. The only aspect of the film that I did not particularly appreciate was the parents plot line. It was clearly trying to add an extra layer of difficulty to Conor's life, but it failed to grab me in any way. I did not care for his two dimensional mother and father, nor did I have any interest on seeing how their relationship pans out. The strongest part of the movie has to be Conor and Brendan's special brotherly bond, it is sweet, pure and I think any pair of brothers can relate to it. With the teasing that goes on between them, as well as the sincere care they both have for one another, the ending brought a tear to my eye as a result of how powerful Ferdia Walsh-Peelo and Jack Reynor's relationship was. It made me experience many different emotions throughout, which is what the best movies do. Funny, heartwarming and wildly entertaining, Sing Street is worth the watch for anyone who is looking for a good comedy or music film. A young boy starts a band in order to get an older girls attention. Best Performance: Jack Reynor"
" What a delight
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,8,"I'm about 40 years older than the demographic this is aimed at, but I really like this. It's not only a love story, it is a story of love between brothers, and a love song to 80s pop music. Solid acting, pacing, sounds, writing...really not a thing to complain about here. It's your life/ Drive it like you stole it not only deserves the song awards it got, it's a great piece of advice. I like the bit at the end with the ship. It makes the ending more than a simple, sappy thing. But you're still left with a smile."
" Riddle of The Singer
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,7,"Hoping to impress a girl, a 1980s teen starts a band and awakens a genuine passion for music beyond meeting girls in this amiable drama from Ireland. The chemistry between the protagonist and his friends feels real, the sourced song soundtrack is top notch and the band come up with several memorable 80s-style tunes of their own. The film's best aspect though is how it taps into the rising popularity of music videos in the mid-1980s with a superb analysis of Duran Duran's 'Rio' clip, plus an awesome segment in which the friends film a video clip of their own (""The Riddle of the Model"") and absolutely nail it right down to the long flowing costumes. What exists here beyond the basic story of a bunch of friends and their love of music is somewhat less interesting. There are standard bullies, nasty teachers who abuse their powers and our hero has a rather humdrum dysfunctional home life. Unremarkable as these aspects of the film may be, the film still stacks up quite well overall since the music is so often in focus. There is also a delightful portion of the film heavily influenced by the prom sequence in 'Back to the Future', and while the protagonist's strained relationship with his parents does not resonate too much, he has some great moments alone with his college dropout older brother who rues the fact that he was the first born and had to suffer their unstable home life for longer."

" A real tonic of a movie
",2017-04-12 00:00:00,8,"John Carney's ""Sing Street"" is much closer to ""The Commitments"" than it is to ""Once"" but like ""Once"" it's on a much smaller scale, (a kind of ""Bugsy Malone"" version of ""The Commitments""), but if the scale is small both its heart and its humour are pretty massive and its mostly young cast are fabulous, (and the adults aren't half bad either). You could write the plot on a pinhead, (boy meets girl, boy starts band, boy gets girl), but plot is the last thing you go to a movie like this for, There's more tonic in ""Sing Street"" than there is in a dozen pints of plain."
" Great Music, Great Acting, Great Story
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,9,"I really was not expecting to like Sing Street since I am not a fan of quirky teenage movies (I was very wrong by assuming this movie was that kind of movie). At the end of the movie I stood with satisfaction and a smile in my face.This movie has very good and well-rounded characters that give depth to the story and help you get invested in their lives. I believe that the characters are the best part of this film, I really got to understand the motivations of all the characters and a little bit of backstory.The music is great as well, every song (original and soundtrack) is really catchy and goes hand in hand with the tone of the film.Another aspect I really liked about the film was its style. The color grading in the movie is wonderful and the cinematography is very good.I could say that the pacing in the movie is kind of off, because at the beginning it moves really fast and then kind of slows by the end. In my opinion, the end has a better pace than the beginning but that is just a nitpick."
" Sing Street is upbeat, charming, and sensational for music fans everywhere
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,9,"This teen musical dramedy paints the nostalgia of classic teen flicks from the 80s, and arguably the early days of teen musicals like 'Grease'. Most importantly, it is almost exactly what a teen-oriented musical piece needs to be. It is funny, it is charming, it is upbeat, and it boasts a cast of characters that are thoroughly likable; not to mention the exhilarating musical numbers that take place. Jim Carney, the man behind the dramedy 'Begin Again' is the conductor behind this project. Carney is a genius who captures the innocence of youth and the thoughtful wonders of following your dreams. Although some may consider this just your average high school musical comedy, this claim feels a bit of an understatement. In the age where the teen musical genre is long past its hay days from the late 70s and 80s, this is one of those rare flicks of the genre that really works. Set in 1985 Dublin, this follows 14-year old Conor (played by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo), a misunderstood high school teenager stuck in his broken home life with his bickering parents and his lazy older brother Brendan (played by Jack Reynor). Upon meeting a cute model Raphina (played by Lucy Boynton), Conor forms a rock band with a group of outcasts including Eamon (played by Mark McKenna), Ngig (played by Percy Chamburuka), Larry (played by Conor Hamilton), Garry (played by Karl Rice), and Barry (played by Ian Kenny) in efforts to impress her.It is been a long time since Richard Linklater's 'School of Rock' the last time Hollywood has deliver such an electrifying feel-good musical comedy like this one. This film operates with immense charm and lyrical optimism, and the musical performances by the young cast provide more than a hefty hand for fueling this film's elegant appeal. Ferdia Walsh-Peelo provides an appealing force to be reckon with his singing. Every scene the band play, his voice shines like gold. The musical numbers are far from the classic-type songs that will leave a lasting appeal for many years to come, but they are very lively and not impossible for pinning viewers with the urge to stand up and cheer. The music leaves plenty of room for alluring nostalgia of popular rock music from the 80s. When the atmosphere is not flowing with musical numbers, there is a share humor to handed from the wide cast of characters. The lead character in particular is strongly likable, along with the supporting characters he recruits into his band. One of the sparkling points to the story is the chemistry between Peelo and Lucy Boynton, a romance that while nothing necessarily remarkable, definitely fuels the groovy atmosphere. Jack Reynor who plays the lead character's older brother is quite likable as well, a character who's stuck on the sidelines of the world of adult responsibilities. This guy comes as a form of inspiration to the lead character's optimism and willingness to success.Sing Street is a heartwarming, feel-good musical comedy with an appeal that is nearly irresistible. This movie is an elegant surprise that is likely to appeal to more than just the crowd of music fanatics. Jim Carney sets out to orchestrate a sensational music-based entry, and it excels greatly here, if not breaking any grounds."
" What a big surprise !
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,9,"This movie was amazing . Little did I know about the film but I was amazed. The film passes on a message of courage, not to be afraid of risking, in this case in the formation of the band as in the conquest by the girl that he liked. The music in the film is very good, a tribute to several bands, the interpretations are solid, the story is good since their problems at home, their relationship with the older brother (I loved the relationship), their integration into the Catholic school, the conquest of the girl of your dreams The end of the film also pleased me, a happy ending, in the attempt to search for his dream, in an attempt to be something more than I could ever be in Ireland. It is mandatory to watch this movie."
" Neither happy nor sad...
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,5,"""Sing Street"" premises 14-year-old Conor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) forming a band and becoming the star of his own bleak reality. Good! Compelling! Why does he start a band? So he can impress the pretty girl hanging out, by herself, on the stairs across his school! Oh. That's the point when I almost lost my just awoken interest. But, as ""Sing Street"" features one of my favourite actresses, I wanted to give it a try.It is set in 1980's Ireland: the viewer is thrown into a world of unemployment, Catholicism, racism, and boredom. I enjoyed the stabs at society, although the message would've been clear even with a lesser use of the word ""faggot"". Noteworthy are the performances of Lucy Boynton, Maria Doyle Kennedy and Jack Reynor. Boynton succeeds to deliver cheesy lines believably and with dignity. (Raphina: ""Your problem is that you're not happy being sad. But that's what love is, Cosmo. Happy sad."" Damn she's like what, 15? I hate when teenagers get BS lines dripping with ""profoundness"". Yes, ""The Fault in Our Stars"", I'm rolling my eyes at you). Boynton is able to breathe fresh life into a somewhat cardboard-y, stereotypical character. In this way, her character (Raphina) became the most accessible to me. Maria Doyle Kennedy, who I know and love from Canadian TV series ""Orphan Black"", portrays the wife who's had it. Although she doesn't get a lot of screen time, her portrayal is convincing and a highlight. Reynor plays the oldest brother: he's definitely got the best lines and makes the viewer root and hope for Brendan. Another plus is the setting. The film depicts beautiful shots of Irish scenery, green and lush. Furthermore, the movie's colour scheme and tone, in their subtlety, provide real candy for the eye. Humdrum yet beautiful.Unfortunately though I didn't find the story to be very original. A predictable plot without any surprises whatsoever, corny dialogue that made me cringe at times, and a protagonist that I just didn't like made for a not very enjoyable viewing experience. I'm not a fan of dysfunctional family settings used only as a plot device – I'd have wished for more in-depth portrayal of the parents. Moreover, although I understand why Barry's abusive family is introduced, I wish they had cut it out. In its briefness it becomes almost comical. And then – the biggest bully joins the band. Really? Come ooooon. A character that really annoyed me, besides the protagonist, was the boy with copper hair and braces. Ugh. I wanted to turn down the volume whenever he had some lines. For me, not sympathizing with the main characters of a movie is always problematic. In this case, I couldn't feel with nor root for the major characters (the band) at all, and that's the movie's major fail. Also, I'm just not a fan of teenage love portrayals, and that's perhaps my main issue.I had hoped for a good soundtrack, at least, but did not overly enjoy the chosen songs either. All in all, the movie was rather a let-down. It didn't accomplish what the premise suggested – to lift me up and make me dream."
" Amazing movie, a must watch
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,10,"Perfect blend of humour, music, and drama. Each character was cast so well and there is never a dull moment. Music will get stuck in your head for weeks. Even as bold to say that I liked it more then La La Land. Motivates you to pursue your own dreams. It is also on Netflix which is great."
" ""Yous Synge""!
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Mesmerizing. I had never heard the name of this movie. All thanks to a YouTube channel which introduced me to this fresh and feel-good narrative. The first half establishes the characters in a subtle manner, properly defining their characteristics and giving a brief overview of their families, with the lead actors Cosmo and Raphina in highlight. The second half feels a little stretched, but it more than compensates for it in the climax. What stood out for me in the movie was its music. It is fantastic. Every song has been performed exceptionally well both visually and vocally. I now have an album to listen on repeat for the coming few weeks. Do not miss this one!"
" Best of 2016 for Sure!
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,10,"I had an absolute blast watching this movie. It seems that the 80s are making a comeback with force. You have the super nostalgia that is Stranger Things and the great call backs we had with Rogue One. But this brings back the timeless sounds of the 80s. The songs and bands that inspired the originals of the movie are amazing classics. I could not get enough of the original songs throughout the movie. I immediately went and purchased almost all of them from iTunes. And I still can't get them out of my head. Way too fun and catchy.I really loved how the story progressed and the characters kind of molded to what they believed was ""cool"". But they each made a look and fit for themselves and it all worked. The music, the outfits, the hair; perfect! I never even grew up in the 80s and I love the great time piece that Sing Street is. But not only that, it was a very well put together coming-of-age story line. Conor had to find a place to fit in and grow up to love the world around him even through his family circumstances. This will be one of my favorites for a very very long time.Go buy the songs NOW!!!"
" Basic plot but quite entertaining
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,7,"Dublin, 1985. 15-year old Conor has just moved to a new school and, between the inane rules, fascist teacher-priests and bullies, it is a daunting place. He meets a beautiful girl, Raphina, and is immediately smitten by her. To get to see her he says he is in a band and they need a model for a music video, and would she be interested? She agrees. Only problem - he doesn't have a band. He hastily forms one and the creativity starts to flow...Pretty basic plot. The whole set up with Conor and Raphina is quite contrived. There is no background, limited scene setting and them meeting even seems like a non-event it is so low-key. This is not helped by the fact that she looks (and in real life, is) about 5 years older than him, rather than the one year mentioned in the movie. Made the whole romance seem implausible from the start.The plot develops in a similar vein, with a few contrivances and implausibilities along the way. Ultimately it is fairly trite and predictable.However, while lacking in substance, the movie is still very entertaining. While predictable, the plot is quite fun and there are some good comedic moments. The music is good, giving the movie great momentum, and the characters are reasonably engaging.Add to this some solid performances and, though not brilliant, Sing Street is still pretty good and never dull."
" No plot, no content
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,1,"I was looking forward to the movie after having seen ""Once"" and having liked it. That movie had good ambiance, well-made and well-placed music and likable characters. Also, this movie had great reviews here so thought it would be along the same lines of quality. Well, it wasn't. Seriously, this movie was a complete waste of time. The movie just recycles common teen movie clichés - but worse than what has been done before. The music is not good enough to carry the movie, really. And the movie is not really documenting great times or developments in history. The main character is just annoying and all characters underdeveloped. I really don't understand why the movie is made in the first place. I definitely do not recommend and I do not understand why it is getting such good reviews."
" Excellent lovely film
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,10,"John Carney is a masterful director, he did one great movie called Once, then he follow it with the mediocre Begin Again, and now he makes a come back with Sing Street, a tender, lovely, and well directed picture about a 15-year old who wants to impress a girl forming a band, and in the process he discovers friendship, love and what he wants to do with his life. The music it's just great, with Carney himself writing the lyrics and Ferdia Walsh-Peelo doing the vocals and the instrumental part of the songs, the soundtrack really becomes part of the story and actually makes sense in the context. Unlike films like La la land, Sing street is a realistic musical film that blends reality with fiction, and everything feels believable. I cannot recommend this picture enough, is funny, insightful, full of wisdom and with an optimism that inspire us to follow our dreams without feeling corny. Im giving this movie a 10 out of 10."
" Beautifully Made
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,9,"Sing Street is art-house, indie fair put into a digestible format for even the most casual movie fan. Sing Street revolves around Conor Lalor (Walsh-Pelo), a 14 year old boy being forced to change schools during his family's financial and personal struggles. The plot of the film kicks off as Conor is leaving his new school and becomes fascinated by Raphina (Lucy Boynton,) a girl who sits across the street from his new school and smokes everyday. After Raphina mentions she's a model, Conor (without actually being in a band) asks her to be in his band's music video in order to impress her. Conor then goes on a hunt for musically inclined kids in his school to start a band.Sing Street on the surface is a fairly simple premise about the lengths a boy will go to impress a girl. Where Sing Street excels is in it's execution of its sub-plots, subtle themes, and charismatic performances by its three leads. Jack Reynor as Conor's older brother Brendan is the stand out of the film, as his combination of charisma and chemistry with Walsh-Pelo made every scene they shared together a highlight of the 106 minute run time. In general the chemistry between Raphina and Conor, and Brendan and Conor is the films strongest asset and makes what could have been a simple coming of age story into one of the strongest films of 2016.John Carney deserves credit for balancing comedy, family drama, coming of age, a love story, and the music brilliantly. Sing Street is an under-watched indie darling with strong performances, acceptable pacing, and strong sub-plots about finding yourself, chasing dreams, and family relationships. My only complaint is at times the thick Irish accents throughout the film made it hard to hear some dialogue. Sing Street has far more mass appeal than most indie's and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys strong dramas.Final Grade: A-"
" Drive it along Sing street
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,9,"I thought that 2016 was dominated musically by ""La La Land"", but then I saw ""Sing street""...Well, what can I say - music is everything sometimes. And just sometimes - movie making through music is what it takes to make everyone feel so much better. Topics like family, growing up, friendship and love fill this movie with the necessary energy to carry you from beginning to end with joy and passion. I am truly inspired how the main characters start from the desire to be noticed and reach some of the highest peaks of originality in art. The 80's background music, set and costumes are far too attractive to be missed. And for me - these are all hallmarks of great directorship and cinematography. The desire to associate with, to give, to win, translates to the viewer the impression of youth's vigor and love towards pushing down walls and changing habits. The young cast of this film reminds us to never let the important things run out of our lives, no matter how hard the situation is. And always to share every spark of creativity. The unique cultural-historical perspective of this movie shows again how music connects past and future, now and then.Across cultures and distances we are interconnected by art, and in particular by good music. We can experience the passion to express ourselves all the way along our path of growing up and chasing our dreams. And to see once again how we must never lose grasp of our goals, no matter how hard it gets along the way.This movie is an excellent example of how the family can influence any young kid in both a good and a bad way. Also - the importance of a good advice against the malice of poverty and ignorance is really obvious. ""Sing Street""is the newest story of how love can actually save and dignify. But more than everything we see - how music can be a solution to all. And without any guaranteed success at the end, we enjoy this film as a really splendid creation of nostalgia, music and love.I truly recommend this small treasure to you and your close ones. We can never have too much music and love in our lives!"

Falling in love with a girl and the love triangle. Creating own band and achieving accomplishment. Adventure and pursuit of ideals. Struggle with life and disappointment. Thoughts and dreams and the way how they come about in reality. A variety of musical styles which receive tributes so originally. Ultimately, true love and pursuit of happiness.

" Starts promisingly, ends in cliché
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,5,"""Sing Street"" is this year's entry in the UK/Ireland coming-of-age movie genre. These movies are generally a treat. You get some reality from these movies that you don't generally get from coming- of-age films from the US. When a movie hits some real notes you watch closely, thinking that it might be about to break free from the reins of cliché and show you something different. You generally also get poignancy in the bargain: truth hits home.""Sing Street"" starts like that, and it starts well. Connor is a fifteen year old high school kid who has to change schools due to financial difficulty his constantly warring parents are experiencing. The school is a nightmare, filled with bullies, delinquents, and teachers as violent as both.Connor has a plan, though: he wants to start a band. He does this with an ease that feels a bit contrived. In fact, everything that happens with the band seems too easy: all the members can play adequately from the get go, despite only being in their middle teens, and they come together much quicker than seems likely. When Connor sings, the voice doesn't sound like it comes from his body, or even from the environment the character is in. It sounds like it comes from a recording studio, and a man much older with more training, and maybe even some studio effects to balance it out.If Connor can sing this well, why is he looking to start a band with a bunch of school friends? Shouldn't he be on ""Top of the Pops""?""Sing Street"" is a movie that starts like a breath of fresh air, a movie that could end up containing truth. Alas, it doesn't; it heads into cliché territory and never really looks back.The movie features a dream sequence in which everyone sings and dances and priests do cartwheels. While watching this, I wasn't sure if what I was watching was supposed to be fantasy or just more of the same. That's the problem with the whole movie."
" A Fun Film With A Heart...And, Some Good Music
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,7,"Being 57 years of age I'm hardly the target market of this film. But hey, since when does art have to be polarizing? It just needs to be good and have something one can connect to. Sing Street connects with the human spirit inhabiting us all.Sing Street is about being young and dreaming out beyond what you know. That's pretty universal. Conor has a need to break out of his existence, not reckless rebellion, just to follow his muse which he decides will be music. Turns out he has some talent and is surrounded by some supporting friends who believe in him too. It provides a kind of release he's looking for because he's in a kind of depressing lot within the break-up of his parents and the stifling school and town he lives in. Of course there's a girl because why would you want to be in a band if not for that reason? The phrase ""youth springs eternal"" comes to mind and history has proved it to be a powerful catalyst for creativity and change and so it goes here.This is a fine little movie. It is well done though certainly light. It's a bit fantastical to be sure and if one is going to dream isn't it best to take that path? Besides the fine production values for a modest film there's some seriously decent 80's music reflecting much of the times as well as, surprisingly, great original music made for the film. This is a fun and uplifting film for all. It might help to love music though it's certainly not required. Writer/director John Carney obviously birthed this one from the heart and it shows as there's hardly a false step. It's kind of like an indie version of ""That Thing You Do"" with a heart first and foremost. I hope this Dublin based production finds a larger audience as it certainly has merit and deserves to be seen. As of early 2017 it's available on several streaming sights so there's hope. Young Ferdia Walsh- Peelo as protagonist Conor deserves special praise as he's immediately likable and pulls the viewer in to story. Simply fun to watch which is a refreshing change from so many dark films of late."
" wonderful, heartwarming, and hilarious
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"Despite ""La La Land""'s dazzling visual beauty and charming story, ""Sing Street"" is without a doubt the best music related film of the year. It is a story filled with heart, truth, and humor-a beautiful, entertaining little film for everyone. On paper, this movie was practically destined to be forgettable, but somehow the plot's clichés are executed and scripted in such a way that the final project is as unique as it is likable. This is an inspiring movie, a movie that will make you smile, but also might make you cry. Despite being one of the most joyous, heartwarming films of the year, there is plenty of hard hitting emotional conflict. Essentially, this movie features almost all of the key elements needed to make a great film: likable characters, great performances, witty humor, genuine dramatic tension, good chemistry between love interests, great music, outstanding cinematography, charming story line/script, godly entertainment value, etc. If you just want to see a movie that will blow you away, watch ""Sing Street"", a lovely comedy-drama destined to be a classic in the future!"
" Gets worse the more you think about it
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,6,"I want to explain my rating system. I usually consider a 9 an A 8 a B, etc BUT adjust base off how overrated a movie is. I initially gave this a 9 but had to change it seeing the ridiculous praise.Again, I stress it's perfectly good and you should see it BUT Sing Street is really overrated. It's one of those I enjoyed but you realize flaws in retrospect.The movie is a thematic mess. It's about ""living the dream"" (and is really one the nose with it) but fails to explore it (especially since La La Land did it way better). Instead of being about him doing the band because he enjoys it, he does it entirely for Raphina completely undercutting its main theme. He is set up as a music prodigy but his brother and friend end up knowing way more and are more deserving of living the dream. Then, he intentionally stops trying in school, fails and is okay with it. This is such an insult to real musicians who go to school to learn the nature of music OR at least have SOME talent!!Possible spoiler: Then the end is even more ridiculous. He runs away with Raphina to England. It works as feel good but makes no sense: how will he pay? where will he stay? how does he plan on getting accepted anywhere with no talent? what happens when he and Raphina go through a high school break up like EVERY other high school? what will he tell his parents?This movie is a ridiculous, overrated movie that is perfectly okay.﻿"

",2017-01-19 00:00:00,7,"After BEGIN AGAIN (2013), his Manhattan sortie with Hollywood named stars, Irish music aficionado John Carney's latest flick regresses to his native territory in the spirit of ONCE (2006), SING STREET casts a cohort of teenagers against the retro milieu of Dublin in the mid-80s, friskily encapsulates the music ambiance of that epoch (featuring hits from THE CURE, A-HA, DURAN DURAN, SPANDAU BALLET, THE CLASH etc.), which potently lures those who are in his age group into the realm of nostalgia and reminiscence; on the other hand, its central coming-of-age-and- puppy-love plot and high-school band rebellion can vicariously connect with younger viewers, up till Post-Millennials. That is a win-win stratagem. SING STREET, is the name of the teen band found by the high-schooler Conor Lalor (Walsh-Peelo), a 15-year-old boy who has just been transferred to a free Christian Brothers state-school on the Synge Street due to his family's economic restraint, a microcosm of the doldrums smothering the whole country at then. At home, his parents Robert (Gillen) and Penny (Kennedy) constantly rattle each other's cages, and his hemp-incensed big brother Brendan (Reynor, who tends to chew the scenery whenever sharing the same frame with his greener co-star) presciently tells him their marriage is hanging by a thread. At school, Conor is picked on by bully Barry (Kenny) and clashes with Brother Baxtor (Wycherley), the atrocious school principal. The reality sucks, (at one time, one character virtually calls Dublin a shithole), the only vent for Conor is music until he meets his muse Raphina (Boynton, a bliss for a not-so-likable character), an attractive model-to-be who is one year older than him, but thanks to the obsolete makeup and get-up of that period, hardly she and Conor seem to belong to the same age bracket prima facie. Jumping on the bandwagon of all-the- rage music videos, Conor takes the initiative to form a band, recruited Eamon (Kenna), a multi- instrumentalist (who definitely needs a movie of his own) among others, so as to ask Raphina to star in their videos. Raphina is intrigued for the invitation, but like many an Irish folk at that time, London is the holy land for her, not here in Dublin, the video-shooting is just some pastime before her impending departure (with her adult boyfriend who promises her a bright future in London), and Conor knows it very well, he is prepared for the disappointment but love is love, especially the very first crush, how can a boy resist that beautiful feeling? The film's forte, indeed, derives from Carney's unsentimental angle of inducing a piquant benevolence and sincerity when deciphering the pre-adolescent vagaries of moods in the sometimes harsh, sometimes unpleasant, sometimes delightful reality, and his refusal of padding out the garden-variety narrative with hokum dialogues and feel-good bells-and-whistles (as used in most similar themed pictures). Everything goes pretty much as we expect (bar the impulsive ending), but there is also a can-do vibe pulsating along with the story's frolicking teen spirits, where ingenuousness and defiance are melded together to leaven the film to be more relatable (also ascribed to the deft job from cosmetics section). Bloating ego, showbiz swagger, internal conflicts, demerits would imaginably stem from the scenario have no access to taint the kids' revelry, although, in my case, the band's largely original punk-pop tunes are too nondescript for my tone-deaf ears. Finally, its semi-fantasy, semi-reality coda, speaks volumes of Carney's tendresse towards his young protagonists - dare to love, dare to dream and dare to fight for one's dream, which rounds off this retro-inspiring crowd-pleaser with a substantial leap of artistic licence - a beacon of prowess in filmmaking."
" Oscar-worthy
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,9,"Wonderful narrative, cinematography, and plot. Stunning visuals. A masterpiece. According to Limonoso Tech, these are the IMDb phrases that presage an Oscar nomination, and this film is worthy. 2016 is the year that John Carney surpassed Terrence Malick as our greatest living director. Carney is one of the few remaining auteurs; what can he do next? This film represents the future, a la '85, and Lucy Boynton is the next Keira Knightley. Every music video is perfect and the songs are wonderful. I like how the hero deals with a bully, saying: ""You're just material for my songs."" The ending is satisfying a la ""The Graduate."" What better reason for form a band than to impress a girl?"
" A feel-good moment for Ireland (and for us all)
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"Don't you hate those oversweetened soppy good stories that literally reek of fake? As if the movie creators thought they could really make us buy into all that positive sh!te they just made up without even trying to ground it into something realistic! Well, I certainly do. And it's my pleasure to announce that Sing Street had no single hint of that fake happiness, which makes it a rather unique case of a feel-good film that genuinely feels that way.The story here is simple as hell and revolves around the things all the adolescents dream about: feeling love, finding your true self, breaking free of the confines of the house rules and societal prejudice. But how come Sing Street still feels like a breath of fresh sea breeze in the morning? From a rational standpoint, it's a mystery.Mr Freud, whose face we could glimpse on several occasions in the film itself, might have an answer though. Feel-good movies don't feel too good because they are about people we (okay, most of us) actually failed to become. Failed to find that true love, or pursue our true destiny, failed to become what we've been dreaming to become. And seeing an artificially crafted cinema figure reach for its stars is less motivating as it's depressing.But this time we don't have to choose between a starry path charted for and by someone else and our own less stellar reality. This time we've gotten our alter ego right there. A stoner, a school dropout, formally a typical loser... but who still gets some love from the movie, and for whom someone else's pursuit of a dream is not a source of jealousy but rather a moment of redemption and liberation, however small or past due. And for those who are already too expired to put their hopes into following Conor's path, Brendan is an alternative still positive enough to make us all smile, and this time actually feeling that it's a sincere smile.My only complaint about this film is that, by making all the main characters so dashing and daring, it made them way too unrealistic. Ireland might be a birthplace for a lot of famous musicians, but passing the lyrics written by six(!) grown-up men for a 15 year-old's work is just way over the top. Being so fiercely brave and witty, both with enemies and love interests, and looking so shamelessly dazzling is what every kid has wet dreams of, but nobody ever had for real. So if the Sing Street members had been just several years older, it would've been much more natural. But, then again, the movie wouldn't have had that break-away vibe it bases itself on...But these are the things we sacrifice for the greater good. And, at the end of the day, Sing Street is good because it made us believe in something for a moment. That no matter if you live your life in Ireland or in some other depressing sh!thole, no matter if you took an arrow in the knee or if the world's trying to screw you over right now, the steering wheel to your future is still in your hands. So ride it like you stole it! PS: the kids playing the band members are just unreal! I can't believe almost all of them don't even have an IMDb profile pic. And Mark McKenna who played Eamon... Dude, you're like Shia LaBeouf all over again, but without that Transformers stain he still can't wash off. Keep going like you do and you're golden!"
" Sing Street is a delightful film that is almost impossible to watch without a smile on your face and tapping of your feet for its outstanding soundtrack.
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"Sing Street (2016): Films about people at school forming bands are well known for being 60% more lovable than any other sort, and this movie is no exception.Sing Street,directed by Irish Film maker John Carney,has already been nominated for 74th Golden Globe Awards but sadly it will lose it to La La Land.If not for La La Land,Sing Street has all the necessary emotions and qualities to win a best musical movie of 2016.Why am I boasting it up before the review?You will see..Plot:SING STREET takes us back to 1980s Dublin seen through the eyes of a 14-year-old boy named Conor (Ferdia Walsh-Peelo) who is looking for a break from a home strained by his parents' relationship and money troubles, while trying to adjust to his new inner-city public school where the kids are rough and the teachers are rougher. He finds a glimmer of hope in the mysterious, über-cool and beautiful Raphina (Lucy Boynton), and with the aim of winning her heart he invites her to star in his band's music videos. There's only one problem: he's not part of a band...yet. She agrees, and now Conor must deliver what he's promised and immersing himself in the vibrant rock music trends of the decade, he forms a band with a few lads, and the group pours their heart into writing lyrics and shooting videos.In a sea of opportunities ahead of them, what does the future hold for a love like this?Plus Points:1)Music: Sing Street is brilliant mostly because of its music.Much of the original music by the band ""Sing Street"" was composed by 80s veteran composer Gary Clark,which really gives us some nostalgic 80's rocking music with meaningful lyrics.For every 5 minutes a song always plays and it played a brilliant part in the movie.""The Riddle of the Model"" is one of the best track from this movie.I loved the other tracks too.2)Performances: Newcomer Ferdia Walsh-Peelo is outstanding in his role and he surely has a bright future ahead.He surely is a Futurist:)When Conor gives an early Sing Street song called The Riddle of the Model to Raphina, he assures her: ""It's not about you. It's about another model I know."" Walsh-Peelo delivers the line with just the right mixture of shyness and teenage petulance.The other one I liked in this movie is Mark McKenna who played the role Eamon who has talent to play any kind of instrument.Lucy Boynton is lovely.Especially during the shoot of The Riddle of the Model,her expressions are marvelous.Jack Reynor as Brendon is very good in his role.3)Screenplay and Direction: Sing Street has the most familiar plot for a musical drama but John Carney successfully made such a beautiful engaging drama with a perfect script.Sing Street is, in fact, a delightful coming-of-age tale that both celebrates young love and laments how quickly the fire of youth can be snuffed out. Director John Carney knows exactly how to mesh storytelling and music into his films.He is the next best after Damien Chazelle in directing a perfect musical picture.A great applause for Carney.So,Sing Street is a delightful film that is almost impossible to watch without a smile on your face and tapping of your feet for its outstanding soundtrack.One of the best musicals in recent times.My rating 8/10"
" Just superb.
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,10,"Had heard so many good things about this and had really wanted to see it but it didn't come to my local world of cine so I missed out during its theatrical run and one thing or another had made me not catch up later, but I was determined to see it before the year was out as I thought it might be one of my favourite films, and I was right. I had really enjoyed Begin Again and Once was one of my favourite films when I saw it so I am a fan of director Carney's work and in this he's right back up to Once's standards. I was enjoying it from the start, helped by the 1980's setting which was when I was in senior school just like the protagonists and which the film perfectly portrays, but was not blown away. But as it progressed it just crept into my being, filling me up with its energy, heart, sole and most of all its music and the joy and exuberance of its creators. The young cast here shine, from our hero, to his bully nemesis, taking in along the way the heroes dream girl, his band of misfits, and the worlds ultimate big brother. Sure, for a group of school kids they are unrealistically good at writing and performing their various pastiches of several 80's pop styles, but the songs are incredibly catchy and the homemade videos they create for them are very funny and perfectly of the era. If you don't leave this film with a song in your heart and a smile on your face, then your dead inside."
" The third installment of John Carney's musical films
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"So apparently Sing Street is made by the people behind ""Begin again"" and ""Once"", two films that I have thoroughly enjoyed. A running theme throughout all three seems to be its theme of depicting musicians and their 'life of struggles'. All three are small budget but packs very meaningful stories completed with beautiful scores and wonderfully performed musical pieces.Sing street depicts a story of how music and creating music is a cure to the struggles of everyday life. The idea of Irish teens moving to London and the mainland to follow a certain ideal or dream is very much reflected in the story itself. Depicting the risk taking attitude of youth. At the same time featuring the excitement of the creative process and developing a creative idea into a physical medium.I am most impressed with the performance delivered by Jack Reynor, previously know for ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" where he did not have such a major role. His depiction of a washed up high school dropout is masterfully portrayed and his character acted as such a brilliant mirror to our main character, 'the failed predecessor'. To learn this character's back story through a burst of emotions from him really made the character possess so much more depth and it is all thanks to Jack Reynor's brilliant portrayal.This film was really great, continuing the trilogy of films that followed this sort of formula yet being unique in their own ways."
" Funny, sweet, joyful movie with a lot of heart
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,9,"'Sing Street' is set in Dublin during the 80's, when teenager Conor, subliminally portrayed by Ferdia Walsh-Peelo, is forced to change schools due to the incapability of his parents to make ends meet. Across the street from his new school, where the protagonist is challenged by the new environment from the first day on, Conor notices a mysterious girl (an outstanding Lucy Boynton). Eager to impress this mysterious girl, he makes up that he plays in a band. So Conor kinda has to start a band now.'Sing Street' is another music movie written and directed by John Carney, who has had past successes with 'Begin Again' and foremost 'Once'. This time Carney revisits his childhood and it pay off big time. It's a sweet, joyful movie about so much more than impressing the girl. First of all, the music is great. With the help of his brother Brendan, played by Jack Reynor with a knock-out performance, Conor tries to find his identity as an artist and moves like a loose cannon from one source of inspiration to another. From Duran Duran, to David Bowie, to the Cure. The songs he composes together with his band, an ensemble of misfits, is catchy, fun, very eighties, with lyrics that shape his character and serve the plot. While the musical aspect of the movie makes the movie lots of fun, there are various powerful scenes that make 'Sing Street' one of the best movies of 2016. One scene where Brendan talks to Conor about their mother, enjoying the last rays of sun of the day seems like a small, simple scene but is so very powerful and plain devastating. It are those moments of great dialogue and symbolism (and not coincidentally most of the time with Jack Reynor in them) that make this movie grow on you even days or weeks after watching it. This coming of age movie also has the typical romantic story line. The dork trying to get the hot girl is a concept used in many, maybe too many movies and has become a cliché. Here, you just don't care about the cliché because the story line is handled in such a sweet and tender way that you simply want all the clichés to play out as you expect them to, because you want to see them played out in this exact way. Walsh-Peelo and Boynton have an amazing chemistry, with great dialogue, sometimes with a philosophical character. He's only 14 years old, she's 17, but being 'happy sad' puts the oldest among us to think. The dialogue wasn't only strong between these two characters. Over the entire movie, so much is said with subtle choice of words. Nobody ever explicitly states how they feel or what happened in their lives. instead of plainly pointing out how a character feels, the dialogue guides our perception about the feelings and background of a character. This is the dialogue in its purest form. This subtle guiding of our perception is also achieved by the amazing performances of the actors. Music, trying to find your identity as a person and artist, and love are three main recurring themes through the movie. But the movie reaches another zenith when you realize it's about more than all of that. It's about the relationship between two brothers in a broken family. The relationship between Conor and Brendan is perhaps the best part of the movie, again because of strong performances by both actors, and again because of the way it was handled by John Carney. Brendan's character will be relatable for every first born of the family.Sing Street is a must see, extremely joyful, sweet and funny movie. Besides the fun, the movie hides many layers that will make the movie stick with you for a long time. Hopefully, this movie will receive the appreciation it deserves during the upcoming award season."
