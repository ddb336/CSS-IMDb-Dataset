" I understand why most wouldn't like this film... but...
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,8,"It's easy to slate the film, especially if you're one to primarily focus on mob, gangster, shooters, action, fast paced genres.Bryan Cranston is not Walter white in this story, not too far from it, but still not, nonetheless.Cinematography and individual performances are the thing to look out for in this one. Bryan is fantastic, as usual, and if you can look past that the majority of the movie is set in one room, you might get to understand the dynamic of his performance.On that note, the dialogue is almost akin to Shakespeare, incredibly poetic, mysterious, but not misguiding.To end on, I again understand why those who watched this disliked the ending, but I believe it to be the opposite. There is no doubt you were not wondering what you would've done in that situation. I believe it made you, decide what was to unfold. Similarity in pulp fiction with the briefcase, you never know what's in it, but, Tarantino did once say, it was what ever you wanted it to be."
" please dont watch this!
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,1,What a waste of time...I dont even know what to say....trash.
" Absolutely BRILLIANT!
",2021-01-28 00:00:00,10,Anyone who has been married has felt this!! At least I have!! Happily SINGLE 20 years now!!
" Its my kind of contemplating.
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,9,"You can talk about how misleading the narrator is, how slow paced it is, but for me it creates a meditative character study, that actually relishes how sincerely flawed our protagonist is."
" Bryan Cranston puts in a good performance in this study of family relaionships
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,6,"A successful New York attorney (Bryan Cranston) lives in a nice suburban home, has been married to his wife (Jennifer Garner) for 15 years and has teenage twin daughters. He thinks about the ups and downs of their relationship, loses his job and walks out on his family. Except he is not far as he is hiding in a small room above the garage spying on his family for months from a window in the garage, watching their different stages of grief.Cranston practically carries this film alone on this parable on human relationships and family. Not short of humour, it is both an interesting and sad study that sometimes stretches credibility."
" The ending happened with 28 minutes left in the movie
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,7,"All of you griping about being cheated out of an ending are missing the entire point of the movie. This movie was meant to make you think and evaluate your own life. The true ending of the movie came with 28 minutes left to go in the film, where Howard has the following epiphany:""If anything, I've come into my senses fully.
My god, I can see it so clearly.
I've constructed the whole thing.
The jealousy ...
... the resentment ...
...the selfish urgency.
Howard is victim.
Howard is persecutor.
Howard has mastered the world.
That was my prison. That's what I've escaped.
Leaving me where now?
An outcast of cosmos.
I'll tell you this.
You can think whatever you like.
I love my wife now as I've never loved her before...""To me THIS was the ending and the meaning of this movie. What happens after this awakening is irrelevant-the purpose of the film fulfilled. I for one was touched deeply by the message that can only be internalized by investing 2 hours of your time and experiencing it together with Howard Wakefield, watching him realize the shallowness of his approach to life up to that point. That was the moment it all became clear...what he threw away one day because of his own selfish ego...we too can escape our own prison of self-ego-mania by letting go of what Howard did the hard way, look at our life under a new tint, and embrace what's good right now.An amazing performance by Cranston."
" Lost in thought..
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,3,"A jumbled mismatch of twisted emotions and a pointless climax.
A sad waste of talent and possibly a waste of 120 minutes of your life too.."
" TRASH
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,1,Don't watch this piece of trash film. I want to strangle the director and the writer. Eat it u jerks. A piece of garbage that you should avoid at all costs!!!!
" Check your attic
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,5,"Some thoughts from watching Wakefield:
* This is one of the oddest house designs in history, staring down from an upstairs attic/garage into your living room.
*How the hell did this man ever end up with Jennifer Garner?
*That is one of the best stocked pantries I've ever seen.
* The section with the 'Special' kids next door was rather moving and needed exploring more.
* The commentary from Wakefield is too one level and just a little dull
* The cinematography around the lake was beautiful
* I just had no empathy for this man and that made it difficult to care about his plight.A very unusual movie but not without some merit."
" Bad & Pointless. That Pretty Much Says It All!
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,1,"My wife and I discuss our ratings and are usually close in our opinions. She surprised me with a ""1"" this time. She said it was a pointless and boring movie so naturally I asked why she didn't ask me to stop and delete it. Her answer was she wanted to see how it ended. Well, let me tell you that neither of us appreciated the abrupt ending. We just looked at it other with a ""what?"" That sealed the rating of ""1"" and I agree. Our advice is not to waste your time. You will be happier if you scrub the mildew off that board in the yard you're throwing away. Does this review contain spoilers? Only if you think a movie should entertain and have at least a decent ending. I'm thinking the director, producer, actors and support people were running late for the city bus back to the real world so they shut it down early and said ""What the heck, people Will think it's artistic."" Nah, we didn't."
" Howard Wakefield: Self-Absorbed, Spineless and Hateful
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,4,"So: The guy decides to give up on his family and friends because he would rather be a voyeur who is also a garbage connoisseur. He would rather sleep alone in an attic than sleep with his hottie wife. He doesn't even have the balls to OWN his own weird philosophy.
I was hoping for a suicide..."
" Only watch for Cranston
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,7,"This movie could have been much better, I gave it a 7 just because of Brian, would have been a 4 otherwise."
" One of the second worst movie..
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,1,"How could such two great actors decide to play in this boring,stupid, dull,lack luster, idiotic film. I also question the viewers given this film a 6 something rating, it truly is sad that people today know nothing about an actual good movie I gave up  long ago.."
" Just another artsy movie with a lazy ending
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,1,It seems like more and more of the newer movies have no ending at all. They just end in the air like the writers got bored or lacked the competence to write a decent ending. This movie is another one of those. They seem to be a dime a dozen these days.
" Worthy of being seen
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,9,"An original nice film, with an excellent texture and actors, moreover the message that it wants to communicate it's profound.
I've enjoyed to watch it. Congratulations"
" Don't waste your time
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,1,"It's really boring, i am suprised how could Bryan Cranston accepted to play in this Movie. Even he couldn't rescue the Film, pointless, really very Bad."
" Its Walter White!!!
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,9,"Love Bryan Cranston So I love this movie Always feel a character when Bryan plays him and this is no exception, I can identify with many of his views and little ticks...Ive rated it 9 for this reason!."
" Great Acting but Horrible Storyline
",2019-09-05 00:00:00,5,"Seems interesting enough plot at first that the man has a nervous break down decides to live up in his attic watching the life of his wife and two children from their very open windows from the back of the house. He can be seen by no one even though if a person goes missing it seems to me that you would check all places of the household including out structures and make sure he didn't kill himself but in any event he manages to live up in the attic over several months into the winter and watches his wife getting on with her life down below although she really doesn't get on with her life she's actually a devoted, faithful wife who loves him and doesn't have any other extramarital relations even though he continues to replay in his head the jealous, non trusting relationship that he had with her. I really did not like this character - he was completely self absorbed and only decides to come back into the picture when he sees that she has struck a friendship up again with the gentleman that he competed with for her affections in the first place. I feel sorry for her entering into a committed marriage with this pitiful manipulator."
" Weird to say the least
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,6,The whole time you are wondering what is this guy doing and at the end you never realize what you just watched.
" Surprisingly good.
",2019-08-20 00:00:00,8,"This movie starts out a little weird and confusing, but once you get into it, the story is extremely interesting and intriguing. The story is so absurd, that even though it's a little tragic, it has some funniness to it. It's also very unpredictable, so you want to keep watching to know what will happen. Lastly, Bryan Cranston's acting in this movie is amazing. I would definitely recommend watching this if you're up for a freakish drama film."
" 25 Minutes Was Enough
",2019-07-06 00:00:00,1,"An absolutely ridiculous premise and something that could never happen. I could anticipate where this was heading after only wasting 25 minutes. I think the rating for this is greatly skewed by Cranston fans. If it were some nobody, it probably wouldn't clear 3 stars."
" the most boring movie of 2016
",2019-05-31 00:00:00,2,"And the worst ending of any movie I've seen since the Crying Game. This is a boring movie about a man who gets bored with his life and moves into his garage to watch his family move on with him ""dead"" and that is it ... for 90 minutes. Just do yourself a big favor and skip this one"
" Dont waste your time...
",2019-05-13 00:00:00,1,The movie is a waste of time really should not even get more than 1. And the ending SUCKS!!!
" Psyche of an A-Hole
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,7,"(Flash Review)This man, while over-analyzing his life, does a very elaborate and demented thing, he fakes his own disappearance. A man who has two twin high school girls and married out of his league....or so he believes. This last point claws at his inner self. One day on his way home from his normal job and normal life (upper middle class) he doesn't come home and doesn't answer his phone when his wife calls. He hides upstairs in the loft over his garage and watches his family through the window for a night and then two. When will he come down? What will his family do? Will he resolve his inner turmoil? This was a weird movie. As a character study, it poetically went through his emotional state and why he made this decision. While nicely told and acted by Cranston, it became a little redundant and could have used more dashes of drama. An odd and somber story with an ending that one can argue cheats the viewer."
" Strange but kinda spot on
",2019-05-07 00:00:00,8,This was a very strange film especially to find Cranston in but yet again I can think of anyone better suited. Worth the watch for Cranston alone
" The other reviews here are a joke....
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,8,"Every review I'm seeing for the low score is obsessed with the ending, calling it ""horrible"" and ""lazy"". They're missing the point of the entire film and shouldn't even have bothered watching. It's left open ended not out of laziness, but as an artistic choice. The point is, it's not about how his family reacted. The whole movie was about the deconstruction of Cranston's psyche. That's why the appropriate ending was about his EXPECTATIONS of their reactions. It ended with the scenarios playing out in his head, as a lot of the film featured. People who want an ending that tells you everything should see lesser movies then. It doesn't belong here. They're missing the point.Other than the subject of the ending, which I had to point out, the film is very good. Bryan Cranston is excellent throughout, giving a vey lived-in performance that manages to feel fresh throughout. He is excellent at playing the anti-hero, the protagonist who isn't necessarily a good guy. Jennifer Garner is also very good, albeit in smaller doses. She does pull of the believability of being younger in the flashbacks though, something no amount of small budget makeup can do for Cranston. The special needs kids next door plot thread feels like the only failing of the film. It handles it fine, and they don't teach him some big lesson about himself really, but it does feel contrived as filler. But otherwise, the film serves as an all around great piece on a man's existential crisis"
" Rear-Window Retreat
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,4,"""Wakefield"" is a peculiar movie in that it's about a man abandoning his family, job and routine to secretly live in the attic for months, scavenging for scraps like a derelict or raccoon (lots of visual parallels of him to raccoons in this one), while spying on his family reacting to his disappearance. On the other hand, it's a bromide of a middle-class suburbanite reacting extremely to a mid-life crisis. Another ""American Beauty""(1999), for instance. And, in another way, it's derivative of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" (1954) except, here, the man has retreated from his own life so that he may watch it without himself in it--in a sense, he exits the screen. Like ""Rear Window,"" it's a metaphor for cinematic spectatorship, and Bryan Cranston's Howard Wakefield is the surrogate for us viewers, as was James Stewart's Jefferies in ""Rear Window."" Cranston even finds a pair of binoculars, like Stewart did, to watch the scenes taking place through the window. That his point of view, or gaze, is strongly linked with that of the camera's strengthens the character identification between us and him.With this being based on a short story, though, it adds another layer of voice-over narration and flashbacks and fantasies from Wakefield's inner perspective. Although such techniques are common to cinema as well as to literature, their use here works to undermine the association of Wakefield as spectator of the film-within-the-film and, instead, makes him more of a traditional character to be viewed by the real audience. (This also undermines the much-criticized ending, which would've been more appropriate had he been more of a surrogate spectator and less of a traditional character.) Yet, the ultimate failing of ""Wakefield"" is that it isn't that strange. It's no more than a variation on ""The Burbs"" (1989), another Hitchcockian suburban vacation, but minus the murder mystery and, perhaps, not as funny and more pretentious."
" Liked it a lot the first time, not so much the second
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,6,"I love small movies like Wakefield. I watched it in the theater and really liked it a lot. However, I just saw it on Netflix for the second time and it did nothing for me. It's a great premise and a beautiful story. The problem is that there was WAY too much voice-over. I normally don't have a problem with narration, but this was just excessive. It gives the viewer no room to experience what's happening. I felt like this should have been the kind of movie where you can watch it multiple times and discover something new each time, but there was nothing to be gained from a second viewing. It's worth seeing, but like I said, once is enough."
" Not a good ending
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,5,Maybe Howard was having a mid life crisis. Disappointing ending.
" Don't waste your time!
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,1,"Worst ending in a movie ever. This could have been so much better, but someone forgot to write the ending, wtf."
" Many seem to be missing the message in this movie
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,8,"If you think it's about a guy who secretly lived in his garage's attic while watching his family move on through a window YOU ARE MISSING THE POINT.There is no attic and the window is his looking glass into his life. He's 50 and his self-less goal has become to provide for his family who pretty does not see him. Emotionally unavailable, the attic symbolizes the space in his mind where he has retreated as he watching his life as a spectator. People hate the ending, but he's just came back and it's won't be a big deal.I'm sure some 50 yo married guys will relate."
" Such a waste of time, even for him
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,1,"How do you root for a stupid loser?
Wait no more: you won't!"
" Pretentious Garbage With No Ending
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,1,"I love thoughtful films. I love films that aren't Hollywood style. I love films that don't have endings.However, this film has horrible pretentious writing. Awkward editing. And is just straight mediocrity the whole way through with a complete lack of ending.I am crying while writing this because I've never had a worse experience watching a film."
" Long Wait For Nothing
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,3,An hour and fifty minutes of Bryan Cranston living in his own attic. The movie just never goes anywhere and the ending is like ...What? Except for some funny moments this film is basically forgettable.
" Unsatisfying end
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,6,"The plot was bearable through 90%, but kept wanting it to be over. The ending lacked imagination."
" A different ending could have made this a really good movie!
",2019-03-19 00:00:00,4,"Loved the movie right up to the time when our main character engages with Emily & Herbert! He was learning important lessons about life, waking up from the deep sleep he'd been in for such a long time! I'm sure many of us can relate to dealing with the hum drumness of life! He was on a journey, learning about the things that are really important in life! And just as important as the journey, the ending was equally important, perhaps even more so! The ending let me down! It could have been a really good movie with a different ending!"
" Failed ending
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,7,"Here you have a man that's wondering if he's even loved by his wife and children. One evening after coming home from work, staring at his family in the garage after ignoring his wife repeated calls, decides he is not in the mood for an evening of arguments. So he decides to wait until his family is asleep to go inside his home, but falls asleep in the garage. To me this is where the crossroads begin, the nervous breakdown. He chooses to continue to live in the garage attic, at first maybe for a couple of days, which then turn into weeks then months. During this time he eats out the garbage and dumpsters of the area, steal moments to take a shower or bath from his neighbors basement or the nearby park. I never could understand why not eat from the house when his family is away than to eat out the garbage, but I guess that's to make the movie a little bit more disturbing.I feel his interaction with the children from next door showed how humbled he become, after all they would be the ones to save his life from his near death experience with the cold winter he succumbed himself to. I was glad to see the neighbor didn't have any other motives but that of wanting to help mentally challenged children.As each holiday pass that the family celebrates without him, it allows you to keep track of how many months go by. This is what keeps you drawn to the movie, the anticipation of what will happen when he inserts himself back home. How will his wife react? Will she divorce him to continue her relationship that she has rekindled with her husbands best friend? How will the twins receive him? What does he tell the police about his whereabouts? So many questions, right? Well we will never know, he gets a shower, groomed, some new clothes and walks in the door after seeing his family have a family dinner with his best friend the night before. The threat of another man was enough to send him home.
The movie wasn't a waste, it just left a huge cliff hanger at the end."
" Had such a hard time feeling ANY sympathy for Cranston's character
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,1,Soooooo selfish I just could not stomach this person! You steal your best friend's girl and then abandon her AND THEN only come back when she's back with your friend again?! Barf!I was so frustrated by the ending that I changed my rating from 5 stars to 1.
" Where's the ending???? Sat through this and no end?
",2019-03-11 00:00:00,1,Where's the ending???? Sat through alllll of this and no end? Awful movie. I want my two hours back. What did the family say?
" What should you do when you just want to disappear
",2019-03-11 00:00:00,7,"Brian Cranston's solo performance is both comical and disturbing. I loved his first person narrative throughout the film. Watching his family suffer from his disappearance. One thing is missing, he hasn't left from his own home. It was brilliant on Cranston's part, I preferred it that way. But he suffered a little from deceiving his family."
" interesting
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,7,"Not a great movie but an OK movie. It kept my interest throughout. Unfortunately there's not enough Jennifer Garner which was my main reason for watching it. The entire movie is centered on Bryan Cranston and he, an excellent actor, keeps things interesting. Sadly the movie does not have satisfactory ending. I think they really dropped the ball there."
" Horribly boring
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,1,"The only reason to sit through this movie is to root for Bryan Cranston to die, and I'm a Bryan Cranston fan. Skip this unless you have insomnia."
" Doesn't quite work
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,6,"An interesting idea that just doesn't connect like I thought it would. Cranston, as always, is brilliant. In fact, he is the only reason I kept watching this. It would probably be a 4 without him."
" A total and utter letdown.
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,2,"Spoilers: Bryan Cranston as a middle-aged lawyer who, rather than go home one night, decides to live in his garage and observe his wife for several months, becoming a bearded hermit who befriends the handicapped kids next door.Shades of 'It's A Wonderful Life', 'Bartleby', 'The Swimmer', and 'Rear Window', 'Wakefield' has a great flow for a voiced-over POV movie, sympathetically depicts the plight of the homeless, and raises questions about family, home and materialism.. The disappointing thing is the total letdown your hopes of a clincher ending, for something to happen that resolves the conflict between (Can't remember the hero's name even)'s view of himself and reality.The narrative, like 'The Swimmer' and 'Bartleby', works on different levels; is it a dream, is it a metaphor, etc. The ending doesn't work on any level whatever. Zilcho. You would enjoy this film more if there was a fire alarm in the cinema about ten minutes before the end."
" Boring, slow, and dreadful
",2018-10-24 00:00:00,3,"I love Bryan Cranston, but he's awful in this film. The entire story is flawed and poorly executed. Bryan Tries with the material given, the other actors don't have much to do, the direction is competent.It's just Mediocre. With a better story and a more interesting narrative this could've been an interesting character study. But as it is, I can't tell you a single character's name or personality type because we only spend time with Bryan Cranston and I have no idea what or who his character is supposed to be."
" The best movie ever made!!! A must see!!!
",2018-10-12 00:00:00,10,"The best movie ever made!!! A must see!!!
I you like to see a movie that is interesting and entertaining at the same time, this is the movie!!!"
" Utter disappointment
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,4,"I waited and waited for an ending that would that could possibly make his animalistic behavior admirable, but it never came.
VERY difficult to watch, I at least wanted so see the families reaction, but NOTHING!"
" He never actually left
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,8,"After watching Wakefield, I wanted to read reviews of the movies to see if anyone else felt the way I felt about it.The way I see it, Howard never really left. He simply isolated and distanced himself as he went through his normal daily routine while struggling with his fears and anxieties. Fortunately and with the help of the two very kind and truly innocent young people, Herbert and Emily, Howard finds a way out of his isolation and he decides at then end to open up to his family in the hope that they will want him back into their lives that he abandoned.I suspect that when he walks into that room in the last scene of the movie while his wife and two daughters are decorating the Christmas tree, they will all be very happy to see and to welcome the new Howard with open arms."
" E.L. Doctorow wrote this?
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,5,"E.L. Doctorow is best known as the author of ""Ragtime"", a historical fiction novel intertwining several different stories - some of them involving real people - in New York in the early 20th century. I've both read the novel and seen Milos Forman's screen adaptation.* Doctorow also wrote ""The Book of Daniel"", a fictionalized account of the Rosenberg children, which Sidney Lumet turned into a movie.So it's a surprise that Doctorow also wrote a story that was the basis for the oddball ""Wakefield"", about a man who hides from his family for several months. On the one hand, the story shows how the man reevaluates his life through this experience (how could a person living in the emptiness that is the suburbs not want to do this?). On the other hand, there's not much of a plot beyond that. Bryan Cranston turns in a fine performance, but I wish that Jennifer Garner could get a more substantial performance (although that's wishful thinking, considering what Hollywood thinks of any woman over the age of forty).OK movie, but nothing special.*Trivia: ""Ragtime"" was the film debut of Jeff Daniels, Fran Drescher, Samuel L. Jackson and Mandy Patinkin. Jackson's character therein was as much of a badass as he was ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Snakes on a Plane""."
" Well....
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,7,"Probably the worst ending for a movie that I've ever seen. Movie itself is OK, but a horrible ending"
" Extremely Relatable Character Study, Albeit Poor In Plot Development
",2018-07-12 00:00:00,5,"To appreciate this movie, or at the very least the portrait that it tries to create, you have to understand the mind of someone with OCD. If you can't relate to the main character, then you'll probably find it very empty and pointless, because the film is essentially all about exploring a world of self-imposed deprivation, and all the bells and whistles that come along with that. There's no deeper meaning; there are no overlapping plot tangents other than a briefly explored backstory as to how our main protagonist got with his wife, and fought hard to get her, competing with his friend. This serves very importantly to show the force of will, ingenuity and determination that someone like this can and often does possess despite their frailties. The rest is all about exploring the journey which leads a successful, talented and hard working person to this sort of a life of scarcity.Personally, despite the film's shortcomings, I can relate very strongly to the film because I've lived it, minus wife and kids. I believe that in fact, a lot of people have experienced these moments of personal retreat to varying degrees, and it just often doesn't get exposed for what it is. Howard Hughes would famously lock himself in his room for extended periods, and live those moments of his life consisting of the most meagre quality of sustenance, one such time when he binge watched every single Katherine Hepburn film after having become enamored with her.In my case, when my disability made it so that I could no longer work, it very similarly forced me to retreat into myself as a desperate means to cling onto my independence. I'd just sold my house, and in the course of this, bought some properties up north to maintain some rental income to help support myself. Anyone who's undergone a serious move knows that it can be one of the most stressful experiences of one's life. Coupled with being in agonizing pain all throughout, the physical ordeal made things all the worse. We still hadn't secured a new property as our main residence, and were spending a couple weeks living in a filthy smoke infested basement suite. Right at the same time my renter had moved on, so I had to go down to the city and rent out my office unit, which at this point, despite being an ordeal in and of itself, was a welcome excuse to get away from it all.Once I got to the city is where things started to unravel, you might say. After I arrived, I had several rendez-vous to make: replace the keys, set up appointments, obtain internet, acquire furniture etc. At the end of the day, in complete agony, laying on a couch in an empty office unit staring at the ceiling, you're surprised to find yourself in a state of sweet surrender that's suddenly much more appealing than you ever thought it would be. You ask yourself ""what's it going to hurt if I stay here for a few days to get my strength back?"" Days turn into weeks, and before long you've made arrangements to replace your mobile internet with a full contract including landline telephone. We'd just got our new place, and I could have returned home after a few days. A few days however, turned into 9 months.My experience was nowhere near as extreme as the one depicted in the film, of course. You can't COMPLETELY cut yourself off from the world around you while living in an office unit, and you do maintain many creature comforts: air conditioning, internet, refrigeration. Arguably you can't really cut yourself off to that extent while living in a garage attic either, so the film kind of forced the subject to an unrealistic extent. VERY unbelievable that a family, and indeed an entire neighborhood had nobody of sound mind to clock on that there was a familiar looking ""homeless dude"" living in a garage for months on end. The only ones who caught on, were some special needs kids who in turn brought the guy food and supplies without telling a soul. You'd think this would attract MORE attention more than anything else, but apparently not. While the plot integrity of the film may have been extremely lacking, it's still hard not to appreciate the portrait that it was trying to give us.It all comes back to self-imposed deprivation. Once you challenge your concept of what is and isn't normal or status quo, what may have seemed unthinkable becomes comfortable. You spend weeks living off canned fish, you pee in bottles, you give yourself sponge baths, and yes you sit around in your underwear most times to avoid stinky clothes, curtains drawn of course, as lawyers and accountants conduct business all around you. People come knocking on your door. At first you don't know how to respond, and by the time you're committed to showing yourself, the person has gone. Subsequently you become adamant about never answering your door. When the visits intensify you go out and print 10 or so signs saying ""no soliciting"" and literally ""go away!"" and plaster them all over your window. You then hear chatter ""Some guy has locked himself in his office,"" but you don't care in the slightest. Instead you sit alone peering out your window watching people come and go and musing about all the familiar souls you see, all EXACTLY as depicted in this film, and yes, you quickly learn that it's impossible for anyone to see through the cracks of drawn blinds into a dark room. It's only possible to see out because the eyes simply can't focus on the dark of a surface that's mostly light. In the end, you spend most of your days in a dark room with the lights out, and it's true, people really don't know whether anyone is home half the time.The question is, why do it? I can imagine a lot of people would find this film ridiculous because they can't imagine how ANYONE could get to this point. The answer is really quite simple. If you're someone with OCD, you want everything to be perfect. If for whatever reason you find yourself at an impasse where things CAN'T be perfect and there's nothing you can do about it, rather than settle for mediocrity, you settle for something much much less. Why? Because whatever you're settling for is something you can control, and that's what it's about. When you hear of ""hoarders,"" it's the exact same concept.At one point in my life I was a world traveler, and I fantasize about a time when I can do that again, so really this is fully different from something like agoraphobia, but even back then I can see how the same type of behaviour played out. In Asia for example, I was paranoid at the idea of taxi drivers cheating me on fares or bringing me somewhere against my will, so I insisted on walking every single place I went, 3 hour treks sometimes, hiking through the urban forest of concrete. In Auckland, I showed up at a hostel, and couldn't fathom the idea of staying in a grotty room with 6 other people, so instead I adopted a polyphasic sleep cycle and decided to stay nowhere, effectively living homeless for about 10 days. These are the things you do to maintain control. The film is about a man who feels weak, unimportant, unappreciated and desperately needs that sense of control back in his life, but doesn't know how to get it, so he retreats into himself. In the end it's an amazing character study and I appreciated this aspect of it, despite its faults."
" Ending is horrible
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,1,Watched this long movie and the ending was absolutely horrible!!!! What a waste of time to only see there was no ending!!!
" Obsurd
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,2,"Wakefield is a plotless obsurdity, and a Hollywood example, that with the right A-Lister attached, cold shit can be served on a hot tin plate."

" The ultimate suburban nightmare (contains spoilers)
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,9,"Wakefield, as the name suggests, is the story of a man named Howard Wakefield who ""awakens"" to discover that his family does not want, need, miss or love him. The journey to this realization is suspenseful and at some point, if you are really tracking, your heart breaks for him. 
At first, hiding in the garage attic spying on his wife and kids for months at a time, watching them go from surprise, to grief, to healing, to an enjoyment of daily life far more satisfying than his dour nature would allow, seems the ultimate in manipulation and as a result, nothing more than Howard deserves. But there is more to Howard than his compulsive spying. His isolation manifests in a heightened spiritual childlike joy in nature. And his journey also reveals his deep love for his wife, whom he wooed and won to spite a challenger, but who is now absolutely central to his world. Howard makes his final move when that old challenger comes back into her life, months after Howard's closet is emptied, and the family's celebrations of the Christmas holiday demonstrate real and true joy without him. Howard then makes the sacrifice of returning to his family, so that they can find closure and get on with the business of ejecting and replacing him with his old rival. It is clear his wife will never know of either his deep feelings nor of his sacrifice; nor will she care. 
The existential despair of the male provider, the ostensible head of the family, has never been so beautifully wrought. Is he loved for himself, or as a meal ticket? This question was touched upon during the last episode of Mad Men, when Don Draper reacted sympathetically to a male participant of a support group who claimed that no one spoke to him at the dinner table. Howard was a man determined to find out what was behind that dining room table silence, and heartrendingly, succeeded in answering that question. A beautiful film noir that looks at the dark underbelly of the ""successful"" head of the household and the emotional price men can pay for their financial power. I think Brian Cranston deserves an Oscar. Nine stars because this film is just too darn creepily close to some very uncomfortable truths."
" Ending
",2018-04-26 00:00:00,4,What would happen if the movie was only just two min more long? Just wanted to what happens when he came back. It's really disappointing.
" Ending sucked!
",2018-04-26 00:00:00,2,"I was enjoying the movie thinking he will regret and return home. Then the old boyfriend comes in, he decides to return. It seems it's more about competition to me that he is returning...Blah blah blah...Then BAM movie ends! I would've rather him died and never had a chance to return, than this ending. 
Anyway, my opinion!"
" The Selfish Man ...
",2018-04-10 00:00:00,5,I find it interesting that as i read the reviews I don't see any that speaks to the fact that it wasn't until his rival appeared on the scene that he decided to make his presence known... Wakefield is a VERY selfish self absorbed individual it made for a good movie...but I'm not a fan of the character.
" A Long Wait for A Bad Ending
",2018-04-06 00:00:00,5,I love Bryan Cranston and Jennifer Garner but this movie needed to be cut down by at least 20 minutes. And after patiently waiting for the ending - it was so lazy. Come on writers - we deserved more.
" Do NOT waste your time
",2018-03-17 00:00:00,1,"If you enjoy watching psychotic middle aged men completely abandon their families while completely isolating themselves from society then this movie is for you!! Two exciting hours of watching Bryan Cranston become increasingly more disgusting and manipulative with the bonus of seeing him defecate in a bucket. After you survive those two hours, you are rewarded with the most insulting ending you will ever see in a movie. Not only, will you never get that time back, you will waste more time being angry at that complete bs ending AND writing a review on IMDB because the ending was seriously THAT bad."
" Cranston is excellent, but the film itself was something of a missed opportunity
",2018-03-14 00:00:00,3,"Successful and wealthy litigator Howard Wakefield (Bryan Cranston) suffers a nervous breakdown and decides to hide out in the family attic for several months. During these months, Howard observes his family continuing their lives without him and as time passes by his behaviour becomes increasingly erratic and he often wonders whether he can return back to his old life (or indeed if he wants to)...Wakefield bravely tries to tackle a rather complex issue - one of a man suffering a nervous breakdown which I suppose could be classed as a mental health issue. Howard, for me, was a rather complex character with a torrent of varying emotions - Cranston does an excellent job in trying to give some depth to his character. The issue I had is that I didn't find that the narrative had any real depth; the focus is on Howard spying on his family, but I found that the cause of his nervous breakdown was glossed over meaning that I could never identify with or really understand Howard's motivations. The film also doesn't show anything from his wife's perspective - Howard's narration gives us an idea of what she may be thinking, but more input or insight from her as a character might have made the film a tad more involving.Other more notable flaws/issues with this film lay with believability; I found it hard to believe that Howard could manage to hide out in his attic for months on end without being spotted by his family or any of his neighbours at any point - considering how often he is roaming around outside. Also I find it hard to believe that no-one would think to look in the attic at any point to see if he was hiding out in there? He steals food and drink from his own home, but his wife doesn't notice at any point. The idea of him also surviving for so long by eating thrown away leftovers is also something of a stretch in credibility.The main selling point with this film is Cranston; he gives the best performance by a mile and his multi-layered performance does make this film more tolerable than it otherwise would have been. Garner is OK, but she's given too little to work with to make an impression on the picture and the same can be said of the supporting cast.Wakefield for me was a disappointment and something of a missed opportunity - the script lacked the complexity and insight necessary to make this a good character study. I do like the idea of a man looking into his own life from the outside and seeing what life is like for his family without him being around (there are actually shades of It's a Wonderful Life in this film), but with so little depth to the script I basically found myself watching Cranston spying on Garner which after a while became rather one-note and tiresome."
" Keep hoping
",2018-03-12 00:00:00,2,First of all living in someones garage for a whole year and not getting noticed is impossible. This movie made no sense from start to finish.
" Did I miss something?
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,6,I realize the subject matter of the movie is basically about a man having an introspective period of their life and I do agree that lead is a wonderful actor but I have to question how it was delivered.Maybe I am biased against selfish arrogant lawyers who is constantly wanting to manipulate the people near him. If that is the intent so much more could have been done with it especially when he appears as homeless around others. It touched on it somewhat but did not show the additional challenges especially to a person's health. Might need to read the book it was based from when I have the time. I usually give a movie a 7 if I feel everyone should see it and it is worth their time. It gets a 6 from me.
" Don't be so literal
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,8,"The ending: This movie is fantasy, so why are so many people disappointed in the ending? Maybe he was never gone at all. Maybe the whole movie happened in just one day, inside his head, after the train stopped."
" opening music same as ""stranger things"" theme song?
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,5,Somewhat sure someone got the music from someone else....sounds so familiar....
" Will you stay awake?
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,2,"The opening credits lists so many different producers for this film, it is not surprising that this is such a mediocre and boring film. Every type of producer giving their penny's worth of opinion and not even bothering to figure out even at the script stage that this film will be dull as dishwater.Wakefield is an adaptation of EL Doctorow's short story. Howard Wakefield (Bryan Cranston) has a breakdown when his commuter train breaks down. When he gets home instead of entering his house, Howard hides in the attic of his garage observing his wife and children. Howard thinks his much younger wife will have an affair.As he spends the following months watching his house, the tedium is occasionally enlivened with various flashbacks as to how Howard met his wife Diana (Jennifer Garner.)"
" Mostly sad, sour, cynical ... and senseless?
",2018-02-20 00:00:00,6,"Those (few?) who watch Robin Swicord's 2016 offering ""Wakefield"" will not be surprised at her earlier involvement with ""Benjamin Button"" - there's the same kind of tone in there somewhere. Here Swicord turns to a Nathaniel Hawthorne (and later EL Doctorow) short story to make what seems like a VEEEERRRRY long story. Basically, we're expected to sit around for 106 minutes and look at very similar, grubby and at times also offputting scenes, while star and absolute dominant of the film Brian Cranston - as Howard Wakefield - also sits around and makes comments on the life of the wife (played somewhat seductively by Jennifer Garner) and two daughters he has abruptly decided to leave ... without trace, for some months. He is able to do this, because he's in fact living hobo-like in a kind of outhouse building that overlooks their place, and he has a pair of good binoculars to watch the unfolding scene... He's rather sad to be apart from his family, but also sad about what life with that family had been like before. And he comes to the conclusion that, while maybe he was not the easiest or most dynamic of men, he was basically the hardworking funder of his family's activities, yet less and less recognised for his efforts as day followed day and month followed month.He rather quickly becomes convinced that the three are better off and happier without him, and was clearly on the point of becoming invisible at home even before he REALLY vanished... If the film has a point - and it's slightly debatable - it lies in the way we become so terribly blasé about relationships that do still have love in them in fact (as Howard realises once he is separated). Even when we are there, we are half-absent, regularly irritated, and not really trying hard enough. Of course, modern life with its rat race, trivialities, mountains of stressful nothingnesses and lack of time makes everything worthless get in the way of what really matters, so maybe it's not fully our fault. ""Concentrating the mind wonderfully"" by today's standards means husbands calling their wives from the supermarket on the way home to discuss the choice of yoghurt; and it's all so far from the elemental, tough-but-more-real days when a man went down the mine, or to battle, or off to sea, or into the field or the woods, and the dangers might be such that there was no absolute certainty he would ever be seen again. So Howard decides - abruptly enough - to emulate those days of yore by not being seen again. As time passes, he begins to realise what he's missing, but also reflects on all the many, many things he did not much like about his chosen woman, with whom he nevertheless sympathises, and for whom he feels growing love. How mixed up is that? Perhaps as mixed up as many a modern-day marriage.He wants her to need him, but she seems just to press on with life. He would like her to be heartbroken, but she isn't, so that ought to be his cue to get out of there. But he doesn't ... or can't.For much of the film thereafter, we in the audience feel palpable tension as to whether this is all going to end with something - or with nothing - resolved; with no closure at all. Given the cynical tone of much of the film we naturally fear the worst.And the ending is as it is...Some of us - maybe many of us - in married life do actually NEED the message that this film has to give us; but few if any are likely to make the effort to stick with and get it. But even if we watch just a few minutes, we could try and do better than Howard Wakefield, and seek not to make his mistakes. But will we actually do so? And CAN we actually do so, with the modern world dragging us down?Clearly this is not a worthless film, though the dry-as-dust Cranston has a hard job evoking much sympathy in us, and - in the end - maybe this tale was best left on the printed page, as opposed to on screen?"

" Let down by poor ending
",2018-01-30 00:00:00,2,"I see no point In going over the same ground as previous reviews. Two massive flaws. The first, is that you have absolutely no idea of the time scale, Cranston's character is ''elsewhere'', 2nd, if you honestly believe, there is nothing wrong with the ending, you're giving the writer credit, he does not deserve. It reminds me of a long winded joke someone once told me, where the character is about to deliver the punchline....you say to the joke teller, so what did the piece of paper say.?!! ...don't know, he dropped it in the water...."
" A shame
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,5,"A movie that drew me in, great internal dialogue, brilliant performance by Bryan Cranston, a believable plot - a guy cracks up and makes the ludicrous decision to live in his own garage's attic and spy on his family.Wakefield is a devious character and not very likable but Cranston's riveting performance engages the viewer from the beginning until about 10 minutes from the end when the plot falls apart.An impossible ending, contempt for the viewer writ large.I give it a 5/10 for Cranston's stellar performance but what on earth were the writers thinking?"
" Not about depression at all.
",2018-01-13 00:00:00,9,So much going on in this film that everyone should watch. I doubt many will understand or relate to what happened in this man's life. I do.
" Loved it
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,9,"Greetings from Lithuania.What a pleasant surprise for me was ""Wakefield"" (2016). A drama without any action or suspense with a very simple premise that kept me glued to my screen. ""Wakefield"" (2016) is a great and kinda unique character study drama. Its about character that was before, i now during a transformation and which will be after transformation. Acting was superb (as usual) from a great Bryan Cranston. Writing and directing were also superb - at running time 1 h 45 min i was never bored or lost my interest in this kinda unique and haunting movie. Loved it."
" An amazing picture
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,10,"I won't go into great detail about this one. The movie shows a successful businessman with the same routine every single day who decides to detach from everyday life and live in the attic of his own home, overlooking his family and everything that happens during his disappearance. Brian Cranston does an amazing job, as always, showing an in depth defragmentation of a seemingly happy person.*SPOILERS*Now, at the moment the movie starts, we see a character who has it all. A beautiful wife, a lovely, suburban home, 2 daughters. Happy little family. Or so it seems. As the movie progresses, we slowly begin to find out aspects of his life which were unknown. His wife doesn't show him the love he feels he deserves, and neither do his daughters. He asks himself at one point ""When did those three become a separate group?"". This comes with an insane amount of psychological burden, as all of us sometimes feel like we simply don't belong. He also points out that he hasn't seen his daughters laugh in over a year, which he now gets a chance to do, watching them from the attic window.
Many people are criticizing the ending. I, for one, think it's brilliant. He imagined 2 possible scenarios: first, his wife and kids would be extremely happy to see him, and second, they would be scared and wouldn't dare to greet him. What happened was neither of the two, it was simply shock. It's not a conventional ending, which is what I love about it.
This is simply an amazing, first person view into an emotional breakdown. It also carries a strong message that you shouldn't take your loved ones likely."
" Lost time
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,4,"This move got me intrigued for a while and I specifically waiting and avoided to read or see any reviews because I wanted to experience this movie from a blank slate. when we got the end credits of this movie I was left with a feeling of '2-hours lost i'm never getting back' What a waste of time and talent. I can sit for hours and watch Bryan Cranston act but this whole execution of an attempt to make a movie was a total miss by it's creators. Cranston is amazing to see and hear and to see him pull this sloppy story and script off with the class he brings is a a miracle. The makeup was terrible and inconsistent. The music score didn't know what it wanted to be (minimalistic, adventurous, Clint-Eastwoodesk Piano style, Jazz, Noir..) it's all over the place. The Down Syndrome actors where a disgrace to watch at, the director or editor or casting agent should be ashamed for the way these characters are brought to the screen and the way the are portrait as story filler / forced-endearing tool. There's more then smiling, pointing and repeating names and words! And the most disappointing thing of it all. The ending! I understand you want to play off the whole 'open end' feeling, but this is just bad bad writing and cinematic execution. We do not need any more discomfort at the end, it's been enough of that sitting through it all."
" A man who looked after his family! Literally!
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,8,"It was like 'Rear Window' meets 'Castaway on the Moon'. A unique film, pretty much pointless, though the world is full of crazy people and everything can be possible. Originally it was based on the short short of the same name. Directed by a writer turned filmmaker. Most of the film was a background narration, despite the story was not a flashback. Because it has less direct dialogues between the characters.Howard Wakefield is married with two kids. A hardworking man to provide everything to his family. But seems he's not happy anymore as they are ignoring him lately. A perfect opportunity gives him a chance to know what his family can do with his absence. It might bring an end to all his doubts. Without any pre-plan, the event unfolds, but how long and the consequences, all focused on the later parts.Bryan Cranston was really good. He's lately making some good films. Though I felt he was a little old for this kind of role. The rest of the cast was okay, mainly Jennifer Garner. The story was simple, but engaging. Maybe a new way to the self-discovery. I was looking forward to how the end would happen. That's a little disappointment, yet a very safe play, regarding how the prior events took place.Most of the people would expect a normal cinematic narration, like with all those things, twist and turns. But this was very much like a real life, except that how Howard survived a very long time in the attic and going unnoticed. The flashback really added some interesting flavour. When you are quite clearly rooting for Howard, that old story could change your stance, perhaps to neutral. They had created a great atmosphere, the event, but I felt it all became vain when the end was not clearly says what's the consequence. Whatever, I liked it and I surely suggest it.8/10"
" An enjoyable movie, with a disappointing ending
",2017-11-29 00:00:00,4,"While Bryan Cranstons casting and an intriguing hide in the garage plot is largely enjoyable, the climax is disappointing.We watch as Cranston fails to return home, hides in the garage and watches his family as a missing person.When he does finally walk back through the Door, the film ends. Very disappointing, how did he explain himself, was he accepted back into the arms of his wife and children? Who knows..Is this just a ruse for a sequel, I think not, but it left me deflated and wanting to know what happened next.. Avoid."
" Not To Be Missed! (If it is a choice between this or the electric chair)
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,2,"Wow! What a riveting piece of absolute vacuity. I was spellbound. And being a big fan of Raccoon who was marvelous in ""The Nut Job"", it was a real treat. For me he just stole the movie, especially with him and Cranston in the same scene – double wow! He really put everything into perspective. I hope he gets nominated for something.Others have complained about the weak ending. Woe is me. Just be be thankful for small mercies, you can't have everything. At least we got the sorry beginning and the nothing middle. You should ask God for forgiveness.And there is no denying the mesmerising dialogue, such as, ""Forgive me if I don't stand and watch as another man lays claim to your affections."" Or, ""Aha, a city fella, eh?"" And the standout brilliance of, ""My, my, coffee and dessert in the living room. This is a special evening."""
" Difficult watch
",2017-11-09 00:00:00,3,"I'm probably not alone in loving Bryan Cranston from Breaking Bad. Main reason for watching this film is that he was in it and was interested to see how he was moving on from TV. Have to confess that had mixed feelings.Wakefield tells the story of Howard (Cranston) who is suffering a nervous breakdown and decides to go into hiding. He chooses somewhere very close to home, so that he can keep an eye on what's happening. Overall the acting is very good and much of the film is focused on Howard. Having said that it is a pretty dreary watch and very hard to find any compassion for any of the characters. If anybody is looking for an adrenaline movie they should stick well clear of this movie. Very much for people who love to watch Cranston act and even they may find it a bit of a tough watch."
" Could have been more interesting
",2017-11-06 00:00:00,6,"Wakefield is a film starring Bryan Cranston as the man who hides in a garage for months looking at the events in his house and everyone thinking he's missing. Basically, he's looking at his life without him.It's an interesting premise on it's own, but the movie never really does anything about that and the plot barely goes anywhere through the entire movie. And yeah, don't expect much of a resolution at the end. This is something that works on paper, but doesn't translate to the screen very well. One of the biggest problems is also a lack of interesting and creative direction. If a director made it stranger and more unique, it would have been a lot more interesting. This way, it just doesn't stick out. But still, it's filled with powerful performances, especially from Bryan Cranston, who never fails to impress and pretty much carries the entire movie with his performance and he might be one of the few reasons it wasn't completely uninteresting. The premise itself, a few interesting but not memorable enough moments and the premise are what saves this movie from being bad. But it's not particularly good either. While the run-time isn't long the movie is longer than it should be and by the last third the end can't come soon enough. Only watch if you're a big fan of Cranston. Other than that, you won't find much here."
" Contrived
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,1,Wall-to-wall music. Unnecessary voice-over. Ridiculous visual metaphors. I felt sorry for the actor trying to do his best in a horribly written and directed film. The film industry is falling deeper and deeper into the Land of Mediocrity. I will add this sentence to fulfill five lines of text under the guideline rules. Bye.
" Entertaining but a little pointless
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,5,"Bryan Cranston did a great job as always, but the plot was a little drawn out. Interesting idea for a movie, there isn't much explanation as to why he hid away for so long and why no-one ever checked the attic, but quirky and funny at times. The ending was a little frustrating but overall a decent but not amazing movie."
" A film that's different it shows life from one's own point of view, with isolation.
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,7,"""Wakefield"" is a different kind of film it shows what it's like when one takes their own self out of the daily rat race of life and hides away to reflect and watch the world from their own point of view. The story is around Howard Wakefield(Bryan Cranston)a high powered attorney who has it all only one day he decides to remove himself from life and family after a breakdown of nerves and go away and live in the attic. As in his time away Howard does reflect on the past with life, choices, and family, and sees the wife away from a distant view as his love now is just sight seeing of Diana(the sexy Jennifer Garner)who's an elegant and upscale trophy black bra wearing kind of wife. Thru it all the world is now just a different take and look for Howard as he sees the reflection of light and life in the end. Overall good film that shows and proves that many should take a break and different look at life from an outsider approach as to isolate time and thoughts are many times good for the healing of the mind and soul."

" Lost in the attic
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,7,"Who would have thought a movie about a man hiding in his garage spying on his family would work? However what starts out as odd and off-putting, ends up still odd but totally absorbing.Howard Wakefield (Bryan Cranston) is a successful New York lawyer with a beautiful wife, Diana (Jennifer Garner), twin daughters and house in an upmarket suburb. Then he suddenly leaves it all behind, he vanishes, but he doesn't go far; he ends up in the attic above his garage studying the lives of his family and his neighbours. As months pass, he lives like a hermit, stealing food from garbage bins at night, but as he studies the others he actually begins to understand more about himself.Although set in modern day, in a way the Wakefield family seem like a typical family from the 1950s; Howard Wakefield could almost be ""The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit"". Or maybe suburban life just hasn't changed all that much despite smartphones, drones and personal trainers.The film reminds me of a couple of others where a guy drops out of suburban life and dumps family and responsibility: ""Kiss the Sky"" with William Peterson and ""Tom White"", an Australian movie starring Colin Friels.Unlike the others, Howard does not experience extracurricular sex; a 'new cookie' isn't on his agenda. He just seems alienated from the world that was the norm for most of his life.""Wakefield"" has a light touch but it isn't a comedy. A number of times Howard asks the audience if everybody at some time or other hasn't thought of walking away and starting over? However underlying the whole thing is the feeling that what he is doing to his family, particularly Diana, is cruel. She simply doesn't deserve it. Of course as the movie progresses Howard realises that the problems with his life are mostly of his own doing.""Wakefield"" sneaks up on you. Although the ending is tricky, it's in keeping with the rest of the movie, which is unexpected to say the least."

",2017-09-07 00:00:00,5,"Even in the movie, the obvious is stated: who hasn't had a thought about leaving their life and watching how people from that life react to them being gone missing? This movie explores that scenario. It's somewhat original, so, it's interesting.The exploration has some interesting parts. Jenifer Garner is well cast as the wife whom the main character ""kind of loves"", but is also ""sick and tired of her"". Also, the whole projection that the protagonist has on his wife as ""his main problem"", which she clearly isn't, is interesting. Sure, she's far from perfect, but, so is he and it's obvious that he actually ""did good, wife-wise"" (in the sense that he could have done _much_ worse).Also, the notion that he just goes on with his exile without having any good reason to, other than inertia, is interesting.But, otherwise, it's not well put together, very little is deeply explored, there's not much fun or dread of all of this - while there can/should be.The main problem is probably the ending. Sure, the ""let the viewer think/imagine what might happen"" ending can work. But, it needs to be done differently, especially with a movie as-is. Basically, the ending doesn't fit the movie at all. If we had more deep explorations, sure, this could work. But, as-is, movie is too shallow for such an ending."
" Pure Garbage
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,1,"Hollywood horse manure about the true meaning of life. This film is a rip off of the Kirk Doughlas film, The Arrangement and honestly the Arrangement was a much better film. Film makers always want the public to believe that most successful people are miserable and unfulfilled and that they are holding on by the tips of their fingers before having a complete meltdown. I find it hard to believe that eating out of a garbage can and going to the toilet in the bushes or a plastic bottle will give me the meaning of life. I am sorry, but this film is idiotic and totally unbelievable. Trash is a perfect review for a film in which the main character becomes a complete disgusting trash bucket, but somehow finds the meaning to life."

A man who stole the love of his life from his close friend, lived with the illusion that his wife will seduce anybody coming close to her, even after having a great job, two lovely daughters and a beautiful wife he cant live at ease. So he chose in a moment of lucidity to isolate himself from his life, just watching his absence and what it will affect the cycle of life! And to his surprise he found that the problem was in himself, his insecurities is what got him there in the first place, but that is how life can do to you if you calculated every move, everything you have by a bank account, by a winning game, life is not a game, it is not what weight we own of gold, but what color and what sense do we feel that gold! He discovered that moments of happiness can not be bought, you can live without materials but mercy and love are the juice of life! Then fear got over him, what if everybody knows his deepest secrets will they continue to love him or throw him in the garbage literally!! When he had overcome both materials and fear, he became the human he respects and started to live!"
" Wakefield - Movie Review
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,1,"Nobody knows where Howard Wakefield is or what happened to him, but he does, and he's laughing it up while his wife and kids are grieving. All we're doing is watching a man being selfish, doing selfish things, and continuing to be selfish even though the movie is trying to tell me that he's currently feeling empathy. Wakefield went on a journey of self- discovery. I understood what this movie was going for, but I thought it failed because Howard Wakefield as a character ultimately didn't make any sense by the end of it all.For a more in-depth review, check out my video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKlzTlAYKD4"
" A brilliant inside view to one's mind
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,10,"It is a brilliant film or at least story. I don't feel it is about voyeurism but a way to show how rules of society play a lead role in our lives. We don't feel or stop to enjoy what is around us because everything around us must be done in a certain way and time. As I see it, we are becoming less human and more like robots where instincts are non-existent and rules, protocols and sense of control are the focus.I believe everyone should stop at some point in their lives and look at everything around them through a different perspective. I loved it although I would have changed the end. It would be interesting to see the reactions and thoughts of his family to the reason of his disappearance and search of oneself."
" it will happen to most of us...

During his introspection we don't come to appreciate him, actually he is pretty much an asshole giving sarcastic comments on the events and people in the house he has left, and the way he tricked his best friend with his later wife. During his introspective he however comes more and more in peace with himself, his past and reason to step out (put your life on pause) falls in love again with his wife and in the end decides to walk back into his house on Xmas eve...but never get to see how the family responds but that is completely not relevant, that is for the viewer to fill in."
" Living with the Raccoons
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,9,"Like another film ""Colossal"", with a very different approach, both films deal with how we become prisoners within ourselves to our most selfish traits. In this case it's the material, possession oriented lives that separate us from some very remarkable, taken for granted, wonders of life such as love, selflessness, appreciation of the beauty in nature. Our central character, a wealthy, suburb living lawyer with a typical family, starts the film by berating a scavenging raccoon, and in classical Greek irony becomes that raccoon (figuratively). While chasing raccoons from his garage attic he takes a moment to observe his family in his adjacent home though a window in the garage's attic. It is then that his journey of transformation begins in which, as he watches and ponders, begins to question his values. He now goes officially missing as he lives off of what he scavenges all the while holed up in the attic. Great acting, creative script, and very intelligent Socratic monologue examining his life. I would have ended the story with him taking a bus across country, and upon planned discovery he feigns amnesia for his long missing sojourn."
" Biggest Anticlimax
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,1,"To put it frankly, I feel like I've just been robbed of 1hr and 46minutes of my life. I saw the film through hoping that the end would make the rest of it a little less shocking but no that didn't happen. That's 1hr 46minutes I'll never see again.Bryan Cranston should have stuck to being Walter White because his career just took a right nosedive."
" ...but what did he learn?
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,6,"I enjoyed most of the movie and Cranston did a great job, but at the end, I had no idea what he had learned from this experience. To me, it appeared that the family went on to live happily without him. I seemed that he didn't learn anything or want to change anything about himself. I just see a mean spirited person that gets jealous when his old pal and rival starts dating his wife and then decides to come back home.The film was well made but the plot could have been so so much more...Shame."
" Possible Spoiler - Overall Feedback
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,1,"Every single movie has a specific type of plot: Beginning, description of the main theme, action and result. This movie has no result though?? We spent 2 hours of our time watching Bryan Cranston exploring himself and we can't see the result of his actions? What kind of director does that? Why do you leave us imagine about a thousand of different conclusions? The whole movie is absolutely perfect, Bryan Cranston is perfect(not something we didn't know before) but the end left me completely disappointed."
" New Gauguin
",2017-08-08 00:00:00,8,"Howard voluntarily becomes a bum, but the one ""with some amenities,"" because he lives not in a street box, but in his own garage, opposite his own house. And no one knows about it. Well, except, perhaps, two children with mental deviations.Sounds like a comedy beginning but this is not. It's more like a parable, for in this way the idea of finding yourself through tons of human conventions, prohibitions and rules is carried out.The only thing that confused me - almost all the hero's thoughts are about his wife. It seems like Howard is constantly thinking about her and only her for months! This fact does not really fit in with the inner liberation of the individual. It is more like the aggravation of his mental disorder. Still I think it's just a small drawback of the script, for the overall impression of the hero's transformation is completely different.The movie has a nice ending. One of those which are called ""think for yourselves"". Only this time such a finale does not irritate me, because it does not matter how the relatives react to the return of their prodigal father. The only thing that matters is the great changes in Howard.Of course, Brian Cranston here reminds us his legendary Walter from ""Breaking Bad"", but this similarity of characters is very successful. And maybe even intentional)."
" Like Nymphomaniac, Wakefield's ending spoils the rest of the film
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,8,"God, I hate it how the one thing you don't want to have happen - happens!What an amazing story this was, and what a frightening depiction of food waste, not to mention the other things people discard that others would kill for. A man who chooses to eschew the world because he's fed up with the status quo, but instead of running off to another part of the world, he just moves into another section of his house (which could indicate his attachment not only to his wife but to his lifestyle as well, and that for all the talk and braggadocio of letting go, he really doesn't let go at all).The scrounging was what affected me the most. All that food that people throw away, and Cranston is out there shuffling around and dirtying his hands collecting this food from the garbage, eating it and eventually getting sick from it. Was that an indictment on us viewers? How many of you waste food? How many of you will think twice before throwing away food, after watching this film?And how many of you are ready to discard it all? Maybe the final scene is proof of the illusion, the idea that you may think you're detached, but the pull is too strong, the attraction is too powerful to resist completely. ""I'm home"" leads to the reconciliation, leads to the 9 to 5, leads back to the status quo.Oh, but if only he had continued walking, away from it all, driving his Mercedes to somewhere else. If only the celibate man who listened to all the sexual escapades that woman had gone through, if only he could have closed that door and the movie faded to black right then and there (you'll have to see both parts of Nymphomaniac to understand what I'm talking about). If only these two men could have resisted the attraction, and walked on, I would have given both of them 10/10 without hesitation. But sadly the attraction to the status quo is too strong, the attraction towards simple endings and happy endings and resolutions is too powerful, and here we are, back to square one. Unresolved, unchanged, undermined."
" A Character Study of a Thoroughly Repulsive Character
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,5,"Just watch the trailer instead. Set to Claude Debussy's timeless Clair de Lune, it's infinitely more beautiful and poetic than Wakefield itself. Robin Swicord obviously reveres the film's source material, a short story of the same name by Nathaniel Hawthorne, but the film's admittedly intriguing premise simply cannot sustain itself over its 106-minute runtime. The film follows suburbanite Howard Wakefield, a New York attorney who spontaneously decides to spend the night in the attic of his home's detached garage after an encounter with a raccoon. Upon waking up, he decides to stay there, essentially abandoning his wife and children and living in seclusion, foraging for food and keeping his location secret as he watches them move on with their lives.The film's biggest asset is the performances, with Bryan Cranston delivering a powerhouse turn as Wakefield. Cranston, who appears in nearly all of the film's scenes, is perhaps the only thing that makes the film worth watching to the end. He single-handedly carries the film's weight on his shoulders, which also extensively uses narration from his character throughout. Meanwhile, Jennifer Garner also delivers a great performance in a role with relatively little dialogue as Wakefield's wife Diana. For the majority of the film, save for a few flashbacks, Diana remains distant from the viewer as we watch her solely from Wakefield's perspective. And yet Garner still makes the most of it, as we watch her struggle to come to terms with Wakefield's sudden disappearance.The performances, however, aren't enough to save a film that feels woefully misguided. For one, Wakefield is an entirely unlikeable character who willingly abandons his responsibility as both a father and a spouse. And although Wakefield's sometimes fourth-wall breaking narration at least offers a cursory acknowledgment that Wakefield recognizes his transgressions, it also tries to somewhat justify his actions, a decision that misfires. Additionally, the film also reeks of toxic masculinity, with Wakefield sometimes commenting on the control he now has over his wife due to his disappearance. While I usually refrain from commenting on a film's portrayal of masculinity and/or femininity, I simply cannot glance over the toxic actions that Wakefield perpetuates. While the film could be seen as a commentary on white privilege, especially in regards to how Wakefield is able to abandon his family without worrying about their financial security, it isn't smart enough to develop these ideas. When watching Diana from afar, Wakefield often comments that he now loves her more than ever, but his actions fail to reconcile with his thoughts. Wakefield is among the most selfish, detestable characters in cinema. Even if he doesn't rape a woman to the tune of Singin' in the Rain à la Alex DeLarge, at least Kubrick's film proved a thoroughly engrossing character study of its violent central protagonist. On the other hand, Wakefield slowly runs out of reasons for being, lurching forwards to an outright cheat of an ending that proves wholly unsatisfying.Wakefield has been on my radar ever since I saw the trailer. Unfortunately, the finished product fails to capture the poetic and thoughtful qualities that made the two-minute promo so fascinating. The combined talents of Cranston and Garner are squandered by an ill- conceived misfire of a story that makes the mistake of allowing a thoroughly loathsome character to be its focal point."
" For mature movie watchers
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,8,"No, this movie is not like watching paint dry, it is about watching a person drop out and tune into the petty and superficial aspects of the self. Rather it's a ""nervous breakdown"" or not Cranston does wonders with his physiognomy and gait. No, this is not an action movie or a RomCom, but a study in character and psychology does require patience, as does sipping a good glass of wine, no need to gulp, enjoy the moments, the good and the bad."
" Out of all the possible great or decent endings, they picked the only worst one.
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,5,"What a let down in the writing department. Did the brain juices run dry in the last 5 minutes of this film?Aside from the very slow pace, this film of 1:46 should have been edited and cut down to about 1:20-1:25.Now back to the writing; Director and writer Robin Swicord did an outstanding job in the directing - very visually masterful and well put together. The writing was outstanding - until the ending. To put it in simple terms, she attacked and challenged your senses, intellect and sensibility, and then flushed it all down the toilet with the worst (and laziest) ending possible. Very insulting.Here's an idea: what if he walked in and he was invisible i.e. he died in the train (crash) that led to the black-out. There are so many better endings this film could have had, but instead, Robin Swicord picked the worst (and laziest) possible ending. Yes, I had to say it again... it was that dumb and made me feel that I wasted investing my time from the start in looking forward to a great (at least a decent) ending. Nope. The exciting roller coaster ride ended at the kids basket weaving class.It even makes me feel sour at Bryan Cranston's outstanding performance, wasted with that infantile ending dialogue. The success of a film is how you feel when you leave the theater. This left me feeling mad - and it wasn't an angry movie. Even with the slow place (of which I hate) that I put up with, I still had a smile on my face most of the time with Cranston's humor and brilliant performance, and was thoroughly getting right into the film anticipating a grand finale. I had already rated this prematurely as an 8-9/10, until the ending. Because of that fail, it's only a 5/10. What a waste a a potentially great film... shame."
" You will love this...If you like to watch paint dry.
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,3,"Had high hopes for this one. Love Bryan Cranston as an actor, but lets be realistic. Anyone can do voice overs and then play the part of a guy sitting in an attic for a year. Don't watch this movie after 8pm. You might actually think you are 90 years old and fall asleep. This movie offers a lot of nothing. If you like the movie PHONE BOOTH, then this movie might be for you. When I watch a movie, I like a few things. One of the things that is on the top of my list is a plot. You know....the part of the movie that tells a story. Don't get me wrong. This movie had a plot. A bad one! Just read the summary of the movie before you watch it and then watch something else since you just told yourself what the movie was about. Sad that some true stories will get pushed off to the side in Hollywood, but this one sticks. I hope some people take my advice in this review, because i would like to salvage some of your Friday nights when starting to watch a movie."
" Not a classic, but a pretty good movie
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,6,"Bryan Cranston does a good job in this engaging movie about a New York lawyer who has a nervous breakdown and hides in his attic from his family for a year, living on what he scavenges from rubbish bins. The movie is based on a DL Doctorow short story. Jennifer Garner's role as his (sexy) wife is underwritten but she does a good job in the role.It's not a thriller, but it bears comparison to Hitchcock's Rear Window. The movie is essentially a study in urban loneliness and isolation, with just a couple of references to Robinson Crusoe to pin the whole thing down. We don't really learn what triggered the breakdown, just that it happened. I don't think it's too far fetched to suggest that somebody could hide from his family in his attic for so long (my wife never ventures into the garage or the attic!) and anyway the movie makes it seem plausible. I liked it, it engaged me, and I'd recommend it."
" I want my 2 hours back
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,2,"I would have rated this a 1 but Garner shows some pretty spectacular side boob, so that's gotta be worth something, if only for the fact that I didn't even know she had boobs to speak of.Besides that, however, this movie will leave you feeling regretful of the two hours you've sliced out of your life to watch it.Guy decides to one day abandon his wife and kids to go live in the attic where he has a good view of the dining room and spies on his family for a few months. We never figure out why he's so unhappy with his marriage and life since it's revealed at several points that he's the jerk in all of this to begin with. Now if he was an interesting jerk, that might have made a good movie, but oh my God, this is one boring mundane douchebag. We get to watch his family do ordinary everyday things and hear his inner monologue express the most unsurprising ordinary thoughts.If your life is so unbelievably boringly mundane that you enjoy this movie, I can only feel pity for you."
" I loved watching Howard's descent into madness
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,7,"Howard is a successful man with a beautiful wife & twin girls. They have a beautiful home. Really, he has it all-seemingly.

From there, he stands watching his family going about their 'thing' from the attic window. He does not go home..Howard's narration takes over from here really & is necessary. He is almost hilarious in his madness but also quite devastating. You realise that Howard is actually quite a cruel man who hasn't lived his life particularly morally. Also, everything is told from Howard's perspective. There is only how he sees his wife, his children, etc**POSSIBLE SPOILERS**Okay, he carries on this voyeuristic role, scavenging & becoming a typical 'hobo' type UNTIL his place in his families life is truly challenged by his old nemesisBut the end-what the actual bleep??

" An eyeopener for everyone!
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,9,"Wakefield was an eyeopener for everyone, who doesn't feel comfortable in his, our in her work or relationship. Despite earning a lot of money, possessing the biggest house, wearing the finest suits and driving the biggest cars, people can be unlucky. Wakefield is described as a drama. Seeing the movie, I felt that this description was a little bit too much. I would say that Wakefield was more a personal sad documentary seen through the eyes of the ""victim"" Mr. Bryan Cranston is Wakefield. The transformation of Mr.Wakefield is outstanding, in the beginning and at the end and of the time-line, Wakefield is filled with amusing, funny, surprising and emotional moments. The end of the movie could also be the beginning of our own, first step, becoming a Mr.or Mrs. Wakefield. A big thumb t all other actors in this movie, but especially to Emily and Herbert!"
" (A)Wake field
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,7,"Cranston becomes a social runaway, end of story. There exists a monologue of marriage becoming routine amongst a spicy ""flirtation"" fuse, a punch the white collar clock monotony, distance between family born of familiarity begats contempt/vacuum, which Never gets resolved (OK he walks in - back (whatever that means) during Christmas. What, Born Again? I didn't get it, I don't care."
" The Film is very intectuall made
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,5,"The Film is made very intellectually. From a third person observer perspective. In a psychologycal and philosophical way. For example, how actions and reactions taking place through thoughts. How thought or thinking operates and how the thought or mind controls you and not the other way around. I like the movie a lot it is in a sense of user experience showing on screen . Great Style a lot of insights."
" Fascinatingly Introspective
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,9,"Let's start first with Bryan Cranston's performance. When watching this movie, I think it would be easy for someone to overlook just how good he is. 85% of the movie is Cranston sitting in a room talking to himself, and yet he is able to bring such dimension and drama to it. He makes it look so easy and natural, and that's why it would be easy to overlook his performance. He absolutely carries the film, and it does not work without his ability as an actor. Jennifer Garner is also really good in this movie, however she is absolutely outshined by how brilliant Cranston is. Her role was also minute enough that really anyone could have played her character, whereas I don't think just anyone could have played Howard Wakefield. What struck me most about Wakefield was how much of a character study it was. It was actually more of a situational study. What does an average human being reduce themselves to when stripped of all their possessions? When they become entirely deprogrammed from society? This idea has been explored before, in films like Cast Away, but never quite in this way..."
" WEAK-field
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,1,"""Hi Honey - I'm home! And I've always been home! Surprise!""This movie was ludicrous, a word whose definition is: so foolish, unreasonable, or out of place as to be amusing; ridiculous. WEAK-field was just that. A rich, privileged lawyer, with a beautiful house, wife and family, decides to take a vacation from life - in his own detached garage's attic, ten feet from his family. For a movie that spanned a few months, Bryan Cranston ended up looking like Tom Hanks in Cast Away. He scrounged for food, shoes and other necessities in garbage cans, dumpsters and neighbors' trash, yet, he had a wallet full of money and a nice watch. The whole special-needs kids angle was manipulative and unnecessary.He watched his crying wife, bitchy mother-in-law and teen daughters live without him - with everything happening either in the driveway or in front of 2 or 3 big windows without drapes. Speaking of windows... Why did no one ever happen to glance up and catch him out of the corner of their eye? Why did the cops only visit the house once, and, why didn't they search the property? The guy was in the freakin' attic!Finally, why, one day around Christmas time, does he decide to go back? This movie was indeed ludicrous and weak(field.)"
" Worth seeing
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,8,"This is definitely worth seeing for Bryan Cranston's performance. Some random observations/thoughts: The interesting twist on this is that here we have a man who is leaving his family but actually just staying right next to them to watch them the whole time. The pain of that is palpable - it's almost as though he has done so to re-evaluate all the choices he has made and to examine those in his family (his wife in particular) as a way of connecting with himself somehow. This is more involved than a simple movie about escape, because he doesn't really change his identity, he more just vanishes to the people he loves and lets circumstances control the rest. There is something disconnected about Howard generally, and perhaps he has become a stranger to himself, in the sense that the life he has lead up until the point he leaves is not really ""him"" somehow.The ending is fairly frustrating but I think it makes the point that it's almost not about what happens when he returns but about the transformation or introspection and internal searching that happen when he leaves his life yet is right there ""next to it"" somehow.The thing I had trouble with as a parent of young kids, is that the kids are almost an afterthought somehow - clearly he cares about them but perhaps it has been so long since he had connected with the children it was less of a conflicted thing for him. He seems to rationalize leaving by saying they are all happier without him."
" Suburban Life...At A Distance
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,9,"Routine is a part of life. Most of us get up, go to work, and come home for a brief respite. Rinse, dry, repeat, until we retire. While those schedules and routines can be good in terms of consistency and work performance, they also can be killer on the soul. That is what we see transpire in ""Wakefield"", about a man being given the opportunity to view his family life from a distance...and without him in it.For a basic plot summary, ""Wakefield"" proposes an interesting scenario: Coming home from a long day at the office, Howard Wakefield (Bryan Cranston) sees his night go even a bit longer when his subway train gets stuck in the tunnel. Wearily, he finally arrives home but doesn't want to go inside and likely fight with wife Diana (Jennifer Garner) about his whereabouts. Instead, a wayward raccoon provides an ample distraction, scampering up into the garage attic and requiring Howard to give chase. Tired and by now completely unwilling to head inside, Howard dozes in an easy chair...and sleeps until morning. Initially panicked by his nighttime adventure, Howard quickly realizes that he can make some interesting observations about his family and life from his unseen perch. A night of seclusion turns into a day, which turns into multiple days, and suddenly the ball is rolling downhill. He's declared missing and likely would be thought insane for his odd seclusion. On an even deeper level, though, Howard has little desire to re-introduce himself back into his family and old life, finding his newfound ""clean slate"" rather exhilarating and informative (from the observation of his children, wife, and daily home comings-and-goings). How long will Wakefield keep his hideaway up? Will he ever re-introduce himself into his old life again? What does he learn about himself through the entire process. Those are the questions the film answers in the rest of its run-time.What makes ""Wakefield"" such a fascinating film is the way it taps into the concept of wanting to ""get away"" from one's life. In theme, it is quite similar to Kevin Spacey's character in ""American Beauty"". The key difference, however, is that while Spacey's character interacted with his family members while trying to get through his suburban life crisis, Mr. Wakefield is given the opportunity to view his from a distance. By removing himself from the picture, so to speak, Howard is able to more objectively view and see his family and life for what they really are. This causes him to go through many personality and emotional changes, which is the type of journey perfect for an emotional cinematic experience.Only helping matters is the tremendous casting choices. Cranston plays the ""weary, middle- aged every-man"" perfectly (as he is known to do), and his narration might be the best in the business this side (or any side) of Morgan Freeman. This is a film where most of the ""dialogue"" is really internal monologue, so it is a perfect use of Cranston's talents in that area. Also giving a sneaky-good performance is Garner as Mrs. Wakefield. She mainly shines in the flashbacks used to flesh out the characters while Howard observes from his perch, but even in scenes where she is just being observed, her movements and facial expressions need to (and can) convey quite a bit.A piano score that can be both melancholy & comedic peppers the score, while certain songs used in other interludes are perfect for the moment.About the only reason I can't give this the full ten-star ranking is because I feel like perhaps a few scenes were played a bit too much for comedy (probably to showcase Cranston's fearlessness in that department) when instead they could perhaps have focused on even deeper issues.Overall, though, that is a very small complaint for what is otherwise a gem of a film. It's too bad ""Wakefield"" didn't get a larger theatrical run (I only saw it in theaters because I happened to be in LA at the time it was released0, as it is a movie that I think many audiences could deeply relate too. Hopefully, it will catch on in the rental market and attract some buzz.For those who enjoy a thoughtful, introspective film-watching experience (but also one that is far from bloated or boring), ""Wakefield"" will truly be a treat. I'd even put it ahead of the previously- mentioned ""American Beauty"" for its ability to portray a sort of treatise on the monotony of suburban existence, and one man's opportunity to ""escape"" it."
" Enlightened but irresponsible
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,6,"Yes, as others commented, the movie is superbly done and Cranston is as always a fantastic actor. The problem I had with this movie and its premise is the same I have whenever people introvert and wander into themselves and leave their surroundings: it may be sometimes healthy and prove certain independence but it is totally self-absorbed and selfish. Howard Wakefield may be ""cool"" by freeing himself from all his suburban self but he still depends on his house and its leftovers, he becomes a parasite where he once was a provider. And there is no consideration at all for the pain he may have caused those around him. This is the problem I have with his withdrawal... And when he returns he expects to be welcomed as a hero, when, in my mind, he betrayed and abandoned his loved ones."

But at the end it leaves you hanging, he just walks back in says hey Im home and thats it. What story did he come up with? He has been gone almost a year, and you are left with, hey Im home. Don't even get to know their reactions to him walking in the door. I guess with any movie you are left with a few lingering things but that bugs me a lot what story did he tell for him to be gone so long? Of course I can make up my own ending and my own story of what he would say, but I want to know what Howard told them. I don't even care so much if he stays with them or not or their reactions I just want the story lol Besides the slam on the brakes ending though it was a nice little trip with Howard, even though you don't go anywhere."
" ""I never left my family. I just left myself.""
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,8,"""Wakefield"" (2016 release; 106 min.) brings the story of Howard Wakefield. As the movie opens, we see Wakefield taking the train from Grand Central back to his house in the suburbs. The area is hit by by power outage and he ends up having to walk the last part. Along the way, we get to understand that he is quite unhappy with his life as a high stakes litigator and a marriage that is less than satisfying. When he gets home, on a whim he ends up spending the night in the attic room over the garage, and before we know it, he decides to go off the grid entirely. He ends up observing as his wife is frantically looking for him. At this point we're not even 15 min. into the movie. What will become of Howard? Will he resurface? To tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from writer-director Robin Swicord (best known for ""Memoirs of a Geisha"" a few years ago). Here she brings E.L> Doctorow's short story to the big screen. I have not read the short story, so I can't comment how close the movie adaptation sticks to the original story. Regardless, the key concept (a guy goes ""off the grid"", and then some) is an interesting one. Why didn't he simple tell his wife he wanted a divorce? The movie stands or falls entirely on the acting performance by Bryan Cranston in the role of Howard Wakefield. He is in virtually every frame of the movie, and provides the voice over as he shares his thoughts with us as to what is playing out. Cranston is nothing short of brilliant, in my humble opinion. Jennifer Garner plays his wife Diana, and has a very delicate task as we watch her (through Howard's eyes) from across the house but we rarely hear her talking (Cranston instead provides the ""play-by-play""). The fist part of the movie is outright hilarious and I found myself laughing out loud a lot (as did the rest of the theater audience)> The second half of the movie becomes a lot more introspective, as Wakefield deals with loneliness and realizes the long-term consequences of what he has done/is doing, in particular thinking of his 13 yr. old twin daughters. Observes Wakefield: ""I never left my family. I just left myself."" And check out the final moments of the movie... (mustn't say more!).""Wakefield premiered last Fall at several film festival to good critical acclaim but for whatever reason has not gotten a major push. It was released in a handful of theaters just last week, and I caught it at the Landmark E Street Cinema in Washington DC. The Friday evening screening where I saw it at was attended nicely. If you are in the mood for a family and relationship drama that is off- center and features a brilliant acting performance, by all means check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray."
" Here's looking at you (and me)
",2017-05-17 00:00:00,7,"Greetings again from the darkness. Oscar nominated for her screenplay to The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008), Robin Swicord's directorial debut of The Jane Austen Book Club (2007) was not particularly impressive. However, she bounces back nicely with this Bryan Cranston vehicle and one of the more creative scripts featuring internal dialogue that's ever hit the silver screen. Cranston is showing a knack for selecting interesting projects, and he excels here as the high-powered attorney who spontaneously decides to drop out of society in a most unusual manner.There is a ton of social commentary on display here with targets including married life, suburban living, career pressures, and self-doubt  substantially summed up with a line from Cranston's character, ""Most everyone has had the impulse to put their life on hold."" As he proceeds through his new 'unshackled' and 'primal' lifestyle while observing the world unnoticed through the small window in his garage attic, much of his focus seems to be on discovering just who he is at his core, and what is the truth behind his relationship with his wife (Jennifer Garner). It's as if he is asking ""What am I?"" while clinging to his previous life in a voyeuristic way.Ms. Swicord's screenplay is adapted from E.L. Doctorow's short story and it's sneaky in the way that it questions how we go about our daily life, and how one can ""snap"" emotionally if feeling unappreciated. It's a showcase for the other side of upper middle class white privilege, as well as suburban alienation that is so prevalent (and ignored) today. By dropping out but staying close, Cranston's character actually pays more attention to his family than he usually would if sitting next to them at the dinner table.We are accustomed to a mid-life crisis involving a sports car, marital affair or sudden career change. It's highly unusual for someone to actually ""disappear"". It's at that point where the narration really shines  it's insightful, observational and thought-provoking. Beyond that, the comedic edge is laden with sadness. The story humanizes this pretty despicable guy – or at least a guy who does a pretty despicable thing. The score is in the style of a 1980's Brian DePalma movie, which just adds to the unique cinematic experience. This is one to see for Cranston's performance, as well as for Ms. Swicord's commentary on today's way of life."
" Brilliant Performance by Bryan Cranston
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching Bryan Cranston's character devolve, much as his character in Breaking Bad did. He does a wonderful job showing us what made his character do what he did. Jennifer Garner is great as his wife. Beverly D'Angelo is amusing as Jennifer Garner's mother. There are dark moments, but also periods of levity. Bryan Cranston has to carry the majority of the film as we see everything through his eyes or as he interprets it. It is a unique way to show a person as they go through a possible break down. Who among us hasn't wanted to walk away from our life at some point? And haven't we wondered if we'd be missed and by whom? A must see film!"
