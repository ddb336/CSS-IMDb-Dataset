" Solid for what it is
",2021-04-12 00:00:00,7,"As far as horror comedies go, it is a delightful way to spend and hour and a half. Better in terms of acting and filmography. Some lines are corny and I had to cover my eyes because some of the gore was too much for me, but overall a solid child zombie movie."
" HIGHLY UNDERRATED!
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,9,"I'm so glad I took a chance and watched this despite the minimal IMDB score. This movie is hilarious! We laughed all the way through from beginning to end! It had a ""Shaun of the Dead"" feel to it! Excellent cast with off the wall comedy and Rainn Wilson killed it!!!"
" Fear the kids
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,9,"Steve's Horror Nights #2I decided to watch Cooties because zombies? Kids? Bro that sounds awesome! Did it live up to my expectations? Not really, but it does get a pass! This film focuses more on comedy than horror and it shows for sure! I love horror comedies! The intro was gross but I guess that's what this film wanted. I also like the characters! Why does it get a 9 and not a 10? Not enough Jorge Garcia."
" Garbage...
",2021-03-27 00:00:00,1,The trailer is waaaay better than the movie. The script is really stupid and the acting sucks. It's a huge waste of time. A zombie can write a better script. Amazon Prime is full of garbage movies that it got for free.
" Fun and lots of gore!
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,7,"These movie was very funny, I really enjoy some of the jokes, the only thing that make me awkward was all the gore from part of the children that were some series fore and with kids included so a accepted that that was the point of the movie but it was just a lot."
" Starts slow, but great once bodies start dropping
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,7,"Part comedy, part, spoof, part horror, but ultimately I take it as satire, and satire which tends more towards the cerebral than superficial, isn't for everyone. It is also fairly gory, and while many movies don't cross the line of violence against kids, this one has no such compunction.Overall, I think the zombie-like children eating their teachers is an interesting take on the genre. The setup starts out a little slow, but once the bodies start dropping it moves pretty quickly. That sort of fast paced, chaotic comedy isn't easy to pull off, but I think they did a really good job. I love some of the one-liners they throw in, like the ""follow me, I do Crossfit"" guy.There are also some legitimate creepy horror moments in the movie, including a delightful montage in the middle where teacher body parts are incorporated into playground equipment.It is not a perfect movie, though. There are numerous threads in the movie that seem random, or just don't go anywhere, and the ending feels abrupt, which overall makes the movie feel somewhat incomplete. Also, the Jorge Garcia character feels completely wasted..."
" Good horror comedy.
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,7,"A solid 7.5, almost an 8 but for the love triangle not being particularly funny or moving yet taking up a big chunk of the screen-time despite that fact. It's also a little more comedy than horror, though there are a few nail-biting sequences and a lot of gross scenes. You get the sense that an actual middle school teacher may have written this. The film has the ring of authenticity in certain aspects of these characters' day to day, which is effectively satirized. The set up is this: a nasty virus has tainted a company's chicken nuggets, but the chicken nuggets have already been distributed to cafeterias around the region before the recall was put in effect. The kids who eat the tainted nuggets become flesh eating zombies, and the kids who are bitten or scratched also become flesh eating zombies. Mysteriously, the adults only get gastroenteritis -- that's if they survive the attack, because these zombie kids don't play. There's a lot of gore here. The rest of the movie is them trying to escape the school while surrounded by the giggling undead, and when they finally do escape the school, it's still not over. Mad props for getting so many funny actors to work in this film, their line delivery sends the funny bits over the top. It is kind of hard to take the more dramatic bits seriously though, which means you just don't get as emotionally invested in the characters. It's still a fun ride and a good tie-breaker on movie night."
" Dual rear wheel
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,6,"Fun take on zombies. As a teacher this one is especially funny,, and a lil scary, lol."
" ""Oh look carnage"" such a great line
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,9,"Very wild unorthodox stylishly filmed gem of a good time! Should be considered a cult classic if it's not already praised by a following, Cooties is easy to love especially to me. The cast is impeccable for this especially Rainn Wilson, Elijah Wood, Leigh Whannel and Alison Pill; I love all these people! I feel like I want to own this movie at least it's available to stream."
" A weak setup but gradually finds its footing and a satisfying payoff
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,6,"Struggling author and reluctant substitute teacher Clint (Elijah Wood) takes a position at Fort Chicken Elementary School on the day a food borne virus turns the children into flesh eating zombies.Cooties is one of a number of genre titles from Elijah Wood's Spectrevision. Cooties is yet another zombie comedy following in the wake of Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland, and while it doesn't rank with the best in the subgenre, it's still a humorous and intense ride thanks to its great cast and solid direction.The movie doesn't make the best impression in its opening act as the movie sets up its characters as a menagerie of shrill stereotypes (jocks, religious nuts, etc.) and has an absolutely stomach churning opening tracking sequence where we follow a factory farmed chicken through the process of becoming a disease carrying chicken nugget.Once the movie gains its footing about a half hour in, Cooties manages to get a better sense of balance and execution in its horror and comedy. Rainn Wilson is particularly good in his role as what on first glance is a stock jerk jock character, but Wilson gives the character more depth than typically seen in this type of movie and makes the character more endearing.Cooties is a flawed movie, but it's also got some very entertaining elements thanks to a capable cast and sure handed direction."
" Adequate horror comedy
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,5,"Somewhat standard horror comedy, doesn't really add much the group of films of this ilk. Too standard characters lean toward the annoying rather than endearing. The script seemed under developed leaving the gruesome elements at odds with the humorous attempts. Okay film good production quality, but it doesn't come together as a whole."
" Really liked it
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,9,"So, it was really good! It had lots of gore but humorous too."
" Delightful horror comedy
",2020-08-24 00:00:00,7,Elijah woods plays a writer returning to his home town and home school as a substitute teacher. Some great character performances and school scenes in this great indie horror comedy. Hitachi steals the show.
" Good concept, bad film
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,2,"Painfully unfunny and predictable, however I think the concept could MAYBE work if done right. The only quality this had was how bad it was."
" Not a very good horror comedy, but a pretty entertaining movie...
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,8,"So I watched this movie for the second time today because it had been a year or two since I'd watched it and I wanted to make sure that my review was accurate to my current opinion, which is that this movie was fine, but it wasn't as good as I remember.Now that opening scene was disgusting, I looked at the screen the whole time but I was feeling sick to my stomach. One of the things I remember from the first time I watched it was that I had chicken nuggets for dinner while I was watching the movie, so I was lucky that I watched this early so that I didn't have to worry about dinner, or even lunch. Even though I found this part gross, it's probably one of the most effective opening scenes I've watched in a while. It didn't need any fast paced action or a bunch of death like most zombie movies do, all they needed was to show something gross. It's simple yet effective. I think I'll have to add a star for that.So anyway I think this movie had a great cast and I was surprised how well all of the weird characters worked together. I wasn't expecting to like all of the characters, but besides the main character, everyone else is somewhere in between okay and great.Now the child zombies thing I think is done really nice and it makes sense to have children zombies because it's an elementary school. They have decent make up and there is some good gore. But, like how there is very little action, there isn't much gore either. Surprisingly both the gore and the action, I personally think, worked better with less of it. Because some of my least favorite zombie movies either over do the gore (like Zombie Hood (2013)) or make the movie more action-oriented than horror (World War Z (2013)), which makes them hard to watch or hard to pay attention to.I don't really thing this movie is scary, and it's not very funny, but I still think it's a good movie. I honestly think that I'm not as harsh because they tried to mix 3 different genres, and fail to do so, yet they still make a movie that I'll watch all the way through and not even think of turning off (like I do with most movies, but I force myself to watch them.)Overall, this movie isn't the funniest, isn't the goriest, isn't the most action packed in the world. But it's entertaining, and it makes you think twice before you eat a chicken nugget. I literally have to examine every chicken nugget I eat nowadays. Lastly, have a nice day/night and thank you for reading. This movie gets an 8/10."
" A lot if fun, don't take it seriously
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,7,"Cooties is a fun-filled action packed zombie spoof. And to make matters worse (or more fun), the zombies are kids. This allows for much fun and conversation as while trying to kill our heroes, they are still...well...kids after all. The lines do get blurred at times though as to what is an acceptable thing to do to a child and there is some slight concern over this, but ultimately the slapstick humour doesn't make anyone dwell on this subject.We open to a chicken farm which is not terribly hygienic even by the lowest standards. In fact quite frankly the place looks like it needs shutting down. Some of this chicken happens to be infected and yup you guessed it, it eventually makes its way to the local community, specifically to the school. All it would take would be for one sweet, innocent child to eat it...and well you can figure out where all this going I'm sure.Frodo..or Clint in this case (Wood) is starting his first day as a substitute teacher at the said local school. We later find out he went to the very same school as a pupil years ago. This seems to be run by the trippy hippy vice principal Simms. The school is filled with an odd assortment of teachers, including Clint's old flame Lucy (Pill). Unfortunately her new boyfriend Wade (brilliantly over-played by Wilson) also teaches there. Throw in a stoner crossing guard and you get the general idea. Word! Naturally it doesn't take long for the kids to start snacking on their peers during lunch break.This is an incredibly silly, tongue-in-cheek and completely politically incorrect film with lots of references to other films. There are some simply stunning one-liners littered throughout and overall the script is pretty good and keeps you chuckling along. The effects are also reasonably good here and everyone acts well enough to be believable. Production values as a whole are high and there is not really much to gripe about at all. If anything it would be the open ending, but you'd be clutching at straws to really call it a fault.Overall this is a cracking little horror/comedy with a fantastic cast. With nods to how we consume food and what you can and can not get away with when it comes dispatching with the little annoying small people in your life, when taken as a fun, not so serious flick where you leave your brain at the door then this hits all the right spots. Highly recommended for fans of this genre.The Sage's Rating: 7/10"
" Parody? Not really.
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,6,"This film is supposed to be a parody. But as it often happens - the intention is far from realization, especially with horror genre. In fact it is more or less descent zombie film with gigs which may look funny but not much. Elijah Wood is not in his best role and does what has to be done but this isn't enough to give a spark to the film. Overall - if you are fan of zombie or contagion films, like me - you can give it a try. Otherwise - better skip it."
" Funny and Original.
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,7,"Review:
'Cooties' is an American horror comedy film directed by Jonathan Milott and Cary Murnion. The movie knows exactly what it wants to be and what it wants to achieve, and it does both from beginning to end.
After some chicken nuggets are infected with a virus that only infects pre-pubescent kids gets shipped to a middle school Fort Chicken, Illinois makes kids turn violent against adults. A group of teachers in the school must band together to escape or die the rest of there co-workers.
Being a comedic horror film, I thought it was fantastically cast. Elijah Wood and Alison Pill take the reigns and lead us through this funny adventure, and both do a great job. Leigh Whannell plays an outcast who really doesn't understand social interactions. This makes for funny interactions between his character and the other teachers. The standout for me must be Rainn Wilson as the gym teacher. His potty mouth and quick witty humor really made this movie be able to be called a 'comedy'. He steals every scene he was in and never apologises for it.
While this movie is the type that you can't take seriously, it does come to be almost mocking its audience at time with having to over explain scenes. Elijah Woods character needs to leave the group in order to retrieve something that will help them out of the situation they are in, and instead of having faith that we would know what they're talking about they feed it to us on a silver plater. I wish more movies had faith that their audiences actually like to figure things out or understand what they are saying. That is really my only complaint about the movie. It was smart on it's execution, it knew what story it was telling and it combined horror and comedy perfectly.
Overall, this movie is a prime example why us regular movie lovers can't trust 'Rotten Tomatoes' or 'IMDb' critics. They always bash original film such as this and it makes it so more won't get made. If you enjoy witty humor with some at times very graphic imagery than this movie is for you.
3.5/5"
" Worth every second!
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,10,An amazing cast with fantastic acting! Great gore and comedically action packed! I cannot understand why this doesn't have a higher rating! I will definitely watch this again and again!
" Sick script comes from sick writer
",2019-09-18 00:00:00,1,"What a disgusting movie that show many children killed
What was going on in your brain when you get this idea of a movie
Also only mentally ill actors agree to appear in such horrible movie"
" Monster
",2019-09-03 00:00:00,1,Why would you make movie like this do people have no morals. As I lose faith in humanity a other reason why. Your all are monsters.
" Honestly... Couldn't even finish it.
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,3,"If you want a funny horror movie, go watchTucker & Dale vs. Evil on Netflix. I've honestly watched it like 3 or 4 times. WAY better than this terrible movie.This movie is a complete waste of time. I gave it an honest effort. Got maybe 50% of the way through and just couldn't take it any more."
" my notes
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,1,This movie lost me pretty early on. the funny parts weren't funny and the rest of it was very typical of these kinds of movies. half-watched the second half (1 viewing)
" A Perfect Blend of Horror & Comedy
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,8,"Cooties is truly a horror and a comedy. The blend of these two genres is seamless and works perfectly. Every moment and character is hilarious, but there's also some really cool horror elements (lots of gore and violence).The ensemble cast all shine; no one lets the team down. None of the jokes fall flat. They are all very funny. The script is brilliant.The makeup and effects are all great too with the cootie-infected kids looking absolutely revolting and frightening.Cooties succeeds at both amusing and scaring. You will cringe at the graphic imagery as well as laugh out loud at the numerous well played jokes. Highly recommend this for anyone who loves horror but also enjoys comedy.If you can get through watching the opening sequence you're in for a real treat."
" Fun for the whole family!!!
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,8,"Zombies-good. Kid zombies-hilarious! This movie is campy and fun. It is a great entry into the zombie genre. It has a good ensemble cast that actually work well off each other. Good for a horromedy fan and for zombie fans alike.When a bad batch of chicken nuggets makes it to a school, it turns the kids that ate them into flesh eating monsters.The cast here comprised of Elijah Wood, Rainn Wilson Alison Pill and Jorge Gracia all work very well together as they try to come up with an escape plan. The town is lucky in that the school is completely gate off, but the faculty is not lucky in that they are trapped within the confines of the school and the surrounding grounds.This movie is an excellent balance of humor and gore."
" Super funny and entertaining
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,9,"Everyone has their own specific comedic taste. This was mine: politically incorrect, witty, dry, dark, and uncomfortable at times. Mix it up with great comedians/acting. Obviously the whole thing was a joke.
I thought it was a fairly original take on the whole zombie genre.
Worth a watch!"
" ""The Faculty"" played backwards
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,6,"Decent horror-spoof that resembles ""The Faculty"" in both plot and execution; the difference is that this time it's the students going apesh** instead of the teachers.It has a few memorable moments and a great cast. Catch this decent popcorn flick on HBONow."
" Lots of Laughs
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,8,Good humor along with some dark humor. Definitely a low budget film but worth a watch. I thought the plot was a little cheesy but none the less funny.
" Solid Horror Comedy
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,7,"This one is still a hell of a lot of fun. I'm not 100% sure I enjoyed it as much this time around as I did my first viewing, but it's still damn good. This one I think falls way more on the comedy side of things than the horror side, but it has some fun moments. The characters are overdone portrayals of people we all know. That's part of what makes it fun. The stereotypes are played to full effect in an unabashed way. That mixed with some overzealous tropes makes this a very easy to digest fun ride.The technical aspects of the film are well done and the acting is very good. If you like gore, there are actually some decent moments. While not too crazy, it's solid in that department.While the aforementioned overdone character portrayal is great and what makes the film work. It's also part of some of the more meh moments of the film. Some of it gets played out quick and becomes almost annoying. It far from ruins the film or anything, but I wish they would have reigned in some of those aspects just a little bit.If you like good horror comedy this is one to check out. This is the type of film you can appreciate as a horror lover, but I think non-horror lovers could appreciate as well.My Rating: 6.5/10"
" Chicken nugget, anyone?
",2018-09-06 00:00:00,6,"Apart from the undoubtedly very comforting sum of money on his bank account, it must really suck being Elijah Wood! Whatever you do or try, you'll always be referred to as that Hobbit from ""Lord of the Rings"" and typecast as a dork. This isn't intended as an insult or mockery, mind you, as I really like Elijah Wood and appreciate most of the roles he played (except for LotR). Since his recent attempts at mature and serious horror (""Open Windows"" and the heavily underrated ""Maniac"" remake) weren't exactly successful, it perhaps was a good idea for Wood to return to a horror-comedy reminiscent to one of his very first commercial hits. Indeed, ""Cooties"" reminds you of ""The Faculty"", except that Wood is now a wimpy (substitute) teacher instead of a wimpy student, and the alien monsters have been replaced with zombie toddlers! ""Cooties"" is admittedly a very unoriginal and derivative zombie-virus flick, but at least it's unpretentious and straightforward, without too many underlying messages or metaphors. Taking place in the aptly named community of Fort Chicken in Illinois, the film doesn't waste too much time, neither, as we witness during the fun opening credit sequences how diseased chicken flesh gets processed into nuggets and then consumed by an innocent little girl in the school cafeteria. The next day, aspiring but troubled writer Clint Hadson starts his job as a substitute teacher, but by the first recess time, he and a bunch of crazed colleagues already must run and hide from a horde of unhinged zombie children. Kudos to scriptwriter (and co-star) Leigh Whannell, who proves with ""Cooties"" that he's also capable of writing light-headed genre films, next to his regular scary and nasty stuff like ""Saw"", ""Insidious"" and ""The Conjuring"". Whannell's role as the socially awkward biology teacher is also one of the funniest, while Rainn Wilson is terrific as the stereotypical gym teacher: a dumb macho, slightly overweight and sporting a ridiculous moustache. Two-thirds of ""Cooties"" is good entertainment, especially for as long as the teachers are entrenched inside the school while the creepy kids linger around; - using eyeballs as marbles or human intestines as skipping rope. The last 10-15 minutes seem somewhat unstructured and rushed, and the script even makes some irritating rookie-horror mistakes, like the sudden return of characters who were supposed to be dead. If I had watched ""Cooties"" after a day of bad temper, perhaps I would have been less positive and labeled it as another umpteenth and unnecessary zombie comedy, but today it provided me with a few genuine laughs and a good hour and a half of entertainment."
" Not sure who this is for, it's ok?
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,6,"Not that funny, but kinda sometimes, feels longer than the runtime of only 88 mins, and a lot of fine actors, but their chops certainly don't show in this one"
" Disturbing misfire at a horror/comedy
",2018-07-29 00:00:00,1,"""Cooties"" could have been amazing but instead it is not. The plot is simple enough but somehow the action and dialog aren't sharp or funny and the actors seem as if they are working per diem, with one exception. Rainn Wilson is the only actor who makes an attempt to inhabit his character fully.It would also have helped if the story had been consistent. If the the children's brains were undergoing necrosis, their thinking ability should have been nonexistent. Instead, the second child to be infected is shown destroying cell phones and turning off the school's electricity, as if he is intending to keep the adults in a vulnerable state. Movie zombies don't do this (at least, none that I've seen).Lastly, the frequent and violent scenes where zombie children are killed make this film uncomfortable to watch. It is irrelevant that they are supposed to be zombies. The killing or injuring of any child is NOT entertainment."
" Teachers deserve respect
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,6,"Delightful and funny! There's nothing very original in this comedy but that's what it makes it so pleasant to watch. It's a zombie movie with children and people who are not afraid of them... Teacher deserves indeed all of our respect! It's really great written and directed. There's some length that a great editing makes forget. If you want to have fun, you're in the right place with this movie."
" TEACHING IS THE HARDEST JOB IN THE WORLD
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,10,"Clint (Elijah Wood) goes to his old school, Fort Chicken elementary school, Illinois (GO FIGHTING ROOSTERS!) as a substitute teacher. He meets Lucy (Alison Pill) an old friend who has trouble with normal conversations. Her boyfriend is the PE teacher Wade (Rainn Wilson) who owns a truck with duo rear wheels. The film introduces us to a number of quirky characters and kids that are not that adorable. Due to a viral breakout caused by processed chicken nuggets (I tossed mine out after seeing how nuggets are made from pink paste) the children turn into blood thirsty zombies who attack in hordes with some limited mental capacities.The film spoofs formula writing: dress up montage; guy who is way too smart; self-sacrifice individual; climbing through the vent duct; and a reference to a previous film...""Sneak around like a little Hobbit.""This is a funny zombie style cult film.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" The opening credits were a little too much
",2018-04-09 00:00:00,7,"To start with, the movie has great laughs and great gore. I loved all the cheeky bits with the children playing with remains. In fact, if there was one thing I didn't like about this movie, it's the opening credits.
Without going too far into detail, we're shown chickens being processed and made into chicken nuggets. And those who know what happens during processing would know how disturbing that is (especially if you're an animal lover like me). 
I mean, couldn't they just show the already-processed chicken being made into chicken nuggets? As long as you see the one black nugget, then it would probably work fine too.
To be honest, the opening credits really took me out of the mood of even seeing the movie (and if I'm being completely honest, the only reason I wanted to watch it was because of Leigh Whannell being in it *he was hilarious*). 
The opening credits are something a malicious vegan would show to someone if they wanted to make them vegan. It freaked me out so much that I can't go to sleep without my TV on.
Anyway, overall, the movie was a good mix of funny and gory, but be sure you can handle seeing chickens being processed."
" Its Not Good And Its Not Bad Either

" Back to School
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,7,"Working as a relief teacher at his old primary school proves unexpectedly challenging for an aspiring writer when a viral disease turns the students into zombie-like creatures in this amusing horror- comedy. While there is a lot of interest in the notion of adults having to kill children to survive, 'Cooties' is actually at its best in the moments before it turns into a full-blown horror film. The awkwardness of working in a new school, the insolence of unmotivated students and the overzealous nature of certain staff members are acutely captured and placed under a sharp satirical hammer. The story has highly metaphorical qualities too, almost existing as a manifestation of all of the protagonist's fears and anxieties about returning to his home town and feeling like he is going backwards by going back to primary school. There is an especially memorable dialogue exchange where he expresses jealousy towards his first grade students with their lives all ahead of them. As 'Cooties' plods on though, this satirical edge soon becomes second to the bloodshed and gore with the film often feeling like a standard zombie plague flick in its second half. There is, however, a really solid climax with deliriously multi-coloured lights and the pseudoscience regarding the plague is always interesting with a health teacher who hilariously finds the plague more medically fascinating than scary."
" I love it!
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,8,"Cooties (2014) is a comedy horror film from the United States. Directed by Carly Munion and Jonathan Millot, the screenplay was written by Ian Brenan and Leigh Whannel, the film was first released on 18 January 2014 at the Sundance Film Festival. Telling about a strange virus outbreak that strikes a school, begins when a student eats a nasty nugget that gives off a disgusting black liquid. Instantly the child infected all the people in that school .. The surviving teachers, had to endure from their pupils who had turned into bloodthirsty Zombies .. About Cooties (2014): this movie is very unique and funny, the characters in this movie is so silly and make a laugh, do not forget the funny dialogue dialogue that increasingly add to the furore this movie. The film is like having elements of Zombieland (2009). The storyline is quite unique .. The characters in this movie are so funny, weird and silly. I like this movie ..."
" Leigh Whannell can do Funny! Who knew?
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,8,"Cooties is yet another in the crop of zombie comedy movies. Thing is I'm a sucker for them, and judged by the trailer this definitely looked to be one of the better ones. I was not disappointed. It opens up with a montage of chicken nuggets being made, from the killing of the chicken all the way to the first bite, except this time it's infected and is enough to put you off chicken nuggets for life. Then we get introduced to Clint, an aspiring writer who's moved back to his sleepy little town from New York and is about to start his first day as a teaching sub at the local primary school.I found myself thoroughly enjoying the movie already, before the zombie infection had even broken out. While no new ground is particularly broken with the cast of characters, they're all a delight to watch. Clint is a positive guy despite being down on his luck, Wade is your typical jock come PE teacher with assholish tendencies, Rebekkah is tightly wound and maybe a little fanatical, Tracy is obviously trying to conceal his blatant homosexuality, Doug has no idea how to interact with real people, and Lucy is...well she's cutesy I guess; smiley, happy, giggly. She comes more into her own later on. While none of these character tropes are particularly new, the way they interact with one another, and the chemistry shared between the whole group, lends to a number of hilarious icebreaker moments, like Rebekkah pointing to her rape alarm when Clint introduces himself, or Wade's inability to pronounce 'dual rear wheel'.Thankfully the humour never really lets up, as it oozes into every moment, making Cooties more comedy than horror. Even in more serious moments, there's jokes squeezed in to lighten the mood and keep the tone more amusing than disturbing. And yet, and most crucially, none of the jokes feel forced. Each one flows naturally from the characters and moments they find themselves in. Often they come completely from the left-field and are funny out of sheer surprise (such as Doug using ""gloves"" to sift through bodily fluids). It's also hugely quotable, which in my opinion is one of the most enduring aspects for a comedy, as it keeps the hilarity going long after the credits have rolled. I've found myself quoting it all day today, and I foresee it getting quoted more over the next few days. ""Follow me, I do crossfit"" and ""You may have noticed I sometimes say the wrong rowboat"" are particular highlights.As I said though, Cooties ends up being more of a comedy than a horror movie, so if you're looking to it for scares, you will be disappointed. Me, I'm a wimp, so I welcomed the toned down horror. Even when the opportunity arises for a cheap jump-scare, they play it slower and less dramatically. Negative for some, but it made it more enjoyable for me personally. This is a zombie movie though, so there is a certain level of gore. A couple of characters get their guts ripped out, and there's a lot of kids covered in blood, but in-all it's fairly light on the gore scale, especially for a zombie movie.The cast are all great. While the characters are tired tropes, each one is made more enjoyable thanks to the acting talent behind it. Elijah Wood is charming as Clint, who is a character who could so easily have drifted into annoyance. Rainn Wilson steals every scene as Wade, with Leigh Whannell's Doug not far behind (seriously, who knew Leigh Whannell was actually funny?). Alison Pill is perfect as the cutesy Lucy who comes into her own later on, and Jorge Garcia enjoys looking stoned and confused throughout most the run time.There is one rather large criticism I have of Cooties though and that's the end. Or lack thereof as the case may be. The survivors manage to escape and leave the town only to reach the next town and find the pandemic is far more reaching than they expected. There's a little hint of finding a cure, but they just blow up a playgym and hightail out of there into the credits, with no resolution to any of the barebones character arcs, or the general story. It just sort of ends, and it feels like they didn't really know how to resolve anything, so just threw up the credits when they reached their allotted runtime. Maybe it was deliberate to leave the door open for a sequel, but it made the whole thing feel a little incomplete, like there was more to come that we just didn't get to see.In conclusion, Cooties is, for once, a very good thing to have experienced. It's truly hilarious and best and mildly amusing at worst. It's a little light on the horror and gore, so not recommended for that crowd, but for anyone just looking to have a good chuckle I couldn't recommend it enough. I give Cooties a solid 8/10."
" Chicken feed
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,2,"The best bit about Cooties is the title sequence as maggot infested chicken meat is processed and turned into chicken nuggets and consumed by a schoolgirl as school lunch.The only other bit the viewer might like depending on your mileage is schoolkids attacking and devouring the school teachers or alternatively teachers sadistically beating up the crazed infected kids.Elijah Wood has descended so much from his The Lord of the Rings days. He plays Clint a struggling author who has come back to live with his mom and substitutes as a teacher at the local school.At least he has a memorable first day as a mysterious virus grips the schoolkids turning them into blood crazed monsters as the teachers are trapped inside.Cooties is supposed to be a comedy horror but it is a poorly structured film, a lot of the action is in the dark in order to save on the budget. I found the teachers irritating and I was upset that the Wade character was not the first one to be ripped apart."
" Really enjoyed it!
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,6,"I actually really enjoyed this. I'm not a massive fan of Elijah Wood and it's not of the calibre of say, the Scary Movie series, but this was a good film.It may not have the best plot or a big budget, but it was quite funny. You certainly won't be bored watching it, it will certainly entertain you and that's the reason we watch films. Plenty of laughs and over the top cheesy gore that will make you say 'eww' whilst giggling.The opening scenes might be enough to turn some people vegetarian.I'm not sure why but the scene with the kid skipping with the intestines really made me howl.Certainly worth a watch and for the entertainment value, the price is a steal."
" Tasteless
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,6,"Cooties delivers an interesting opening scene, but then turns into silly nonsense that doesn't satisfy a lot horror fans, with forgettable characters and a story which no one will remember. At times it is funny and entertaining, but there are many movies that are way better than this Sci fi horror flick."
" Rebecca, quiet please...
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,6,"First I must say that oddly enough it has taken me 3 years to get around to watch ""Cooties"" for some reason. And that is strange when I do like anything even remotely zombie. I just never got around to watching it for some reason.The pacing of ""Cooties"" was actually surprisingly nice. The movie starts out well enough as it establishes some characters, but it quickly delves into the action and the stuff that us zombie aficionados crave and hunger for - pardon the pun.Storywise, then I only knew that it was about some kind of virus infecting children in a school, but aside from that then I had no idea of what to expect from directors Jonathan Milott and Cary Murnion. But I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of ""Cooties"".""Cooties"" had a good ensemble of acting talents on the cast list; a list which included really great performances by Elijah Wood and Rainn Wilson. Aside from them, then I was fairly unfamiliar with the rest of the cast. But people were doing great jobs with their given roles and characters.As for the characters, well then I have to say that the character gallery was quite colorful and each character was distinct and unique, easily standing out from the rest of the characters individually.It should be said that there isn't an abundance of gore, mayhem and mutilation in ""Cooties"", which works out well enough. There was some, of course, and it was enough to satisfy my cravings. And it was especially good because the special effects and make-up effects were well done and straight to the point.Now, ""Cooties"" doesn't really have the contents to become a classic within the zombie genre, nor did it really manage to separate itself from the herd. In that aspect, then it was a fairly bland and generic addition to the genre. Sure, the movie was enjoyable and watchable, just don't expect to be blown away."
" Brilliant setting, really funny horror comedy
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,8,"The setting of the movie is brilliant. There's always something creepy about zombie children. Yes, all zombies or infected or whatever is your preferred term for these horrifying creatures, are of course terrifying, but the children are even more so. It's like when children are singing in horror movies it's million times creepier. When ghosts are children, they are creepier. When any kind of monster in a horror movie is a kid, it's always like... yikes.The main characters are such a strange bunch, it's a delight. They are all such stereotypical teachers. There's that cheerful, happy teacher, grumpy coach, different kind of creepy teachers and that one sub who asks students to call him by his real name. They make a weird team of survivors, and they are freaking hilarious. Most of the humour comes from their archetypes, and of course the dialogue is amazing. It most often is in actually funny horror comedies. Cooties is funny and thrilling while it's also wonderfully disgusting. Also if the beginning of this movie won't make you a vegetarian, then nothing will."
" Good Movie, Bad Ending...
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,7,"Personally, I believe the plot of this movie was exceptional. I love horror movies and the movie was pretty good.Until the ending, where they don't even solve the virus. They just drive off, leaving all these blood-hungry children on the loose. I mean, at least find a cure or something?Other than that, it was pretty good. I would recommend it to a horror fan."
