" Riveting, beautifully filmed, genuinely thoughtful
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,10,"I watched this film on Amazon shortly after finishing Soldaten, a summary and assessment of reports of German war crimes from secret recordings made of German POWs.As a movie viewer, the film is riveting. It manages to show how the incredibly dangerous work of mine clearance can seem to settle into routine and then brutally reminds you how dangerous it really is. It is also beautifully filmed, with long pans of the beach and (as another review pointed out) no soundtrack. All you hear is the wind, the waves, and the voices, which makes the focus on what the young soldiers are doing even sharper and the detonations more shocking because there is no music build up: they just happen. As a drama, it is simply one of the best and most finely crafted films I've seen in many years. And it was done in only about two months of filming, which is a testimony to Zandvliet's skill as a writer and director.Most importantly, the film is one of the most thoughtful I have seen by pointing out how victims can easily become victimizers. Believe me, after finishing Soldaten, I have no sympathy for the Germans. But that book shows indelibly how the Germans felt justified in committing many atrocities precisely because they saw themselves as the victims of ""Jewish conspiracy"" or the nations around them. In this film, it is is clear that the Danish characters feel the same way towards the Germans, if not (obviously) justifying the same degree of cruelty. An important element I haven't seen commented upon elsewhere is that the young Germans earn the respect of the Danish sergeant, despite how ambiguous his relationship with them remains throughout the film. As he tells the de facto leader of the group to help him regain his composure when he is on the verge a breakdown, ""Be a man."" If we wish not to be victimizers (as well as victims) we need not only sympathy or empathy, we need to recognize the worth of people even when they are our opponents. There is no Hollywood sentimentality here, but much truth."
" A wild movie
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,8,"I have seen some comparisons to hurt locker. Personally hurt locker was too slow for me, almost boring. I like on the edge, action. This movie did not fall short. From the start I was into it, and enjoyed the characters and the interaction they had. Highly recommend. Only wish the dog would of lived haha."
" Really potent exposé of war after the war...
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,7,"We start with a map of post WWII Denmark illustrating the hundreds of miles of coastline onto which the Nazis had buried hundreds of thousands of land mines. ""Lt. Ebbe Jensen"" (Mikkel Boe Følsgaard) details his hard as nails sergeant ""Carl"" (Roland Møller) to manage a group of teenage German POWs whose job it will be to learn the skills of bomb disposal in a matter of days, and to then set about clearing these lethal devices from the sands. The boys - for they are really little more than boys - are terrified, malnourished and probably no more Nazi than their guard - but his hatred fuels his tough, relentless regime that sees the youngsters' number gradually dwindle. The lads have spirit, though, and as they begin to work together he begins to have some respect for them; appreciates their predicament a little more and... It's quite an interesting film to watch. Møller is superb as the bullying sergeant and the juxtapositioning of the enemy (ostensibly the Nazis) with the Danes (previously the occupied) brings that old expression ""two wrongs don't make a right..."" come to mind. Louis Hofmann (""Sebastian"") and Oskar Berton (""Werber"") stand out amongst the excellent ensemble of actors who portray the terrified prisoners, their bond and intimately their own sense of integrity is frankly quite touching. Maybe just a little too much enthusiasm with the drone camera; but it is also a good looking film with plenty of attention to the detail and Danish auteur Martin Zandvliet doesn't flinch from depicting his own countrymen as boorish at best, brutal at worst. It's also probably fair to say he is the only director ever to have one sympathise with Nazis. I liked the ending, it worked well without being too sentimental and I'd highly recommend this film - on a big screen, if you can."
" Excellent and horrific War Movie.
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,8,I did not know that Denmark committed any war crimes but when they did this one it is horrific.....This movie is just excellent well acted and directed your at the edge of your seat in many parts of this movie it is a bit predictable otherwise a very enjoyable watch I highly recommend this picture.
" Most beautiful yet horrifying movie
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,9,"I truly can't believe this movie hasn't won any Oscars. First time I watched the movie was 2 years ago, and it is still one of my favourites. I have watched it at least 5 times and I'm still as amazed as first time I saw it. Pure magic. Incredible pictures. Such a beautiful yet horrifying story. The script is on point. Actors are amazing. You really get the feeling of knowing each and every one of the characters from the movie. Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. I just can't get enough.9/10, but that's just because I rarely rate a movie 10/10. Truly worth a view. (I would recommend seeing this movie twice)"
" A poignant film on the aftermath of war
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,9,"Well acted unusual take on post war regeneration. Touching, barbaric , unexpected suspenseful viewing .....good wins through for the few who dare to hope .
Worth watching this for the great acting and storyline sensitively handled ."
" An other face to world war2!
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,8,"A Great work, An other face to world war2! I really interesting in it"
" Land of mine
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,10,"Possibly the best war film i have ever watched but Also extremely brutal.
I recommend this for anyone over 15 but keep in mind it is Very brutal."
" Good film
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,8,"In addition to expressing people's dissatisfaction with the war through the hatred of the Local Danes towards the German army, the young Germans are also eager to return to peace and rebuild their homeland. This was fully demonstrated in their many private conversations. To return to the motherland became their urgent desire after the completion of the mission. So, another theme conveyed by the film is human nature, which is embodied in master Sergeant Carl's changing attitude towards the young Germans. At the end of the film, Carl secretly lets four survivors go, showing the humanity of the film incitingly, and a warm current gushes into the heart. It was as if the war had never happened when we saw four teenagers running towards their homes five hundred metres away.In addition to expressing people's dissatisfaction with the war through the hatred of the Local Danes towards the German army, the young Germans are also eager to return to peace and rebuild their homeland.

" I am amazed and deeply moved after seeing this movie
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,9,"This movie has the potential to bring tear to your eyes and it does. This was an untold story and unknown to me, it tells us something really horrible that happened with German POWs after World War II. Some two thousand German Prisoners of war, mostly very young teens were asked to clean the beaches of Denmark that had mines buried inside the sands of the beaches by Nazi Germany's Army. History says that around 2000 young Germans diffused 1.5 million mines. This movie shows the plight of those young age German Soldiers who were treated inhumanly and were given this uphill task in which many people lost their lives and if not lives then their arms or limbs.This movie deserved an Oscar and it did get nominated too but could not win. However it earned many awards in many major film festivals and ceremonies that it rightly deserves.It is a brilliant movie with fantastic performances from lead actors. I came to know about this movie because of Louis Hofmann the lead actor of popular Web Series Dark. I was skeptical if I would like this movie or not still I watched it because the subject was different and it had Hoffman in it, but after seeing I think these are petty small reasons. This movie connects with you emotionally and you feel pity for those young soldiers who were given this dangerous task in inhuman conditions.It does not have any war scenes, so if you are exclusively looking for combat scenes then this movie has none, but nonetheless it's a wonderful movie and a must watch"
" The horrible plight of German prisoners of war after the war - in Denmark
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,10,"This is a gripping drama and true story from Denmark after the war, showing part of the outrageous treatment of German prisoners on the part of Denmark, when 1000 prisoners were used to clean the beaches of 1,2 million land mines, mostly youngsters, half of them perishing in the process. The film is expertly made, showing both brutal realism and delicate empathy in the sinister plight of the German boys and their sheriff sergeant Rasmussen (Roland Moller in an unforgettable role). The realism is admirably consistent in its unflinching almost documentary rendering of a reality that couldn't have been more devilish in its constant mortal danger and unbearable tension - tragedies are inevitable, and suicidal tendencies unavoidable. It's a shocking film but at the same time overwhelmingly beautiful and with a human touch that in spite of all must remain the lasting impression of this uniquely rare, precious and important film, that could be seen as a vital excuse 70 years afterwards for what tragically and most regrettably occurred."
" HEARTBREAKING.
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,8,The movie makes you sympathetic towards the young kids recruited as soldiers for Nazi Germany. Even from small screen it sent me through a journey of dispair and hopelessness. Beautifully made.
" The Battle for Death
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,8,"Before I review this film, I express my feelings about this terrible battle, a battle that wiped out many innocent people from this world... for nothing... The film only expressed the feelings of fourteen boys, showed their dreams, showed their childish fears; and in the end, it turned out that they were just a small group of this tragedy. Soundtrack and everything is very professionally made. I highly recommend watching this movie."
" Great (Post)War Piece
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,8,"If you watch those war and post-war movies produced in Europe in recent years (e.g. 1944, Tuntematon sotilas, The 12th Man, Into the White, Der Hauptmann to name a few) you come to realize how stereotyped most Hollywood movies on WWI and WWII are and hide that aspect behind lots of explosions and special effects and a big budget and gum chewing ueber-heroes. Under sandet (Under the Sand) is no big production but it got a suspenseful story, a well acting cast, and tells us a story of a small and mostly forgotten part of history. A top-notch (post)war drama with some real thrilling moments and maybe as realistic as a movie can be."
" One of the best modern war films about WW2.
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,10,Just watch it. If you don't cry through this movie then you should not be part of the human race.
" AN INTENSE STORY !!!!
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,10,"An obscure chapter related to the Second World War told with deep and crude realism. An underhand revenge from Denmark towards the defeated German army, young deportees forced to clean up the Danish beaches by my Nazi army. A handful of beardless soldiers armed with wood to hunt deadly my antitank with the dream of a return home and the fear of dying from a sudden explosion. Cured in detail and supported by a fine photograph, the product offers a realistic cross-section of war, yet another unknown piece of suffering finally brought to light by a film with marked historical educational hues."
" Post-war wounds were everywhere
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,8,"Post-war wounds were everywhere, and young life paid for it. The hatred of the Danes, and the innocence of the boys, could not be accused and unable to refute, but only helplessness and distress. May the world be peaceful and the sun and beach football last forever."
" A great danish movie
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,8,"This was a very well written and acted movie. The production level was very good and after viewing it, I don't think it was a very ex pensive movie to film. Yet it might be one of the best films I have seen from 2015. I really liked t he story line here. Post WWII with a real feel for the era. You had a very real sense that the anger these people were feeling was real. There are parts in the movie where you just had to think WOW it just got real. From the very beginning they were not going to hold back. You could really feel the emotional message of the movie. The movie is not for people who like happy endings. This is a very powerful story that sucks you in, and it holds you there in sus pense. It's like watching a train wreck. It's great entertainment but the outcome is simply horrifying as you know what is coming down the tracks. It is filled with anger, fear and dread. But also human connection, reflection, and the propensity for humans to know the moral right. There is no way you can look at this movie and say there is a ""happy ending"". Instead it gives you a real glimpse of the complexities of post WWII mechanics and human character. There is simply no way to look past the harsh realities of this film. It speaks to who we are and how human beings react. But it also shows that while we may not be innocent, we try to preserve others who we think are."
" A previously untalked about and mostly unknown story about post WWII Europe and the German soldier.
",2020-03-10 00:00:00,9,"The Nazis were evil scum....no sane person would deny this. And, considering all the evil they perpetrated, it's hard to feel too sorry about the fates of many German soldiers following the end of WWII....but this doesn't necessarily make their fates morally right. Most films never talk about the hundreds of thousands of Germans who were taken prisoner in Russia during the war and who mostly never returned home or, if they did, it was many years later. They also never talk about the SS soldiers who were starved to death because there wasn't much food after the war and the Allies thought if someone had to starve to death, it should be members of the SS. Well, along this same vein, ""Under Sandet"" (""Land of Mine"") talks about German soldiers who were forced to dispose of mines at the war's end. Many died in the process....and they had no choice but to do this or else. In each case, you can understand the decisions of the Allies...though it wasn't exactly the moral choice.The film begins with a Sergeant (I was uncertain if he was Danish or British) attacking a German prisoner after the war was over. While the victim was carrying a Nazi flag (so it was hard to feel too sorry for him), the attack was savage and rather unprovoked. Soon you realize this Sergeant is the same man who soon will be responsible for heading a unit made up of German prisoners of war who will be disarming the countless mines left behind by the German army. It's obvious he's an angry man and has little regard for the members of his unit. The irony is that how he initially treats these Germans reveals that he would have made a great Nazi himself! And, it's sad to watch his mistreatment of the 'men' because many look like teenage boys--forced into the German Army whether they liked it or not. These are not SS murderers...but people and the choice of actors to play these soldiers made this very apparent.So is the film worth seeing? Absolutely. Of course, however, you need to remember that with the subject matter the film is going to be bloody and depressing....and so it easily earns its R-rating. I don't know how you could have made the movie otherwise considering the subject matter. It was wonderfully constructed and seeing the Sergeant change and become more human was a wonderful thing about the movie. However, exactly how accurate it all is, well, even today there's a lot of debate and I read up on some articles that questioned whether or not the German conscripts were actually teens or more experienced soldiers. Regardless, it's well worth seeing and worth remembering. One of the better Danish films I've seen...which is incredible as Denmark has been quietly making some of the best movies over the last couple decades with little notice abroad."
" Unforgettable One!
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,10,"Land Of Mine War Rule number one: (under any circumstances you have to do what you are supposed to do), this was my first German movie, unforgettable Drama/History/War i really like how this represents all these genres, Are you ready to discover the story behind those retreated German soldiers?, representing the facts of how POWs were being treated after their countrys fall, superb acting from (Roland Møller) taking the general role and all other young POWs, viewing the human character changing from a strict personality to a merciful person, great great cinematography directing and sound track, having a calm feel able atmosphere, as i always say movies are more than what we watch its all about experiencing it so just go through others experience, it doesn't lack in any aspect, this is really a good lesson for everyone, no doubt it will be in my favourites, worthy for everything what it really is, highly recommended,10/10⭐"
" Here what I call a GREAT FILM
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,10,"1) Simple, yet an amazing story
2) Complex and realistic characters
3) Emotional
4) Engaging"
" Heart-stopping and the terrible truth of war.
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,9,"An incredible film, from a completely different perspective. Captured German, child soldiers, that are made to clear (1,000's of) mines off of Danish beaches. The story concerns a battle hardened Danish Sergeant, who hates them with a passion but the relationship blurs after a series of catastrophic events. It's not common knowledge but on the Western Front, post D.Day, two thirds of all German troops were actually Hitler Youth. Only kids and old men left to mop up. This is such a heart wrenching story of very young boys, caught up in the blackest point in human history. I'm glad so many of these type of stories are now surfacing and 'Land of Mine' is up there with the very finest 'Anti War' movies."
" Well acted & gripping but not factual
",2019-11-28 00:00:00,7,"Will keep this short.
The film kept me interested and involved . It's superbly acted . It shows the humanity of your enemy , not always the evil shown in most films but as very young boys forced to fight someone else's war. They've literally no clue what they are doing and are kids really .
Issue I have is the film is largely fabrication. Yes Germans were ordered to clear mines but Danish forces never ordered them to , the Sgt in the film is completely made up as are the main"
" A Fine Movie But.....
",2019-10-04 00:00:00,8,"This was a very well done and well acted movie. However, it is not entirely true.A German pioneer group that was named Minenkommando Dänemark and who was especially established to take care of the mine-clearing task by the allies did the mine-clearing task in Denmark. The Germans worked under German supervision and Danish control.There is no way that untrained boys using rudimentary and extremely dangerous methods could remove all of those mines. It also would not make any sense since there were vehicles (tanks with rotating chain flails mounted on the front) which were used to clear paths through minefields."
" not bad movie, worth to see it
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,8,"One of better films i have seen this year,...character are building nicely , acting war quite good also screenplay and directing.
Characters are complex and they dont copy it one to another. that makes this movie goodworth watching!"
" Brilliant and heart-wrenching
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,8,"An extremely well done, tense and heart-wrenching film about an element of WW2 history that is virtually unknown outside of Denmark. Similarly this film is relatively unknown, which is a real shame beacuse it is excellent.
This film is very sad, so be prepared for that going in.
Explosive Ordinance Disposal is a naturally suspense-filled and sad subject for film that has already being covered very well by 'Ten Seconds to Hell' 1959 and 'The Hurt Locker' 2008. In my opinion 'Last of mine' handles this subject extremely well - at least as well as The Hurt Locker which is one of my favourite films. All elements of the film are brutally realistic. This combines with the protagonists being child soldiers (realistic of late WW2 German armies) does a great job of encouraging the viewer to empathise with the German POWs - a rarity in the world of film. This encourages a more nuanced understanding of the war by showing the plight German victims of Nazism and the war it started as well as highlighting a shameful element of post-war history.
The film has excellent acting, set design/selection and historical authenticity (for the most part). The film is able to capitalise this still further through excellent cinematography of the stunning landscape. Aside from being so sad, this makes it truly a pleasure to watch.
The only thing that stops this film from being perfect is the predictability of elements of the plot - particularly the character arc of one of the leads. However, given how well made the film is, this does not detract much from the otherwise superb experience. One of my favourite modern war films."
" Deadly experience
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,8,"Devastating, Startling and Disturbing Look at The Aftermath of World War II, Truly one of the Best Danish Films i've seen in Recent Years, i highly recommend it."
" Historical facts are are almost complete gone in this movie
",2019-04-06 00:00:00,1,"Unfortunately the historical facts in this movie are as wrong as they can be. While it may be a well produced film with very good actors, it is a shame that we have to be filled with lies just to make the movie more interesting to watch.Apparently it is a trend to spice up movies with lies to make them more interesting, but it is a problem that people don't get the real historical facts and start to believe that such movies are factual."
" A Tense and Heartbreaking Drama About One of History's Least Known Chapters
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,9,"Land of Mine is an eye opening dramatization of one of the least known chapters of World War Two, in which German POWs, many still in their teens, were forced to clear millions of landmines from the Danish coast immediately after the war's end. Befitting its subject it's a well-crafted suspense drama, but more than that it's a masterful and deeply engaging work of emotional and moral nuance. It's not every war movie that can make viewers sympathize with the Germans.Looking back, we like to think of WWII as a good war, a triumph of good over evil. And not without reason. The Allied Powers saved Europe from the genocidal Nazi regime and Asia from the brutality of Imperial Japan. But no war is won without morally questionable acts. And forcing these men to clear millions of landmines was even more questionable because the war had already been won. Using the enemy to clear the mines their comrades had laid may have seemed an expedient solution, yet it smacks of vindictiveness and one can't shake the feeling that what we're seeing amount to a war crime.It's the deep ethical questions and personal drama that give the film its depth, but it's the suspense that holds the viewers' attention. We know that at any moment the slightest mistake could end one of these boys' lives. And of course it does, more than once. We dread the moment when the next boy will die, and it' absolutely devastating when it happens. Yet the movie never becomes too mournful, or lingers too long. Soon enough the tone is again tense, or hopeful, or occasionally even humorous.Just as the film- and the boys'- mood has its ups and downs, so does their relationship with the Danish sergeant placed in command of them (Roland Møller). It's naturally antagonistic at first. These Germans were members of the Nazi army occupying his country, and he is their jailer as much as their commander. He tells them repeatedly that he does not care if they are miserable or if they die, as long as the mines are cleared. And he means it, mostly.It's equally natural that his stance towards them will soften as he comes to see them as people rather than enemies. But this change is not inevitable or without stumbles. At one point he becomes so callous that one almost fears he will become the villain of his own story. It's fascinating watching his conflicting emotions, his struggle to balance his duty with his humanity.The result is a deeply poignant, intimate, and earnest film that reminds us that even our enemies are human and even the most seemingly clear cut conflicts aren't always as black and white as we would like to think. There are no easy answers or sense of closure here, but then the men involved never received any either."
" Extremely good movie 👍
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,9,"Danish movie about the aftermath of WW2
I can definitely recommend this movie 🍿👍👌"
" Great and touching movie. I highly recommend
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,7,"Great and touching movie about human relations and humanity.
It speaks about nazis young soldiers who were captured in Denmarek and were used like slaves to look for and extract mines along the coast of Denmark.
This movie brings something new that I have never seen before in cinema about nazis.
Young soldiers shall not suffer the consequences of wrong decisions of leaders and commanders and we are human after all.
Finally we can say that among those who won the war againt nazis, there were some who should have been judged for what they did to nazis hostages."
" Depressing, disturbing, horrors of war. True masterpiece
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,9,"The realism and it being so authentic made this WW2 movie stand out, Danish productions really makes great war movies as Invasion of Denmark was superb and this was also the same quality but a total different story, horrible/shameful events made into a depressing but developed into a more happy movie but still keeping the serious depressing tone. The young cast makes the characters believable as they play the part perfect. Roland Møller's acting performance is one of the highlights, just interesting to see him act in this movie. Martin Zandvliet truly made a masterpiece with this movie, showing the world that he is a great filmmaker and isn't afraid to tell a true story about the horrible events in post-ww2."
" Great but sadly underrated.
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,8,"Warning!, This review was written by a 14 year old me in 2019. The views reflected in the following review are not necessarily shared by me in the current. They're purely kept up because of nostalgia.Land of mine (under sandet), is a modern, brutal and complex war story driven by hate and relations. It is not scared to be harsh, and tries to depict the essence of tension in its time. The movie mostly succeeds at this with a constant action combined with emotions, in a experience of only just being long enough to be a feature film. Which just makes it sad that it is that underated."
" The elephant in the room
",2018-12-11 00:00:00,9,"At the end of the WWII, the German soldiers deployed in Denmark as occupation troupes became war prisoners and were used to clear the enormous number of land mines from the Baltic littoral. Did it count that so many of them were just teenagers, anonymous pieces in the game of the others? If they had been old enough to go to war, they should be old enough to clean up, so was the common wisdom. Nobody was willing to go beyond and see the elephant in the room: these teenagers had been just victims, nothing more, and from the very beginning.I came on this movie by pure chance, browsing the TV channels. It was already in the middle. I remained on it for five or ten minutes, then I passed on my laptop, and found the film on youTube. A powerful story, told in great simplicity."

" Powerful
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,9,"Land of Mine. Got limited UK cinema release (why?). A dramatisation of the forced 'clean up' of mines in post-liberation Denmark by German soldiers - most of them still in their teens. The most human, raw and upsetting war film I have ever seen. Nominated for best foreign language film at the 2017 oscars (and should have won). Just watched it for the second time. Best war film I've ever seen. Turns your usual pro-Anglo-American anti-German WW2 films we normally see on their head and replaces them with humanity - there is no 'us and them' in war. Just carnage and young people giving up their lives for 'their country'..... 9 out of ten. Harrowing yet humane. An absolute gem of a film. A tearful, powerful 9 out of ten."
" A Harsh Danish Movie
",2018-10-01 00:00:00,8,"A Danish movie about the time after World War II and the land mines Germans laid along the coasts of Jutland.A violent movie about young German boys who are set to remove the mines again after the war.
It's a very harsh movie that goes close to how the young Germans had it and how many were killed during the clearance of the mines."
" Tough story
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,8,"History in film is great if accurate. This is the case. Very realistic, we feel the danger. Still, I have no pity for the germans though."
" Great drama
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,8,"May 1945 and the war in Europe has ended. German soldiers are put to work on the Danish coast, clearing mines buried on the beaches. It is a dangerous job and the Germans are young and inexperienced. One such unit is supervised by Sergeant Rasmussen, a veteran of the war and someone who hates the Germans and what they did to his country during the war. He takes his anger out on the young boys in his unit. However, over time his attitude changes.Great drama. Deals with aspects of war that are hardly ever dealt with - what happens after the war ends, how former enemies now have to live with each other and how the victors treat the vanquished. The attitude towards and treatment of the Germans by the Danes is quite understandable and plausible. This makes the reconciliation so much more emotional.Quite gritty - the dangers the German soldiers are exposed to are highlighted very well. These dangers also up the tension, making for riveting viewing at times.Not perfect though. Some of the transformations seem too simple and quick and the conclusion feels a touch too neat. It would also have been good to see some of the characters' histories, especially the Sergeant's, to provide a bit more character depth and engagement. Not essential though, as one can easily imagine how he got to be that way.Ultimately, a great story of reconciliation."

",2018-03-10 00:00:00,9,"The Germans took an eye, whereas the Danes took a nose. Germans, young and old, got killed by land mines laid by Germans. What do you expect, have Danes get killed by land mines laid by Germans?The Danish sargeant does a lot of yelling and some face slapping, and Danish soldiers urinate on a German soldier. So? What do you expect? I did not see a Dane shoot a German in this movie. Time to pickup a copy of Schindler's list, just to compare.Sorry, but the sound of trains carrying millions to gas chambers and concentration camps will take a thousand years to quiet.The only good Nazi is a dead Nazi...and plenty of Germans were Nazis.Please, do not give me the ""get over it, forgive and forget"" crap."
" DISTURBING YET APROPOS FOR THIS DAY AND TIME
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,8,"War is a shameful thing. It is the condition of all humankind. It will never disappear as long as there is breath in a human body. This is a perfect psychological dissection of the human condition and its least desirable facet known as war. I think all people that have Pollyanna ideals of world peace should watch this. Sure what was done in the aftermath of WWII was horrible and a disgrace. The only sure thing which would have been infinitely worse was the alternative. Seeing how the German machine treated its fellow human beings during the war, is there any doubt that they would have changed direction had they won. Most cannot possibly imagine the world if Hitler and his minions had been victorious. The sanitized history taught in public schools worldwide doesn't give the full picture. We have to remember Hitler was stopped during this first phase. He never got to any of the later phases. This is a slice of history no one wants to examine. Hitler did draft children in the last days of the war. The criterion was if one could hold a gun steady, he was drafted. Children as young as 8 were made soldiers. This exposes the ever present question in the wake of devastating tragedy. Who is the real monster? Or who is the worse monster? Was it the German war machine for drafting children and putting them in harm's way during a war or the allies using the same children to ""clean up"" the mistakes of their defeated leaders? I encourage you to watch this movie and be starkly aware that you are looking at the triumphant good guys doing this to the defeated bad guys. Live with that for a while. I gave it 8 stars because it was very good, not near perfect and certainly not perfect. The principle actors were wonderful. The young guys were very believable to the painful resolution."

" Blown away !
",2017-12-25 00:00:00,9,"Not only was this right up my street it was one of the best films I have seen this year. Nominated at the Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year this is the story of a group of young German soldiers held as prisoners at the end of the war , who are ordered to dig up and disarm all of the Nazi land mines remaining on the west coast of Denmark. A Danish sergeant watches over the effort as the untrained soldiers attempt to complete their extremely dangerous punishment.
It's probably not the best description to describe what I felt about this film but I really was was blown away.
I has no idea about this part of World war II history and that the Germans planted over 1.2 million mines because they though the allies would land via Denmark and not France.
This is beautifully written and filmed by Director Pieter Zandvliet and the acting from the group of young German actors is stunning. 
Sometimes moments of silence says more than words can and the silent moments say everything in this film wether it be when they are unarming the mines or when they are in fear of the sergeant. 
It's a very sad story that I'm sure the Danes are not proud of but I'm so glad it was told with such expertise."
" all have the power to be harsh
",2017-12-22 00:00:00,10,"We've heard many stories about the Nazis' cruelty. Less is known about an event that took place right after WWII ended. The Nazis had planted a number of land mines along Denmark's coast, and Denmark made a bunch of German POWs clear the coast of the land mines. Martin Zandvliet's ""Under sandet"" (""Land of Mine"" in English) shows how the Danish sergeant overseeing the removal of the mines is often as draconian towards the young Germans as the Nazis were to everyone.In addition to showing this particular historical instance, the movie shows that every person has the potential to be cruel, even towards those associated with cruelty. Many of these young Germans were probably drafted into Hitler's army, but were then seen as agents of evil, so people felt justified in mistreating them. In dealing with those who were previously ""the enemy"", can we ever consider them something other than the enemy?I recommend the movie. Many of the scenes showing the removal of the mines are intense just for the possibility of a mine exploding. But beyond that, it's an important part of history. Good one."
" Great Post WWII Film
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,9,"This was one of the nominees for the best foreign language films at the 2017 Oscars. I would have picked it or A Man Called Ove from Sweden. The Salesman won and I was not crazy about it. Land of Mine is what the title implies, and that is the 1.5 million land mines left in Denmark by the occupying German army from 1941-1945. German soldiers were forced to remove the mines, leading to numerous injuries and deaths. Some of the soldiers were teenagers and it is heartbreaking to watch these kids become the pawns of war. The sins of the older men who took their nations to war is what makes this at thinking person's movie. The boys had no responsibility for the atrocities committed by their leaders and yet they were the one who paid the highest price. They crawl on their hands and knees as they attempt to diffuse the mines from the beach. as expected, mistakes are made and innocent children die for no good reason. Land of Mine is one great movie."
" lesser done war movie
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,7,"It's 1945 Denmark after the war. Bitter Danish sergeant Carl Rasmussen berates German POWs. He is given a group of German teen POWs to clear a stretch of mined beach. He cares little for their comfort or even their safety. Soon, the boys are injured and even dying as they starve without food. There is a woman farmer nearby with her daughter. The boys steal feed from the farm but are poisoned by rat droppings.This is definitely a lesser done war movie. Few would make a movie about after the war unless it is the soldiers dealing with the return home. It has a matter-of-fact darkness. It is brutal in a depressing way. The drawback is the failure to accentuate one boy among the group. It would be better to center the movie around one of the POWs, probably Sebastian. It becomes a generalized sadness with human compassion short on supply. When Rasmussen starts to change, it never achieves full hopefulness and I would be perfectly happy without the final redemption."
" A war film with a difference
",2017-11-07 00:00:00,7,"Just when you think you've seen all there is to see concerning World War 2 and big screen stories, along comes a film shining a light on an aspect of the war that I would imagine very few know much about.Oscar nominated Danish/German film Land of Mine delivers a non-fictional narrative of a true life aspect of World War 2, that being upon the conclusion of fighting during the great war, German POW's (mainly young soldiers) were harnessed by the Danish army to take on the arduous and literally explosive task of disarming over 2 million mines that had been left scattered across the coastline of Denmark at the height of the World War 2 conflict.This little known (at least here in Australia) aspect of post-war Europe allows director Martin Zandvliet a chance to deliver some white knuckle big screen action as our rag-tag group of young German POWS go about their business of clearing out a section of Danish coastline under the often brutal care of Roland Møller's Danish Sergeant Carl Rasmussen.Land of Mine cares very little for adding much backstory or humanising any of these characters for us, we know and understand that what these men and boys on both sides have been through would be nothing short of horrific and instead Zandvliet places us alongside the group as they face a day to day proposition of death as their month long journey to find and disarm mines consumes their day to day lives.You're never under any confusion as to what this task required and it's one of those interesting conundrums as to whose lives were more important as the Danish saw an opportunity as such to get revenge on the German's that had caused so much pain for them, even if many of the POW's tasked with the mine clearances quite clearly were not often at fault.It's a little bit of shame that we don't get to know these characters better as Zandvliet's film pulls no punches when it comes to showing the true bloody nature of the task these individuals undertook but despite the fact Land of Mine's cold approach doesn't allow it to connect to us as emotionally as we could've done with, as an examination of a shocking aspect of post-World War 2 and an insight into a different facet of the war in Europe, Land of Mine is a real must-see.Final Say – A confronting, shocking and sometimes unbearably tense war drama, Land of Mine is a war film like none other and while it never pulls off a true emotionally resonate connection, this foreign language effort is well worth digging up and one of the more impressive war films of recent years.3 ½ games of fetch out of 5"
" Worse Than A Prison Sentence
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)What could be worse than a long prison term? Here's one punishment; be forced to sweep vast beaches to uncover and disarm live mines post WWII. This is one of the rare films that attempts to make you feel compassion for Germans soon after WWII. As the film tells the true story of German POVs, many of them young boys in this film, that are forced to uncover thousands of mines that the German's buried in Denmark's beaches. These young soldiers are led by a Danish Sargent who hates all NAZI German soldier's guts. He teaches the boys how to dismantle the mines, map and count the mines and then enforce the objective. Being young and stupid boy soldiers, not the typical easy to hate NAZI commander type men, he does grow a bit of a heart for them. The film's focus was around the Sargent and the young POV's, their objective and of course the occasional accident. Very raw at times, it does scratch at your emotions but not as much as I'd imagine from such a hellish objective. Great cinematography with saturated and muted colors help drive the point home about many facets of humanity during a terrible and turbulent period in the world."
" Very sad movie
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,6,"Land of Mine is about Nazi soldiers who are so young some seem to be 14 years old. World World II ends and the Nazi soldiers who victimized the Danes are now being victimized by the Danes by the loss of the war. This shows how absurd war is. There are beautiful shots of long beaches filled with smooth looking orange sand. But the sandy beaches are covered with land mines. The Nazi soldiers who are POW's now are forced to dismantle the land mines. This movie played on my conscious. While I watched the movie, I was wondering if the Nazi soldiers POW's did not need to be released as the war was over. This movie was disturbing to me because I do not believe in the philosophy of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Yes, the Nazi soldiers had a history of being terrible to the Danes; then after the war ended some Danes (like in this movie) became visibly terrible to the former Nazi's. This kind of behaviour makes my stomach turn - as each group suffered at the hand of an aggressor. In a way this movie shows the worse side of humanity. There were pieces of kindness scattered through the film - but in essence - it appeared like many generals in charge practiced their authority in a corrupt way."
" good film but a bit too heavy
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,7,"I found this by complete accident on youtube, and was enthralled by the first scene, enough to continue and watch the entire 2 hours.Apparently, when WW2 ended, a small-ish number of German Prisoners Of War were kept by Denmark for the sole job of removing landmines, mostly as a punishment for their previous occupation of their land. The job involved laying on your belly and tapping the ground with a spike, to find a mine, and then manually disarming it. Not an easy job, and in fact about half of those put to it, either died or suffered grevious wounds.On top of all that, most of these POWs were teenagers, mostly last- minute conscripts from the Hitler Youth, forced into the war as a last ditch effort to try to win against the allies.Land of Mine is a 2015 film (of which i completely ignored the existence until just now) entirely in German, although subtitles are available, detailing the fate of one group of said children, and of their Danish instructor/warden, as they learn the dangerous job of hand-disarming live explosives, all the while trying to figure out why they are there. Now, Land of Mine is a masterfully well made film; the acting is excellent, the production is likewise top notch, and the soundtrack particularly moving; but ..It's long. It's dark. It's more than a bit depressing. This is not an easy film to watch. It will force you to ponder the horrors of war, without ever giving you a rest, a hero to admire, a victory to share. Here, war is about loss, not victory.I am not sure i can recommend this film. But if you have a friend or two who think war is cool because you shoot bad guys, then show them this film, it will change their mind.my vote will be only 7/10. it's good, but it's hard."
" Sins of the Fatherland
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,9,"This is a very profound topic as it deals with the immediate aftermath of WWII and how a generation of young people were left to cleanup after the Nazis. It speaks to the cruelty of all participants, something to be considered these days with the world's fomenting nationalistic fervor. The acting is outstanding and cinematography quite artful."
" We need more movies like that
",2017-09-28 00:00:00,10,"Land of Mine is a very pleasant surprise. Essentially it is the story of a group of 14 teenagers ( I would guess between 13-16 years old), who were obviously conscripted to fight for the German army in a war that was already doomed. When they thought that once the conflict was over, they would be allowed to come home, but they forgot about the collective punishment season.I just watched this drama based on real events and got the feeling of how awful it is to be on the losing side of a war. Many people remember fondly victory parades, surrender declarations and peace agreements. This movie show us that cruelty, violence, desperation and misery didn't end in 1945. The horrors continued for many years, in this case, the German army demobilized without retreating to their home country, so hundreds of thousands soldiers were trapped in Denmark, and the local population and military was just eager to take some revenge. Normally we associate cruelty against POWs with the Soviet Union (a country that essentially killed all their prisoners in their concentration camps in Siberia), but ""land of mine"" portraits the western armies almost as ruthless as the Russians were.So the story of these 14 kids is that they are assigned suicide missions: they are supposed to clear giant minefields along the Danish coast, and if they don't die in the explosions, the other form of killing them was trough starvation and medical neglect. Essentially they had nothing to lose, but still, in the middle of such a hopeless life, they would cling to their humanity. Some would dream about coming home, seeing their mothers once again, while others were more realistic and understood that they were already dead, and there was no reason to be optimistic.They are led by Sargeant Rasmussen, a sadistic Danish Officer, who starts to feel lonely, and slowly start feeling some compassion about the boys, who are essentially paying for mistakes from the previous generations. Because one day he let them eat some bread, his superiors threaten him and go to the barracks in order to abuse them, reminding the sergeant that they are not people, but just disposable bodies who are useful to their task.I won't tell the end, but I recommend this movie because it is a history lesson and a lesson of humanity. Despite having politicians declaring war against each other, the ordinary people that supply soldiers for every army are just normal and enemies have a lot of common with each other (there is a scene in the movie that the sergeant even allow himself to enjoy some moments of pleasure playing soccer with his captives), so we shouldn't feel any pleasure when killing civilians or unarmed prisoners in any war, because they are human beings just like us."
" Great writing makes this a powerful movie
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,8,"This movie certainly deserved its Oscar nomination.Rarely do movie stick with me for days. 'Land of mine' did.It's not an action-movie, like 'Dunkirk' or other movies set in and around World War 2. It's an important character study about humanity, desperation, resentment, anger, prejudice and hate that I think everyone need to see, even if they have no interest in World War 2. There are no good or bad guys here. Just people that try to deal with difficult situations commanded by other people above them. They should make more movies like this."
" Under the sand there are plot devices of a different kind
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,9,"This is a terrific film, albeit a bleak one, overall. The tone is set by the landscape and the cinematography, yet this windswept coastline and the farmland make for eerily beautiful scenery. Anyone who has ever completed recruit training will well understand the awesome authority an NCO wields. And in this case, the NCO definitely isn't on the same side as his 'recruits'. Carl, the Sergeant ('Feldwebel') wears British Army uniform that clearly marks him as someone who fought during the war with a parachute regiment. He has some anger management issues too. He's not someone to be messed with, in other words. And he's pretty handy with his fists, just in case the message was too subtle. Yet Carl's basic humanity shines through by the end of the film. As for the rest of the cast, all the characters are sympathetic and played for maximum intensity and realism. Much like the mines their characters are defusing, there's not a dud among them."
" I'd almost give it a perfect rating!
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,9,"'LAND OF MINE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) A Danish-German war film (based on actual events) about teenage German prisoners of war, that were forced to clear mines from postwar Denmark (shortly after the end of World War II). The film has received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, and it's won (or been nominated for) multiple prestigious awards; including a 2017 Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. The movie was written and directed by Martin Zandvliet, and it stars Roland Moller. I agree with all of it's critical acclaim, it's an amazing film!Historians estimate that following the end of World War II (in Europe), 2,000 captured German soldiers were forced to remove mines, with their bare hands, from former warzones. Many of these prisoners of war were teenagers, and they were also extremely inexperienced. It's also estimated that nearly half of them were killed, or severely wounded, by the mines. This film tells the story of a small group of those teenage German prisoners, in Denmark. It focuses on their relationship with their commanding Danish sergeant (Moller), who at first hates the boys and then grows sympathetic towards them.The movie is extremely emotional and involving. Only the least empathetic viewer could not feel something for these boys, that were forced to go through this unbelievably horrendous experience. The relationship they have with their enemy sergeant is also extremely touching and powerful. By focusing on a part of World War II history that's rarely covered (in films at least), the movie also seems original and surprisingly educational. It's a very moving story about forgiveness, in the harshest of circumstances, as well. I think it's a masterpiece that everyone should see. I'd almost give it a perfect rating, but I'm slightly hesitant to for some reason.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/hAV3iy1JkJ8"
" What else could the Danes do?
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,7,"I lived in that part of Denmark 30 years after the war ended. Many people told me of the horrors of the German occupation. A legacy of this time was the hundreds of thousands of land mines the Germans left behind. How else were the Danes going to clear them? Should Danes be blown up in the process? No, they applied the rule: ""You broke it - you fix it."" Very sad for the young Germans, but this was war.Another film showing the futility of war. And yet we go on having wars - and that fool Trump will deliver in spades."

" Danish sergeant compels young German POWs to defuse buried mines.
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,9,"Land of Mine is a thrilling tragedy about the aftermath of war. The first note is laboured breathing against a black screen; we'll rarely breathe easily for the duration. In scene after scene we wait for the explosion. Some explosions are mines, some emotional. They are equally destructive.The film is based on the Allies' historical use of German POWs, including young boys, to dig out and defuse the thousands of land mines that the German army had planted along the Danish coast to prevent the Allies' landing. Though the forced deployment of boys is clearly inhumane, it was a logical way to deal with the Germans' mines. As the German army grew dependent upon young recruits, so did this effort to restore the safety of the beaches. Though these boys may not have committed the atrocities of the war, they were still functioning enemy soldiers so their deployment was not entirely unjust.The film's central thrust is Danish Sgt. Rasmussen's recovery of his humanity. In the opening scene he proves a hard-headed brutal officer with a seething hatred of the Germans. We don't get his backstory, nor that of the isolated Danish farm woman who rents the unit her shed for sleeping. Obviously widowed by the war, she delights in seeing some Germans killed, even these innocent youths. Rasmussen's harsh treatment of the boys softens as he witnesses their efforts and suffering. He countermands the Allies' willingness to starve them. A night visit by Allied officers to humiliate them deepens his sympathy for the boys and his doubts about the victors' virtue.Theoretical virtue is challenged by a personal loss. Had she not lost her husband the woman might have responded more warmly to the boys, as she does when two retrieve her little daughter from the minefield. When Rasmussen lowers his guard and gives his charges a day off for pleasure and play, his dog's death by mine revives his former hatred. And his dehumanizing of his enemy, as he makes one act like his dog. Rasmussen ultimately disobeys his orders when he drives the four surviving boys to the border back home to Germany. At whatever cost to his career, he disobeyed his commander's order to send them back into even more dangerous action — despite the promise to send them home after the initial mission.That's where the literal mines resonate into metaphor. Whatever hatreds lead into a war, larger ones linger on after it. The hatred of the erstwhile enemy lingers buried in the mind like a mine in the sand, capable of eruption at any time. The film's lesson is our need to remember our enemy's humanity — if we are to recover our own, often perforce numbed by the exigencies of war. The Allied officers here demonstrate the inhumanity and cruelty they ostensibly fought to defeat. We know the Allies were more moral than the Axis in World War II. The Allied officers here fail the moral challenge once the war is over — and their hatred and cruelty persist. The film's specifics remain as current as the metaphoric function of the mine. That is, the film is as literally true about current wars as about that one. Troops still plant mines and unleash horrendous weapons with fatal after effects. Nations still punish their former enemies with excessive zeal. And some unscrupulous armies still weaponize their own children, using them as shields or as bombs, confident that their sacrifice will be blamed on their enemies instead."
" Some of the most heart-pulse racing moments you can have in a war history story that needs to be told.
",2017-03-29 00:00:00,8,"In matters of war, no nation is free of guilt. Regardless of whether they are produced by victorious or vanquished countries, the better war films set out facts, acknowledge wrongdoing, express regret, and seek atonement. Many of them put guilt and culpability onto the widescreen so that current and future generations may learn from the past. This is the psychological space in which we find the extraordinary Danish-German war film Land of Mine (2016).It is 1945 and the war is over, but the beautiful Danish coastline has two million deadly mines left buried in the sand by the Nazi occupation. Danish Sergeant Carl Rasmussen (Roland Møller) is assigned a squad of fourteen German prisoners of war who must clear a beach that contains 45,000 active mines. The Sergeant's treatment of the teenage boys is initially brutal: they live and work in terrible conditions, are practically starved and constantly reminded that everyone in Denmark hates them and nobody cares if they live or die. Their task is to crawl along the beach by hand, poking a stick in the sand to locate mines, then defuse them before they explode. Inevitably, many failed. With echoes of Stockholm syndrome, both captor and captives find glimpses of humanity in each other that leads to Rasmussen being suspected by his tormenting superiors of going soft on the Germans. He must walk the fine line between military obedience, personal hatred of Nazis, and his growing compassion and realisation that these are just boys who were conscripted into battle. His characterisation and its transition from hatred to acceptance frames the narrative of this high-tension drama.Stunningly realistic cinematography with minute attention to detail amplifies the horror of this story. The acting is remarkable from a mostly unknown cast and Rasmussen's performance captures the very essence of moral conflict. The mine-clearing proceeds inch-by-agonising-inch, and the film's plot line inches forward at a similar pace. With camera at sand-level, we see close-up images of teenage warriors with beads of terror trickling down their faces as their sand-covered fingers slowly un-screw a detonator from a mine, knowing that an explosion will tear their body to pieces. These are some of the most heart-pulse racing moments you can experience through film. This is not entertainment nor is it for faint-hearted viewers; several scenes are horrific.Most war films glorify battle or corner us into cheering one side or the other. This film presents an exquisite conundrum: was it morally acceptable for the Danish military to force German POWs to remove the deadly mines that the Nazi army left behind, knowing that most will die or be maimed? Or should this deadly work have been carried out by Danish soldiers? Was the inhumane treatment of teenage soldiers justifiable, regardless of the brutality of the Nazi occupation of Denmark? In the light of such questions, is this film one of justification or a confessional that seeks atonement? Land of Mine shines a bright light on what has hitherto been a dark secret of Danish history. It is a powerful and important story."
" The inhumanity and hypocrisy of war........
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,9,"Land of Mine is a stinging indictment of war. Whilst self serving, sleazy politicians who have never faced war in their pampered lives, to this day still prattle on about military conquest and the glory of war, innocent people pay the price. This can be clearly seen in this film which examines Allied mistreatment of German POW's at the end of World War II. Under the Geneva Convention prisoners of war were to be returned home. Instead, they were in many instances, used, in this case as forced labour, to clear land mines in Denmark. What's even more appalling, is many of the so called soldier/prisoners, were little more than children. This is not a film to come to lightly. As this film shows and indeed, as history records, many of those who undertook this dangerous task died. As such, at times this film, is a truly horrible watch that will outrage and sadden you in equal measure. Its well acted too, with emotional and convincing performances handed in by the entire cast. Perhaps the only positive to come from this, is it will (I hope) cement your disgust and distrust of hypocritical warmongers (assuming you do not already loathe them as I do) in all their forms. If we are very very lucky too, it may in turn help lay the foundation for a more peaceful future for us all. Nine out of ten from me."
" How much bravery is required just to persevere
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,9,"This multiply-honored Danish-German movie from Martin Zandvliet also could have been titled Land of Mines, since it is based on Denmark's real post-World War II program that used POWs to clear the mines the Germans laid up and down the Danes' western seacoast. Apparently, someone in Hitler's command believed the Allied invasion might take place there, and when the war was over, the mines had to go. In real life, we're told, some 2,000 prisoners were given the task of clearing the beaches of some 1.5 million mines—a task New York Times reviewer A.O. Scott terms ""intuitively fair and obviously cruel."" About half of these former soldiers, many of whom were mere teenagers, died or were seriously injured in the process. This movie, which has subtitles, is about 14 such prisoners and not easy to watch. Lacking the Hollywood cues that typically signal when disaster's coming and who will be next to die, every moment of training, every defusing of a mine, every run on the beach is tension-filled. Hardass Danish Sergeant Carl Rasmussen (played by Roland Møller) doesn't think these prisoners should get by with a thing, and he works them hard. The story, then, is about how he gradually comes to see them as the young boys they are. The Danes are justly praised for saving the vast majority of their Jews in World War II, despite the country's occupation by the German army, but this almost forgotten episode shows a darker side. Not everyone is capable of compassion or of easy forgiveness. And where should the Sergeant's loyalties lie? With his countrymen (and the rest of humanity) who have suffered at the hands of the Nazis or with the boys now under his absolute command? The boys condemned to this excruciating duty, with its meager diet and the receding possibility they will ever return home, are portrayed by a fourteen young actors—including a pair of twins—who are utterly believable. Is their deadly task necessity or punishment? How much bravery is required just to persevere? A recent Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign Language Film, Land of Mine was shot on location on the Danish coast. A real mine—one missed by the young searchers more than 70 years ago—was discovered during filming."
" Tough-as-nails post-WW II soldier drama from Denmark
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,8,"""Land of Mine"" (2015 release from Denmark; original title: Under sandet, ('Under the Sand'); 100 min.) brings the story of a group of German POWs in Denmark. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is ""Denmark, May 1945"", right after the end of WW II. We get to know Danish Sgt. Rasmussen, who--after violently lashing out against German soldiers leaving the country--is assigned to de-mine an area on Denmark's western coast. Apparently the Nazis anticipated a possible invasion there, incorrectly as we all know. Rasmussen gets the help of about a dozen German soldiers who are ordered to actually do the work. When the soldiers arrive, it turns out most of them are just boys. As the Germans are trained on how to de-mine, one of them accidentally detonates a mine and dies. At this point we are a good 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is a high-profile (more on that later) and expensive (for European standards) production that brings to the big screen a post WWI episode not well known by the public at large (in the movie's end titles, we learn that more than 2,000 German soldiers were involved in this enormous mining clearance project). The movie's underlying tension (namely, at any time one of those landmines may detonate when making a minor error) rarely lets up, keeping us at the edge of our seat. On top of that, there are several outright brutal scenes involving Sgt. Rasmussen's attitude towards the boy soldiers (it somehow reminded me of the first half hour of Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket). All that said, while one certainly may have empathy for the boy soldiers as a group, I found it difficult to have the same emotional investment for the individual boys, as frankly they all seemed interchangeable to me within the movie's context. But in the end, this is an eye-opening movie on many levels. Danish actor Roland Møller in the role of Sgt. Rasmussen is nothing short of extraordinary.""Land of Mine"" received immediate critical acclaim upon its release in 2015 and in fact was nominated for the 2016 Best Foreign Language Movie Oscar, yes, LAST year's Oscars. I have no idea why this movie is just now opening up in US theaters, but better late than never I suppose. The Saturday matinée screening where I saw this at in Ft. Myers was attended very nicely, much to my surprise. If you are interested in a slice of WW II history that you may not be familiar with, I urge you to check this out, be it in theater, or later on Amazon Instant Video on eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. ""Land of Mine"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
" Utterly heart-wrenching
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,9,"Boys who could be our children, searching for mines in what is an extended death game. They are, just like Germans viewed Russians and Jews, viewed as 'Untermenschen', as unworthy of compassion or even food to waste on.What did we do to one another? The European nations, utterly destroyed and forever altered in a war that should never have happened. The plan was to prevent the rise of communism in Europe, instead it turned out into the destruction of Germany and the destruction large swaths of European soil. Axis and allies, both committed terrible war crimes. This film is one of many products of that progressive insight. The Holocaust would likely never have happened, had Germany not been enclosed on two fronts: a starch ideology and no way out to deport perceived enemies leads to terrible things. Germany was no a terrible nation. Yet they did terrible things. The allies weren't terrible nations, but ruled by incompetent leaders who chose the wrong war. Germans were fighting for the future of their children. As the war lasted, their children went to fight for their own future. Hope is what carried them in this movie and hope is the note this movie ends with. But every viewer knows that it isn't hope they will find when they get back to Germany."
" A film that can portray the war very well and its drama in a different way.
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,8,"Under Sandet is the representative of Denmark pro Oscar for best foreign film, and is a film that portrays the war otherwise, shows men who has the task of digging and removing land mines, and is a heavy war drama, the performances are Strong, you see the suffering of the soldiers and their fear in this task, the direction of Martin Zandvliet is very precise, he manages to film very well the expression of the soldiers, the photograph is beautiful, the script is good, if you watch Under Sandet waiting A Saving Private Ryan, is going to be disappointed, because it is a film that does not have the task to do scenes of action, but dramatic scenes, Under Sandet is a very good film, and is a strong candidate to Oscar of best foreign film.

" This makes ""The Hurt Locker"" seem like a walk in the park
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,9,"This unbearably tense war movie is the Danish entry for this year's Best Foreign Language film. It's about a group of young German POW's who are forced to clear a minefield with their bare hands and it makes ""The Hurt Locker"" seem like a walk in the park. Brilliantly directed by Martin Zandvleit and beautifully played by a cast of mostly unfamiliar faces, this is an intelligent and unsentimental look a a piece of World War Two history usually ignored by the cinema and it has the courage to paint 'the enemy' in a good light and 'the allies' as villains. It's also beautifully shot in widescreen by Camilla Hjelm. See this."
" dangerous work
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,7,"SPOILER ALERT. the was is over. roland moller is a Danish sergeant in charge of a group of very young German soldiers, whose job it is to clear a section of the Danish beach of mines planted by the Germans in anticipation of the invasion. based on a true story. I have read a lot of books about the war but have never heard this one. unfortunately when you defuse mines, you tend to get blown up. we just don't know when. although you are never really surprised. I couldn't help but think about who fights wars-young men. an entire generation was almost wiped out in ww2. on both sides. roland moller is terrific as the sergeant and the guys playing the soldiers are very good. it's not a fun movie, and when the director lightens it up, we all pay. its not for the squeamish, let me just say that."
" You will never forget this movie
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,10,"A painful film to watch at times - the film maker does not shield us from the painful truth of what happened to the young, German soldiers (as depicted in the film) but the heart of the story carries us through. Roland Moller's portrayal of the Danish Sargent touched me so deeply. His fury and loathing at the beginning of the film (shaped by the war) turned into a visceral need to protect those in his care. I couldn't imagine any actor making this role so utterly real who hadn't been through hell, himself, and in the end came through with love. And this is the gift Mr. Moller, Martin Zandvliet, and the young German actors, leave us with."
" Grimm drama on the casualties of war
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,8,"There's a weird double edge sword going on here. Though I can't blame the Danish for being so cruel to the Germans so soon after the war ended, it's difficult in this PC world of 2017 to see this happening.Denmark forces German soldiers to clean up their mess (A series of beaches infected with their land mines) before they can go home. Making this task even crueler is the soldiers doing it don't look old enough to smoke a cigarette.It was a very honest look at the aftermath of war. The Danish military were treating the German's worse than dogs, though Germany deserved it for the part they played in WWII. Land of Mine is a focus on humanity as one Danish Commanding officer must find this with a group of German boys he commands like they were slavesLand of Mine was at times hard to look at, especially when these kids were getting blown up. A little too real on how land mines work. One minute you're there, the next minute you're gone. Sometimes you saw the explosion coming, and then they surprise you with one you didn't. It strangely added to the drama.Land of Mine was an interesting look on what it takes to turn the other cheek and forgive the enemy.http://cinemagardens.com"
" The Only Good German is...
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,8,"Mainly in German, with subtitles.The true story of how inexperienced German boy soldiers were forced to clear mines from Danish beaches in 1945. Of 2000 used in this way, some 50% died or were maimed. If nothing else, LOM is a fantastic dramatization of real events. The characters, costumes and locations seem completely authentic. The story is of hard-bitten Parachute Regiment Sergeant Carl Rasmussen (Roland Møller), who starts off as an angry, German-hating b*st*rd. Over the course of the movie, Rasmussen's character finds redemption by learning to see the Germans as individuals, not as enemy prisoners. If no-one else will, Rasmussen keeps his promise to the young men he has (justifiably) driven so hard.Allied soldiers entering Germany in 1944/45 were shocked at how young were many of the enemy they were facing; one of the great things about LOM is the young actors playing the Germans illustrate this so well, in their ragged uniforms, their fear and their naivete. We see one of them being humiliated by British soldiers, we are shown one of them with his arms blown off, and Rasmussen is gentle and sympathetic to one who is traumatically shocked at his comrade's sudden death. But while one pathetically devises an apparatus to help him do the job, we also see one of these 'poor German boys' steal a loaf of bread from a four-year-old girl. This film is about Rasmussen and how he learns to see the enemy as individuals, not whether the Germans should be forgiven Nazism. Rasmussen ultimately rises above the wrong that his country is doing the defeated, hated enemy, not out of pity but out of honour."
" Hidden Heart
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,9,"Firstly, I'd like to say that war movies don't interest or intrigue me too much. I'm a pure pacifist and unable to comprehend the hatred within humans. However, when I heard that his movie has been nominated for Oscar, I gave it a chance and now I'm certainly glad I did. What made me even more sensitive and upset in this movie is torturing young boys, treating them really badly, learning them things neither the adults should ever learn to do. It's impossible to avoid the fact that many children were greatly involved in many wars since they are so easy to manipulate, afraid to oppose and deny but they are also fast- learners, therefore ideal to recruit. Then, there is the other side of the story presented by Sgt. Carl which showed me that everyone has a heart, no matter how rough and ruthless they seem on the outside. Even though I support the humane way of treating people, I can understand why it should be different in war. The situation and tasks are too serious to risk having someone slacking off. Sgt. Carl was just following his orders but he gradually put his guard down which was quite unexpected and I think it's generally the right approach, whatever the conditions are. Things can mostly be successfully dealt with without causing traumas or should war state be an exception?So, Land of Mine opened an interesting question: Does it make you a greater leader and a bigger man by putting fear in your inferiors' bones, having no heart at all and having people that despise you? Or does the compassionate and understanding approach, having people that trust you and feel at least a little more comfortable considering the situation?"
" A follow-up war film with a difference
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,"The further the WWII dates back and the more the political correctness enhances, the more difficult it is to create a versatile, realistic film about persons and events with direct connection to it. As it has always been so that history is created and communicated by winners...Nevertheless, a famous Danish film-maker Martin Zandvliet decided to try and, in principle, succeeded. The characters are versatile, there are no black-and-white approaches (e.g. Germans - bad, the Allies - good), and the actions and logic of events seems realistic (at times predictable though). Performances are at least good, usually even great (Roland Møller as Sgt. Carl Leopold Rasmussen and all youngsters depicting Germans prisoners), and the scenery and skillful camera-work enable to create the mood suitable for such a film. Perhaps the pace was not always even and the ending was rounded up hastily, but Under sandet is definitely a distinct film not to be mixed up with other war-related works. A month ago it made the shortlist of 9 films to be considered for a nomination at the 89th Academy Awards - let's see how things go."
