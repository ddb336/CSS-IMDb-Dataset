" Unbelievable in the worst way!!
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,3,"This movie has suspense, yes. But the story itself is stupid and unbelievable. The moment they opened the door in the basement and the old guy shot at them, killed the prisoner and grieved, they could have just hit the old guy's head and ran away with it. But they didnt!!! And this girl, i dont think if it was for real, i would still be thinking about the money over my life.. this is super extra and not even fiction!!! Im so mad because this wasnt the one i was expecting based on so much good reviews. This is just stupid and only morons, brainless sht heads would love this."
" Why keep making ill actions?
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,5,"Well developed plot, but some scene just doesn't make senses. The protagonists keep giving up logical sense and making all kinds of stupid decision.
It would have be a much better movie if writer don't make the protagonists like morons."
" Could of been better
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,5,It wasn't terrible but it wasn't amazing. Good story but I felt there could of been more too it
" THOSE SHOTS THOUGH
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,9,"Such a brilliant story with so many plottwists. I was not expecting that at all. And the way they shot this movie, very detailed and long shots!! Pretty outstanding!I wish there were more movies like this 😊"
" Annoying
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,1,"The gold digging bi*** took the money and lived happily ever after !! poor alex he just wanted to call the cops he deserves to live not the fu***** wh*** , the crazy dude is gonna kill them and the bi*** ""we can't take the money??"" Funk you !"
" Very well done
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,9,A well made horror movie with a believable plot and characters. Not to mention great horror moments and a truly un expecting twist. This is a must watch for anyone!
" This Movie is DISGUSTING TRASH!!!
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,1,"Makers of this TRASH, You're giving perverted ideas to the many CRAZY folks out there! Use what LITTLE talent you have to produce movies worth peoples' time!!!"
" Exciting but deeply flawed
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,5,"The film is well made technically but it suffers from some deranged morality and a few massive plot holes. You can only suspend your disbelief so much for a movie that doesn't involve the supernatural or futuristic technology or a fun dive straight into the absurd/gratuitous/slapstick/satirical.It's more thriller than horror, though there is a mortifying scene involving a turkey baster.The film has a major likeability problem with all of its characters, though the blind vet's problem is so titanically contrived it asks the audience far too much. How exactly did this blind man pull it off? He'a a vet, so sure he's got skills, but come on man. I feel that desperate twist, turkey baster and all, was shoehorned in when someone influential in a bs buzzword bingo meeting went on about ""subverting expectations"" - code for ""I'm well connected so here I am on this project despite being largely a mediocre judge of good storytelling"".Had the movie not bothered setting up dubious moral justifications (a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do to get to California from Michigan) I wouldn't bother examining it so much, but it's the creators' very strange decisions that leave me wondering if they are simply a bit off in their heads.They could have done so many other things to make the blind man less pure (maybe he shot a bunch of innocent folks while on a rampage working for Blackwater in Iraq) but they chose an outlandish route, including some cheap psychopathic relativism masquerading as hard-won philosophy for good measure. Then they beat you over the head with naked continuity problems, often involving the dog (by then the only likeable character for the sane viewer, bravo!).How about the time when the vet punches the boy out after a struggle in the workshop and then reaches for the shears to finish him off? How exactly did the blind vet (who until that moment was very proficient) mistake the positioning of the man he was just punching and plunge the shears into the other body that was lying around? That was to set up another absurdity later on when the boy wakes up and begins to enter the hallway only to see the dog watching the doorway. The dog charges at him, the boy clearly dodges back inside the room, the dog follows him in and then POOF the boy magically appears outside of the room somehow behind a door that he uses to lock the dog inside the room with. Meanwhile, some awful - and awfully unnecessary - things are about to happen in the basement but apparently instead of barking its ass off the dog took a nap and so the now-bad-as-well vet hears nothing to warn him. It wasn't the first nor would it be the last time that the dog pops in and out of existence when the increasingly weak story needed a boost or a crutch. How did the blind guy forget his dog in the car? The same dog whose barking he followed to locate the damn car??Cheap parlour tricks and the subconscious nihlistic confessions of the film's depraved creators combine with a handful of genuinely good scenes to leave the final product a busted flush in the end."
" One of those tense must see thrillers
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,8,"This film is truly a very very good film, taking into account the limitations the director put on himself , it delivers almost perfectly. Yes there are one or two ""why wouldn't you just"" moments, but that being said we this a great Friday not thriller film with friends or.loved ones...trust me I'm pretty smart with these things :-)"
" Half and half
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,5,Dont ask questions - the suspense is good if you can turn your brain off.There was so many holes in the film that makes it seems far fetched but a film based on such a daft premise it is executed fairly well keeping this in mind
" The thriller of thrillers.
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,8,"Once people heard the concept of this movie they were down with it and who wouldn't be. 3 young adults B & E into some old blind guys home to rob him blind and then they get blindsided when the guy happens to be a sociopathic war vet with a penchant for violence. This movie speaks for itself but the only thing is that with the limited space and all the cat and mouse aspects, it never felt suffocating or claustrophobic which is too bad. On the other hand the movie is loaded with suspense and quality production and acting. This is more thriller than horror but does have some scare qualities if you are a novice when it comes to movies. Great watch."
" Get to the point quickly...
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,7,"The good side about this movie is get to the point quickly. There is no boring moments. However there are few things that you may wonder..1. Is the Blind man really blind? Few scenes you will wonder how he gets to the spot so quickly. Even in his house, like he is not blind at all. Perhaps, visually impaired is more appropriate, meaning he is partially blind. I just found it impossible for him to fumble around stuff so quickly and move from one spot to other spot like his eyes are normal.2. The settings are too dark. Many times (because of the night time in the house) It is not easy to see .3. People only get hurt and recover so quickly. You will wonder as if they don't get hurt at all. Well i understand it is a movie, can't expect much reality from it.Overall, it is okay movie, it can get you watching without boring moments."
" WELL EXECUTED!!
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,8,"An excellent Thriller. We are far from the haunted house cliché because nothing paranormal in this film. Like what, there is no need for repeated jumpscares to create a terrifying and unhealthy atmosphere."
" Great thriller with constant tension throughout
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,7,"When a group of teenagers decide to rob the house of a blind man, they get more than they bargained for when they realise this won't be like taking candy from a baby. This film was made on a relatively small budget and for that it deserves to be applauded. The central idea about the blind man and the way he uses his environment compared to the thieves is a good concept. In theory, with light they have the advantage, but without it the advantage switches. And the way this theme was developed wasn't bad. However, it's not as engaging as it could have been as I felt a certain disinterest in the outcome of the thieves. I think it's because of a lack of character development. We see Rocky and her sister living in not great conditions at the start of the movie so we know she wants the money to create a better life for her and her sister. But this section is brief. As for the boys, their back story was little to nothing. Enough time wasn't spent to let us get to know the teenagers before the action began, which meant that I didn't really care too much about what happened to them. There is also a big problem with plot holes. There were probably at least 4 or 5 times during the film where I thought ""why would the characters do this? Or how the hell is that possible?"" Another issue relates to a revealing scene later in the movie where the film loses its conviction in its own idea and goes more mainstream. The funny thing is, that was when the film was at its most interesting. But it was because of the shocking reveal that the viewer could finally understand something about the blind man that made him more than just what he'd been shown to be to that point. It's an extreme scene and somewhat uncomfortable to watch, but it provided some motive for what was happening up to that point.
Overall the film had potential. It's only 88 mins which means there was room to extend it a little to give us more of a back story to the main characters. That said, The cinematography, score and cast performance are all terrific."
" Not bad and rather unique
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,7,"I was expecting this film to be cheesy and well, crap! But I was surprised. I feel it grips the audience really well."
" Creepy factor
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,8,Good gripping suspense. The old guy is not a normal person. He lost his daughter in a car accident. Got paid a settlement. But he kidnapped the car driver and has kept her hostage in his basement. He wants to impregnate her to have a baby.
" Not an ordinary movie
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,8,"Wow, I went in almost sure it would be an average movie. How wrong was I? Can't wait for the sequel."
" Loyalties and morality tested
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,7,"This film comes from a very dark place and it plays brilliantly with ideas of heroism and protagonist sympathy.The heroes are morally bankrupt thieves, using a fathers security clearance to override burglar alarms and steal what they want. But the woman, Rocky, has good intentions, desperate to move out from her alcoholic and abusive mother's house and build a new life in California.So as viewers, partition the crime, how far are we prepared to believe in Rocky and back her up? At first their crime seems utterly repugnant, robbing a blind war hero in his own home, but as the crime defends into chaos we discover that the blind man isn't exactly a fine upstanding citizen of sound character.What follows is an excellent crime action thriller. Some well crafted Hitchcock inspired tension and full on action movie violence."
" Disappointing
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,1,"I decided to watch this after so many positive reviews everywhere, but turned off after like 20 Minutes. So stupid at the beginning; no masks to hide their faces as clearly in the modern days everyone has cameras. They left a bunch of DNA everywhere. After the robbery scene bad acting, I mean really bad and stupid acting and dialogues. Felt like watching a B movie. Night try to finish one day, right now it's just ridiculous."
" Superb Horror
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,9,"Really excellent horror movie. I went in expecting it to be a run-of-the-mill forgettable horror movie with all the same jump and gore garbage. Instead I found an ever surprising gem of a horror movie. I'll admit it might not be as good the second time, once you know all the twists and turns, but man oh man is this a great horror movie."
" Dissapointed!!
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,9,This was probably the worst movie that I have ever saw. The person that deserved to die the most survived in the end and I hated it. I hope we can destroy this film so no one has to watch it ever again.
" Ending Ruined a Decent Horror Flick
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,6,"While the blind man was in hospital, detectives would have found the dungeon, the chilled sperm, newspaper clipping of a missing woman. Clothes of a women... the list is endless. Stupid stupid stupid ending, almost ruined the movie. Wine be watching the stupid sequel."
" Very good thriller
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,9,"A very good thriller, with a nice finale. Lot of suspens and a surprising twist."
" A Great Horror thriller movie
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,9,"Gripping ... excellent .. marvelous movie ...Alex from 13 reasons why (clay Jensen ) , a brilliant actor ..and girl from evil dead also justify her acting talent ..we all know about Stephen ,how good he is !! No question about his acting . Three normal thief got something about a house where a blind man with his fierceful dog lived..they seemed to confident about the task but after the entry ,the scene was totally opposite ..that blind man was just not blind he was a psycho ..an incredible horror thriller ...Ty for this movie waiting for part 2"
" disgusting .Please check the sexual content before watching
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,1,"I honestly wish I could say that I enjoyed this movie for it's great sound design and camera work however, I found this movie to be disgusting in regards to it's sexual assault scene.
This scene is disgusting on all levels and it only purpose in this movie is to shock the audience. I warn anyone who fines sexual assault scene to be too much to stay clear of this movie. Please check the sexual content before watching"
" Some nice moments...
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,3,The movie has some nice moments but mostly due to plot holes and idiotic protagonists who are by the way very unlikable. It's a shame that they got away.
" Tense
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,8,I think this is a remake of a Saturday Night Thriller from 1982 called 'A walk in the dark' starring Dennis Quilley
" It's Breathtaking every time you see it
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,8,"I do not know how many times I have watched this movie now. Maybe around five times. Even though I always know what is going to happen the feeling of being nervous and trapped in a house makes my skin crawl. When the public can feel that, you have succeeded with a film in my opinion.
Now, I am not people, I am just one person but when I read the reviews of this film it is obvious that many feel the same as I do.
Don't Breathe came out in 2016 and was directed by Fede Alvarez who a few years before did the fairly good remake of Evil Dead. In that film Jane Levy hade one of the prominent roles and she is also the lead in this horror movie. Her character Rocky is a poor girl in Detroit that together with her friend Alex and her gangster-boyfriend Money, robs houses. When all three youths decide to do one last lifechanging heist they go to an old and blind war-veterans house. Is this house an easy way to riches? Is the man as harmless as he seems? Or will this be a start of a horror movie?
I think the premise for this film is solid. I have heard that some think it is unconvincing and unrealistic. I mean, it is twisted and farfetched, but it is all about context. I never doubted the story. It is a good not overcomplicated horror film. When the story is simple you get more time for the characters and creating an environment that makes us believe in it more. All the three actors that plays our robber ""protagonists"" are three perspectives of lost young people who tries to change which the actors convincingly deliver to the viewers. The old blind man resides in an old abandon neighborhood in an old and creepy house. It is old, dirty and you get the feeling that it has secrets. The house really comes to life. But apart from the house, it is the man inside it that really takes this film to the best of horror heights.
I was first introduced to the actor Stephen Lang when I was five years old. He had a smaller role in the western Tombstone from 1993. Since then I have seen him come and go and have always been excited when he shows up. Even though it is often in smaller parts. So, when he finally got a bigger part in Avatar, I was so happy, but also a little sad because the character was not that interesting. But in Don't Breathe he has more ability to act and wow can he act. He can go from sad and pathetic to demonic and horrifying in one second. His characters history evolves in a decent pace as the film progresses and for me, he is the reason this film is so good.
So, every time I see Don't Breathe it is just breathtaking. That is mostly because of Stephen Lang. But also, because everyone else puts in a good effort, not at least Fede Alvarez. That is why Don't Breathe is so good as a whole."
" Fantastic!
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,8,"Keeps you gripped to the screen, brings you to the edge of your seat and you might as well bite your nails! Amazing how it goes! Do not miss!"
" love this movie highly recommend
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,9,"Don't Breathe: That rare modern horror film that uses tension building and atmosphere. With an unsettiling preformance from Stephan Lang and a totaly original story while being full of hitchcocking suspence and twists to create real modern horror, Don't Breathe is that rare modern horor film that succeds Intellectually as well as viscerally. if you like horror it is a must watch!"
" There is nothing a man cannot do once he accepts the fact that there is no god
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film. I'll be very honest here and say that when I first watched the trailer for 'Don't Breathe' I didn't think it would be all that spectacular or anywhere near the thrilling feature film that was advertised.It was refreshingly intense. I definitely didn't think this film could keep you fixated from start to finish when it looked to be set solely in one location a creepy house. However I'll happily admit that I was wrong.After reading all the positive reviews and raves about the film after it's release I thought I would add this to my lists of modern day horror without expecting to see anything new or be absolutely blown away by it, however I was still hopeful that I would have an edge of my seat type experience.'Don't Breathe' is full of suspense and intensity and while watching the story unfold with it's three young delinquents (Jane Levy as Rocky and Dylan Minnette as Alex are the standouts) and their present lifestyles, you start to change your opinion and your feelings to who the true victims are.The setting is brilliant with the neighbourhood looking desolate, dark, run down and abandoned except for seemingly one living person an old, blind, reclusive veteran portrayed beautifully by Steven Lang. This film puts your mind into a dark place which is claustrophobic, dramatic and makes you feel fearful and isolated for our protagonists.It leaves you shocked many times and just when you think you know what's going to happen next it puts something new and unexpected in the way so you are left feeling stunned and aghast.This is one of the better modern day horror/thriller films which is executed to the best of it's ability. There is no cheap jump scares or over the top violence here just realistic terror which will make you think twice about underestimating what some people are capable of.8/10"
" A crime, horror and thriller that will keep the audience entertained till the very end.
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,6,"Don't Breathe is a breathtaking film scripted by Fedo Alvarez and Rodo Saeges.
Directed by Fede Álvarez, the film is a crime, horror and thriller that will keep the audience entertained till the very end.
The film stars Stephen Lang, Daniel and Jane as the main characters, the thieves.
A gang consisting of a young woman and two young men who commit petty thefts break into the house of a rich and blind old soldier for theft and the old man recognizes the presence of thieves.
With this, the course of the film changes to a point where even the viewer cannot breathe.
The film shows the subsequent events. The audience will be left wondering if they will come out alive in the end
Worrying.
Those who get a glimpse of the theater will have a good experience.
Anyway a movie that movie lovers should definitely see."
" thrilling thriller but lacks other stuff
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,5,"This is one of thrillers that fulfill their genre, meaning it is really thrilling to watch it. Apprehensive, difficult, complicated, unpredictable, scary. But the lack of other people, police, locations makes this very poor movie. Very limited area and number of actors makes this less unpredictable than usually and boring. I expected more of everything. The best actor is that young boy who stayed almost to the end, and has nice facial expression, perfect for thrillers and similar genres."
" Better Than Expected
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,7,"Fede Alvarez, the man behind the Evil Dead remake, returns to tell an original horror story about a trio of burglars breaking into an old blind mans house, only to realize he isn't as helpless as he seems. Don't Breathe stars Stephen Lang, Jane Levy and Dylan Minnette in a film that I wasn't too overly excited for. Most mainstream horror films nowadays usually aren't very good and judging by the trailer, the movie seemed to be a little corny and would be one of those dumb character movies, where the audience is left frustrated by the actions of some of the individual's in the film. However this film left me completely shocked. I did not expect to like this movie as much as I did, nor sing as high of appraisal. This is a well done horror film, that offers something new, while paying homage to the genre. Though the characters in the film feel very stock, Alvarez was able to write them in a way that didn't make them feel like complete idiots. Apart from one character, I myself was able to place myself in the shoes of the victim's and the moves they made were ones I would have. Alvarez crafted one of the most suspenseful movie of the year, each action serves a purpose and it smartly explained why the characters couldn't just easily escape their situation. Now this is all well and good until the final act where the film loses its suspense and goes for a typical slasher approach. I felt the character you were supposed to root for the most, was now making laughable decisions, and the inclusion of the never ending, invincible dog that felt funny and totally out of place. I also could have done with a bit of a darker ending, I understand the original climax ended on a sour note and the creators didn't want the audience leaving unsatisfied. However I felt like the ending they settled with felt too safe. Overall I really enjoyed my time with this film and am really looking forward to re-watching it, it was a unique horror film released to the genre public that felt fresh. Which is more than I can say for most horror films. It is a shame that the final act does suffer from weak writing, but apart from that I can't help but recommend this film, especially if you want to feel uneasy, Don't Breathe gets a 7.5/10."
" Great filmmaking
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,7,"It's a suspense masterclass but I must say I was rooting for the blind guy against the main female character. She was selfish, obnoxious and got the only decent human being in the film killed. She also ditched him to save herself on numerous occassions. Great film though."
" Unique, Terrifyingly, Thrilling and Unpredictability. Very Underrated Movie
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,8,"I never knew a kind of movie like this, interesting and unique concepts, terrifying in every scenes, amazing acting performances, just a bunch of home intruder who breaking to a blind psychopath old man house who make this movie more interesting and terrifying to watch."
" Better than expected
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,7,"I had avoided this one for a while because i thought the plot was a bit meh. But as i needed a set of movies for this Halloween i gave it a shot.. and it was better than i had feared.
Thankfully the movie is quite short so it doesn't drag out a plot that is still pretty thin and there was a welcome little twist that i hadn't seen coming.
It is, as others have said, well directed and manages to avoid falling in too many obvious traps and keeps you interested.
Biggest problem is that you don't really feel for the kids or at least i didn't. They pretty much asked for it themselves. Also i would have done the ending differently, but that's just me."
" How did the film got positive reviews?
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,5,"I was very much excited for this movie but after the movie ended I was having mild headache.The plot was pretty simple and poorly executed. Acting was bad, especially of those three thiefs. Director tried his best to grow sympathy for these characters but you will be angry on them throughout the film. Film's runtime was less than 1 hr 30 min but even after this it's pace was too slow. Movie was not even finished half and I was like "" when will this end?"". I was neither excited nor thrilled while watching this. What I was seeing were the plot holes and stupidity.Overall, you may give a try but if you come out unimpressed or with headache, don't blame me. I warned you."
" Excitedly
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,8,"It is one of the exitedly movies that i have seen before i emphatically recommend this movie
i appreciate it"
" FLAWLESS thriller!! Best in a long time, must OWN!!
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,10,"This is what I call a bluray worthy purchase movie, it's so exceptional you have to own the movie so you can watch it at least once a year. Streaming us great but sorry OWNING is better!! I dont need 4k ultra for e very movie but great movies like this is a must own. Nothing more to say except, BRAVO!!! Encore please."
" Make some noise
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,7,"Don't Breathe is a well made suspenseful flick, the cast is also good. The only trouble with this movie I got is logic - how you beat someone with a highly developed hearing ability who can't see!? Simple, you make a lot of noise (activate radio, TV, some kitchen devices, or just drop some stuff here and there etc. etc.) Anyway, if you put your brain on sleeping mode, Don't Breathe is an enjoyable piece."
" Stressed me out
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,9,Watched this one yesterday. It was stressful! Had me on the edge of my seat throughout the movie. Loved it!
" What he cannot see, he can sense
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,7,"I'd read that this film was a good horror film before watching it, so went in with reasonably high expectations, and was not disappointed!'Don't breathe' has its share of obvious horror references and tricks of the trade but it uses lots of interesting cues and twists to keep you guessing. The three burglars were quite well imagined - contrasting enough in personality and background to set the scene up for their respective falls. However, the blind man and his backstory were the part of this film that really hooked you in once the suspense kicked in.So...what I loved first. There are quite a few nicely pitched scenes in this film with great setups and triggers that create layers of suspense. The Blind man sensing his intruders set up these really well thought out scenes. When he is panning his gun round the room trying to work out whether he should fire or not - and you can see Alex and Rocky's reactions to his sense guessing - this is nerve shredding stuff. Really good filming and something I can't think I've seen in other films (maybe Hitchcock-like I guess). The second scene that stands out is when Alex falls onto the glass ceiling and we slowly see the cracks emerge - nothing new there, sure. But it's the situation it creates as the blind man shows up once again that makes it great. The scene towards the end with Rocky and the dogs was ...brilliant...maybe my favourite (in spite of the intriguing blind man character and all of his scenes). For all Rocky's obvious faults she is clearly resilient, and I love how she finds unique ways of seeing off the dogs each time they attack her. Great camera angles, initiative, and all the surprises are hatched well and deliberately. Essentially, these scenes demonstrate that this film thrives on all of its unpredictable moments within an atmosphere of suspense.Whilst I was impressed by the film I felt it could have achieved more. It felt like it was missing a couple of key elements which would have propelled it into classic territory (although I'm sure many may consider it a classic in the future). I wonder firstly if the film could have been made more suspenseful by making it that bit longer. They could have built up Alex and Rocky's background a bit more at least, just to give us a bit more involvement in them before they get inside the blind man's house. Or they could have even used yet more suspense in some of the key scenes to really nail those horror elements to the ground. Perhaps I'm being overly critical now, but I think they could have also made the blind man even more interesting, and perhaps even a bit creepier for effect.No monsters in this film, but it showed you can still do a good horror without them. And understanding the blind man's motivations, as well as the burglars set this all up well for the perfect storm it was.This and 'It Follows' are definitely two of the better horror films I've scene in the last few years. Both worth a watch."
" I did not like this movie

hey are pudding around in the house
Not want to give any spoiler away here

The only thing I can thing is
Why don't Know why they

Really Really"
" Aside From A Good Performance From Stephen Lang, And The Brutal Violence, This Film Fails Entirely
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,4,"Pros:
1. The violence is shockingly brutal and has a visceral feeling to it.
2. The silence, when used, is very effective in inducing tension and suspense.
3. Stephen Lang (The Blind Man) gives a really good performance.Cons:
1. A couple lines of dialogue are blatantly post-production additions: ""We do this tonight.""
2. There are some bizarre and lazy plot devices to increase tension. For example, how does The Blind Man smell foot odor from 3 metres away, which conveniently alerts him to foreign presence.
3. The score is massively overused and becomes annoying as a result.
4. The camera shots and angles are rather peculiar at times, thus being distracting.
5. There are some ridiculous, and unexplained, plot-holes: A) Somehow the police doesn't work out the pattern of houses being burgled that belong to the same security firm. B) The neighbours don't hear the gun-shots. C) The Blind Man impossibly covers a lot of ground in 10 seconds. D) Alex (Dylan Minnette) gets fatally stabbed and beaten, yet he recovers as if he barely got touched.
6. Towards the end, there is some needless and ugly slow-motion."
" Well made film held back by the script
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,6,"This movie is very well shot, Alvarez has talent as a director. The sound design is also very impressive and the music is used very well. All this makes for great suspense. So on a technical level I am impressed by this movie. However, when it comes to the script? Yikes. So many questions and logic lapses that it is ridiculous. There is no character in this movie to really root for. Frankly I wanted the three kids who broke into the blind man's house to all die because they're all unlikable. Stephen Lang did a good job in the movie. Dylan Minnette was awful as usual, the guy has only one emotion when acting. The others were serviceable."
" A Typical 'GOTCHA!"" Film
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,6,"I started watching this film and right from the Get-Go of the opening part of the movie, it gets right to the heart of things with quite a scene that looks straight out of a nightmare. As for the rest of the movie, It's a lot like The Panic Room, but a more twisted version and a home-invasion, but the heart-in-your-mouth factor comes from the fact that the three burglars cannot get out. There's lots of heart pumping action. For awhile, you think the blind man is the good guy...."
" Purely terrifying!
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,10,Warning: there are some triggers in this film. However that aside it's absolutely terrifying. Well done. Lots of jumps. Surprisingly worthy adversary in the villain. Holy crap.
" Leaves you breathing hard! Suspenseful, dark, witty.
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,9,"A thriller that keeps you glaring at the screen most of the time. The movie starts of a little slow and then takes multiple twists, each leaving you asking for more. The main antagonist, I believe, is also the main protagonist, being blind, having lost his daughter, then his money, only to move towards a darker path. They often say that losing a child can mould a parent into a demon. That is also evident in this movie. The secondary antagonists are the two burglars (Alex and Money). Yes, Alex is NOT a protagonist. A greedy woman who chooses the bad guy over the secondary protagonist (Rocky) and continuously gets others in danger because she values money more than their lives, and hers. The blind man kidnaps, violates, murders a woman and then two more men, violates Alex and then she runs off with his money. No one got justice. You will continue to feel pity for Rocky as the movie progresses. He's forced into burglary, has a crush on Alex, which she exploits, is mistreated by Money and finds himself thrice under harms way because of Alex. He chickened out in the begining when Money brought a gun. That was the only smart thing any burglar did in the movie. Sure, the blind man was a bad man, but when you break into a blind man's home, you'll get what's coming your way. Don't want trouble or to be shot at, don't steal."
" Intense
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,8,"Most of the characters in here are awful people, but at least they give us a reason why we should still want to watch them and root for them as things get more intense. Once this movie goes to crazy town, it doesn't let up and you'll be on the edge of your seat."
" Unbelievable

" ~plot Holes by The Plenty~
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,4,"Ok so the plot holes and goofs have been covered for the most part but this one really bugs me and I haven't seen it mentioned... how did the Rotti get in? It was not only drugged but also chained up outside. The burglars had to break in via a high(ish) window that was promptly boarded up. If the dog came in through a doggy door, couldn't they, too have gone both in and out via the same access point?"
" Director hard!
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,7,"Definitely suspenseful!!!
The director did a great job in developing the characters especially the hearing impaired one. Liked the gender equality and the action throughout each scene."
" A well shot but mediocre package that vastly overstays its welcome.
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,3,"It's fast paced, it's entertaining at times and it's very cinematic. But the cliches are omnipresent, which makes you feel as if you had watched this many times already.At USD 9 million, it still feels surprisingly cheap at times, and is barely saved by a good end at the second act, contrasting wildly with it stale mid-point.The 3rd act is a total mess on the other hand, managing to drag on into the absurd for a good 25 minutes, and don't get me started on the ending."
" Super thriller
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,9,"This movie buckles you to your seat. The performance from all of 'em is great. The blind man's performance is top notch., that made this movie the perfect survival thriller. Appreciate the novelty and creativity of the film, the location, the direction."
" Sucks
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,2,I found myself rooting for the blind guy. Why should I root for any of the thieves? The girl who gets away with the money she stole after she agreed to rob a blind vet who had lost his daughter to steal the settlement!!! Why are we supposed to root for her again? She agrees completely when she finds out he's a blind vet. Agreed the vet should have been jailed but they just couldn't leave the money. Her greed gets her two boyfriends killed and she gets to keep it all. No problem all the dead bodies this robbery left in it's wake. If she had an ounce of morality she would have left the money and waited for the police. Too bad all this talent was wasted on a plot that makes NO sense.I want a refund.

📜 Plot : When 3 Robbers plan to Rob a rich blind oldman , things go out of control when the blind man hunts the robbers.
.
👨‍⚖️ Review : Don't Breathe is one hell of a thriller. Its filled with tension and chilling scenes from the get go. The movie gears up without wasting time and sets the mood of a classic thriller. An simple robbery gone wrong and the after a time you feel sympathy for robbers and root for them to survive after the blind man turns rogue. An Edge of the seat classic from Fede Alvarez where he doesn't focus of jump scares, the horror is rather because of the blind man. Background Sounds of Robbers breathing in fear sends chills down your spine.Stephen Lang at 64 looks is lethal and brutal as the blind man. Jane Levy shines with a incredible performance with accurate expressions of panic and fear. Dylan as Alex too was very good. A Overall Classic Thriller.

" Don't Breathe is a super-tense thriller
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,9,"A tense shocker that's bubbling over with dread, violence, and just about every bodily fluid you can think of, Don't Breathe delivers the type of movie that I forgot I needed; the type of movie that demands not just to be seen, but to be experienced. The characters and plot are great! The sound quality is exceptional! Highly recommended!"

",2020-06-22 00:00:00,10,"Awesomely scripted, beautifully arranged, on many point this movie got me scared, eventhough this is not a ""ghostly"" horror movie but still the silence of the atmosphere and the ghost-like sudden apperance of that beastly oldman is enough to freak stronger to stronger humanbeing out, still in somepoints like the empty neighborhood and in the ending police didn''t find the suspeciousness in this basement is questionable but who cares right? in the end this movie accomplishes its point ""DON'T BREATHE""W A I T I N G F O R T H E N E X T P A R T <3"

This movie is not recommended for over critics. Instead of watching the movie, they are looking for negatives. For those over critics, I would say, there is no movie in this world for u to watch."
" AN EDGE OF THE SEAT BREATH TAKER
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,7,"Dont Breathe is that rare film I have seen, which took my breath away. It is a fine piece of art, about three people who go to rob a blind man's house. But that man turns out to be more dangerous than expected. Like their previous venture, Evil Dead, this one has very little blood. I really admire that part, for, blood would clearly be a misfit in this film.
I loved everything in this film from the performances, to the tense scenes that unknowingly took me to the edge of the seat. The atmosphere was dark and unsettling, the cinematography was good. They managed to do everything,in a film like this, to impress the audience. Skipping, Don't Breathe, would be quite a sin.
I rate Don't Breathe: 7.5/10"
" No one talking about how this is people under the stairs
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,5,"Is this not the exact same plot as the people under the stairs? The Rottweiler the crawling through walls, robbing a house in a destroyed neighborhood"
" Remove it from Horror Genre
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,2,The reason of watching this movie was because it was in the horror genre. Its just a thriller not a horror movie. It was a full waste of time for me. Watch something else if you wish to see some horror movies.
" Introduction and plot
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,8,"So from my prospective
This movie is awesome. I don't have words to explain this. So if you are interested in horror genre then this movie is for you.
Let's talk about the storyline :
Three thieves, small house, a old blind man, no neighbours and a mind blowing suspense.
I think these words are enough to explain everything.Mind blowing and fantastic direction, choreography has been done."
" Thrilling and suspenseful movie about a robbery gone wrong.
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,9,"This is an effective exercise in building and maintaining suspense. A group of thieves get more than they bargained for when they break into the property of Stephen Lang's wealthy home-owner. Though blind, he is far from helpless, as they soon discover. The film is only let down by one or two over-the-top moments that cross into the realms of the gratuitous."
" Intense ""Saw"" inspired thriller
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,6,"As in the Saw franchise bad guys are getting trapped and punished. I liked this film a lot, especially because I dislike burglars that much. The blind guy is far from being ""good"" but the three morons trying to steal from him get what's coming. I didn't like that the girl was portrayed as ""good"". She took part in the robberies as much as the others and hence deserves the same fate."
" Alvarez made some things you won't see coming...
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,7,"""Don't Breathe"" is a 2016 horror thriller directed by Fede Alvarez starring Jane Levy and Stephen Lang. In the first few minutes I was bothering my head about where I know the lead actress from and after I could not find a solution to my overthinking, I paused it and had to look it up. After this short break I found out that I knew her from ""Evil Dead"" and furthermore realised that this film was produced by the team behind said remake (e.g. Sam Raimi) and even was directed by the same director as well. Then I knew I was in for something for some hard stuff. Surprisingly, this film is the total opposite of the gore fest that the remake is and went into a more realistic and thriller type of horror film instead. Afterwards I learned that Alvarez came up with the idea for this film on the basis of the heavy criticism he received for his previous feature, mostly for the fact that he allegedly used only gallons of blood to shock the audience. Therefore he came up with the idea for this film and I think he successfully proved that he is capable of doing something completely different as well. The film's concept is basically simple: Teenagers break into an old man's house to steal his hidden fortune. Sounds simple? It is, but one may justifiably ask: How does the horror come into the picture then? The horror in this case is something you will not see coming at all. I wasn't either. I was mildly underwhelmed but simultaneously heavily impressed that the film passed on using any form of paranormal or supernatural horror and approaches its premise with extreme realism instead. It is mostly created by the haunting tension and the characters' constant fear of getting caught that also gradually begins to infest the viewer as well. All of this happens due to the development of both the characters and the story. Speaking of which, the main characters are one of the main reasons of this movie's success, because you can't really tell who plays what role. The three burglars might be the apparent protagonists of the film, but there are some major reasons that make it extremely hard to consider them the heroes of the story. Even though their motivation to rob a man is the simple desire to leave their hometown of Detroit and especially their dysfunctional families and start a new life from the money they are hoping to heist, it doesn't change the fact that they are illegally stealing from a blind, old war veteran who received the money as a settlement from people who killed his only beloved daughter in a car accident. Thus, the definition of who is the hero and who is the villain is in limbo in the beginning and I think how it deals with this question in the process is one of the film's most brilliant aspects. It is undeniable that the actions of Rocky and company are morally questionable and are obviously not the right solution for their problem, but it is hard to judge them completely, given their current troubled life situation. In a weird way it makes them authentic and human. Except for that complete moron Money, I felt extreme sympathy for both Rocky and Alex. The same applies to the blind man with no mentioned name. Imagine you served your country and return scarred and marked from combat and the only real joy in your life is the close relationship to your only daughter who eventually dies in a car accident and the only thing that is supposed to compensate her life is an enormous amount of money. Just imagine that is what is left of your miserable life and then some greedy teenagers try to steal that from you as well. Wouldn't you be upset about this as well? As written in stone as it may sound, the film ingeniously manages to let this conception crumble with enough shocking twists and your perception about all the characters shifts immensely in the process. The story is another of the film's biggest advantages. Despite the absence of any paranormal threat, it definitely doesn't lack the tension that is needed in this kind of movie and it undoubtedly takes a lot of creativity to create a certain suspense in such a limited setting all the while trying to stay true to the intended realism. The outcome is without a doubt appreciable. What I feared to see was the lack of inventiveness, but this film fortunately is anything but repetitive (except for a few aspects) and hauntingly rich in variety and thus offers a lot of innovation for this genre. Another thing that makes this film differ from other entries it is how it allows the threat to only creep in slowly. In the beginning I was thinking ""What kind of damage might a blind and old man probably do to three healthy teenagers with a gun?"" and it shocked me what this man could do despite of his disadvantage. Not only does he have a canine companion that does a lot of work for him, the house the three trespassers are trapped in is still his own territory after all. He learned to live in it despite his missing vision. Just like our protagonist I underestimated his hidden abilities and thus he is an actual threat. The film mostly follows Rocky, superbly portrayed by Jane Levy, and focuses on her as she tries to remain silent and find a way out of the death trap. Like in her first collaboration with Alvarez, she is one of the main factors why this film works out so well. Once again, she shows how talented she is and especially masters the eye game again. Her performance impressively captures the silent terror of this flick and thus brings the horror into effect, in other words, it made me hold my breath for most of the runtime. In the following sequences her fight for survival is the focus and there are several ideas incorporated that exacerbate the whole situation tremendously. Just before you thought she is on the brink of finally escaping her certain death there is something else that thwarts her flight and traps her even more in the house. It is not only the whole atmosphere, but also the antagonist that heavily reminded me of ""Resident Evil 7"" and gave me similar vibes. In some instances, it was sadly predictable and kept me from being surprised, but aside from this it had enough unforeseen features that made it up for it (two words: night vision!). Next to the striking resemblance to the 2017 Koshi Nakanishi game it also pays tribute to classic horror films, such as ""Cujo"" (obviously) and supposedly even ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" (can't tell it in the case of the latter, still have to see it), but allegedly the final reveal is not inferior to the Johnathan Demme classic in terms of how disturbing it is. The blind man keeping the girl who killed his daughter as a hostage and forcing her to bear him a new child? Whatever the director was smoking lead him to a decision that is nothing short of absolutely gross and had an unsettling effect on me. The fact that his behaviour and desperate measures made sense in an insane way didn't make it easier for me. With this devastating realization the movie gains even more tension, as the inconspicuous and innocent man turns out to be an even more dangerous and indescribably threatening maniac. Until the end, he doesn't seem to be willing to stop until he is getting what he desires. Even after the bloodcurdling final act where is defeated and presumably dead, he turns out to be still alive. That leaves me wondering if he is human or actually not something more instead. Another thing I consider to be remarkable is how Rocky managed to escape with the stolen money and starts a new life on a undeniably nefarious basis. Stolen money remains to be stolen money, no matter what kind of pervert is the legitimate owner. It is interesting how the finale subtly establishes her as an antihero and convicts neither the protagonist nor the antagonist for their felonies and thus places both on the same level. Just a small detail, but not less brilliant. All in all, this flick is a surprisingly innovative and intense thriller that establishes its horror with a realistic approach and passes on paranormal factor completely. Admittedly, the film did not impress that much shortly after the credits have rolled, but the more I thought about it the more I was able to take in the ingeniousness that lies out of sight but in hidden details. Furthermore, I enjoyed the character constellation and the personalities behind each and everyone and consider Jane Levy's performance to be a critical factor for this film's success (aside from the dog who is the real MVP) and it makes me kind of sad that she is not starring in any bigger films. In my opinion, she absolutely deserves more recognition. This film is without a doubt original, innovative, and packing, in other words everything a movie of that genre needs. It was indeed a creative venture, but it eventually pays off, as it turns out to be something of its own. Oh, and before I forget: Now that I have seen both Levy/Alvarez collaborations and felt strong ""Resident Evil"" vibes in both, I think it would be a perfect job for him to make a proper adaptation with Levy in the leading role, as she would make an ideal Jill Valentine. With Raimi as the producer, a man who is experienced in this genre and a talented and charismatic lead actress, what could go wrong then? It surely could not be worse than the Anderson abominations. Just saying. Anyway, this film might not be ground-breaking, but is a surprisingly entertaining and decent thriller."
" Liked it but the end ruined it

" it's not the best thriller but it's a good ride with some social commentary
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,7,"Being set in detroit it's no coincidence. one of the cities with more economical problems in us. with industries fading, with people wanting to leave the place. with neighbourhoods that flourished and now are nothing. california might be a dream for some, but it's not hard to understand why people would do stuff like this. i think the movie does give a nice backstory with the characters that meks you more worried about them. plus being set in a city like detroit gives an extra spice for me. the rich/poor gap is actually explored, no matter what some whiny reviewers say.sometimes people want too much explanations: why this why that...and i don't understand. the movie doesn't need to explain everything. i don't even think it requires that much suspension of disbelief but that's me. it's a cool gimmick that the guy is blind because the scenes where they're silenced in the same room as the guy are pretty well made.it's a movie well shot (no shaky cam or constant jump cuts thankfully, and some travellings that actually want you to understand the house of the guy), with good characters and nice acting, that has one or two jump scares, that has extra spice to it (which for me wasn't that necessary) but above all was entertaining and delivered what was promised. you can't say otherwise in my opinion.i don't believe it's an horror classic, also because i found it more in the thriller genre. but ithas really well shot scenes and you can follow clearly th characters, knowing where they are in that period of time, creating creative boundaries for their escape. for me it's simple.: ignore the bad reviews and enjoy the movie. people sometimes want to complain about minor things without getting into the head of the charaters: this situation was completely unexpected for them."
" A different take on an old genre
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,6,Don't Breathe is about three young people from a city neighborhood who break into the house of a blind man and get more than what they expected. It is a film that presents a different take on the edge of your seat horror thriller.This movie makes you feel like you are actually in the movie and participating in it. There is some metaphor used in the movie that I really liked concerning help in time of need too. But there were also a lot of scenes where I wished our main characters had been a bit smarter in how they approached their situations. And there are a lot of scenes where the director seems to forget the main character is a blind man.This is a great horror film that will leave you holding your breath literally at the edge of your seat wondering how it is all going to end. It added a new twist to an old horror genre that I enjoyed.

No character developement what so ever, no deep background stories to make us feel for characters.Good Side is the story excluding characters is pretty well-written and has plot twists. Does a good job keeping you on your toes. Sometimes I realised I was holding my breath with characters as well.

Also, the acting is bad. Really bad. Well, I know that everyone enjoys seeing a thin blonde with big blue eyes, but come one! She was supposed to be an actress, for God's sake!
The other ""good guy"" is even worse, if that is possible. All the acting he does is two things: 1) roll the eyes out; 2) open mouth. That's it. That's all he learnt from the art of acting. Yes, people, it's this simple - roll your eyes and never close your mouth and you will be able play every emotion there is in the world!"

The guy is blind, just find a weapon put the radio on and kill him. If the makers had made it more clear that he had supernatural powers It could have been excusable but overall it didn't make a lot of sense and didn't involve enough violence to make up for it."

Also the blind man must have super powers cause blind people aren't able to do the things this guy does. Plus they had so many chances to kill the blind man realistically even though he's a veteran it would be very easy to kill him but these three morons sneak around the entire time. Crying tripping on crap and making noise constantly. Awful shoehorned in plot trying to be disturbing but it comes off as ""we can't come up with a good story so let's just make the man try to inseminate the hypocritical garbage blond girl with a turkey baster"" it try's way to hard , a pitiful ""villain"", nothing is even slightly scary, the whole movie I was rooting for these idiots to die, and very unlikable characters especially the greedy hypocritical girl character who I wanted to get tortured who sacrifices her friends just to get the money but no she lives of course"
" Full Of Plot Holes + Relies On Jump Scares
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,2,"I don't know how this film is so highly rated. It was terrible. There were so many things wrong with it from the start. There were so many things that happened within the movie that just aren't possible and don't make sense. Like, the kids being faster than a rottweiler. I get that at first the dog was drugged but eventually it wasn't. Rocky wasn't going to outrun that dog. Even if, let's say, she could by some miracle...it'd have gotten her in the car. She wouldn't have been nearly strong enough to trap it after what she'd been through. Plus, the amount of money she was stealing would have weighed at least fifty pounds (if not more) and wouldn't have fit in that tiny backpack. Even if we pretend that it did, how was she going to outrun a dog carrying it?Then we have the fact that a blind man somehow kidnapped a wealthy trust fund girl from her driveway and didn't get caught. How did he do this? What car was he driving? Did he just trick her? No. Not possible. We have the fact that the characters were too dumb to just leave and call the police anonymously. We have the fact that apparently the alarm could disorient the blind dude but that's only ever used as a last resort. We have these kids getting up from injuries that they would not get up from. We have people behaving the exact opposite of how normal humans would definitely behave. The only redeeming quality is SOME scenes were decently shot. Otherwise...why the heck does anyone like this? Don't waste your time."
" Overrated and unoriginal if not well put together
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,7,"From writer/director Fred Alvarez, Don't Breathe is his second feature film. He is quickly gaining a name for himself in horror circles, but I'm not personally convinced it is for the right reasons. His first feature which he also both wrote and directed was the Evil Dead remake, which as a huge fan of the original I was not terribly impressed with despite its plaudits (and you should already be aware of my opinion of pointless remakes). The modern generation really need to start watching films made before the year two thousand.Anyway, in the slums of Detroit, some loser, no-hope kids are getting easy scores by breaking into posh houses. It's easy money for the serial thieves/thrill seekers as one of them has master keys as their targets all use his fathers security company. Convenient huh? And no, not a one of them thinks that eventually it might look a little suspicious. Whatever, moving on. Each one has a sob-story to tell in order to try and make them a little more likeable. Bottom line is, they are dumb waster kids. We don't really care.They get word of an army vet who got a big settlement after an accident involving his daughter. While scouting out the house they realise that their target is blind and decide to hit the house that night thinking it will be simple as, simple be. Unfortunately for them (or fortunately for us), this is one blind army vet who doesn't take being robbed lying down and retaliates with force. That night the kids break in, disable the alarm and then everything starts to go south for them.I will say the film is actually quite entertaining and Stephen Lang (Avatar) as the blind man is certainly the star of the show. He really is menacing and creepy and you're quite happy for him to be dispatching dumb idiot teenagers. The rest of the acting is reasonable but nothing to shout out about. There is also some great atmosphere building along with some good camera effects. The lighting and sound are also above average when so many recent films can't even get these two simple things right. So a major plus there for this feature.To sum up, Don't Breathe is an entertaining and surprisingly well made film with high production values. Despite its rather hysterically positive reception (maybe some folk just don't watch a lot of films), it is ultimately full of the usual old and tired horror cliches which does let the film down. Despite it doing what it does very well, there is nothing really new here on offer but should ultimately satisfy you. Certainly one of the better films of this type.
The Sage's Rating: 7/10"
" A chiller thriller with plently going for it
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,7,Tension can be hard to build in films but this film has it buckets. It's gripping and almost compulsive. The acting by the main protagonist and the antagonist is good. There really isn't a great deal to the story but its anxious and absorbing.
" Mixed feelings
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,4,"Another film where one caracter is nothing but a plot device and continuously begging for death or harming others.Boring ""twist"". Completely cliché and useless. Viewers see it coming a mile away (you'll know it when you see it).saw myself twice looking at the time... and realizing the film should have logically ended (at least) twice already. And the script had to be artificially extended.Obviously, don't watch this for the quality of the script. Or to feel thoroughly suspensed : often times the sillyness of the script breaks immersion.On the other hand, it managed to be tense in those moments where suspension of disbelief was attained. Great start, solid first half of the film. Horrible last quarter."
" A flimsy story at best.
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,3,"There were some great, intense scenes in this movie, but the new trend in movies seems to be having unlikable, stupid, wanna-be cool characters in movies. Even Rocky, who wants to get her sister out of the life they r both living, plans to do it by robbing someone else. As the story changes from robbery to trying to get out alive, why do I care about the characters? They are young, stupid thugs. And the twist of the man having his daughters killer in his basement was just to make him the bad person. Try to get some sympathy for the burglars."
" Not bad but requires some suspension of disbelief to enjoy
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,6,"I actually enjoyed this one but it does fly off into ""ok that doesn't make a lot of sense"" territory sometimes. It definitely requires you to kind of turn off your brain and just accept some things every once in a while.The entire movie happens around one small house and I have to say this was all pretty well done. Everything is set up at the beginning of the movie so you're never left asking, ""Wait why is there a gun under the bed?"" The first half hour or so really does have you on the very edge of your seat wondering what's gonna happen next and a lot of the silent moments throughout the film succeed in making one hold their breath.The characters are all pretty unlikable people but they have their redeeming qualities which, I thought, was actually quite refreshing. They're robbers planning to rob a blind old war veteran, they're SUPPOSED to be bad, unlikable people but we're still supposed to care if they die or not and the film succeeds in creating a bit of sympathy for them. You're left between ""I hope they get out safe"" and ""yeah they deserve what's coming"" a lot of the time. Also, the lack of an ""I've always loved you"" between Rocky and Alex is one cliché I'm happy the filmmakers managed to resist.The pregnant rich woman chained up in the basement seemed a little unnecessary and ridiculous and I personally think the movie could have done without that and the man attempting to impregnate one of the protagonists with a turkey baster. The plot would have been better without adding all that in my opinion. Also some of the blind veteran's lines seemed a little bit silly when it comes time for him to speak.All in all, a decent movie that's definitely enjoyable but has its flaws."
" Exciting

" Boring
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,2,"The scenario is really boring, most of the movie's twists were easily predicted. But people opinions are different, that's why I guess it got 7.1!!"
" Super twisty and amazing
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,10,"Started out thinking ""who breaks into a military vets house and expects it to go well?"" Very suspenseful with tons of twists. My heart was pounding the entire time. I highly recommend this movie if you are looking for a movie to get your heart going. So good!"
" love this movie highly recommend
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,9,"Don't Breathe: That rare modern horror film that uses tension building and atmosphere. With an unsettiling preformance from Stephan Lang and a totaly original story while being full of hitchcocking suspence and twists to create real modern horror, Don't Breathe is that rare modern horor film that succeds Intellectually as well as viscerally.
if you like horror it is a must watch!"
" A fun movie, just don't think logically
",2020-02-21 00:00:00,7,"A lot could be said about this movie about  it shows of a scary blind man, but I really enjoyed it's commercial style of a typical Hollywood thriller/horror movie.Entertaining, fun and just don't think of it logically you will enjoy it!"
" Masterful thrill ride
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,10,"Originally saw in the theater which was glorious! I absolutely love Don't Breathe it's very intense, well filmed, lots of well done suspense, surprises, and very entertaining! I love Jane Levy's beauty of her hair and outfit. I appreciate effed up horror more than most so to me this is a goldmine in the genre."
" WTF. I waited 4 years to watch this!!!
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,4,"First of all, I love Fede Alvarez. He made the evil dead remake - which I thought was brilliant... THIS however, was crap. Ugh. I waited SO long and was SO excited but it farted right on my face!Not to beat around the diarrhoea bush here BUT, This is a perfect example of ""Here's the world, here's it's rules and here's the story.... although, the RULES of which this world is governed by maybe disregarded at a moments notice for story n sh/t"".Couldn't get past it. He has a dogs sense of smell for a plot point but then can't smell anything?It's suggested that he has 'eco location' (or he can just see and it's all a lie) but only for like... once a whenever.Oh, and EVERYBODY, E.E.R.Y.B.O.D.Y is an idiot.
There's lots I could say here, I just don't want to.Love the premise, LOVE THE CAST (mostly. I've seen open house) but this was so full of holes that I am rather annoyed at myself for getting so excited for it.Oh, and the ""protagonists"", the people we're supposed to route for, all horrible. No sympathy for any of them.This is why I hate Christmas as an adult. It's my responsibility to give money to those who haven't earned it."
" Edge of your seat thriller! ( A+ Movie) My Ratings 10/10
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,10,"It kept you on your toes and the whole time your adrenaline was rushing. It was very well acted and felt very real to watch. It was a bit of a wild ending, wasn't my favourite but the acting was amazing."
" Blind vs Stupidity
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,7,Blind vs Stupidity. Excellent horror movie that seems to realistic with a lot of suspense.
" Great idea, too many plot holes
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,5,"This would be great of it wasn't for all the major flaws and plot holes. Some are just lazy and stupid and some holes are so big that the story doesn't even add up anymore. It's a shame, 'cause in many other ways it's a cool and suspenseful flick."
" Awful
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,2,I only watched this until the end because of the good reviews. I wish I hadn't bothered. It's a borefest.
" Good but overrated
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,7,"I don't know if it's just my luck, but I can't find a negative review about this movie. I'm not saying it was bad at all, it just isn't a masterpiece like most people I've seen making it out to be. It's a fun watch, but probably something I wouldn't rewatch. This is all my opinion and you may love love this film. I personally only liked it, not love it"
" Same thing throughout whole movie
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,5,"I am not a fan of this movie.
The thing that made me off is the same thing through the whole movie. Survival in a sadistic veteran's home. Through the whole movie, you can see only one development in plot and it is really not a big deal and ending is just meh. You can not create empathy with the veteran due to his acts. After watching the movie, you put yourself in writer's position and begin to think how to make a better movie by using this good content?Yes the content, the theme is really good but the processing of these elements are just mediocre. 5/10"
" You are gonna hold your breath
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,7,"You will be very nervous and hold your breath while watching this movie. If you like the kind of films that main character does too much effort to escape from a psychopath, then you are gonna love this movie."
" Tense thriller, let down in places
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,6,"Don't Breathe comes across mostly as a clever low-budget thriller with a brilliant set-up which almost works but is ultimately let down by a flawed execution, The initial plot of a trio of house-breakers relying on one of their gang to obtain inside information, and equally importantly keys, to target properties is a good one. Even more so when the latest target is a blind army veteran sitting on a fortune. The drama of this main event starts off well, but the terrific scenes of suspense are undone by inexplicable inconsistencies such as rooms with all windows barred suddenly having a character thrown through one without resistance and the tired old device of a character who clearly should be .dead regaining consciousness at a convenient point. Add this to the veteran's transformation between wily tough guy to complete idiot and a movie that promised to be a 7 or 8 rating ends up a 6. Worth a watch if you can overlook the inconsistencies"
" Idiotic
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,3,"3 idiots break into a blind man's house. They proceed to make a load of stupid decisions and get what they deserve, because the blind man happens to be a bad ass, psycho mofo (who sounds a lot like Bane from Batman).
Just another film that's premise is very unrealistic and just plain stupid; so much so that it's actually entertaining in a comedic way.
Shame one of them survived, i was hoping they'd all bite it."
" Watchable.
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,4,"I mean, all they had to do would be to blast off music loudly from their phones to distract him and take him down. Or, throw stuff at him, or, around the house. Just, make noise. It's bothersome how unrealistically they approached the situation, even thought it's 'just a movie.'"
" The Suspense Is Crazy
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,10,"I watch a lot of movies and 3 minutes in, I can predict if a movie will be bad or not. I had a good feeling about this movie and after watching it, I gotta say, it was great! I loved it. It reached a point, I felt like, between living and the money, the girl always chose the money which didn't make sense to me but aside that, the blind man's relentlessness, the intensity, the suspense, everything was crazy. The house became officially designated as ""No Escape"". This was a great movie. Kudos to the writers, directors, actors and producers."
" Dissapointing
",2019-12-09 00:00:00,5,All three of the morons should have died. Very frustating that one of them survived.
" Good, violent but flawed home invasion/suspense movie
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,7,"Three young, tech savvy burglars break into the home of a blind veteran, who has a stash of cash. They think he should be an easy target but he is more than capable of defending himself - and he harbours a very dark secret!
Effective home invasion/horror movie. It's well acted, has great cinematography, suspenseful and is very violent. But if is far from perfect. For a start, who are we meant to root for? Who is the victim here? Thieves versus crazy psycho. This dilemma bothered me throughout, and I can't say that I was pleased with the ending (not giving it away!). As mentioned our robbery victim is blind yet he is able to carry out tasks that just simply would not possible by himself. And another thing that really annoyed me was one of the robbers, a slightly built young man, endures multiple beatings and injuries yet he appears to possess amazing recovery powers!
Flaws aside this is a good, solid movie, it has just the right running time and plenty of action. This is strong stuff which may prove too much for more sensitive viewers."
" Don't Breathe by I.M. Nosferatu #Nosferreview
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,9,"Despite the title, you can breathe - I saw Don't Breathe and I'm telling you that you can take a deep breath. Don't get me wrong, it didn't suck. In fact, it was quite good as a genre piece. I'd even say that the set up and first forty-five minutes were Ripper smooth and reached a level just below Krugerian in nature. Indeed, the basic plot was somewhat unique and obviously a primary factor in leading to an 85% audience score on ""Rotten Tomatoes.""It's the old Robin Hood story with a couple of Hitch twists. Three delinquents break into houses and steal valuables from the rich to sell to their slimy fence. The fence comes up with an easy mark for the post-pubescent robber-barons. It seems a former veteran's daughter was killed in a car accident and the veteran received a million dollar settlement. Why anyone would think that the vet would keep the money in his house stretches credibility? But okay, I'll bite. Oh, I forgot to mention, the vet is blind and lives in a hovel with a dog that could have played Cujo. So the deed goes down and our Robin Hoods manage to break into the house, quell Cujo, and sedate the blind man - or do they? That is the million dollar question. The tables quickly turn and like the film Extremities, the questions of who is captor and who is prey become muddy at best.One of the main reasons why this film succeeds is the sick acting. Veteran character actor Stephen Lang, who has a resume longer than the river Styx, rises to the level of Jasonian in terms of his acting. He came to prominence for most mortals as Colonel Miles Quaritch in Avatar (he also was the voice of the same character in the video game). But I remember his stunningly ill performance as Ike Clanton in 1993's Tombstone about Wyatt Earp (the one with Kurt Russell, not Kevin Costner). Jane Levy is devilishly good as Rocky, the female bandito of the group with a heart of gold (she wants the money so she can save her young sister from her demented mother). Seriously sick performances also are turned in by Dylan Minnette as Alex (from Goosebumps) and Daniel Zovatto as Money (from Fear the Walking Dead). Special fang bites (real ones in this case) go to the Dog who apparently was played by three different canines - Astor, Athos & Nomad.The film was penned by Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues and more than capably directed by Mr. Alvarez. No stranger to the horror genre, Mr. Alvarez has amassed such horror credits as the 2013 Evil Dead and the 2009 Panic Attack. He knows how to give good scare.As I said, the set-up was Ripper smooth. After forty-five minutes, however, the film falls into general horror formulaic patterns (which isn't a bad thing for genre fans). I should note that there is one part that jumps the shark so badly that even Darth Vader (Lord of shark jumping) would cringe under his oxygen mask. But overall, the story moves briskly to its predictable but satisfying ending. Wish I could say more, but spoilers aren't my thing.The boffo box office and almost unanimous acceptance by both audiences and critics alike has to be due to the slick marketing scheme offered by the marketing wizards. There's no doubt that Don't Breathe is a sick horror film worthy of multiple fangs-for-the-memories - but 85% on the tomato meter? Most horror films don't break 50%. And that's because from the looks and plot summary it appears - at least on the surface - that it's a psychological suspense thriller as opposed to purely a horror offering. So it's a fake left go right, or to use an advertising analogy, a bait and switch. Muggles are attracted to the film thinking it's more of a mainstream piece and then get sucked into the horror genre vortex. Probably most of these types are so virginal that they don't even realize they are watching standard horror fare.At any rate, I deem it a horrifically well-made film worthy of viewing by both genre fans and the uninitiated. I give it my I.M. Nosferatu Medal of Honor. From its reception, I am certain that more breath will be pumped into Don't Breathe sequels."
" Disgusting
",2019-11-23 00:00:00,1,Three hoodlums break into the home of a blind war hero and steal all his money and this film portrays them as victims?! What the hell is the world coming to when people think this is somehow entertaining? It's an absolute disgrace and everyone involved in the making of this film ought to be imprisoned for inciting violence and criminal activity.
" Plot holes, plot holes everywhere
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,4,"I guess the title says it all. Too many plot holes to make this movie a little bit credible. Some of the characters could have been worked better, given a bit more of background but it is quite the opposite. The ending is dull and predictable.
Overall it is a movie to be seen with very low expectations otherwise you might notice all the flaws and they are many"
" Who is the bad guy?
",2019-11-20 00:00:00,7,"This is a good movie! I I'm doubt who is the bad guy, the old man or the robbers? In general, I've liked this movie, but I expected a turnaround. Almost everything that happened in this movie, I've expected."
" Could've been better
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,6,"If they didn't have the twist to the story and changed the ending then it would have been an excellent story. Not a fan of the direction the story went about half way through/to the end. The acting was very well done though, with a different script I would have put this as an 8 or maybe even a 9."
" Once in a life time
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,10,A once in a life time movie a new type of horror never seen before simply it's holding the breath what a masterpiece ...
" Garbage.
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,3,"Maybe I could've liked this film if it had some redeeming value, but it doesn't. This is one of those films where none of the characters are protagonists. Three twenty somethings decide to rob a blind war veteran who lives in an abandon, dilapidated neighborhood with no neighbors. We're supposed to feel sorry for the female of the group because she needs the money for her and her daughter. But by the end of the seriously contrived plot, I didn't like her either. I won't put spoilers in here except to say you've seen some version of this, ""oh-no! It's worse than I expected!"" plot before."
" Excellent suspense horror/thriller
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,8,"Honestly think this film was brilliant. Stephen Lang puts in the performance of his career as the potentially iconic blind man, Jane Levy plays possibly my favourite final girl of the past 2 decades, she has relatable motive and is played flawlessly. Dylan Minnette was another nice surprise in this film, once again his character is quite relatable and you start to feel sorry for his character once you realise he's only roped himself into what he does for a girl that will never love him back. The cinematography is possibly the thing that holds this film together though. 99% of the film takes place within the house and as a result we get some very claustrophobic and clever camera work. Overall I think this is easily one of the better horror films in recent years and has earned itself a place on my Blu-Ray shelf."
" Daredevil vs stupid thieves
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,6,"Three uncharismatic thieves break into the house of a blind old man after they discover he's got a fortune as a compensation for the murder of his daughter; but little they knew that the blind old man is an older and superpowered evil version of Daredevil (the man has superstrenght, can teleport, is a gun expert, is unkillable...).
If you let this nonsense (and an incredible amount of other script problems) you'll find in Don't Breathe a short, well crafted, suspenseful horror thriller with an amazing performance by Stephen Lang as the blind man that will give you some chills."
" ""You Understand Nothing!""...
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,8,"In DON'T BREATHE, a trio of burglars (Rocky- Jane Levy, Alex- Dylan Minnette, and Money- Daniel Zovatto) go for one last, big break-in, so that they can ""retire"" / escape the urban hell they live in (the exteriors in this film are shots of Detroit in full decrepitude and decay). It all seems easy enough, perhaps, too easy. Once inside the house, everything hits the fan.Suspenseful and full of surprises, this movie provides almost non-stop thrills, chills, and gasp-out-loud moments! Sort of WAIT UNTIL DARK meets PANIC ROOM, with nods to everything from SILENCE OF THE LAMBS to CUJO, DB manages to be absolutely original in spite of its influences. Ms. Levy is tremendous in her desperate role, and Stephen Lang is mesmerizing as the sole occupant of the chosen domicile. Watch this ASAP!..."
" Well deserved 1 Star
",2019-10-07 00:00:00,1,"Another movie which tries to be ""deep"" and ends up a massive disaster. The plot is full of holes & in the end the evil gold-digger wins.Characters are totally unlikable & the winner makes you mad! Actually if the blonde girl had died and the story was believable it would probably be a decent movie."
" Escapism...you betcha
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,5,"Having read these mixed reviews but only after seeing the film, I share a similar reaction-negative and positive. Plot holes yes, farfetched, muddled, murky reality, lazy explanations, gratuitous gore, unlikeable characters (all but one*) behaving badly, a wild twist, sloppily resolved. Yet for 88 minutes I remained on the edge of wherever I first landed when the movie began. I didn't move or speak until the last segment when I started shouting at the characters who were left. *Rocky was sensational in an almost comical horror flick that didn't feel like wasted time for me."
" This movie is plain stupid
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,1,"I would put a stamp ""somehow plausible"" on this movie in the beginning but that wouldn't hold much longer after it got so ridiculous towards the middle that I rather spared my precious time by turning it off.It is true that you have to like or somehow identify with the characters in order to really live the horror and this movie offered a very interesting twist: What if you actually liked also the character causing the horrible things happen? Reading the film's description, I expected a poor (but not exactly when he gets triggered) old vet who is forced to defend himself, and because it is dark and he's on his own battlefield, gives hell to the perpetrators. But they give us a guy who is a total monster and whom I would kill myself and then burglars, who try to justify their crimes by pretending to be some kind of modern Robin Hoods. They are such an unbelievable bunch of characters and their hope, that if they steal enough money, their lives will change, is ridiculous. So you have nobody left you can root for and therefore you don't care that much what happens to them, so you are basically left with jump scares and nonsensical plot.Because what sense does it make to do houses, steal under 10k, sell the stolen stuff below the market price to a guy who takes 40% for him, and divide it between 3 people? After a few houses, wouldn't the police see the pattern considering the security installations are always the same? Fast forward to the house: Why is the old guy able to magically sniff out shoes but totally misses persons moving next to him, sweating and doing noise in the process? I know that blind people's senses sharpen so that they can eg. tell you what liquor is inside a bottle that just fell to a ground, so that doesn't sound particularly hard. And speaking about blindness, how the hell do you abduct a girl from rich neighborhood, prepare her this harem and never do a mistake such that she can escape, being blind?? And what kind of BS is this idea of impregnating her so that he can have his daughter again?Needless to say, this was the moment where I quit. I rarely don't make it to the end but this movie just managed to persuaded me that I have my laundry to do. Avoid if you can."
" Just really bad and made no sense!
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,2,"One of the worst movies ever. Didn't make any sense at all. There's no way an old, blind man could pull this off all by himself. I just got annoyed watching it and I recommend that you don't waste your time on it. The only reason I gave it two stars was because there was a dog in it, and I love dogs. That's all I have to say."
" A horror film with an original story and premise
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,7,"Horror isn't really the genre known for its pallet of original, innovative movies but ""Don't Breathe"" is one of them. It's basically a home invasion movie with a twist, three young people break into a blind army veterans home to steal money but it all turns into a nightmare as they are trapped in there and have to fight for their life. ""Don't Breathe"" is a horror flick with - aside from a unique story - some good acting, especially from Stephen Lange and Dylan Minnette. While it becomes slightly repetitive in the end, the film is still a good thriller/horror with jump scares, thrills, and disturbing twists."
" The Tension Keeps Building Until The Very End
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,8,"This is a very intense thriller that builds in tension from beginning to end.The opening scene grabs your attention and has you intrigued, and the movie definitely delivers throughout, but especially with its surprising twist.Highly recommended and worth the watch."
" Don't Hold Your Breath
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,5,"Don't Breathe is the story of a small gang of criminals with a proclivity for B&E who set their sights on the home of a blind man. They think the disabled vet will be an easy mark, that is until he turns the tables on them and the hunters become the hunted.God, if that was the movie I would have enjoyed it more. Instead we get the above with a twist. The poor, old, blind vet is actually a twisted sadist fond of torture and pseudo rape. So he's not exactly a sympathetic burglary victim.While they make the victim into a monster, they try to turn the criminals sympathetic. This shift in morality was likely meant to be compelling and norm-busting but instead it makes me long for what could have been, because there are interesting things here. The movie manages some good tension and interesting moments playing off the blind character angle.It's worth a watch but it may be more enjoyable if you don't look too close."
" A movie that makes so much sense.
",2019-09-10 00:00:00,7,"I often find myself criticizing movies details, like ""why would this character do that and not that"" but this movie made sense all 88 minutes for me. All the decisions made by the characters were understandable which is something hard to find in most movies, sometimes they have to force an doubtful action on a character for the movie to go where the director wants it to go, but not this one. I was hooked from beginning to end."
" A really messed up movie
",2019-09-06 00:00:00,5,"This movie had great premise. The plot intrigued me and the thought of the supposedly vulnerable victim turning the tables appealed. Then it all went wrong. Without giving away spoilers they ruined it. You found yourself rooting for the burglars which should never be the case, by the end I wanted all the characters to die. One scene is shocking and could only have been added for the shock factor, it was unnecessary. Should have just kept it simple as victim fighting back. Swerve."
" Don't Breathe

" Terrible.

" The most unlikeable characters in any horror movie
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,3,I was surprised to read such positive reviews for this movie because I honestly found it to be one of the worst I've seen in a long time the so called victims in this movie break into people's homes and steal from there own family for there own selfish agendas they decide they haven't quite stolen enough so they decide to break into a blind mans house and steal money he got in a settlement for his daughter being killed then the story is flipped when he kills one of the intruders and the remaining two discover he has kidnapped the young rich girl who accidentally ran down his daughter and paid him off and that he has forced the girl to give him a new baby by way of insemination they try to help her and she is killed by him accidently after shooting blindly at the intruders he then disposes of her body and goes back after the other two and even after all this they don't alarm the police because they want to escape with the money and not go to jail for breaking and entering so instead they play a cat and mouse game around the house the girl gets caught and he attempts to do the same to her as he did to the other girl but she is saved and they reach a deal with the murdering kidnapping rapist to not tell anyone anything if they can keep the money but once they try to leave he kills one of them and the young girl sets off his intruder alarm deafening him then beats him with a hammer and escapes with the money she doesn't stay and inform the police of what has happened instead she runs away with the money and tells nobody what happened but later finds out the guy got away with it all after the police find him barely alive and he is credited for killing the intruders and they somehow don't question his basement torture chamber and a half destroyed house full of blood and bullets.Not a single character in this movie is likable or redeemable the only victim is the young girl who was kidnapped by the father of the girl she run down with her car by accident who didn't go to prison because she paid off the father who accepted the offer instead of taking it to court and putting her in jail it's very difficult to enjoy a movie where you just want all involved to die by the end of movie.I don't recommend this movie to anyone unless all your looking for is a bunch of characters with little morals and a few shock value scenes with a disappointing ending.

" Good intense movie
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,8,"I was expecting this to be a horror movie, but it isn't as there's barely any scary moments. However, I still enjoyed the movie as the plot was very intriguing and it was full of intense moments which made the movie very thrilling. There's also a few twists in the movie which makes a bit more interesting even if it does or doesn't help which side you're supporting in the story. Apparently there's going to be a sequel for this movie which is interesting, and I hope its as good as this."
" my notes
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,6,"Good, fun and effectively suspenseful and tense movie. well directed. good premise utilized well. but there were a bunch of questionable parts (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
some questionable parts were how the dog was able to push him through the window if there were bars, how they showed the guy getting stabbed with garden scissors but then wasn't stabbed later, can't remember the others. and i didn't really like the ending, i get that his hearing is probably highly sensitive so the alarm might be disorienting, but he's been firing a gun inside a house the whole movie, that's way louder than an alarm, which causes him to completely lose his composure. this probably would have been a 3.5 without these turn-offs"

" Perfect directing and tension thriller. I missed something, but it was great
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,8,"Imagination to use every single way to create tension through the movie in every single scene (once the action starts).The movie is short and doesn't try to do more than it should.

The characters are beyond shallow, which again, it doesn't ""really"" matter, but could've used just a bit more depth. There is no point, really. Not even a thin one.Saw: Revenge; Serial Killer with an ideology; Irony of life (survives a suicide attempt, yet the cancer can't be cured).
Last House on the Left; Spit over your Grave: Over the top Revenge against sexual crimes.

" Intense and mostly great
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,8,"The best things about this movie are the acting and the pacing. Three characters, one female and two males, decide to rob a blind man. I seem to remember that the blind man had been in the military years before but I'm not positive on that. The blind man became a total recluse after his daughter was killed and there are rumors that he has a bunch of money in his home somewhere. The thieves think they can just knock him out with some kind of gas and take the money easily. They're obviously very wrong. Unlike some other reviewers, I don't feel like we're supposed to like or root for the thieves all that much. The female character maybe, but even then only somewhat in the beginning to make us care about what happens to her later on. This made it better for me because I was on the blind man's side throughout the movie until the reveal that he was keeping a woman prisoner because he blamed her for his daughter's death. I loved that reveal because it changed my opinion so quickly and I wasn't expecting it at all. I could have done without the blind man trying to impregnate the woman and later the thief but I appreciate that he wasn't literally raping anyone because that wouldn't have fit with his character at all. Also, I loved the scenes with the dog in the car and I appreciate that the dog wasn't killed."
" An old man of age 64 VS. 3 young adults with IQ 64 (combined)
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,3,"3 young adults who are robbers, decide to rob an old man who is an army vet. He's blind alright? So these robbers go for robbing a couple hundred thousand dollars, which the old man keeps in his house in a safe that he bought online at Amazon (look it up... its the same safe) instead of depositing it in a bank like.. you know.. us poor people?? These robbers have robbed multiple homes before but with all the expertise they have, they bring in no bolt cutters or lock pickers or heck, simple screw drivers even (to unscrew the bolts on the lock pads people.. its simple.. really). instead the smartest one of all three brings a gun to ""pop open the locks like a gangsta"". unfortunately, for our tough guy, the only thing that pops properly is his head. once the smartest of the lot dies, the combined IQ of these 3 morons drops even below 64. so they dont decide to run or bash through the windows. or hit the old man with many many objects lying around them.this is one of those movies with high rating but low material. no good story and no good dialogue. no good acting and even at just 1 hr 30 mins, i couldnt handle it totally. i left it at 50% approx. its so bad. there are movies like LOTR running at close to 4 hours which you can see without getting bored. and then there is this.""don't breath""?? More like "" don't watch""! haha
yup.. that joke was lame. just like the movie."

" No way
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,1,I thought Don't Breathe was pretty suspenseful at first but as the movie went on I really started to hate the characters. Especially the beta guy who wanted to get into the pants of the girl. But they're all unlikable.The entirety of the plot would never happen either. The guy is blind. Come on! I know movies are supposed to take us away but there needs to be some level of believably since it's grounded in reality.I'm disappointed.

The premise was A+, acting was very good for the most part, and all in all it was extremely scary for a movie that isn't really good vs evil. I'd highly recommend it."
" They open the basement too soon!
",2019-05-31 00:00:00,5,"What can I say? Overall, this's actually not a bad movie, but, you know, not interesting to me as well.
One blind man with those strength, as a villain. And the thiefs, especially the girl, she got her own story and reason to do, whatever, stealling.
We have so many situations from that source, horrify silence moments, to develop, but the movie lack them.
Also the basement keep secrets was opened too soon, and so we all know everything.
And all the characters only have one mission, not run away out of the house, but, run to the door or sth, to be captured. too predictable.
The only thing I like from the movie is acting of the girl and the blind man, so good acting.
There're one character has a interesting story but they missed it, that's Alex's dad. I hoped they develop his story but no, they didn't
SO THIS IS JUST AN ACCEPTABLE HORROR MOVIE, WITH GOOD ACTING AND SIMPLE STORY. No more, no less.
Ps: They should let the moment chasing each other in the dark longer, and that moment at the very end with more characters."

The burglars broke into the blind man's house to steal the cash he got which he got as a compensation from the government. A blind man isn't easy to steal from and a blind man isn't a saint. The burglars turns out to save their life from the blind man. It's a must watch.

" Predictable

Because of the title I thought the movie will be more like ""Don't breathe so he can't know where we are"" type of movie, instead the characters clearly are moving and BREATHING in front of him. I was hoping the characters would evolve and get experience to fight against him, too bad they were running around the house like headless chickens.Some scenes are quite lame. Movie brought nothing new."
" Don't Bother
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,2,"May contain mild spoilers: There isn't much more I can add about this travesty that hasn't already been said, but given the urge I'm about to do it anyway.
For me, the most important element of a film is a relatable protagonist. It will stand or fall depending on whether or not I care about the main character(s), and/or what becomes of them by the film's conclusion. Cinematography, direction, acting, and even script are secondary. A good example of a well made film with an irredeemable protagonist would be 'Saturday Night, Sunday Morning' by Karel Reisz, starring Albert Finney as Arthur Seaton; a loutish factory worker you wouldn't trust to look after your goldfish, who shoots air guns at old ladies, carries on with his workmate's missus, getting her pregnant in the process, and while he does receive the inevitable, well deserved beating from his mate's brothers, he learns nothing from the ordeal and still gets to skip away into the sunset with Shirley Anne Field. This, therefore, loses the film points for me. I know it's subjective but that's how I work.Here, in 'Don't Breathe', we have an even less redeemable character whom we are presumably supposed to be rooting for even prior to the reveal that the person standing in her way, an OLD BLIND MAN that she, along with her wannabe gangsta boifrend and her useful friendzoned beta intend to BURGLE, isn't such a savoury character himself. But by then it was far too late, I'd already taken sides, and even though I was supposed to now wish him a slow painful death for his admittedly warped reaction to his daughter being killed, I wanted exactly the same fate to befall our thieving little trailer trash heroine. Right until the bitter end (yes I did stick it out in the vain hope that I'd get my wish), I was rooting for the old man and his dog all the way.But of course, our cute little misunderstood house invader gets not only what she came for but three times the amount! Seeing as she no longer has to split it with her now dead colleagues...and of course, she gets to fly off into the sunset without a care in the world, leaving four dead bodies in her wake.But wait! The fourth, the old blind guy, isn't dead after all! Leaving this horrible enterprise ripe for a sequel.You can see it now. Our cute little bikinied heroine whose crimes we are meant to overlook because she's cute and looks good in a bikini, lying on Malibu beach sucking pina coladas out of a coconut shell, her cute little sister building sandcastles and pestering her for ice-cream, she turns around and then suddenly THERE HE IS! Dark glasses, flip flops, Hawaiian shirt. His loyal Rottweiler panting away happily by his side. The camera zooms in on her pretty little face, a bead of sweat running down the side as she removes her shades and utters but one word, ""How?""My thoughts exactly. 1 out of ten, 2 for effort."
" Incredibly intense
",2019-05-07 00:00:00,9,"This movie is very scary, it's too late now but this is one of those movies you must see in theatres. The tension is almost unbearable. And with characters you care about and are rooting for you'll be holding your breath right until the end, this movie sticks to its title promise ""don't breathe""."
" Better than ""Evil Dead"" remake a bad-ass home invasion horror film
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,9,"Yes I enjoy this film, I wouldn't call it best horror film, but decent, cause I seen ton's of better horror films. Don't Breathe (2016) is a home invasion about three Young thieves (Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto) who break in to home of a blind man (Stephen Lang) and are now fighting for their lives. The Blind man is a Iraq Gulf War Veteran in which a rich girl hit and killed his daughter and did not go to prison. Rocky (Jane Levy) is deseperate to get the money for her younger sister that she is abused from her mother. She has to fight for her life.I love ""Don't Breathe"" from Fede Alvarez better than Evil Dead remake the film has similarity to The People Under the Stairs, The Collector and The Collection which are about Home Invasions horror rated-R films. Jane levy was terrific as Rocky the main heroine she did everything to stay alive and fight for her life. You have even a doberman dog in which he chases Rocky and try's to eat her.The blind men (Stephen Lang) is a sick creepy pervert who has a dark secret in a basment. I have this movie on a Blu-ray disc. Don't Breath is a good movie, I wish their would be more booby traps set in the house like were in Friday the 13th (2009) remake, The People Under the Stairs and The Collector. The blind man wears two guns Beretta 92FS and Colt Python and shots to kill his intruders.A really good creative visual scary horror film, well paced flick. It goes fast around, I enjoy it. I love Rocky and Stephen Lang's characther. I recomend this film to any horror fan. I love the film it is worth of watch. Some horror films now days suck I hate It Follows to death and I hate ""The House on the Left (2009)"" remake to death! This movie is good worth of watch, recommened it."
" Decent
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,7,"This is one of those movies that works well with a limited cast and setting, as a team of teenaged thieves break into a blind man's house to steal his substantial fortune. Problem is, he is not as helpless as he seems, nor is anything else about his house, and they wind up in a horrendous situation. A decent story with good suspense and characters, this movie is well done with a good villain and ending.*** out of ****"

Nevertheless I was quite satisfied by this claustrophobic battle where we find no one is all good or all bad.This will make you squeamish and toward the end actually manages to be the movie is thinks it is."

" Don't Bother
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,6,"I only gave this movie a 6 instead of a 5 because the first half has some fine set-pieces, and the use of interiors is pretty solid and engaging. Otherwise, I was heavily disappointed by this one. If this is the best horror movie in twenty years as the critics so claim, then that means horror is in a worse place than I could have ever imagined. Mediocrity should not be considered exceptional.The biggest problem is that the main characters are just plain unlikable and the filmmakers clearly want us to root for them, particularly Rocky. However, I found her motivation far too shallow and flimsy, and her willingness to steal from a poor old blind man (before she knows about the rape dungeon in his basement) just so she and her kid sister can get to California to be, well, not justifiable given what she does know.This would not be a problem if DON'T BREATHE was content to be a sleazy, fast-paced shocker, but it wants our hearts too and I just could not get invested in these people. Either make this more morally ambiguous, or make both the thieves and the blind man awful. The film tries to have both and it just fails dramatically.By the end, the movie is just a shallow series of haunted-house bumps in the night and I just wanted it over. Yes, it's paced well, the cinematography is impressive, but when I don't care about a single thing happening onscreen, then what's the point?"

" Suspenseful, entertaining, frustrating, and dumb at times.
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,4,"This little horror flick has its moments, it successfully creates a suspenseful atmosphere and was well shot, with some masterful camera work.However, the storyline was barebones yet cluttered. Too much was set to accomplish, when less could've been more. Trying to force morally ambiguous decisions onto the viewer, and failed attempts at character development and moments that were meant to make the viewer ""sympathize"" with the ""heroine"".The progression was so frustrating, because we're expected to sympathize with this woman and her reasons behind theft, yet she's as hypocritical as any other villain, and even worse; she does NOTHING but be a burden to the other characters. Also, we were given an ambiguous ending in which we're supposed to feel relieved that she survived and was able to fulfil her ""relatable and human"" goals, when she didn't think twice about stealing from a blind man, begging for her life after she tried to kill him and assaults him again, oh and did I mention that she was never in any real danger?These writers need to have a look at the South Korean film ""The Chaser"", to see how a ""morally ambiguous"" film should be done."
" The atmosphere is very good
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,7,"The atmosphere is very good. There aren't many surprising sections, but it's very thrilling. At the same time, I want to know what will happen next. Coupled with the contrast of the rhythm change, the case of the underground prisoner, and the bright pin and needle, all bring a fresh wind to the horror film. Of course, there are also shortcomings: the picture is too dark; the sense of terror is greatly diluted after more fighting in the later stage; although different perspectives have the effect of climax, but the cohesion between the plots is not smooth enough."
" A Nerve, But Overall Dumb movie.
",2019-02-21 00:00:00,6,"'Don't Breathe' was enjoyable, but it suffers from ""Dumb Characters Doing Dumb Things At The Worse Time"" syndrome. Also, characters just won't die - Throw them through a 2nd story window, shoot them, stab them in the chest with a pair of garden sheets, they ain't dying. The twist is very stupid, and unrealistic. The characters are unlikable. The old man's backstory is a great idea, just poorly executed. But hey, It's certainly not boring."
" One of the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,1,"You can guess every single next scene in this movie. This house full of tools where nobody can get out, with this blind man who ""sees"" everything and pops everywhere is just more funny than scary. Even blind, this guy should have been sent alone to Irak, he would have won the war.Now give this crowbar to anyone with arms, hands and equipped with a brain, he should get out in 5 secs chrono. The rest is just a waste of time."
" An intense thriller with pale ending
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,8,Now this is what you calls a thriller with a gripping storyline and gluing suspense. The film is a story of 3 teenagers who burgled into a home of blind war veteran.

First of all, I can't believe the high scores this movie is getting, maybe for the acting in and of itself?This is by far, one of the worst horror/thriller movies I have ever seen. I coin myself as the queen of terrible horror/thriller movies, it's about all I ever watch and this one might take the cake. The only worse movie I have seen is ""Knock Knock"" and at least that one has the decency of having terrible reviews.It's inconceivable to me how well this movie has rated and is actually the only reason I made an IMDB account.There is nothing clever about this movie, we are briefly introduced to three thieves with zero to no character development, I guess I am supposed to feel sorry for the main girl because her mom uses her? Too bad she is using that as an excuse to be a criminal and steal from people. Would have rathered her be a prostitute as her mom suggested, at least both parties are willing.Then all three of these people break into the house of a blind veteran, pretty messed up. To make up for that we find out he is holding a woman in his basement who he has kept there to try to fill the void of the daughter that she killed.This is the most vapid story line I have ever encountered and I am so mad that it had such good scores. If the scores at least matched how terrible this movie was, I wouldn't be here writing this.PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, or if you do, at least be prepared for what awaits you."

",2019-01-10 00:00:00,8,"Introducing a creative new thriller/horror of 2016! Our film is about 3 thieves and their newly selected victim. The trio of thieves choose to break into a house during the night, having chosen the house of a blind man. The man also lives alone. Their goal is to rob him of his large fortune, however, their new mystery victim (aka the blind man) isn't as helpless as they all assumed.One of the best highlights from this film is it doesn't require a great deal of story or information in order to get the film going. Within a matter of minutes we are introduced to our 3 thieves (with brief stories where required) and then boom, we are taken straight into a very dark thrill ride. While films like this cannot elicit much discussion on my behalf (due to spoilers ), I will suggest when viewing this film to simply watch it with your lights turned off and be generous with your surround sound system. The film only has a small fist full of actors, but when it comes to sound mixing, in this film you really notice every bit of detail coming from the victim's home- floor creaking, glass breaking, guns firing, tools dropping- it's all here and the house sounds alive.Actor Stephen Lang plays 'The Blind Man'. While I'm very familiar with his acting career, he is mostly known as the lead villain in 2009's Avatar (or a couple of B Graded films in the past). This was a new take for this actor. At times it didn't even require him to speak in the film and he provided a strong presence on screen.Director Fede Alvarez, I'll admit, is new to me, unless you're personally a fan of the new remake of Evil Dead 2013 where he also worked with Sam Raimi by his side as one of the producers. The two of them work together again in this film, and their style was new to me. This film is very dark, gritty and aims to make the audience squirm. The director is taking full advantage of all aspects that can be used.Don't Breathe is something I enjoyed a lot, mostly due to its creativity but also because of how much it surprised me- it wasn't a predictable film (unlike many of the horror films in 2016). Just when I thought something frighting was over, I would find myself wrong and it is a great, fun thrill. Don't Breathe is highly recommend for horror and thriller fans. Well that's if you dare to watch it, lol.8.5/10

" Don't watch it!
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,5,"It's just another victim turns to a bad guy movie. 3 people got ambushed by a blind man and acted so stupidly that even though they had hundreds of chances to kill him or get away, two of them ended up dead and of course the pretty girl run away. Just a waste of time, don't watch it."
" Absolutely brilliant
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,8,Wow very intense movie. I actually thought I was there in ten house. I just couldn't keep my eyes of my TV screen.
" I think it's a great thriller film.
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,10,I don't know who is telling that this movie ain't good. But I loved the movie.
" Cheap and unpolished, still suspenseful and entertaining.
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,6,"For honesty and coherence's sake I'll start off by saying I gave Don't Breathe a 6 out of 10. It's compelling, keeps you on edge and at times truly shocking without allowing itself to be pulled into anything too cliché. Pretty much all the makings of a decent modern Horror film not dealing with the supernatural, definitely achieving its initially set goals both story-wise and cinema-wise.Having said that, the film is (in my humble opinion of course, feel more than free to disagree) quite frankly cheap and enjoyable despite it, not due to it. First, the cheap psychological trick of presenting the villains (no, they are NOT anti-heroes, simply a bunch of misfit delinquents forming a street gang of egotistical spoiled brats) as the protagonists from the exposition to the very end. Three jerks who decide to break into a war veteran and bereaved father in order to rob him of his settlement funds (his sole livelihood), and the audience is coerced into sympathizing with them on account of the female coming from a messed up home with an abusing mother and the male being a slightly dorky ""good guy"" in love with her. The screen time they are given achieved the effect of making us (or me at least) secretly (or not quite so) root for them despite them being the obvious bad guys from the get go.Second, the fear and shock factors are as cheap as they come. Jump scares as the only truly ""frightening"" feature. Dark secrets revealed which flip the script and imply that there are no good guys in this film (so much for the film avoiding clichés). And my favorite - the ""antagonist"" (again, a 50+ year old veteran protecting his house and wealth from a bunch of no good would be burglars) being a hybrid of Superman and God, easily able to overpower a youngster half his age and twice his size, survive two hammer swings hitting him straight on the back of the head and escape handcuffs. Perhaps this was a supernatural Horror film after all.Third, the sheer stupidity of certain scenes for the sake of the plot instead of choosing one of a million other more authentic and realistic options. Like the war veteran suddenly losing his accuracy and missing the kid he tries stabbing with garden shears when he's literally on top of him, moments after he was able to track said kid using his hearing alone and hit him with a pistol bullet form the other end of the hall. The bullet of course didn't kill the kid, as that would have made far too much sense. That's not just foolish, it's cheating.Yes, the film is fun to watch even if you aren't able to ignore all those blunt shortcomings. It's suspenseful and keeps you guessing and hoping. Some scenes are truly shocking regardless of being cheap and overall result is definitely worth watching. Just please don't be fooled by the relatively high score Don't Breathe has received here on IMDB (yes, that's pretty high, people here get a kick out of trashing excellent Horror films) and don't expect 2016's Horror masterpiece. Aside from the great acting nothing about this film should have been as it was, and it wouldn't have been all that challenging to make it better or at least less cheap."
" The Best Thriller Of All Time!!!
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,10,This is literally the definition of thrill! It is a sure shot masterpiece.
" A different type of horror movie
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,8,"Don't Breathe does a great job of creating suspense, even if it may fall short in other areas. This movie requires some suspension of disbelief, but, honestly, what horror film doesn't? The story feels original, the acting is good and it gave me the chills multiple times. In short, this is worth a watch if you want to be entertained by a different type of scary movie."
" This movie destroyed my day
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,1,This movie delivers the worst morality I ever seen. It made me sick and pissed off!
" Very good
",2018-12-11 00:00:00,8,"This movie completely shocked me at how good it was. I don't even think I had heard of it and went in with no expectations. That always seems to help, but even if I had high hopes for it, it would not of disappointed. I highly recommend everyone rent this one!"
" Unexpected and thrilling to watch

" Good acting, bad plot
",2018-11-30 00:00:00,2,"There are sooooooo many logical errors in this. He csnt hear people speaking, but noises of the floor or breathing upstairs he notices....
he can smell that there where someone elses shoes in the house, but what about shampoo, perfume or soap?? Its just a mess all around. Tjey should have decided whether too mske the movie as silente as possible, or a speedy action thriller."
" Cringy
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,5,"Although the concept seems good, there were just too many cringey and cliche moments. The dialogue between the main characters seemed designed to try to be edgy. All it achieved was uncomfortable. The fact that people were killed, but then came back over and over again was just a little too much. Especially the bad guy, who just apparently could not be killed by any means. Would not watch this one again."
" Wait what!!!!
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,6,"Is is the same film I was hoping for and curious to watch since I watched it's trailer (2 weeks ago)?
A feel of disappointment or .... actually a disappointment as I just waited for some HORROR move till the end but .... .....
..
6 stars are just for the THRILLER Genre"
" I can't believe that I'm just now writing this
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,9,"I saw this movie in the theater when it came out. In my opinion, it was the best movie of 2016. Edge of your seat intensity.
Now that it's over 2 years later, I just happened to think that I never posted how much I loved it.
Great flick. I bought it when it came out on dvd also."
" Don't Hold Your Breath
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,3,"Over the past few decades, we have been blessed with a selection gripping, psychological and some damn right nauseating films from the horror sub-genre, home invasion. Don't Breathe is another film added to the long list, but sadly doesn't give us the same thrill as many others. However, Don't Breathe shouldn't be disregarded and at best is a good suspense thriller with a dark secret to be revealed towards the end. Three reckless teenagers make their living by robbing peopl's homes and when they realize a blind veteran has moved into a house on an abandoned street, they seize their opportunity. After realizing he has hundreds of thousands of dollars. Although the man is blind and grieving the loss of his daughter, he is by no means an easy target. With a house so bolted up, when the feral trio find an entrance, they sure as hell will struggle to find an exit.
A few scares here and there, a little bit of gore and some suspense make it watchable, but it is not something I would rant home about. Films such as The Strangers and Funny Games set such a high standard for home invasion it is hard to top such quality."
" Tense but predictable.
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,7,"I kept waiting for someone to say Don't Breathe at some point. This movie is exactly what is expected of the title. It's got a lot in the dark, and a lot that is quiet, and that makes for some good suspense. But the ending was never in much doubt. The actors look frightened enough and Stephen Lang is suitably creepy."
" A surprisingly good film!
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,10,"I didn't expect this film to be nowhere near as good as it was. The actors are not well known by any means, the plot is really good. The actors bring the plot to life making a really good tense film.I'd definitely recommend this film, although it may not seem that good you won't be disappointed."
" Lang Kicks A$$!
",2018-11-05 00:00:00,10,"One of the best thrillers I've seen in years! Not bad for a 64 year old blind man! Stephen Lang was not playing with these dumb stupid kids that night! LOL. The only person I felt sorry for was the girl thief because I saw how her home life was! Her mother was hideous and disgusting she had a little sisters he was trying to look after. So if anybody should have got that money it should have been the Rocky. And again none of them had no business breaking into a anybody's house, yet along a blind man's house, who you assume has a settlement from losing this only kid. No sympathy from these brats from me. I thought the movie was excellent! I love how they left the ending open for a possible sequel. A lot of nice vengeful twist I did not see coming."
" Middling Horror/Suspense that got too grim
",2018-10-26 00:00:00,6,"Don't Breath began very well! And actually, up until the third act, was a creepy, suspenseful, unconventional horror movie. But the last 20-25 minutes became a bit too nasty for me. It had been dark and gruesome up to that point, but in the way that's enjoyable. But in the final third (spoilers ahead) the Blind Man decided to impregnate the main girl by hooking her up to a restraint system, putting some of his sperm in a syringe, and inserting it into her rear end. This could have been a great suspense horror if they had kept to the premise of avoiding the blind man as he stalks them though the house. But as is, it got too needlessly unpleasant for the premise it began with.
Also, this is just a personal feeling, but a part of me still felt bad watching this old army man scream in fear and pain at the end when the alarm was going off and he couldn't gather his surroundings. I know hes a horrid man, but seeing an old blind army vet man scream, squirm, and cry in pain and confusion was not something i signed up for.
Overall, a middling movie that could have been way worse...but could have been way better."
" Looks like these thieves picked the wrong blind guy to mess with
",2018-10-24 00:00:00,8,"A trio of thieves decide to break to break into the home of a blind man (superbly played with fierce intensity by Stephen Lang) who turns out to be very resourceful and hence quite dangerous.Director Fred Alvarez, who also co-wrote the tight script with Rodo Sayagues, relates the gripping story at a brisk pace, adroitly crafts plenty of nerve-wracking claustrophobic tension, and throws in a few dandy sick twists. Moreover, Alvarez brings an intriguing moral ambiguity to the picture by making the blind man someone who's anything but a harmless innocent cripple. Jane Levy as the desperate Rocky, Dylan Minnette as the antsy Alex, and Daniel Zovatto as the cocky Money all do commendable work in their roles, but this film clearly belongs to Lang's impressively ferocious and frightening portrayal of a sightless war veteran loner who's quite a nasty and scary piece of work. Pedro Luque's sharp and fluid cinematography provides a pleasing glossy sheen. The spirited shivery score by Roque Banos hits the rattling spot. An on the money nail biter."
" Pretty average movie
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,8,"It wasn't scary att all, but it had very interesting story, good and interesting characters, but one of the guys died way too early in my opinion.I really recommend to watch this movie. 8/10"
" One of the most IMPORBABLE movies ive ever seen
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,1,"Ok, so I have just finally made an IMDB account to review this movie (and will now continue to review movies from here on in, as I watch enough of them) 
First off I know its only a movie but come on, this isnt a sci-fi, this is meant to be something that could/would potentially happen, which in turn creates the gripping, tense, thriller vibes which are lost because it just gets beyond stupid. 
With the amount of plot wholes in this movie im surprised its still staying afloat in these ratings, its ridiculous! Im not going to give any spoilers, but have a long hard think about the situation and aftermath, it just would not happen like that!"
" Amazing movie
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,8,A thriller by all the meanings of the word... really well done
" Watch with bated breath.
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,8,"While the 'Don't Breathe (2016)' focuses far more on suspense than gore, it also features a fair amount of visceral violence that feels incredibly impactful thanks mainly to its lasting consequences. This isn't surprising considering it comes from Fede Alvarez, the man behind several blood-splattered movies such as 'Evil Dead (2013)'. It's this brutality that makes its villain a fairly frightening, incredibly ruthless foe despite the fact that he's completely blind, something that he uses to his advantage on a number of occasions - especially during a few fantastic 'night-vision' sequences. The story actually owes somewhat of a debt to 'Wait Until Dark (1967)', a fantastically suspenseful feature in which Audrey Hepburn plays a blind woman terrorised by home-invaders, but the focal roles are here reversed. It certainly isn't predictable and it manages to open up its small situation in an interesting and unexpected way, bridging the gap between a more traditional crime-thriller and a straight-up horror in its second half. It also has the distinct difficulty of featuring generally 'unlikable' protagonists, which makes it all the more impressive that we come to care for (most of) them pretty quickly. The exciting and tense action sequences are expertly set-up to be as clear and propulsive as possible, which are what really drive this short but 'sweet' experience. 8/10"
" More effective than sleeping pills.
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,2,"It doesn't make any sense!! Has got to be the worst film (if you can even call it that) I have ever seen. It doesn't make any sense at all, none whatsoever, it's boring..where is the story?! And the actors aren't brilliant either.I haven't got a clue how the film has so many stars. 7.1 should be 1.7. And those that are saying it's full of suspense and thrills? Where is said suspense and thrills then because I for sure didn't get any of that.I would recommend never watching this film unless you want to be put to sleep by it."
" Painstaking at times, but a true original
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,8,"""Don't Breathe"" is a true original in the ""cat and mouse"" kind of horror flick - the blind guy concept has really been put to work here in a polished way with a pretty good cast to match (Dylan Minnette being the most notable name in the lineup). Similar to the horror/thriller ""Hush"", which was also released in 2016, this movie uses a sensory disability as its primary theme. 
With ""Hush"" the protagonist was obvious, in this movie it's much less clear - I think that's a good thing; moral ambiguity is food for thought.The Blind Man, portrayed by Stephen Lang, is an ex-military guy who, despite his disability, has a constant aura of sheer intimidation and unpredictability lingering below the surface of 20/20 vision. He's a crack-shot, and the viewer is made to know it - this guy is a sharp, butterfly-floating, bee-stinging, edge-of-your-seat kind of threat. He's maimed; but if he gets you, he gets you good. The other characters were almost underdeveloped, the focus shifted too quickly from building character background and motive development into the house scenes, but the unyielding roller-coaster of the latter scenes more than made up for a sparse beginning.More than a few times there were painstaking decisions made by certain characters, a lack of common sense, or situations where I felt the producers forced an inorganic or predictable outcome for the sake of suspense, to thrill, to scare the audience or to segue more easily into other scenes, all forgivable.A thought-provoking ending rounded off a film that had outlasted its welcome by its later scenes.A standout film in a genre populated with underwhelming releases, I went in ""blind"" and was pleasantly surprised by what I could see - 7.7/10."

" Don't Breathe Review
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,8,"I saw this film when it came out in theaters and absolutely loved it. I recently just gave it a second viewing and my thoughts and opinions have changed. Don't Breathe is (for the most part) very suspenseful, but can sometimes become silly as some of the characters continue to progress, and when I mean some I mean the ""Blind Man"". As far as the acting, atmosphere, and story goes it's pretty solid. You'll have a good time just don't expect to be wowed out of your seat. 7.5/10"
" One of the worst file I ever watched
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,1,"I never watched a film which I wanted the major role die so badly. Every move they did are just nonsense and disgusting, while the director wanted to made them hero,they were just 100 % bad. I will not have a bit sooty if they were killed, and just wish they being killed asap"
" Extremely engaging horror flick!
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,9,"I had put this movie off due to it not being my preferred brand of horror, but now I regret not seeing it the minute it came out.This movie has a bit of a flat start compared to some of its contemporaries, but once we get our first bite of the main plot it becomes incredibly clear that every shot and scene is executed with direction and purpose. The stakes are continuously raised as the plot unfolds, and with a modest runtime of 1hr28min, we get all this without any scenes lingering longer than they need to.As with the plot, I was unsure about the acting in the opening few scenes, but again, I ate my words as soon as the action started. I could feel every bit of dread that the characters were feeling, and Stephen Lang's terrifying villain only added to that dread. Dialogue wasn't a huge part of this movie, but I felt that it didn't have to be due to how well the story unfolded while keeping the chit-chat at a minimum.The setting of this movie played an important part, and it is made clear how important its role is going to be from the moment we first walk through the door. Once we are shown the layout of where the action is going to take place, then we start getting a great variety of scares and super tense moments, with most of them causing more clenching than jumping, which is really nice to see in a modern horror.Absolutely not one to miss if you enjoy tension and suspense, and I will definitely be recommending this to more than a few people."
" Unique Story
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,10,I love this movie. The story is so unique. The actors are great especially the blind man. There were shocking and unexpected twist. So great. Got me breathless for sometime.
" Decisions decisions
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,3,"Don't Breathe is a flawed film, with weak characters.Why make this film? What can the viewer get out of it? The characters offer very little beyond their present actions and the third member who died early, didn't fit. They would not get to this position this trio, as a lot of trust would be required. The ending adds value to the film, with the constant life altering decisions the characters have to make. Albeit silly decisions, because you wouldn't stop to gloat or sit on the ground next to the car to take a breather, when the dog's trapped. The guy's blind you could at least look before you rest to see if he's coming, you're in the open now you can walk three meters away and then rest."
" Worth a watch at leaat
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,7,"And while I gave it a 7 out of 10 I still wouldn't buy it.
Opens relatively strong with decent characters and an intriguing plot. 
Middle seems to hold out strong for the simple storyline it is. 
Then it feels as if the director attempted to incorporate far too many elements. 
I believe this one would have been best of it had been kept simple and scary.
Worth a watch at least"
" Kids these days
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,9,"Great film. Reminded me of our old Hide-and-Seek games. Of course, without the very angry blind ex-soldier trying to kill us to prevent a big secret from leaving his house."
" Awesome

" It's nice but not that nice
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,6,"The girl in this movie is so annoying. I don't understand why she survives at the end. It should be the boy instead. I also hate when they hit him and run away, first rule hit him and then again and again and again. Don't be stupid. Also stop making the film with stupid scenes like when the girl comes outside of the house, instead of running, she looks back and tries to say something cool. This is why I said she should have not survived. But again the smart ones always die and the stupid and coward ones always survive. Yayyyy!!!"
" Outlandish But An Effective And Suspenseful Thriller
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,8,"Perhaps the best thing about ""Don't Breathe"" is the twist that takes place and leaves you wondering who - if anyone - you should be rooting for. For the first half of the movie, this is a pretty standard type of home invasion story. Three teenagers have made a career of sorts breaking into houses. As the story begins they've decided to target a blind man (a helpless blind man!) who they believe has a huge amount of money hidden inside his house. Well, it turns out that the blind man isn't quite as helpless as we might have thought. Things go wrong inside the house pretty fast. You start to expect a sort of cat and mouse thriller as this blind man sets out to get these no good kids. Except ... I don't want to give it away. Suffice to say there are a lot of secrets inside this blind man's house - enough that by the end you don't really know who the good guys are - or even if there is a good guy. It's a good (if outlandish) story, full of twists and turns that keeps you guessing pretty much the entire way through.Director Fede Alvarez did a good job with the setting, using the house - dark, mysterious and foreboding (because what would a blind man need with light anyway) - and its' neighbourhood - one of Detroit's abandoned neighbourhoods, with this blind man being the only one left in about a four square block radius, if I remember correctly. So, whether inside or outside the house, it's pretty isolated. The performances were very good. Stephen Lang was superb as the blind man, and I thought Jane Levy was very good as Rocky - the most sympathetic of the three teens, perhaps because we know the most about her home life, which isn't happy and which she dreams of escaping with her little sister.There's no doubt that the plot is, indeed, outlandish - but the story is exciting and it has a lot of suspense. The ending of the movie clearly sets up a sequel, which has already been announced - which suggests to me that they're going to take the blind man too far. But who knows. Maybe it will work. This film did work - and it worked very well. (8/10)"
" The bad guy wins?
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,1,"I love horror movies, but this is not a horror movie. I hate movies where the criminal wins in the end. That is what happens here. It would have been better if everybody died."
" The best low budget movie
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,10,"I can't believe it the budget quite low but the movie really good , is feel like high budget movie, i rarely watch thriller, but this movie make me addicted to thriller, the blind man preety scary, the way he looks like logan, is quite dark, if you not 18 dont watch, cause the content quite mature"
" almost stupid....don't waste your time
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,3,"The acting wasn't bad, but the story is very stupid. if you are 20 years old, ok, but for us that we are older this movie is not good at all. it has some good moments, but they can t save the stupid story. No real at all"

Unless your one of these three who seem to be mentally challenged. Making stupid decisions, not doing anything a normal person would do. A perfect example of the crap that is coming out of Hollywood. It only gets the 2 stars because its not the worst movie I've seen."
" WORST ENDING
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,1,Worst ENDING..She should have been killed for attempt to robbery
" Good but not perfect
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,6,I loved that this horror had the villain as a blind guy which made this very different from other home invasion movies. Also with the man's home who they broke into being from the army and traps them in and takes their lives into their hands it was a good outlook. I also liked how the beginning was shown as a woman being grabbed and dragged down the road and why this was relevant to the movie. I do wish they showed more gore and that the film had more scare factor even if jump scares as it didn't come across as scary to myself for a horror movie. However this was a good movie.
" A GOOD FUN SUSPENSEFUL THRILLER
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,8,"Don't Breathe will become a future Cult Classic in my opinion.
This is a well made suspense urban Thriller that is actually scary & very intense although completely unrealistic.
The abandoned Detroit neighbourhood that this is set in is creepy as hell, the old house that the blind man lives in is creepy too, infact the atmosphere in this movie is edge of the seat intensity, All the actors are FANTASTIC & give excellent performances especially the scary ""Stephen Lang"" as the blind man ,""Dylan Minnette"" & ""Jane Levy"" all amazing!!! This is one hell of an exciting Thriller that feels so real & gritty & very exciting!!!
Dylan Minnette is truly excellent here & is a standout performance for me.
The cinematography is outstanding & you see that in the birds eye view shots of the old decrepit run-down Detroit neighbourhood, very creepy & well shot, an urban nightmare!!!
All the actors & characters are EXCELLENT!!!
This is a dark fun Thriller made with quality even down to the good creepy atmospheric music & an atmosphere full of loneliness & dread.
DON'T BREATHE really is a fun Horror house.
There's also a sadness to this as the blind man listens to a home video of his young daughter to fall asleep too, it's a moment that is very heartfelt as his daughter died by getting run over.
Now as much as i enjoyed it there's some stupid stuff that made NO sense like how could a blind man raise a baby anyway? There's no way he couldn't look after it & there's no way he do all what he does being blind, No Way!!! But it makes more a fun ride it's just very unrealistic.One of my favourite Thriller films & just a beautifully made Thriller that i consider abit of a companion piece to ""Judgment Night"" the 1993 urban survival Thriller starring ""Emelio Estevez"" both share similar themes & both are about a small group of young people trying to survive the night in an urban nightmare world whilst being hunted!!! Now ""Judgment Night"" is surviving on the scary streets of Night time Chicago & ""Don't Breathe"" is a group trapped in a big old house of Horror but set in an urban nightmare world too, the abandoned & apocalyptic looking Detroit, so both share the theme of the ""out of your territory"" & both plays to that really scary urban-decay inner city nightmare world!!! Both great films & make a great Double feature."

",2018-08-01 00:00:00,8,I came to Don't Breathe looking for a horror but found something much darker and more disturbing instead. It is beautifully directed and the part of the blind man is amazingly portrayed. Definitely recommend it keeps you on the edge of your seat as you never know what's going to happen next.
" The thriller
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,8,The best ever thriller movie I have ever watched. Kept us at the edge of the seat throughout. Not an usual thriller......
" Please! Don't Breath!
",2018-07-18 00:00:00,8,This movie made me hold my breath everytime the villain there. Like I was in the movie and really wants to escape. Twisted ending and super tense!
" Sounds good but I just couldn't bring myself to care
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,6,"Some scalawags break into a house to steal an old mans treasure only to find he is blind.
As the title suggests he is not a man to be underestimated.This is a great idea for a movie and it is executed quite well with great production and acting.It didn't really grab my attention though.
For some reason the scenes where the main characters are sneaking around didn't feel tense, it just felt a bit stupid.
The home owner is strong and determined but is definitely no ninja.Worst of all I found it hard to bond with the main characters.
They were set up as anti-heroes with good hearts, stuck in an awful situation, but I just couldn't get passed the fact that they were thieves.I think perhaps in a time where home invasions and burglaries are prevalent in the media and a genuine concern to most homeowners it is hard not to root for the ""bad-guy""Nothing bad -but not much to be excited about either"
" just dont watch
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,1,Dont waste your time guys go and watch something else for your own good.
" Very scary, had to watch most of the film on low volume
",2018-07-10 00:00:00,6,"The film is very scary. I always rooted for the thieves, so I guess the story is well written, as I don't usually like antagonists. But who knows, everyone is a bad person in this movie. The suspense is very well created with the lighting and silences. However, I don't think a blind man has the type of capabilities that the old man has. I give it a 6."
" Best horror movie in years
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,10,I love this movie. It's simple. Intense. Claustrophobic. Jump scares abound. Lang is perfect as the blind man. Plot twist in the middle is huge and one vomit inducing gross out. Can't say enough good things about it.
" Thanks to Stephen Lang, this is awesome!!
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,7,"A simple plot with a limited cast and limited locations, yet so many twists and oh-so-unpredictable! The cast is excellent and you feel the chill down your spine! Stephen Lang in particular is outstanding as the blind man."
" Absolute cracker
",2018-06-30 00:00:00,9,"From a very tiny plot comes a huge reward. Stephen lang is superb, the director Fede Alvarez is certainly going on to bigger and more substantial work. The other main leads are very much of a muchness, but aid the story well enough, on the whole you'd say they will always be TV genre based actors. As for the film, well futility, pain, wahey scares, the obvious winners etc, gross,outlandish and weirdly touching. Enjoy with an open mind and don't look for errors, it's not real."
" Don't watch.
",2018-06-29 00:00:00,4,"In the opening scene to Don't Breathe, three youths - Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money (Daniel Zovatto) - break into a posh house, steal anything of value, and vandalise the property, smashing ornaments and urinating all over the place before chucking a rock through the window; their next target is a blind man who is rumoured to have a small fortune in his home, the cash settlement he received after his daughter was run down and killed. Writer/director Fede Alvarez then has the audacity to ask his audience to give a damn about what happens to this trio of white trash scum-bags.Not on your nelly!I don't care how rotten an upbringing Rocky has had, or that she cares for her little sister, or that the blind man turns out to be far from helpless and more than a little bit twisted - rooting for Rocky and her thieving pals is not an option, making the film a frustrating experience from the outset.But unlikable protagonists aren't my only issue with Don't Breathe: there's the small issue of the blind man (played by Stephen Lang), who makes Zatoichi and Daredevil look like clumsy buffoons by comparison. Some of the things this sightless guy is able to do are utterly ridiculous: disarming a gun-toting enemy, repeatedly turning up at the right place at the right time, abducting a woman and keeping her in a basement prison (which, presumably, he also constructed), reaching up to yank Rocky from air ducting, and silently tracking his victim in the surrounding derelict neighbourhood, all without stubbing a toe. His guard dog also displays supercanine qualities, the hound even climbing up furniture and entering an air vent to pursue Rocky.Alvarez manages a couple of effective jump scares along the way, and delivers a memorably yucky scene involving a turkey baster and a large helping of 'gentleman's relish', but the movie is, for the most part, way too dumb and loaded with implausibilities and glaring plot holes to be good for anything but unintentional laughs."
" Left me cold
",2018-06-29 00:00:00,4,"DON'T BREATHE is a well-regarded horror film of 2016, but I'm afraid I found it rather overblown and predictable. The plot, which sees a team of burglars breaking into the house of an old blind man who turns out to be rather less than innocent, was already done previously in THE COLLECTOR and THE COLLECTION and this adds little more to the story. The protagonists of the film are all young, grungy and unlikeable, so there's not much involvement there, and the one saving grace is another fine performance from Stephen Lang as the antagonist of the hour. Elsewhere, it's the usual chasing around in the dark, with cliched scares and plot development and a general hackneyed, seen-it-all-before feel."
" Intense but flawed
",2018-06-27 00:00:00,8,"I thought this movie was quite suspenseful. Just watching this movie I felt the need to not make any noise. I was very entertained by this movie, and that was the point of the movie. This movie didn't try to be anything more than an intense thrill ride that kept you on the edge of your seat, and they did just that. I'll try to describe my issue with it without spoiling anything. There are just some points where you get so frustrated with the characters for not doing the obvious thing they should do in whatever situation they're in at the time. It makes you want to yell at your TV and say ""WHY DONT YOU JUST DO THIS??"" Also there are a couple parts in which the events are a little far-fetched and leaves you wondering ""oh come on how is that actually possible?""Nonetheless, this movie is quite the thrill ride and very entertaining, and I would love to rate it higher but the flaws are kind of obvious at times."
" Tense
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,7,"Decent enough thriller.Keeps the tension up to the end, without quite scaring you senseless"
" Best movie ever
",2018-06-11 00:00:00,10,This movie better than all horror movie I've ever seen
" The girl with the guy's name is the one to get away, gee, how original and innovative
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,1,"And that' s not a spoiler, as anyone with a brain could predict that the moment they saw the lead female character whose name is ""Rocky"" (ugh *face palms*). I guess the director/writer didn't get the memo that giving female characters male names is one of the most tired, overdone, cliched things you could do. Once you hear that, that pretty much foreshadows how tired, overdone, and cliched this movie is in general, finally culminating in the ultimate ""Last Girl"" and damsel in distress clichesFirst off, what an enlightened depiction of the blind. I guess the person who directed this (his name is not really worth mentioning) didn't receive any funding from the American Foundation for the Blind. And the one black character has barely any screentime and dies first. Hey look, yet even more innovation and originality. You basically can't get anymore clichéd than that. And this is a movie set in Detroit (with its large black population), which makes that doubly insulting and stupid. I can tell this director is really progressive. Not sure if the sarcasm is coming off here. The other characters are mostly stock types too, and obnoxious to boot (which is what I wanted to do to ""Rocky"" especially). I suppose in another great act of innovation and originality, there's a failed attempt to make the lead (surprise!) female character the most sympathetic by contriving an abusive background for her and trying to justify her robbing a huge amount of money from a blind person in order to save her (surprise!) little sister from said abusive background. But it really very much feels like she's only out to save herself. Does the director/writer actually think we're supposed to root for this scum chick who was trying to rob a blind man who had just lost his daughter (oop! Another female! Surprise! ) And this was before they even knew, btw, that he captured the woman (Yet another female...surprise...) who gave him the money. I guess having a male captive and expect people to feel sympathy for him would be just too innovative and original for them to handle. Apparently it never occurred to this director or writer that making only female characters the ones we're expected to care about and have sympathy for is sexist. But with the way, as I've mentioned, this mediocre hack no-talent depicts the blind and black people, I guess we all already knew he's not the most enlightened person (in addition to being untalented and unoriginal, to boot). This movie actually might have been somewhat redeemed if the ending was different and the formulaic Rocky character finally got hers after all by the blind man in some clever and inventive way or something. It would also have been much more horror-like to do so - although not for me. I guess that wouldn't have been a scary ending for me because I was actually rooting for her to die. I would have just cheered. But for others it could have been much scarier and more effective since this is supposed to be a scary movie....isn't it?What's with the overhype and uncritical critical reviews so many sub-par and mediocre horror movies, and lame movies in general, these days get? I know pervasive collective mental illness, poisonous ideology, and general brain fugue from a desperate and depressed population who probably couldn't handle anything that's actually original, innovative, and truly terrifying has something to do with it, but can that explain it all away? Then again, when I see the rather mediocre (and much more deserving) 7.1 this movie now has here, I guess alls not wrong with the world after all. This kind of thing tends to happen after the original false hype dissipates and people generally forget about it and move on to another piece of nose tissue, which they will no doubt just as quickly blow their nose on, and just as quickly throw away and forget about just as they had the previous one. And so on.1 out of 10 stars. And it can be happy and lucky it got that."
" Durable home invasions plot serves as a showcase for director Fede Alvarez
",2018-06-03 00:00:00,8,"A trio of burglars, Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, and Daniel Zovatto, break into a blind veteran's remote home, the great Stephen Lang, to steal a recent large legal settlement. The young burglars get more than they planned for when they instead find themselves the trapped inside the home and stalked by Lange. The fact that Lang's character cannot see and the burglars cannot speak for fear he'll hear them and kill them makes it so a majority of the films done wordlessly and in complete silence. These sorts of movie set-ups are what I consider ""pure cinema,"" telling a story on film that could not be told in another medium. Not as a book not as a comic, not as a play, or not in any other storytelling format. ""Don't Breathe"" builds suspense with visuals and sound in a way that would not transfer to another medium. Now the set-up is not all that clever or original (I supposed you could say it's ""Wait Until Dark"" turned on it's head), but director Fede Alvarez, who'd previously directed the surprisingly strong ""Evil Dead"" remake, builds tension like a master and has crafted a wicked little suspense thriller. In contrast to his ""Evil Dead"" remake, this film steers away from blood and gore and instead focuses on suspense, creating a situation where the audience can't help but ask themselves, what would they do in this situation? Credit for this also goes to a strong script co-written by Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues, which the best of these sorts of films have the characters have the characters take the logical actions the audience would do in that same situation. It's like the classic haunted house story question. Why don't the characters just leave? The script for ""Don't Breath"" does a great job of exhausting all of the logical options you'd think the burglars would do to try to escape (cell phones, guns, windows, door locks, basement exits, etc.). The story does seem to overly rely on horror movie tropes than I would have liked (torture, the-last-girl, night vision, etc..), but it's all done so well that horror movie aficionados won't care. Produced by Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert, with an fine score by Roque Baños, ""Don't Breath"" is a must see for horror fans!"
" Really interesting
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,7,"It had an intriguing story that started out so-so, but had more twists and suspense later on. It was more mysterious than scary, but adds up better as it goes along. No classic, but good."
" Edge of seat stuff
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,8,"Alex gets information from his Dad's security company to target houses for burglaries which he carries out with Rocky and Money (he fancies Rocky, but she is Money's girlfriend). Rocky is a victim of her alcoholic mother, Alex would be a decent lad if he wasn't besotted with Rocky, and Money is a despicable sh!t beyond redemption. So another job is lined up....The target is the only remaining inhabited house in a deserted section of Detroit. The occupant is a blind war veteran who has a settlement from the parents of a girl who killed his daughter in a road accident: that settlement is the target for the burglary. No-one lives nearby, the old guy is blind, and Money has brought along a gun, you know, just in case. What could possibly go wrong?Anyone who has seen a movie with a similar set-up - it's not uncommon - will know that quite a lot can go wrong, actually. And so it does, And it would be really unfair for me to say any more, for two reasons.One, this film is very suspenseful, and I wouldn't want to spoiler any of the suspenseful elements as our three young villains try to avoid being detected by the unseeing householder.And, two, there are a number of occasions where the story takes you into WTF? territory. Perfectly fairly, it turns out, but sudden turns which come at you out of nowhere. I do love a film which suddenly completely wrongfoots you.Stephen (Avatar) Lang is the blind veteran, but the young unknown actors who play the gang are all very good, too.Despite having some misgivings over the way the perceived moralities of the characters get played with, I thought this was a rather good suspense thriller."
" Complete junk
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,3,This movie is one error after another. I've lost all respect for this genre
" Probable copycat of ""Intruders""
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,8,"I caught this one on one of the movie channels. This is a well directed and played movie. I would place it in the horror/mystery category with the emphasis on horror. It uses the time honored device of buildup, buildup, release then impact to shock the audience. It is well worth seeing for horror fans. This is also an example of how when a story idea is shopped around 'Hollywood' that the general idea is used in more than one movie. Being as ""Intruders"" and ""Don't Breathe"" were released a year apart, I won't speculate on who came first in the story concept. This one is more horror while ""Intruders"" is more mystery/suspense. Both feature outstanding performances by the female lead and somewhat vague endings. Both feature similar but not matching situations. I was impressed by this movie but enjoyed ""Intruders"" more just because I don't need my heart rate increased by horror movies so much anymore. If I could state a one sentence comparison: ""Intruders"" is smarter while ""Don't Breathe"" scarier. Stephen Lang delivers another great performance. For horror fans it deserves 10 stars but for me it gets 8 because it is too scary for an old codger like me. Lang and Levy both deserve 10s."
" Trash that Glorifies Scum
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,4,"Three societal parasites, a skank, a dudebro loser and a useful idiot have been perpetrating burglaries in the dumbest of ways. Somehow, a list of Useful Idiot's father's home security clients are being burglarized. As if by magic, these homes are thoroughly ransacked, vandalized, looted, before the alarm goes off. Fortunately, these morons live in the Detroit area, where crimes are apparently never investigated. If anyone did investigate, such as a cop in a coma, or Mr. Magoo, they'd immediately suspect a connection between Useful Idiot's dad and the crimes.Also as if by magic, these losers have gotten word that an old guy in a generally abandoned neighborhood has a lot of cash in his house. As luck would have it, he's also one of Useful Idiot's dad's customers. So, they go over to rob the guy. He's a blind guy, as it happens. A blind veteran. But they go ahead with the plan anyway. Keep in mind, the piece of crap who wrote this piece of crap expects the audience to regard these robbers of the elderly and infirm as the heroes of the story. But it's at this point that you should be eagerly anticipating whatever horrible thing is about to happen to these creeps.The scumbags arrive at the house, and drug his dog. More winning. The house is locked up like a vault. They break in with some effort.At this point, any action by the occupant of the house to deter or defend against this home invasion is justified. But this is augmented by the additional threat of the dudebro packing heat. After dudebro fails to force the blind veteran to ingest harmful chemicals (sleeping gas cooked up in a soda bottle), he menaces THE VICTIM with his firearm. Because he's a stupid dudebro thug with bad hair and neck tattoos and zero firearms training, the veteran easily disarms him and kills him with his own weapon. The rest of the movie is a panicked attempt by the vermin to escape the house with the veteran's money before he gets his hands on them. There's a subplot, sure. A wealthy woman has caused the death of the veteran's daughter. She isn't held legally responsible. Somehow, this blind guy has managed to abduct the woman, hold her captive in his basement, and has inseminated her, artificially. His deal is that she owes him a daughter. No, I'm not kidding. Somebody actually wrote that.As the human garbage attempts to flee through the cellar, they stumble upon this woman, free her, attempt to escape with her, and she ends up being shot and killed by the veteran. Outraged, he then intends to capture the skank and inseminate her instead. The movie shows a lovely closeup of a public hair in a container of old man sperm as it's being drawn into a turkey baster type syringe. Thanks, movie. This syringe is later shoved into the old man's mouth and deployed with much sputtering. Thanks again, movie.Which of course suggests that the skank is rescued by the Useful Idiot. Too bad. But at least the idiot doesn't make it out of the house. He finally dies trying to unlock the front door. But the skank is sadly lucky. She escapes after she ostensibly kills the old guy.As she's about to depart for her glorious future as a dead former meth-addicted porn star in California, she sees a news story about the burglary of the old guy, which says that he survived. She looks alarmed.Which brings me to the plug line for the proposed sequel to this flick: ""The blind old man returns to terrorize more unsuspecting people.""I do beg your pardon, movie, but the guy terrorized no one. The movie was about sociopaths who attempted to prey upon the man. The main characters were criminals, and no one should be glad this woman got away with her numerous crimes.Gave it a 4 rating for production value."
" One of the best movie ever
",2018-04-20 00:00:00,10,At first I didn't expect much of this movie at all but after the movie I was so surprised how goooood this movie was... it's been a long time sinds I saw the good movie..
" Proof that thrillers can be developed on the cheap
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,7,"The emergence of indie suspense-thrillers/horrors in the past few years has not gone unnoticed. And while Blumhouse Productions has virtually owned this genre of late, Screen Gems/Ghost House Pictures had a monster hit with 2016's low-budget 'Don't Breathe.'The premise is simple enough - three young burglars in the metro Detroit area decide to break into a decrepit home of a blind war veteran to steal $300K he was awarded in a settlement following the death of his daughter. What could go wrong here? Well, let's start with the fact that said blind man (Stephen Lang) has basically turned into a dog with a heightened sense of hearing and smell. Of course, things don't start out well for the three bandits (Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto) and they don't get any better as things progress.The reason why 'Breathe' works is because it's so raw and it doesn't try to be some grandiose spectacle. The success of the film relies on the small cast, the setting (i.e., the house) and sound - or lack thereof. These basic elements are enough to captivate audiences when done correctly, and that's why 'Breathe' is what it is. There are enough scenes where you are on the edge of your seat because you know what will likely happen, but it's just a matter of how it will happen. The best part is, a lot of what's expected either doesn't materialize or the plot is a winding road that takes a while for things to actually play out.Sure, there are some part of 'Breathe' that feel a bit cliche. The foreshadowing/harkening back to moments noted earlier in the film, particularly those relevant to Rocky - the female bandit who is motivated to seek a better life for her and her little sister - are blatant and can be seen from a mile away. There are also plenty of ""Seriously?"" moments that just seem ridiculous, but that's also what makes this film so interesting.'Don't Breathe' is proof that you don't need millions upon millions of dollars to create something edgy, smart and thrilling."
" Suspense overload...
",2018-03-24 00:00:00,6,"""Don't Breathe"" is a horror movie in which we watch a group of thieves trying to break into a house in which we will find a massive fortune. In this house, only a blind man with tragic past lives. He and his dog live an isolated and lonely life. After they break into his house, they start searching for that massive fortune but everything will change when the blind man will understand their presence. And as they were thinking that they will walk away easily with all the money, the blind man does not think the same way.I liked this movie because it had a very interesting plot with many twists and because of the very well-written script. I also believe that the direction which was made by Fede Alvarez was simply amazing and his beautiful work it can be easily understood in the whole duration of this film. I liked a lot the interpretation of Stephen Lang who played The Blind Man and he simply nailed his role. Other good interpretations were Jane Levy's who played Rocky and Dylan Minnette who played Alex. The best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of suspense and an interesting plot which combination of both is the key for a good movie.Finally, I believe that ""Don't Breathe"" is a good horror movie with plenty of suspense and many twists that will keep you alert for the whole duration of it. I also think that you aren't going to waste your time watching it. I recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much since it's something different from all the other horror movies that you have ever watched."
" Breath of Fresh Scare.
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,7,"Thrilling and utterly entertaining. The biggest, and arguably the only stupid mistake made by any of those kids was Money shooting at the lock, however, they needed to get that lock open, and whatever method they were going to use - short of liquid nitrogen - was probably always going to be loud.From there, the movie proceeds quite competently, and of course Don't Breathe is the type of movie where that is the make or break. Money, Rocky and Alex go in house. Alex decides it's too dangerous and leaves. Blind Man kills Money. Rocky is understandably in shock. Alex comes back because he heard the shot and wants to protect Rocky. Once back in the house, Alex enters a situation that's already running at full speed. From there, these two kids, these inexperienced and scared out of their mind kids, are up against a veteran on his own turf... Plus, that damn dog.Rocky stole the money because, why not? That is the mission and you might as well. Sure, Money is dead, but, you're already in the situation, so, you make the best of it. Rocky needs that money, so they can't call the cops. So, it makes sense to try and escape, then call in an anonymous tip later. The Blind Man knows that house like the back of his hand, so, him keeping them hostage was very believable.Don't Breathe is a film of antiheroes and anti-villains, and that is what keeps it fresh. Nobody in this movie is all good, but they all, (except Money hence his death) have motives worth looking in to. 7/10."
" Don't Buy!!!
",2018-03-18 00:00:00,3,"I bought this movie at Walmart from their five dollar bin. I knew this movie wasn't great but I thought it would be entertaining at the very least.

" Utter trash
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,3,"This movie is nothing but a collection of tropes and cliches. There is nothing new here, nothing interested, nothing exciting. It's eye-rollingly predictable, with only one plot point of any interest whatsoever. Teleporting bad guys, people who can shrug off concussions in seconds, and characters willing to kill people but not dogs round out the stupidity.Oh, and this is not a horror movie. It's a suspense thriller, and barely qualifies as that.Stop giving Sam Raimi movies good ratings because it's Sam Raimi. This is appallingly bad."

" Started as a thriller, ended as a dud
",2018-01-20 00:00:00,3,"The movie could have turned out much better. However, it is done in by stretched scenes, lack of originality and the not-so-thought-out characters. In all fairness, after rising up, through for the first twenty odd minutes, the movie quite conspicuously falls down to the point of becoming quite irritating. There are a lot of loose ends in the plot. Contextual detailing is poor and this further debilitates the storyline. The movie doesn't merit further commentary."
" One of the better horror films this decade
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,9,Fede Alvarez delivers a breath-taking film that will have you on the edge of your seat. This movie was absolutely brilliant. You could really feel the fear of the actors deep down and they did an astounding job portraying their characters. I couldn't take my eyes off of this film and found myself holding my breath along with the actors. Well worth the watch and the blu ray buy.
" good horror

" Don't Breathe: Walking on egg shells
",2017-12-15 00:00:00,7,"My, the period 2013-2017 has been great for horror movies! With this, the Conjuring 1&2, Babadook, It follows, Lights Out and Get Out among another have really stood out as well as raising the bar for horror writing and acting. I am so happy that this is the case. If this trend continues maybe more people will take horror more seriously as an art form. Who knows maybe one will get a best picture Oscar soon?Don't Breathe centres around three thieves. Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette) and Money ( Daniel Blanco) who for a number of different reasons want to get enough money to improve their lives. Rocky in particular wants to leave her abusive parents with her younger sister in the hopes of a better life. The answer to all of their prayers seems to come in the form of robbing a blind man's (Stephen Lang) house which supposedly has enough money to solve all their troubles. However once inside the house the blind man as it turns out is not as helpless as he looks.....Don't breathe takes full advantage of the claustrophobic set of a small, cramped decrepit house. You feel that every corner could result in death; the tiniest creek of a floor board might help the blind man hunt down the three. Director Fede Alvarez takes every opportunity to make the viewer feel on the edge of their seat, make you feel the stress the characters are experiencing knowing how the smallest sound might kill them. Because of this the film has a terrific atmosphere.The acting too is fantastic, everyone is not only believable in their roles but are able to show just how scared they are when they find themselves in over their head. Alex, Money and Rocky are stupid either and despite their chosen profession are likeable to an extent. Even the Blind man is sympathetic to an extent, even if his motives are questionable. The idea of not making noise to survive is really cleaver and further contributes to some incredibly intense moments, the film again does not waste any of the material the concept has. I would say that, without going into any spoilers the story suffers from unnecessarily complexity. If the film had just been about the three escaping the house but it adds story elements that at least I feel are not really needed and detracts from the pacing. However it is very personal and I doubt most would be bothered by this. As a horror movie Don't Breathe is a thrilling watch, as a piece of film making it is a very well made film.

",2017-12-03 00:00:00,4,"Spoiler Alert ------------- whatever happens, heroine of the movie won't die at the end.the same stupid thing in most of the typical Hollywood thrillers and horror movies can also seen in the movie.i know this from the beginning itself, so i don't felt not much tension while watching this cliché thriller.the acting and some of the scenes of that old man is good and the dog scenes are perfect."
" don't fart
",2017-11-27 00:00:00,3,"just saw this flick and very not impressed.basic story 3 punk kids try to rob an old blind guy ,which they find out is a bad idea .ex war veteran ,trained to kill ,you know the rest.i think whoever made this pile of poop was trying to emphasise kids go naughty because they are forced to and deep down are really decent people trying to survive.rubbish ,only you choose the path in life and i had no sympathy for these little s***s full stop.so i guess that took the point of the film away.anyway the whole movie is shot in the dark so you cant see bugger all ,and the places they find to hide and run i guess it must of been a 50 room hotel.several bits of the plot are ridiculous ,and i didn't make any sense out of them ,unless this guy is a superhero the whole film is based on immpossibilities ,in fact it was so dull and predictable i turned it off half an hour before the end ,so there it is ,dont waste you're dosh."
" I literally didn't breathe
",2017-11-22 00:00:00,10,"Despite the violence, the real horror of ""Don't Breathe"" may be the sense of futility that all its characters feel, whether or not they can see. Don't Breathe cuts a fresh path, providing thrill-seeking moviegoers and horror die-hards with an inventive as well as terrifying movie experience."
" Requires much suspension of disbelief.
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,7,"Three young punks - Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette), and ""Money"" (Daniel Zovatto) - are experienced at home robberies. Rocky and Alex (who's in love with her) are somewhat more even keeled. ""Money"" is just a plain pile of scum. They hear about a potential huge windfall to come from invading the home of an isolated, blind Iraq war vet (Stephen Lang). Supposedly he got a nice juicy settlement from the filthy rich family of a girl who'd killed the vets' daughter in a traffic accident.Getting inside the house is not too hard. However, the blind man is much more formidable an adversary than these brainless punks realize.I can see how many viewers would take the story (concocted by Rodo Sayagues and director Fede Alvarez) to task. There's barely a believable moment in it, starting with the fact that it takes an eternity before we ever hear police sirens, despite all the gunfire throughout the movie.Provided viewers can put their own brains in neutral, there IS entertainment to be derived from ""Don't Breathe"", but that's due to the execution, not the concept. Alvarez creates some effective suspense and atmosphere within this house, and there's visceral pleasures to be had from the violence. (If you can't stand any of the characters, you might at least enjoy seeing them being put through so much hell.) The script manages at least one amusing twist - which makes no sense, but does put Langs' character into perspective for you.The acting from Levy, Minnette, and Zovatto is adequate; her more so than the others, because she at least gets a character that is fleshed out to some degree. Veteran actor Lang, who's often specialized in creepy or outright psychotic roles, steals the show as the blind man, even if he only has about 13 lines or so, most of them towards the end of the picture.Filmed in (and set in) Detroit, although the interiors of the house were actually done in a studio in Hungary.Seven out of 10."
" So Lack Movie !
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,3,"Do not Breathe (2016) worst horror movie I've ever seen ..Telling about three stupid teens infiltrated into a house of a blind former war veteran ... This movie is not thrilling at all, the character of the character in this movie is very annoying ... There is no horror in this movie ... It's true lousy ...The Blind Man character is really cheap ....And on the site rotten tomatoes this movie got a score of 87%.Fede Alvarez I think he failed in this movie ......"
" Don't breath review
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,1,"First 10 minutes of the movie was pretty interesting. There are many plot holes and predictable events through out the movie. What really upset me was the moral behind the story: a wounded veteran who was blind, and lost his daughter... and these three teenagers decides to rob him for their own selfish gain. Everyone is suffering, doesn't make the girl more right to have all that money. She governed the lives of these two men- who both didn't make it, but she gets to survive? She had the opportunity to escape, yet decides to save the girl, yet she didn't want want to leave without the money??? girl, get your priority straight, if she had ANY sense of morality, she wouldn't have robbed anyone. Get a job and work! This poor old man... how come the girl's action was never justified? Whoever wrote this is a sick teenager who probably bullied their weaker classmates at school. Now I say your movie is a waste of everybody's time, and shame on you for making the veteran an antagonist."

" if you enjoy watching extreme violence perpetrated without the consequences
",2017-11-10 00:00:00,6,"Difficult one for me to evaluate. I'm sure it does everything the makers intended and that for some this is one rocking good non-stop action movie. I watched the much earlier, Five Dolls For an August Moon (Mario Bava) the night before and in truth that is very much a case of style over substance. It looks great all the time but while there is violence, most of this is off screen and almost incidental. With Don't Breathe, the action is everything. It is very well done but just how many times does someone get beaten to death and not be dead? It is a simple tale that could be told in five minutes but is drawn out like some interminable boxing match. It is interesting that this has a modest 15 certificate in the UK, even Holland gives it a more 'adult' rating of 16 and I guess this is because despite the awful and constant bludgeoning of each other, there is little or no blood. Strangely enough in the aforementioned Bava film, although the killings are not shown, the dead bodies are revealed as having what looks like a bottle of ketchup over them. I think maybe I'm rambling so I'll stop. To conclude, if you enjoy watching extreme violence perpetrated without the consequences being too apparent, this is for you."
" Things get way out of hand in this good horror movie
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,7,"I stopped watching horror movies some time ago because I think they rely too much on jump scares or easy terrifying things nowadays, but I gave this one a shot since I saw it recommended somewhere. Take that in mind while reading my review, specially if you think as I do.Don't Breathe starts off with a trio of thieves that are basically experts into breaking into houses, getting expensive things and running away with it. They have a rule, thought: no money. Suddenly, impulse by their desires of running away from their lives, they plan on get into a n old veteran's house, who's blind but has a ridiculous amount of money. Things seem easy, but something goes away from their eyes and they end up on the most complicated night of their lives.This movie starts slow. Not too slow, but expect something like 15 minutes of character background and set up before the plot takes off and things get interesting. I think it's a good thing since not everything has to be scares in this type of movies (like, give my heart a rest before it explodes out of my chest if possible), but worth point out.I personally love when a horror movie has a strong bad character that leaves the protagonist(s) with only the option to run and hide, and this movie really has that. The blind man (his name is not revealed in the movie) is like the unbeatable final boss in a video game, and being blind isn't that much of a handicap for him since his always a step ahead. It also matches with the fact that he's a veteran, it doesn't look like he has superpowers. It's a well done and rounded character, I like him.So, without further ado, here's my recommendation: watch it, it's good."
" Nail-biting moments in this one....excellent!! Solid 7 Stars from me!
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,7,"That was great! Messed up movie with a bunch of thieves and a blind person taking them all out of their wrong-doing. Which of them were spared? Oh and the rottweiler dog? Now I see where we get our ideas about these dogs...in the movies! Movies are not supposed to be used for real life-giving and life- altering ideas, but more for simple entertainment and pleasure. Does this one backfire on the perpetrators? You'll have to watch and find out on your own. It's a good movie and worth a viewing. In my opinion, the moral of this story is to not do unto others anything you would not want done unto you. Put yourself in the intended victim's shoes first and ask yourself if you would want someone to do that to you. If you don't want it done unto you, then don't do it unto me."
" Plothole the movie.
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,1,"If you expect a movie to be at least a little bit realistic then this one is definitely not for you.Braindead and extremely unlikable main characters who have literally zero common sense. Full of plot holes. Ludicrous plot twists. But it has jump scares and it is so dark you cant see ****! Its a horror movie!!!I feel disgusted. Not by the laughable ""disgusting scene"", but by the high score this movie has on this website."
" A film that does almost everything right
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,7,"This is an almost perfect movie, for what it tries to do: entertain and shock. The story has got its twists and surprises, so it's not that predictable, but stays very simple (in a good way), and uses the very cool premise to its advantage. It starts and ends at the perfect moment, and has great pacing, so it never feels long, or drags out. The movie is very grounded, so when the violence comes, you feel it, and it almost never goes to far, so you don't get taken out of the movie.It looks great, but shows dirty and disgusting things so it has a classy trash feeling, some might say. If you like horror movies or thrillers, and is are not shocked by violence and gore, it will be an easy, fun watch for you but i would not recommend it to sensitive watchers."
" Two out of Three Strikes
",2017-10-23 00:00:00,5,"DON'T BREATHE is a wonderfully shot, well-paced, and well-performed crime thriller, with sorely underrated character actor Stephen Lang turning another terrific performance as The Blind Man. I was ready to believe that its biggest flaw was an ill-fitting title (guys, come on, you could have done much better than ""Don't Speak""; it almost made me skip it as another lame horror film). The plot was unique enough to reel me in: a trio of home invaders getting the tables turned on them when they try to rob an old blind man. Much of the movie is done so well that I don't need to elaborate here; I'll just say it's worth seeing, but I'll offer up its central flaw as a caveat: Ironically, the filmmakers seem to suffer from a blind spot of their own by confusing who we are meant to root for with who we should root for, and why.""Rocky"", the would-be heroine, keeps nice-guy Alex in the friend zone while she and her wanna-be gangster boyfriend ""Money"" (really?) use Alex to burglarize homes. Their spree is made possible by Alex's dad working for a home security company that installs the alarms of the places they burgle, or something like that. The problem is Rocky, who is uninteresting and a bit of an a-hole, yet we're intended to root for her.Strike One is Rocky taking advantage of Alex. Rocky has no redeeming qualities, so the only apparent reason Alex likes her is that she's hot. Knowing this, the morally bankrupt Rocky is able to play the sap like a fiddle, easily bending him to her will and immediately making her not very root-able for. The viewer is meant to sympathize with Rocky purely on the merit of her having a crappy family home, a crappy mom, etc., as if her unfortunate situation makes her a lovable hero, not, you know, her actions or personality. Or I suppose that, like Alex, we're intended to sympathize with her just because she's hot. Oh, wait...she has a kid. A daughter named ""Diddy"" for some reason that goes unexplained. I almost forgot since Diddy is only there as part of the scenery for one scene. That's why we should care, because she's doing it for her kid's life not to suck. Sure (ahem). Even if so, why does Alex have to risk his life and his dad's job and reputation for her effing kid? When Alex opts out of this job stating those reasons, Rocky gives no Fs about that. That sweet life she's dreaming of with her crappy boyfriend will be made on Alex's bones, if need be. She actually tells him that once they're done, it's 'Sayonara, buddy'. But when Rocky says please, the sap is all in, cause hey...maybe someday she'll realize what a swell guy he is and what a jerk her thug boyfriend is. :|The Blind Man's backstory is his daughter was killed in a hit-and- run, producing his large settlement. We soon find out that the driver who committed the manslaughter got away with it, and she's now chained up in The Blind Man's gilded cage, barefoot 'n pregnant (literally) with his replacement baby via turkey baster insemination. (I'm not positive but I think we're supposed to overlook the fact that she took a life and got away with it.) After Rocky and Alex's shenanigans cause the death of the kidnapped woman, The Blind Man ultimately captures and tries to inseminate Rocky to replace the lost child. Alex miraculously survives the sweet embrace of death so that he can rescue Rocky from Karmic Recompense. Again, this sap will do anything for a girl who gives no shits about him, including moving away from the light to save her. Leading us to Strike Two:When she's free, Rocky gets her licks in on The Blind Man for trying to violate her. Yay, physical aggression = feminism! (Except that she had to be rescued by a man, which I've been told is very anti-feminist in a narrative.) ANYWAY...this is meant to be Big Cheer moment for the heroine of the story for having triumphed over the evil of nearly being violated...except for the tiny problem of SHE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN THAT SITUATION TO BEGIN WITH IF SHE WASN'T TRYING TO ROB THE GUY. The issue here is culpability (or, in the parlance of our times, ""victim blaming""). Now one could argue that home invasion/robbery is a ""victimless"" crime, or at least isn't nearly as high on the moral depravity scale as a forced insemination violation...but does Rocky bear no part of the blame for her fate, even if plotting to rip off a blind man is what got her into this predicament? If we say that Money 'had it coming to him' when getting his brains blown out by The Blind Man, doesn't that imply that Rocky had it coming, too? Maybe not, but regardless, we're meant to applaud her striking back. Against the blind guy she was trying to rob.:|Don't be misled by my raking the movie over the coals a bit. If it were a hopeless piece of crap film, I wouldn't care, but it was good enough to wish it was better. So despite that the moral center of the film is horribly imbalanced, it certainly has enough going for it to be entertaining, IMO. Give it a shot, maybe you'll like DON'T BREATHE more than I did. A note to the filmmakers, though, for your next flick: by default, the audience roots for the guy seeking justice and protecting himself, not for the a-hole characters who killed his kid and trying to rob him. You'd do well to write your story accordingly."
" Ridiculously hypocritical
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,4,"Very shocked of the way this movie was delivered as to say the least. Has got to be one of the most hypocritical stories ever. Three kids break into a wealthy blind man's house attempting to steal his fortune. The premise is - 3 kids = bad, poor old blind man = good, yet it gets turned around completely to manifest into the most hypocritical story line i have ever seen in my life.There are a lot of errors in this movie, the blind man is doing things completely impossible for someone with his disability, he is navigating through obstacles with ease fighting people and shooting guns, seemingly he can easily set up complicated structures/ kidnap people too as revealed later. The premise was cool and they should have gone with it, but they chose to completely derail the plot into this mess. The dog was a cool accomplice to the blind guy, but it had inconsistent appearances, it would just randomly disappear and then appear out of nowhere, when convenient for the plot.Aside from all the massive flaws here, the action was somewhat decent, the only thing ruining the vibe is you not understanding who to root for here, because the spotlights keep changing all the time. Had a couple of good fight scenes, especially the ones involving the dog. The ending was somewhat decent, possibly insinuating a sequel, which would have to be insanely impossible knowing how everything ended and the fact the main guy is blind.Overall nothing special, easily forgettable, because of its massive logical flaws and fails. Another great premise poorly executed, sadly."

" Good Thrill But Terrible Message
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,5,"I rate this film 5 because, as a thriller, it did hold my attention and gives a thrill ride. Despite most reviews, I kind of like the darkness in the atmosphere. It makes the film look mysterious and a bit scary. I also like the way the camera moves in unpredictable way. However, this film is morally rotten and its ending made me angry. It makes me hate this movie and never want to watch it again and will not recommend anyone to watch it at all.(Big Spoiler Ahead)This movie has terrible story. I mean, the protagonist girl is selfish and cruel for breaking into a blind old man house to get all of his spare money so that she can live the life she wants. To me, I cheer for the old man most of the time to kill Money and Rocky and maybe sparing Alex, who seems to be the most decent among them. Then I found out that he is also a criminal. But still...to me, the motivation of the blind man for becoming deranged and lock that rich girl who killed his child and got away in the basement until she gives him a baby is more understandable and deserve more sympathy than what the protagonist girl did. Do you think stealing all the save money of a blind old man who lives alone is something to celebrate? The triumph of the protagonist girl in the ending makes me feel how morally rotten the world has become."
" its good

" Kill them and eat them
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,3,"First of all, if you haven't watched this film yet, don't. But if you won't listen to reason, and you think you might watch it despite my clear direction not to watch it, at least stop reading now and get out while you can because my review is full of spoilers and other useless comments. I gave Don't Breathe three stars because (spoliler here) the cool blind badass dude shoots some fukcers. And he can smell a stranger's shoes in his house. And he has a cool dungeon. But then he gets all emo after he shoots the chick that killed his daughter. Waaa. Shut the eff up and shoot some more people, blind dude or I'm changing the channel. Others have articulated the huge plot holes, like, how did he manage to get the chick into his dungeon without a proper staircase? Who knows, maybe he wasn't blind when he kidnapped her or maybe he has moments when he's not blind or maybe he's not blind at all and he's just stumbling around cuz he's clumsy. Iwas willing to look past all that because, you know, old scary house and the owner has a gun so let's to the action. Boy was I disappointed. I think the thing that bothered me the most was, WTF - dude serves his country and goes blind, then this entitled white beeyatch steals his cash and we're supposed to say, ""Oh thank god there's a happy ending.""?I wish he had effing plugged them all and eaten them. THAT would have been a happy ending. Blind dude and his dog kill the intruders and eat them, then we see that this has happened many times. Why can't filmmakers have some original ideas? It took me exactly one minute to think that up and type it. Boom. See it's not that hard. It's called Vision, dudes. I thought of it drunk so what's your excuse? Lazy filmmakers. You're worse than the lazy old people who live in my mom's boarding house."
" 3 young people break into the house of an ex-military blind man.
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,1,"I made an account just so I could write a review of this terrible movie. I don't know how it could have a 7+ rating. The plot line of this movie is so absurd, I had a difficult time trying to stay focused.I don't care if this guy was an ex-marine/green beret/ranger/Bruce Lee... HE'S BLIND. I could have picked plenty of moments that the characters could have bashed him over the skull and made off with the loot. In fact, the first time the old, blind man is introduced, he is unarmed and ""Money"" has a gun on him. Yet, the blind man manages to get just close enough to engage and kill ""Money"". Why didn't ""Money"" just put one in his knee (since it's established conveniently that no one lives in a 4 block radius)or side step the guy and pistol whip him? ... Oh, right, I guess that story line wouldn't have been too interesting.Then of course, we get to the ""twist"". Which is so out of place the only logical reason it could be there, is so we have SOME way to vilify this blind old man. Ready? He has a girl locked in his basement. The girl who killed his daughter in a car ACCIDENT. Now, he's demanding she gives him another child. Giggle. Then, when things go wrong and he accidentally shoots the girl, he eventually captures ""Rocky"" (Jane Levy's character), spews some ridiculous dialogue in an extremely annoying voice, and threatens to impregnate her with a turkey baster. Seriously. The idea was cool and Jane Levy is adorable and believable. That's about the only thing positive I could say about this movie. I was expecting more based on what I had heard but, the movie as a whole was awful. It would have taken a lot more cleverness to make it believable that a blind man could adequately defend himself against three home invaders. I was happy to see other reviews which said the same. At least I know we as people haven't fallen that low just yet."
" Wow
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,10,"It as been a wile since a thriller has keep me on the edge like this one. It was incredibly well done.The story is very simple. 3 young adult are robbing the neighborhood. One is a dick, his girlfriend who needs the money to get out from under her terrible home life and a 3rd guy who is in love with her and his father works on installing security system in houses. They find out that a blind guy has a lot of money in his house and decide to rob him and then flee the state. They just don't know that he his unhinged and dangerous.There is no scare factor in this movie. But from the moment the action start, it never lets go and keeps you on the edge. The only thing I have against it is a scene around the end were the blind guy explain something. The explanation is disturbing but fine. The action, on the other end, I believe the movie could of done without it.The acting was great, the effects were good and the filming was very claustrophobic witch works for this kind of movie.All in all great and very much worth a watch if you like thrillers."
" Good movie
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,9,"I'm not so sure as of now if this is a great movie but i'm sure it's a good movie, from the jump it gives you a good footing. I'm only at the beginning of this movie, i'm 21mins in and this movie has me hooked like a fish, I want more already and i can't help but say i'm addicted so far to the movies plot it's just so damn good and so amusing when you think about all the mistakes the characters make in the beginning I can just see how beautifully things will unfold in this movie and keep me hooked like a fish Lol I can't help but keep saying i'm ""hooked like a fish"" because I am, this movie kinda reminds me of the movie ""Late Phases"" but only to a certain extent if you've seen late phases then you'll understand my comparison but if not that's OK please still review this movie because it kicks ass big time I mean so far what i've seen is awesome and I think you should see this too. Thanks!"
" Didn't like it........
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,3,"I seem to be in the minority, but I just truly did not like this film. And maybe it's just me, but using teen actors in a horror film like this always seem to be a downer. This is simply because most of them cannot act or they tend to overact and it quickly gets annoying. That was certainly the case here, with teen actors, it's just simply hard to sympathize with them from the start because their acting is so cringe-worthy. But let's talk about the film itself, shall we, the film is slow and boring, it takes about 30 minutes to get going, and when something finally does happen, it's nowhere near as intense as what it looks like. The fact that the bad guy is blind, what is that supposed to contribute to the film? Is it supposed to make the viewers feel sorry for him? What's the point of making a handicap for the bad guy? What, if he wasn't blind, he would have been able to easily see them and kill them? It makes no sense. In Hush, for example, even though I didn't like that film that much either, but it made sense to game the girl deaf because she was running from the bad guy, and it made the film more intense as they used the fact that she was deaf quite well in some scenes. But what is the point of making this guy blind, to add something unique to t he film? Fair enough, but to make him blind just takes out the fun a in a film like this. The fact that he is blind acts NOTHING to this film. I'll end saying this, I can't really pin-point why I did not like this film. But, like I said, I found it slow and boring, and I never like teenage actors in horror films. In comedy films, they are fine, but in horror films, their acting never ever matches up, and you hardly ever feel sorry for them."
" Absolutely ANNOYING. An Insult to intellect & common sense
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,1,"I have never bothered to write a review for any movie (good or bad) until now.I've watched some very artsy weird indie movies, and a lot more awful mainstream movies, but this one compelled me to react because of its UNDESERVED rating & glowing reviews! I can't remember the last time a movie annoyed the hell out of me by its sheer stupidity. I am appalled at how it begs you to suspend disbelief, insulting your intelligence throughout, and offering no redeeming quality whatsoever. I know it's ""just a movie"", we're asked to set aside logic and believe the unbelievable for the sake of enjoyment, BUT the stupidity made it difficult to enjoy. and the story is not even fantasy, sci-fi or anything supernatural to warrant extreme suspension of disbelief. This is just a BURGLARY OF THE MOST EPIC MORONIC PROPORTIONS it's almost a comedy. I would even count an alien invasion more realistic than this preposterous plot!The movie revolved around the UTTER STUPIDITY of those 3 lowlifes. Don't get me started on the old blind man who seemed to be Daredevil gone mental (who turns on lights in his house he couldn't even see). He might actually be a mutant, that's how he managed to pull off everything. And of course they had to force in a disgusting scene just to bring some so-called twist to somehow salvage their horrible plot and lack of decent script, it's pathetic and desperate.I hated ALL the characters, especially the dumb EVIL greedy gold-digging hypocritical woman who would sacrifice her soul and others for money. and she's supposed to be the protagonist?? what a joke. I wanted her to be tortured. There is NO ONE you could root for, no one you would want to stay alive, except maybe for the dog. Had the dog massacred the woman I would've been a tiny bit satisfied but no, the absurdity continued to its pathetic conclusion that had me wishing someone could've just dropped a bomb at the start and be done with them all.This is not about some minor plot holes we can overlook. The whole thing, yes the WHOLE THING is so RIDICULOUS that try as you may to shut off your brain from protesting, it's just not possible, at least not for me."
" Totally implausible, but somehow it works
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,6,"Classified as crime/horror/thriller, I consider it more like an intense action movie with many violent scenes and some scares, but not horror.Three criminals, two men (Alex and Money) and one woman (Rocky), decide to rob the home of a blind man who apparently is not as defenseless as he looks, being a former decorated war veteran.Despite the implausibility of this whole scenario (you really need to see it to believe it, believe me!!!) and the ambiguous and dubious message, the camera work and the acting are of such a great level (mainly the blind man) that it truly works against all odds, creating a constant feeling of tension and claustrophobia. All these are strong aspects that carry this movie in a good direction, as well as the fact of all the characters being antagonistic, with none of them being a hero of the moral virtues. Moreover, and even because of this, this movie divides the spectators opinions creating intense discussions, which is always a good thing :) - hence I score it a little higher than I should: 6/10."
" If you don't find this nerve-wracking then you haven't got a pulse
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,8,"A trio of thieves decide to rob the home of an ex-army Gulf war veteran whom has received $300,000 dollars in compensation which he has stashed in his home. The thieves see this guy as being easy pickings due to him ending up being blind as a result of serving in the Gulf War, but this homeowner isn't prepared to surrender his home or his money without a fight and our trio find themselves faced with a deadly adversary...Don't Breathe is a wonderful film whereby its very excellence lies with its simplicity; it's another home-invasion thriller and at no point does it try to be anything else (it can hardly be accused of re-inventing the wheel). However, from the moment the thieves enter the victim's home the film never lets up and director Fede Alvarez keeps things moving at a rapid rate. The idea that the victim is blind only helps to crank the tension up and helps to keep the viewer on edge - I found myself looking and listening out for the slightest sound which may cause the homeowner to rumble the thieves.Alvarez wisely keeps the direction tight and fluid and most of the focus lies on the thieves and their perilous journey to escape from a man that they feel that they shouldn't have tried to rob in the first place.In some ways Don't Breathe is an odd film from a viewing perspective as you find yourself unsure who exactly you should be rooting for; you can't really root for the thieves (for obvious reasons) and part of you wants to root for the victim, but some twists later in the film kind of make it hard to do this as well. So what you need to do with this film is just go with the flow and sit back and enjoy this claustrophobic, terrifying and nerve-shredding thriller that basically grips you from start to finish and try not to get bogged down with any moral ambiguities.Simply put this is a top-drawer home-invasion thriller which kept me on the edge-of-my-seat and helped me restore some faith in a genre that has produced rather mixed results over the years."
" New Hollywood and the Youth of Today
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,2,"So we're supposed to feel bad for the multicultural millennial's who decide they are going to commit burglaries on people they deem to be unworthy of their wealth and success. Forgive me for not shedding a tear when these criminals get knocked off one by one. Isn't the whole point that we're supposed to have likable protagonists? In my opinion the ""creep"" excuse me burglary victim in this movie IS the protagonist.This is how Hollywood now tries to indoctrinate the youth of America to their leftist agenda. They are now bending the rules by making ""edgy"", ""underprivileged"" youth out to be the ones who are in the ""right"" by committing acts of crime against the ""over-privileged."" This is the leftist, Marxist agenda working at it's best. I guess as long as these youth aren't breaking into Hollywood mansions it's okay. Total political BS. I'm tired of seeing movies with a ""message"". This is why all movies that are made today are terrible. It's not the acting, the story, the cameras. It's the hidden liberal agenda. Or hidden Chi-com agenda. I think I'll stick to watching movies made pre-millennium."
" A hit and miss
",2017-08-18 00:00:00,5,"PROS: Some pros were the seamlessly thought out plot lines, and the perfectly executed marketing. The ability to make a film appear watchable is half the battle. It takes a creative idea and a good budget, and they used every penny wisely. When I watched the trailer, or read the reviews, I was very intrigued. That is a big pro. And when I actually started to watch the movie I got even more impressed by the way everything was thought out. Not a single detail was missed. The script was very precise and left no knot untied.CONS: The biggest issue lied with the way the movie was built up. There was so many high moments it was difficult to find a climax. You ended up getting bored because you were already at your highest point, and they just kept going higher and higher to a point that you couldn't keep up with them. The movie felt like it went from 0 to 100 and you got left behind. And the whole time you were hoping that the movie would come to a solid resolution, but no. You were left with an unwanted ending that helped no one understand the movie better or keep you guessing. It was disappointing to say the least.www.chorror.com"
" Twisted and unrealistic
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,3,"The intruders' ability to live up to the movie's title is highly unrealistic. The man does all kinds of stuff that should startle them but absurdly doesn't. They remain freakishly silent. Of course they flinch but come on, even when the landline suddenly rings, which causes him to fire a bullet at the phone, which is near her FEET, they manage to not make a peep?? That's B.S. to the max. And what it all comes down to is that the movie's trying to make these people out to be the GOOD guys."
" I created an account for this...
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,2,"This movie was so shockingly bad that I created an IMDb account simply so I could write a review...not only that - I also put down my smartphone and logged in via Desktop so I could post it!I sit through most films until the bitter end no matter how dire, but I had to implement a strong 3 strikes policy with ""Don't Breathe"", and I made it to around the 42nd minute mark!**Strike 1** The 3 kids are able to break into these lavish houses because the main protagonist's father owns a security company that manages the security of these homes. How does the kid gain access? Well, luckily the head of said security company leaves all the keys, access codes and addresses of his clients in the desk drawer of his unlocked office. Don't worry though - the desk drawer is locked! Only...the key is located 30cm away from the drawer...don't worry though - the key is hidden! Hidden?! Nothing says head of a home security company like hiding a key in a lamp!**Strike 2** Why do they decide to rob the main house at night? We already know that the house is located in the ""ghost part of town"" (so that we can feel the fear of isolation later, where no one can hear you scream...or groan), and so why didn't they perform the robbery during the day when the old man isn't home - as we saw in the example of the first robbery!**Strike 3** When the blind man flips the kill switch to turn off all the lights in the house - effectively ""levelling the playing field"" - you're suddenly brought to reality with a shudder: why did a blind man have the lights on in his house in the first place?And that's ignoring the question of how a blind man kidnapped and imprisoned a healthy adult woman in his basement, why the kids didn't just go straight out the front door or through a window, or why they didn't hit, trip or trick the blind pensioner...."
" So tensed film!
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,9,"I was excited from the first to the end! I could not stop watching through!A group of young people make a plan to rob a house which a blind man lives of a lot of money. However this inhabitant was the military at one time and then he lost his eyes. Although his eyes cannot be used, he has strong skills to fight and shoot. However the group of robbers is off guard. They venture the theft without a weapon. And the blind man also makes a dangerous plan in secret...This film is shot mainly in the house, but the contents are very deep and the audience may enjoy themselves sufficiently. It makes me keep tensing though the opponent to the robbers is not ghost but the blind man because the moment he notices that somebody enter his house, he nails all the escape. So I felt the endless fear. The blind man kills the intruder one after another. I have stated that he is like the worst person, but I cannot necessarily say so. I think that a woman in the group of the robbers is bad person. Why do I think so? If you want to know the reason, I want you to watch this movie. This film is given a picture of the madness of people."
" Soccer mom thriller
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,6,"I decided to watch this movie because it had an 7.2 rating, which is unusual for a thriller/horror movie. I do not think it deserves a 7.2 rating.The film avoids the most obvious clichés, which is good.Without saying too much, I will point out that there are a couple of things about the plot that doesn't make sense, and it ends with a very obvious religious moralizing message.I think this movie deserves at most a rating of 6."
" Rating: A
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,9,"There's no way to describe how tense and suspenseful is this movie. Everything that I could possibly write here would come out as an understatement to how awesome is the quality of this film.I don't even have to be specific and go through each section that makes a movie since everything is near perfection: direction, sound, editing, the cast's performances, characters, ... I could go on and on, but it's no use. I love it! I was constantly on the edge of my seat!I found myself holding my breath as well as the characters when the blind man (played excellently by Stephen Lang) would pass by them, the thrilling building suspense to a scare (a REAL scare) kept me so captivated that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen! When they start to discover who the man really is and what he's capable of, the level of fear increases dramatically as our burglars, especially Rocky (Jane Levy) and Alex (Dylan Minnette) who are played by two amazing actors, try to escape this clearly not defenseless man.My only issue with this movie and there one thing that keeps it from being an A+ is the ending. Without spoiling anything, there's a part when it cuts to black and I thought to myself ""Perfect. Let's go home to write an awesome review"" ... And then it fades back in. The next few minutes don't add anything to the story and it can actually leave you frustrated like it left me. It's the only reason why I can't give this one the maximum rating.Still, this is by far the most suspenseful, thrilling and scaring movie that I've seen this year, with all its elements near perfection, but an ending that doesn't do justice to the amazing film that was created.

" Not Horror? you still might want to leave the lights on.
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,7,"I keep reading reviews where people complain that this is not truly a Horror film, and although technically true, Don't Breathe still has plenty of tense and frighting moments and should still be watched at night with the lights out. The story is simple in a good way, what happens when a group a thieves try to rob a blind man in his own home? Ultimately most of the characters are unlikable and has some moments that make you suspend your disbelief however Don't Breathe uses some of your own preconceived notions in its favor. When darker secrets are revealed your sense of morality will be questioned and in the end you will be left wondering if everyone deserved what they got."
" How difficult is it to distract a guy who tracks sounds
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,3,"Note that this review contains spoilers.I probably would have enjoyed this movie, however as any one who has enjoyed any movie knows... you want the movie to be realistic.I'm not one of those who are stuck up about loop holes in movie scripts, but I do expect the plot not to be easily figured out by me or else it will bug me through the movie.The plot of this movie is that this blind man tracks the sound(s) made by these invaders of his residential domain, clearly he is very attentive to the sounds they make while they move about his house and they are not oblivious to this as they repeatedly suffer the consequences of providing him with sounds made by their movement which he follows, beating and butchering them.On the other hand, all about them litter loose objects and tools with which they could toss to an empty part of the house to distract him from them. Also tools abound with which they could quietly incapacitate him. The only thing is, they never even try to do this. Instead they keep on leading him to where they are for his vengeance to easily find them and mete out maximum punishments on them.This could definitely have been an interesting ride... but alas I enjoyed it not."

Turns out the retiree is somewhat unhinged, with a disturbing secret.What I like about this is the action starts early and hurtles along.

" Seriously?
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,3,"When I watched this movie it was because it got 7.2 stars here on IMDb. But it was so bad, I seriously do not understand why it get this good ratings. The whole story does nothing special and especially does not make sense. 3 guys go for 300K and don't seem to get to an agreement until the girl needs to be helped out of her unpleasant life. From there on out it goes wrong. The motivation is wrong, the clichés are wrong, the backstory of the blind guy they want to rob is wrong. How does a blind guy get a girl trapped in his basement, saying 'rich girls never go to jail', but he can keep her in his own home, and cops never go look for her in his house even though he's suspect number 1 because she killed his daughter in an accident. I am still wondering how I ever came to end this movie. The dog in car part took too long, him finding her eventually was ridiculous. You know what, if you want to spend 1.5 hours of your life wasting it on a bad movie, this should be a good pick for you. end of rant."

A strong start and building of the main character and then when the movie suddenly turns the first time you still find you're in familiar territory. But then a further turn and suddenly the movie takes you into unknown territory and you're questioning who you need to root for. Well worth a watch.
" Another Horror Plot Hole Film
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,3,"Anyone with half a brain will be able to see through the many ridiculous plot holes of this very poorly done film. I only don't give this movie a 1 because of how much some idiot spent making it, and the people who legitimately put in the hard work trying to polish this turd film. The film starts with some scummy thieves making a plan to break into some old veterans house who lives in the ghetto and steal a bunch of insurance money. Fast forward through a film full of blatant plot holes, horrible continuity, and a 60+ year old super hero blind rapist man who can take direct hits from sledgehammers to the face and still be able to not only shoot accurately but escape from handcuffs by flexing and busting out. Don't forget crazy old rapists superhero docompanion who can teleport free of chains and is able to digest large amounts of sleeping meds with little to no side effects. SPOILERS:The ending is also ridiculous and full of holes. Multiple homicides and the FBI doesn't find the rape dungeon with bodies in the floor? Somehow superhero rapist man gets off free. LMFAO. The jump scares in this film aren't even that good and that's all it has going for it. If you're into fantasy horror films that hold little to no footing in reality this isn't too horrible of a film.If you like films that have a sense of reality in them then don't waste your time."

The story is mixed with many suspense elements that will take your breath away. All the actors delivered a respectable and believable performance. The director created a perfect nail-biter. It was non stop and fast paced that lets open even a sequel. Give it a chance. If you like this genre of movie don't miss Panic Room, Trapped, The General's Daughter, 8mm or Flight Plan. My vote is 7 and my wife' gave 6 that matches the actual one on IMDb: 7/10."
" A fun and nerve wrecking little horror classic
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,8,"I don't really go to see the independent movies in theaters, but the cast and the premise for this movie was more than appealing to me. Stephen Lang I've known since Avatar, Jane Levy I've known since the Evil Dead remake, and I like Dylan Minnette who was previously in the Ghostbusters movie with Jack Black. To me this film had the same tone and appeal ""It Follows"" did, but whereas that film built up the tension, Don't Breathe felt like it had a pulse, every time you think it'll die down the tension and fear smacks you in the face, leaving no time to relax. The film centres around a group of three young home invaders who decide to target the home of an old blind war veteran, who they know has a large sum of money stored in his home, the last inhabited home in a rundown Detroit neighborhood. Little do they know, this blind old man is far from helpless, and a simple home invasion quickly becomes a nightmare.That alone got me hooked. Finding out the director of Don't Breathe Fede Alvarez had also directed the Evil Dead remake, I knew I'd be in for a surprise, and I wasn't disappointed. There are so many ways the situation could have been avoided in a typical horror film like this, but Alvarez made make perfect care to quickly negate any of these options; the characters have to be fast on their feet and know how to handle the situation before Lang's character finds them. At no point was I rolling my eyes and finding ways the director could have made a scene better; everything fits into place. Now there probably was a few times the characters made stupid decisions, but considering it wasn't in their position, I forgave them being too panicked to think properly. I wish more of these independent movies would be produced to wash out all of the found footage tripe we get each year. I want horror films to respect the audience instead of treating us like we're stupid.I give this movie a 9 out of 10"
" solid genre thriller
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,8,"Rocky (Jane Levy), Alex (Dylan Minnette), and Money (Daniel Zovatto) have been breaking in the remaining mansions of the devastated neighborhoods in Detroit. Rocky is desperate to get enough money to leave for California. Alex has a crush on her and uses his security knowledge. He sets specific limitations to avoid long prison terms. Money gets a tip on a blind veteran (Stephen Lang) who received a large legal settlement. The trio finds him a scary opponent despite his handicap.Fede Alvarez delivers a solid genre thriller. He is unrelenting in the tension and injects enough twists to keep the audience on their toes. Alex with his puppy love probably has the most rooting interest. Rocky is a terribly flawed protagonist. Jane Levy is an appealing actress who keeps the role from falling into villainy. Stephen Lang is a force of nature who brings a truly fearsome power. This is a well-made thriller."
" An upsetting end with gaps
",2017-06-15 00:00:00,5,"For the first half I considered it a thriller nicely done, up to a point. It's certainly got some logic gaps that you have to ignore, and things like 'why this blind ex-military man has all this money is he on the only house on an abandoned area in Detroit city block with no one else living there. there seemed no proper logic that why despite of many chances the woman did not attack the blind man, and get rid off the house."
" Watch it, but don't expect too much.
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,4,"This movie is about 3 thieves who decided to steal a house owned by an old-wealthy man. And as you see it looks like an easy robbery, but no, you're wrong, when they broke into the house, the situation changed, and they became the victims who were looking for a way to escape.The movie started by introducing the main characters and what they want to do with the stolen money, and all the following scenes were just fine,there was some thrill and I was really excited, until they broke into the house, the movie started to be very illogical, which I think is the worst thing in it.Directing was good, acting too, especially The Blind Man (Stephen Lang), he was one of the reasons that made me watch the movie till the ending, but all of that was not enough to cover the boring scenes and illogical events.At the end, I think Don't Breathe was not good, not bad either. I didn't regret watching it, but definitely I won't watch it again, my final score for it is 4/10. After all, I think it worth watching."
" Don't bother
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,5,"Sometimes a films sounds better on paper than it does when it's actually in front of you. I'd vaguely heard of the film 'Don't Breathe.' I knew it was a horror film and found out enough about the plot to interest me. It's about a trio of youths who like to spend their days burgling houses. Yes, a real group of protagonists you can identify with and root for – NOT! Okay, so the female of the three is okay-ish. We get enough backstory regarding her wanting to help out her family and take them away to a better future, but you can't really get around the fact that they steal things for a living.Therefore, one day they think they're in for a 'free lunch' when they decide to break into a house that stands all on its own with the promise of great rewards to come. However, things don't go entirely to plan when it turns out that the old man who lives there is not someone you want to mess with (or even know!). Imagine breaking into Jason Voorhees' sitting room and you're sort of in the right area. Basically, what starts out as a routine cash grab turns into the three being stalked mercilessly for their lives.So, it kind of sounds interesting, i.e. turning the initial bad guys into the unwitting victims. Sadly, it just didn't work out for me. As you've probably guessed, I didn't care much for the three kids and felt that the way we were supposed to care for the girl felt forced just so we feel something for her eventual plight. Plus there was the fact that I never really bought into the fact that they were unable to escape from a house. This isn't some giant country mansion with sprawling corridors and secret passageways. It's not far off your average detached house you'd see on most streets (I had the same complaint for the horror film 'The Collector!'). Then there was the way it was generally shot – it was too damn dark! I know that darkness goes hand in hand with horror movies and that it's a film-maker's tool to add atmosphere to the generally grim feel, but I just found I couldn't make out what was going on! All in all, if you don't watch an awful lot of horror films and just feel like something that's a little dark with a few jump scares and token blood and gore, then this will probably foot the bill. However, if – like me – you've seen every kind of maniac wear every kind of hockey mask despatching every type of teenage in every style of gruesome fashion, then this really doesn't offer enough that's new to really leave an impact. Yup, pretty much already forgotten most of it."
" There's more than the ... eye can see
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,8,"Pun very much intended, but let's not get carried away too much. The guy who remade the Evil Dead does Horror Thriller and he has a very stellar cast in his corner. Especially Stephen Lang is phenomenal in a different and very demanding role. His screen presence is great and you can understand certain things that are happening. Or how he and the others react to be more exact.Having said that, there are still some odd clichés here and there. But never mind those and enjoy the thrill ride, because this really is quite breath taking. Although the title obviously is referencing something different. Doing something bad, may not be as evil as it seems ..."
" Review – Don't Breathe (2016) ..90 minutes of cleverly crafted tension and thrills! [3.5/5]
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,7,"Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez (who gained popularity through his underwhelming debut feature which happened to be the reboot of the Sam Raimi classic 'Evil Dead') returns strongly and leaves a lasting impression with the home-invasion thriller ""Don't Breathe"". It is about a group of three thieves who wanna fulfill their American dream of making big money and moving to a big city. In order for this to happen though, the trio must rob the house of a blind man (played to the hilt by Stephen Lang of 'Avatar').The proceedings that take place over the course of that one night actually take up a bulk of the film and this is precisely where the writer/director has shown immense potential in thrilling, terrifying and shocking the viewer. ""Don't Breathe"" isn't a film that relies purely on jump scares but the few ones present are placed at apt junctures and bring in the required impact. The atmosphere is spine- chilling, set mostly within the confines of a house that is located quite far away from the bustling city in a crumbling uninhabited neighborhood, so we the audience are told in advance that noise is not going to gather any public attention. But hey, the 'blind man' in the house isn't a weakling either. He's aroused quickly by even the quaintest of creaks or the sound of exhaling breath. What happens when he springs into action to defend himself and the reveal of a certain personal mystery regarding the blind dude apart from the money that the trio want to get their hands on, is played out in sixty-plus minutes of totally ruthless, claustrophobia-inducing frenzy. Stephen Lang is nothing short of tremendous, and plays the 'blind man' in near- flawless fashion. The guy's got amazing screen- presence. The trio played by Jane Levy (of the 'Evil Dead' reboot), Dylan Minnette (of 'Goosebumps') and Daniel Zovatto (of 'It Follows') are quite impressive as well with the former two occupying more screen-time (due to the nature of the screenplay!).The cinematography is solid (close-up shots in the pitch-dark portion stood out!) and although this is a film that involves a lot of physicality, and perspective-juggling, Pedro Luque handles it brilliantly (no shaky cam!). The storyline is not something that is completely original; if you simply go through the synopsis, you are bound to feel as if this film could be a cliché-filled exercise in torture-porn ( a relentless rehash of the magnificent Jeremy Saulnier thriller 'Green Room', offering cheap thrills like in 'The Collector' and bucketfuls of gore like in 'Saw'.) but Fede Alvarez gives you a completely engaging cinematic piece that tries to bend the viewers' minds in the quirkiest ways possible. The Sound and Editorial department deserve special praise.Once the trio breaks into the house, the viewer is constantly kept on the edge of the seat largely owing to the excellent performances, a screenplay that is determined to shell out thrill after thrill after thrill (maybe a few loopholes here and there but doesn't matter), fantastic sound design and some clever direction. Honestly, I did not find Fede's 'Evil Dead' reboot impressive at all (felt that the shock value was less dependent on characters or atmosphere but on excessive gore-spill), so I did not have really high expectations about this flick. This time however, it's a completely different scenario. Along with Mike Flanagan and Dan Trachtenberg, Fede Alvarez is going to occupy a spot on my list of favorite thriller directors of 2016.The less you know about the movie, the better. Enjoy this R-rated thriller and get your adrenaline pumping to good effect!"

" Breath if you dare
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,7,"(Good) horror movies are back! Finally! Lately we can enjoy horror (or thriller) movies that really gives us chills, and this is one of them!!More than a horror movie I would say this movie is a thriller movie, because more than getting scared you get stressed out, like really stressed out. The whole movie. Believe me. Yes, the three guys are supposed to be the bad guys as they are trespassing a private property but cannot but feel pity for them when the hunter becomes the prey.The movie has a good rhythm, not for a moment the stress does stop, maybe too much for our nerves, but everything has a reason to be. The only weak point it the reason behind all this (there is always a hidden reason) because is nothing special, kind of expected, but there is indeed a really disgusting situation which I will not mention but if you watch the movie you will know which I am talking about, and it is something that is not so normal.If you want to be frightened, then go watch this movie, there is no alien, no monster, unless you count human beings as monster, which is the sense of all this"
" The real horror is here
",2017-05-29 00:00:00,3,"In this awfully dumb movie all of the rules of a good horror have been broken or ignored. As a result: 1) The thieves are involved in kind of competition of ineptitude and stupidity. 2) It's is impossible to feel any empathy with such morons. 3) The blind man is not only blind, but most of the time seems to be deaf, which is impressive, given his ability to defend himself. 4) The mix of natural and supernatural horror is appalling. 5) The dialogues may have been written by someone of the janitorial service who was hanging around there when the script was... I don't know what. 6) Everything happen at the wrong time in the wrong moment. 7) etc."
" Cruel and unusual
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,7,"In some ways it is similar to Green Room in that's its technically suspense thriller, but directed like a horror movie, until it eventually becomes one.Suffers from the obvious problem of the premise: no likeable characters. At its best the movie very surprisingly transcends this limitation with relentless suspense and some truly unexpected and horrifying surprises. At its worst it feels like a tedious exercise in depraved masochism.It is even more stylish than the director's previous efforts in Evil Dead. Beautifully photographed. I'll give it a 7/10 in spite of its fundamental flaws. Glad I took the time to watch it."
" Great Film, writing, acting with many times you think it over, but then?
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,9,"I didn't read the user reviews prior to watching, the IMDb write up and it's average user score was enough for me, well, what a fantastic movie, credit due to the writers and directors and of course the small 4 many actors. Don't let the number of cast put you off, this movie (trying hard not to give anything away) has so many twists and turns, just when you are happy with your choice nearing the end of the film, then ""POW"" smack in the face, again and again. I can't say much more than the IMDb write up of a group of youths involved in petty crime decide to rob a War Veteran whom lost his only daughter in a car accident with rumors of a big pay out. The veteran is also blind so, they think him an easy target. Yes you are thinking what I did, classic of a trained veteran turning the tables, well think again as this movie is so much more and worth the time to watch it. I would say that a prequel would be a welcome addition and even a sequel would be worth a look. I will be watching out in the hop the make a new movie. Also if this is the type of quality film the directors and writers put out, again they will be on my watch list. Congratulations on a great movie, I would like to give a 8.5 but I can't do that, so it is worth a 9."

",2017-05-15 00:00:00,4,"Wow, what a waste of talent. I finally saw this when it came on cable, what a disappointment. The story plot of a trio going to rob a blind veteran that lost his daughter automatically has you despising the characters. Predictably they underestimate their target and walk into a booby trapped house. But the blind guy apparently hasn't had his sense of smell overcompensate for his blindness because he can't smell them hiding right under his nose while sweating bullets. A lot of cat and mouse and then the added introduction of weirdness finding out the blind guy isn't anyone to root for either. A better ending would have been for the final character to have not escaped w/the money. They are planning a sequel. Can't imagine where you go from this mess. If you want to see a good booby trapped house movie see The Collector."
" Amazing
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,10,"Great suspense cinematography and acting. Dillion Minett, Stephen Lang, and especially Jane Levey all deliver great performances and edge of you of your seat suspense! Its a really funny and scary movie with a very satisfying ending I highly recommend you see this with friends just to see their reaction its great!"
" Don't Breathe is very enjoyable, just don't call it original
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,7,"There is no denying that Don't Breathe is a thrilling ride expertly produced and directed. Fede Alvarez' last outing is a must-see remake of Evil Dead, so much more visceral than the original. With Don't Breathe, there is a clear departure from the all-out gore and horror of his previous picture, the marketing campaign would make you think this is a horror movie, it is a thriller with very little blood on screen, all the potential gore has been replaced by the tense and engaging set pieces.This is not an original affair, we've all been there before: home invasion gone wrong, people-are-not-what-they-seem, twists, jump scares, final girl, more twists, etc. However (and this is a big however), the technical execution is faultless, the plot, the pace, the visuals, the sound, all these elements are pulling you in regardless of the initial motivation to watch the film.Do watch Don't Breathe and enjoy it for what it is.Delve deeper and we will find issues. The biggest one is the script with dialogues serving their purpose and a flawless structure, the problem resides in the lack of character development particularly for the young protagonists, we find ourselves struggling to root for these individuals, we don't really get a chance to know and care for them, we are mere witnesses to some youths trying to get out of a horrible situation.Besides the blindness of the antagonist, Don't Breathe is a barely disguised remake or, let's call it, a carbon copy of ""The People under the stairs"": social commentary on American economic despair, maze- like suburban house, street-wise burglars, dark secret in the basement, air vent chases,... Blimey, all the way down to the rottweiler... Do I need to say more?Don't let the above issues spoil it, Don't Breathe is a very enjoyable thrilling ride perfectly executed and absolutely watchable but, please, don't call it original."
" It is an okay creepy horror rated-R film I enjoy it
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,8,"It is an okay horror film that I enjoyed and I like it, but in my opinion I think The People Under the Stairs and The Collector are way much better horror movies. I appreciate for what director Fede Álvarez did. I hated Evil Dead remake I though it was poorly paced and really boring movie except the ending. Jane Levy did really fine solid job as the hero I really love the movie has happy ending and Stephen Lang as the villain was good I know him from The Fugitive TV series (2000). I already saw the horror movies before about burglars breaking in the house and find them self's been the target and locked in the house. For my opinion The Collector is just much way better movie even The People Under the Stairs are just way much better movies.I do have one problem: I wish the movie would had more booby traps, I wish the death scenes would be more gory, it is a rated-R horror film, but still it was a good film, fast paced really intense and you keep rooting for the bad guys.Their sure-fire break-and-enter scheme provides them with steady income, but delinquents Rocky, Alex and Money keep hoping for a bigger score. Their wishes are granted when Money receives a tip about an enormous sum of cash rumored to be stashed in a home in a desolate suburb of Detroit belonging to a blind, solitary Iraq War veteran. A B&E plan is hatched and quickly put into motion. What could possibly go wrong? Although it was a bit lightweight and featured ethically-challenged protagonists, this was a decent-enough suspense flick.I didn't expect for this to be as good as it was. I was expecting a cheap thriller (this only had a budget of around $1 million) that did nothing for the viewers. I was not expecting to get goosebumps. This movie is twisted you got three idiots breaking in to somebody's house that is stupid, so we are going to root for the blind man - wrong: you will root for these three guys, when you find out what the blind guy has hiding in his house type of crazy weird sh**t going on in this movie and when they find out later on the end of the movie this is twisted creepy horror and I loved it.I love Don't Breathe this movie was thought out, well written, every little things let in to something else. I like that and I like someone thought that out I like that. One is on the other location and he can't see it. Fede Álvarez did a good job better than Evil Dead the blind man was great and really creepy and scary the thrills are there and they work good. It is my favorite 2016 horror film and I like it, I thought it was an okay and fun movie. I liked Acting is great, the story is top notch and it gives you the edge of your seat. I would not compared this movie with Panic Room because Panic Room was also a great flick as well. It both has the same amount of way. I enjoyed this movie since Panic Room.The ending was solid I love that Rocky survived she was not only sole survivor but Jane Levy's character was decent, she was breaking in to me someone else's house only to feed her young sister, they both have a messed up family and her mom is beating her, she survives and she takes her sister away but the blind man survives anyway. It is fast paced but in my personal opinion I like The Collector much more I thought Arkin (Josh Stewart) was much smart and way better protagonist. My rating is 8/10 solid B I like the movie in three weeks I am getting this movie on Blu-ray disc.Don't Breathe is a 2016 American horror-thriller film directed by Fede Álvarez and written by Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues. The film stars Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto, and Stephen Lang, and focuses on three friends who get trapped inside a blind man's house while breaking into it.8/10 Grade: B Studio: Screen Gems Stage 6 Films Starring: Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto, Stephen Lang Director: Fede Álvarez Producers: Fede Álvarez, Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert Writers: Fede Álvarez, Rodo Sayagues Rated: R Running Time: 1Hr. 28 Mins.

" Really liked this movie besides the ending
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,8,"Since they got rid of the B.B. boards I will write this out to the required number equivalent.Heard good word of mouth about this movie but waited and just watched it last night. It is well done, produced, acted, and have no complaints on that. The suspense and that feeling I got from claustrophobia trying to get out of a place like the characters would be a nightmare.The blind guy acted by someone I have never heard was amazing and I loved how it kept you guessing. To be stuck in a place like that when I kept thinking, how do you get out and the noise factor to a blind man was very original. He lost his daughter, it never says how he got his million or I don't get how they to the code to his safe which brings me to my point.How in ending when they find the kidnapped ""rich"" girl as they never go to jail as he puts it, would the police not find her in the bondage gear she was in and that room and not put two to two together about the blind mans daughter. It is the only plot hole but it is the ending and it would of been much better in my opinion if he just died or was in a coma.Anyway, enjoyed it but the ending just bugs me. Is it set up for a sequel I'm guessing with what it made domestically? It's also hard to see that actor who gets shot opening the door and not think of 13 reasons why and his role in it after 10 plus hours of viewing that well made series."
" A very good movie
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,8,"This movie together with Train to Busan and Lights Out were the best horror flicks of 2016. In my opinion Don't Breathe takes first in the suspense department. It's a very well thought out movie, smart in it's turns and twists and the audience never gets much rest. In fact it's not often I see horror this well crafted. I also like the ending for obvious reasons. The only negative was that he wasn't allowed to inject the creamy shot... That would have been hilarious!"
" Disappointed Horror film
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,1,"Don't Breathe falls under the category of The Stepfather 2009 and Disturbia 2007 of basic thriller film nothing worth looking back until the next Hollywood blockbuster thriller movie comes out. This film plays it safe delivering the horror; It's really sad because horror use to be my favorite genre. Don't Breathe capture the genre of it being a thriller well like giving the audience that suspense excitement of what happens next. But Don't Breathe fell to bring the horror this movie won't be a horror classic like The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984),The Exorcist (1973), Halloween (1978), The Thing 1982 and Friday the 13th. I feel like the horror genre is dying to many filmmakers is playing it safe in not using creature mix with gore and good storytelling for this movie it's basic and forgettable nothing worth remembering because we get another serial killer instead of a new iconic villain or characters that stands out to remember. Don't Breathe gave another house invasion which I've seen dozen of times in a thriller movie; instead of good storytelling like horror movies. Maybe I've grown out of the horror genre completely and nothing scare me anymore. To many thriller movies not enough horror movies."
" Don't Breathe
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,3,"***Spoilers Ahead, Maybe*** Don't Breathe wasn't as good as I hoped or thought it would be.The best thing thing about this movie was the trailer.When I saw it, I thought that movie looks awesome.It's what made me want to see Don't Breathe in the 1st place.After watching the movie I was disappointed.It was nothing spectacular & it wasn't something I'd add to my GARBAGE list either but I felt like I was watching it just to be watching it.Right from the start when the 3 teens were breaking into the 1st house they broke into & Money was masturbating onto the floor, I thought how stupid is that? What was the point? Was this suppose to show he was the idiot of the group? Is he that stupid that he doesn't know by doing that, he's leaving his DNA at the scene which could be traced back to him & eventually lead to the arrest of the 3 of them? Am I reading too much into this movie? As for the final break in, the BIG $$$ score that would be getting them out of Michigan & California bound, Who are we to feel sorry for? The 3 teens who break into a blind man's home because they get a tip that there's $$$ inside & what happens to them after? Which wouldn't have happened to them if they weren't robbing houses in the 1st place or the blind man who lost a daughter after she was run over by a rich girl who didn't spend a day in jail & got off with a settlement so he kidnaps her & keeps her chained up in the basement to produce a daughter for him? Who do you feel sorry for? Is this what the movie wants us to consider? Is there a deeper meaning? Was Don't Breathe better than what I thought?"
" Utter Suspense
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,9,"I was really bored when I started watching this movie and I just wanted to kill some time. I got hooked up after the first 15 minutes or something. The director put hell of an effort into this movie, and the 4 main characters played their roles in a very good way, especially Stephen Lang, who was simply brilliant. You start by feeling bad for this man, and then you end up feeling absolutely different! The movie is great and would steal your attention, mind and thoughts and let you sit there helplessly as the characters move inside the house. Nothing in the movie is cheesy or lame or nonsense... You would love it..."
" Just two missing ties in this story
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,6,"As I said , two missing spot and the most important ... why the police didn't investigate the abduction... in that case the old man is always the principal reference... but this is an original and not complicated history. As I said , two missing spot and the most important ... why the police didn't investigate the abduction... in that case the old man is always the principal reference... but this is an original and not complicated history."
" A well set up movie that disappoints with a ridiculous number of implausible twists
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,4,There are only so many implausible and 'shocking' twists a thriller like this can take and 'Don't Breath' goes well above and beyond this limit. I thought the first quarter of the film was well set up only to become more and more ridiculous as the protagonists try to navigate out of their situation.
" Sam Raimi's hand
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,8,"Shocking Thriller where suspense can almost touch, a breathless movie. Great rhythm, amazing screenplay, use of highlights and shadows as well as the color palette used by wise photography. A few dialogues and a lot of action. Sam Raimi's hand in production can be seen here. Good cast."
" Seeing in Believing
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,8,Rented this movie recently and wow it kept me on edge the entire time. Like many movies of this genre you have to wonder why the people involved in the story never really make sure that the heavy in the movie is never really dead. That's movie logic for you. Actor Stephen Lang is really effective as the old man in the story. He typically plays bad guys so it's easy to root against him after the characters are established. The only thing I can say is this movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and is worth seeing.
" Very suspenseful film, that will leave you on the edge of your seat!
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,9,"Very unsettling film, but that's what makes the movie great! I was on the edge of my seat biting my nails during the whole film. The acting and story were great as well as the thrill of jump scares that will actually make you jump. I love the concept of the blind man being the main antagonist of the film, it's something different that you don't normally see. Another valuable thing for the movie is that you actually care about the characters in the film especially Rocky. I love her backstory and the reason she wants to get the blind mans money (to get her and her sister out of her drug abusing mothers home). Adding to all the suspense, the delinquents also uncover something deeper about the blind man while exploring his basement, and its not very pretty. The ending also leaves the door open for a hopeful sequel. I definitely recommend this movie to horror fans who are ready to tread new ground and finally be scared once again."
" Sweet Manipulation
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,7,"There is a special arrangement exclusive to the horror/thriller genre that audiences subconsciously agree to, we want to be manipulated. If manipulation is detected in any other style, it is met with incredulity and a sneer. The makers of ""Don't Breathe"" are shameless in their understanding of this paradigm. I surprised myself in how much I was willing to overlook the lazy writing of the first 20 minutes, and the gaping plot holes of the last 60, just to feel that enthralling sensation only a good thriller can provide. If you are such a stickler to continuity and details that ""Don't Breathe"" has no effect on you, it might make you a more astute viewer, but also a more pitiable one.In simple terms this is an imperfect, but highly effective movie that sidesteps story structure to deliver one hellova setting. Once in that setting, we are given ample time to marinade in it, and believe it. 3 twenty somethings; Rocky, Alex, and Money (guess which one is the white guy with corn rows) start to grow more confident and desperate in their small burglary enterprise. Rocky is the stealthy blonde with doe eyes and small build, perfect for squeezing through tight entrances (or hiding places.) Alex is the brains and voice of reason; which doesn't amount to much as his breed of character never has enough confidence to be heard. And Money is the reckless muscle with an attitude who functions only to provide leads, break locks, and roll his eyes at good advice. When their most promising lead has a possible six-figure payday, aspirations of getting out of the gutters of Detroit bring them to a rundown suburban home with a plan that borders on incompetence. The reason for their frivolity, the target is blind. Stephen Lang is billed only as The Blind Man, a war veteran sitting on a possible fortune, hidden somewhere in a three-story pile of squeaky floorboards and crawlspaces. This house has a familiar feel, like that of ""The People Under the Stairs"" and ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" where daylight does nothing to brighten it. Knowing the present state of Detroit, it's unsettling to know this house is far from one-of-a-kind. Once our young prowlers enter, we get our first clear glimpse of the blind man. He whimpers almost pathetically with a sotto voce ""Who's There?"" His eyes don't look blind-stricken, more like something exploded from inside the eyeball. With battle scars spreading like cracked glass from the socket. After he appears in a doorway, you will find it hard to believe him as a victim. Stephen Lang is 64 with a body MMA fighters train tirelessly for. He wears a wife- beater for the duration, intimidating arms half-cocked at his sides. It becomes clear why he's not billed as the blind ""old"" man. With his loyal Rottweiler and dilapidated abode, the blind man draws on a nearly universal fear of the house around the corner you don't dare sell cookies to. As you might expect from the trailers, power roles reverse and you ping-pong between antagonists and protagonists. If the twists and turns were set only on this basis, it would still be a compelling thriller, but ""Don't Breathe"" has much more up its sleeve. There are a few moments where things stretch a bit too far for shock value, but it is praiseworthy how infrequently ""Don't Breathe"" relies on them. This is a technical achievement with beautifully choreographed long-takes and staging that you can't call natural, but certainly can't call ineffective. At 90 minutes and a $9 million budget, it's a welcome break from the 9 figure marathons Marvel produces every 9 months. And as a side note, you will undoubtedly have a few plot holes start nagging at your brain on the ride home. If you think they're enough to ruin the movie, just imagine telling them to Stephen Lang in a dark room."
" Daddy of the Year
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,6,"""Don't Breathe"" is an American movie in the English language that is relatively short and stays under 90 minutes including credits. The writer and director is Fede Alvarez, who is probably Uruguay's most known filmmaker now with this film and the new ""Evil Dead"" in his body of work. Also he seems likely to work on the Lisbeth Salander film(s) in the future. But now let us take a look at this one here. Alvarez recast Jane Levy from ""Evil Dead"" and if you watch television shows, you may have seen her in ""Suburgatory"" as well. I personally like her quite a bit. She resembles recent Oscar winner Emma Stone a bit, physically and in terms of talent, even if she did not yet break through on the same level. So yeah I certainly like her, she is pretty stunning, even with bruised face makeup on her head and I also think she is pretty talented. Together with Stephen Lang from ""Avatar"", she carried this film nicely from start to finish. Levy is the only girl in a trio of semi-professional burglars who set out to rob people's houses. But when they decide to break into a former soldier's house, things don't go exactly as planned and even the fact that he is blind is not helping them at all as all his other senses are somewhat sharpened.As for Levi's two male supporting actors, they are fine I guess. A bit generic in the ways they were written, especially the kind guy with his daddy and his crush on Levi's character etc. not too inspired. The other one was fun basically and in his crassness pretty entertaining, even if you somewhat expected what would happen to him after he ejaculated in people's houses etc. His demise still came surprisingly quickly. You can structure this film nicely into 3 parts I guess. First would be the introduction to the characters, what they do and their big plan. Second would be the fight for survival inside the guy's house. And third would finally be the solution about Lang's character and why he does what he does and of course the ending. I personally think the second part is probably the weakest. I felt a bit lost there at times. Maybe this was Alvarez' intention too that we would feel like the protagonists who don't know the place and have no clue where they currently are or what to do, but this middle part did not work out as well as the other two I think. Then again, I also did not really like the ending with the loud alarm system to be honest, even if it makes sense somehow. But the insemination scene towards the end was pretty good and really scary, even if the kid of course has to come the very moment Lang's character wants to get her pregnant. Why has he lived for so long anyway while the tough kid dies so early? A bit strange.Oh yeah, Lang is really good here, strong physical performance. You will need subtitles if you don't speak English, but the movie is also really many times about silence and sounds rather than words, especially in the middle part. I personally liked the final shot as well when we see the two girls head away and even if the female protagonist almost paid for it with her life she committed the perfect crime somehow with what we see in the news at the very end. The biggest moral question arises with Lang's character of course. Sure he does and plans some despicable things in here, but is he really a victim or a perpetrator? He only hurts people who hurt him and cause him harm. And the horrors he's been through in war, the loss of his sight, the loss of his daughter and now maybe the loss of his fortune... If you see what he had to suffer through, is it so absurd that it drove him somewhat insane? And he does not want to kill the girl(s), just let them get away after nine months eventually. Anyway, I think this was a pretty good film. Alvarez did what he had to do in terms of plots (the subplot with the imprisoned girl) to get the film to the 1.5-hour mark and it's all working out pretty well I think. It did feel realistic in my opinion. Now I see there is already a sequel planned, apparently focusing on Lang's and not Levy's character which would somehow make sense and I will make sure I check that one out at some point because I give this first film plus Lang's and Levy's performances a major thumbs-up. A must see if you like psychological horror flicks."
" Hold your breath, then let out a sigh of despair
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,4,"When this was advertised for the cinema, it looked amazing. The trailers made the film look like the masterpiece horror of 2016, not to be missed at any cost. After all the amazing reviews I read for this, I just had to sit down and watch it. I love amazing horror movies, and this seemed like the one that was going to be the best for the last of 2016, and the start of 2017.This movie started off terribly slow. It didn't catch my attention at all, and I found my attention wandering and thinking about other horror movies I've been meaning to watch. Eventually, our main characters get to our veteran's house. There's still nothing to really drag you in at this point in time. It's not until about half an hour, forty minutes into the movie when you're really dragged in.We're thrown in straight away into a tense situation that makes the viewer shiver and get goosebumps. You end up rigid on the couch, trying not to make too much noise. You watch in fear as our main characters struggle through an almost Saw like situation, trying to break out of the veteran's house after breaking in. Then we have some weak fight scenes that again, made my mind wander, considering what movie to put on next.Spoilers in the next paragraphAfter this we have some very disturbing scenes in which he tries to artificially inseminate the female main character with things that are explained better within the movie than what I could do. I thought this would be a movie where disability =/= weakness, but it ended up with the disabled being totally psychotic and plain vile.Spoilers over.This movie doesn't end. It just continues on and on to the point where it's just overkill and no longer entertaining. The female character ends up becoming strong, finally, and it's welcome to see, but it was mostly a boring movie. I was glad when it was over, and I turned it off as quickly as I could. Give this film a miss; it was over hyped, treated it's disabled character terribly and also lacked decent characters. A definite failure of the horror genre."
" A good premise, which was well executed
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,8,"Three teenagers break into the house of an old blind man, which they believe will be a simple task. Turns out it's not when the old blind man is played by Stephen LangThe director is the same one who tried to remake ""Evil Dead"", which he did just OK-ly. In this film however Fede Alvarez, the director, did a fantastic job. He was the best part of the whole film. He used some very good camera movements and long takes, which created a slow feel at times, to create a tenser atmosphere. There's a very good scene when the three main protagonists first enter the house of the blind man. This was made to look like a long continuous take, in which the camera moves through the floor and through walls. In that sequence we also get to see some things that will be used further on in the film. They accentuate the things that later will be used pretty hard, but I didn't really mind because of the awesomeness of that scene alone. Fede Alvarez was really good at creating tension. He used slow editing, mixed with camera movements that went slow, or fast when needed. To build up tension, the editing was slow, and the camera movements to were slow. When there was a chase scene, it was the exact opposite. The amazing score accompanied with these scenes also helped with creating the tense atmosphere that they are going for. But the thing that might help the most is the basic premise of the film. The man having the disadvantage to the kids with being blind, and them breaking into his house, but more on that later. The cinematography was really good, this was one of the better looking horror films of recent years, some others conclude ""It Follows"" and I found ""Green Room"" to be shot very good as well. The acting was just OK overall. The main actress wasn't fantastic, but she did what she did what the film asked of her. Jane Levy played this character. The kid from ""Goosebumps"", Dylan Minnette (Alex in the film) was pretty good. At least better than his co-star Jane Levy. The third and final kid of the three that break in was played by Daniel Zovatto, who basically copied Jared Leto's performance from ""Panic Room"". Not only did he copy his performance, but also his looks (the hair/clothing style). ""Don't breathe"" copies that film in numerous aspects and it's quite obvious that it wants to pay homage to it, but at times they could've kept it more subtle. The scene which I previously talked about (the one continuous take), was also sort of copied from ""Panic Room"". The final actor I want to talk about is also basically the only actor who's there to talk about, who's also the star of the film, namely Stephen Lang, who played the blind man. He was fantastic. I loved his performance. He was menacing, yet made it in the beginning look like he was very innocent. The depth that he brought to his character was really good. And also note that he barely has any lines, so it was really amazing how he was able to express his emotions via little to no dialogue, which only makes the role harder.The screenplay was OK; the dialogue and premise were good, but the plot conveniences weren't really that good. These convenience or illogicalities really brought me out of the film at times. The inconsistency of the blind man's senses is an example of plot conveniences. He could smell shoes that were on the other side of the room, but wasn't able to smell someone, who's probably sweating due to stress, standing next to me. But also some things that happen mainly because of plot. Like the dog magically appearing in the house, yet all doors were locked. Or when Goosebumps kid falls through a window, yet they're all covered with bars The film contains a lot of these instances to which I disturbed myself, but these flaws aren't really groundbreaking. They are bad parts of the film and affect the grade that I'm giving this film, but overall worse things could've happened, and the good parts certainly outweigh the bad parts. Like the main premise for example. It was an original idea that hasn't really been done before, except for last year's ""Hush"", but I that film the one whose house gets broken into was deaf and not blind. This sets up an interesting story, which was also executed pretty well. And what I also liked from the film is that it plays with who you are rooting for. At first I wasn't rooting for the three leads at all, because, well, they're breaking into the house of a defenseless, old, blind man. Even when we learn that the man isn't as defenseless as he seemed in the beginning, I still rooted for him, but then at around 75 percent into the film, something happens whereby the rooting side changed, and I really liked that.In the end ""Don't Breathe"" was a well shot and directed film, with an interesting premise that was well executed. It does suffer a bit of plot conveniences, but these are outweighed by the better aspects of the film. That's why this one gets an 8.1/10."
" are people really not seeing the gaping hole in this garbage??
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,1,starts off fairly not terrible but once the would be burglars are inside it falls apart. The whole movie is governed by a decision they make.Which was just pathetic. There are nothing but windows behind them not to mention other parts of the house and they decide to escape by going into a basement which had been heavy padlocked. Come on writers!!! Why would you not break and jump through a window RIGHT BEHIND YOU!! NOBODY in there right mind or otherwise would have done that. An insult to my intelligence.
" Tacky Tropes Set to SlowMo
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,3,"When I heard this film was getting so much buzz in a year ripe with quality horror, I was more than excited. What a let down. This hacky horror is a collection of the tackiest horror tropes with unsatisfying jump scares and more slow motion than a Zach Snyder movie. What was an interesting concept to twist the genre totally falls flat and into a tired and cringey slap fest. The villain lacks dimension so much so, you wish he was just Jason Voorhees so you could actually enjoy it. There's no one to root for and it's completely unsatisfying. 2016/17 horror really killed it and this film just did not."
" If he's a blind doesn't necessarily means that he's a saint .
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,9,"I'd like to start this review with quotation which recap the movie's plot ""There's nothing a man cannot do once he accepts the fact that there's no god"" . The movie shows you the ingenuity of Fede Alvarez's work and how expert he is in this field .

" Don't Breathe is a brilliant scary home invasion film which thrills you and a twist which disgusts you/
",2017-03-23 00:00:00,7,"Don't Breathe (2017): Recently I have watched two home invasion films Hush (2016) and The Strangers (2007). Hush is thrilling at its best but doesn't scare us and The Strangers is one of the most scariest thrillers I had ever seen but has very slow start.Don't Breathe has both qualities of Hush and The Strangers i.e.. both scary and engaging from the start but a awful twist spoiled the feel a bit.Plot: Rocky (Jane Levy), a young woman wanting to start a better life for her and her sister, agrees to take part in the robbery of a house owned by a wealthy blind man (Stephen Lang) with her boyfriend Money (Daniel Zovatto) and their friend Alex (Dylan Minnette). But when the blind man turns out to be a more ruthless adversary than he seems, the group must find a way to escape his home before they become his newest victims.Plus Points:1)Screenplay and Direction: Don't Breathe doesn't delay and enters the setup within a few minutes.Once they enter the house the movie becomes a scary thrilling ride where even audience awaits the sudden appearance of The Blind Man from nowhere.There are lot of nail biting scenes when the intruders hide from The Blind Man and especially when he turns off the power,the scene becomes more tense. Almost every scene finds new and creative ways to make these characters fight for their lives, whether it be in the crawling in the dark, running for their lives, or simply placed into increasingly tighter and tighter spaces. There's practically a scene to capitalize on every type of phobia imaginable, and Don't Breathe is perfectly paced in its ability to deliver fantastic scares.2)Sound Design: Don't Breathe is a master class in tension, and while its script could have been written on the back of an envelope, its editing and use of sound design is a triumph for film theorists.BGM made the scene more tense and during jump scares the sound design is excellent.3)Cinematography: The Blind Man's house is a normal old rotten house but a top notch cinematography gave it a view of an inescapable maze. Particularly its use of long tracking shots to establish the geography of its single location. Painstaking effort went into the look of this movie, and it shows. There's just no denying that, even in a terrible looking location, Don't Breathe is a beautiful looking movie.4)Performances: Stephan Lang as The Blind Man has all the qualities for becoming a latest horror icon.He deserves the majority of the acting credit for his sadistic yet almost sympathetic portrayal of The Blind Man.Jane Levy's wide eyed pupils are an asset as it portrayed lot of emotions.Her fear,her desperation,her helplessness.Close Up shots of her face is brilliant.Minus Points:1)Twist: Don't Breathe could have been a flawless thriller if it would have continued the same flow but it has this awful twist which spoiled the feel of the movie.The twist is so out of sync and it is clear that director want to have a violent scene even it it is not necessary.SO,Don't Breathe is a brilliant scary home invasion film which thrills you and a twist which disgusts you/My rating 7.5/10"
" One of the most exciting horror films of the year!
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,10,I hell loved it! I like the way how they made first deaf movie (Hush) and then this blind movie in the same year. Imagine if you were in closed house with one very dangerous and strong blind man. The director Fede Alvarez did an amazing job for this movie and I'm looking forward to his next projects. I enjoyed every second of it and it had me like what's going to happen next lol.10/10.
" In the home of the blind, the blind is still the king!
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,4,"In many of the reviews, user-comments and movie blog discussions that I encountered recently, ""Don't Breathe"" is referred to as one of the most intense, horrifying and genuinely shocking horror/thrillers of the past 10-15 years Is it now? Is it really, or are we simply not seeing enough intense and genuinely shocking thrillers lately? Because, after all, ""Don't Breathe"" is only a very simplistic and derivative story with stereotypical lead characters, highly questionable plot twists and only a handful of semi-decent jump scenes that you can feel coming well in advance. There's a reasonably uncanny and grim atmosphere throughout, and Stephen Lang puts down a solid anti-hero performance, but aside from that ""Don't Breathe"" is a very routine and forgettable heist-gone-wrong thriller. Fede Alvarez did a fairly respectable job remaking the almighty horror classic ""The Evil Dead"", and apparently Sam Raimi thought so too, as he appears on the credits as executive producer for Alvarez' newest and very own film baby. Three amateur teen burglars from the lower Detroit (or was it Chicago?) social middle- class think they have stumbled on the opportunity of a lifetime. They will break into the home of a former Gulf War veteran who allegedly stores a large sum of money from when his only daughter got killed in a road accident. It's guaranteed to be a piece of cake, since the veteran is the sole remaining resident in a pauperized housing area and, moreover, he turns out to be as blind as a bat! Of course it quickly becomes abundantly clear that they made a big mistake, for starters because our veteran owns a vicious Rottweiler dog (that is not blind) and, secondly, he isn't just a helpless disabled person but a genuinely relentless psychopath. The three teen burglars are hopelessly clichéd and cardboard characters. The self-acclaimed leader is tough but typically ruthless and dumb, then there's the overly cautious nerd who only participates because he's got a crush on the leader's cute girlfriend. And, obviously, the girlfriend in question – Rocky – is basically a good person but she only turns to criminal facts because she desperately wants to offer her little sister a better life, far away from their alcoholic mother. Yawn! Thrillers/horror movies with blind protagonists that can seriously kick ass aren't exactly scarce, neither. Only recently, for example, there also was the sublime movie ""Late Phases"" in which another blind middle-aged war veteran single- handedly battles a bloodthirsty werewolf. That guy lost his dog at the beginning of the film, but still he was tougher and more narcissist and – most of all – he didn't do stuff that blind people can't possibly do! Somewhere halfway in the plot of ""Don't Breathe"", the burglars discover a dark and horrifying secret in the blind man's basement. This initially seems like an inventive and surprising plot twist, but not if contemplate about it a bit further. How on earth a blind person capable of arranging all this, I'd really like to know. ""Don't Breathe"" certainly isn't a bad film, but judging by the current rating and the numerous praising reviews, I can safely say it's one of the most overrated thrillers of the past years."
" Boring...
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,2,"I was really excited to see this movie even though I'd not heard any reviews on it. There were no ""jump scares"" nor any horror involved. This is probably a good movie for someone just starting out in the horror genre. I wish there was a bit more horror involved with the movie since it does have some potential."
" Blind Revenge
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,7,"This has been done before, with the protagonists being women instead of a man; Audrey Hepburn in ""wait Until Dark"" and Mia Farrow in ""See No Evil"" were blind victims avoiding bad people. ""Don't Breathe"" changes it to a military veteran who turns out to be the wrong person to attack. Two men and a woman rob houses using information obtained by a guy whose father runs a home alarm company and so he has the codes to disable the alarms. The trio hear of a large amount of cash in the blind mans house and they figure it should be easy pickings. Not so fast, boys and girl, this victim is one tough son of a bitch with a vicious Rottweiler to provide an extra layer of nastiness. The trio have several violent encounters with the sightless Rambo, and this leads to an extremely entertaining hour and a half. There are some plot holes but the actors are competent and ""Don't Breathe is an above average thriller."
" Tense, taut and thrilling terror.
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,7,"Sometimes crime will turn around knock you on your butt. Rocky (Jane levy) is a young woman that carries out robberies with her boyfriend Money (Daniel Zovatto) and younger mutual friend Alex (Dylan Minnette), in hopes of coming up with enough cash to leave Detroit and head to California. It seems they have found the perfect home to break into. The house belongs to a reclusive military veteran known only as the Blind Man (Stephen Lang). The trio know the man is holding a large amount of money; they don't realize the blind man is a savvy, ruthless psychopath. Not such an easy target! Much better than you think it is going to be. Dark, brutal and violent and well deserving of the R rating.Other players: Franciska Torocsik, Katia Bokor, Sergej Onopko and Emma Bercovici."
" The trailers were not what you get
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,8,"I have a very bad habit of going into movies with a cynical attitude and I didn't break that habit here. However, this movie managed to really shock and surprise me when it came to its presentation. Well designed sets and cliché, but truly horrifying horror movie gimmicks make this movie feel like a renaissance of classic 90's horror. With a villain who can be sympathized with and heroes who often cannot, this movie really manages to push the boundaries of what we find comfortable. I can honestly say that this movie alone makes up for the crude market of horror/thriller movies we've seen in the past few years. Do yourself a favor and see it before it's spoiled for you."
" A plot-hole fest yet entertaining
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,6,"There is no way for me to give the movie a lower rating than 6. The acting and directing definitely make it a decently entertaining experience. That is if you're willing to switch of your brain for the duration of the movie.I really don't mind a film in which none of the protagonists is really likable. Usually actually quite enjoy that style of storytelling, but edgy characters just don't help if too much stuff just doesn't add up.I am not going to recap or summarize the movie. IMDb and many other reviews did that before.Either you are still interested in watching the movie and then, again, as long as you're just up for some suspense without much thought, by all means go for it. You won't feel like you lost 90min of your life.But be aware, it is a true plot-hole fest. If you mind that this is not for you.Here is were I give my SPOILER WARNING! What follows are all the plot holes I could spot, so don't continue reading if you want to discover them yourself!1. Why is it presumed he will keep his reconciliation money in cash at home?2. While entering the home the three kids cause the dog to bark, rattle locks, smash glass... Our blind friend remains in slumber land, no problem.3. Somehow the blind guy is immune to gas.4. Once awake the blind vet's perception abilities are definitely heightened but quite selectively so. He can hear them breath. He hears a faint creaking of the floor. He smells their shoes from a two meter distance. Yet he is unable to smell them or feel their body heat when they are passing him bleeding and sweating in not even an arms length distance.5. Why does he have an alarm system linked to the police when he has a kidnapped impregnated girl down in his basement?6. This one is not a plot-hole but rather an uncalled for moral lesson by the writer. When the girl is about to take the place of the priorly kidnapped girl and starts praying he tells her 'there is no god, once a man realizes that he can do anything'. Yeah, right. Cause faith totally kept those kids from breaking into a blind man's home and also in general keeps people from say... raping kids, beheading people... While people without faith can't possibly have morality. F off.7. Anyway, next plot-hole. When trying to impregnate here he cuts her jeans with huge scissors. We know he's successful cause he is about to proceed with inseminating her. However once her friend comes to the rescue her jeans miraculously recover completely which we can see perfectly in the ass shot during the dog-car scene. Man, I want a pair of those self repairing jeans.8. Also, to keep sperm in a fridge is not that simple and you surely cannot warm it up on a gas stove. Destroys the protein. Renders the sperm useless. Complete BS.9. I also really would like to know how the police just shrugged off his obvious sex kink kidnapping corner and home made sperm bank inside his basement. As well as the insane amounts of blood everywhere at least one DNA of which doesn't match with any of the dead burglars...10. Also interesting when the girl who killed his daughter vanished the police seemingly didn't look into him at all.So yeah, it just didn't add up at quite too many spots. Not blown away. Still the acting and directing were not bad, so it wasn't a complete waste of time."
" Awful
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,1,"This movie is amazing in that it got made in the first place. Numerous people must have read the script and still made decisions allowing the process to move forward. Ultimately, though, audiences are just as stupid as the scripting suggests they are since this movie was apparently quite profitable. I have literally had bowel movements that had more forethought and consideration behind them than this garbage."
" Not What You'd Expect at All
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,10,"Three young people break into the house of a man who received a huge settlement in an automobile accident case. During the robbery, they discover he's blind...but that doesn't keep him from being a formidable foe...and something else no one is aware of.The twists come soon enough as they discover the ex-soldier hasn't let a little thing like blindness make him helpless but the big shocker is what is discovered in his basement...and enough said about that without this becoming a spoiler. The new development could've been a movie of its own.This is a tense film with some good acting bits though most of it is performed in near-darkness and not so much dialogue. This one is chilling, scary, shocking, and disquieting because it's really two stories in one."
" What's brown and sounds like a bell?
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,1,"Dung. Just to clarify, this movie is also brown and sounds like a bell. Before you fall for the reviews and dive nose-first into it, please try to understand a few things...This is a film (a thriller film, apparently) that aims to portray the perpetrators of home invasions as God-fearing victims with pure motives, war veterans as insane, murderous rapists that hunt by scent and echolocation, and old blind men as reclusive, unhygienic, and insane.The plot is pretty simple. Three degenerate young adults (well, two degenerate young adults and a rich boy; an aspiring degenerate young adult, I suppose) are having a good old time burgling people's houses to raise money to move to California. Right off the bat, it becomes impossible for a rational, thinking individual to sympathize, in any way, with these people. They are initially shown to not only be robbing a house but, also, vandalizing said house, with one of them either urinating or ejaculating on the kitchen floor. Hey! It's OK, though! The girl (Rocky) is shown to come from a broken home shortly after, so she is completely justified in everything she does, right? I suppose all of the rest of us who got the shaft in life and did something productive with ourselves took the easy way out, right? Anyway, their fence informs them that they should consider actually stealing money if they want to make more money than they would make fencing stolen goods. Wow. Who would have thought? Seriously, who would have thought?! So, they break into an ""Army vet's"" house because they get a tip that he was compensated years earlier for the death of his daughter by the family of the daft teenage girl that was apparently being daft like a daft teenage girl is daft when she hit the poor guy's daughter with her car and killed her.As it turns out, the old guy is blind and, oddly enough, not very fond of having people break into his house. He proceeds to play a game of cat and mouse with the invaders, picking them off one by one, and then... I'm not even going to bother with how ridiculous it gets with the plot twist. I guess you'll just have see for yourself if you're intent on wasting your time.Jumping to the end, the girl ends up getting away with something like 1 million dollars from the old guy's house; the same one that was begging God for help at one point; the same one who left the bodies of her partners to rot; the same one that did nothing for the girl in the basement (like I said, you'll have to see for yourself); this girl makes it to California to live it up with her daughter/little sister/who cares with absolutely no consequences.Morale of the story? If you're a pretty female, it doesn't matter if you drove a man insane by carelessly slaughtering one of his family members with your car, it doesn't matter if you are selfishly robbing houses to sate your greed and avoid working to make a living. The fact is, you are always the victim, all the time, no matter what. Thanks for the insight, Hollywood. I've already finished writing it down on this piece of paper, and... **FLUSH**"
" No one to root for
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,5,"The concept of the villain was excellent and the premise made for great potential, but it really missed the mark. There are some legitimately intense moments, but those are few and far between. There were a lot of inconsistencies with what Stephen Lang's character could do and what the kids got away with at times. I didn't really root for anyone due to the lack of character depth. There aren't any 'good guys' in the film so it had me not really caring who came out on top. And it had the absolutely grossest movie moment of 2016 for me, maybe the 2000's in general. It was completely unnecessary and off-putting. Overall this was a disappointing offering, given what could have been done with the story."
" Be Careful Who You Steal From!
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,6,"This 2016 thriller stars Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, Daniel Zovatto and Stephen Lang. Levy (Evil Dead) plays Rocky, a young woman who has a bad home-life and wants to get away with her friends, Alex (Minnette) and Money (Zovatto). They spend most of their time together robbing various houses to get extra cash. Lang (Manhunter, Avatar) plays a blind, army veteran whom they mistakenly try to steal from next and learn he's not as incapable as they think. This is a pretty good film featuring a decent cast and plenty of suspenseful/tense moments. It also has aspects of ""Panic Room"" & ""The Silence of the Lambs"" thrown in and I recommend it."
" Don't hold your breath - this is not a good horror film
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,3,"This film, I had expectations. Especially on the basis of descriptions. I'm constantly searching for good horror movies, but they are sparse. There are few new ones that can measure up to the good old classics, such as The Shining. But here's mention good. It has high scores, and much praise. I gave Do not Breathe a chance tonight. And was very disappointed. There are three reasons for that. 1) The story is little original. We have seen this before. The characters have no personality or attractiveness to us who see the movie. We get no sympathy for them. 2) The action is so predictable that it almost is not to persevere. 3) An amazing little catchy ending. But it opens well for a sequel maybe? Let us hope that after this crash, comes the silence. The best thing I can write is that it is not very long and that there is a lot along the way. But do not expect to jump in his chair with fright. The film will surprise very little."
" The standout horror movie of the year
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,8,"A relentlessly brutal, frill-free horror, it pits three reckless teens against a battle-hardened enemy who takes no prisoners and who keeps them on the run within the confines of a run-down house where every floor board can give them away. Turning stories of blind victims as well as of similar home invasions on their head, the film catches you by surprise as it builds its own central premise: of robbers desperate to get out.Speaking of the premise, I advise you to watch this movie cold. The less you know about it the better. In fact, if you're overly finicky about even the slightest spoilers, wait till you've seen the movie before reading on. Not that there are going to be spoilers, but sometimes, simply knowing that there is going to be a twist is distracting enough.The mark (a menacing Stephen Lang), it is revealed, is an unstoppable force of nature.This isn't just any old home invasion thriller, even though it owes a great debt to classics like The Last House on the Left, Straw Dogs or Panic Room. It takes the conventions of the genre and doesn't so much flip them on their head as it shoots them in the face. Point blank. It understands the limitations of the genre and works wonders within them.While the film manages to smartly get back on its feet, it is clear Alvarez got greedy and extended Don't Breathe past its ideal running time. The thing is — and here is what makes Don't Breathe the standout horror of this year — you may be holding your breath till the last."
" Love it! The best horror film of 2016 - A classic!!
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,10,"This is certainly one fantastic thriller, a very original home invasion movie that's very tense and lots of fun and gripping throughout its running time, this movie is described in some reviews as a horror film but its really not, its horrific maybe as a thriller but not a straight up horror, there's no supernatural elements here. The movie is also described as having the best twist in years but that's overhyping just a tad I think as there is not so much a twist that makes you say wow I didn't see that coming its just a twisted story, none the less its a very well directed movie, very nice looking sets and locations, very well acted by a great cast and a tense soundtrack, if you like scares and jumps and nail-biting movies this is certainly for you, its not blood and guts. A must see thriller that's very well made and wont be forgotten for a while."
" Has one of the all-time great horror movie scenes
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,8,"It's rare for a movie to have me on the edge of my seat, genuinely curious as to what will happen next. In a genre where clichés are now the running gag, to make a film that is full of original ideas and creativity is a relief to say the least. I had heard a lot about ""Don't Breathe"" mainly through word of mouth, so I decided to finally see it without having so much as read a brief synopsis. I was skeptical about how a movie like this could sustain itself for a feature runtime. I was pleasantly surprised by how effective it is.The movie borrows major ideas and elements from some of cinema's best thrillers, and I mostly recalled ""Panic Room"" and ""Wait Until Dark"" as antithesis versions. The plot is almost laughably simple: 3 small-time burglars are hoping to strike it big when they hear a retired war veteran has won a settlement over the death of his daughter for upwards of $300 million. They assume the cash might be in his house, and even better is that they realize he has gone blind. These are barely kids in their 20's. Alex (the logical one of the group) uses his dad's spare keys from his security companies to disarm these homes, quietly loot various goods, and rearm the home and stage a fake robbery. Money, the wild one, is head-to-toe tattoos and carries a gun even though this could lead to a longer jail sentence should they be caught. Rocky, the heroine, sees the money as an opportunity to relocate her and her daughter to a better life. The plan is so simple.The director, Fede Alvarez, is known for making ""Evil Dead"" in 2003, but this is a clear exercise in tone and suspense. With each new moment, he adds a new layer to the dread, and the camera floats through the house to remind us where spare guns are hiding, which windows have bars... It's a technique that someone like Alfred Hitchcock might appreciate: showing the audience more than the characters know. When they first enter the man's home, there is a steady shot of a hammer hanging on a rack of tools. Nothing becomes of it, but our minds begin racing with ideas of how this will come into play or what it might be used for. Later, we see a spare gun strapped to the underside of a bed. Only the audience knows what dangers are in store.I won't spoil too much more of the film, only to say that the robbers' tour of the home lead to nearly every room of the home and some in between. A dark discovery in the basement finds them trapped with the blind man amongst rows and rows of shelving units, and as casually as he begins hunting them, he turns the fuse box over and leaves them in utter darkness. This scene (about midway through the film) harkened back to the chilling climax of ""Silence of the Lambs"" and yet raises the stakes tenfold from what Clarice Starling encountered with Buffalo Bill. We know his basement can only be so big, and we see the man wandering through the darkness touching familiar landmarks to remind himself the path he needs to take. Both Alex and Rocky are blind, shaking, barely moving forward. The scene is photographed in a smoky black & white, and the quiet breathes of the victims move in and out of earshot. Rocky moves down a hall, at the end of which slowly materializes the blind man, quietly waiting.. Listening. It's without a doubt one of the most effective horror scenes I have ever seen and the crowning achievement of the film.The film finally sees it's own form of climax, and for me this is where it began to drag. From the old man's dog (a vicious Rottweiler with an apparent taste for human flesh) to chases back and forth inside and outside the home, I have to admit the finale of the movie became an exhausting chore to keep up with. There were many moments when it felt like the story was coming to an end, and the 'shocking' moments were realizing that it was still going. This movie requires a great suspension of disbelief in order to enjoy (the logics of this movie have to be taken with a grain of salt or I would guess one's appreciation might be somewhat lessened), and with each new ""twist"" I felt the movie losing it's claustrophobic feel and moving more towards a standard slasher flick with it's own set of rules and horror clichés.Regardless, I will honestly admit this was a very fun film to experience in a theater. The photography is closed in and haunting, and the performance by Stephen Lang as the blind man is sure to become a classic in the vaults of iconic horror villains. For a movie with such a simple idea as a robbery gone wrong, boy did they get it so right. I only wish they would have pushed it further instead of drifting back to the standards a typical Hollywood revenge flick might take."
" Boring, tasteless and annoying
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,1,"This movie shouldn't have a 7.2 rating, is a 3 at most. Three minutes after beginning you hate every character, but it tries too hard to force you to hate them. I'm not given a reason to root for the thieves, and none to care for the blind man, and after 50 minutes of clichés I just wanted them to kill them, because they deserved it, but it's not gory enough to enjoy. Then they discover the girl in the basement and sort of ""justifies"" their actions. Predictable, awful, boring, plain, abject failure that makes one immediately regret having watched this movie. It's not a matter of taste, when you put two bad guys against each other and kind of condone the actions of either one you end up with the mess this movie is: Not thriller, not drama, no horror, no discernible genres, no dialog, no plot. So many horror movies end up being involuntary comedies, this one is just on the angry side of ""meh"", the angry part being the girl keeping the money. Directly before this movie I watched Lights Out, and it felt like eating a $200 steak and after that a $2 textured soy."
" This movie was great!!!
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,9,"I loved this movie! It is full of suspense and thrills! Every character could be categorized as a 'baddie', which means when the carnage begins there is no reason to feel sorry for anyone! This film was made for about $10 million according to the web. It was a simple plot designed to give the audience some good scares and thrills. IT DELIVERED! I must say if you demand an Alfred Hitchcock or Steven Spielberg type experience out of every movie you see, then you should really get some perspective on reality! I am fed up with all the negative reviews from the haters! Why is the internet culture a culture of negativity and ridicule? The film, Don't Breathe, is a fun experience with every bit of suspense and tension that a movie of this genre can be expected to deliver. The reviewers who analyzed this movie down to the finest details act like they are so divine and insightful with their criticisms. I would highly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a simple thriller for a fun time. Go watch Meryl Streep if you want a Best Picture nomination experience! BOO HATERS."
" Much Better Than I Expected
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,8,"One of the best suspense/thriller movies from 2016, ""Don't Breathe"" has three teens (Jane Levy playing the main character of the bunch) breaking into the home of a blind man (played by Stephen Lang) to steal a lot of cash that he supposedly has in the house.It's supposed to be an easy job for the teen burglars: Lang lives alone in a Detroit neighborhood where almost every house is abandoned (few witnesses); one of the teens has a master key for the burglar alarm that Lang uses; Lang is old, the teens are young and they outnumber him. But once inside Lang's home, the young thieves get much more than they planned for when Lang proves to be a very tough and vicious opponent who also harbors some very dark, nasty secrets.My most memorable, movie moment is the scene when the burglars discover a hidden room in Lang's basement that reveals a shocking secret.""Don't Breathe"" has a few, minor shenanigans that most viewers will easily forgive because overall, the entire movie works very well. It is very suspenseful, the pacing is fast, the acting is good, you'll want to know what happens to each of the four characters, and there are a few surprises thrown in there that seasoned movie fans should be able to foresee.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
" Ruined by the last 30 seconds!
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,4,"I could go with this horror/suspense all through the close shaves, luck etc. I liked the premise, acting was fair. But like many low budget thrillers is it riddled with plot holes.Why was he not gassed? Why was his sense of smell sometimes like a sniffer dog but then could walk right past one of them? Could you navigate a unknown basement in pitch black as well as they did? Why was Rocky not gagged like the girl? If no one could hear screams locally, why was the original girl gagged!! Oh yes....because then the intruders could hear her...sorry, poor thinking that.But the biscuit was well and truly taken by the last sequence. I was quite satisfied for Rocky to head into the sunset with her sister and cash, but what on earth convinced them to do the TV report! Are you telling me in the 10 seconds the police took to exit their car and enter the house the blind man was able to get up from being bashed to near death, hide ALL the evidence in the basement (maybe he could pass it off a a fetish room!) and the entire crime scene which spanned about 6 rooms.Pathetic and unnecessary. The plot needed polishing up big time. Then this could have been a armrest gripping thriller imho.It had a 6 until the airport (I'm quite tough) but lost 2 marks just for that idiotic ending."
" Horror has a new name with 'Don't Breathe'.
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Fede Alvarez burst onto the scene a few years ago with his short film on YouTube called 'Ataque de Pánico!' It was so well received and well done that a few weeks later, Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, and Rob Tapert were calling him non-stop and even offered the Uruguayan filmmaker the chance to direct the remake of 'The Evil Dead', which came out 2013 to rave reviews and fan appreciation for what it was. Since then, Fede has a few projects in the works coming up, as he is one of the top new filmmakers to watch in the horror genre.His newest film, 'Don't Breathe' is almost the complete opposite of 'his remake of the 'Evil Dead', in that it is shows almost zero gore and blood and relies on a high amount of suspense and tension throughout the film, which is indeed very successful. I was definitely fidgeting with my fingers and on the edge of my seat the entire time, as the movie goes through dark halls and corners both visually and metaphorically with some sinister twists and turns throughout. The added suspense comes with making the unnamed old man in the film blind, as three young adults plan to rob him, not really knowing who or what he is.Even the multiple locks on the doors and bars on the windows in his run-down Detroit home are not enough clues to these kids that maybe this house is not a good idea. The young adults Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette, and Daniel Zovatto are on a house robbing spree, in order to make enough money to get out of Detroit. It's a half-baked notion and story, but it gets us into the house owned by a blind man (Stephen Lang) with a past. The problem here is that each character and most of the dialogue just doesn't make any sense and comes across as silly to where you just roll your eyes. It takes you out of the whole suspense here and there during the film.The reasons why these kids rob houses isn't entirely clear and they don't come across as being in anyway redeeming, compared with the crimes they commit. The dialogue is also borderline cringe worthy, and when Stephen Lang finally talks, he sounds a lot like Batman's nemesis Bane, which caused laughter, rather than horror. That all being said, Fede Alvarez is a master of his camera and shooting a movie. From the steadicam one shot that moves multiple levels through the house as the robbers case the place to the slow and intensifying shots in the more suspenseful moments all work very well. The camera purposefully lets you know what props and other devices will come into play later in the film, which already gets your mind going.Alvarez also uses a different version of night vision here when the lights go out in the basement of his home, which is utterly terrifying, and I hope that gets used in future films. Jane Levy is an excellent actress and coming from her starring role in 'Evil Dead', she has more or less to work with here, but she gives it her all and is the one character who actually has some sort of backstory. The other two actors, who again are good, just have no where to go here, thus not connecting or really care what happens to them.And of course there is Stephen Lang, who besides his accent in the film, is one of the scariest characters of recent memory, who takes some dark turns throughout, but also has his own reasoning, which is in away – sympathetic. Oh yeah, and he's blind. The score by Roque Baños has a John Carpenter aspect to it at times and always adds to the high tension throughout. I just wish the story and the bulk of the characters weren't as silly as they came across here. Still, this is a solid and effective effort from Fede Alvarez.WORTH A LOOK!"
" Good drama
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,8,"This is actually a pretty good movie. I recommend it if you're looking for something to watch. The basic plot is this: millennials break into a old blind guy's house to rob him, but end up fighting for their lives.This film has an unusual twist to it: the protagonists are the bad guys. Throughout the movie we are challenged with good and bad aspects of the two sides. There is some interesting moral ambiguity here. Who are we rooting for exactly? On the one hand, we have attractive millennials, possessing youth and sight, but living amorally and narcissistically. On the other hand, we have a blind old man who has lived a life of discipline and service, and is still a force to be reckoned with despite his age and blindness; however, he is creepy as hell, vengeful, and capable of using violence to defend himself. And he has a very mean dog.I'm not sure everyone would enjoy this kind of moral ambiguity.The most important character in this movie is the house. This is where the characters fight each other for their lives. Much of the tension of the movie comes from the fact that he knows his house, and the intruders don't.The film is worth about 7.5, but I'm going to round it up because it was just entertaining."
" Poor
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,1,"This film was bad in so many ways . So many plot holes and too many easy coincidences . How difficult would it be to evade a blind man even in his own home . So what if the guy was a veteran , it doesn't excuse the fact that the guy is a rapist and a murderer. A blind guy with a gun is not much of a threat no matter how good a shot he is .Why Money just didn't shoot him in the leg and tie him up to start with is beyond me . Bad film , bad idea , sloppy writing . Please don't give them money to make a sequel . I like most of the actors involved but the material is too generic and unoriginal for most modern tastes . If anybody sympathises with the character that Stephen Lang played , then I worry about the film going public in general"
" for who said ""they are so stupid for do not attack from first""
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,8,"why everybody look so scary right now,,, all saying : why the girl and innocent boy don't kill the army from first meeting or a soon as possible,,?? i think they who said that don't see the prologue: They are just newbie bastard who just steal little stuff from empty house,, they never plan to kill somebody,, they are just to scary to kill.so something unpredictive thing happens and how are they will reacts?? how will they think to kill the army,, when the girl n little boy not bring anything and too scary to anything. this is so natural i think,, not every body have reaction/brave to kill somebody, dude. so you expect the little boy who just son of security and the girl who daughter of bitch can easily kill somebody. Or you too many watch RAMBO stuff -sorry for my bad English-"
" Shut In
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,6,"Unemployed and unable to find legitimate work, three young adults take to thievery as a last resort, however, breaking in a blind Vietnam War veteran's house leads to some horrific twists in this home invasion thriller produced by Sam Raimi. From the premise alone, the film sounds a lot like the earlier Adam Schindler movie 'Intruders' (aka 'Shut In') with the notion of the person whose home is being invaded being less helpless than first appears. Along these lines, 'Don't Breathe' seems to up the ante by making the thieves sympathetic; Jane Levy's character in particular has extensive early scenes in which we come to understand how much she and her younger sister not only want but need to move away from home. This dynamic renders the first half of 'Don't Breathe' quite interesting as we are pulled between feeling sorry for the blind war veteran and for the thieves with various incidents causing our sympathies to swing back and forth. The film disappointingly chooses a side around halfway in though as it is revealed that the veteran has a shocking secret in his basement. Not only is the secret implausible, it places us in an awkward position where ethically we have to root for the thieves instead, which just does not sit right. The film certainly has enough in the thrills and chills department that it is entertaining until the end and the pacing is never off. There is also a lot to like in the idea of the war veteran being better equipped than the thieves even without his sight, even if this idea could have perhaps been put to better use."
" A good movie that has big mistakes
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,6,"The film is fine, keeps you stuck and keeps the tension all the time. It has very good moments and interesting turns.It also has times when it seems like either there was no budget or they did not know how to do it. I'll comment on spoiler zone.There are also times when it is predictable, but it is accomplished and you believe it and forgive it.He deceives us at some point using the night camera, so let's see, because it suits him well, but I should have used photography in a different way. However the picture is pretty good, if it was not because I do not understand how that man has lights on at home.It has an address that in some moments makes very interesting plans. It tells us and makes us go through fear showing everything and composing the plan. Takes the tension very well and keeps the excitement all the time. It overrides how predictable it is.A film that fulfills its mission.Spoiler:What I do not like is how the time has come to save the girl who is going to be inseminated. I do not see anything, it does not fit the camera well. Also, since when the sperm is kept alive as maintained by the live?I also do not like how he tricks us when he nails the kid the pruning shears and it turns out that they have been nailed to another."
" Stephen Lang is perfect, the movie very suspenseful.
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,7,"Three burglars find out about a blind army vet, living in an abandoned street, sitting on a huge amount of cash. The three burglars break their rule of not stealing cash and decide to rob the place, thinking it would be a piece of cake. And of course it isn't. The blind army vet isn't as helpless as they had hoped for.Don't Breathe is directed by Fede Alvarez, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Rodo Sayagues. They obviously felt inspired by David Fincher's Panic Room (2002), and did come up with a great, suspenseful movie. The three burglars are played by Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto, who all do a great job. Stephen Lang however outshines everyone in this movie as the old blind man. He doesn't say a lot but his gestures and mimics were enough to be uncomfortably creepy. Even though he played a blind guy, he still made his character seem anything but helpless, on the contrary, his character was more menacing than any ghost, monster or murderer from your average horror movie. On the other hand however, you feel sorry for the blind man. He's simply a man trying to protect his house from burglars. Or is there more behind this man? The movie does a good job making you wonder about whether the blind man has something to hide or not. The movie does a poorer job however with Daniel Zovatto's character, he's the typical character every horror movie has: the asshole that talks too much and doesn't care about anything or anyone.Besides one or two cheap jump scares, the movie succeeded at maintaining a lingering suspense throughout the entire movie. Once the three burglars are inside the house, there won't be a moment that you'll feel at ease. This is an edge-of-your-seat kind of movie. The movie opens with a scene that obviously takes place later in the movie, which alerts you that until that scene, the burglars will never be safe, and heightens the suspense even more.As the movie progresses, the twists and turns in the story start to accumulate. Twists and turns in a story are great but not if there are too many, and not if these twist and turns are the ones you might expect from a horror movie. Throughout its course, the movie becomes more and more predictable. And this is where the suspense, although still being present, lessens. 'Don't Breathe' is a great horror movie, accessible for people who don't usually enjoy the genre. It has a great premise and is very suspenseful but becomes a bit too predictable over time."
" It was fantastic, minus... One part.
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,9,"This is EASILY one of the best horror films I have ever seen! (And I've seen a good many in my day (though I'm only about 20 years old)) Everything about it just went fantastically. Everyone knew what they were doing, the actors, the cameramen, the editing, it was stupendous!However, there is only one part in here that just didn't seem to fit. Almost as if they put it in there just to extend the time. I won't say what it is, it just sticks out like a sore thumb to me. But regardless, everything else about the movie was exceptional. There were no fake jumpscares in the movie and even when there was, it actually meant something when it happened. Don't Breathe in itself is legitimately scary and I am definitely buying this movie on Blu Ray when I get enough money for it."
" Listen to what you can not see
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,7,"It's been a while now since I watched a horror movie where you can feel the tension throughout almost the entire movie. Don't Breathe is definitely one of them. A well made modern horror/thriller movie about three young people trying to make some money by burglarizing. Jane Levy, Dylan Minnette and Daniel Zovatto did a good job playing the three criminals. When they think they're going to do a last big hit they encounter an at first sight easy job because the occupant is a blind old man. What follows next is a roller-coaster of suspense with a couple of good twists. Stephen Lang as the blind man gave a good performance, especially when he was using his ears to detect danger. An enjoyable thriller that I will watch again in the future."
" Really makes you stop breathing!
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,8,"It's really a great thriller that, true to the title, makes you hold your breath, sometimes too long, without you realizing it.I gave it an eight because the writing could be better. They don't give enough reason for the audience to root for these guys. I mean, you try to rob a blind war veteran. Who's going to root for you? And Rocky is the only one with a background story, and not a very good one either. The others have zero background story. They could at least give Alex a little story and give Rocky a stronger one, so we would understand that she/they really need to do this.However, once you get into the thriller part, this director really gives you no room to breathe. It really is one scary $#i+ after another without much break. And Stephen Lang really is one hell of a scary guy. I mean, I'm certain if I meet him off the camera, I'd be afraid he's going to stab me with a huge Army knife or something. The three kids are no slouch either in the acting department. It's like they're $#i++ing in their pants out of fear for real.Really, if you want a good scary movie, this is it. This director is good and Sam Raimi is behind the production. With a little bit of a better writing, I'd give this a perfect ten."
" A first-rate suspense, good cast and a great tone.
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Do not Breathe surprised me, I always thought it would be a movie in the middle, did not expect it would be great, is a movie to watch in silence, since it is a movie that has a very somber tone, has tense moments, a good Cast, and good performances, highlight Stephen Lang who is great, the script is good, but I thought the film had a very weak end, and also did not like the revelation about the blind character, I liked the direction of Alvarez that is A very promising director, without doubt one of the best film of the year, and perhaps the best suspense / horror movie, I recommend too much, not so many scares, but remember that it is a suspense thriller. Note 8.7"
" one of my favourite horror films and one of 2016's best!!
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"A teenage girl Rocky decides to rob a blind man's house to live with her little sister somewhere safe from her abusive,alcoholic parents. She goes with her two friends to rob a blind mans house but do they know who he really is and what he's hiding. I only finished watching Don't Breathe right now on TV as I bought it on Sky Store. The film was absolutely amazingly mind blowingly fantastic. From actors with only a bit of experience,this film is now one of my favourite 2016 films and favourite horror films. The film was so creepy and deranged especially what the blind man was going to do to the teenage girl,it was very messed up. A sequel has been announced so I'm really excited to see that. But,Don't breathe is a film your not going to want to miss. If you love horror films like I do,you will love this guaranteed!!!!"
" OK but not riveting
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,7,"This is an okay movie. Some have commented that it contains plot holes, but what horror movie doesn't? Indulge them a little and you'll enjoy the movie a lot. Also some have commented on its moral message. Really? Has it come to this that even an escapist horror movie has to have a message? Does everything have to these days? Give me a movie full of despicable characters and moral degenerates that is entertaining anytime. I mean who is so desperate that they have to turn to movies to evince their moral message. Are we that desperate and our societies so fragile that moral messages need to evident in every single piece of information? And what the exploitation of the disabled... the blind man? And the elderly as well?. What really incensed me though is that they never mentioned the real cause of it all ...global warming."
" Great home invasion thriller...
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,8,"Really not sure where to begin with this film I mean it really exceeded my expectations I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did this is definitely a great home invasion thriller Fede Alvarez definitely did do a good job I wasn't really expecting his second feature film to be something like this that's what made it more surprising for me. This movie basically centers on 3 thieves Rocky,Money and Alex who break into the house of a sick old man who's a war veteran that had lost his only daughter because they're told he has money hidden in there but they didn't expect him to wake up and start defending himself I say that loosely because he kills 2 of them Money and Alex shoots both of them...Money is in the beginning when they first break in and find the closet where he keeps the safe which is locked and as I said the man wakes up because he heard how the lock was blown off that was most likely the reason and he catches Money out because he steps on it then ends up shooting him in front of Rocky that was a pretty messed up scene Alex is killed later. Later in the film as well when Rocky and Alex are trying to escape they found a woman in the house handcuffed and tied up that was the woman that killed the man's daughter he was keeping her there because she was pregnant with his baby he promised her he'd let her go as soon as she gave him a new child which is why he was so upset when he'd realized that she had gotten shot by a bullet from his gun. I don't really want to spoil much more but if you haven't seen this movie I'd definitely recommend it it's now one of my favorites."
