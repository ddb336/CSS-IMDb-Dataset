" A pleasant surprise.
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,9,"This was one of the films I saw at the last New Year's Eve, and it was a pleasant surprise, considering that I was not particularly impressed with the synopsis I had read about it. The strong point of the film is the simple fact that it is based, obviously in a very distorted way, on a meeting that really took place between Elvis Presley, one of the most notable music artists ever, and the American President Richard Nixon, remembered by American history for the worst reasons, usually, given that he was one of the few presidents to step down to avoid being forced out from office.The script is good, and adapts perfectly to a short film like this. In fact, almost everything happens only during one day of the singer's life, who, distressed by drug abuse by young people, decides to collaborate with the authorities as a plain clothed federal agent, secretly, in order to combat the abuses of youth who, for him, corrupted America. Nixon is not a kind of man who adheres to fashions or wants to be with singers, and will naturally pose several objections to the meeting, but he will be overcome by his daughter, who is an Elvis fan.The cast is as small as the film, but it has a great performance by Kevin Spacey, an actor that I usually don't usually appreciate very much but who did an excellent job as the president. Michael Shannon is an actor I didn't know, I don't remember any of his films, but I think he did an interesting job in the role of Elvis, although I have my doubts about how strict he was in the way he portrayed the King. Obviously, the scenes with the White House advisers stank of comic satire and I don't believe they happened that way. Alex Pettyfer, Colin Hanks and Evan Peters play the secondary roles with dignity and commitment, the latter two with a strong comic streak.Technically, it is a pleasant film, which entertains and flows smoothly until the end, with good doses of humor and very inspired and colorful dialogues. It has a pleasant cinematography and the costumes make good use of the clothes and fashion of that time. The sets, in turn, are not so visibly dated, but they fit perfectly. The soundtrack is very good and uses iconic songs like ""Hold On, I'm Comming"" by Sam and Dave, or ""Suzy Q"", by Creedence Clearwater Revival, functioning as a true potpourri of the best music of the early Seventies."
" Nice, not more not less
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,7,"Good Ol Hitchcock once said, that a very good initial idea makes it difficult to build up a better story (or something like that). Thinking of those two characters meeting is in itself mindprovoking and the story doesn't deliver much more. I'd prefer Nixon Frost for a deeper chracterisation of the two persons involved, but this movie can bring you oz through the afternoon if you are interested in the topic. Btw, Spacey is great as an actor."
" I prefer Elvis Meets Nixon from 1997
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,4,"Michael Shannon was the wrong actor to play Elvis. They should have got Rick Peters, from the Elvis meets Nixon movie from 1997, he was excellent as Elvis. Spacy as Nixon was good but they could have brought out more of his character. They could, and should, have done a lot more with this movie."
" Spacey would play nixon. Both creeps
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,1,Turned it off once I saw spacey. #saveourchildren. ...
" A T.V. Movie nothing more
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,6,"The casting was so off the actor who played Elvis dos not like him at all , and even Kevin Spacy was not at his usual ,, do not get too exited about it"
" Pathetic
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,1,What a waste of time. I wonder if Michael Shannon can play or impersonate Elvis Presley? Answer: NO HE CAN'T. Spacey acts like (add any politically incorrect word here). The story is available everywhere and I would advise those pursuits. The only redeeming factor of this movie is the soundtrack.
" Movies like this are why I write reviews.
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,10,"I don't usually write reviews for average movies. Usually I just write a review if it's a home run or if it's really bad, mainly to let the studios know someone liked or hated it. I want them to know I loved this movie.This movie is excellent, and I think we need more like it. Cast is phenomenal. Plot is alright. Movie is very well made.Michael Shannon is a great pick as Elvis. I honestly can't think of who else would have done better. J. Phoenix? Maybe, but I think Shannon actually would've done the better job still. I know Elvis doesn't talk the way Shannon does, but so what? Maybe it is historically inaccurate, but I feel it made for a better movie than if Shannon had to fake Elvis's accent. I think movies should always use Shannon as Elvis from now on.Kevin Spacey plays an excellent Nixon, also. I honestly can't even believe how well he portrayed and acted like him. Movies should always use him for this role, just like I said regarding Shannon and Elvis.All in all, a great movie. It's not going to make lines around the block (if it was even released theatrically), but it should keep you from being bored one night."
" Nice Little Gem
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,7,"I didn't expect to like this little gem, but I ended up really enjoying myself. This is what indie movies were always about, showing quirky little stories on a limited budget outside of the Hollywood behemoth. Here we see a glimpse into 2 legendary characters, played brilliantly by Shannon and Spacey. Shannon doesn't play an Elvis impersonator, but brings out a depth to his role which no impersonator can equal. The same for Spacey, who doesn't look anything like Nixon but you believe it's Nixon because Spacey does a fantastic job of getting to something deeper.I was a little confused seeing a slightly strange Tom Hanks playing a minor role, but then realized it was his son Colin. I love the way Elvis is shown as seriously he coolest guy that ever lived. People fall over themselves trying to help him everywhere he goes. Girls swoon, men turn into dribbling lackeys. Elvis, perfectly aware of the impact he has doesn't abuse people but keeps his cool, always playing the role people want to see. It's what celebrities used to be like."
" Only Michael Shannon
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,8,Could pull off such a feat of being someone he looks nothing like. He's just that good.
" Why not write the script as it truly happened?
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,3,"Terrible casting, Elvis was the ultimate extrovert, very gregarious. A Las Vegas impersonator would have performed a more accurate portrayal. And, too bad the writer and/or director didn't read the Smithsonian archives, the truth is actually funnier, and more in line w/Elvis's personality. I mean - wardrobe dept. can't you at least get Elvis's bright purple outfit right? ðŸ™„... I love Netflix, but possibly one of their worse movies per true story genre. And, why not play some actual Elvis music in a movie about Elvis?"
" Not essential, but funny indie film
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,7,"The film is not essential, but it was a funny character film. Indie films have fallen away over the years, so it was nice to find this film. Shannon is slightly underused as The King and never reaches the usual level he injects. Spacey is wasted and his role feels more like a cameo. The film is good, but not great. The film builds to a confrontation that lacks the strength of the build-up. Good actors are just good in their roles, when they should've knocked it out of the park."
" Spacey
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,10,Kevin Spacey is always marvelous. We want him back.
" Oddly funny and entertaining little movie
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,6,"This movie was insane. The whole premise was strange and the regular music breaks just added to the weird vibe; making it almost feel like a TV sitcom or lifetime movie.Despite the weirdness (or maybe even because of it) Shannon and Spacey deliver excellent performances in their respective roles. Shannon's Elvis is hilarious. He really does thrive in such roles, and seems to bring his unique madcap weirdness to every film he stars in. The film also feels very authentically 70s. Every one looked like they were having a bit of fun with this.All the celebrity gushing was a bit weird and tiresome though, and at times, I thought to myself; ""what the hell am I watching?"" - but despite this, it kept me engaged throughout and even gave me a few laughs. Perhaps the short running time helped hold my attention, or the sheer insanity of it all - I'm not sure. But it was a fairly light, enjoyable 86 minutes regardless."
" Blind Casting Agents?
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,1,Are you kidding me? I watched exactly 3mins of this film. Once I saw who played Elvis I switched off. Casting this bloke to play one of the most handsome and charismatic men in modern history was probably the reason this film flopped and whoever made that choice should pay for the loss out of their own pocket. Don't get me wrong. He is a very good actor but the last person Is choose to play Elvis with his pock marked face and dead eyes. Kevin Spacey would have been a better choice to play him! Disappointing as the opening credits were fabulous. Waste NO time with this rubbish.
" Hoodwinked By A Strangely Funny Story
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,3,"This script is based upon a picture taken of Elvis and Nixon together in the White House in 1971. The meeting is an actual piece of history. The script here leading up to the meeting is funny and the meeting is a huge farce. That's why the credits have the disclaimer about ""any resemblance to persons living or dead...""Both Shannon's Elvis and Spacey's Nixon are laugh out loud funny. The train of thought of why Elvis wants to meet Nixon is insane. Their conversation is flat out crazy. Elvis carrying a gun in his ankle holster into the oval office? You have to be kidding. It is kind of shocking to think Elvis carried all these guns. I kind of wonder about the fact behind that.The best part of the film script is when Elvis waiting to go into the Oval Office recounts a story of his still born twin brother who died minutes before he was born. That is the most dramatic part of this one. As for the undercover agent part and the whole Nixon meeting, it does not ring as true. If Elvis actually supported what he says to Nixon here, it would be amazing.Quirky comedy is in the script, but I do not take this as a serious script. The reality appears to be warped and out of control. I just did not get the feel that this meeting happened this way. In fact, I disclaim this and wonder if Nixon only wanted an Elvis autograph for one daughter as portrayed here? As for the 2 having anything in common? Spacey looks to young to be Nixon here ."
" Better Than Ave Comedy: Elvis & Nixon
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,6,"This is not the greatest comedy of all time; not even close. But it is entertaining and watchable, and that is better than half of what is supposed to pass for comedy films these days. Michael Shannon, the fine actor from Boardwalk Empire and several other excellent efforts, plays The King and is very good. Spacey, of course, is always good in every role he plays, and excels in this one as Nixon as an old, fuddy-duddy trying to be cool. The interaction between Nixon and Elvis is fascinating to listen to and watch. This is a mildly amusing film that is fine to view to pass a few harmless hours of nostalgia recollection."
" a bio- about a president and a rock star coming together
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,8,Review: I found this to be interesting because I am not really a fan of Elvis but he had the power to march into the oval office and arrange a meeting with the president. The direction and screenplay are both really good. The casting is good and so is the acting. Michael Shannon does a great job but Kevin Spacy seems lost playing former president Richard Nixon. All in all I would give this three out of a possible five stars.
" Seriously helarious one !!!!!!!!
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,9,I would say this is a kind of Wes Anderson style of taking the movie. I really liked the parts especially the conversation between Elvis and Nixon. Initially looking at the first scene when Elvis shoots the TV with his hand pistol being vexed off the situation I thought its a king of serious movie. But from the next scene the story gets the real fun drive. I liked the character Johnny who helps Elvis to get what he is looking for just being a friend in his childhood. The final conversation is really cool especially when Elvis demonstrates the Karate moves to Nixon even though Nixon's assistants will give some prologue of what not to do with the president. Of all the movie projects Elvis is more heart driven person than thinking off the thought. The movie did lasting impression on my mind impressed with Michael Shannon's acting of being Elvis the King. For new bees who are trying to watch this movie do not over expect off this movie just watch it on a lighter note you will definitely enjoy the fun rides.
" Some Humor, Passable Nixon, Ghastly Elvis
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,6,"If you can get past the ghastly appearance of Michael Shannon as Elvis, this isn't really a bad film. The brief real-life meeting of Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon turns into a whimsical look at both men, with lots of humor, some great period music, and some surprisingly poignant character moments featuring both American icons. I have nothing but respect for Michael Shannon. In a show like BOARDWALK EMPIRE, where he plays the rigid, fanatical, psychotic Federal Agent Nelson Van Alden, he's absolutely mesmerizing. But casting Michael Shannon as Elvis is like casting Boris Karloff as Rudolph Valentino. Shannon's Elvis is a ghastly-looking creature with a fake black wig that looks like it just died on the top of his head. And yet the first half hour of the movie is nothing but an endless procession of pretty girls blushing and fainting at the mere sight of him. It really starts the movie off on the wrong foot. On the other hand, Kevin Spacey is surprisingly effective as Richard Nixon. The movie has enormous fun playing with the double-sided fish out of water concept. Nixon is tough and confident when dealing with hard issues like war, politics, and money, but almost childishly insecure about his looks and sexuality. Elvis is completely at ease with his sex appeal and celebrity but almost childishly eager to prove himself as a ""grown man.""The real strength of this movie is that its best moments really are built on the way these two great heroes get to know each other. It's amazing that in real life they only spoke for fifteen or twenty minutes, but the movie makes you feel as if they're getting to know each other over a period of weeks. I loved when Nixon had a long speech by himself about how good-looking guys always make fun of him and how he hates them, yet when Elvis tells him he's not that bad looking he's incredibly flattered. By the same token, when Elvis talks about how much he has to offer as a ""Federal Agent at large"" you can see how Nixon goes way out of the way not to hurt his feelings, even as his face shows he realizes Elvis is really out there. While both the leads are incredible in this film, it's interesting that the younger men really steal the show at times. Colin Hanks as Bud Krogh and Alex Pettyfer as Jerry Schilling are both completely likable and believable in the role of loyal followers who try to help their heroes while carving out their own identities. If you can get past the awful casting of Michael Shannon as Elvis, there's a lot to enjoy about ELVIS & NIXON."
" Nothing can stop the King...
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,9,"...and not 'Nixon and Elvis' or something like that. Let's keep this in mind... and let us not hurry to express strong protest about Michael Shannon: But this man is not Elvis! He is not talking like him, he is not walking like him, he is not even singing! If we want to find the ideal Elvis, one ride in Vegas is enough to have a dozen. Here we have the man behind the fringe, and the sideburns. The man with the divine voice and southern gentle accent flooded with hyper-patriotic feelings and worries! 1970 expires and Elvis watches television from his luxurious mansion and resents! These Communists will eventually f... everything up! And drugs have been rotting the minds of young people! Go crap! Something we must do. Rather, something I have to do myself! Country is in desperate need! And I, the King will offer my service! But who should I contact? The King cannot be conversing with the inferiors. The King should come into contact with the Boss... and where is the Boss? In the White House of course! But will the President accept me? Will he be available for me? Silly question... For a moment I forgot that I am the King... and who can deny anything to a crowned?"
" ""I want to get a badge. A federal badge.""
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,7,"I had a little trouble believing Elvis Presley would have been this laid back in real life. Michael Shannon's portrayal made it look like he was walking around in a trance most of the time. I'm unfamiliar with Shannon the actor, in fact this is only the second time I've seen him, the first being in his role as the vicious government agent in ""The Shape of Water"". I don't know if he was the best choice to play Elvis Presley; if Kurt Russell wasn't too old for the role, he could have done as good a job as he did as an Elvis impersonator in 2001's ""3000 Miles From Graceland"". Shannon appears rail thin as Presley, with a skeletal face that looked to me like a cross between Don Imus and Boris Karloff. As for Kevin Spacey portraying Richard Nixon, I thought the characterization came off as more of a caricature than a real impersonation of the former President. He probably used Nixon's language appropriately, but I don't envision Nixon laying all over his desk the way Spacey did in the story. He almost looked like a reptile looking for his next meal, and rather creepy at that.It's pretty difficult to imagine that the way Elvis Presley got to see Richard Nixon occurred along the lines depicted in this story. One of the things I got a kick out of and reflected on was how Elvis imagined 1970 as a 'make or break time' for the country, what with rampant drug use escalating and massive demonstrations against the war in Vietnam. And I thought to myself, has there ever been a time in recent memory when it didn't seem like a make or break time for America? And we always manage to work our way through it, just like we will in the present day.One thing for sure though, if you're interested in this story as history, it will breeze by in what seems a matter of minutes. It's just under an hour and a half long, but it seemed like it was over in fifteen minutes when I watched it. So quick in fact, that there wasn't time for an announcement that Elvis had left the building."
" Surreal and interesting, but not cohesive
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,6,"It is a pretty surreal film in many ways. Elvis dreaming of becoming an undercover agent? Two historical figures' incidental meeting becoming a bigger than life story? It is bizarre. But it works as a strange farce, and it works even better as a meditation on celebrity. I wish that it had transcended those quirky little funny moments into a cohesive story, but it worked pretty well anyway."
" Federal Agent at-large
",2017-10-25 00:00:00,4,"This is a fictional account of the historical meeting of the King and the President.Kevin Spacey wasn't a good cast for Nixon and Michael Shannon was the worst Elvis I have seen since that Chinese guy in that ""Ghost Tribe"" film. They both looked like fools. It looked like they wanted to make a camp film, but then got cold feet and attempted to make it into something normal. I think the film would have worked better with an all Japanese cast and subtitles. Works as an MST feature.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
" Come Together
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,7,"When the surviving Three-atles got together for a 16-minute conversation featured in The Beatles Anthology in 1995, they spent much of the time talking about another icon: Elvis. Like which of them met him last (George) and what he was like.So it figures that when Elvis himself met another icon, Richard Nixon, in the Oval Office in December 1970, they wound up talking about the Beatles, finding common ground on how much the two men disliked them.""They may not actually be in the employ of the Communists, but if encouraging revolution doesn't sound like subversive behavior, I don't know what is,"" the King (Michael Shannon) tells a nodding 37 (Kevin Spacey).Whether this was the actual spark that transformed a trivial historical footnote into the stuff of legend is hard to say. But director Liza Johnson and the writers do what they can to make sure the viewer is amused and engaged.Two things lift this film out of its curious anecdotal substance: Sharp editing by Michael Taylor and Sabine Hoffman that pops off the screen with the help of a fine vintage Memphis-soul-infused score; and Shannon's solid performance as ""E.""It's true he doesn't look the part, or sound that much like Presley, but Shannon grounds his performance in Elvis's well-known sensitivity. He knows he's a star and will get the big treatment wherever he goes, and you can see he's uncomfortable with that, as well as the responsibility of being gracious to the people he meets even when they are acting like idiots. He may not remember this moment, but he knows they will, and wants to do right by them.""When I walk into a room, everybody remembers their first kiss with one of my songs playing in the background,"" Elvis explains, in between dabbing his eye sockets with Preparation H to conceal the bags. ""But they never see me.""Spacey is more of a caricature, but a good one. He's not the subject but the object of the piece, and plays his few scenes for comedy and some surprising moments of empathy. For all his bigness, it appears Nixon is a little star-struck, too.""Elvis & Nixon"" is a deliberately minor effort, weighing in at well under 90 minutes. It features some tangents about one of the people behind that meeting, future manager Jerry Schilling (Alex Pettyfer), and his anxieties about meeting his prospective parents-in-law, which feels belabored and concocted in the direction of serving Schilling's ego. (He was a producer of this project.)In the end, though, the takeaway I got from this was pleasure, particularly a final section where Elvis and Nixon finally meet, and discuss the miracle that is America for both of them. It reminds me of the HBO films they used to make in the 1990s, before it became about big ratings and ""Game Of Thrones"" and the idea was to give a platform to a film that wasn't likely to draw big box-office. I just hope Amazon keeps it up with this kind of original programming. ""Elvis & Nixon"" is a promising start."
" Two Titans...
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,6,"An unlikely battle of wills, and eventually, perhaps an unexpected meeting of mindsÂ…Michael Shannon looks NOTHING LIKE Elvis - but he does at least manage to capture a sense of the aura that surrounded the manÂ… Spacey is a more comfortable fit, in his role.Over the course of its brief running time, it's an entertaining hypothesis about just how exactly two giant cultural figures occupied the same space for a short moment of history."
" If you love Elvis this movie will just tick you off
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,1,"Having been an Elvis fan for the past 46 years, I was enraged by Michael Shannon's portrayal. He is both too old and too coarse in appearance to play Elvis. Elvis was full of light and energy. This actor is flat, one dimensional and appears to be under the influence of large amounts of Thorazine. Pathetic! I am not sure who was in charge of casting, but they missed the boat entirely. the movie was labeled a comedy but I never found anything funny about it."
" The King visits the President
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,6,"""Elvis & Nixon"" from 2016 is the partially-fictionalized story of the famous meeting between the rock 'n' roll star and President Richard Nixon. I say partially fictionalized because Nixon hadn't yet started taping everything, but there are true elements, as much of this story came from someone who was there, Jerry Schilling, played here by Alex Petyfer.Elvis got it into his head that he wanted to go undercover as an FBI agent and snuff out drug dealers. But for his efforts, he wanted a badge. Since Elvis was on drugs himself, one questions the whole operation. However naive he may have been, though, the King genuinely wanted to do some good. It's not known if he ever did go undercover. Elvis here is played by Michael Shannon. He doesn't look like Elvis, but tinted glasses, a black wig, a jumpsuit, and gold jewelry will take you far when it comes to Elvis. He has the soft southern voice and the politeness that Elvis was known for, as well his feeling of being trapped by the ""Elvis"" persona. He's also hilarious - after being told not to drink the Dr. Pepper, as it is for the President, and not to eat the M&Ms, as they're for the President, he asks for a bottle opener and starts downing M&Ms. Kevin Spacey is a brilliant Nixon - he has the voice, the posture, and the facial expressions.As others have pointed out, the photo of Elvis and Nixon is the most requested photo in the National Archives.Not much happens in this low-key film, but due to the star performances, it manages to be entertaining."
" An interesting look into an unlikely get-together of two highly recognisable figures of their era
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,7,"Elvis & Nixon is a historical comedy-drama starring Michael Shannon and Kevin Spacey. Based on the 1970 meeting between U.S. President Richard Nixon and rock star Elvis Presley, the film is an interesting look into an unlikely get-together of two highly recognisable figures of that era.In December 1970, the world famous singer Elvis Presley (Michael Shannon) requests an important meeting with President Richard Nixon (Kevin Spacey). However, due to Nixon's busy schedule and lack of understanding of what is popular with younger voters, Elvis' inquiry is repeatedly rejected. Eventually, though, some strings are pulled and the iconic king of rock 'n' roll manages to secure a one-on-one with the President.Despite the relatively thin source material to work from, the film makes fairly good use of it. There are some scenes in the film that feel like they were added to pad out the runtime to a reasonable movie-length rather than expand upon the story. Michael Shannon's convincing performance as the king of rock 'n' roll is fun to watch, he nails Elvis' voice and body language. One can't help but feel amused at the laid-back way Elvis acts in front of one of the most powerful men in the world. Kevin Spacey was quite good too as President Nixon, but like Anthony Hopkins in the 1995 film Nixon, he mainly relies on playing the role through impersonating his voice and slouching, due to his lack of physical resemblance to the real person. Also, it is quite strange seeing Spacey play a real-life President after seeing him play a noteworthy fictional one on House of Cards.I rate it 6.5/10."
" Okay comedy, not as good as the original
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,7,"Good performances, tongue in cheek comedy, worth watching if you haven't yet heard the story.Still not as funny as the 1997 original Elvis Meets Nixon, narrated by Dick Cavett. That was a quicker paced outright 'mockumentary', no big names but excellent acting all the way. Hard to find though."
" Spacey steals it.
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,8,"This film almost passed me by until I stumbled across it on Amazon Prime. From the 'in period' opening credits to the bad wigs to the bro's in the coffee shop the cheese is strong and thick, but it's a very enjoyable film whichever way you approach it. Michael Shannon (who was completely new to me) neither looks nor sounds like Elvis but somehow fills the role very well, exposing a rather sad, isolated individual who just wants to be noticed for something other than being 'The King'. But the film is stolen IMO by Kevin Spacey, who captures ol' Tricky Dicky perfectly - the growling voice, the stoop, the hand gestures. Not only that, but he injects a wry wit to his part which goes a long way toward lifting this movie out of a dullness which threatened to engulf it at several points. I could easily watch it again."
" mildly amusing
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,6,It's December 1970. Entertainer Elvis Presley (Michael Shannon) is distressed about the effects of drugs and the counter-culture on America. He recruits his friend Jerry Schilling (Alex Pettyfer) on a mission to be named Federal-Agent-At-Large to go undercover. They show up at a White House gate to get a meeting with President Richard Nixon (Kevin Spacey). Nixon refuses at first despite his aides Egil Krogh (Colin Hanks) and Dwight Chapin (Evan Peters)'s pleas. Jerry has the idea to get Nixon through his daughter Julie.This movie is mildly amusing. The history is possible. The performances of Shannon and Spacey are intriguing. Shannon may not be completely correct but he brings a self-possessed actualized personality to the role. The movie plays it mostly straight. There aren't any big surprises but I do like Nixon's initial refusal. There are plenty of light moments which leaves the movie feeling lightly fun. It would be more compelling to go overboard with the broad comedy or go darker. This ends up existing in the milky white toast middle.
" A really fun (and quite amusing) movie, but nothing too memorable.
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,8,"'ELVIS & NIXON': Four Stars (Out of Five)A comedy-drama based on the real life meeting between Elvis Presley and President Richard Nixon, at the White House in 1970. It stars Michael Shannon and Kevin Spacey, as the two iconic historical figures, and it costars Alex Pettyfer, Johnny Knoxville, Colin Hanks and Evan Peters. The movie was directed by Liza Johnson, and it was scripted by Cary Elwes (the actor), Joey Sagal and Hanala Sagal. It was released on Amazon, by Amazon studios (following a brief indie theatrical run), and it's received mostly positive reviews from critics. I really enjoyed it.The film is based on true events, which took place on December 21st, 1970, at the White House. The immensely popular singer, and movie star, Elvis Presley (Shannon), just showed up there, and requested a meeting with President Richard Nixon. He wanted to ask him for a Federal Agent (at large) badge, so he could go undercover, and bust drug dealers and hippie problem causers. Nixon was originally reluctant to meet with the star, but he later reconsidered. The picture of the two together is now legendary.The movie definitely plays more like a silly comedy, than a serious historical drama, but that doesn't mean it isn't true. I'm sure the writers took a lot of creative liberty with the material, and exaggerated it quite a bit, but I believe the premise basically could have happened. Shannon and Spacey are both fantastic in the leads, and the supporting actors are all well cast too. It's a really fun (and quite amusing) movie, but it's also nothing especially memorable.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Y0XE5jyxMFQ"
" Two actors having a blast make this meeting worthwhile
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,6,"Out of all the people I would've ever expected to see play Elvis ""The King"" Presley I don't think in my wildest imagination that I would've chosen Michael ""Nelson Van Alden"" Shannon to don the black clothes, stunning sunglasses and expressive side burns in an incarnation of the pop superstar.It's an odd choice of main star for an equally odd yet never the less entertaining movie event in Liza Johnson's Elvis and Nixon, a dramatization of the time the music icon stopped by to say ""Hi"" to Richard Nixon, eat M and M's and drink Dr. Pepper.Shannon is a capable performer and while he never totally convinces in the looks department he certainly isn't the worst big screen Elvis that we've seen and when his eventual meeting with Kevin Spacey's (hamming it up and having a blast) Richard Nixon finally takes centre stage, the two extremely capable actors chew the scenery together and make the journey well and truly worth taking.Comprising only a few days in the life and times of these two memorable figures, Johnson's film is slight in all accounts with the most drama stemming from a donut shop stopover or Elvis getting a rundown from the White House staff on how to behave around the President but there's an air of folly and joy that embeds Johnson's film and with supports from the likes Alex Pettyfer, Johnny Knoxville, Evan Peters and Colin Hanks, Elvis and Nixon consistently remains an enjoyable film without ever being a thrilling one but really it exists solely to offer us a glimpse into a snapshot of time that in its day was something of a nation defining event.If you're seeking something that is going to shine a light on either of the in depth characters that are Elvis Aaron Presley or Richard Nixon, Elvis and Nixon will leave you rather disappointed but for a fun and unique examination of a tiny portion of their lives and behaviours, this is one of the recent memories oddest and most enjoyable middle of the road experiences, anchored by two great performers enjoying each other's company.3 sassy donut shop customers out of 5"
" short story but know how to tell it
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"I know that Michael Shannon did not give us the Elvis. But, that is not the point. I honestly think that you should watch this movie right now because, it's gentle and heart-warming movie. I'm not American and i don't know about Richard Nixon. I don't know about the impersonation. But he absolutely is giving the edge to the movie. Those two guys combination was good and the dynamic back and forth script helps too.it's a legit good watch movie. i know that Elvis is so iconic but we never got that part right and i think this time it's right (except for the look). i wouldn't say it's the best out of Elvis that we can see but it is totally worth seeing! overall: it's funny. it's charming (literally!), and hell yeah"
" Based on actual events â€“ uh huh!
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,6,"Yes Nixon met The King way back in 1970 and this is a recreation of how that came about and what happened when the King met Mr Watergate himself in the Oval Office. Now this is very amusing indeed and for the most part the period detail and make up are all excellent. Kevin Spacey as Nixon is just superb â€“ as always. I am also a big fan of Michael Shannon believing him to be a great character actor â€“ but this was a stretch for him which he did very well for the most part.Jonny Knoxville also appears as does Colin Hanks and they are all spot on, however Alex Pettyfer as Elvis's friend Jerry got the most interesting role â€“ with space to grow and give a fine performance. There has been some chatter about the veracity of this film but I am firmly in the camp that says 'never let the truth get in the way of a good story' and by jingo this is a ruddy good story â€“ recommended."
