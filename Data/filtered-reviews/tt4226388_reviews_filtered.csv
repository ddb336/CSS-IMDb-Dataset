" Amazing feat
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Yes, the big part of the film's appeal is the single shot from beginning to end. The camera doesn't merely follow the actors from room to room, it moves with their emotions, providing an immersive experience."
" Unique and authentic
",2021-04-01 00:00:00,8,"This is one of the movies, that you will never forget for the rest of your life. Because of the authentic and overwhelming feeling. As if a camera team is following that young lady for a night and a day in Berlin. Inside a pub, she meets a couple of guys and she joins them. They become friends and the following hours evolve into the biggest adventure of her life. But it gets more and more serious and slowly it turns into a nightmare. At the end of the movie, it feels as if she will wake up at any moment and it only was a bad dream. But it wasn't. This is exactly what the movie feels like. It is a great movie."
" Weak plot!
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,5,"I enjoyed the movie. Acting and camera were great. However, the plot was completely implausible. Maybe it's just me, but I don't know of any woman who would join a group of drunk and violent strangers (men only) for a ""private party"" on a rooftop. It became even more implausible when she decided to help them as a driver in a bank robbery after being threatened by heavily armed gangsters. It just doesn't make sense. How can people who give this movie 10 stars ignore this?"
" Lame
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,1,"Implausible, I mean yeah it could happen but you got to be pretty damn dumb to carry out a heist like that. Lot of unnecessary fillers as well...."
" Medicore.
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,5,The film has many mistakes however you need to take that into consideration as the film is filmed in one continuous shot without post production.
" Damn! That Esclated quickly and smoothly.
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,9,"It is my fourth movie after 1917(2019),Long Day's Journey into night(2018),One Cut of the Dead(2017); that consists of a long Single take and i have to say that it manages to deliver like these movies.While these above mentioned movies had cuts but they were beautifully hidden that you could not even notice them, this movie was shot entirely in a sequence in one go.Just have to give a hats off to the Technical team and Actors who not only deliver a consistent and amazing performance but were also able to incorporate so much in this 2hr18min of the movie, from bar parties, to rooftop conversations, to playing piano, to organising a heist, to getting away from police, to shootouts, damn that was neat.Just watch it if you are not irritated by no cuts, as these movies are just great, as they have taken the concept of long cuts to a completely new level, allowing people to experience theatre on Screen."
" Harrowing
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,8,"If you want a film that takes you from the soaring freedom of youth to the choking spittle of death, then this is the film for you. It's a rough emotional ride, full of tension, and I really can't say it's a lot of fun. Imagine if German's made Reservoir Dogs, but with more details, and without the cool. Prepare for a heavy duty full-on film experience."
" Good first half
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,6,"Good first half. Nice mood from filming everything in one take. Second half is a little bit annoying as the protagonists act very irrational even considering the circumstances. This ruins the good impression of the film as a whole, the plot could have been written to be much better without much trouble."
" Love it!
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,9,"Wow! The first time I saw this movie I was really blown away.
I was truly amazed by the fact that the movie is shot in a single take.
Everything feels so natural and authentic here."
" Riveting masterpiece
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,10,"I was lucky to see this movie on Belgian tv: without commercial brakes.
Loss of words... go see it!!"
" Spend as much effort on the script as you do on cinematography
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,6,Without a doubt this movie is technical masterful. And I don't even agree that the one shot is a gimmick because as it should it serves a purpose here. Our two leads have amazing chemistry and no wonder Laia Costa continues to do big things.That being said these are basically two movies. For one hour it is a great movie about young people meeting in Berlin at night. It has a certain romantic to it. Quit after that!But then two things happen. It turns into a very different movie and secondly our main character Victoria looses every credibility. The choices she makes in this movie no real person would ever make. The script supposedly only had 14 pages. This is to me is when a director get's lost in his technical tools forgetting that the foundation of every movie is a good story. Victoria has none.
" NOT a masterpiece - far too long and boring
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,4,"Could've been a great movie if it was 1 hour shorter...
Many scenes don't add anything to the plot and could've been either left out or at least shortened. For instance: The movie runs already 50 min. until the plot adds pace, and you understand what's the deal.
Don't get me wrong: I don't have a problem with realistic character development and some evolvement of the storyline, but 10 min. of non-sense bad piano play of the two main characters don't add anything here and just creates the desire that the flick finishes..."
" Cats parallels
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Lots of cats(2019) parallels but let's not get into that. What an impressive feat of cinema! Impressive acting full of improv that pretty much always hit the mark. I didn't notice that it was done in a single take until like 20 minutes in because the movie was so well blocked and continuously pretty that it didn't need the crutch of me knowing that it was really hard to pull off (at least initially). I will say that I was more invested with the movie before the heist was introduced. Victoria meeting all these German guys was really well handled and truthful, and I was interested in seeing it go further in a simpler direction plot wise than it ended up going because the characters were dynamic and fun in a context of them just hanging out and introducing their world to this girl. Once it became a heist movie, it still continued to be good, just in a less classy way, as I was more and more like ""woah single take"" and less like ""what are these people going to learn about each other and how will these revelations repel and attract them to/from each other?"". The heist sequence and the chase after were well done and successfully tense but weren't very distinguished beyond the single take thing. It ended up feeling melodramatic as the premise got a lot sillier than the established tone permitted. I was not touched when Victoria cried at the end, especially with the score obnoxiously ramped up. I really liked it in the end, but the more complex it got the less I cared. Cats would have been cool if they did it in a single shot. They're similar movies in that they're both about a someone named Victoria who meets a bunch of wacky characters without really meaning to. And both Victorias look the same in the face."
" Berlin- ghost town
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,2,"This film is something different, but scenes are too long, dialogues are stupid.. dissapointed"
" NOT a horror movie
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,1,"Pages upon pages of wannabe film critics rambling on and on about this being a ""technological masterpiece "" (btw, a pretentious opinion is NOT a spoiler).
All you need to know is that this is not a horror flick, it's just horrible, that's all."
" Riveting
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,9,"Anxiety-inducing and irresistible.Victoria rises to a nerve-racking, methodically composed crescendo, after carefully and patiently lulling you into an uneasy sense of trust.The story is so simple, but terrifyingly effective. The characters are more intelligent than they first let on, and their performances are excellent.The tension is real. You will feel surges of adrenaline.
If you love crime thrillers, watch this."
" Very nearly great
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,7,"I think it's fair to say this film is split into 2 stretches. The second of which, is arguably outstanding. The film manages to be very tense without a grandure to the action sequences. The performances are brilliant. The constantly long shot and close up camera work adds to the intense nature.That can be said for the 2nd half, HOWEVER, the first hour of this film I found intensly dull. I understand what it was going for, that said, I don't feel it needed to go on as long as it did. It could have done what it needed to in half the time.One of the biggest draws to this film is it's unique 1-long-take approach. This, at points as I've said earlier benefits the film and adds to the atmosphere. However, it can also detract from the film. Theres a reason we don't often see the 'scenes-between-scenes' an it's because they wouldn't be interesting to watch. This films highlights this, I can't help but feel if an amount of the transitions between places were done with editing rather than tracking shots the film would have worked better.Overall, I can't say that the film is impressive or bad. It's definitely worth a watch, it is interesting both in its engaging story and unique approach to construction. However, said unique approach has its share of flaws as well as it's impressive moments. 7/10"
" For those of you who think crime dramas have become a cliche, watch this
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,9,"You feel like you're really there, maybe it's because the whole movie is shot in a single take ( amazing! I know ) but it feels so real, the interactions are insanely relaistic and so is the buildup, it all happens in a single night yet nothing seems rushed! It has really cute and soft romantic moments with so much fun but it's intensely gripping after the first quarter for entirely different reasons. It's totally worth your time. One of the best movies of recent times tbh"
" The best movie i have seen in a while!
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,10,"Omg. I am still under the impression of this movie. It has caused for me such a burst of emotion that i haven't expirienced from another movie in a while.
The thing that have moved me a lot was the first half of the movie. The way Victoria acted with the boys, without fear and with joy and flirtation that it reminded me of me and my ex and that time of my life.. i was so waiting for them to kiss or hug or something to happen and the way the story goes it got me like... breathaking. Then the second half of the movie... i was filled with fear, anticipation, anguish, i was so glad that they have made it but also so mad that they were acting so careless afterwords... The best scene for me was the one in the club- the way the camera movies and we can see only pure joy and listen only to music but also feel the love in the air in that scene, it was the best scene ever! the long last kiss...i have died right then. The smile on my face once again. And then the end.... almost put me to tears..
Soo i will talk and think about this movie for a long time for sure."
" This is a movie for adolescents.
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,5,"The story will appeal to the unseasoned viewer. The plot is simple, it doesn't draw you in with complicated characters or relationships. The single take is a whopping 2:18 and :45 too long. That Victoria garnered a 7.6 when John Wick gets a 7.4 on IMDb is a baffling revelation. If you're young, you might like this effort but if you're over 25, you probably will want your 2:18 back."
" A waste of time
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,1,See the other reviews that rated this a one star out of ten.
" Idiotic and chaotic... sorry
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,4,"Just few words... I didn't like the movie, the characters and I didn't feel any emotions, but one... anger! A bunch of stupid people are able only to do stupid things that clearly shows they don't have any brain, first of all the girl. Not even an average intelligent girl would do all the stupid things she did... it's not believable.
Anyway it's really hard to love any of the characters, I wouldn't save none of them, but the less sympathetic is the girl... you would like to get her and slap her face.
The end is forgettable as the whole movie is... what did I watch? I don't remember..."
" Brilliant
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,9,"This is just a brilliant movie, it is so alive and so natural. It kept thinking after i finished watching, how did they really shot this movie. A must watch"
" Expensive thrills
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,7,"There is something hallucinatory about films that seem as if they have been captured in a single shot. They dare you to look away and miss something pertinent happening on the screen. They open up your mind to the possibility of feeling like a voyeur, with the camera flitting between the protagonists._Victoria_ (Languages- German, Spanish and English) is heady. It works brilliantly as a gripping thriller. It also has its heart in the right spot and explores the subtext of forging string bonds, when ephemeral ones should be formed and of feeling lonely in foreign cities.The acting is breathtakingly real by the largely unknown cast. The pace is frenetic.Highly recommended for those trying to score their next high in thrills, of the expensive variety."
" What movie did the critics see?
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,2,"This movie is as boring as watching grass grow. It's not fast paced as some people said, there's not really a story, it's just some guys hanging out for about an hour and then a boring twist happens. There's nothing but extremely boring events in this movie. Avoid like the plague!"
" Excellent performances and cinematography
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,10,"So, this is what a movie filmed through one continuous shot looks like. I had been trying to wrap my head around that since I had heard about the new movie ""1917."" The movie was exceptionally well written and sports superb bilingual performances in German and broken English. The one-continuous-shot approach absorbed me into the action and made me identify with the rakish characters despite their criminal acts. And kudos to Laia Costa for enduring through all she went through!"
" At Last an action masterpiece
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,9,"An action movie with realistic prospects at Last. It is all One take, fact that puts the bar pretty high for that kind of cinema."
" Must watch
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,10,"This has held the spot of my favourite movie of all time, for a while now. It's a very well constructed drama, which unfolds in a way that will have you hooked throughout the entirety of it. The characters are well acted out and their chemistry together leads to a gripping and empathy creating experience. A big congratulations to Laia Costa and Frederick Lau who shine the most. The specialty to this movie which some might call a gimmick is the one shot. I do not think it is pretentious nor gimmicky. It provides the movie with tension by creating the immediacy that even a well edited movie can't create. It's very emersive where and lends itself well in the more intense scenes 10/10 for me."
" Brilliant
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,10,"One of, if not the best movies I've ever watched. I'm speechless, but let me try to explain. It draws you in from the beginning and doesn't let go. You get the impression she's yearning for a connection from the beginning. She's hasn't really lived a life up to this point. As a brilliant pianist, and bravo for that moment, she's lived a life of discipline and solitude. She has what appears to be a unique ability to go to another place, or get into the zone as a side effect of her training. It's shot in a way that gives you her viewpoint throughout the movie and doesn't let up until, you know it's over 2 plus hours later."
" Absolutely amazing!
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,10,"Forgetting the fact that the whole film really was shot in just 1 take, it's a great engaging film and it truly feels like you're hanging out through Berlin at night with some young Berliners. The film is full of romance, friendship, suspense, twists and turns, it kept my complete attention throughout.. . But it was shot in just 1 take!!! And you could never tell. Amazing, never seen anything like it. Amazing technical job and amazing acting. A must see."
" WHAT AN ADVENTURE.
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,8,Very well made thriller with a good plot and interesting characters sewn together. An amazing cinematographic achievement and what an adventure.
" Cinema milestone!
",2020-03-21 00:00:00,10,For me this is the best german movie ever! Pure magic moments...
" What a crap!!
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,3,"Usually IMDB ratings fully match with my opinion. Therefore I was glad to find this Movie on Netflix.But wow, this Movie is terrible. Stupid story which is very unbelievable. There is not one likeable person at all, and you really hope for a bad end for all of them.A big waste of time!!!"
" An Unique Cinematic Experience
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,10,"Victoria maybe one of the best films to come out of Europe in the last 20 years. First of all it is incredibly unique. Shot in only one take, telling the story of one night in real time while effortlessly changing locations and using countless extras choreographed to perfection. It is wonderful to look at with great cinematography taking the one take technique to unseen heights. The story is interesting, the characters engaging and the acting is top notch leaving you on the edge of your seat for the whole duration of the one take."
" The only question is
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,1,What did the director and the crew took when they made this movie. Cheap rubbish film.
" I don't speak german
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,7,"Two hours in the night of Berlin.This is a picture of how a girl named Victoria leaves the nightclub at four in the morning and meets a company of four German guys of a guilty appearance. Together they begin to have fun, wander around at night in Berlin, and then plunge together into such troubles that it was simply impossible to think about at the beginning of the story."
" Leaves your body full of adrenaline
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,10,"Sometimes you might play a mind game, that what if your life was a movie. Then you have a weird feeling, when you are kind of walking somewhere ""between the shots"", before the next scene starts, as time usually passes by slowlier in real life, than in movies.This movie gives you a feeling, that you are inside the film, as nothing is cut out. Sometimes it requires improvised nonsence lines, but so is the case in real life, big part of it would be cut out, if it would be a movie.The story is also great and intence, giving you a boost of adrenaline as you don't know what to predict next in this kind of real life simulation.Highly recommend for everyone. I guess the crew had a huge party in Berlin after managing to film this."
" so intense
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,4,"A good cinematography and direction given that it's only done in just one take, if it really does.So stressful, meaning the movie has done its job well.Just not my cup of tea, hence the mediocre rating, still exhilarating and a worthwhile watch if you love the constant pressure."
" One-shot-wonder
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,5,I don't think it's worth it. I prefer Absolute Gigantic.
" Single take 👌👏
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,7,"A runaway party girl is asked by three friendly men to join them as they hit the town. Their wild night of partying turns into a bank robbery. The cinematography is brilliant, no doubt. While film is a single take. It is literally one take, and it takes place all over Berlin, at night, even developing into an intense action movie. Sadly, the second half of ""Victoria"" isn't as breathtaking as the first. the film as a ""kinetic, frenetic, rollercoaster ride"" but said the plot was somewhat implausible."
" Slow, boring, redundant, painful
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,1,"This movie was agonizingly slow. So much drunk rambling, drunk small talk. Some tense moments speckled throughout. I think they try to be realistic with the camera, but it just makes things redundant. I keep tapping, waiting for the scene to move on.Overall felt like a waste of time. Would not recommend."
" I am in shock, why is this popular?
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,1,"Is this a case of the emperors new clothes? How can this be? A film where by the 45 minute mark, nothing has happened? And it is regarded as a good film?Apparently they only have 12 pages of script, which you can tell by the fact that the dialogue is terrible and feels improvised. No surprise it is all improvised. The main lead seems to be on drugs, she staggers along following these dodgy guys in the middle of the night. I kept thinking it was going to turn into some terrible gang rape scene. The tone is all wrong, you don't know whether you should feel worried for her or if its meant to be romantic? It is so confusing. It takes ages and ages of her and these guys wondering around after clubbing. These random strangers, and she is just following them around all night. It goes no where and drags on and on. Then shes along with the head guy from the gang, and they have this REALLY LONG SCENE in a bar at night. The dialogue and acting is like a joke, seriously its like a terrible student film. And the tone is all wrong, this is meant to be charming and romantic? Her sitting along with a thug she met in the street, who seems a bit TOO interested in her? How are we meant to feel as an audience? Really me and two other friends were watching this and we all agree'd it was total crap. I checked and it was only HALF WAS THROUGH and we had been watching for 50 minutes!? It is 2 hours long? Basically its totally un believable and implausible. That this girl would follow this gang of dodgy guys around who seem like they want to rape her. She is helpless and dumb and acts like this the entire time. Then they demand she drives a getaway car after a bank heist. WHAT?? Yes they suddenly out of the blue demand she drives a getaway car? When she has no knowledge of driving in dangerous situations? Seriously? Why would they ask her? Why not wait and just get a new driver... Nothing makes any sense here. They try to say its because she got the driver drunk or something and that is why she not has to take his place? It makes no sense... So we turned it off before anything happened as it was so infuriatingly shit that nothing else happening would redeem the film.The shocking thing about this is it had 9/10 from the guardian, this is better than say, The Shining? Pulp Fiction? I mean comparing it to real films with acting, story lines, events, a script..etc. It really falls a part. The fact it was all shot in one take is pathetic, why ruin your film just to show off about some technical aspect that no one cares about? If they shot the same film normally with cuts and edits and camera angles... you know a storyline and stuff... Then it might have been semi decent. But shooting it all in ONE TAKE?? It is suicide! You need really good filmmakers to pull off such a feat ! Not these student filmmakers!Really not even classified as a film IMO. One of the worst films ever made.Makes me sad for humanity that this is now regarded a decent film."
" Silly
",2019-09-08 00:00:00,6,"Great potential but little performance: of an interesting story the director shows us a boring executive, for it's about scum and all is scum and it's stupid. Yuck in all possible ways, like as if the writer-director was too busy playing around than to focus on the fine performance of his craft."
" So impressive.
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,10,"This is hands down, the best picture for 2015, a German production shot in real-time and in one continuous take (134 minutes). The director, Sebastian Schipper, does a terrific job in a truly challenging project and the result is bound to leave you breathless. The protagonist, the titular Victoria (Laia Costa), is a Spanish tourist visiting Berlin and in the first scene of the film, we see her dancing in a nightclub where she is approached by a company of four local young men who seem to like her. Victoria will start flirting with one of them, Sonne (Frederick Lau), while wandering aimlessly to the deserted roads of the German capital. Unfortunately, one person in the group, nicknamed Boxer (Franz Rogowski), has a shady past which dictates his present and he is forced to make a bank robbery in that same night. Victoria will follow Sonne and Boxer in their dangerous endeavor and things will soon spiral out of control.What makes ""Victoria"" a modern classic is its impeccable cinematography which leaves the audience stunned. In the first half of the movie we just witness the group of protagonists make small talk, walking on empty streets and smoking joints in an abandoned roof. There is nothing special happening as far as the plot is concerned, nevertheless the viewer becomes better acquainted with the main characters during this first hour. The story begins to take shape after Boxer meets a middle-aged gangster who protected him during his past prison sentence. The thug will ask them to do the heist and after that point, everything seems to escalate at a rapid pace.A special mention should be made about the film's wonderful soundtrack, composed mainly by Nils Frahm. There are short interludes in the story where we see the protagonists walk or dance with no dialogue and only the music, that harmonizes beautifully with the film's overall mood and character, can be heard. The intro club song (Dj Koze- Burn With Me) is also strong as dynamite, introducing the protagonist to the audience.I have to dig very deep in my cinema recollections to find a movie shot in that particular manner and being as gripping as ""Victoria"" is. All film fanatics around the world, regardless of their preferences as far as the genre is concerned, will be delighted to watch such an astonishing picture. It is, without doubt, worthy of a 10/10 rating."
" Before sunrise
",2019-08-09 00:00:00,9,"Somehow I managed to watch this film without knowing beforehand that it was a genuine one-take film. Even after finishing it, I assumed the ""single take"" had been faked, like BIRDMAN or Hitchcock's ROPE. The fact that a movie like this, as long as it is, with so many different settings, with quite a bit of elaborate action, with extremely moving and realistic performances, was filmed all at once--well, that is extremely impressive. But even before that dawned on me, I was already extremely impressed. This is an excellent film regardless of what might be deemed a ""gimmick."" This movie will be remembered for being a technical feat, but it should also be regarded as a great accomplishment in character development.I don't want to spoil anything, but this film manages to make the title character (exquisitely performed by Laia Costa) a fully developed, fascinating, strong, and convincing character even though we only meet her as strangers and witness her for a mere two-and-a-half hours. A stunning and unexpected scene early in the film, which provides her with her only backstory, adds a substantial amount of depth and weight to her character during the journey she then undergoes. Some critics have faulted the film for being ""unrealistic."" I can understand why some people would be skeptical about why Victoria would go along with what happens to her when she could rather easily back out, but I think the small amount of backstory she's given makes her arc fascinating. The movie is named after her because it's about her; she's not just some random everywoman roped into a bizarre experience. Rather, she's a very particular person whose personal history informs everything that happens in the film.As a sidenote, while this is literally a story about two and a half hours of literal action and happenings, I don't think I'd be stretching too much in my interpretation if I said this was also a more symbolic film about relationships in general. I might even go so far as to call it a romantic comedy in which the comedy tropes have been swapped for thriller tropes. (So, a ""romantic thriller,"" I guess? Yet not an ""erotic thriller"" like, say, BODY HEAT or BASIC INSTINCT.) Here we have all the emotions of an entire prolonged relationship--the meet cute, flirtatious humor, the excitement of getting to know someone, getting intimate, falling in love, learning darker secrets, having a falling out... I could go on, but I would start to enter spoiler territory. Suffice it to say, I think this is a movie that captures all of that in a single dawn while managing to pack in as much emotional weight as would be packaged into a much longer time frame in a more typical movie.I suppose you could say this is BEFORE SUNRISE if BEFORE SUNRISE had a few more rifle-wielding gangsters in it. And like that film, this is also an absolute must-see that will hopefully grow in estimation over time."
" Watch it for the scenery
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,1,"The street scenes are interesting ... that's about it. Sure the one-shot trick is cool but it doesn't salvage a terrible story.The character Victoria is the very personality that is so naive you will hate her in all film genres, massively serious stupid decisions one after another. It's just one of those films giving you a headache afterwards"
" An overhyped gimmick not worth your while
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,3,"The overall ratings and the success of this film is beyond my comprehension.Wether a movie is made in one take or not obviously doesn't say anything about the film. That being said the acting is at times great, the cinematography as well but it's impossible to feel anything for these naive imbecile characters.Not worth your time, honestly."
" A nice surprise
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,8,"Many reviewers make the terrible mistake of rating movies from their expectations. It's not the movies fault ig people have expectations from what they have heard. It also doesn't help the readers. I had never heard of Victoria - it just came up on TV - so I will review without prejudice.I started watching when a girl is in a night club, and it immediately became interested, because it felt so near, as if I was there, and that feeling created a suspension in me, refraining me from turning the TV off, although hadn't planned to watch anything. That suspension remained until the end, which is a terrific sign that there is something there that is good. I had no idea about the technique used, about one-take or improvisings, but I fell for the characters, being annoyed at Victorias bad choices. A very peculiar feeling.Watch it, without prejudice."
" Wonderful Film
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,9,"I was so amazed by this movie. The acting is all top notch, the story is fresh and so gripping and the scenes mesmerizing. It's as if no one is acting and you are following them around Berlin as a part of the cast in this gritty with class crime drama. Once or maybe twice a year a film like this gem comes along, so don't miss it."
" Boring
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,5,"I expected alot from this movie, especially because of the high rating, but the first hour was really boring; no interesting conversations, no action, no nice environments... After about an hour, more action came and it became more interesting, though I still don't understand the high rating."
" Visceral
",2019-03-12 00:00:00,9,"I'm what you would call a ""one-shot"" or a ""one-r"" nerd. I love seeing movies or TV shows go extended periods of time without cutting. More often than not, it elevates the scenes' tension and impact. Victoria on the other hand, literally presented its' entire runtime without blinking or cutting. Talk about an achievement, Victoria manages to turn what some would call a gimmick, into a brilliantly directed crime thriller. Taking place in Germany, a new local (Spanish woman named Victoria) finds herself caught up in a night full of drinking, dancing, and law-breaking. The lack of cutting gives Victoria a realistic edge and grounded tone that you may not find in your run of the mill crime-drama. But its'' authenticness is what drives this one home as a win all-around.9.0/10"
" Breathtaking race through the night
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,8,"Incredible one-take performance, particularly by the main actress. Great suspense, very touching drama. Wonderful immersion into the nightlife of a wild Berlin. Few days after watching, changed rating from 7 to 8 as the film still had its grip on me, very moving indeed."
" One of the best German movies
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,10,In my opinion this movie is great. It is fascinating that the movie is an one shot and i have the biggest respect for the actors.
" A wonderful surprise
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,10,"Many of the negative reviewers see the Victoria character as a sweet girl who would not get involved with four strange street guys on a mission she doesn't understand. I didn't find it so incredible. She has just had her life turned upside down, having failed in her classical music career. She is friendless in a foreign city, and she has no one until one night she is charmed by one of the four, Sonne. I thought the movie was extremely well done. I read background that they first filmed it in several ""takes,"" as insurance in case they couldn't get the one-take approach to work. First doing a several takes version did pay off, because the action in the final, single-take version stays smooth, and in fact drives forward at quite an accelerating pace. I was gripping my seat. The single take really puts you admidst the characters and the story. Out of nowhere, this film comes as a wonderful, thrilling surprise."
" Amazing! Top rate thriller
",2018-12-13 00:00:00,10,"An artist (the beautiful Laia Costa), after pouring her young existence into her instrument, learns at graduation that she didn't make it. She drifts to Berlin, where maybe she can learn the language and try life again. She takes a low-paying job at a coffee shop and makes clumsy attempts to meet people. One night, she's leaving a club, alone, at the same time the bouncers are ejecting four guys. They're losers, like her. But one guy is interested, and he's cute (Frederick Lau). His friends are nuts and slightly menacing, but she's drawn by their unaffected, street-rat antics. It's edgy fun until suddenly, things get scary serious -- the four friends urgently and desperately need help. And so begins ""Victoria,"" a fantastic thriller accomplished by a wonderful German team including director Sebastian Schipper (Deutscher Filmpreis 2015 for ""Victoria"") and cameraman Sturla Brandth Grovlen (Deutscher Filmpreis/Beste Kamera 2015 also for ""Victoria""). ""Victoria"" is filmed in one single, two-plus hour camera take -- one scene, no breaks. According to reviews, there was a storyboard but almost no script. By brilliant direction, great acting, and maybe some of the fortune that occasionally favors the brave, ""Victoria"" works -- incredibly well. This is an amazing accomplishment and cinema of the highest class-- easily the finest German film in the many years since ""Das Boot,"" ""Heimat,"" and ""Berlin Alexanderplatz."""
" Ingenious
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,8,Victoria. Ingenious real time set German film shot in one single take focused on a Spanish girl who gets mixed up with the wrong guys. Worth seeing for the achievement but very tense and involving in its own right. 8 out of ten
" It's called EDITING!
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,2,I have no idea why this movie won so many awards. It's painfully slow to the point that I fast forwarded through most of the painstaking scenes which detail Every. Single. Moment. The concept was interesting but there's no editing and it bored me to tears to the point I didn't actually care what happened to the characters.
" The Great movie, one shot
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,9,"I think that film Victoria is one of the few films in Europe which attracts attention from its beginning until the end, for reasons related to the style of the film (one shot). Secondly, it's a film about the youth crisis and the stage of the search for meaning in discovering a new life. Thirdly, it is the idea of the experience itself, which is what made Victoria go into the adventure in a criminal case that doesn't mean anything to her. but I believe that the essence it, it's the human good that has been shattered on the rock of positive law, that were originally produced by the institutions of power.
The story of the film is the story of Victoria, she is a young woman, in a strange city. She's trying to find a relationship for her loneliness, In the scene of entering the movie inside a nightclub, but she failed. Victoria meets a four guys in the street, everyone is deeply concerned and they try to hide it with fun.,and begins a story of the film.
In the end, everyone dies and Victoria stays alive.
The film tackled the whole community problem within Europe through a short story. that what we think is evil, is only another way of expressing the good that is inside us and the only social law that is neglected for human beings.
Victoria is a film of the quality of nervous tension, calm and emotion at the same time."
" Victoria - A Grand Success
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,8,"'Victoria (2015)' review'Victoria', where to begin? (Just a heads up before reading this review, this review was written as preparation to study film studies. I apologise if it is not up to standards but it is my first attempt). I hope you enjoy this spoiler-free review.
It's good to know that before we start, everything was filmed in a single-continuous shot with camera movements not smooth but made to feel like a home movie. To counteract this, most dialogue was improvised with only a short based script used as framework. The effect of this made the film feel like a live event to the viewer, with the action unfolding live and reactions/ actors movements and dialogue being very real and not forced. The first person effect of using only one shot, whilst able to create forms of motion sickness to few, also helps add to the very raw and real atmosphere.
The plot starts with a Spanish women, named Victoria' whom having recently moved to Berlin is experiencing Berlin's nightlife. The rowdy club atmosphere transforms into a rowdy street atmosphere as we follow Victoria around. She then meets a group of people, whom whilst with good motivations will unwillingly force Victoria into a night time trip she never would have dreamed of. Filmed in real time, as dusk turns to dawn, you can't help but become hooked as this high-adrenaline, well-paced climatic story ensues.
As previously mentioned the one-shot camera follows the title character, 'Victoria' played by the wonderful Laia Costa, a young café worker whom is not afraid to party by night, whilst willingly run a café by day. She soon meets a group of men, all friends. The most noticeable is 'Sonne', a man she soon becomes attached to, so much so they bond over everyday things like what drink you buy and such. The first 50 minutes or so focus mostly on the development of characters giving all screen time to Victoria and her bonding with characters: Sonne, Boxer, Fuss and Blinker. After the major event of the plot begins, the earlier character development helps you become immersed as people you feel you understand are now in trouble.
The film is not a fantasy of what could happen but a harsh reminder of what is happening. It covers many dark but also some light themes. The main seems to be romance, friendship, peer-pressure and violence. As previously mentioned the main event does not start really until about the 50th minute. This does mean you should skip to this point. The build-up to the events are just as vital in expressing the themes. Sprinkled with foreshadowing the climax feels very much more engaging with each theme being interlaced. 
A running time of 138 minutes might seem long, but as the film progresses you won't be counting down the time till it ends. Regardless the first 50 minutes doesn't contain any major action. To quote a fellow viewer ""Wake me up when something happens""! This response was soon counteracted as the second part of the film became a well-paced action. The further use of foreshadowing made all that happened the more bitter sweet. Lighting in the film is harsh, especially in the nightlife rush, maybe to represent the harsh reality of how high or low a person can go. The film also has a very complimentary sound track. Uniquely selected, hectic at parts and monotone at others. One noticeable deliberate, yet impressive use of music was during a scene at a night club, with inside the club this music being very calming (the complete opposite of what you would expect; maybe to exaggerate the surreal feeling of the characters at that point. The various instrumental moments in the film allow the musical score to tell the story also. Finally the setting of the streets of Berlin fit well with the overall feel. The sharp and harsh straight uniformed and rectangular streets contrast well with the warmth of other sets: the roof, the café and hotel.
Overall it is clear to see why 'Victoria' won 18 awards when original released. From the complimentary soundtrack to the direct themes, abrupt plot and the very real and raw camera movements, making you feel one with the characters, like you're really there, my view is 'Victoria' is a great success, a theatrical masterpiece. I completely recommend the view as a result but would add to view with subtitles. They are not distracting and do not ruin the atmosphere whilst viewing but do help build setting, especially when the realistic sounds can muffle the odd voice, yet don't worry all main dialogue is heard and made clear. Finally 'Victoria' is very immersive, so I suggest for the best viewing experience, watch in the dark without constantly stopping/starting to go to the toilet.
Thanks for reading :)

" long night's journey into day
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,10,"Sometimes, in the middle of the desert, one encounters a green, luxurious, exuberant oasis, full of life and beauty. This is exactly my feeling after having viewed 'Victoria' in this summer cinematographic season which seems drier and duller and dummer than any other that I remember. After so many brainless action movies, and huge stars playing flat roles in boring comedies, here comes a film which is a wonderful combination of action and human feelings, of wonderful acting and cinematographic excellencies. Some of the reviews that I have read use the word 'masterpiece'. This is far from being an exaggeration.'Victoria', co-written and director by Sebastian Schipper who is better known as an actor, takes places in real-time, late at night and early in the morning, in Berlin, the German capital, in 2015. The feeling of reality is brightly transmitted to viewers by making the film with one shot, more than two hours of cinema filmed with hand-held camera, all the time close to the heroes of the film. Their lives change forever during these 140 minutes. It visibly took a huge effort to prepare the whole filming which takes us in different places, streets, shops, night clubs, building and roofs in Berlin. The result is spectacular.It's a movie about loneliness, friendship and love, about youth, searching a meaning in life and failing. The heroes are a young Spanish girl, ex-musician, living in the cosmopolitan capital of Germany without speaking German who meets a group of fringe youth from East Berlin. As the action develops the characters will know each other, will fall in love, will get into trouble, and their destinies will change. Acting is also superb, with the Spanish actress Laia Costa in the lead role, and the German actors Frederick Lau and Franz Rogowski. Far from being just a gimmick, the technical achievement of this film is fully justified and fits well the story and the action. Berlin at the hours of deep night and uncertain dawn looks more interesting than I have ever seen it since 'Der Himmel über Berlin'. This is German cinema at its best."
" An Excellent,Thrilling And Entertaining Thriller
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,9,"Victoria takes drama to a completely new level. It's Incredibly intense, very intimate thriller. A Stunning movie I won't forget."
" Much more than one shot.
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,10,"The 'thing' about this film is the one continuous shot. Which is a shame in many ways as it's got much more going for it than that. It's wonderful! The camerawork is effortless, it melts in and flows with the scene, putting the viewer at the heart of the film. Cameraman Sturla Brandth Grøvlen deserves a huge shout out. It helps that the plot unfolds beautifully, slowly introducing the cast, their story, their building relationships. There's menace, tenderness and intrigue woven into a 2 hour rollercoaster. It's very intimate with several great performances, the most staggering from Laia Costa and in short the entire thing is bloody fantastic! and yeah it's one shot, no cuts, which on top of everything else makes this very special."
" Spectacularly ordinary ""real-time"" movie with so little to say...
",2018-03-31 00:00:00,1,"What is it with the 77 % review/critic rating - is it ""rent-a-crowd"" or ""rent-a-critic""?OK, so well-crafted American movies which compress time so viewers do not spent their precious time watching boring bits of ordinary life (as they do all the way through ""Victoria"") are passe and banal, but this???Almost the first hour of this 138 min movie could be compressed into maybe 10 minutes without losing much of the ""essential movie"". At a party pretty Victoria joins up with a bunch of guys who are such losers they cannot even figure out the car they want to steal is unlocked. They commit petty theft at a convenience store where the elderly attendant is asleep. The others go off and Victoria and Sonne open the bar where she gets paid 4 Euros an hour + tips, though no one comes in. She plays the piano which provides a welcome few minutes of relief from the crushing boredom.About the one hour mark the others return and take Victoria and Sonne off to meet some thug - and his half a dozen henchmen - who hands out handguns and wants them to rob a bank of a known 50,000 Euro. They do this successfully but soon heavily armed cops are hunting them down in force. In the firefight, a couple of them are fatally shot. Sonne is badly wounded. Victoria & Sonne hole up in an apartment block and ""borrow"" a baby so they can escape. Strangely, just before hailing a cab to go to a hotel, they ditch the baby - nothing is said in the movie, but it seems to have been dumped on the street somewhere - and go to a very expensive hotel. No check-in (or for that matter, other guests or attendants - very strange..) are seen but they enter a room without problems.Sonne refuses to go to hospital and soon dies. A tearful Victoria flees the hotel to wander the street, and that's how the movie ends. Hardly a masterpiece..."
" Here's Why I Wouldn't Recommend It To Most People
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,7,"Victoria is a successful experiment! As with every experiment, describing the movie falls short of experiencing it. However, experiencing it, stresses its unconventional nature, possibly making it uninteresting for some viewers. Upon closer inspection, it gets clear that the underlying motivation was primarily on the technical aspects, and as the movie progresses less on the characters and on the plot. After all, the viewer marvels at how the scenes were shot, which means the clear focus lies on how the movie's production works - and not so much on the plot and on the characterization. Technically speaking, this movie achieved everything it was intended to do and as the movie is one of two feature films shot in this way, it is a required viewing for people interested in filmmaking.Overall 7/10

" The visual embodiment of a flashy car which is slower than a bike
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,2,"If you are one of those stay at home parents who can sit in their living room and watch life just wisp by then this is the film for you. However, if you are one of those people who expect a film to have an interesting plot, characters and overall look, this film has already failed you. Remember as a child when you and your friends would make short little clips and videos with fun stories and ideas. Far too young to be able to edit, you would end up with one long continuous shot without cuts but still plenty of charisma. Well, Victoria boosts the former and lacks the latter. Victoria, technically, I guess is pretty impressive with a 2 hour run time all in one shot which proves how far film has come digitally.v However, in doing this the director has to sacrifice a lot of useful story techniques such as flashbacks and stories which play out over a long period of time. This is the downfall of Victoria as it attempts to relate us to a character in the space of 2 hours which the majority of, from memory, is spent running around. It seems the film is perfect for the artsy fartsy film director who wishes to experience ""real film"" but for the everyday viewer it is more than alienating. With unrelatable characters, a lack of unique plot and a heavy reliance on a not so fancy film technique, Victoria is not worth a watch."
" Great logistics, terrible story.
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,4,Read the title. (Why does review length even matter?)
" Victoria
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,8,"I am feeling the need to write something about this film. In terms of cinematography, there are three basic elements that make this feauture quite brilliant. First of all, the movie is at least two hours long, making it almost impossible to shoot with one take. Unbelievably, with numerous changing locations and the camera following the main characters all the time, director achieves it. He certainly creates a chilling and fiery atmosphere while we get to know Victoria, Sonne, Boxer, Blinker and Fuß. We are with them along their journey between everyday life and their dramatic ""adventures"" and that feeling emanates from camera on hand and long take troughout the whole film. It also results from the amazingly naturalistic way of their conversations -sometimes German, sometimes English- and their way of getting to know each other, their way of having fun walking in the streets of Berlin at night time. The realistic and improvisational dialogue between Victoria and her new German friends, creates the proper ground for the viewer to be absorbed by this massive story. Lastly, I strongly believe that these exact series of events -the first meeting, the connection and the unfair ending of this relationship- is something real, something that can happen, under certain circumstances. Victoria is a simple story about one night in Berlin and the day after. However, the way that this story becomes so real, so intense, so significant is because the plot is so well-put together. We let ourselves travel with Victoria, have fun and take the most difficult decisions about our -and her- survival."
" Stellar!
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,10,"Wow took me almost three years to stumble onto this morsel. I googled 'best movies in Netflix you haben't seen'. It has been a very long time since I saw a truly remarkable movie. This is a must see and officially one of the greatest movie experiences in my time.Those reviewers who think Victoria's choice to go hang with these four strange dudes was unbelievable completely missed the essence of who she is. I mean I thought the same thing at first so I get that.But here it is...Victoria starts the film alone at a club w/ no friends. She hits on the bartender. No luck there so she takes her shot and leaves. She claims she has no friends. She is clearly lonely. You see it pour out if her when she plays the piano and breaks down conveying her dedication to her craft wasn't without sacrifice: a sensen of community.And so she begins the film alone, finds a taste of community she never really had with these four dudes... and ends up alone.Aside from this being a monumental technical avhievement, it is quite simply the reason I fell in love with movies in the first place. It's very difficult to 'wow' me these days so congrats to these fine film makers.Enjoy!"
" Superb
",2017-12-07 00:00:00,10,"This is my first review here. This is what cinema is. This is true masterpiece! This is art. Can't recommend more! Don't ever doubt if this is worth your time. Simply sit down and watch it. It will blow you away. Acting is pure class and the movie rhythm, music and directing is superb."
" Victoria
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,7,"When I got the latest copy of the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, this German film was one of the latest entries, I found out it is one of the few films (like Timecode or Russian Ark) that was created in one single shot, so I was really looking forward to it. Basically Spanish girl Victoria (Laia Costa) moved to Berlin, Germany three months ago, she works in a cafe on a meagre wage, she does not know anyone in the city, and she does not speak much German, the only common language around her is English. One night, at around 4 o'clock in the morning, Victoria leaves a club, after enjoying drinking and dancing, she meets four young men who were rejected entry, they are ""Sonne"" (Frederick Lau), ""Boxer"" (Franz Rogowski), ""Blinker"" (Burak Yigit), and ""Fuß"" (Max Mauff). The men invite Victoria to walk through the city, she agrees, after the men steal alcohol from an all night shop, they all go onto the roof of an apartment building, where they drink and smoke marijuana together. Victoria says she needs to leave to open the cafe she works at in a short time, Sonne has been flirting with her since they met, he suggests accompanying her, she agrees, Boxer tells Sonne to return soon, it is implied the four men have something important to do this night. Victoria and Sonne arrive at the cafe, the two are alone inside, Sonne notices a piano and tinkles on it, he dares Victoria to play something, she masterfully plays one of the Mephisto Waltzes, Sonne is impressed and deeply moved, she tells that she had dreams of becoming a concert pianist, but at music school she was told was not good enough to continue. Shortly later, Boxer arrives extremely nervous and agitated, he demands Sonne leave with him immediately, the four men steal a car at the front of the cafe and drive away, only to return moments later, because Fuß is highly intoxicated and has fallen unconscious. A desperate Boxer demands Sonne to ask Victoria to replace Fuß and help them, Sonne reluctantly does so, he tells Victoria that Boxer was helped by gangster Andi (André Hennicke) while in prison. Now Andi demands Boxer pay him back, Andi has asked Boxer to get three allies for a meeting, none of the four men know the purpose of it, Sonne is surprised when Victoria immediately agrees to help, Victoria drives Sonne, Boxer, Blinker and Fuß (lying in the back of the car) to the meeting place, a parking garage. There Andi, surrounded by several armed men, demands that the four rob a certain bank this morning for 50,000, Andi will take 10.000 as payback, leaving them with the rest, the four agree to the robbery when Victoria is threatened, they are armed with guns, and forced to take drugs to make them more alert and aggressive. Blinker has a panic attack while Victoria is driving, but the others calm him down, Boxer feels guilty for involving Victoria and say he will rob the bank alone, but the others, including Victoria, tell him they will still help, the robbery goes smoothly, although the car stalls, it is left in a back alley. The four escape, euphoric after the successful robbery and still under the influence of the drugs, they return to the club to celebrate, Sonne and Victoria share a kiss, but they are thrown out when Blinker and Boxer strip naked on the dance floor. Outside, they remember has been left unconscious Fuß back in the car, returning to the back alley they find the police have already found it, they panic and try to leave, but police in plain clothes spot them. Boxer, Blinker and Sonne draw their guns and a shootout ensues, Blinker is hot and left by the other three, Boxer implores Sonne and Victoria to take the money and flee while he confronts the police. Sonne and Victoria manage to enter an apartment building unseen, they enter one of the apartments and take a young couple hostage, they take a change of clothes, the couple have a baby, they take it with them, Victoria promises the crying mother her child will be left somewhere for her to find, she and Sonne encounter the police on the staircase, assumed to be a young couple they are allowed to leave the building. They leave the baby in front of a café across the street and get a taxi to a nearby hotel, Victoria reserves a room while Sonne waits, writhing in great pain, on their room Victoria notices Sonne has been shot, once in the room he lies down in the bed. Sonne watches the news, it shows that Boxer died during the shootout, and Blinker died being taken to hospital, Victoria sees Sonne is bleeding profusely and calls an ambulance, but Sonne dies, Victoria breaks down crying, eventually she pulls herself together, takes the bag of cash and walks out of the hotel. Costa gives a great performance as the young Spaniard drawn into a bank job filled with numerous consequences, Lau is equally good as the man she fancies, the chemistry between them works well, it makes us care about them during the chaotic stuff, the techniques to keep the camera in one single shot (it took three attempts to complete it), going many places across the city, are remarkable, it really is a captivating drama. Very good!"
" A good film kind of harmed by it's technical gimmick
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,8,"A young Spanish woman living in Berlin meets some German guys while leaving a dance club leading to an all-night odyssey culminating in crime and violence. The gimmick here is that the entire movie was shot in one continuous take. It's an amazing accomplishment given the variety of settings and the extended action climax, but one that works against the film quite often. There's, by necessity, a lot of scenes of the characters travelling and they tend to improvise repetitive dialogue during the downtime. It drags down the momentum of a film that should be about mounting tension. It's still a mostly good film that's a masterful technical achievement."
" A journey to self-destruction.
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,8,"Probably, just probably, the most depressive movie of all time. This movie could have two different reviews and it all depends in the moment and place you decide to view this one. Isn't the same if you see this movie in a cinema with a lot of people talking and not paying attention on the movie, with babies crying, with two people kissing each other and making jokes in the front row that seeing these masterpiece alone at your house, in the night and thinking about life. Things change quickly and the environment affect your opinion about a movie. I see these movie when I was making so many important decisions for my future and I never felt so powerless seeing a movie since probably ""Nocturnal Animals"". I only recommend these movie to you if you're in the mood for a depressive movie and have the guts to hold on all the damage the characters of ""Victoria"" do to themselves. And I need to admit,I'm not to fan of movies where the lead role falls in a woman, but Laia Costa deserve more nominations to academy awards, she truly put the rod high for future German movies try to overcome these European gem."
" Stunning
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,10,"For the two plus hours of one perfect, seamless camera follow of this film's titular character alone, this is simply an amazing feat. But this is also a post-modern Shakespearean experience with its tumultuous highs and lows and the most moving nuanced portrayal of two strangers finding one another and falling in love I believe I have ever seen in film and usually cinematic romance bores me to tears. But this goes beyond romance; you enter the lives of this pair and the troupe of which they are a part and you cannot help but empathise with them in their their elation, their fear, frustration, relief, craziness, tenderness, desire and pain over the course of a new day breaking as the group becomes deeply embroiled in a criminal act circumstance somewhat forces upon them. The acting and character development are also brilliant. And I wonder how much of it was ad-libbed to a basic plot and script, because I just don't know if this kind of natural and realistic dialogue and character interaction could result from heavy planning.I really loved this film. It really is a masterpiece (I thought such comments might have been made by friends of the film's creators initially, before viewing) It will be one to stay with me and I will also be looking out for other films by these writers and/or with these actors in them."
" Victoria is a movie about the fact that is was shot in one take.
",2017-06-15 00:00:00,2,"Victoria is a movie about the fact that is was shot in one take. This movie is about itself.That is what this movie is about. That is the subject matter. It is not a movie about a Spanish girl living in Berlin, about being estranged in modern modern city life, it is not about Berlin, not about making choices, it is not about life, death, conscience, it is about nothing, nothing other than; the fact that is was shot in one take.It gets five stars in major newspapers, for, as is the case with most films these days; it blows a screen of action and tension, the smoke being a decoy for substance.I remember this space movie with Sandra Bullock, Gravity; that was also supposedly a brilliant movie, since it was made with special techniques. But it was empty all the way through, and people fall for this stuff. This movie is the same thing.Characters are flat as can be, not well written, and the so called slow scenes on poetic music are not telling anything at all. For example: at a certain point our characters are in an elevator and all the dialogue, up to this point very dominant, is turned down to silence; we just see them talking and laughing, as nice music comes up and images seem to slow down. It is supposed to be telling of something, or to be dramatic. What is this telling us? Nothing. That is because there is no drama what so ever, that is accentuated here. It is simply hollow aesthetics.It would be so cool if this was a great movie. Because then the makers would have had their revenge over mainstream cinema, which they were trying to rebel against. A beautiful goal, full of heart and energy - but if the result is a flat movie, obsessed with form and without any substance what so ever, like in Gravity, then what do you have to show for? Where is this an argument for? You only prove yourself wrong, is what you do, and as we say in Holland; you throw in you own windows.I guess the process was exhilarating, which is a good reason to make anything of course.But if you want to watch a movie that is not about itself, and will be dear to you for years to come, because you love the characters, their struggle, their mannerisms, their pain and courage, then don't bother with this.If you want some kind of thriller, then go for it."
" Pretty basic night out in Germany movie that turns into a disaster. Never drink when u go out
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,4,"I have watched 3 movies this weekend. Namely Toni Erdmann, Alaska and this one. Just to be fair I am native speaking German and I get the humor from Germany and felt sort ""comfortable"" watching the night out with a lot of funny jokes at the beginning. Just to put it clear, no American girl would have even talked to these 4 guys to begin with, so she definitely had some issues going on. Next, it think the filming is done very basic with few close shots or or tricks that make a movie more watchable. It is kinda entertaining to the point where the guys are ""sort of"" forced to Rob a bank. Anyone who knows Germany knows that the cops are pretty good and if you're going dancing into an club after robbing a bank you probably get caught. It seems pretty basic starting from the story plot to the execution. A Hollywood movie would have been able to summarize this night out in 30 minutes. Nothing against German filmmaking, but if you watch Toni Erdmann you see some more sophisticated stuff going on"
" A Huge Victory in Victoria
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,10,"THE film of 2015 and possibly of this decade. I urgently put this on my films to watch as soon as I discovered it and I'm really glad I stumbled upon it late one night perusing IMDb. Sebastian Schipper directs a monumental project of a film done in one take. One friggin' take. I understand this has been done before once or twice, but it is assuredly a rare feat. Victoria was recommended to me a few times, and I did not take long to track it down and finally watch it on Netflix. It left me in awe. I sat staring at the TV screen unable to move and silent minutes after the final moments were upon the screen. The film is tremendously raw, and because of the continuous take technique, the viewer feels like part of the crew. The real-time lapse is incredibly effective and becomes a tone- setter early on.The first 40 minutes is a bit of a slow-burn setting up the characters and getting the viewer attached to the lead, Victoria. If one does not know the plot, I can guarantee that they will be in for quite the shock as the slow-burn turns realistically frightening, as the viewer begins to wonder what this young woman will do with the situation presented to her. The most interesting part of the film is possibly the spontaneity of Victoria and what exactly draws her to these ""real Berlin guys"". Is she just a thrill- seeker? Is she simply loyal? Does she like Sonne? Her character unfurls greatly during intimate moments on her night out on the town, and we watch her change mightily as we see parts of the climax truly effect her and change her.The cast is all fantastic lead by a truly tremendous and no holds barred tour-de-force performance by the stunning Laia Costa. I would dare put her performance in the same category as what I consider the ""Masterclass"": Burt Lancaster in Elmer Gantry, Peter Sellers in Dr. Strangelove, Dennis Hopper in Blue Velvet, Colin Firth in Apartment Zero, Kate Winslet in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Daniel-Day Lewis in There Will Be Blood, and Joaquin Phoenix in The Master. The masterpiece of 2015 and possibly the masterpiece of this decade."
" Absolute must
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,8,"Clearly one of the best movies ever made. Brilliant script - moreover so since it left room to so much improvisation - and a very addictive rhythm. For the entire 138 minutes I was immersed in the story, excited and scared and unleashed and high and crazy. It's a liberating story that adds a layer of soft nuances to your usual Clockwork Orange type of story. Super trippy, fabulous acting, great script. And the fact that it's shot in one take makes it quite a rare gem. Absolute must."
" Many reasons why this is a masterpiece, except the plot
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,8,"This movie was a genuinely hard one for me to decide on my opinion for, because it was by far one of the best movies I've ever come across, in terms of cinematography and style. And it wasn't the ""one-take"" part that impressed me the most (although it was part of it), but all of the other touches that went with it. For example, most releases tend not to include subtitles for what the German-speaking people are saying, which means that, unless you can speak the language yourself (I can't), then you're basically in the same place as young Victoria. You have no idea what's going on, what everyone else is saying, and, in turn, no idea what's about to happen until it happens.Then there was the seamlessness of the filming combined with the overall chaos of the film; first off, the dialogue is stilted and quite difficult to follow, and not just because of the language barrier - they're talking naturally, and most of what they're saying is improvised. It almost feels like you're there with them, trying to follow a rowdy conversation that you cannot quite remember how it started. And then there's the fact that, occasionally, someone will make a mistake, which ranges from the not-so-serious (Fredrick Lau accidentally dropping the cigarette that was handed to him and making up for it by getting all sullen) to the almost fatal (that part where Laia Costa accidentally took the wrong turning and almost drove right into a crowd of camera crew, prompting panic in the car and her to start cursing in Spanish). It was things like that that made the one-take style so effective. And it was what drew me to the film.However, as mentioned in the title, it was not without its flaws. And the pretty big one was the plot of the film. Let me be fair; it was the second half I'm complaining about. In the beginning, when it was just a Spanish girl, alone, with a low-paying job she has to go to in a couple of hours, following the rowdy group of German guys that she can barely understand through the streets of Berlin and getting on so well with them was just beautiful. Because I've been there. It felt relatable. But the second half didn't just feel awfully contrived. It was awfully contrived. It suddenly lost all sense of realism and felt like we were drifting from a perfectly fantastic story into a cliché-ridden, rubbish version of a heist movie. I genuinely found myself wishing that we could go back to the epilepsy-inducing strobe lights of the nightclub that I could barely watch at the beginning.That said, it was still a great movie. And I'd particularly like to highlight Laia Costa's performance. She was definitely the stand-out of the film, and by far my favourite. Especially the way she ended the film. And, if I may, she has such an amazing smile."
" Beating along like techno.
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,9,"Astounding film from start to finish.The best way I can describe it is like watching a genuinely beautiful women for two hours (not in reference to Laia Costa though you can't help but do this). What I mean is, there is a real honesty and truth to this type of story telling, it's raw, uncut (literally) and progressing unpredictably along to its own melodic beat. The film begins with a pretty dark techno track, which I think is quite symbolic and a reference for the next two hours. You won't be able to take your eyes off it. Strangely had a similar vibe to Under the Skin.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1441395/Enjoy."
" Superbly crafted film
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,10,"I saw someone had described it as a masterpiece and I wouldn't disagree. I watched it with subtitles but it isn't an issue as it would work in silence in terms of understanding the story line. It begins by making you fear the worst could happen to the young girl who meets a seemingly motley group of men late at night. However it takes a different course and moves at an incredible pace It is shot in a way so that it appears to be one continuous shot from start to finish. This in itself is quite a feat. The unpredictability of the film and the tangents it shoots off at keep you on the edge of your seat. The characterizations are strong and you care what happens to them which also matters so much in any film. The story line has been covered by others I am sure and its probably best not to know too much about that aspect or you could undermine the tension created. If only there were more films of this caliber rather than Hollywood trash like La La Land, which is badly made, crafted and predictable- all characteristics not shared by this film!"
" A really good movie killed by a stupid plot
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,4,"Victoria is somewhat sad. The movie itself is a good indie flick. Its very unique with its single-shot and real-time setting. Its starts out a little slow, but really builds up suspense. Its a bit lo-fi, but by design. The actors are also great, scenery in the club and the garage is amazing. But ... the plot.I am not talking about a weak story or plot holes. The main plot is that four guys rob a bank without any preparation whatsoever and instead go to a nightclub before and get drunk. This is obviously a very thin plot to start with, but thats not the problem. The problem is weird things where you as a viewer just loose touch with the movie.It starts out with Victoria going with the four boys who are very obviously up to no good. But the movie gets back on its feet. She is a bit drunk, a bit crazy and also very lonely. She likes the guy and it all makes sense again. That ends when she gets in the car! Why get in a stolen(!) car with people you don't know(!) when you are drunk(!), going to something obviously criminal(!) when you actually have to go to work(!)? Why make the story so extreme that a normal viewer cant feel for the main character at all? Anyways, she drives them into a garage where she sees a guy with a gun and realizes what she got into. The viewer can feel her being trapped, scared and the suspense of the movie is back. But than when they leave the garage the boys tell her to leave, but she says she wants to stay, very calm and determined, no explanation. All the suspense and feeling of being trapped is suddenly replaced by ""WHAT?! WHY?!"" That is not a traditional plot hole. The movie could have forced her to stay in the car or simply skipped the whole issue all together, no problem. But the movie deliberately takes the time to make her say this ridiculous sentence. A few things can be explained by the chaotic situation, them being drunk and well ... idiots, but even taking that into account there is still a whole lot of ""WHY?!""... - after you rob a bank, why park only a couple blocks away? - why then stay right next to the car? - why stay in a group of four? - why go to a night club with guns and 50k in cash? - why go back to the car afterwards? - when you can escape a gun fight with the police why take a taxi right next to it and pay the taxi driver 100 and then actually stay where he takes you? As soon as he hears the news, he will connect the dots. - Even the last scene is ruined... Leaving the dead guy in the room and just casually walking away with the money after an extreme night... OK, good ending! But why the f would you leave the door to the room with the dead guy open and what happened to the ambulance that was called like ten minutes earlier? It makes 0 sense. Why does the movie take the time to call the ambulance if its just gonna turn into plot hole? Just leave it out all together then...I don't expect a perfect story, but there are just so many ""WTF?!""-moments, that it kills the movie. Of course you gonna die if you return to the getaway car that you parked just a couple of blocks away from the bank..."
" Two fingers up to Hollywood blockbusters
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,9,"This spellbinding trip through Berlin youth culture is a masterful achievement for the production team who filmed this all in one take. This ambitious technique didn't compromise the power of the visuals or the scale of the set. Despite my trained eye, the narrative was so strong that I wouldn't have noticed there weren't any cuts. Like Berlin's character itself, this effortless artistry symbolises two fingers up to the Hollywood blockbusters that need 100 takes to perfect just 1 second of film. The story follows a young woman who makes a series of decisions that go against the natural instinct of every other woman watching. When we would say no to a group of thugs in a dark side street, she says yes. This sets up the premise for the film as the story spirals more and more out of control. Through the development of a tender relationship between her and the male lead, the onion layers fall away and the audience can deduce why she is so reckless and self-destructive. It is this psychology that gives the story permission to escalate and become so separate from anything you or I would do. Don't watch the trailer, don't know anything about it before you watch it and you will be amazed."
" Great story but needed ruthless editing
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,5,"This film had the potential to be one of the great ones if only someone had displayed the nous and courage to slash about 20 minutes from the first half.As I watched the film at home I kept shouting. ""Okay, guys, we've got the message, now move along to the next step in the story."" But my shouts were in total vain and there came several points in the first half where I came within a whisker of giving up on it and finding something else more enjoyable to watch. It wasn't until we got to the first cafe scene that the story began to take off -- as take of it most certainly did.Perhaps the problem for the director and the editors lay in the fact that much of it was a single, protracted shot. But they should have seen the need to delete some of the more repetitive sections."
