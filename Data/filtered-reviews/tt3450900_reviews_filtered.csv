" Negative Reviews
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,10,A couple of the negative Reviews.....??? Go watch a Rambo movie. This was an excellent story
" See for yourself!
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,10,"I'm don't understand why this film was booed at Cannes, or anywhere. Skilled writing, directing and acting. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Thank you for making it. ðŸ’œ"
" WORST MOVIE EVER MADE
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,1,"This movie is absolutely terrible, avoid it all costs, terrible direction and even worse acting,seriously don't watch it."
" Surprisingly great !
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,9,"I got interested in Sea of Trees after reading it was much disliked in Cannes Movie Festival. But everybody knows that people going to Cannes know nothing about cinema.
So, really a good choice, simple but great story, perfect photo, scenery details, Matthew great acting as usual, very moving. Only one thing missing : a good soundtrack.
Thanks Gus !"
" Pretty Good
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,6,"What is the deal with Amzon Prime Video? They date most films at 2020 when they ate much older. Its a bait-and-switch problem for anyone who rents (or buys) a digital film. This movie was released in 2015. However, its dated 2020. The same is true for so many others. Take Stanley Kubricks brilliant film ""Full Metal Jacket"", released in 1987. Its set during the Vietnam War Prime Video dates it 2020. This is wrong. They do it a lot with more recent films. They change the release date to 1 (or sometimes 2) years ""newer"". It stinks!"
" Run, Forest, Run
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,5,"This gorgeous film does have its moments, good acting, great cinematography and a touching finale...but...predicable as all Hades. I knew almost instantly what the twist would be, not to mention the 2nd, flashback twist too. But, that's not to say this isn't worth watching. It may help you appreciate life more and your loved ones even more. Also, can't go wrong with the beautiful Ken Watanabe and great acting of Matthew McConaughey and Naomi Watts."
" Excellent film
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,10,I saw this in 2020 for the 1st time and it is certainly very well made. In these turbulent and perplexing times this is definitely a gem. I'm glad I watched it in 2020 rather than 5 years ago.
" Life Is Not an Action Movie
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,10,"""Thank you for taking care of me.""I will never understand why this movie was so disliked by critics.I am watching it for probably the third or fourth time and I am still deeply moved by the story. Yes, it is slow paced; yes, the story is non-linear. I stuck it out past the initial ""same old first world problems"" parts because I was curious about the whole ""sea of trees"" (Aokigahara Forest) mythos, that I did not previously know about. But, as I watched the story unfold, I wanted to know the why, and I was hooked. What the story says about life, love, relationships, guilt, survival and the human condition and spirit resonates and shines through if you are patient, listen and stay until the end.Finally, it is beautifully filmed, and masterfully directed and acted."
" Very weak story from the start
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,4,"A college professor, tired of his life, travels to the forest of Aokigahara, Japan, to end his life. The focal point of the film is, supposedly, depression and, as a consequence, suicide, but it quickly deviates from the focus when it starts to enter a narrative that is too melodramatic and boring.Right in the first act, you almost immediately understand how the story will unfold at the end, due to the predictability that Van Sant placed in the film, with too many coincidences, regret and the consequent redemption, the journey until he returns to the path to leave the forest and McConaughey's faithful ""Talking Cricket"" character, so lame and obvious.The guy that gave us 'Good Will Hunting' and 'Milk' is also capable of making a mess like this film."
" Recent heartfelt loss? This is for you.
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,9,"Timing matters.
If you've had a recent life-altering change, such as heart-ache loss of a close loved one, this is for you.
I lost a job of over 25 years a few days before finally watching this. Probably I needed to lose that ""job"" to finally have the time for this, as it's been on my watchlist for years. I hear such is psychologically similar to the loss of an immediate loved one.Many including me, may also have other unresolved grievances best revisited.Main character actors performances are beacons of light. Perfectly cast, well done.Sea of Trees has helped me to regain my posture, and resume living mindfully. A reminder of the importance of presence, awareness, and what matters."
" Tedious. Tiresome & Tragic
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,5,I read all the glowing reviews and wondered what film they were watching? - This is a sad movie without any entertaining value - The flashback scenes were flimsy and not convincing - The struggle scenes in the forest were boring and tedious - But the elephant in the room was trying to make a film about suicide - Tip my hat for the effort - But compare McConaughey's dazzling performance in Dallas Buyer's Club to this lame one - You'll thank me for avoiding this waste of time.
" Slow to get going but worth it in the end
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,6,"Matthew McConaughey is a depressed American businessman who makes a pilgrimage to Aokigahara, Japan's notorious ""suicide forest"" with intentions to kill himself. Initially we don't know why MMc is so depressed, what happened? Flashbacks are shown throughout so that the story gradually evolves.This was slow to get going and also depressing (which I'd expected) but its also pretty dry, so much so that I almost shut it off. Loads of beautiful filmography of the Japanese forest, it looks haunted, creepy, dark, moss covers everything, thick tress, shoes and random mementos. MMc definitely has a plan on how to die which gets delayed when a random, groaning Ken Watanabe shows up and staggers about. The two men team up, get lost, fall down cliffs and into freezing water, talk about life and such. This is where the movie picks up and turns into a mystery and survival story as the men try to get out of suicide forest.The ending is great, ties everything together, gives a bit of hope and solves the mystery -you will probably figure it out beforehand though. So ultimately a bit of a grind to begin but worth it in the end. I would watch this again."
" The Sea Of Trees
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,2,"The Sea Of Trees is a film directed by Gus Van Sant that stars Matthew McConaughey, Ken Watanabe and Naomi Watts and tells the story of a man traveling to Japan's Aokigahara Forest and meets a man wandering through the woods and offers to help him. Going into this film I had been riding a red hot streak with A24 having seen ""Uncut Gems"" and ""Good Time"" and awarding both perfect ratings, largely due not only to their technical aspects but also consistent storytelling and wonderful messages. A24's best content is known for a commitment to excellence with no stone left unturned in the filmmaking process, no matter how small. This among many reasons is why ""The Sea Of Trees"" left me incredibly disappointed and confused. The film goes through three incredibly jarring tonal shifts and contains plot twists that are more predictable than who will live in die in Disney films. Let's start with those tonal shifts shall we? The first act is very bleak and depressing as Arthur, the main character played by McConaughey, wanders into these woods and attempts to take his own life and wanders upon another traveler and offers to help him. Now I'm not gonna spoil this film for you but I guarantee that the moment you see this traveler, played by Watanabe, you know exactly what purpose he serves the plot and what plot twists he contains. The second acts changes the film from a survival, mystery film into an emotional drama with plot details revealed through flashbacks, the best method of storytelling. Fans of Rick and Morty will know exactly what I'm talking about when I say that this story should've started where it began and at no point travelled back to the past to explain the characters. Now of course that would remove Naomi Watts character from the film who I don't even remember the name of but literally her character was a device used by the plot just to develop Arthur as a character. Her acting along with Watanabe and even McConaughey's was dull. I like all three actors in other films but really all three characters offered the same notes. Watanabe was dramatic and hopeful, McConaughey was a cynic and an eventual believer and Watts was just a depressed alcoholic. It made no sense for McConaughey and Watts to stay together in the film either as their interactions were soley just The two of them insulting one another. Arthur goes from stern to apologetic in five seconds flat and his character gets a bunch of information out of Watanabe that makes no sense when you consider the film's major plot twist. The film started off with wordless storytelling and I love when a film can tell a story with visuals as opposed to an exposition dump through dialogue, it is much less annoying that way and in a sense the audience feels a lot less like you're being talked down upon. However the second and third acts are just littered with loads of expositional dialogue and flashbacks which didn't connect well with what the first act did. Also the payoff aspect of the film in which the protagonist fully develops as a character took place in the end of the second act and it showed. There were four different points throughout the third act but the film just kept going on and on and it started to annoy me. This film felt so goddamn long and I think about fifteen minutes of runtime could have been shaved off here. Speaking of that third act by the way the tone changed again toward a supernatural element to the drama and that scrambled the whole film up even more. This film could've been very effective if it had stuck to that visual storytelling of the first act and stuck to a single tone but it didn't, this film is three different movies crammed into one film. I feel like this film tried to make too deep a statement and perhaps a much deeper one than needed to be stated. I will say that the film looked absolutely beautiful but that's literally just about all I can say positively that's really notable. The music was mellowdramatic but it was okay, not amazing though. The film at least managed to capture the Forrest beautifully whether that be at night during a rainstorm, during the day with petals flying through the air or just during the noon with characters lying on the grass. Aside from those visuals though, there's no reason to watch this one. It is available on Netflix but so are so much better films from A24 like Good Time, The Witch and It Comes At Night so go watch those. Don't even bother with this one."
" Writing is a problem
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,3,"Never identify with any character. Don't really like him, and never cared whether he croaked or not. Spent part of the time on social media after about 20 minutes. Mostly writing problem and of course directing."
" I just visited Aokighara
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,10,"Yesterday i was driving through the Aokighara forest and i stopped by the road to just enter it a little. I have heard some stories about that place but didnt know fully about the matter. So i wanted to make some research about the place. I found this movie and it is really great. It describes the peace so beautifully. I am not sure why is this low rated.
This is not for rational souls. If your mind is at peace and your soul is calm you should watch it. Especially if you were like me, just visited the place and got curious about the place."
" Sea of Trees:. Transcendence
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,10,"""The Sea of Trees."" A movie directed by Gus Van Sant and written by Chris Sparling. Starring Matthew McConaughey, Naomi Watts, and Ken Watanabe. This movie was a big surprise. When it began, I thought someone went to great lengths to try to use The Aokigahara (the sea of trees in Japan) as a setting for a movie starring an American actor. How is that going to work? Well, as it turned out, it was done very cleverly, using flashbacks and an allusion to The Aeneid and Virgil, the guide through hell. Arthur Brennan's and his wife Joan's disintegrated relationship is the impetus for the death of their marriage and its subsequent journey into oblivion. Arthur endures a series of shocks to his system, and he undergoes a transformation.
When he enters the forest, he has a plan to end his pain. But a series of synchronicities leads him to a mysterious but wise guide who joins him on his quest. The result is that the guide leads him on a journey of self-discovery and realization. The wilderness they find themselves in is symbolic of chaos, danger, and hell. The fire, a life giving force and symbolic of the voice of God, elevates Arthur's spirit through the dialog with the kindly, probing guide . When Arthur finds his way out of hell, he finds himself in a safe haven or purgatory. When he continues his quest to understand his salvation, he finds a number of synchronicities which lead him to understand his salvation and give him Divine redemption.
Who would have thought that the Japanese Suicide Forest could have inspired such a wonderful, uplifting film? Really good acting, direction, and screenplay. This movie is on Netflix and Amazon Prime. Five of five stars. Enjoy!"
" I actually enjoyed this slow yet intense movie
",2019-08-31 00:00:00,8,"There are a lot of negative reviews about this film, some even going as far as stating it was 'boo-ed' during a screening at a festival, yacks! Despite all this the trailer gave me a good vibe so I decided to watch it.I really enjoyed it. The only real critique I would have is that it did not feature enough scenes Joan (Naomi Watts), in my opinion their relationship wasn't as developed as it could have been. Cohle.. I mean Arthur (Matthew McConaughey) has a monologue were he fleshes the relationship out, and fills in some essential details but that only left me longing for more of them.(Depending how sensitive you are to spoilers you might want to skip this section) I liked the way they tied up the movie. The way the pieces fit together in the end was nicely done, although perhaps a bit cliche, I though it fit well. I enjoyed it.Of course this movie is not for everyone. This isn't a movie to watch with your buddies and some beers, this is not the movie to watch when you want to have a good time. If instead however you are looking for something deeper and something that makes you feel something, give this one a go!"
" Better than the critic reviews said
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,9,"25 metascore doesn't fit this. It was pretty good, with some touching moments."
" Underrated
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,7,"I watched it in Cannes in 2015 during its world premiere. I liked it. There were people beside me shaking their heads. Maybe critics that were expecting another masterpiece from Gus. This is no masterpiece but still enjoyable, a good drama."
" Beauty inside the inferno
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,10,"So much beauty seamlessly inside the inferno. As a film experiment it brings textures of decay against fragments of the past to various resulting effect. Constantly it searches for the next image, the next revelation. Its tediousness is misunderstood. Its endless running time goes with the purposes of engulfing you. Ken Watanabe's landscape of a face in turmoil foils MM who is intimately de-contextualized, stripped of his stardom, creating a bizarre video fragment experiment. The movie the audience wanted is clipped inside like a nightmare Christmas Carol; it inverts, prods and guts the oscar bait in real time. The inferno of the purgatory is more like a trash compactor. The experience ought to be uncomfortable and painful as possible. ""I like what I do""--as in the mainstream fare completing his career trajectory from romantic comedies to oscar winning leading man to meta-reflexive mindwarps (romanticism->modernism->postmodernism). While Japan is so accommodating of this westerner not casting him out as exploiting or fetishizing their culture. ""We play baseball too."" The thousandth 'artless finding art after trauma' movie--although I always put it art is not a reaction but the ritual, but that art is trauma itself. Remember when he made Native American sounds over fire? It is all this post-political correctness, post-globalism, post-horror, everyone is everyone, everything is connected, every culture is just the next iteration being renewed. We avoid pain while it is a violently necessary process."
" Good Enough
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,6,"What I liked about this movie:
the cinematography, the landscapes, the shots, the atmosphere
the twist in the end
the mystical world built
the performancesNow, what I didn't like
the pace and the way they presented the story
the way the story unfolded was confusing
the ending was kind of clicheSo 6 out of 10."
" Amazing! Highly recommended
",2019-02-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie is quietly great! Beautifully written and acted. It takes you on a journey of love, loss, and life. And how our loved ones who have passed are always with us. I absolutely loved this movie!!!"
" Ignore the naysayers
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this movie. It seems like this the only kind of review I right on IMDB. Yes, there are legitimate criticisms of this movie. The soundtrack is a bit odd, it is somewhat predictable etc etc. is it deserving of a 1 or 2? Of course not, I say again as in previous reviews, don't be stupid people, be reasonable."
" the deep of regret
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Don't miss that deep movie it's full of the The usual drama.and if you don't care about the people around you, this movie for you.Keep your friends who you love so well and do what ever it takes to keep them.and By watching this movie you will know and appreciate the grace you are in.Because if you did not maybe you gonna drive your self to deep regret and deep sad that make you kill yore self!!!"
" The sea of deep .
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,7,"Starting from the perfect place to die notion, is it really? It's more evil than perfect I think this is not my type of mystery, because it made no sense to me, it is much fanciful for a plain mystery movie. to make a long story short it's about a widower who went to the infamous suicide forest which is purgatory place as they insinuated!, but I get it, they want to convey a message that your passed, loved, ones still care about you and somehow still watching over you, also it's the subject of the movie .after minor sequent of events he meets a Japanese man and off he embarks on his introspective, philosophical journey of self-discovering accompanying that strange dude ""Takumi"" although I didn't quite relish the idea there were some sentimental ,clever, unanticipated scenarios and an unsolved question for me ,who is Takomi is he Naomi's spirt in physical manifestation! That would be weird and illogical flaw that makes the movie enters the reincarnation genre i.e. ""I origins"" ,""A dog's purpose"".. etc."
" Wonderful,thought provoking movie!
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,10,"The plot and story of the movie are great!
The acting of all 3 main characters is excellent!
But why Matthew McConaughey was not at least nominated for an award like an Oscar or at least a Golden Globe is beyond me!!!
His acting left me speechless,just superb!
The acting,the story and the cinematography especially at the End of the movie are beautiful!
Just don't get bored in the beginning!!
The movie will pick up nicely and it will teach you about LIFE (and Death)and what's really important!This is not an Action Movie,just find your significant other and a time when you are not in a rush and enjoy!"
" Man vs World - In Depth Analysis
",2018-12-19 00:00:00,6,"The opening shots that setup the main character reveal a sense of man vs world. When he leaves his car, he has left the keys and cards inside telling us he has no intention of returning to the vehicle. We know it is instantly B when he takes no checked baggage. The man vs world is also on display when the lady at the desk struggles to find his ticket on the database. He looks unimpressed but expectant that it was going to happen. Then when he is going through the metal detector, he is stopped even though he is certain he has removed everything metal. Going to the extent of removing his shoes. He is then annoyed by an air hostess who asks him if he wants food when he is clearly resting. When he arrives, he heads straight to a forest and, after glancing into an old car, begins a serious stride of purpose. The trees look as though they are closing in on him and he is leaving the world behind. When he gets to the first sign, we know that there is something not right about this forest. More signs appear prompting the walker to think about their lives and not to end it. His stride continues as he crosses over a no entry barrier. He comes across a dead body, looks upon it and continues with no shock or major reaction. Now we know this is a place people come to die. He perches himself up on a little hump and starts to take pills. At first, he was going to take the lot but now he has decided to take one by one. While this is happening a Japanese man stumbles in front of him crying and muttering. The main character after some hesitation comes to his aid. After sending him on the right direction to get out of the forest. He turns to go back to his hump where his pills are. He then is struck by shock as nothing seems familiar. Then he begins to walk alongside the man. They are almost walking exactly the same with Watanabe's character a little higher and further back. Giving the impression that this is where our main guy will end up if he continues without a way out. When he finally finds a trail and sends ken on his way. He turns back to finish his suicide. But realises that the pills are with ken. When he runs back, he realises that the trail is blocked. As if the forest doesn't want his death to be by his own hands.
An instant flash back showing Mathew and his partner filling up a tank and having an argument in the car. Then they are at a party with other couples. We find out he is an unsuccessful writer and his wife isn't proud of it. They have a fake faced argument in front of the couples and Mathew squeezes her leg. They arrive home and are very distant. They are clearly not happy. The wife is drunk, and he gets her a water. And says what the hell are you doing to us. Flash back ends as ken takes a rest from walking and Mathew sees his cuts on his wrist and patches them up with his clothes. They climb a hill to a shrine. Mathew asks ken why you are doing this why do you want to die. He reply's I dint want to die. I just don't want to live. He then reveals his depression is based on his job. Mathew gets dizzy as the drug kicks in. His clothes are now ripped, and he looks more desperate. Ken questions Mathew on God and Mathew becomes defensive, saying I don't know who the hell you are, but I stopped to help you. Instantly Mathew walks of a cliff and falls far landing in a branch that goes through his waist. Ken climbs down and takes it out. Mathew is saying I don't want your help.
A flashback where Mathew comes home to his wife falling asleep while working. He slowly closes the laptop takes off her glasses and shoes. He then takes off his jacket and puts it over her. This all shoes how much he still loves her. She has left the teapot on and she awakes. A romantic moment slowly turns into a big argument. Revealing the huge tension between loving and being irritated by. He grabs her, and it becomes more elevated. He pegs a wine glass against the wall. The music fades to a softer tone as the wife is left alone and she realises she has a nose bleed. Flashback end. Mathew and ken are walking the tides are turned ken is rational whilst Mathew begins to freak out. Ken hears water and they both rush towards the sound of hope. They start to speak as tho they have hope. The music becomes more paces and there are shots of light following ken as he sees a flower and talks about spirits crossing over. From a distance Mathew sees a body. The person has hung themselves. The music stops, and creaking is heard. The wind picks up. Another flashback shows the wife going in for an MRI holding Mathews hand. As she goes in, they let go. They are told that she has cancer. Then the shot of the professor fading out in the class as his students are struggling to deal with his lack of teaching. He is then grocery shopping and again man vs world a lady has to put a grocery item back exactly where he is standing. Flash back end. Ken and Matthew are dragging their freezing bodies through the forest as it begins to rain. Ken finds shelter in a cave. Suddenly its flooded and they are both thrown out into a muddy terrain. Mathews character looks as though he is fighting to be alive. He sees ken unconscious and gives him mouth to mouth. The forest is giving them what they wanted but they are both now fighting to hold on to life. They find a dead person's tent. And remove the clothes of the dead man. The second time they have done this. Wearing the clothes of the dead to stay alive. In the next flashback Mathew and his wife talking about her treatment that could kill her. He tries to keep her laughing but as the conversation becomes serious, he makes a promise that he will die in a perfect place. She says that deep down we all know when we all will die.
Ken is singing to himself and Mathew has made a fire to stay warm. They have a radio and things are looking up. Mathew still doesn't want to recognise and spiritual aspects of the forest. They share a moment of laughter. The lack of music with the sound of fire crackling and the birds gives a very surreal peaceful feeling. It gets serious as they start to talk about his wife's death. It becomes a therapy session as ken questions Mathew trying to process every wound inside of him."
" Makes you think and feel
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,9,The best movie about how to recover from a deep dark tragedy where you think there is no hope.
" Ignore critics
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,9,"Do watch and take in the movie.
It cover many emotional aspects of relationships; the locations chosen are beautiful. The film is not cluttered with unnecessary 'noise' of CG effects.
I found it somewhat guiding in lessons."
" I think that I know why critics didn't like it.
",2018-12-12 00:00:00,10,"I loved this movie. Which made me curious about the reviews. I was shocked when I saw how many critics didn't like it. Then it hit me why they didn't. I would love to know how many of the critics who panned it either have no faith, no belief of God or are afraid to admit that they do. People don't usually like opposing viewpoints when it comes to these topics."
" Slow start but WORTH WATCHING!!
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,9,"This movie was fantastic. The acting and the cinematography, everything was great. And then the end it had me in tears."
" All right all right all right.
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,9,"I normally do not like movies that makes me reflect.. this movie, the acting, the scenery and directing were very good. I think this was one of Matthew better films."
" Lovely but sad
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,8,"Absolutely worth the watch, wonderful performances"
" Orchids Can't Live Like Dat
",2018-12-06 00:00:00,5,"It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it wasn't the best. I probably would've given it a 6 before the end scene where McConaughey is scooping up dirt from the ground and putting it into terra cotta pots for his exceedingly healthy orchid collection. The most unrealistic thing about the movie."
" Meaningful, insightful, inspiring!
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,10,"Stick with it after the slow start. It's an excellent movie. Not exeryone gets to have an experience like this in life, those who have had one don't often know how to share it in a way that gets the message across. This movie does."
" The rating on imdb is sooo off the mark.
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,10,"A brilliant thought provoking, yet subtle, movie. You've got to feel it to appreciate it. Gus van Sant take a bow."
" Solid 10 out of 10
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie may be the best movie I've ever seen in my life, probably because it is a movie about life with a little spiritual and paranormal twist to it as well. It was the best realistic representation of life and tragedy and relationships and inner conflict that we all have all in one story - amazing. The analogies presented are smart and beautiful. Matthew was spot on and casting Ken Watanabe in this was pure genius. If anyone gives this less than 10 then like just hasn't kicked them in the teeth enough yet. Let life happen to you some more then come back and watch this movie. You will have a deeper appreciation for it. Great great movie."
" Good movie
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,10,Movies like this so under rated and I don't why critics rate so highly about movies like pulp fiction highly. It's life learning lesson taught in this movie.
" Thoughtful and thought provoking
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,8,"With an Erie forest and a Erie theme of Suicide you are easily curious where this film is going to go. Is this real, is he really in some sort of purgatory, who is this guy who seems to know a lot about this forest? The film and its well timed perfectly structured flashbacks keep that curiosity. With various plantings that get paid off in big ways it is buttoned up tight and works quite well. After one watch you start revisiting scenes in your head re-deciphering them. Overall it was a pretty good movie."
" See !!
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,10,Great very heart warming story !! Very well acted !!
" Research First
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,10,"I have to figure people who don't know about suicide forest are the ones who didn't understand what was going on, thus resulting in poor reviews. Although predictable twists, this was very well done, maybe read the Wikipedia about suicide forest before watching."
" Soul searching
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,10,Very good story of couple with ordinary problems until a crisis puts life in proper perspective. My only complaint about the film is that McCougnahy (sp) can't take a walk in a forest without getting injured.
" Meta score ratings?
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,6,It's a film worth the watch just to show how critics are not always correct. I've seen films with higher scores that were mind numbing. This film does attempt to tell an actual story. Not a film I'd chose to shown at Cannes. It's an average film that attemps to be more than that.
" Deceptively Simple
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,10,"I almost didn't watch this movie because of the mention of suicide, because it sounded like it would be depressing. But the way we are guided through the story provides insights and epiphanies pointing to a potentially hopeful ending, as well as nuggets of widom for our own lives. All of that while unmasking the raw, gritty, and sometimes dark underbelly of relationships, even the best of which can be way more complicated than they appear on the surface. Ultimately it ends up being a story of redemption. Gus Van Sant takes us nearly as low as we can go, emotionally, as he backflashes us through Arthur's marriage. But that makes the ending that much more fulfilling, even if it doesn't follow the traditional course. No spoilers here, but it is absolutely worth it to watch to the end. The message transmitted through this story is one that will stick with you, and perhaps buoy you through your own complicated emotional sea."
" The will to live
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this movie. In summary, I sum it up as a strong man with a broken spirit walked into the sea of trees, then walked out as a broken man with a strong spirit."
" A Beautiful and Thought Provoking Story
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,10,Don't listen to the critics. This a truly beautiful story about how we deal with suffering and how we view our relationship with those who have passed and the afterlife. You must watch the film to the end. I was moved to tears and felt joy at the same time. How anyone at the Canne Film Festival could boo this movie is beyond me. They must have had the sensitivity of a toad. Pay attention to the conversatons between Matthew and Ken. Everything they speak about is drawn together at the end and will make you feel warm inside. Watch and enjoy!
" One of the best
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,8,"Not sure why this movie didn't get much attention. Cannes crowd booed it ? can't believe it. I thought Cannes crowd was the best !
It is one of the best of I have seen. The story narration, script and flow is unbelievably good. No matter what nationality are you, what God you believe, what language you speak, what your parents taught you, there are certain aspects of life that are not pure physics. It is common across mankind. Just quote from the Movie , and there are several ""It is during our darkest times that our loved ones are closest. Even those who have passed"". Find a quiet evening and watch it. It is in Netflix now."
" A critique of the criticism
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,8,"I swear some of you critics lack patience and imagination.
Sure, this isn't a fast paced action movie or a hide behind the blanket horror film. It's a drama and while it might be slow paced it unfolds nicely and certainly kept my interest. Perhaps that is because I am older and grew up with movies that you invested your time in, but regardless, this had great actors, a great story and was executed perfectly."
" Sea of Trees - HELP!
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,2,Some good scenes but not enough to hold my interest. Moved too slow. Actually leaning towards boring. Turned out to be a total waste of time.
" Poorly Executed & Open to Interpretation
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,4,"My friend thinks the lost Japanese man was imaginary. That our main character created him in a fantasy while dying, and that he related to him better than he did to his late wife, because he has been repressing homosexuality. He says there were numerous hints.
Also, the pacing was excruciatingly slow and the argument scenes with his wife in flashbacks were cliched and boring.
I like Matthew, but I never bought him as suicidal, and I didn't think any of the pretentious reflections on life were interesting.
I think that often film makers have a general idea of a potentially interesting setting or concept, but they don't know how to execute it. So they try to wing it and fail at epic levels. If they've already had some success, they can get a bad picture made based on their reputation.
I would have given more back story on both suicidal characters and had more insightful dialog. Don't waste your time, unless you are just really intrigued by the concept of a suicidal forest. That's what drew me in, but it wasn't enough."
" Worth the time
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,9,"This film starts out being quite morbid with an easily unlikable main character, but very slowly develops into a good story. There is a small touch of Its a Wonderful Life in this film. It ends very well on a positive note with a good twist to the plot. I almost turned it off halfway through due to the grim nature of it but was glad I watched the entire movie. It touches on the issues of selfishness, suicide, loss, redemption, and life."
" Interesting premise, poor execution
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,5,"As much as I wanted to like it, ""The Sea of Trees"" is not a very good film. I was attracted by the two principle actors (McConaughey and Watts), both of whom I generally like, and by the director, who has some excellent work in his resume, but after watching I have to join the group of people saying this film simply is not worth your time.This film fails mostly for technical reasons. The primary one being completely unlikeable characters. McConaughey's character was a complete and utter jerk in just about every scene of the film, start to end. In order for this film to work, he needed to have a sympathetic side, but the film did nothing to create one. None of the other characters were particularly likeable either. I also kept getting pulled out of the film by what I found to be poor production qualities, unrealistic plot holes, and overly melodramatic scenes.The premise of the film is actually quite interesting. If it was done as an animated film, like a Studio Ghibli film, the story could be made into something special. But as it stands, it rings heartless and hollow for me."
" A Slow Yet Promising Venture
",2018-09-22 00:00:00,10,"Set in the Japanese lands of Aokighara, The Sea of Trees tackles the ideal of suicide in a man's life, who thinks it's over for him in this modern and grown world. On his journey, to Aokighara (the sea of trees); known as the best place for one to die in this world, he encounters a companion. 
The movie grippingly shows the journey of both these men in the jungles of Japan, asking, talking and sharing about life and it's meaning.The idea of the entire movie is to grow upon the viewer as an emotion from the process of acquaintance to realisation and therefore, the climax of the movie, though portrayed subtly, hits the viewer hard; a very emotional climax. The Sea of Trees is a watch for people who are willing to give slow indies a chance and see the quality of such cinematic experiences growing altogether."
" Not touching
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,4,The story is just not making much sense. Too much absurdities made me unlatch the film and do something else.
" Beautiful!!
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,10,Great acting & directing. Three of my favorite actors as the lead characters. I don't think you have to be married to understand what this movie betrayed as a marriage with it's ups downs twists and turns. Love love loved it. For the romantic at heart.
" The bad reviews by critics are unjustified.
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,10,This is a beautiful film shot in beautiful locations. Dialogue may seem dull and droll to the critics but it is pensive and just enough. It has you questioning what is the main character thinking initially but all flows together seemlessly through time. I love the occasional film that is as thoughtful and wonderfully produced and acted as this. I highly recommend The Sea of Trees.
" Could have done without the last 10-15 mins
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,7,"Enjoyed the film and definitely worth the watch. The ending, however, ruined the film for me. We didn't need the last 10-15 mins where everything is tidied up for us. It would have lead to much more thought, conversation, and made the film more compelling."
" interesting towards the end
",2018-04-10 00:00:00,5,"SEA OF TREES : 6/10 .I have to admit, this movie is quite painful to sit through because there are mainly dialogues and flashbacks. Nonetheless, i did enjoy the beautiful scenery of the infamous japanese's 'suicide forest'. The movie began to show some interesting bits around 30mins towards the end, twist of plot, of course. the ending is nice."
" ponderous journey of self-discovery
",2018-02-11 00:00:00,4,"Arthur Brennan (Matthew McConaughey) travels to the Aokigahara forest in Japan where people go to commit suicide. There, he encounters Takumi Nakamura (Ken Watanabe). The movie also shows his troubled marriage to Joan Brennan (Naomi Watts).Director Gus Van Sant delivers a ponderous journey of self-discovery. Neither timeline is that compelling. The troubled marriage lacks energy which ends in a silly surprise reveal. The walk in the forest is only that while the audience waits for the inevitable reveal. This felt much longer than its running time."
" Adrift in a Sea of Trees
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,8,"Over recent years, several reviewers have mentioned finding the reviews and critical reactions given by the Academy and Festival critics - for mainstream and other titles, to be just about worthless. ""Trees"" is a reasonable case in point. While Mad Max and the like, are hailed way above their station, thoughtful life-affirming works are being thrown away â€“ some have begun to question these baseless critics.Chris Sparling (Buried 2010) with 'Sea of Trees', has written a thoughtful study about the places the mind goes when overcome by grief. The entire impact of this movie is fully engrossing. The performances, script, direction - the hauntingly beautiful cinematography by Danish documentary maker Kasper Tuxen, the artistic production design, all wrapped up in a score by modern symphonics composer Mason Bates, offers much to be admired.It's an exhausting experience for the thoughtful, patient viewer. At first, this looked like it was about to be yet another story unfolding in flash backwards/forwards mode - that often leaves you with little resolution. Thankfully, here, the pieces fit together in a rather unexpected way. It's slightly reminiscent of an earlier, now forgotten, Ben Hecht story ""Miracle in the Rain"" yet, also entirely different in overall tone. Mathew McConaughey and Ken Watanabe are perfect as the strangers brought together in the valley of death. It's good to see lovely Naomi Watts used to good advantage in a role worthy of her professionalism. For those who like to think and feel their entertainment, this is a must. If depressed or burdened by grief you might not be so drawn to its topic. Still, it's all first class â€“ regardless of the somewhat superficial festival crowds indifference."
" Beautiful movie
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,8,"I don't understand really why so low rating on IMDb. It's beautiful movie with talented actors, with nice soundtrack, with important thought about relationship and how we wast time of our life for quarrels. I enjoyed watching this movie. Highly recommended for couples."
" The perfect place to die
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,7,"Arthur Brennan (Matthew McConaughey) has had it tough and is has decided to do himself in as a privileged person by traveling to Japan's suicide forest. He chooses the cowards way out by taking pills. He has about 30 pills to take and it takes him half a bottle of water to swallow just 2 pills and has only one bottle. I'll let you do the math there. BTW the guy teaches physics. While attempting to get that third pill down he encounters a man (Ken Watanabe) who is more messed up than he is. Rather than continue with his plan, Arthur, our skeptic, helps the man. Arthur has flashbacks to his antagonistic relationship with his wife and we know how this formula film ends, even with that oh so clever twist done a gazillon times before.Might be a good bitter-sweet film for people who see something spiritual in every flower and cockroach on the planet and love those Lifetime dramas. Life really isn't that tough for the privileged folks in Seattle, except for those who decide to make it hard for themselves. My bad, I never developed any compassion for Arthur who never revealed himself as a likable guy until he decided to kill himself for feeling guilty for being a dirt bag. Nice scenery.No sex or nudity. Didn't catch any F-words."
" A Powerful Look at Love, Grief and Appreciation for Life
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,7,"Director Gus van Sant is well known for touching dramas such as the Oscar winning ""Good Will Hunting"" and this offering is one of his most underrated films. Following a grief-stricken widower who wanders around an isolated forest with a mysterious stranger, the film takes a hard look at what led our protagonist to where he is and also gives insight into accepting death, love and the process of grief.With only three core players in the cast, the setting of the forest, Aokigahara, in Tokyo we really spend most of the time with the characters of Arthur Brennan (Matthew McConaughey) and Nakamura Takumi (Ken Watanabe) while we are provided with flashbacks that outline the relationship between Arthur and his wife, Joan (Naomi Watts).Matthew McConaughey's performance as Arthur is an enigma when we first him as we follow him when heading into Aokigahara. We learn early on that Arthur is an academic professor; specifically a science instructor. While Arthur may not have too much trouble applying his intelligence to his students, the same cannot be said of his treatment of his wife, Joan, which is a tumultuous roller-coaster at best. As the story progresses we are given insight into his life with Joan which comes off as loving and happy until we see the two argue when left alone and it's clear there are issues with their marriage. There may have been love in the relationship at first, but the marriage is clearly troubled except in the fate of imminent tragedy we see how devoted Arthur really is to Joan despite how angry he and Joan have been towards each other. McConaughey taps into Arthur's hidden sadness by slowly revealing the reason he has come to the forest, his actions are equally reckless as Arthur wallows in grief; unable to cope with how to process his feelings. The film's climactic reveal of Joan's passing absolutely packs an emotional punch as McConaughey pours his heart out in how Arthur feels that he did a disservice to his wife while she was alive, but learns from Watanabe's Takumi that Joan's spirit is with him despite how upset he had been with her in the past and with himself.Supporting players Ken Watanabe and Naomi Watts also bring their best to the story as they are integral to the Arthur's journey. 1. Watanabe as Takumi is first introduced as a rambling lost soul in the forest, just as lost as Arthur is. As he travels along with Arthur, Takumi begins to probe into Arthur's past though the latter is reluctant to divulge much and just wants to die. Takumi's persistence pays off as Arthur's kindness prolongs Takumi's own wish to die (and begins to undermine Arthur's own death wish). We don't learn until late in the film why Takumi's wistful encouragements about Joan's after-death presence end up so true. 2. Naomi Watts's performance is used sparingly, but provides the film's ending gut-punch. As Joan, Watts is smart and sophisticated as she is an academic like her husband, but she is plagued with demons. Despite her and Arthur's academic education, she is jealous of her husband's past success and to cope with her frustration with Arthur, Joan becomes an alcoholic. Arthur is quick to blame Joan for her behavior while she points the finger right back at his lack of affection or interest in her feelings. When Joan becomes sick, we start to see how little both Joan and Arthur really know about each other. We get to see them banter back and forth trying to learn about each other, but tragedy cuts their potential happiness short. The audience gets to share in Arthur's grief at losing Joan, but also get to see him change and feel a closeness to his late wife that didn't exist while she was alive.The narrative does take some time to get moving as the camera tracks Matthew McConaughey through the forest and little of the plot is revealed. Once Ken Watanabe's Takumi is introduced and also the flashbacks to Arthur and Joan's marriage commences, the story does get more interesting and gets to the heart of why McConaughey's Arthur is in Aokigahara. It's easy to stay stone-faced for the majority of the run-time, the tears will start to well up as Arthur pours his heart out to Takumi and then learning how Joan died finally hits hard especially for anyone who has had such a tragic loss."
" Very thought provoking
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,10,"I thought it was great. At first I thought it was going to be very depressing. Kept at it and it really spoke to me. Didn't like the alcoholic part too much, thought was unnecessary. After it was over, it made me go make a list to ask my husband and grown kids questions e.g. favorite color, season, book, and many other questions. Nice thought provoking and redemption story."
" Why we should keep going on
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,9,"Excellent movie that makes you really think about how life has many twists and turns and sometimes can be pretty rough for a while, and yet as we persevere we eventually see why things happen in our lives the way that they do. Our lives are really a series of unique tests that are individually tailored to each of us so that we can gain useful and crucial experience that helps us grow and be able to deal with each next step we take on our journey of life.The movie has a lot of parallels with Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life: Think of the Japanese man, Takumi Nakamura, that Arthur Brennan meets in the forest as It's a Wonderful Life's Clarence the Angel who jumps off the bridge right as George Bailey is almost ready to jump off, because he knows that George will instinctively jump off to save him, instead of taking his own life. Takumi and Arthur's subsequent conversations and journey trying to find their way back to the trail/parking lot is a lot like George Bailey in the end wanting to get back to his life that he hadn't previously thought of as being anything close to a wonderful life. Very last scene of It's a Wonderful Life is the written message George Bailey receives from Clarence in a copy of Tom Sawyer that states. "" No man's life is a failure who has friends."" Near the end of Sea of Trees Arthur receives the book Hansel and Gretel in which there is a message from the Takumi that has the season and color that is Matthew's wife's favorite season and color."
" Conceptually Deep
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)If you could choose a location to die, would you and where? How about forest at the base of Japan's Mount Fuji? This is a decision the protagonist, Arthur, makes. While finding the ideal spot to take his dose of pills, he encounters a Japanese man wandering around looking for the way out of the forest. Arthur tries to help the man and as they interact they share deep emotions about why they are both hereÂ….yet will they both decide to leave? Interspersed are flashbacks to Arthur with his wife with their tumultuous relationship and what leads him to this decision. A nicely shot film with well-told scenes about what truly matters in this world and to not give up on those things. A calmly told tale of sorrow, revitalization and joy arguably lacking authentic depth rather than clichÃ©d moments."
" Powerful story that moved me, and stayed on my mind for days after
",2017-05-17 00:00:00,9,"I don't understand why the low score for this film. This is one of those films that touched, moved and inspired me. It was recommended by a priest at a memorial for a man who passed away at 83. The priest spoke of marriage, as the departed left behind his wife of fifty plus years. The message was to recognize in ourselves any way in which we lose ourselves and begin to kill off the love and joy between ourselves and our family members, and particularly, our spouse.I was immediately engrossed in the story. I saw pieces of myself in both McConaughey's and Watt's characters. The story deals with love, hope, being lost, getting stuck in anger and resentment, on compassion, redemption, and renewal.It is an edifying story that will resonate in my mind for a long time. It serves as a parable. It is spiritual as well as gripping and suspenseful."
" Into the Forest
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,7,"Some forests seem to have a reputation about them. Though I do wonder how it is, they don't actually do something about those. I mean if you are aware that people go there for a specific (and horrific if I may add) reason, you'd think they would try to put measures in place to stop people from doing something they won't be able to regret.But if that were the case, you wouldn't have this movie now would you? And it's a fine movie overall. I read it got bad reviews and reactions in Cannes, which is a bit surprising. Especially considering this feels like a movie that should be at home in Cannes (no pun intended). The acting is really good and while you mostly have 2 characters (with some flashbacks where more people are being seen), it never is boring. If you like Drama that is of course ..."
" Change of heart in the ""suicide forest"".
",2017-04-25 00:00:00,7,"A very distraught Arthur Brennan (Matthew McConaughey), is ready to end it all and purchases a one-way ticket to Tokyo. Arthur, hopelessly trying to deal with the memory of his love/hate relationship with his wife Joan (Naomi Watts), seeks out Japan's famed Aokigahara Forest, the ""suicide forest"". Brennan plans on taking his life with an overdose of sedatives, when his plan is disrupted by another lost soul wandering the winding trails. Takumi Nakamura (Ken Watanabe) has had a change of heart and is wanting to actually find the way out of the forest. So what began as a task of killing themselves instead will become something powerfully different.The story line is quite depressing; the scenery is a contrast of ugliness and beauty. The acting is heartfelt and believable. McConaughey is dynamic. Also appearing are: Katie Aselton, Bruce Norris, Anna Friedman and Ryoko Seta."
" One of the best movies I have ever seen!
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,10,"This movie was so moving, beautiful and so well acted. Matthew McConaughey and Ken Watanabe are so good in this. Make sure you can sit down and really focus on it. I don't get the reviews that describe it as slow. I loved it! The critical reception of this film boggles my mind. Some of the worst movies gain critical praise, and gems like this go unnoticed."
" Meaningful, Captivating & Clever
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,10,"The fact that anyone would boo this movie is despicable. My husband and I have become accustomed to doing the opposite of the critics for this very reason. If this movie is so boring, how did it keep me up until 2 am?! We started the movie very late in the night, but I was hooked and remained hooked the entire time, I couldn't fall asleep!! The last movie to do that to me was Ex Machina and Interstellar. This is a deep movie, perhaps people that attend film festivals are those considered to be still ""unconscious"". It's just one big circle jerk of wannabees anyways right?"
" Atmospheric
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,7,"This scenario has a really good potential. A man who want's to end his life, meets another man who want's to be saved. Through this interaction the first man starts to heal himself. There were a lot of metaphors in speech and symbolism with objects - nature. It is a deep movie, one of those which can be watched multiple times to discover something new every time. You could say that this story is about human soul - it's weaknesses, struggles, salvation etc. It leaves you hopeful at the end despite of the things that had happened although it's quite heavy movie altogether. Couple of things that I didn't like was one quite unbelievable coincidence that happened and the explaining of the mystical events at the end. The mystery was gone for me. Usually it's done for the audience - because the director or someone thinks that people will not understand the event's/not smart enough, so it has to be fed to them artificially. This moment took away so much for me. I wish they hadn't done that... But I liked watching it, living through this story, feeling that atmosphere. You could feel that people who created this movie have put a lot of thought into it."
" Solid, Emotional Film with Deep Acting and Themes
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,6,"I really don't understand the extreme harsh reviews. The film is too long for the story and starts a bit slow as well as there being some unlikely or highly coincidental moments but there is so much emotion in the characters of this film and Mcconaughey especially relays this beautifully. Many tearful moments and a very satisfying ending. Impressive cinematography although a somewhat predictable score. The relationship between Watts and Mcconaughey is full of real emotion, grounded in reality.Definitely worth the watch overall, however there are flaws to look past."
" I can't believe it stayed so unwatchable all the way through
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,1,"I'm a big fan of Matthew McConaughey, and Naomi Watts isn't bad either. I'm surprised those big name stars let themselves to this snoozer of a movie.This was just about the biggest waste of nearly two hours. I watched it all the way through but was bored to tears on top of being depressed by it. The acting was fine, the story would have had some merit, but the direction just sucked the life out of this project. I paid attention to the rating and didn't do my research before watching it. My mistake.Looking through the filmography of director Gus Van Sant I see that this is the only movie by him that I've watched. And I watch a lot of movies. I'll be sure not to watch any of his other projects either.There was a decent story, although predictable, behind this work, but the way it was presented would put anyone to sleep. Also if you have a tendency toward depression and suicide I suggest you don't even give this a try.This has to be put at the bottom of my all time favorite list."
" Better than how it first seems...
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,7,"This is a good movie. Machonaughy plays a role he doesn't usually play as does Watts. Wonatabe as well. The film explores the importance of living in the moment, tension in marriages, suicide, terminal illness, loss, guilt, supernatural forces and the power of the human spirit. It is one of those films that causes you to think. It isn't an entertaining film but it is so thought provoking on many levels that more than makes up for it. Watts is very good as are the other two actors. The Forest is a neat place as is any forest. Watch this one as it will cause you to think on things you might not otherwise give much thought."
" Don't waste your money or time
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,1,"This film violates the cardinal rule of screen writing:never bore your audience. I tried hard to stay interested in what seemed to be a developing story, but I was able to watch two men talking in hushed, incomprehensible tones, wandering in a dark forest for just so long before I was bored out of my gourd. I kept thinking there must be a point to this, but I didn't have the stamina to hang in there to find out. And was he really trying to commit suicide? It's highly unlikely that someone in that frame of mind would suddenly be moved by compassion to help a stranger, who seemed to be in serious physical trouble, but then managed to trek on through the rugged terrain. All in all a case of bad Hollywood judgment."
" You must watch
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"Despite the depression in the movie, but I was satisfied when I was watching it. The movie took me to a strange journey like the journey of death or maybe we can say a journey of introspection and facing ourselves. There are many emotions in this movie like Hope, despair, surrender, courage, sacrifice, love, hate, regret and feeling guilty. Matthew performance was very great, Naomi was good but not good enough she could do more. The shooting was so great, also the direction, the story and the script. One last thing, the lesson of the movie I think that you might think that you didn't know someone very close to you will but in deep down and with the right incentive you knew them. It was a great drama movie, I loved it and you must watch it unless you are depressed. :D"
