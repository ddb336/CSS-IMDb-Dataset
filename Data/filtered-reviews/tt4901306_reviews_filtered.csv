" ...well acted, touching, both funny and serious, and above all deftly plotted and scripted.
",2021-03-25 00:00:00,10,"During a dinner party, seven friends decide to play a dangerous game. Relationships falter and friendships are shredded in this dark-Italian comedy."
" Witty and well scripted show
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,9,This movie is wonderful example of making the full film in one set in room with few characters without exotic locales and actions. Really a new concept and opening of characters based on simply all open smart phones.
" Amazing
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,10,"Thrilling, funny and cozy. Could even have been a bit longer. I recommend."
" Recommend to anyone
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,8,It was amazing. You get surprised through it for times. Characters are real and you can feel them. You can be one of them.
" Wow
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,8,What a movie! I was nailed to the ground till the end! Woooow! It was so scary!
" boring af
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,3,Borrrrrring af nothing intresting is ever happening
" Interesting but wrong happy ending
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,8,"Very good film with interesting dialogues,realistic social problems,
that didn't deserve that happy ending."
" Violently beautiful!!
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,9,"Somehow it is an awakening from this century's issues and it focuses especially on truth, appreciation, understanding and friendship. It definitelly makes the viewer to reflect a bit more on what matters."
" Deep thinking
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,"The film had regrets that mobile phones have become the black box of human information, once opened, all the secrets will be exposed.
This is the inevitable result of the information explosion.
During the Industrial Revolution, we relied on newspapers for news, telegrams for urgent messages, distant relatives and friends taking their greetings out of envelopes, and thoughts of lovers being conveyed only at meetings.
How about now? All it takes is a phone.
The diversity of information transmission means the complexity and inefficiency of information transmission. The decrease of diversity means the centralization of information ports and the unification of communication rules, which will inevitably bring huge information explosion."
" LOVE THIS.
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,8,"I loved every moment of this movie. Plot is great, ending is unexpected. Great script. This very unconvensional film is hillarious."
" Good theme and acting but the ending is too weird
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,6,"The movie shows how futile our social interactions are and how little we reveal of ourselves. Great idea. The start of the phone game looks quite believable, however some other moments are hard to believe.Lovers are supposed to be hating each other's at the end but for some reason it all looks like a dream and order is restored, just like the moon. Very random ending."
" The performance was wonderful, but the plot in the second half was not as exciting as expected.
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,7,"The tense and stimulating atmosphere in the first half is well created, and the back is a bit too dramatic and chaotic. Obviously, the following plot is not so attractive to me.The ending is full of irony and human hypocrisy."
" Boring
",2020-02-14 00:00:00,2,Ok the idea is good but the storyline is so boring and expected.. I was patient throughout all the conversations but then found it was a waste of time.
" a revealing reliever
",2019-12-28 00:00:00,9,"Its a smasher film of modern day technology and the new and modern way of dynamics of life. its about the cell phone and the way it has become a treasure cabinet, diary, and medium of secrecy, or the modern edition of the blackbook as they say in the film.its a film about revealing secrets about eachother, in a party setting, as a game of do or dare, all cellphones are on the table and everything shall be read and heard in plenum, no exceptions. its a highpowered idea to make film about, and what comes out here, really shoud make yourself consider, will my phone pass my wifes scrutinous eyes. well i guess im rather safe because ive got no digital life except what i deal out here on imdb,and the compulsary ping the phone leaves at every cell tower i pass, but have a take on the topic. its a story that will be copied by bolly and hollywood in the futuredo watch this film, its brilliantly made in all aspoects, could have been a 10 if delwed even deeper, its one smashing recommend from the grumpy old man"
" We still two persons
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,8,"It's all about the secret, that deep one, that tells the story about us. We keep hiding it cause we can't handle the truth, specifically the ugly one.
Having such secret is not really the saddest part. It's hinding it from the people you trust the most - or supposed to be the most trusted! - which means whoever you commit to in a whatever relationship, you still two persons, you never melt together, you'll ever have that un-crossed border.."
" Just another melodramatic story with a twist.
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,2,"Without over-analyzing and searching for the hidden meanings:
This is just another predictable melodramatic story driven by misunderstandings and constraints of social norms and cliches of married life.
Like a theatrical play it is filmed almost entirely in one location. But I wouldn't recommend it to individuals, who like the ""The Man from Earth"" (2007).
The actors looks natural though.
The main idea with phones was promising but the movie betrayed me leaving in anticipation for something unexpected to happen.
The film ended abruptly leaving me wondering ""what the hell just happened?"" (probably because I watched this film with subtitles)"
" Great Topic, Great Acting and a Great Movie
",2019-05-07 00:00:00,9,"It was a great movie. Comedy, drama and tension was a full dose. The dialogues were fantastic. I had a movie to watch with my friends. I also loved the performance of Marco Giallini. Attention: The movie should not be watched with spouses :)"
" Excellent
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,9,"I have to say, I haven't seen that much Italian movies, just some classics like Ladri di Biciclette, and some Fellini movies, but this is a film that can compare with the previous ones. Proof that you can make a beautiful contemporary film without large budget or use of CGI. Have enjoyed it very much and recommend it to everyone."
" Perfect chance to find yourself
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,8,"Do you really know your friends? Do you know all their secrets? Do you have to? If you knew them, how would you react? Do you keep secrets from them? Do you want to find out about them? I could keep making this kind of questions. So many easy questions, but so hard to answer them lighthearted. This film accomplishes something great. Through an enjoyable and easy to watch comedy, it testes the limits of human relationships and how much easy would be for us to accept the real truth of a friend/companion that it's hidden from us. The sure thing is that through this process, you will find your true self..."
" So this is marriage
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,8,"The preference for films full of clever quipping is growing in me. I would like this film even more if I can understand Italian, I presume. The morale of the film, nevertheless, has strengthened my bleak view on marriage. Is it that marriage is nothing but an intentional blindness for a lifelong whopper, and through this mutual tolerance disguised as ""trust"" we carefully build a delicate balance that is always prone to fall apart at an unexpected moment."
" Indoor theatre
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,9,"Indoor theatre is completely supported by acting skills. The beginning paves the way for a slight leak; from the mobile phone on the table, it seems to have grasped the context; but the follow-up development of the plot, still unexpected surprises; and when it comes to the end, it is found that the whole film is in order to pave the way for the last three minutes. What irony and humour this ending is. How many secrets do people hide in modern society? Who should believe what? How to continue after knowing the secret? Every character is so real and natural, the overall rhythm from slow to fast, from jokes to bursts, smooth and natural. Deficiencies in Beauty: Creativity is not new, the picture is slightly dusk."
" Not good enough
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,5,"The harvest is quite a lot after watching it, everyone has their own secrets, human nature is the most can not stand the test of things. But the pace of the film is really worrying, as a seat talk film the substitution is too slow,meanwhile, the last 30 minutes especially at the end of the processing is still good, but the overall failing"
" Entertaining and smart little movie
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,7,"I really love the screenplay and dialogue, it just feels so natural. It's very smart made Italian film with a lot of funny and unexpected moments. I am little dissapointed by ending but it is just my opinion so you might like it."
" Absolutely entertaining
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,7,"Extremely entertaining. If you like a film that keeps your interest alive all through, go for it."
" A smart way of depicting
",2018-10-30 00:00:00,7,"A smart of way depicting the corruption in family as the core brick of a big wall called society.
This movie was not only a presentation of what is going on, but a warning of what is going to happen as a consequence to such problems."
" Interesting concept but very poor execution.
",2018-10-26 00:00:00,1,My Rating : 0/10I was expecting an interesting people-in-a-room a la The Invitation or Coherence however this was utterly disappointing.Skip this.
" The black box of our lives.
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,10,"Seven old friends (3 couples and a divorced man) are going to have a dinner and admire the eclipse of the moon. But as soon as they get together and start enjoying dinner one of them, woman named Eva, offers to play a game: they should share all text messages and incoming calls they received during the dinner. Some of them agree to play, some of them disagree and afraid of consequences, some of them want to be unmasked. Finally all of them start the game. They all are old friends - what could go wrong? But secrets are coming out...
One by one everyone's secrets are becoming public. Tension increases with every sound of ringtones. One lie causes other lies.
Characters are not very conspicuous as long as you don't know their secrets. For instance, there are the psychologist that doesn't accept herself (definitely she needs a therapy), a couple that bound together for only a guilty conscience, a husband cheating on his wife every chance he has. Your estimate of each character chances during the film.
Despite all lies, a friendship takes its place in the film. For example, it is very exciting to watch how Lele covers Beppes secret instead of saying true about him and acquitting himself.
The tension of the movie is diluting with humour. Jokes are well-timed and amusing.
Actors are excellent, you start to believe everything since the first minute. It seems like you are one of them, and you feel nervous about your own skeletons in the closet.
The film looks like a theatre play with minimum of decorations and actors. There is not much action in the film, but it is full of dialogues on philosophical and controversial issues which make audience think of them. However the main idea is that our secrets are not well-secured and mostly contained in a little box with screen and buttons.
The ending is very strong and emotional, in my opinion. The question ""is it necessary to know the truth, if it could ruin your relationships?"" is another thing to think about. This film doesn't give answers for questions it raises, but leaves you options.
I highly recommend to watch the film ""Perfect Strangers"" (""Perfetti sconosciuti"") by Paolo Genovese, it captures the attention of audience from the beginning and keeps up the suspense until the last minute. I felt empathy for all actors during the film."
" What a gem!
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,10,"Simple and great script (friends of 7 having dinner), incredibly good acting with sharp dialogues. A story on emotions, relationships and marriage and how these are influenced by the modern world (smartphones). Feels a bit too intense sometimes but everything fits at the end.Do not read about the movie, watch it! A must see!"
" Perfect Escapade
",2018-06-29 00:00:00,8,"7 friends have a dinner reunion, they start talking about each other and decide to play a game then some of their personal secrets get uncovered so the conflicts break loose, as the time goes the more tense and serious it gets. Sometimes the truth hurts. The topics of conversations are really interesting to follow as well. As the viewer, i get mixed feelings throughout the movie because it gets funny and sad in a good balance. The characters're played well by the actors. I wouldn't be surprised if Hollywood remakes it. 
Just stay focus at first since the conversation's quite fast for a while, after then you'll be hooked to know how the plot goes. Really enjoyable even just from reading the subtitle, i can't imagine how good it'd be if i understand it by listening.So if you have a bad day and feel like to have some laugh and something cheerful, try watching this.8/10"
" Everything can change...
",2018-03-14 00:00:00,7,"""Perfect Strangers"" is a comedy-drama movie in which we watch seven people who are very good friends get together for dinner. As they are eating they have an idea of playing a game. This game is very simple, they have to share with each other the content of every text message from WhatsApp, Viber etc, email and phone calls they receive while they are eating and they are together with the others. As time passes a lot of secrets are revealed and each relationship between all these people can change. I liked this movie very much because the plot was something completely different from all the other movies that I had watched. It's an amazing movie, with twists, a very well-written script and a very good plot. This movie is a very good example of what a simple movie with a low budget and filmed only inside a house can succeed. I liked the direction which was made by Paolo Genovese and I believe that it was amazing and the combination of the well-written script it was the recipe for success. I also liked the interpretations of Marco Giallini who played as Rocco, Giuseppe Battiston who played as Peppe, Edoardo Leo who played Cosimo and Kasia Smutniak who played Eva. To sum up I have to say that ""Perfect Strangers"" is a very interesting movie in which we can understand a lot about the relationships between people, from a simple friendship to a passionate and lovely relationship. I believe that everyone can gain something by watching this movie and that's why I strongly recommend for everyone to see it."
" A good example of modern relational problems
",2018-02-14 00:00:00,8,"It's been a while since I last saw an Italian movie, and I'm glad to say that I really missed that authenticity. At first, you can have an impression it is going to be an ordinary movie taking place in a simple apartment. and it continues for a while as you thought. When suggesting a strange idea, movie is getting interesting and the climax comes up gradually.  The actors are fervently performed. But I cannot say the same thing for the actresses, giving just what they you expect from them nothing more or less. 
 The screenplay is the backbone of the movie, when you sort of feel like okay that's enough I can fall asleep while watching, the signs of further excitement begin to show itself and keep you awake until the end. I think the writers deserve a praise. I can definitely say it is an emotionally strong movie but sometimes you can feel bored, especially in the first half. But after that it goes smoothly, until the hypothetical scene. It will be worth your time."
" A Bit Over-the-Top at Times but Still a Triump
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,10,"A rare comedy geared for adults with a lot of great dialogue and fine acting. I didn't recognize any of the actors which is something I love. For me this adds a lot or verisimilitude, I believe the actors are who they are portraying. If I see a famous actor it's more difficult to get to this point of believing and instead you're saying, ""There's Tom Hanks."" There is a lot of clever dialogue in this and I laughed quite a few times. I just can't imagine a cast of famous American or British actors pulling this off. It will be interesting to see the Spanish remake of this film. I think a Spanish remake is totally unnecessary; people should just watch the original."
" Funny games
",2017-12-22 00:00:00,7,"Depending on how you look at it the idea behind Perfetti Sconosciuti (Perfect Strangers) could be seen as quite ambitious or an absolute nightmare. Almost the entire film takes place in a single location in an apartment, where a small group of friends have gathered for a dinner party. Over the course of the evening - for the next hour and a half of the film - we and their friends gradually find out what little secrets each of them keep. No-one's life is going to be the same again.It starts out as a little experiment, a game, and it doesn't sound terribly promising.. Three couples and one single friend - whose new girlfriend wasn't well enough to attend - sit down to dinner and the banal conversation inevitably turns around to discussing the differences between about men and women. Men are like PCs apparently and women are Macs. A point of contention however is established over the situation of one of their friends who is going through a divorce; his wife having discovered he was having an affair with a 22 year old. ""How many couples would split up if they looked at each other's phones"", they wonder. Well, let's play a game then...They all agree to leave their phones on the table, and any message, text or call that arrives during the evening must be shared with everyone. Surely everyone will agree to this, unless they have something to hide. Well, there's little doubt that secrets will be revealed and attempted to be explained, but the question is who will be found out? All of them? And how bad will it be? What soon becomes apparent is that the evening is not going to end well, and any hope of damage limitation vanishes as the evening gradually descends into anger, recrimination and complete havoc.It's not just the subject that is divisive here, but the manner in which the film handles this potentially vicious game is also a tough one to call. Paolo Genovese is not Michael Haneke, so no-one is going to be responsible for the genocide of a colonial nation or crimes against humanity, but the director's take on the romantic-comedy with a touch of philosophising in films like Tutta copla di Freud (Blame Freud) doesn't inspire confidence that Genovese is capable of revealing any real insights on relationships, particularly though such a contrived situation.If it was an out-an-out comedy - or even just a little funnier - you might find Perfetti Sconosciuti an amusing distraction with some interesting observations, but Genovese tries to make it into an ""issue"" film and moralise a little, and there he's on less secure ground. Having said that, there's much to enjoy in the situation and performances - the film winning David di Donatello awards for Best Director and Best Screenplay awards in 2016 - and once on-board, you'll want to see this through to its inevitably catastrophic conclusion. Inevitably? Well, twists abound, which is another divisive tactic and a sign perhaps on lack of commitment, but when the film makes its point either way, it's hard to feel cheated."
" loved it
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,9,"A quite interesting movie. Maybe in real life things don't match in such a quick time and things take more time to happen. However the plot is an actual one and it shows secrecy is part of our life even if we like it or not. I really enjoyed it and tasted it ;) Some of the best movies I've seen lately. The night scene from the balcony, the conversations near a glass of wine under the moonlight, the funny moments when one of the friends was covering the other's lie and secret ""thing""... I think I watched this movie with great pleasure as if I was serving a delicacy. Also couldn't stop laughing (and I was laughing with tears for several minutes ) when one of the friends was covering the other who was not ready to admit anything and he let his friend make a fool of himself. I found the movie by mistake but it will remain a favorite in my film collection. 100 % worth seeing."
" Stunning
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,9,"Lately if you choose to watch European movie you'll not make mistake. This movie is Italian comic life drama. Three married couple and one bachelor having dinner. They are long time friends. One of the subject was that they don't have secrets. That's the time when complication start. Very simple. Great acting, realistic. I enjoyed this movie."
" Actually I do not know if it's drama or it's surreal
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,6,"What do I mean? Well, the film, although it takes a long time to start, then it starts to get interesting, obviously you know where it's going to go, otherwise there would not be a movie. It takes but it arrives, the problem is that the end, I do not know what it tells me, I tell it in the spoiler zone.In general, the actors are very good. They are a group of friends and I'm sure some of them did not know each other a few days before.It looks like a theatrical play, with so many characters there could be a great staging, moving the characters, not having them sitting so long. It would have given much more life to the film and could have made some great plans.Photography is beautiful, being inside, it handles everything and it helps to tell the story.The direction, get some good performances, but lacks pace at the beginning. But it fails to give a good staging and the plans are simple.It's a good movie, since you believe it and it hooks you, but it could be better.Spoiler: I do not know if what he wants to tell is the forgiveness of one another or if the moon changes us or that it has been a dream. I do not know why that change of mood in all the characters."
" One of the best films I've seen so far
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,10,"I really loved the entire film, the acting, the writing and the directing all were great !! Six years back I've watched a documentary film after which I ended up a passionate wildlife photographer and filmmaker. I'm not sure but Perfect Strangers may be the drive to try fiction films as a career !"
" Underrated
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,9,Good movie and everybody has to watch it because it is a story and a lesson showing us that phones started to be our life that little box can be a source of pain and problems and instead of focusing on our lives and live it fully we waste our time on stupid things leaving behind things that matter
" High quality cinematography and food for thought
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,8,"(Mild spoilers). Just one dinner party with three married couples and a single man. Genre oscillates between comedy and drama. In the process, it offers a fresco of contemporary Italian upper middle class, with the current smart-phone epidemic as central theme. They dare each other to openly share messages and conversations on all phones.There is a final twist, reminiscent of ""Dangerous Corner"" the old play by J.B. Priestly: the dilemma between a pleasant exterior held up by lies and hypocrisy and the painful truth underneath.I had a problem during part of the movie confusing husbands and wives and who was doing what to whom, but that may be just me (difficulty in identifying characters). So will watch it again more carefully.Absolutely recommendable."
" Wonderfully directed!
",2017-05-31 00:00:00,10,Excellent plot. Tension is high all along the film. With simple resources it succeeds to have an extraordinary story-line and keeps the audience constantly alert and there are belly laugh moments. The end: best of all. It shows the ugly truth of our lives in a humorously tone and it is very realistic. In two words: IT ROCKS!
" Stands head and shoulders above its Hollywood counterparts
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,8,"I don't remember when was the last time a saw a high quality comedy. Ninety percent of comedies that come from Hollywood are immature gibberish filled with trivialities which portray life as it never is. But now finally comes a comedy movie for grown ups with thematic elements suitable for mature audiences. Perfetti sconosciuti is very funny, sometimes sad, intelligent and charming in a way only European movies can be, especially Italian and Spanish.Seven friends gather for a dinner. Table is and always has been a central element of human activities. Food opens people up for friendship and humor. Now, these seven people carried by such delight agree to play a game which may bring to surface things they never wanted to share. They have known each other for years but it turns out only superficially. Perfetti sconosciuti is pretty serious movie when stripped from jokes and charm. That has to be so since sharing, or more so unwillingly sharing, our deepest secrets and desires with people whom we know for years in unbelievably difficult; more difficult than sharing those things with strangers. That's why I've written that this movie is a comedy made for mature audiences - younger viewers just won't be able to read fine details and understand the difficulties, which come with years, this movie brings about.Tempo of the movie is perfectly hit. Everything looks absolutely natural. There are no more important or less important scenes. All of them come together as to form a uniform experience. That way the viewer somehow becomes eighth person invited to the dinner, figuratively speaking. This is something similar to the way conversation keeps flowing in 12 Angry Men. Since Perfetti sconosciuti is a talk movie, acting plays a pivotal role since there are no many other elements which can compensate for it, in contrast to American made comedies which are almost entirely adventure oriented. In all sincerity I have to admit that this seven people did better job with acting than most of their over-hyped and planetary famous Hollywood colleagues. All of them covered a very wide range of emotions in a very convincing manner.This is very refreshing and brave movie to make which I warmly recommend, especially to those of you who are tired of trivial humor, trivial characters and plots. You may even discover a thing or two about yourself."
" Dinner with friends leads to unpleasant secrets revelations
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,7,"Perfect strangers is a successful film, of necessity contrived because it is built on a successful gimmick- don't want to reveal it here. Takes place largely in dining room (was it a play before a movie?). Good movie symbolized by eclipse of moon occasionally watched by the diners, and ending hinted at by it. Not everything credible, but we are not watching War and Peace, or maybe so, in a sense. Plenty of pasta in evidence, so you and your partner may want to go out for a pizza afterwards, if still speaking to one another - hopefully life won't imitate art.Basta (enough)."
" All of us have secrets
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,9,"Perfetti sconosciuti or Perfect Strangers is about a group of friends that are having a nice, random dinner until a quite unpleasant and intriguing game comes to someone's mind. The game gets more and more interesting as the time goes by because they are starting to wonder if they know who their friends (and partners) really are.The concept of the movie is so simple and makes it easy to watch and follow the plot. What I actually liked most is that you start thinking how much of yourself is there to reveal and how much could you be able to reveal to someone you have allegedly known your whole life. The truth is that people get anxious when you start browsing their mobile phones or computers without their control. Even if they maybe don't hide anything, they always believe there is a chance that something doubtful or too personal could be found. But we generally don't think about it because it is wrong for someone to stick his nose in our personal data shelter.Anyway, the whole point is well interpreted throughout the movie. I started to wonder how bad that game could go. Combined with a likable Italian humor, this movie guarantees a perfect movie night. Just hope that people with whom you are watching it don't get similar ideas!"
" A very real current film without unnecessary bells & whistles
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,8,"The film depicts a normal dinner party. A group of middle-aged friends eat and drink together discussing how smartphones influence our everyday life. As they all agree they have nothing to hide they decide to play a game that will put their beliefs and friendships to test.The film is strong on individual performances, a facetious script and honest character building.Recommended!"
" An entertaining and voyeuristic peek into the black-box of secrets, the iPhone.
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,7,"A lot of water has passed under the bridge since The Big Chill (1983). It was the movie that immortalised the 'gathering of old school friends' as a narrative premise for revealing hidden truths and showing that friendship is the first casualty of honesty. The Italian comedy of manners Perfect Strangers (2016) follows this path but updates it with themes of technological intrusion, marital hypocrisy and sexuality closets. The result is a cross between a squirm-in-your-seat farce and a reality TV show where everyone goes home alone.Seven friends gather for a dinner party and amidst the bonhomie over drinks friction points appear in every relationship. As often happens in long-term friendships, they know enough about each other to stay in touch but know too much for comfort. Three are married couples at various points on the harmony scale and the single divorcée has come alone despite expectations that the group will meet the new girlfriend. The hostess Eva, a therapist, chats about iPhones as a modern day black box full of secrets kept from partners. She suddenly suggests a party game where everyone puts their phones on the table to share every incoming call and message to show that they have nothing to hide. Once this premise is locked in, the consequences are funny, chaotic and predictable.After a heavy breathing prank call from a friend in the kitchen, this Russian roulette of secrets gets more and more serious and the eye movements around the table more jittery. The hostess is the first to be embarrassed when a message reveals she is having her ""boobs done"" and another friend is caught out scheming to move her mother-in-law into a nursing home. One by one, the secrets tumble out including marital infidelities and gay outings. The dialogue-rich script and the well- paced story is propelled entirely by the tension of not knowing what will be revealed next.This is intelligent humour for contemporary times with the ever-dwindling gap between the public and the private. The gags and one-liners are fast and cutting to capture the kind of things that friends might think while sober and voice out when not. For audiences who do not speak Italian, the dialogue is delivered at Mediterranean speed and the sub-titles undoubtedly miss nuance. The escalation of disclosures and amplification of impact produces a stage play-like atmosphere reminiscent of a French farce gone wild. But it all adds to the chaos as the fabric of friendship is torn asunder in what is an entertaining if voyeuristic over-the-fence look at how others live their lives."
