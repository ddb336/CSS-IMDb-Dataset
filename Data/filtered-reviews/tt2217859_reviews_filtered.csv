" What is really going on here...
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,5,"This is a very weird, disquieting, perplexing film and its definitely is not for everyone. It has two of the most unique young American actors in the cast (Eisenberg and Druid) and both of them bring their trademark queasiness and angst to their roles. As the story unfold, we feel like there is something unspoken underlying everything that happens. We keep waiting for the titular bomb to drop and when it does, we're not really allowed to see it. We're lead to believe that the secret here is that the mother (Huppert) committed suicide but there is no real evidence of that. There's just this vague notion that maybe that is what happened.But I think there is a hidden meaning in the end, the dream Conrad has. There is a real strange relationship between the mother and her elder son. She visits him at college and ends up sleeping in his bed. Then Conrad has a dream where the mother brings a baby (an old man) to meet the family and it is said that the baby is Jonah's, her son's, child. I think the real secret is that Conrad is Jonah's son. There age difference implies that it is possible - and every subtle hint in this film leads to that conclusion...Perhaps the article in the paper suggests that her death is a suicide but the men in this family knows why she commits suicide - why she leaves home when she can - and is completely ill at ease when she is home...If this is truly what is being suggested - it is the most subtle suggestion in all of cinematic history... and it is done perfectly. But if this is wrong... then the movie is rather lame and less distressful. If Conrad isn't Jonah's son, then this is just a radically inferior version of The Ice Storm."
" An austeric drama
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,8,"I am on a Jesse Eisenberg re-binge, and this one I hadn't watched earlier..
The character writing was especially for the father and Comrad was great..
Movie has some great visuals..
A very realistic touch..
Jesse is not in the lead, but a treat for his fans..
The story is nothing extraordinary, but the execution and character writing is..
I loved it..
And I'd suggest you to give it a shot, especially if you were a quiet, introverted kid during high school, who had stuffed up emotions and tough time with family, you would highly relate"
" Less strong than bombs
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,6,"Another of those stylized films that is afraid of melodrama, about the grief of a father and his two sons on the occasion of an exhibition organized in honor of the wife and mother, a famous war photographer, killed in a car crash two years earlier .Directed by Norwegian Joachim Trier. With Isabelle Huppert making faces as a hook and figurehead in the role of the mother photographer, Gabriel Byrne as a widower, former actor and teacher, Jesse Eisenberg, as the eldest son, recent father but with doubts, Devin Druid as the unbearable youngest son isolated with his father and Amy Ryan, as the father's colleague and lover, perhaps the only character who evokes some empathy.While the ghost of the mother and her motivations flies over as an intrigue, everything about the characters (and the film) is so listless and measured that, frankly, nothing happens. (reminds me of that Manchester by the Sea style)Nor does the broken temporal structure with flashbacks help to create any dramatic progression."
" Mubi Selection
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,8,"Cannes Film Festival - 2015
Stockholm International Film Festival -2015
Festival du Nouveau Cin√©ma - 2015
Ghent Film Festival - 2015Isabelle Huppert is only but a dream in this melancholia story of a widowed father played by the wonderful Gabriel Byrne and his two sons. All dealing with grief in their own way.What happens when you take the mother the core out of the equation, out of the family?Joachim Trier does a fantastic job telling that tale, blending infidelity, imagination and the loss of hope of what will never be again."
" Good story line, crappy directing and editing
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,1,"Movie had potential with good writing, but the directing sucked a camels butt, story line was all over the place, movie was bouncing from scene to scene made it hard to understand and stay with characters
Decent acting but this is another reminder that editing a movie and directing is can make a film or break it, in this case it broke it..p.s crappy ending that left you confused, wasted 2+ hour just to get aggravated"
" Fantastic.
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,10,"Congratulations Mr. Trier and to the cast.
What a great story. It was a movie to watch tonight.
I could relate to the ""drama"" in these peoples lives.English is not my first language so i wish you understood norwegian , ha-ha...No, really...the title is very accurate for the movie...The inner noise can surely
be louder than bombs. It took me back to the solitude in my high-school, the
resentment against the high-school , the ""happy"" people, the secret love for the girl in my class.Thank you, and thank you.... happy that i found your movie in city-library.All best."
" Trier is a wizard of the screen, always beautiful films.
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,7,"Trier's english debut didn't surprise me, okay, maybe absence of Anders Danielsen Lie is something unusual for this director. Anyway, this story of searching for truth while getting into more and more lies shows, again, that Trier in his movies is not looking for a ""Big Truth"", but for the real emotions. Superb Eisenberg and Druid. Oh, I think that every movie needs a dance scene. This one had it. And it's beautiful."
" Louder Than Bombs might not be loud or explosive, but it certainly packs a punch.
",2018-02-24 00:00:00,7,"Another quiet indie drama that went under the radar, its unfortunate really because these low key films have some of the best cinematography out there. A famous modern war photographer, who uses pictures of conflict to express the damage of warfare, is killed in a car accident. The remaining family members must go through her unpublished work for a final article, to which becomes more of a personal journey for them all. Essentially it's another drama about grief, an all too familiar concept that is completely saturated with depressing dramas. This one is no different, but it's execution sets it apart from the basic example. Each family member goes through grief in their own different way. The husband remains tranquil and yearns to communicate more with his sons. The eldest son cheats on his wife with his ex-girlfriend. The youngest son shuts himself off from the world in solitude, continually playing video games and being apart from others. It didn't feel artificial, in fact I thought these characters were perhaps some of the most realistic I've seen in a drama of this type for quite some time. Then we find out that the wife also isn't exactly perfect, and so we have ourselves a broken imperfect family. The problem with that, it's not exactly exciting. Various scenes of just characters staring into the distance as internal narration takes over. A decision that perhaps over stylised the narrative, to a point where it felt too glossy and superficial. I wanted the plot to delve deeper into their emotions, a few more outbursts and some powerhouse scenes. Alas, the tone remained calm throughout which I can also appreciate. Director Trier does utilise a competent cast to deliver the emotional captivation. Huppert's small screen time felt everlasting. Eisenberg gave another understated performance. Druid surprisingly held the film together. A novelistic approach that just can't quite reach the heights of sophistication."
" A portrait of grief
",2017-10-04 00:00:00,5,"Louder than Bombs is a frustrating movie because it's so beautifully edited and directed but everything about it just falls flat. The film is about the Reeds, a family made up of a father and his two sons, one an adult starting his own family, the other a teen, who are all coping with the loss of the mother of the family Isabelle, a war photographer who died 4 years earlier. The events in the film are triggered because a retrospective of Isabelle's work is being put on and a friend and journalist writing an article regarding her life warns Isabelle's widow that he plans to be ""honest"" about the way she died implying that the car crash she died in might not have been accidental after all. The rest of the film follows these three men as they stumble around their lives, reminiscing about the Isabelle they knew and didn't know and struggling to move forward. It's a very watchable film, but it's also somehow not enough. The struggles of the film feel self-indulgent and it's one of those films where women exist only to be lusted over or listen sympathetically to the men as they talk about their problems and throw tantrums. Even legendary actress Isabelle Huppert, as the ghost that haunts the family, doesn't get much to chew on. The worst part is that it's a movie that isn't easy to write off entirely. The youngest son is a bit of a writer and the way his text is layered over with images leads to some beautiful editing and some true movie magic. It's just a shame that these great moments don't quite live up to what they could have been if they had had strong emotion to back them up."
" Poignant moments.
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,8,"Good films capture the essence of life, of growing up, the pain, the exclusion, the dynamics that are often felt, and less explored.I shared the tears of Conrad during the telling ""Walk with Melanie"" part in which the self reflection recognizes, in the moment, a special time with an adored person that will never come to anything. The tears flowing perhaps at recognition of that, or that the person is not the idol you make them to appear and that its all for not anyway. Who hasn't had an experience like that during a boyhood crush? The interaction between the brothers is breathtaking and the advice not to share the letter is classic indication of love, of the older brother understanding the pain and not wanting Conrad to further inure his pain.Strangely though the minutes with Melanie ends up being a tonic for Conrad in which he could move through his pain, even obtain reassurance that it was nice that Melanie could even think that Tuesday lunch would be nice with him. Its touching too in that it is obvious that Conrad, and Jonah are intellects and the girl, in reality, through the described misplaced High School hierarchy, probably looks up to Conrad as well albeit this can't be communicated within the high school corridors of cool.I comment extensively on the Walk with Melanie part of the movie because it is one of the classic unsequestered young love moments captured in modern film. So eloquent even within the context of what the sadand tenuous connection was. Walking an inebriated girl home and there being no other connection. With the soundtrack grabbing hold at that exact moment and reprised in the closing credits with the namesake ""louder than bombs"" perfectly capturing the emotion of the film. The whole film is mesmerizing albeit I felt the mother, played by Isabel Huppert was weak. Perhaps because she was so unlikable. The movie did not accurately or meaningfully depict how a women would chose war correspondence over caring for her children or how and why that would occur. Nor did it explain a women falling for a despicably played Richard (David Straithairn) who I have liked in films but who played an unlikable character in this one. Plus that she is married to Gabriel Byrne. One has to suspend belief to believe that somebody would prefer Straithairn over Byrne. Or that his children would find him so unlikable. Perhaps some casting mistakes but the brothers, and Melanie, and the teacher were letter perfect casting."
" Thoroughly enjoyed it
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,8,"Being a photographer, and having huge respect for photojournalism (and good movie's about photojournalists such as ""The Bang Bang Club"" - must watch it!) I felt somewhat inclined to watch this movie when coming across it by chance. Although the movie speaks little of photojournalism, what is said regarding the mothers job as a photojournalist is in my opinion, quite profound. What I think the movie is really about, in broad terms, is about family relationships and dealing with issues as time passes and things change within a family, and I think the way that this theme is conducted throughout is natural and relatable. I also really enjoyed the cinematography and thought the movie was shot very well, again with a very natural feel to it, although the style of the movie is not extremely unique (not necessarily a bad thing just a comment) Overall I think it was a great film, and would like to see what else this director has been involved in!"
" concentrate on the kid
",2017-08-11 00:00:00,6,Renown war photographer Isabelle Reed (Isabelle Huppert) died close to home in a car crash. Her work is getting an exhibit with work partner Richard (David Strathairn). Her older son Jonah (Jesse Eisenberg) returns home to help after having a new baby. Her younger son Conrad (Devin Druid) is introverted and has a crush on classmate Melanie (Ruby Jerins). Conrad is furious when he discovers his father (Gabriel Byrne)'s new fling with his teacher Hannah (Amy Ryan). The family struggles to come to terms with their loss and their differing memories of Isabelle.Norwegian filmmaker Joachim Trier creates a compelling dysfunctional family. The movie would probably work better concentrating on Conrad as a coming-of-age story. It may not help that Druid is not the most accomplished actor. The allure of following the great adult actors is too much for Trier. These are interesting characters if only he could harness them better visually and narratively.
" Slow, pretentious, boring mess - too many long pauses.
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,1,"Attracted by a good cast, Gabriel Byrne, Isabelle Huppert, David Strathairn, I checked this film out of the library. Not since 'Elivra Madigan' in the 60's have I endured such a boring film. After 20 minutes of suffering through long pauses and slow responses between characters speaking to each other, I fast forwarded to the end. Not only did the pauses of at least two seconds, which in a conversation is an eternity, especially as one character is totally immobile while the other fiddles with her hair, grimaces, puts her hand up to her mouth, lips tremble and whatever else she learned at the school of bad acting.I enjoy foreign language films and am happy with a slow pace if it engrosses me, but this did not hold my attention for even five minutes. If they had trimmed the conversational pauses, and the characters standing stock still for no reason, they could have lopped an hour off the film, or at least filled in more dialog. I should have been warned by the blurb on the box which spoke of the dysfunctional family of a deceased woman each trying to reconcile their emotions and deal with her death in their own way. I will know better next time. When did all this hair chewing, hand wringing, voice trembling and verbal stumbling, or rigid immobility, begin to pass for acting? I watch films of the 40's and 50's which had none of this, yet it seems everywhere these days. The high school girl unable to read words of more than one syllable (or was it more than three letters) without stumbling as the camera stayed on her for five minutes. Was this a school for developmentally handicapped teenagers? The other thing which annoyed the heck out of me, but this may be my age, was the apologetic father who let his younger son get away with foul mouthed insolence when he should have smacked that out of him a long time ago. It was not Gene's fault that his son was a brat. I never want to see another film where parents take the blame for the bad behavior of their children.My overall opinion: a pretentious time waster."
" Louder Than Bombs, Blows.
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,5,"No likable characters, or at least, all the male characters - Jonah, Gene and Conrad, which were the leads really, are really not all that personable.The characters are somewhat irritating, and their inability to communicate with each other extends all the way past the fourth wall, to the viewer.It's very difficult to feel empathy for an adulterer, a disrespectful weirdo and a spineless man. Sympathy maybe, but, empathy was just too arduous.And sure, Louder Than Bombs was attempting a portrayal of raw and actual real life experience in front of a camera... But sadly, real life can be quite boring to watch.I do however like that Jonah gave Conrad the advice he gave him about his (Conrad) love interest, that Conrad narrated that his love interest would forget about him the next day after their early morning walk and that Gene and Hannah's relationship ended the way it did, because all of that, like it or not, is usually how life turns out for the average man, and Louder Than Bombs didn't uncharacteristically abandon that sad truth.But, this film was a bit taxing, though, it had all the best intentions. 5/10."
" Confusing
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,3,"I found it very hard to follow this movie. Slow moving, out of sync. Who is that character? Is it past or present? I fast forwarded through a lot of scenes that were not necessary to film like long walks and drives. The youngest son, was he ever told of his mom's suicide? Was it a suicide? It made me feel uncomfortable throughout."
