" HATE & MALICE!
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,5,"Good performances by all, but a dreadful story of lies, deceipt and selfishness!"
" Getting better
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,7,"Starts slowly, introducing too many characters at once, but getting better and funnier, especially when frederica's ""fianc√©"" gets introduced. Still not great though"
" Mindless entertainment. EXCELLENTE
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,10,"Kate Beckinsale is smoothly, utterly wicked . LoL!!!! High Definition eyecandy.
James Fleet and Stephen Fry add authenticity by looking ""English"".
Did Jane Austen really write this fox sitcomlike lowbrow stuff? Wow. :)"
" Love & Friendship
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,6,Whit Stillman adapts Jane Austen's novella Lady Susan. Rather than a comedy of manners and matchmaking. This is better viewed as a social romp of survival and social climbing.Lady Susan (Kate Beckinsale) is a relatively young impoverished widow. She wanders about living house to house of various friends and relatives. A social flirt who is having an affair with Lord Manwaring but thrown out when his wife suspects.Now moving into her brother in law's house. Lady Susan is looking for a social match for her daughter Frederica (Morfydd Clark) and maybe one for herself.The dimwitted baronet with a good income Sir James Martin is suitable for Frederica but she doesn't want him. Frederica does have an eye for someone Lady Susan is interested in.Performed with gusto by Kate Beckinsale. It needed to be more bawdier than prim. More Tom Jones than Emma. The humour and satire does not always cut through.It moves along nicely with music in the style of Michael Nyman.
" Underrated witty film
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,10,"Sharp dialogue, good production. Key actors deliver a gloriously self-interested portrayal of the plight of unattached women, navigating the financial complexities of matrimony."
" over-reaching
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,5,"Adapting Austen probably appears to screenwriters like falling off a log; but you are bound to go wrong if you think you can write dialogue like hers, only better. In this case the director, writing his own screenplay, has produced over-elaborate semi-gibberish which, whilst a worthy enough representative of the blowhard American literary tradition, does not resemble either Jane Austen's light epigrammatic style or the speech of any real person alive or dead. It's a style which, in reaching for historical authenticity while being littered with obvious neologisms, is a constant irritation.The inaccuracy extends to obviously ludicrous things like characters not knowing how many Commandments there are, or who Solomon was. It's as though the film can't decide whether it's a 'straight' version or a Bleak Expectations-style spoof, with the usual consequence of falling between two stools.In truth it's a convoluted, episodic story and with dialogue like that it's not easy to follow - which is no doubt why they had the idea of captioning the characters. It's a shame because Kate Beckinsale turns in one of her best performances and, with better dialogue and clearer handling, this could have been a really good satirical comedy."
" The Mien Engaging
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,7,"Kate Beckinsale trades in her latex for hats and crinolines to take on Jane Austen in this moderately tongue-in-cheek adaptation of her posthumously-published novella in which pert modern misses Beckinsale & Sevigny dress up in a succession of magnificent period creations and sit about talking (and talking) about, well, love and friendship rather as Whit Stillman's characters used to do in twentieth century Manhattan.It's all agreeable and good-looking, although the settings feel totally unlived in and everybody sounds as if they're simply reciting dialogue they've memorised in advance. Which of course they have."
" Drainage
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,2,"Really wanted to like this, I love Kate Beckinsale but she took a bad left turn with this one. The writing/dialogue were just plain bad. Worst Jane Austen adaptation I've seen."
" Cunning and Manipulative
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,8,"As a man of advanced age and small fortune who is unlikely to ever again put himself in the great game of love, I delight in this witty play.
All the male characters are fools, of different colours while all the female are cunning. To be good-hearted it is necessary to be comfortably settled, it seems.
Lady Susan Vernon's last words sum it up:
""My daughter has shown herself
to be cunning and manipulative.
I couldn't be more pleased.
A Vernon will never go hungry."""
" Golden threads in a tattered rag
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,7,"A scheming widow flees to the English countryside to settle the marriage prospects of her family.Some superb characters and performances in a patchy production. Lady Susan has an interesting and sophisticated view of life, which is delivered in fine style by the lead actress: after furiously rebuking a gent for daring to approach her, she breezily excuses herself - ""Of course I know him! I would never address a stranger in such fashion."" But even more enjoyable is the unsquashable dunderhead, Sir James - the director makes great demands with extended scenes in which it must have been difficult to sustain the delicate humour, but the actor pulls it off brilliantly. Also a lovely scene with the de Courcy grandparents, as he tries to read her a letter.On the debit side, the American exile isn't quite right - a great actress for close-ups, but here (as usual) she's just a sidekick, and can't bring the proper deviousness to her role. And the scene with her husband felt like the actors weren't sure it was working. And, in general, the camera or editing often seems misplaced in two-shots and over the shoulders.There are big problems with the story, and about halfway through I was puzzled by a couple of scenes that seemed to refer to ghost events I didn't recall. And the resolution is frivolous, a disappointment after Lady Susan's musings on loyalty and emotion. I understand this is an early work by the great novelist, but I don't see why the story couldn't have been gussied up in the screenplay.Another thing - clearly a great deal of compression in the writing and editing, as the opening titles hit us with a tidal wave of character intros, with the following scene an extreme example of entering late and leaving early. Fine, but the pace over the first ten minutes had me holding on by my fingernails as I tried to figure out what was happening to whom. It felt like everyone was frantic with worry over the slim running time.The Irish locations are just right for the Georgian period. Music all chamber orchestra Baroque. Photography is fine, but doesn't balance out the threadbare direction and editing.Overall: golden threads in a tattered rag."
" Kate Beckinsale Can't Act
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,4,"Saw this on the BBC a few days ago and I was genuinely suprised to find out that this is a film and not a made for TV drama.
I had never seen Kate Beckinsale in anything before but she was just an awful actress. I have seen better performances in school plays and amateur dramatic performances. This poor performance basically ruined anything good about the film.
Yeah, SHOCKER of a film."
" OK version of an early, thin, Austen short story
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,6,"The biggest challenge facing this is that Jane Austen's novella ""Lady Susan"" is short and relatively condensed (if such an accusation could ever be levelled against this wordy author), so trying to spin it out for an hour and half was always going to be a hard task. It's presented in a very staccato fashion - short scenes peppered with lovely orchestral themes and scenes of English country life/houses that do very little to sustain the rather wilting narrative featuring the scheming ""Lady Susan"" (Kate Beckinsale) who is determined to augment her recent widowhood by finding a rich husband for her daughter ""Frederica"" (Morfydd Clark) and, of course for her self. Snag is, she has a wee bit of a reputation so is treated with an hefty dose of scepticism amongst the elite with whom she and her daughter mingle. Finally alighting at Churchill - the stately pile of her brother-in-law, and much to the chagrin of his wife, she begins a cat and mouse game, toying with the affections of the young ""Reginald DeCourcy"" (Xavier Samuel). The arrival of her daughter's unwanted suitor, the well meaning but slightly hapless ""Sir James Martin"" (Tom Bennett) upsets her plans a smidge and the plot thickens.... Bennett has all the best scenes, and laughs - the rest of it is a rather heavily over-staged costume drama, lacking much of substance and with an inevitability about it that the cast can do little to complicate. Looks great, costumes etc., but it's really a film for Austen fans - I fear the rest of us will find nothing new here."
" Enjoyable
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,9,I really enjoyed this film. Quite unexpected really as I thought it would be one for my wife. We will watch it again sometime. Feel good factor!
" I have tried....but no!
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,4,"I have watched Love & Friendship 5 times now ; the first 2 times in the cinema ( including a preview in Amsterdam with director Whit Stillman present) and was dissapointed. As a huge Austen-fan (books & film/tv-adaptations) I had high expectations about L&F. I always want to give new ones at least a chance and not judge beforehand. Sometimes watching it 2 or 3 times when I'm in doubt ,usually helps. I always find myself enjoy watching different versions on dvd and not compare them too hard with each other or the books. But it did not help for this adaptation.
Lately I watched again at home and the costumes/filmlocations is wonderful to look at. But I am used to English humor and their
sharp timing and it just isn't there. The only exception is Tom Bennett as James Martin, the only character that made me laugh. Kate Bekinsale just rattles all her lines like she's reading a telephonebook while catching a train, dissappointing! Stephen Fry as Mr.Johnson had only a few sharp and very funny lines but again ;English timing was not there ;such a shame. If I was the director I would have given the well-loved names like Stephen Fry,James Fleet and for instance Jemma Redgrave more space in the film and make use of their tremendous experience.
So ; only 4 stars for the costumes and the filmlocations."
" Delicious satire of Austen period pieces
",2020-03-01 00:00:00,9,Hilarious and sharp satire - great performances by all.
" Jane Austin in the 21st Century (No Spoilers)
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,5,"I suppose this one can be termed ""based on the works of Jane Austin"" since it is not, in fact, an accurate representation of the original book (which is fairly short and REALLY a funny little read-through).Credit goes more to overall casting and costume/set design, which is also a little off for the timeframe of Jane Austin's work, but very nice in many ways.The film only aired in a small smattering of theaters and leaves actual Austin fans with a good deal of disappointment."
" Beautifully Packaged Narcissism: Susan.
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,7,"Love and friendship?
I gave this 7 stars because it was entertaining, beautiful, ostentatious, and lacking. Had some tweaks been made, this would have rated much higher!
The setting, countryside, London scenes, COSTUMES, props, horses, hair and make-up give it an entertainment value that helps to compensate for the hard-to-follow storyline, and impish manner in which this great story is portrayed.
It could have been written by Oscar Wilde, and could have been as entertaining as ""The Importance of Being Earnest"", had some variances been made.
I WILL watch this again, and probably again because I am an hopeless Anglophile and an Austen bibliophile.
A light and entertaining way to spend a winter evening.
This is in no way a drama, as labeled on Amazon. It will make you angry and make you laugh. One cannot be indifferent to ""Susan"" aka Love & Friendship."
" Could have benefitted from better post-production
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,3,"Some of the costumes (particularly Beckinsale's) seemed at least a few decades too modern for 1790. The audio and video were very out-of-sync. For most of the movie, I was convinced that the actors were speaking a foreign language instead of English because the audio was that far off from the movement of the actors' lips. There were even times I could hear a character speak when their lips weren't moving at all."
" Utter garbage.
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,1,I don't know where to begin... not one redeeming feature. Oh and by the way it's AustEn. Not Austin !
" Ugh.......
",2019-10-03 00:00:00,4,"You know those movies where you watch for the first 15 minutes and think this has got to get better soon? Then you wait another 10-15 more and realize.... it's not going to. I cut it off then. Started to put me to sleep. And I love period pieces, too!"
" A delightful Jane Austin adaptation
",2019-08-05 00:00:00,8,"This film, based on Jane Austin's novella 'Lady Susan' is centred on Widow Lady Susan Vernon. She is the subject of gossip amongst polite society so goes to stay with her in-laws at Churchill House. She is keen to find wealthy husbands for herself and her daughter Frederica, who is expelled from school shortly after Lady Susan arrives at Churchill. Lady Susan tries to arrange for her daughter to marry the wealthy but rather dim Sir James Martin; a prospect which Frederica is not keen on. Meanwhile Lady Susan befriends Reginald DeCourcy; something his father strongly disapproves of. As the story progresses Lady Susan continues to scheme but truths will be revealed and things won't quite go as planned.Not having read the novella I can't comment on how accurate an adaptation this is. I can though say that I really enjoyed this film. It is definitely very knowing... as each character is introduced a brief description lets us know what they will be like. There is plenty of humour... much of it provided by Sir James Martin; his musings on the 'Twelve Commandments' was laugh-out-loud hilarious... Tom Bennett was great in the role. Kate Beckinsale is impressive as Lady Susan; a delight as she tries to manipulate those around her. The rest of the cast, which includes many familiar faces is solid too. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of other Austin adaptations and costume dramas in general."
" Film and literature as bickering cousins.
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,10,"I was constantly aware of its mechanization of cinema as the forms meeting, and how film both succeeds and fails literature. The film observes its own effect. Seeing as these are novels so have to interface via cinematic means and Austen is not right for cinema since it's this indulgence of thoughts, dilemmas, gossip, in a beautiful and heightened way. Meaning the effect of reading is indulging in secrets while theater only shows. So then to meet it is to meet the language not create some faux-cinema around it. Then this is probably the most pure Austen adaptation I recall, as it examines so carefully. What happens, for me, is I do not at all get nearly the same amount of pleasure hearing the beautiful dialogue as I do reading it. It doesn't scale at all. (A lot of writers learn this.) The achievement of the film then is something else reads and that's its careful staging and theater, the comic humor of these socialites; you sort of realize it was never because of the language to begin with, but the infectious energy and subversion of it, however the language serves it the energy reads the same creating viable parallel works that scrutinize and ponder ending up revealing the same treatise from a different angle, and it passes. That is sort of the essence of an adaptation, is to not adapt, as reverence always sinks a picture which is why trash novels make better films. ""Marriage last forever."" ""Not in my experience."""
" What's not to like
",2019-05-22 00:00:00,9,"I can't understand the poor ratings of this movie. It was delightful. Snooty folks must expect more from a Jane Austen adaptation. Well acted and directed, an enjoyable, well told story."
" ... what more can you ask for?
",2019-05-15 00:00:00,10,"I guess I love this genre. Jane Austen movies are so great. Period films with lots and lots of intrigue. Not to mention beautiful people wearing the coolest costumes. Very heavy in dialog, and acting. A movie based on story and performance rather than special effects. I loved it."
" This was a snooze
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,2,"Geesh. Where do I begin. I think the main problem with this film was direction followed by casting. The acting was so bla and everyone looked like they were acting and they were doing a very tired job of it. Even though I'm a Jane Austen fan, the plot was very flat and boring and slow moving. The actors spoke too fast or mumbled and It was really just a waste of an hour and a half. Not to mention there was no positive message- unless you want to celebrate manipulative, lying women who do anything for their own gain. It's not acceptable or men to act this way, but neither is it acceptable for women. The only exception I make in this case is if it is daring and entertaining. Try Dangerous Liaisons instead."
" Love & Friendship offers courtly romance through delectably exquisite dialogue.
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,7,"Austen's period work has nearly been fully adapted, but trust her novella 'Lady Susan' to be one of the most fulfilling costume dramas available. It's not a perfect swan song, but more a myriad of verses that make use of a delicious lexicon as if all the characters have consumed Thesauruses. The refreshingly delightful screenplay gives life to the typical costumes and Austen period setting, making it a pleasant Sunday afternoon drama. Lady Susan, a recent widow, calculatingly exploits herself and her daughter to secure financially stable husbands.First and foremost, period romances/dramas are not my cup of tea. Never have been, never will be. The critical acclaim somewhat attracted me to the feature, and I'm glad it did. Stillman's screenplay, dressing up Austen's original words, is assuredly perfect. A harmonious balance of character development, dry British wit and preposterous pompousness that gives life to the intricacies that Lady Susan carefully injects into these extensive families. Seriously. In particular Sir James' naive tomfoolery was incredibly hilarious, something as simple as assuring one's self that there are ""twelve commandments"" instead of ten, happened to make me laugh.The majority of the script wouldn't work without Beckinsale's stellar central performance. I could listen to her all day. She makes me want to whip out a Dictionary and envelop myself in Austen's vocabulary. Sublime. The supporting cast unfortunately became drowned by her excellence, especially Sevigny who was underused as ""The American"". Speaking of, the character introductions were supremely innovative and a nice detailed touch, harking back to those classic TV adaptations. In fact the entire film is shrouded in this sense of classicism, and really makes the drama feel authentic.From Stillman's direction to the gorgeous cinematography. The story itself isn't exactly the most involving, consistently switching between various families often felt perplexing and overcomplicated the narrative. But with a film title such as the pleasing Love & Friendship, it very much ticks all the boxes. There's love, there's friendship, and there's plenty of pleasantness to behold. Just give me more Lady Susan!"
" Austen and Stillman...a surprisingly mediocre collaboration
",2019-04-19 00:00:00,5,"I can't agree with the enthusiastic reviews of this film nor wholly agree with those that absolutely hate it. Put me right in the middle. The film captured my attention well enough but was ultimately unsatisfying.First of all, Chloe Sevigny seems out of place and while supplying the ""Friendship"" part of the title, has little to do except be a sounding board for Lady Susan. And Stephen Fry is WOEFULLY underutilized.Second of all, watching the film through the Austen lens will be disappointing (perhaps the Stillman lens works better). There are certainly funny bits (James Fleet reading a letter, Tom Bennett's idiocy, and Lady Susan's clever rationales for abhorrent behavior) but these are Stillman funny not Austen funny. And a Brit who doesn't know what peas are!? Yes, the scene is definitely hilarious but nonsensical.Finally, it's a superficial film. Even the poorest adaptations of Austen's significant works can't help but have some gravitas simply due to the ideas present in the novels. The source material here is weak (and Stillman doesn't seem to have added much heft to it). Having read the novella, I can assure you that, while having some clever lines, it is not too memorable. And the film, like the novella, presents few ideas about ""Love"" or ""Friendship."" (In addition, it's an epistolary novella which might explain why so much of the action seems to be reported rather than viewed.)The cast (with the exception of Sevigny) is charming and the film is well-acted. Beckinsale deserves the accolades she is receiving for her performance but ultimately deserves a better film in which to display her talents."
" This little known Jane Austen is a gem!
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,9,"I sincerely enjoyed this film. The film is quite clever and fun! Such that strong women and embershed in quick humor, it is a refreshing change. I laughed out loud at the lines that were spoken throughout the film. Save me from such a conniving mother! For those who love a fun story, this is for you. Perhaps if you are a purist, it may not suit your taste."
" Pleasant enough
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,6,"Love & Friendship feels like something you would find on the BBC while flipping through channels on a Saturday afternoon. It's pleasant enough, but there doesn't seem to be anything particularly special about it (except for Kate Beckinsale). I don't think I'll watch it again, but I'm glad I saw it."
" Incomprehensible English gobbledygook
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,2,"I love Jane Austin, but I could not follow this ""comedy"". While I get the idea, the premise, and the outcome, everything in between was guess work. I know they were speaking english through the entire movie, but it might as well have been french. How could any person born in the 2000,s follow this movie? How could anyone born in the 1990's follow this movie? How could anyone born in the 1980's follow this movie? I could sense the comedy and cant fault the actors, but the language left me baffled and clueless."
" Could have been a lot better.
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,4,"This is far from being the best adaptation of a Jane Austen novel.While there is a defined story line, it is often difficult to follow due to the way in which the action jumps from place to place with little or no explanation. This makes the film disjointed, something which is made worse by the tendency of some of the players to rush or mumble their words. Chloe Sevigny, as Lady Susan's friend and confidante, Alicia Johnson, is particularly guilty in this respect.The sets, costumes and general atmosphere are excellent although the production lacks any real impetus. The acting ranges from good to indifferent, some of the actors seeming to be doing little more than entering, reading their lines and then disappearing again. That said, Kate Beckinsale makes a fair fist of her leading role and Tom Bennett, as the excruciatingly awful Sir James Martin, is something of a scene stealer. However, the object of Lady Susan's enduring affection, Lord Manwaring, barely appears, which one could also wish of his wife who screeches and wails to no purpose and surely behaves in no way like a late 18th lady.Would I watch it again ? Perhaps, on a wet Wednesday in winter when there was nothing else to do, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it."
" Subtle Kate
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,7,"A witty script with Lady Susan deftly moving the other characters around seemingly to her will like chess pieces.
Susan is impeccably played by Kate Beckinsale with plenty other fine performances, standouts perhaps Chloe Sevigny and Tom Bennett.
A short and sweet treat."
" Charming
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,7,"In the 1790s, Lady Susan Vernon (Kate Beckinsale) is recently widowed. As this new marital status had reduced her status and wealth, she must depend on the hospitality of friends and relatives. Considering her devious charms (which contribute to an ongoing affair with a married man), this makes Susan's hosts rather hesitant to take her in - at least the female ones. The film is based on the short novel ""Lady Susan"" by Jane Austen.At first, it seems difficult to keep track of the many characters. Director Whit Stillman helps by providing introduction panels at the beginning which not only identify each character but sometimes provide some comical information about them. From there on, it gets easier and one can enjoy the ride of this witty and entertaining film.Two performances stand out. Beckinsale succeeds beautifully as a demon with charm and charisma to spare. Her deliveries of Austen's great lines are sharp indeed. The other great performance comes from Tom Bennett as a man whose ample financial means cannot compensate for his lack of grey matter. He steals every scene in which he appears especially the one involving a discussion of the Ten Commandments.With perfect costumes, set pieces, and other fine production values, this is rather an enjoyable film."
" Fantastic movie if it fits you, but it may not be right for everyone
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, so much that after my first screening I watched it day after day after day for about a week. It's funny, charming, and boasts beautiful costumes and scenery. The acting is stellar.On the other hand, this is an artsy flick, and so if you're not into that kind of thing then you probably won't like it. I did. But even I had to be in the right mood to really ""get"" it.Unfortunately, it's hard to know going into it how you're going to respond, whether you will like it or hate it, and so forth. I expected to be only mildly entertained and was delighted to be surprised with what I can only describe as a masterpiece of period art and comedy. But that's me, and I can definitely see how other people may not appreciate this film to the same degree.All I can say is, try it and see what you think. Many of you will fall in love with it, like I did, while many others will hate it for its pretensions. But it's a fine film and well worth a shot."
" Delightful adaptation of early comedy of manners from Jane Austen
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,9,"Love & Friendship is noted Indie director Whit Stillman's adaptation of Jane Austen's novella Lady Susan. The original manuscript was discovered among Austen's papers many years after her death and published as an unfinished work. The novella is written in the form of a series of letters written by the principal characters to one another, revealing the social mores of upper middle-class families set in late 18th century England. Stillman must be applauded for distilling the narrative (set in that different format of those series of letters) into a workable screenplay.The film can best be described as a comedy of manners. People in those times interacted with one another in a completely different manner than they do now. One can say that they were much more polite but despite the manners, the conversations were constantly infused with biting invective. The comedy stems from the all the back-stabbing and lack of moral principles that guide each character.Chief among the principle-less is Austen's protagonist, the master manipulator Lady Susan Vernon, played flawlessly by Kate Beckinsale. Lady Susan is a deliciously sympathetic character despite her lack of moral scruples. Guided by a desire for sexual self-satisfaction, the recent widow is way ahead of her time!When we first meet Lady Susan, she's just finished conducting an affair with the handsome Lord Manwaring, much to the chagrin of his heartbroken and jealous wife, Lady Manwaring. As a result, Lady Susan is forced to leave his estate and move in at Churchill, the home of her brother-in-law, Charles Vernon and his wife, Catherine Vernon (n√©e DeCourcy). Catherine's brother, Sir Reginald, makes no attempt to hide his contempt for Lady Susan, who already has a tarnished reputation in polite society.Lady Susan's confidante is Mrs. Johnson, a transplanted American whose husband has had business in the State of Connecticut (Mrs. Johnson's American origins is Stillman's invention, making her into a Tory sympathizer, no longer welcome in her native country). Mrs. Johnson hangs on the every word of her scheming friend, and encourages Lady Susan in her calculating machinations.Soon enough the principled Sir Reginald has fallen for the charms of the new Churchill houseguest but denies any deep affection for her to his father, describing those rumors as ""vile calumnies."" Lady Susan also has plans for her introverted daughter, Frederica, who has just run away from a boarding school where she's been quite unhappy. Frederica's mother compounds her unhappiness by matching her up with Sir James Martin, a wealthy landowner whom his peers regard as a complete fool. (Stillman explains during the documentary about the film included in the DVD extras that Tom Bennett, cast as Martin, improvised a great deal of dialogue, handily improving the part.)Despite Lady Susan's base motives, she manages to ""do the right thing"" which leads to ""all's well that ends well."" At the suggestion of Mrs. Johnson, she ditches Sir Reginald and pawns him off on her daughter, who immediately falls for the handsome rake. Meanwhile, she surreptitiously marries goofy Sir James Martin (while having her lover, Lord Manwaring, live with her and her new husband on the Martin estate!).Love & Friendship is a delightful adaptation of an early work of a master novelist. Stillman recreates the period with aplomb resulting in what one might term a picaresque romp! The film is a hoot, relevant today in depicting human foibles as it was back then."
" great disappointment.
",2018-01-26 00:00:00,3,"When I discovered that Austen's novel, Lady Susan, was finally adapted to the screen, I felt really happy, because is one of my favorite works by the author, and it is very underrated. When I've read the cast that would be in this film, i knew it was a dead cause before start to watching. I wished to be wrong, but I was right. It was so mediocre and it made the original plot so flat, so incoherent that at the end I was angry, really angry. The characters were reduced almost to extras (specially the Vernon family) and even Lady Susan became a weak character in this film ( Kate Backingsale was a poor choice, it felt like they were aiming Catherine Zetta Jones but only could pay for Backingsale). Lady Susan is originally seductive, smart, mean , very manipulative and with a strong presence. All the time in this movie she was just a mature good looking woman with terrible arguments to assure her fame. Sevigny was also a terrible choice, her acting was the worst! Her character was supposed to be as mean and manipulative as Susan Vernon, extremely frivolous, not only someone saying lines with barely no expression. The plot rushes in such a way that it makes impossible to believe in some of the characters choices and feelings and becomes completely boring after 20 minutes. It was a mess, i do not recommend this one, go read the book."
" Not Very Interesting
",2017-10-06 00:00:00,5,"Th.e actors seem to do a good enough job acting, but the story line is simply lacking. While the lead actress is attractive, her character is built around her ability to think quickly and use her words to twist situations to her benefit and to lie in amazing ways. The problem is her wording is confusing and her talking is all there is to her character--using her words in manipulative ways. The movie is somewhat boring. I also did not like that characters were introduced as they appeared in the movie, by listing their names and something about them, such as their relationship to someone. That seems to be another evidence that the movie was not written well enough to show the relationships in scenes."
" Average Period Drama
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,5,I always like Period drama. This movie is just average. It's just too fast and too many characters to follow. The old English language is a little hard to grasp. I admit that my English is not that good unfortunately. I would have to watch it again to fully appreciate what's going on.
" A let down
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,3,"I don't usually consider to leave midway through a film in the cinema, a lesson learned from ""Lucky Number Slevin"" (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425210) which, in case you haven't seen yet rush to do so.""Love & Friendship"" though, had me seriously thinking ""what am I doing here?"" halfway through. Heck, I am sure that even the film title was decided based on the fact that it's hard to understand what it's about.Early on, it is hard to follow, as it throws names and faces to you (in a cute, supposed-to-be-funny manner) and you eventually realize that you actually DO have to remember all these names and faces.The plot unravels very slowly: you soon have the impression that ""something will happen"". And it never does.In my humble opinion, Kate Beckinsale is not fit to play the cunning lady Susan. She is an elegant yet cute (if not hot) presence, that doesn't come through as a manipulative widow.All in all, I would say that transferring a novel to the big screen is not merely using nice costumes and scenery. Cinema is a different art - aiming to stimulate different feelings. It shouldn't feel like someone is reading dialogues to me."
" Anachronism
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,9,"Spoiler included possibly.I can't believe Austen had ever written Lady Susan such a character. This piece is different from any others of her work, romantic is minimal. There would be more about moral conflicts and real woman living situation apply to the film.This character, Lady Susan is fascinating, so charming in so many ways. She is beautiful, talkative, men just easily fall in love with her. She has a low moral standard, making lies, flirtatious and careless to her own daughter. However, I still was seduced by her although none of her morality can be count as a good quality. But I still admire her intelligent in so many ways.The movie makes me recall Macbeth by William Shakespeare. Macbeth's wife, Lady Macbeth is known as evil because of her anachronous ambition. She overpowered her husband in the beginning, yet unfortunately, she is not strong enough and became weak at the end. I still remember the line from Macbeth that what Lady Macbeth said she would have plucked her nipple out of a smile baby's mouth and smashed its brains out against a wall if she needs to do. She said such heartless words to Macbeth, tempted him to kill his king. But herself ends up of being scared and suicided in the story.However, Lady Susan is another story, she never regrets, she is fearless to make up a falsehood even it can be exposed in a minute. She always turns the bad to her good. Lady Susan is a wonderful strategist born in the wrong era. If she born in nowadays, I have no a doubt that she would be a billionaire.Men conquer women by conquering the world, while women conquer the world by conquering men. Who is master of the world among alls?"
" What a Waste of Talented People
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,1,"I'll be upfront. I am not a fan of Jane Austen. Her writing is emotional without being emotive (believe me, there is a difference) and her ""complex"" plots are just wasted words. This movie put all her bad habits on display and confirmed my opinion of Austen all over again. Women are made to look conniving, silly or vacuous and men just silly. Kate Beckinsale is a good actress but she couldn't save this mess. Besides she plays one of the most hateful mothers that ever stood on the planet. Difficult to make that role pleasing. Especially when she goes after an in-laws' son who is half her age but well- monied -- which is, of course, the point. Who cares whether her own daughter would be a better match?The retelling of the story is done -- perhaps for comical effect -- by occasionally stopping in a pose with captions explaining the moment ala the silent movies. Silent movies could be overwrought and Jane Austen practically invented the emotion so I can see the connection but it made everything even sillier.Eventually the movie ends with at least one couple married appropriately but you don't get to see how that comes about which is highly unsatisfying. But the movie ends and that's that. There's no denouement, nothing to tie up unresolved matters, nothing. Boom. The end. Truly the most anticlimactic ending ever. The only person who might enjoy ""Love and Friendship"" would be an absolutely rabid Austen fan, but they'd also have to be highly forgiving."
" Love & Friendship is one of Mr. Metropolitan's best
",2017-07-02 00:00:00,8,"What I got to say about ""Love & Friendship"" is a good movie full of amazing grace. ""It's a triumph and a delightful of a movie."" The performances by the cast is really good. ""Kate Beckinsale gives her best performance of her career."" Whit Stillman's directing is good alongside his adaptation of author Jane Austen's novel was pretty good for my opinion. The cinematography is good. The choreography is good. The score in this film was so breathtaking to listen to. Finally, the effects are good as well.So incredibly smart and very very funny. I love Jane Austen but this is so different to a lot of her more well known work; not necessarily better but definitely not worse. It feels as though some of the charismatic but conniving side characters she has in her novels have now become the main character. Lady Susan is definitely not a moral or always likable person but she is engaging and I did find myself rooting for her. Also it was beautifully filmed; the music created just the right atmosphere, the acting was superb. Overall I have only good things to say about this film, I adored it.Love & Friendship is a movie that truly deserves its rotten tomatoes score. ---Yidioo"
" Charming but unmemorable
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,6,"I have not read the Jane Austen novella this is based on but it was a nice simple movie that I don't think will remember a week from now. I really enjoyed the character introductions. They would show them with title cards as they stood outside the house. It seems like a simple thing but it was nice device that also gave you a little introduction to what the character might be like. The actual story is nothing of note. There's some romantic and marriage drama but the dialogue is fun throughout. Kate Beckinsale and Chlo√´ Sevigny play off each other well. Tom Bennett is enjoyable in this if only to see other characters react to him. All in all, I wouldn't make a point to watch this but if it shows up on TV it's worth a watch."
" Bland
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,4,(Flash Review)Hard to make an easy fun period piece with neat costumes and settings bland but they did it. The story was told through lightly comedic and typical period dialog yet the story was never moved along by other means. It would have been more effective if at least some of the story was told through visuals; making the user think and engage. The story is about a divorced woman who is visiting various estates to find a wealthy enough suitor for herself as well as her daughter. She has the look and the intelligence to work her charms. It was OK but never really funny and never really enthralling enough to make you care.
" Brilliant reconstitution
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,7,"The action takes place at an epoch where people of high society didn't work at all and lived on rents of their estates and property. They had therefore plenty of time to engage themselves in amorous intrigues, seduction attempts and flirtations to pass time leading a pleasant life. This movies shows that kind of atmosphere in an admirable way in terms of sceneries, situations, costumes, rich dialogues and the actors' and actresses' performances. The story in itself is quite trivial but can be pleasantly viewed by the onlooker since it is visually very agreeable. To sum it up the story tells us about a charming young widow who is trying to get a suitable rich husband for her daughter and finishes herself also entangled in some love courtship vicissitudes. There is a brilliant reconstitution and presentation of life and society of the upper classes at that time and that's all."
" Blah movie
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,3,"It's a movie that, as it starts, for my taste, it gets you out of it. That presentation of the characters so televised, I found it so unpleasant that I could no longer enter. It is also something that repeats constantly. Apart from that it is a film made to make a critic about a fact and an era and a way of life and for me it is as simple as what criticizes.I can not believe any actor. They are all very bad. None makes a mere good sequence.I have not stopped seeing shadows on the walls, even when they walk the actors are seen shadows. In addition to having a photograph of the most television. It has an ugly light.The direction is downright bad, he can not make anything believable, he does not know that he bores, he plans in a simple and ugly way.Music, even from that time, does not stick. It is very badly placed.With the great period films that there is this will not happen to the annals of the cinema"
" A rose by any other name... ?
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,8,"I was very pleased by this movie, it was simply lovely.I admit to being extremely surprised by Stephen Fry popping up on screen (I hadn't looked at the actor list prior to watching it). He was awesome, as usual, the only criticism I have of his inclusion was that he simply didn't have enough screen time...The one thing I simply don't understand is the name of the movie. Jame Austen wrote two main stories in her youth (all of these stories together are called her 'Juvenilia'). One was 'Lady Susan', the other 'Love and Friendship'. This movie is the story of 'Lady Susan', but it's called 'Love and Friendship'.It's like making a movie of 'Pride and Prejudice' and calling it 'Sense and Sensibility'. Other than that incredibly annoying point, it's a great movie and quite fun."
" A Dialogue-Driven, Occasionally Amusing, Snore-Fest
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,6,"Love & Friendship follows a woman who, after taking up temporary residence in her in-laws' house, attempts to marry her daughter off. The acting is all pretty good in this movie. The actors largely embody their characters and do a good job of presenting their lines in a believable, and on occasion humorous way. The humor itself is actually pretty decent. During the first bit some of the situations are somewhat laughable, and one character in particular is pretty funny too. He's like 21st century person trying to fit into this time period, and ends up over-speaking to the point of silliness, and it is rather amusing. However, the moment that character leaves the story plummets. It suddenly becomes completely boring, and with the lack of any intrigue caused by the plot up to this point, plus the fact that there isn't any more comedy, it transitions from a good movie to a lullaby. Overall 50 minutes of this movie are good, and 40 are an absolute drag. It's only 92 minutes long, so these are both big chunks. Only one part of this movie is actually good, and the rest is dull. In the end I really wouldn't recommend this movie. While it appears worthwhile at first, it divulges to a bore by the end."
" Well acted
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,9,"First of all, yes, I'm a big fan of Jane Austen and I truly felt this movie did justice to her writing. Kate Beckinsale gave a terrific performance, and she was deliciously mean and sexy through the whole story. The sets and locations were beautiful, they really transported you to the time period (along with the lush costumes and makeup. I felt the supporting cast did a very good portraying their characters but Kate Beckinsale kept all eyes on her. Hard to believe this is the same actress who goes and do Underworld when she is so good at actual acting; and not just being dangerously sexy. I did feel the movie was kept contained like a page inside a book. There was a bit more that could have been done to create a bigger world, but the budget was probably limited. Terrific movie."
" Ghastly
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,1,"Yes, you guessed it; all the decent bits are in the trailer and the other 1 hour and 29 minutes is garbage.This should have been fascinating and entertaining. However, unless you have extensive knowledge of the story you would be lost in seconds. Terribly acted, terribly edited with horrible, humourless music that made my skin crawl, the only thing that was worth the watch were the ridiculous and hilarious offerings of Martin.TOTALLY disjointed, Jane Austen wouldn't have even recognised her own story.Dressed up rubbish flouting how stupid the upper classes are on a good day, let alone a bad, and how Kate Beckinsale was possibly one of the last people I would ever have cast in this role which requires clever subtlety, nuance and sauciness. She gave it plain bread roll without any butter, let alone jam.Biggest waste of money on a movie in a while, for me. Rubbish."
" ""Barry Lyndon"" meets ""Dangerous Liasons""
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,6,"We have the coaches pulling up to palaces with Baroque music ala Barry Lyndon, and the scheming manipulators of Dangerous Liasons, but it doesn't work as well as either. We're supposed to admire and sympathize with Lady Susan, which causes a conflict with her unattractive actions and outlook. Granted, the only power a woman of that time and station could wield was on a personal level, but even so, she seems to cause pain for the joy of hurting. Then, for all her brilliance, she fails where her daughter succeeds. Accidentally pregnant by her lover while married to a buffoon, is that a victory? At least it made me want to read the book.There is some beautiful music, and the movie does eventually pull the viewer in, but plot gaps and fast pacing towards the end makes for an unsatisfying ending. As if they finished the movie with one eye on the clock."
