" A Good Spanish crime thriller.
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,6,"At the End of the Tunnel is a Spanish language crime thriller.

After receiving a bank notice to foreclose on his house, Jaqine decides to rent the upper floor of the house. A Mother and daughter live in rented accommodation on the top floor of the house.
One day an unusual noise on the wall of the basement of his house wakes Jaqine's skilled engineer. He realizes that the thieves are making a tunnel to rob the bank through her house, forgets his disabilities and joins in the robbery without their knowledge. Jaqine's attempt to accomplish their goal by deceiving the thieves and deceiving them is presented in a way full of many twists.
There are many moments in this Spanish film that will captivate the audience of a thriller movie."
" Dreadful
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,1,"Dumb, slow-witted, brainless, I can be here named it all the bad names of this movie and I will never finish, that how bad this movie is. How can a person come to my house and start demanding? If by the way, you are asking your self why I gave this movie a 1 because you gave it 10, then welcome to my word, that Is how I feel when a person gives 1 start to a movie that I gave 8, have a nice day!!!"
" Which door will you choose?
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,6,"At the End of the Tunnel is engaging, despite the lack of introduction and thin characterization.It works because the plot's interesting and there's a lot going on. Daughter Betty and dog Casimiro, go hand in hand in making up for some of that characterization, adding some heart. I'm not sure we're given enough for it to be suspenseful, but the ending's satisfactory. Joaquin's a paraplegic MacGyver or Bond, with balls of steel. You just knew somebody was going to eat those biscuits."
" A messy bank-heist thriller that intrigues to an extent! [+54%]
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,5,"If you look at it purely from a screenplay perspective, I wouldn't call this film amazing. Not even close. It tries to pull off a hotchpotch of Rear Window (in the beginning), a little bit of Panic Room, and a whole lotta Reservoir Dogs (in the third act). Leonardo Sbaraglia plays Joaquin, a widowed paraplegic living in a mansion with his aged dog Casimiro. He rents out the upper floor and terrace to a single mother Berta (a dashing Clara Lago, playing a stripper) and her daughter Betty.With the arrival of Berta in his house, Joaquin slowly begins to feel the warmth of a woman again. They slowly begin to display a liking for each other. But the film isn't interested in exploring this unlikely acquaintance much. Joaquin, while working in the basement overhears a plan (on the other side of the wall) being hatched by a gang of robbers to break into a bank next door. A twist arrives early on, but I was hoping director Rodrigo Grande (who is also writing) would capitalize on it. However, the film then turns into a bundle of absurd ideas.Grande compromises plot for thrills in the latter half. Things stop making much sense but what keeps the movie alive are its performances (even when its antagonists are one-note). If you ask me whether the thrills were clever enough to keep me engaged, I'd say yes (to an extent). I wonder how little Betty will cope with life after all the nastiness she witnesses in the film's final act. It's a mess indeed; one that may leave viewers reasonably satisfied but also one that's convenient."
" A subtle thriller
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,8,Loved it. Unpredictable... story grasp you till the end.
" Trivia (cigarette)
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,9,"In the garden, Joaquin is smoking and Betty arrives. He throws the almost whole cigarette on the floor, but by focusing it on the floor, the cigarette is almost finished."
" Unnecessary Dark
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,4,"A typical and well done, overall good thriller, with good production other than the terrible score, good acting, a beautiful woman (Clara Lago) and acceptable heist movie filled with plenty twists (more or less predictable, depending on the viewer). All the details on the kind of boring start pay off in the end. So, entertaining and fine movie.But, the unnecessary dark subplot (really bad) was literally worthless, made no impact in the story other than motivating one character to do something that it could've decided to do with better writing and different reasoning (or maybe not even doing and make the character ""go there""), forcing the plot with this disgusting and amateurish trick. A terrible and difficult problem is brought just to help the writers wrap the movie up. Terrible. Disgusting. And pathetic."
" Good surprise
",2019-08-11 00:00:00,9,A very good movie! You never expect to see such a good plot! Loved it!
" 2019-2-7
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,7,"I feel some pieces were missing which made the story not so complete, and also made the movie not so reasonable. Why was there a crashed car in the unmaintained backyard? Why did a computer engineer have sleeping drugs to inject? Why did the computer engineer have a jar of poisoned cookie or chocolate in the house? Why did Joaquin can just knock off the ground of the vault, but the bad guys need to put a bomb to break into the vault? .. The idea of the story was good. It would be perfect if the lost pieces are filled into the movie."

Director- Rodrigo Grande
Cast-Leonardo Sbaraglia,Clara LagoLanguage-Spanish
Thriller
Third Spanish thriller on the row and still in awe of their expertise in making thrillers absorbing and captivating.After watching namely ""The invisible guest"",""sleep tight"" I sort of developed an interest in exploring their filmography more.A physically handicapped person overhears a bank heist plan of some thugs residing in his basement.OH!u guessed it right,it sounds familiar to ""rear window"",yes it is grande's homage to the Hitchcock classic. The film is though obviously very flawed but on the other hand is very watchable.The exceptional camera work and the performance of the lead cast are the reasons to watch the film.The entire film is shot in a single house,intentionally happens at a dark atmosphere.i.e at night.The story is not tight and very predictable.If you are going to watch the film for a wholesome experience you will not either be disappointed or be overjoyed.The plot has nothing new but the style of approach is unique and commendable.The film is mediocre if compared to the other spanish flicks mentioned earlier but as I already said is watchable.The films lacks the pace and is slightly long to watch for."
" Weak heist movie
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,3,"Script by director Rodrigo Grande is so full of holes that the viewer's suspension-of- disbelief capacity is used up in the first few minutes. The always reliable Leonardo Sbaraglia manages to make something out of his character Joaquín, a paraplegic with a disconcerting ability to do heavy digging and crawl in tunnels, but all the other characters are built of tired clichés such as the heavies played by Pablo Echarri and Federico Luppi and the temptress in charge of Clara Lago. The heist planned by Joaquín is surely one the most sure-to-fail in movie history. Grande's direction is fluid, cinematography by Felix Monti is very good and the sets are atmospheric, but the movie is terminally weighted down by the script. A miss."
" Not all the plans are foolproof.
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,7,"Not quite what I was looking for, but still I had a nice time watching it. This is an Argentine crime-thriller. Minimal cast film and entirely shot a building and its surroundings. Literally, it was always a dark atmosphere, like it all happened at night time. The opening parts were intentional as everything deliberately put together for a quick start. It was not a matter of cliché, but knowing how all these stories begin, they did not waste time for all the details. Just the glances at related stuffs revealed all the necessary details, like unmaintained backyard, crashed car, photographs et cetera, would tell the story all you wanted to know. Even though the film ran for two hours.So you might think they filled entire film with a tight plot, but that's not what really happened. Watching a film over that long was the tricky part, because there's no significant change in the narration in the first half, everything was in the following half. This is the story of a paraplegic computer engineer who is living alone in his house, but most of his time he spends at the basement working with computers. He was not as mysterious as he looked at the first glance. You will know him well with the progression of the story. Not from the past, but moving forward, and his intentions.It's about the time a single mother and her young daughter come asking him the room as they saw the rental signboard placed outside. It all happens suddenly where she moves in in the next few hours. As staying together, there's no proper connection was made between them, her attempts does not bring any positive. As the days go by, he discovers some gang is planning a heist in the next building. Now all his focus come into it and it's time to decide how to deal it, and once he did, his plans and its executions are what takes the centre stage in the remaining narration.❝In the end no matter how organised your plan is, it always depends on either a girl or luck.❞You probably would make a couple of guesses how it's all going to shape up, in particular how the finale sets up. So it is not that suspense if you think it would be. All the heist films you have seen in your life would make it easier for you to have many perspectives, whenever there comes a twist or turn. The bad part was the characters. All the film characters were clichéd. Like every weakness, strength is for a reason and those were not protected well for revealing it in the later parts. So concentrate every scene, even a small scene without ignoring. They all come into play in the crucial segment.It was something like a well known story and character pattern, except the settings, which kind of gives a fresh look for the product. The fist one hour was too slow, no exciting developments. It's all between two groups, one was the criminal gang with a major plan in their hand and the second was a family, well, it was almost like a family in the next door. All the events happen separately, but once the contact was made in the final act, the slow drama turns a fast paced thriller.But again, it compromises in the confrontation part. If you are going to expect a big face-off after what it all were developed in the earlier section, that's a pretty disappointment. But still it is a good film to watch once. Not a silly film on the overall, a theme like this to design takes quite a brain, though not a genius film and it was pretty neatly done. Especially the kind of audience they were aiming for, is not particular anyone, but mostly everybody.Whatever the characters were, the cast was excellent. They all performed their parts accordingly, including that little kid. Except it was a long film, if you are okay with a simple and entertaining product, this will do fine. For those who anticipate clever twists and turns, this will fall into an average. There were lots of opportunity to improvise the screenplay, but it was in my mind that I thought it should have been like this and that who is having opinions on the film that was already made. And that's the expectation that will kill your entertainment. I'm getting used to it, so for me it was a decent film and I'll recommend it to the selected viewers.7/10"
" At the end of the tunnel -- One eye looks at you ...
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,8,"My opinion-.""At the end of the tunnel"" is a movie by Rodrigo Grande and a thriller policeman realized with a small budget, but with far greater effects than some great productions, everything is there, a super scenario and a plot that takes you more and more That one advances in this movie. If you like good suspense, look at it, it is worth it."
