" Solid mind blender!
",2021-04-09 00:00:00,8,It gets you all the way to the end. Great acting. Good plot and just enough bait to keep you hooked!
" Mindblowing!
",2021-04-08 00:00:00,10,It's a mindblowing mindblown that will make your mind blown by it's mindblowing mind blown story. üëç
" Pretentious , massively over rated and illogical
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,4,Pro's : the acting is excellent . The storyline is gripping . There are plot twists. It's short .Negatives : it is overly complicated . The movie tries to be too clever . The storyline has more holes than Swiss cheese . It's near impossible to follow the storyline . I just had the feeling of disappointment at the end .
" Very true to Heinlein's story
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,10,"There are a couple of embellishments and a little bit of extra material, but the original story is 9 pages long, so it's to be expected. I watched it not expecting much, as Heinlein's work has been brutalised on screen before, but I was very happy to be surprised by this. If you know the story, you'll love it. If you don't know the story, watch it twice, second time to see all the clues you missed the first time. Fine acting from Hawk and Snook. It's hard to successfully bring a piece of literature to the screen, but this managed very well."
" One Awesome Time Travel Film
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,9,"I had almost given up on Netflix films, and Australian Sci-fi films until I stumbled across this one. Actually, it is based upon a novel by Robert Heinlein called 'All You Zombies', and even though I haven't read that story the thing that stood out was that it seemed to be pretty close to the events in the novel. I say that because the organisations, and the dates that were mentioned, were clearly the style that I would have come to have expected from Heinlein. Mind you, there are a few things in this film that quite surprised me, considering that Heinlein was pretty conservative, but it was still pretty impressive.Mind you, I really don't want to say anything about this film because even the tiniest hint could give too much away. However, what I can say is that it is about time travel, and they really take the concept to the utmost extremes. Okay, normally I would give more away than that, but it really depends on how good the film is, and honestly, this film was really, really good.Another thing that stood out, other than a story that has an awful lot of twists, and some great acting,was also the way the film was put together. It was pretty slick, especially since I suspect that it was rather low budget. Yeah, this film was really, really good, and really well put together, and I certainly recommend watching it, especially if you like sci-fi, time travel, and lots and lots of twists."
" Really worth watching
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,8,I've seen a few scripts written the same way. So for me I sort of grasped the paradox concept mid movie. I always search for these sorts of movies because they do open your mind to all sorts of concepts that have been unexplored by humans. This movie will not let you down if you watch it and you will be glad you did.
" I had never heard of this masterpiece
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,8,"This is likely the best time travel film I've ever seen. The acting is superb, the cinematography is exceptional and the storyline is gripping. I thoroughly loved this movie.The thing that has me scratching my head is that I'd never heard of it before. This movie was released 7 years ago. Clearly the marketing let the cast and crew down."
" Great acting, still don't understand the storyline
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,5,"The movie had a great script, great acting and was well presented.I don't however understand how the paradox of time travel works in this story. If not for him meeting himself, there would be no baby, who is himself and without himself mentoring him there'd be no story.The original meeting of the two paradoxes that go on to have a child is therefore impossible and implausible."
" Extremely bad and confused
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,1,"Bad. Confused. Boring.
One of the worst movies I ever watched."
" Worst movie ever made!!!!
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,1,"By far the worst hours i have ever spent in my life
If you read this review, you should understand that the movie you are gonna watch is the most disgusting one ever thought
Just awfull and way too weird. The only word that came in my mind when i finished it was disgusting.."
" A clever and thoughtful time travel experience
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,9,"Thinking of all my favourite time travel films, and they are as ll a bit obvious - there is a twist in there and it's always about a paradox.This one has twists and you won't see the conclusion coming until nearly the end. Great actor and cleverly put together to make you think it's about one thing and it's about another.Had a nice high quality feel to it and it wasn't made to be flashy. I liked that.Hawke did great and he should be proud of this one.One thing- it is a bit slow to start and I urge you to give it a chance.Also, you need to pay attention, if you watch it whilst playing with your phone, you'll miss the important bits and you'll h thy ink it's rubbish.So, pay attention!"
" Can't make my mind up
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,4,"This is either a terrible story well told or a great story badly done. As it comes from Heinlein, I tend to the latter"
" Love twisted movies ?! Watch this
",2021-03-06 00:00:00,8,"Do u know these movie where the last seen explaining every thing , well the whole move was just that seen !"
" Mind bending thriller
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,8,"This movie is a bomb in disguise, it will not just bend your mind but blow it. If you think that movies these days are getting predictable, go watch this. A story convoluted enough to grasp your immediate attention and engagement, a character worth rooting for, and a premise filled with chase and thrill, makes it a perfect Time bending masterpiece to watch right now. No, it is not as complicated as Primer, but it brings with itself a good movie material in mostly every aspect, so it is worth recommending and maybe Primer will top some other list but for an average person interested in some time-bending thrill, this is the way to go."
" Very unique?
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,4,"Probably the most stupid line ever written.
""We found something very unique. One of a kind actually"".Unique means one of a kind, actually.It's a binary choice, something is on or off, alive or dead, unique or not unique.
To say a thing is ""very unique"" is stupid.Unfortunately, this writer thinks that unique is synonymous with unusual.
""We found something very unusual. One of a kind actually"".
Makes perfect sense as does
""We found something very unusual. Unique actually""."
" A Best movie
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,10,"A very good SF MOVIE ever.
It was indeed a deeply movie."
" Brilliant story, badly executed.
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,7,"The story is great. The twists and turns it takes are incredible, and what you find out in the end is just amazing. Yet, I just didn't find myself going wow!I think the story should have been exploited better. The makers of the movie should have gone all-in. They didn't. And although I am a fan of Ethan Hawke, I really don't think he aced it this time. And as for Sarah Snook, well, I found her very unlikable from the very beginning, which made me very unsympathetic to her her dilemma from the start. Unfortunately, I didn't like the setting, the characters, but what kept me going was just how compelling the story was.Ironically, I will recommend it, if only for the sheer brilliance of the story."
" Flawed (inevitably?)
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,5,"A wonderfully entertaining film -- and the story The Unmarried Mother tells is truly harrowing -- but, after some reflection, I suspect this works much better on the page than on screen.In the original short story by Robert A. Heinlein, on which this film is based, I assume you're left to imagine how the characters of The Unmarried Mother and The Barkeep look and sound. But, once given a physical realisation on screen, it makes it difficult to suspend disbelief. (I can't say more without including spoilers.)So this is a wild, entertaining and disturbing ride as you try to work out the relationship between the various characters. But at the end of the film you may look back and think that, for all that, it really doesn't work."
" Explosive Ending
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,9,"I watched this in two sittings. I think it worked so well that way.An hour in I was a little disappointed that an exciting opening scene had been usurped by a narrated story of a seemingly bit-part character. However, her story was so tragic as to play on my mind for a couple of days.When I came back to the film I quickly guessed a couple of the plot twists - but not all of them. As they slowly unfolded over the last twenty minutes, I have to say my mind was blown. What an awesome finish. The whole film is tied up there and just pulls everything - and I mean every little thing, nothing is extraneous - together so brilliantly.No, you don't get back to the exciting action that the opening scene promised, or that Ethan Hawke movies often bring you - but you don't need that. Trust me.I loved it. It will stay with me, and hopefully you, for weeks and leave you questioning your concept of time more than binge-watching a season of Dr Who."
" Really makes you think
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,10,I think this is under-rated. For me it's one of the best concept sci fi movies out there. It's dense - demands a repeat viewing and actually can only be fully appreciated once you know what is happening already. For those who enjoy Tenet and Interstellar.
" This is not how a movie should be.
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,7,"Excellent possibility ruined.Talented are those who can simply the complexity of story for audience otherwise they are just fluanting their superiority complexes
Bold enough to try for a off track taste but somehow missed to make it satisfyingly entertaining."
" Mind-bendingly good
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,8,"It will difficult to review this movie without discussing the plot and that would just ruin it for everyone yet to see this. Suffice to say, it's a wibbley, wobbly, timey-wimey thing extrodinare and to fully understand it's intricacies I reckon I need to watch it numerous times. However, this doesn't make it hard hard to follow and it certainly doesn't make it a film to be avoided. Its superbly written and superbly acted (it is unbelievable that Sarah Snook has not made it as a big time Hollywood actress based on this excellent performance) and well worth your time if you like thought provoking sci-fi rather than action and special effects."
" Decent movie
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,5,"It was a pretty good movie with a fairly big twist , but the time traveling got very confusing and you feel a need to watch the movie again after you're done even though it's not entertaining enough to watch again."
" Underrated
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,10,"Most underrated movie
One of the best mind bending movies of all time"
" Mind is absolutely Blown!
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,10,This movie will leave you speechless! Wow! One of a kind.
" Jaw-dropping performances
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,10,"Sarah Snook deserved an Oscar for playing both a woman and man after gender transformation, and the time travel story with Ethan Hawke's charm and charisma is absolutely mind-blowing. This is the sci-fi we need more of."
" Either I'm as smart as I think I am, or this film isn't as smart as it thinks it is.
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,5,"Shame really, 7.5/10 sci-fi about time travel I had never seen before. Perfect! I thought.But it was too obvious. Approximately 1/4 of the way through the film I knew all our characters were in fact the same person. So it made the rest if the film really boring. The fact that it kept throwing clues even in the final 5 or 10 minutes that this was the case was almost insulting and annoying. I can also think of many different loopholes within the film's plot which then made the film even more annoying. However, acting was good, cinematography, music, directing and all that good stuff were well done.Can't help but feel that this whole plot/ idea can be done a lot better. I hope one day it is."
" Other Movies Must Bow To This One!!!
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,10,"The first time I watched this movie years ago I was confused and baffled. It made sense but my brain was still trying to put the pieces together! I found it quite enjoyable as it drew me in more.The second time watching it recently, I understood it a bit more and made sense of each character very carefully. It's still very confusing and you won't be able to stop your brain trying to work out what's going on even when the next scene comes on, but in the end it all begins to make a little more sense and you just want to laugh and give yourself some credit for keeping up with such a great puzzle.This movie is DEFINITELY worth the watch. I won't add spoilers because you will still likely just be confused anyway üòÖ"
" time travel gets confusing
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,6,"Ethan Hawke is a time traveling cop. just done with reconstructive surgery from his last mission, he's one job away from retirement, like every other cop film. working as a bartender, he meets up with ""the unmarried writer"" (aussie Sarah Snook). and she starts telling her story, about training as a female astronaut. and some tragic events right after that. with some unique medical issues thrown in. and off we go, traveling into the past. The bartender is getting his own mission of catching a bomber tangled up with that of the unmarried writer. much confusion. gender bending. mind bending. time bending. and more. hard to explain. guess you'll have to see it! good. but pretty confusing. directed by Michael and Peter Spierig, the twins from Germany."
" Amazing
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,10,"This movie is the best movie about time travel
this movies should gave 10"
" I can't comprehend how ""Predestination"" is not so famous
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,8,"This movie is simply great, not the greatest ever, but it is very enjoyable. All the time travel stuff is very good and well-thought and in general the story is entertaining. I think the movie benefits form the fact that it has a small scope and it tries only to tell a fun story and not to revolutionise the time travel genere. And so the writers were able not to break the rules they established giving the viewer a more satisfying sensation. So, if you are looking for a time travel film ""Predestination"" is a very solid choice, it will give you a good time."
" We Are Our Own Paradox
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,10,"What if we are the paradox of ourselves,
continuously bound to repeat the same damn mistakes
that will pave the road cemented to our feet,
and around and around we shall still go,
never realizing we are puppet to our own strings.
And if giving the chance to cut ourselves free,
we tell ourselves that this time will be different,
the vicious cycle broken,
only to walk in the same shoes again."
" MIND. BLOWING.
",2021-01-02 00:00:00,10,Stop reading this review and go watch this movie. WOW!
" Mr. Nolan isn't the only one who can play with time
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,9,"I don't know why I am watching this so late but as they say, better late than never. Spierig brothers nailed it. Recently I watched the German series dark and became familiar with the bootstrap paradox, here the predestination paradox AKA casual loop has been shown in a mind bending way. The twists will keep coming and will keep you spellbound. It's not only about time travel, it's much more. Although if you watch mystery movies often, you could guess the main twist little early , but still it's a treat to watch. Must watch if you like the Sci-fi genre"
" defies logic of physics
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,3,A person born in 1965 is stolen n planted in 1945 and in 1975 is of 60+ years of age. Moreover a person himself is the boy and the girl and even makeout to have a child is illogical and pathetic thi king by the writer. at the end felt angry
" Not for those who demand more than a good story
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,6,"(Better options to watch are at the end of this review.)Predestination offers a moderately compelling story free of detrimental plot holes or logical inconsistencies. Its central concept is also likely to be novel to the first-time viewer.Where the film suffers is in its presentation. Most of the script is narration or explanatory monologue, the latter often delivered over cut scenes of what's being described. While these narrative techniques are not unusual, they are best used sparingly; Predestination is Exhibit A in the case for why.Think of a thriller where a central character explains a discovery or final twist as you see action that was hidden from you up until that point. Or a character study or biopic that opens with the protagonist laying the groundwork for the rest of the story with some critical details upfront. Now imagine that technique used for most of a film. Have you heard of ""show, don't tell?"" Predestination is all tell.I'll concede that there are excellent productions that use these techniques to this degree, but they demand two prerequisites: a standout script and first-class acting. Dialogue must be profound and tight, free of filler. The acting must be so exceptional that you forget they're acting at all. Without either -- or in this case, both -- the presentation quickly grows tired and burdensome. The Man from Earth is a good parallel from the modern sci-fi canon that actually suffers a disastrous fate from its even worse marks in both measures.Ultimately Predestination is an average film, a far cry from the masterpiece or disaster that other reviewers would have you believe.Similar titles I'd recommend you watch instead: Moon, Looper, Edge of Tomorrow, Minority Report, Inception, Interstellar, Never Let Me Go, The One I Love, Sunshine, Donnie Darko, Source Code, Twelve Monkeys, Gattaca"
" Mind bending
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,10,This movie will completely blow your mind off. It has a very complex plot which is very well written and executed.
" Sounds Better On Paper
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,6,"I'm not gonna dwell on the whole trans gender thing since it was crucial component of the story but the whole notion of the antagonist, protagonist and the people in between being the same person sounds better on paper and in action it wasn't as intriguing. On the top of that the way they shot the movie it revealed many things so easily so I figured out most of the movie half way in. The tale of a snake eating it's own tale was indeed unique but then again there are way better time loop movies out there compared to this."
" My brain hurts
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,9,"13 monkeys meets Looper. Don't try to figure this out as you're watching it cause you will be wrong. Climatic through out. Edge of seat watching. It constantly keeps you engaged. Just when you think it's over, it keeps going. Great acting, 4 main characters, or is it?"
" Mind blowing !!
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,10,Movies like this falls in the category of INCEPTION and TENT. This movie requires effort to understand and only those would cherish who takes out time to understand the sequence of the events.Overall really good execution of the movie and enjoyed a lot. Post watching the movie you feel from the very first scene game is on !!
" Snake eating it's own tail? More like pigeon eating it's own vom!
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,1,Sarah Snook is amazing... Other than that. Utter nonsense.
" One of the best plot twists ever in a movie.
",2020-12-05 00:00:00,9,"At first you'll think it is just a cat-mouse run, but hell no, it isn't. It's one hell of a movie. Just watch it for it's mind-bending ending. You won't be disappointed."
" Predestination
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,7,"Predestination was a fine and different kind of Sci Fi time travel movie that had also good twists in it and some great acting both from Hawk and our lead actress that was honestly amazing in all of her scenes.Story was little boring to me in beginning but towards the end it become very fast,enterteining and even chilling in sort of a way.Time travel staff was done in a very cool way and i liked the way how our character from Hawke teleported between times.Ending and special effects were also solid and so was direction.Predestination was a good Sci fi film"
" Excellent movie
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,10,Bestest best movie of time travelling and loop based conditions...u have to watch 2 to 3 times for better understanding..i m giving 5 star to these movie....good job
" Definitely Highly Overrated !
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,2,"I would normally appreciate a movie along these lines.There is just no substance here. It thinks it's smart, fresh, not seen before, new.It's NOT !The movie is slow, dull, and brining.Most of the movie takes place in one set even.Neither the actor using or efforts are anything to write home about. Worse yet the story is SO bad!I'd rather watch a D rated SyFy channel original movie."
" Artsy Fartsy.. but NOT good
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,5,"As someone who loves sci fi and sci fantasy, I thought this would be great.. but man, WHAT a stinker! It shows a 7.5, but it's not something I would EVER watch again.
I watched this with my 19 year old daughter (I'm 57) and we both hated it.
Yes.. positively ""artsy"", but an artsy movie does NOT make a good movie. It's what annoys me about artsy movies that some people think artsy means good and leaves a high review. It, in my opinion, is NOT good and not worth even a 5.0 rating!
Felt like watching paint dry.. and at the beginning of this movie the whole thing became pretty predictable. Nothing about it in the last 30 minutes left us with a ""who'd have thought?""
A high rating for a bad movie always leaves me thinking that cast, crew, family and friends stacked the reviews.
I wouldn't waste the time."
" Wow what a nice find!
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,8,"What a solid, original concept. Not a traditional sci-fi flick. Or even a traditional ""time travel"" flick. The ""sci-fi"" in the film is so subtle for the most part... until the end I guess. Anyone could enjoy it. I'm not actually sure what genre this movie is. Lol. But wow, it's extremely well acted by Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook (!). The writing and directing are top notch. A very nice find 6 years after its original release. I enjoyed every minute of it."
" Confusing
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,5,Some good acting. I find the storyline is very confusing
" Unlike anything else
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,10,Very good movie. Cast and acting top notch. Especially Snoot.
" Too many prematurely given hints, including its title
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,7,"The main twists in the plot were both hinted in the narrative too early, well before the final revelation, making them unsatisfying for those who wanted some unexpected surprises in this kind of film.Spoiler AlertWhat's most unexpected for me was how the first half of the film was all about someone telling his/her past in a bar, when I expected some more time traveling and this agent outsmarting or being outsmarted by the bomber, but all we get is two guys chatting in the bar."
" An elegantly shot depiction of a limited idea
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,5,"There is a kind of elegance to Predestination. It has one, simple idea and it depicts it with clarity. It is possibly the ultimate high-concept movie in that regard, except that putting its idea: 'a time-travelling cop who is also a time-travelling terrorist creates themselves in an endless time loop with echoes of the myths of Tiresias and Sisyphus' would probably not have convinced Jerry Bruckheimer to get behind it.Ethan Hawke is doing a fair job, with that constipated look actors sometimes do to convey prolonged mental anguish. Sarah Snook is definitely given more to do and she does it very well.It's a solid premise with some solid performances and the idea holds the promise of playing with ideas about gender, sanity, mortality, morality and innocence (i.e. lots of binaries creating unities, closing circles, you get the idea).The problem is that once it has set up the 'how to' bit, the mechanics of how the time-loop is created, it runs out of time. None of these ideas are really explored, just hinted at. Noises off.I often am moved to write a review of either movies which fail to fulfil their promise - The Haunting of Bly Manor - or ones which by successfully exploring their ideas provoke something approaching enlightenment - Arrival or Blade Runner 2049 come to mind. Predestination is unusual in that it successfully explains its apparently intriguing core idea, only for the end result to be less than the sum of its parts.All in all, an oddity that I'll probably remember but not with any great emotional or intellectual fondness."
" Found hyped
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,6,The movie is good but it is overrated and hyped too much. There are pretty good movies based on time travels. The movie is focusing on the past of one charecter around 1 hour (it should be quicker) and the remaining 35 mins about the actual story. If they had extended the movie with more scenario from current scene ( blasting time) it could have been a masterpiece.
" Clever and very original.
",2020-10-27 00:00:00,8,"The plot convince me that time travel is possible, but still have some issues. :)Very enjoyable, with twists just a little bit predictable. Even so, surprising and interesting."
" Confusing but fun
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,9,"Since Total Recall this film is my new best for confusing themes and story. Acting is convincing (enough) to support the story. It will keep you busy thinking about it for hours, if not days."
" Criminally Underrrated
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,9,"In terms of sci-fi plot complexity, this film does sit into the same chair of some of Christopher Nolan's time bending movies but the reason I believe Predestination is not given deserving credits is because it does not fit the typical blockbuster cinematic experience such as the likes of Inception in terms of cinematography, engrossing score or the big budget lavish showcase. Predestination is well written, perfectly placed and includes great performances from the actors. It glues your attention the screen the entire time and the twist and turns of the movie certainly ranks it as one of the best sci fi movies ever made, at least in my opinion."
" Warning - spoiler!
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,8,"A young woman of uncertain and unhappy upbringing is seduced and falls pregnant by a stranger who then deserts her: the baby is abducted. The traumatic birth reveals that she has both male and female reproductive organs, and she undergoes involuntary transgender surgery as a result. Now a young man, he/she is recruited by a member of the time travel police to try to prevent a terrorist outrage. Or so he thinks...This is adapted from Robert Heinlein's story ""-All You Zombies-"" which, itself, developed a template tried out in By His Bootstraps. Both play savagely with time travel paradoxes, and this take on things takes the Bootstraps template several steps further. The film adaptation adds in the terrorist element, but not unreasonably so.This is quite good fun for the way in which it subverts expectation, and Sarah Snook is excellent as both the pre- and post-operative protagonist."
" Shear Wastage of time
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,2,"This movie has no logic, no story. i dont know why its rating is high."
" The movie that can blow your mind twice to thrice ! Masterpiece! üî•üî•üî•
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,10,"The movie starting is very slow then turn to be ""Puzzle of time travel"". Presentation will leave you puzzled until end. It's ending is just OMG and enough to scratch your head like never before. üî•üî•"
" Honestly terrible!
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,3,"How this film gets 7.5 is a mystery to me.
Watched this (accidentally) for the second time, we bailed out the first time.
Convoluted is fine but this is just slow, tedious and without any obvious conclusion. Acting is good but the story is absolutely non sensical and boring. Much better films of this genre to watch."
" Nearly Incomprehensible, But Invigorating And With Two Really Good Performances
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,7,"Without a doubt the films most valuable asset is its nearly incomprehensible plot. Its time travel but on steroids. By the end I still hadn't grasped everything I had just watched. Hell I still don't. Never the less, what makes it so confusing is also what makes it so invigorating. That, and a couple of really good performances by its two leads. Most people should enjoy the convulted ride the film will take them on, and probably overlook its flaws and plot devices. I did."
" Predictable Predestination but Snook shines
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,6,"The movie makers (intentionally) dropped hints left, right and center.If you missed them, it's a really great experience. But if you caught them, the entire story is just waiting to unfold what you already know...(about half way into the movie).It can't be compared to movies like Looper which make no pretense of being an intelligent thriller. They are simple action movies which use time travel as a plot device.However I had to dock points for Predestination for all the promise and falling short (primarily by being too predictable)."
" talky and tedious adaptation of Heinlein's classic short story
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,4,"All You Zombies is a short story by Robert Heinlein that cleverly outlines a paradox inherent in the concept of time travel.Predestination takes the story, adds a terrorism story and one more iteration to the whole thing, and then proceeds to unspool a movie in which a huge chunk is one character telling his life story to another character.The filmmakers spend 100 minutes telling a 20-minute story, and telling it as dully as possible. And the little bit they added in an attempt to make it something more than the intellectual exercise of the original makes it less smart and less ingenious than the story.On the plus side, the Dickensianly-named Sarah Snook is excellent as the teller of the life story. It's a touching, nuanced performance that can't overcome the bland dialogue and sluggish pace she is stuck with.Don't bother watching this movie (I'm so perplexed that it's doing so well on IMDB reviews, but go figure). Do bother reading the short story."
" Bad movie
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,1,"I really don't understand why people like this film. Although well crafted, the twist is just awful. The acting is great and the first act sets up and amazing story and then... just ruins it with the worst idea for a twist ending in the history of film. The message of this film is terrible, and incredibly messed up. Don't watch this garbage."
" A sci-fi noir
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,9,"Very good. Was wrong on the outcome. A stretch to believe the time travel plot, but, still good."
" This is a very tacky...
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,6,"I figured that if someone wrote this story 50 years ago, readers would have said, ""This idea is a bit old-fashioned.
Is Australian cinema half a century behind the curve?
I thought the reminiscences in the first half of the film were interesting because the reminiscences in the first half of the film created a unique atmosphere. Usually, screenwriters are careful not to include reminiscence in reminiscences. So when I saw it in this film, I thought, ""Oh? "" And Later I was like, ""Oh, so that's what happened,"" Then, for me, well, story wasn't that surprising .
Even so, the reason this film is not a bad film is because of the sharpness of the script. The fact that no extra characters are included in the story is good. Also, there is no inflated episode at all. Everything is neatly fitted in like a well-done short story, and it's easy to watch with a sense of speed. Also, the fact that there are no extra characters and the story is organized with only the necessary ones creates a very strange feeling."
" It all comes back to you.
",2020-09-01 00:00:00,10,"Perhaps one of the most brilliant, touching and unforgettable stories I've ever come to see or hear of; a terrifically told film!"
" deserves more
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,10,"Mind blowing movie with a fabulous amazing actors and director.
I give it 10/10 because it's the best movie of its category in my opinion."
" Mind bending and twisty till the end. Brilliant.

üë®‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Review :
Predestination is sci fiction marvel which encapsulates time travel, journey of love, fates in ones lives with brilliance. The theme of the movie is a paradox of events like which came first the egg or the chicken. Directors Michael and Peter Spierig make you stick to your seats till the end ,while simultaneously getting thick inside the plot and leave you stunned and mind blown in the end.Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook are outstanding. Brilliant screenplay and direction makes it a treat to the eyes.The experience of watching a great movie should not begin and end within the cinema house itself. It should spark debates, excited discussions, urge countless recommendations and leave you thinking about it for a long time afterwards. This film accomplishes all of these things and in abundance.

" Satisfies all your time travelling cravings
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,8,"After having watched Dark (series on Netflix), i was dying for something to fulfil the big time-travelling black-hole sized hole in my heart. Predestination did not disappoint. Classic case of chicken or th egg, time paradox anomalies, it is not as boundary-pushing as Dark, but just enough to titillate your time travel bug. Go watch it. Don't despair over the boring part in the middle; its important and leads to something wonderful."
" I was predestined to love this film.
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,10,"As expected, Predestination is an intelligent masterpiece. It's an original, creative, imaginative, fun time-travel epic that must be seen at least once in life. Not just the concept, even the performances will leave your breathless, especially from Sarah Snook: I was really shocked and I don't want to say why, or how. I'll leave that for you to experience yourself. And Ethan Hawke is of course brilliant: he delivers the dialogue effectively and shows his acting chops with finesse.The film has a perfect blend of well-choreographed action, touching drama and surprising twists as it unfolds. The best thing about the film is it's not too convoluted or hard to follow. The makers have done a really great job at handling this and have tried to keep it as simple as possible to understand. It's the ending, however, that left me by surprise. I'd myself predicted a number of possible twists but to be honest, none of them came true. It's that unpredictable!At the end of the day, Predestination is an exciting and engaging sci-fi action thriller that will pull you into the premise and its atmosphere, and you won't even realize when 90 minutes will fly by. This is indeed a thoughtful movie and by the time it will end, you'd have realized that you were predestined to be thrilled. Don't expect the film to leave you with all answers, though. It will interact with you, it will want you to piece together every bit of the story, and that's where it truly wins."
" One gigantic plot hole must be overlooked
",2020-08-04 00:00:00,7,"This can be a fun movie if one is willing to overlook the fact that the baby could never have existed if her parents never met. Her parents of course can never meet since the baby cannot exist without them and the parents are the baby.Once we get over that ridiculous absurdity, the movie is entertaining. Apparently a man is sent back into the past to change his own life and complications ensue. We see her early life, her adult life, her change into a man, his time jumps to try and find the bomber and finally, his old age where he happens to be the bomber he has been trying to find throughout the movie. Crazy huh?"
" Absolute *****
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,1,"This film contains the worst, and I hope only, space prostitute training academy montage ever committed to celluloid. It's not only a pile of sexist garbage but also incredibly boring."
" Time travel paradox taken to their most absurdist extremes...
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,8,"... and it works. They managed to pull off the impossible: leverage an age old 'what if' trope from time travel narratives, and turned into something not just watchable, but genuinely entertaining.I feel had it been a bit more raw it could have been perfect, but this gets the softly-softly hollywood treatment and perfect production values, at its expense of course.Overall, a great scifi entry."
" My take on this exceptionally breathtaking masterpiece
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,10,"So the first time I watched this movie, I didn't take much into account. So I decided to watch it again and this time paid very close attention. Now I've read some of the comments here and I think many are still missing the story so let me explain what I think is going on here.The movie starts off with Sarah Snook (Unmarried Mother), who is on a mission to find the fizzle bomber, at the same time, the Ethan Hawks (The Barkeep - Unmarried Mother's Body, Ethan's Face), has also traveled back to the same spot to try and stop the fizzle bomber. He gets into a fight with fizzle bomber, gets whooped and fizzle bomber gets into a shooting spree with Unmarried Mother which leads to Unmarried Mother burning his face. The Barkeep comes in and helps him escape. Later on in the movie, you will realize that after this incident, the Barkeep regretted his actions which led to the face burn and had he not jumped to that scene, Unmarried Mother wouldn't have burnt his face and needed a face transplant. So the Barkeep sets out to correct this which is the entire point of the movie IMO. BUT to correct this, he has to correct all the wrongs done from all his previous jumps hence why he had to go back and steal little Jane, meet up with Unmarried Mother and try and correct the hurt caused when he left Old Jane without an explanation. So in so doing, Unmarried Mother realizes he impregnated old Jane so this time he won't sleep with her therefore Old Jane won't give birth and won't find out that she has that condition. And because Unmarried Mother couldn't get into the corporation with her condition, the Barkeep helped her get recruited by jumping her to the future. Then the Barkeep will go back in time, kill the fizzle guy which happened to be the person whose face he is wearing (I think that was just a plot twist that had nothing to do with the main story), Barkeep then takes his identity and lives happily with Alice, which meant that Unmarried Mother, now an agent, will not be sent on that mission to stop Fizzle Bomber where she burnt her face. At the end of the day, the Barkeep completes his final mission and sets things back in order.I hope I made sense ü§£"
" Must Watch
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,10,This is absolutely one of the best sci fi thriller movie. I don't have any word to explain this movie. Amazing direction and acting. Loved the climax. Watch it asap. Worth to watch.
" Brilliant use of a time travel paradox!
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,10,A must watch for anyone who likes science fiction and time travel. These are the kinda movies that I like to see. A person having no ties to time and having no ancestry and is his own mother and father and his own ancestor is so amazing.
" Criminally underrated
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,10,"Predestination is a work of a genius and i feel that this is the kind of film you don't see too often. It is truly a cinematographic masterpiece. The recent German show Dark has taken many concepts from this movie but i think Predestination stands out.
Sarah Snook""The Unmarried Mother"" is astonishing and the Spierig Brothers deserve all the praise for this brilliant. thought-provoking mind bending brilliance. Overall Predestination is one of my favorite movie of all time"
" Boom! Another hidden gem. A MUST WATCH Thriller.
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,9,"When I first watched 'Triangle' i thought i will never be able to find another mind bending movie like it, for i am a true triller lover, but Predestination DEFINITELY proved that having higher expectations in movies to come is a valid and hopeful measure we all can take for as movies are very important and influential. Watch this thriller right ahead."
" A Strange Paradox
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,6,"Checked this movie out because the premise looked interesting for an Ethan Hawke movie. This is a crazy time travel movie about a continuous paradox of a man/woman time traveler falling in love with different versions of him/herself throughout his/herself, going back in time to procreate a baby version of themselves with their male and female self, then kidnapping the baby version of themselves and then traveling back twenty years in the past to drop the baby off at an ophranage so they can grow up to as the female version of themselves to mate with the male version of themselves to create a baby version of themselves which the future version of themselves will kidnap and then go back in time to drop the baby version of themselves at the orphanage to start the cycle again. The final predestination is the protagonist meeting with the future antagnoist version of himself. Instead of accepting the dark part of himself, he kills the dark part of himself and begins the neverending cycle once again.Interesting concept which is way easier to follow along than Cloud Atlas. This movie explores The Great Paradox. As humans, do we have free will or are our lives, paths, choices predestined?"
" Mind blowing
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,8,"Literally! Mind blowing. It's a great film that unravels gradually to explain your confusion throughout. You just need to keep watching, listen to what everyone is saying and wait..... you won't be disappointed."
" Time travel at it's best.
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,7,"I loved this film. The time travel is complex, yet easy to understand. I don't like the ending, but I doubt it could have been any different. This film is a much must watch for time travel fans."
" Revelations
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,9,"The movie takes a unique approach to the sci-fi genre and astounded me with the character depth (viewing them as individual characters) that the story provides while also keeping the time travel aspect of the movie very much alive.The movie does not contain much of the stunning visuals, bright light/gravity defying time travel scenes which are in most sci-fi/time travel films and focuses more on the actual story (which is beautiful).The story line is unraveled beautifully by the screenplay providing us with character depth rather than scientific jargon while also keeping the viewers guessing at the edge of their seats if there is actually a mystery and how the foreshadowed scene relates to what is going on in the movie.It is a hugely underrated film which is original, engaging and every minute is worth watching. This had me close my eyes at the end of the movie and took me a minute to actually process what I have just witnessed BECAUSE IT WAS SO GOOD."
" Best Time traveling movie
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,10,"Apart from Netflix series DARK, this is another best time-traveling movie."
" Flawless movie!! However 3d version has no 3d
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,10,"Masterpiece of a movie, absolute must see!! I purchased the 3d bluray which was a waste of money just buy regular bluray it's not only less expensive by at least half, the 3d is non existant!! Loved the movie so much but next time which will be soon wont bother with 3d option."
" Very good, very dark and, perhaps, a bit confusing.
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,8,"""Predestination"" is a very good sci-fi film. I enjoyed it very much, but I should warn you...it's very strange and a bit confusing. This doesn't mean it's bad...it has lots of neat twists and turns and is worth your time.
The film is about a temporal agent (Ethan Hawke) who is blown up, but not killed, at the beginning of the film. After extensive surgeries and rehabilitation, he is sent on another case....in order to recruit a new temporal agent. When he meets this future agent, John tells his life story...which is very sad and weird. But if you think this is weird...just keep watching!The acting, writing and direction are all very good. I also enjoyed Sarah Snook and her dual roles. There really isn't any other film like it...and I will wrap it up quickly, as I don't want to ruin it for you by revealing too much of the plot."
" - What comes first the chicken or the egg? - 75
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,7,"A film which offers something very unique in an overcrowded genre and holds both patience, seriousness and class. It offers twistes that most people have probably never seen before. And once the smoke has settled, the Spierig brothers have managed to create a time travel film that holds its internal logic as good as any in the genre. In addition, it offers great solutions and stays relatively controlled throughout its whole, and therefore, with the extraordinary acting by Hawke and by Snook (although Snook is a little too similar to Emma Stone for her own good), Predestination succeeds very well with such an complexity."
" A man walked into a bar - think you've heard it before? ... Think again!
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,9,"This is a film deserving of your attention. You'll be rewarded with a great trip through twists, turns, double backs and leaps forward as you slowly come to grin at the understanding that's gradually forming in your mind.As I said, a man walked into a bar and the result is a movie that grabs your attention and gives you more than your moneys worth. A cracking plot from a Heinlein short story about time. Not a wasted scene and some great acting.A great way to spend a couple of hours.Oh, yes. A man walked into a bar. Ouch!!"
" One of the masterpiece about time travel
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,8,"The name is Predestination. So from the name we can guess that the destination is kind of always fixed. You can't change your past,future,present no matter how many times you travel through time.Everything is predestine. Here they wanted to do something to stop the frizzle bomber but that keeps happening just as always and nothing is changing at all. Here my theory is when the future has occured you cannot change the past. No matter how many times you travel to the past or trying to change the past It's always been a part of the incident."
" So good!!!!!
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,10,"I'm glad this film is getting all the love it is getting. This is good story-telling. I don't want to give any spoilers, just watch it. If you don't like it, then we don't haver much in common."
" I just must review it! 10plus/10
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,10,"Long time ago I wanted to watch it, now at Covid-19 times I have more time and finally watched an old movie. The idea is brilliant. I wonder how exactly the idea was born and the script was written. In what circumstances? Obviously the fantastic doesn't happen in real life, it can't be based on your experience, so a writer must have rich imagination for such a creation). I'll check other writer's work. The only thing I didn't get it, how could not John remember the face of a guy which he spend the best night in her/his entire life? 10/10 anyway."
" I watched it in 2020 and still got a kick out of it
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,10,So after 6 years ... In the realm of mindboggling time travel shows like Dark and whatnot ... This was a very short and sweet one and a half hour ride... I mean you got serious twists and turns in 90 mins that didnt demand a slow burn of 20+ hrs to build characters and story.If you like movies that have an intense storytelling in the first half ( snook ! ) and an unraveling puzzle in the second then this is for you.The ending is satisfying and will leave you thinking .. which came first .. the chicken or the egg ?
" It's a good attempt in the Sci-Fi genre. But...
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,8,"I won't reveal the entire plot but the story revolves around a girl named Jane who was left at the door of an orphanage in 1943 by an unknown man. Her story progresses and takes up most of the part of the movie. I will leave the further parts for you to watch and decide for yourself. There is also a bomber named ""Fizzler Bomber"" who is planning to take innocent lives in 1970s and an agency based in present is trying to stop him in order to change the course of events thereby changing future.Although I liked the concept of time-travel and paradox shown here but it wasn't executed properly or I would say logically with some explanation in the movie. I would've enjoyed some more elements in writing just to make it a more of a complete story. The time travel just takes place through a USFF Coordinations Transformer Field Kit which is just the fancy name of The Time Machine. It can take a person to around 50 years (in past and future) from the zero point (the year of its invention i.e., 1981). The movie relates Jane's story to the time machine in a way some might find shocking and confusing.However, I was able to predict the entire plot given that I've watched content based on the similar concept already. There were some very clear indications leading to it. But, is it possible to change the future? Try to find for yourself.Overall, it was not a disappointing experience."
" Much better then my expectations
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,10,"Predestination is a science fiction thriller movie directed by The Spierig Brothers and stars Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook and Noah Taylor.This is probably one of the most perfect movie I have seen in recent times, and yes was very impressed with the climax.We all must have seen different types of time travel movies but this is something unique and with an unimaginative ending.Credit should be given to all the three lead characters but the highlight was Sarah Snook with her no-nonsense acting.Plot of the movie is complicated but Interesting. The first half is based on the story of Sarah Snook and the second half is full of surprises. There are some scenes that gets predictable but climax is very shocking. Screenplay of the movie good and gripping and the best part of the movie is that the director didn't tried to stretch the movie unnecessary.I would recommended to watch this movie and I am sure you will definitely love this."
" it has one big mistake
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,7,"Spoil alert
In this movie you can a huge mistake and that is difrencess between the unmaried girl and the bartender faces. and i cant say it was a slight difrence!First of all, a person whose face is so burnt that it is not possible for him to have such a beard later and the second and the important one is about difrencess between their jaws froms and their faces shapes. We can clearly see that the girls jaw and face shape is more like a little circle but the bartender face shape and his jaws form is long and like real 40 yo men! Aside from that big mistake, I can say that we watched a great and amazing movie with a very exciting and mysterious story."
" High Level ScienceFiction Movie üòÆ
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,9,"It's a paradox, within a paradox, within an alternate universe. Confused yet? That's exactly what this movie is. However, I can't deny that it was still amazing. It's basically Jane, little Jane, fizzle bomber, etc. But they're all the same person!! Talk about mind-blowing!! You really need to pay attention in this one. It was deep, emotional, and definitely weird at times. But it is also a very intelligent and well scripted movie. I have never seen anything like it. I would definitely recommend watching at 1least once. Or may be twice in case you need to wrap your head around all of the twists and turns and craziness."
" Masterpiece
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,10,"If anybody demanded a movie to spend quality time, I'd recommend this movie without any doubt"
" Watched it twice.
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,10,Sarah Snook at her best. I really enjoy the way she delivers her dialogues. Unique concept of time travel and this whole story will be a fun in the end for you. You can't afford to miss one if you're a thrill lover. Mind will be twisted in the end.
" Overrated
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,5,"This is by far the weirdest film I have ever seen. The storyline is original, the acting is there and the dialogue is fine. However the ending leaves you with alot of questions and can keep you up at night wondering what the hell you just watched. I'm trying to figure out what this film really means. Maybe self love? Maybe finding your trueself? Whatever the meaning or if there even is one I don't understand the high rating. However if you like movies that end being open for interpretation this is something you will enjoy."
" This movie might melt your brain a little.
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,8,"Other than being difficult to follow here and there, (it's about time travel so it happens) this is truly a great movie. It's entertaining and engaging. It's well written and produced. The cast does a stellar job making the characters live and emotional. Watch this!"
" One of the best Science Fiction movie based on Time Travel.
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,9,"A must watch for anyone who enjoys a mind bending, soul imploding film. Although the first scene is action packed, not much is understood as to the who's and why's. After that, and for only a few minutes, the movie seemed slow and without direction. Soon after it becomes intriguing, suspenseful, and where the direction of the film is going (although not yet understood). The Director was able to clearly explain the unexplainable at the very end of the movie. So, for those that sometimes walk out of a movie not understanding what happened, I can assure you that will not be the case here. I give many kudos to the original writing, screen writing, directing, and acting. This movie will be ranked as one of my all time best films ever."
" Good but ...
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,7,A good movie but i didn't get the moral behind it ..... Ok he went to the past and future . Ok what's then?
" Mind boggling
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,9,"3 things make this movie great:it's really well done; acting, writing, plot, are all first class. The story hooks you pretty quickly and reels you right in.it's based on a story by Robert Heinlein, one of the best, if not the best SF writer of all times, if you are familiar with his work, you know what I'm saying-it is thought provoking and most likely you'll watch it a second timeNot sure how I missed this, but really glad I found it!"
" Fabulous time travel movie ever
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,10,Very well directed movie with excellent time loop concept. IT has a good start and after the half it is mind blowing. It has good theory about the time loop theory. It deserves more rating and recognition for the excellent work done by directors and lead actors.We should encourage such type of movies to better enjoy the suspense and adrenaline boost.
" MAKAUT MAR ACTIVITY
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,10,"Predestination is a 2014 Australian science fiction thriller film written and directed by Michael and Peter Spierig. The film stars Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook and Noah Taylor.I feel like sometimes great movies don't get enough recognition, films like Prisoners, Enemy, or Predestination.
This film impacted me heavily, and it kept me thinking and thinking about it for a week after I saw it. Ethan Hawke gave a great performance, which keeps me wondering why he ever agreed to do ""The Purge"", but the real standout is Sarah Snook, who is breathtaking in her role.One of the best things about this film was that when I thought it was going in one direction, it took a hard right hand turn. Not many movies make me doubt myself like that. The direction was clean and solid, the cinematography was immaculate, and the special and visual effects were outstanding. Everything about the look of the film was perfect.My only complaints are that the movie's first act was a little slow. However, as the film progresses into the second and third act, the long first act is absolutely necessary. If it was a little shorter, it would've worked so well.
Confusing? Yes. Enjoyable? Big time.If you can see Predestination, definitely do so."
" Chaos
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,1,"Predestination is disorienting, but in a way that suggests narrative chaos rather than narrative control. It tends to drag in setting up what may be one of the most unsatisfying and aggravating plot twists in recent memory."
" WOW
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,8,For a start u have to be in the mood and pay attention to this film if you are/do you are in for a real treat if you pay attention it's not hard to follow but the revelations are immense.
" SOOO MINDBLOWING
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,8,"""The snake that eats its own tail.""The movie was crazy. So much crazy. I expected about what was actually happaned but not that far. I think I'll never watch this movie again cuz even now I feel like my head is about to explode."
" SciFi for the mind
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,6,"The story tells a paradox of time travel. A person who has created and born himself and ultimately kills his future self. This is interesting, but unfortunately a contradiction. I enjoyed the film and the thinking, that's why I give it 6/10."
" Flawed but daring
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,8,"Under-the-radar, concept-driven science fiction with a heavy dose of suspense. Ethan Hawke plays a decade-leaping ""temporal agent,"" dedicated to stopping the spree of a mysterious mass bomber who wipes out several blocks of New York City in the late 20th century. Along the way, he randomly stops by a bar in 1978 where he settles in to share stories with a down-on-his-luck patron and the plot seems to derail. It's strange, confusing pacing that sets aside the core concept in lieu of a very long, seemingly-unrelated aside, but naturally there's more here than meets the eye. That digression is an intriguing one, albeit in a completely different vein than the advertised premise, and tucks neatly into the endgame during the film's chaotic, full-throttle closing act. Fans of Total Recall and Inception will find themselves mesmerized by the percussive power of its late plot twists, even if they are made a hair less ambiguous than I think was really necessary. These are some pretty big swings, and they'll probably turn off a good portion of the audience, but I enjoy that kind of risk-taking and it feels like they transform what had been a mediocre also-ran into something much closer to the remarkable. Flawed but daring, those last ten minutes are a helluva rush."
" Never miss a second!
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,9,"From the very first seconds, you find yourself in the middle of a strange and complicated story, and a thousand-piece puzzle that is chaotic, you don't understand anything about this puzzle for exactly ten seconds at the end of your film. The storyline is almost like Inception. Acting and special graphic effects weakened the film, which of course could be due to the low budget of the film."
" Some things are just inevitable

Today there is a man, androgynous, out of the three realms of cause and effect, still belong to the five elements of reincarnation. Life is just a puppet game, how desperate."
" Masterpiece
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,10,Well I downloaded it long time ago but just couldn't watch it. finally today I watched and it's just mind blowin fully based on predestination paradox. a masterpiece indeed
" Wow..woww..wowww..

" Sarah Snook is brilliant; very enjoyable film
",2020-03-21 00:00:00,9,"I watched this stoned like I tend to watch most films (for me, it adds to the enjoyment) and it was really something to behold while in that state of mind. My personal recommendation would be to watch this a little high haha, because I think marijuana goes hand-in-hand with sci-fi movies.Sarah Snook was beyond excellent, I've been waiting for her to blow up since this role and I'm shocked that it hasn't happened yet. Ethan Hawke proved once again that he's very talented. Overall this was a very special film that I've recommended to friends and that I'd be very keen to watch again! :)"
" Great Film! Nearly Perfect!
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,8,"This movie is a load of fun! It is a thrill ride that I found incredibly enjoyable. The score is great, the story is well done and the script is great too. The only flaw with the movie is the end. It's not that it's bad, it's just very easy to see coming. By the time the director reveals to you the twist, you have already figured it out. Other than that it is really good! It definitely isn't for everyone but I think that it is a film that any sci-fi fan should see at least once in their life!"
" Enjoyable with very few flaws

",2020-02-08 00:00:00,1,"... first... time travel never exists but i still wanted to finish it off. Then i Regretted it. I could not comprehend the plot.
When the movie was over i was...dumbfounded. No no. I felt dumb.
Coz i wasnt sure what i have just watched?
Sci fi?
Fantasy?
The plot was okay when Jane was telling her side of the story, it got me really interested, then. When it came to the time machine part, they lost me there.
Damn.
Should have watched something else instead"

",2020-02-03 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie from start to finish, And even with the shock factor that was great to me and logically made me talk alone and smile, A great movie from all sides, what I admire about it is the length of the dialogues and the scene of the storytelling that was very long"
" Very sneaky
",2020-02-03 00:00:00,9,"This was very sneaky and I absolutely love it! Anyone can make an average move with no plot, direction, mystery, etc. Making movies in a rushed effort just for money.. it is very rare and difficult, especially these days, to make something like this. Completely thought out and carefully made!Anyone who is making or writing movies should definitely watch this 1st. A huge amount of thought and patience was required for this. They pulled it off and us viewers are blessed and everyone benefits from a sneaky good, well thought out and not rushed film!Highly recommend setting this! Especially of you're a big Sci-fi fan.. especially as every Sci-fi fan knows, how difficult finding good true Sci-fi is these days! WAY ABOVE AVERAGE!"
" Twist after Twist

" Get ready for Brain yoga
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,8,"Few movies succeed to mess witn your mind, and very few are enjoyed by us while they do so. Predestination (2014), is one of them.A sci fi thriller, directed by the Spierig brothers, is although based on time travel, comes with a twist, Predestination Paradox. Acc to it we can't change our past no matter how hard we try. We can either end up getting witness it or be a part of it. The story is interesting though. Especially, the twist at the end will blow your mind. Ethan hawke has done a great job, but Sarah Snook is the one who steals the show. Her acting as a homosexual woman and her transition into a man is just brilliant. The cinematography and screenplay are excellent too.Now, talking of the flaws, the length of the film is short. Some other interesting elements could be added. The barkeep's hunt for himself could be extended by creating suspense. Also, few more characters could be added for humor."
" Even though these are so predictable it was still decent
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,5,This type of 'thriller' are sooo predictable these days and I picked this entire movie in the first 3 minutes it still makes you think and the basic moral of this story is no matter how you think you me life will turn out you always have a chance to make different choices

" Mind Bending
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,8,"It's the weirdest, the most mind-bending and the most wonderful sci-fi movie ever.
It's brilliant and original, Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook have done a wonderful job.
Where have you ever seen a movie that leads to you as a man having sex with you as a woman in the past giving birth to baby you, coming back from the future with a different face to break up the relationship you are having with yourself, taking baby you to the past to be raised as you then travel to the future to kill old you because it turned out that you are the serial bomber that you were chasing since the beginning? Ha? Ha?
Basically, to make things easier to understand, it's about a man giving birth to himself by impregnating himself then killing himself homicidally and not suicidally."
" Underrated? Absolutely
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,7,This movie was so good but I hated the beginning cuz there was too many unnecessary part
" Predestination foreordained its paradoxical nature and exploited it with individuality.
",2019-10-21 00:00:00,7,"""Which came first: the chicken or the egg?"". An evolutionary question, now the setup for many punchlines, that has transcended time itself. The causality dilemma that considers both cause and effect. Infinite regression. Unsolvable. What really shapes a person's biological anatomy or their metaphorical soul? Evolutionary diversity at birth or the nurturing of our surrounding environment? The aforementioned philosophical paradox is one which The Spierig Brothers held closely to the central plot that, on the surface may befuddle even the most avid sci-fi viewers, but dig somewhat deeper and find that the temporal trajectory is bursting with thematic representation. A time traveller is sent back to 1970s New York to prevent a terrorist, known only as the ""Fizzle Bomber"", from murdering thousands.To mention certain plot strands, even touching upon their delicate coating, would be to spoil this ingeniously creative film. Therefore, as a precaution, I will not discuss the second half. Including the paradoxical plot twists of conception and death. This is a mind-bending sci-fi tale that purely excels when focussing on the human elements of its characters. Forget about the jarring tonal shift from exquisitely detailed flashback narration to sudden sci-fi extravaganza. Put aside the occasional heavy hand-holding (although justified for the dense concept) that unimaginatively explains the limitations of temporal shifting. Exclude the multitude of entrancing twists that seemingly allow the narrative to crumble towards its inevitable conclusion.Predestination works best when it's exploring the human condition. The drive that constitutes our soul. And a central focal point, but not the sole purpose, of the story is Jane's gender reassignment into becoming John. A ""woman"" valued as intersex. Internalised male organs as well as female. Despite raising transgender issues and justifiably exploring the emotional conflict of such a scenario, it's never treated as unfamiliar territory. Much like the film in its entirety, it garners an identity. Enhancing accessibility by turning an irrelevant piece of fiction into a relevant transcendental concept. Snook gave an arousing performance of someone undergoing such a procedure. Harnessing female and male acting qualities and nudging them subtly through her performance.Returning to the preliminary question though, the eternally talented Hawke offers this dilemma to the prognosticating Snook, who simply replies ""The Rooster"". And yet whilst it was a humorous retort, it maps out the ingenious narrative cohesion that The Spierig Brothers moulded. That intimidating evolutionary deliverance, providing a cathartic allure of inevitability. They masqueraded causality through a simple life story told vividly within the confinements of a cigarette infused bar. Strangely, much like with other labyrinthine features, the second viewing allowed me to sniff out breadcrumbs more clearly. The hidden clues that the Brothers had deliberately positioned to reach the predetermined final destination. Extraordinarily clever.The minuscule runtime should've been extended to better build the narrative foundations from the weight of all the mind-blowing twists, but The Spierig Brothers defied genre expectations by pushing a time-orientated story to its limits. The conventional boundaries of storytelling now extended indefinitely, addressing common time travel related issues and exploiting them ingeniously. Intelligence prevails once again."
" Meh
",2019-10-18 00:00:00,4,"Figured out the gist of the entire storyline by 15 minutes into the movie. The end sequence BIG REVEAL! had absolutely no impact, quite the opposite.Good premise and some good mechanisms (the case), but otherwise unsatisfying plot with no resolution."
" Amazing!!
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,9,"I had never heard of this before I watched it. It was a complete mind the 1st time round.I took a couple of watches to totally understand what was going on.The 1st watch was like "" What the hell happened there?""After seeing it again I got it.....I think!The acting is brilliant form both Hawke and Snook.Well worth a watch......Or two or three!"
" I am not sure if I watched a total BS or a masterpiece
",2019-10-10 00:00:00,5,"I give it 5 stars. Not 5 stars as an average film but 5 stars as the mean of 0 and 10.
I do not understand the purpose of this film. I do not understand its meaning but it is a very interesting film to watch and either get excited about it or get really disappointed.
The plot holes are ENORMOUS. I could not understand any of this happening.
It is like a loophole without any meaning. But it is kind of unique I would say."
" More than sci-fi
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,8,"A big fan of sci-fi since forever, a good 60-70% of what I watch is sci-fi. But lately, I come across a subgenre of sci-fi ""under the skin"", ""second Earth"", ""I origins"" fall under.
In the tradition of the twilight zone series, Predestination revisit time travel to tackle great human topics such as exclusion, love, being different, reinvent yourself, fate, self-confidence...
Of course, if you came to see 12 monkeys, or Terminator, you might feel betrayed. But if you love Ethan Hawk and give a chance to a slow-paced, well crafted & filmed movie, you will have a amazing experience.
Of course this movie has flaws, as all movies, and that's in part why I gave an 8 stars rating. But this movie successes at what it aims: follow people, document their dream, aspirations, their struggle with life, and the system pushing on them at all time. Great movie."
" Astonishing
",2019-10-04 00:00:00,10,"Truely a movie you must see and take the time to absorb.At times it plays like a drama but do not be dissuaded, invest in the film and you will be rewarded with a head f*#k of the highest order.
Even on the second and third watch you will be engrossed in the absolute bizzare feeling that this madness is somehow plausible.Just an awesome piece of cinema. Keep In mind the fact it was written as a short story 'All You Zombies' last century no less. Originally penned by science fiction writer Robert S. Heinlein then developed for the big screen by the Spierig brothers and filmed in Australia in 2013"
" Very intelligent movie
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,10,"This movie requires a higher level of intellectual abilities, unbelievable !"
" Charismatic Ethan Hawke.
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,8,"If you liked the netflix's original s√©rie ""Dark"" than you must ses this movie, more simple for me but great acting ans drama story"
" Good plot but not great script writing
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,4,I really like the idea of time traveling scripts and the liberty that allows to film making. In this movie everything slots together nicely at the end but I thought the actual script writing wasn't very strong. The acting was really good but the film as a whole was quite one-note.
" This movie is mind bending
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,6,"Okay so I was pretty stoned when I watched this movie and it had absolutely frazzled my mind by the time it ended. Was THC the main benefactor of me tripping out to the twists and turns of Predestination? I don't know. Maybe, but that's not to say this movie isn't mind bending enough on its own.It's hard to talk too deeply about the plot without giving away any of it's twists. We follow Ethan Hawke's character after he has his face melted off by the ""fizzle bomber"", a terrorist he's been chasing through time, which requires him to get a face transplant and become Ethan Hawke. We then see him go back in time to work in a bar, where he strikes up a conversation with Jane, the unmarried mother, who tells him her life story. This part of the movie is completely necessary to set up the upcoming twists, which are easily the highlights of Predestination. However, I personally found it a bit boring and, up until the first twist was revealed, I had absolutely no idea why this random woman's(?) life story had suddenly become centre stage.Some of the twists in the movie are very predictable, but some catch you completely off guard. This might be due to the fact that some of the twists are so outlandish, ridiculous and, well, technically impossible that you'd be considered stupid for predicting them, but this still doesn't stop them from providing a massive upset.Outside of the crazy twists and turns, the movie doesn't offer tonnes of substance (as I said before, the life story of Jane is a bit dull), however, that does not mean there is nothing to enjoy. For me, the twists were enough to firmly hold my interest as I tried to piece the rest of the puzzle together myself, allowing me to feel immersed in the action. However, once the end credits rolled, I couldn't quite get my head around some of the plot details. For instance, the whole paradoxical nature of the plot and the idea of fate playing a part kind of confused me, as the nature of the paradox sort of works against itself in a way and doesn't seem to cause much good when you really think about it, but I'd need a science degree to be able to explain that better.All in all, whilst not exactly perfect (with some slightly dull moments and some details prompting you to question the point of Hawke's entire ""mission""), Predestination will take you on a mind-bending journey, leading you to second guess everything you are seeing just for your concept of reality to be completely shattered again by the next scene. There's a lot to enjoy if you like leaving a movie with your mind completely fried; would recommend to watch stoned."
" Complex?
",2019-09-16 00:00:00,8,"To all the critics that said it was too complex: you should take into account that it was from a book by Robert Heinlein, so yes it is brilliantly complex, and no, to dumb it down for a bunch of movie critics would be sacrilege"
" May just be the best sci-fi / time travel movie of all time
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,10,"I just watched this movie again for the third time tonight and it blew me away just as it did the first time I watched it. And although it's cliche to say, it's absolutely true with this film that everytime you see it you'll catch something new that was missed previously. The story is brilliant and the acting by Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook, and Noah Taylor was just top notch - each of them deserved an Oscar nomination (and no that's not hyperbole).To all the negative reviewers, who either 1. Complain they don't understand the plot, 2. Thought the plot was ""ridiculous"", or 3. Claim the ""twist"" was too ""predictable"", let me tell you why you're all embarrassingly wrong.The ""twist"" is not that the Barkeep and Unmarried mother is the same person, that was pretty much revealed in the first 5 minutes of the film when you see the burnt face of Jane in the explosion being surgically repaired to become the healed face of the Bartender. If this was intended to be the ""twist"", the storytellers would not have Jane's face be so obviously shown in that opening scene. This is where most people are wrong. Furthermore there was plenty of dialogue through the movie that slowly but assuredly reveal and reaffirm this plot point. Also the fact that he/she is the fizzle bomber is not surprising, but it was not meant to be surprising. That wasn't the payoff.The ""twist"" was when Jane's surgeon explained to her after the Cesarean that she is a hermaphrodite (which is a REAL medical condition, so no the plot is not ridiculous). That was the climatic moment of the film, the ""OMG"" moment. It was a gut wrenching scene, one that Sarah Snook did an amazing job in, along with the subsequent scene when she was learning to change her voice and realized she could no longer call herself by her name Jane. What a performance. On first viewing of this film, no one, and I mean NO ONE, could've foresaw that coming. That is the twist, the ingredient, that sets this time travel movie apart from all others and actually makes it work. As Robertson explained to the Bartender, he is special, he is nature's anomaly that enables him uniquely suited for time travel. He has ""no ancestry"" or more precisely a circular ancestry. He is his/her own father/mother/child/grandparent. His whole life, every action taken, was predestined. In a sense his existence ensured there would be no time travel ""grandfather"" paradox. No Marty McFly changing his timeline here! And that is why he is so valued by Robertson and the Bureau.While that was the most important twist in the story, there are 3 others: 1. When we see Jane's lover is herself in 1963, 2. When the Bartender traveled back in time to kidnap the baby to complete the temporal loop, and 3. When the temporal field kit suffered a seemingly unfortunate error/ ""malfunction"" and couldn't decommission. For those who are paying close attention, this was not an accident. This was in fact Robertson sending the Bartender on a final (FINAL but illegal) mission which is why Robertson left him the note ""trace the timer"". One could even take it a step further and suggest that Robertson knew all along that John is the Fizzle bomber, but that his ""terrorist"" acts are just the lesser of two evils, consequences that actually prevented even bigger tragedies and overall saving more lives than taken.Again this a tremendous, all-time great sci-fi/time travel movie, that has you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Screenplay, acting, directing, an amazing tour de force. Go see it again and again, I know I will."

It's basically Jane, little Jane, fizzle bomber, etc. But they're all the same person!! Talk about mind-blowing!! You really need to pay attention in this one. It was deep, emotional, and definitely weird at times. But it is also a very intelligent and well scripted movie. I have never seen anything like it. I would definitely recommend watching at least once. Or maybe twice in case you need to wrap your head around all of the twists and turns and craziness."

I guessed almost everything that was supposed to be a surprise. the final twist did nothing for me because I was already assuming that since he said ""then you understand who I am"" after already wondering about it earlier. There was not a single ""omg moment"" for me. and I know there are certain things you just have to accept when it comes to a time travel paradox, but they just took it to a new level. It just really makes no sense for the same person to be the mother father and daughter. usually time travel stories are a loop that connects the past and the future, this is just a closed loop that connects with itself and nothing else"

It sounded like something some crazy old man made up and would tell you trying to impress you.
It reminded me of the Simpson when Grampa/Ape Simpson tells Lisa and Bart old war storys.
It is just to far fetched, overloaded and tinfoily.
It just made it hard to take the movie serious.
And they spend an hour or in other words the major part of the movie on it.
After that everything just fell in to place just in couple of minutes, just recognizing the outfit and the people told the rest of the movie right after the jump."

" 'Predestination' deserves more recognition.
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,8,"Brilliant. Thought-provoking mind bending brilliance. Coming under the radar and screening on Tuesday night as part of the Toronto After Dark Film Festival schedule, Predestination stars Ethan Hawke (Sinister) in a film that caught us off guard and sent us home with the reality of just witnessing one of the best films of the year. Ethan Hawke plays a character without name who is a time-travelling agent for a secret agency that uses their ability to transport to specific dates as an opportunity to stop crime. Hawkes character (known as The Bartender) is on the tail end of his career. And on his final assignment, he is tasked with stopping the ""Fizzle Bomber"", a terrorist that exploded a bomb in New York City in 1975 that killed over 11,000 citizens. The bartender had a chance to stop the bomber once before but failed and now after a recuperating after his final jump, he jumps from 1960's through the 70's, 80's and 90's to achieve his final objective. The time travel machine used to jump is basic and brilliant in its simplicity - a violin case where the adjustment of the numbered and lettered locking mechanism determines the date to which one will travel. It is during an early jump that Hawkes character finds himself in the 1960's acting as a bartender in a small dive bar. It's here where he meets the character played by Sarah Snook (again, no name is given for the character just the description ""The Unmarried Mother""). The two main characters begin a conversation that is part Tarantino part Mamet in its delivery and genius. The Unmarried Mother begins to weave a tale so unbelievable that it's mesmerizing to hear it unravel. The bartender does not seem as overly surprised at the details and at the conclusion of the anguishing story, he offers the Unmarried Mother an opportunity to go back in time to face the person which caused her such grief. The time jump of the two characters sets the timeline path for a story that goes in directions that will be completely unseen. By the time the Unmarried Mother meets her oppressor and the Bartender confronts the Fizzle Bomber the directing duo of the of Spierig Brothers (Peter and Michael) have laid out a complex plot of intersecting stories best described as a ""snake eating its own tail."" Ethan Hawke has worked with the Spierig Brothers before with 2009's Daybreakers which this reviewer thought was a well above average tale of vampires in a futuristic world. But with Predestination the collaborative efforts of the brothers and Hawke have created a brilliant time travel science fiction film that betters Rian Johnson's Looper in its vision and execution. Predestination is a movie where washroom breaks are not recommended. Every detail of the story circles back to the wonderful final reveal. It's a film that commands attention and then rewards the viewer for the courtesy. When the year finally comes to a close, we will have screened over 200 films released in 2014. Predestination is sure to be on our list of Top 10 when the tallies are constructed."

",2019-05-20 00:00:00,8,"Directed by The Spierig Brothers (Michael and Peter), ""Predestination"" really is the type of film that would require two people to maneuver it. This is due to its linear yet complex script which's paradox makes it extremely unstable, barely sustainable from a narrative point of view. So, after letting the wounds from my brain heal for a few days, I finally decided to write this review.I will keep this spoiler free, which means a few things that I would have liked to say I will not. ""Predestination"" is not your average plot twist film. It does not have one big plot twist close to its end a-la-Shyamalan and, also unlike Shyamalan's films, its quality does not stand only in its plot. It is also from its stellar performances by one of the most consistently good actors in the business, Ethan Hawke playing a bartender (more or less) and the one who truly steals the show, Sarah Snook, portraying a complicated character--this is all I will say for the sake of not spoiling anything. This is the performance of her career, a multi-dimensional, daring portrayal of a tortured soul.So what is the deal with the plot? In short, the plot revolves around a temporal agent going through time to prevent crimes before they happen--yup, time travel. The key here is that the plot can be defined as a perfect circle, ingeniously crafted so that it has no entry point. Chronologically speaking, is like the ""snake that eats its own tail"". From the twist perspective, it slowly unwraps itself, clearing more and more until the final picture, predictably but satisfyingly, completes itself.Apologize for the ambiguity, but know that this is a film which is built on keeping the viewer engaged, and while it had moments when the narrative struggled to keep the logic, it succeeds in the end by staying on the edge of the aforementioned circle. Compared to Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"", another mind-bending work, this film relies on everything going according to plan. Happily, the plan is one hell of a twister in its own right.If you are an attentive viewer, then ""Predestination"" will leave you stupefied and fascinated, and you will feel the need to turn it around in your head over and over again trying to find a gap in its continuity, but trust me, you won't. And to think it started with a pure, newborn baby girl and ended with a psychotic old man."

" A short review of ""Predestination"" (2014)
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,9,"""Predestination"" is a grim, moody, well directed time travel movie, beautifully performed by Sarah Snook, Ethan Hawke and Noah Taylor. The storytelling style reminded me so much of Christopher Nolan's work that I had to check the credits again to make sure he wasn't at the helm. (Coming from me, that's high praise.) I'd rate ""Predestination"" a 9 out of 10.I don't think this movie is for everyone. It's hard-core sci-fi, adapted from a short story by Robert Heinlein called ""- All You Zombies -,"" and its stranger story elements will challenge the viewer instead of of pleasing them emotionally. (This would be a very confusing choice for a date movie, for example.)And there is a major plot element here that requires so much suspension of disbelief that I think many viewers will be put off by it. (And it doesn't involve the plot-enabling time travel tehcnology.) I truly enjoyed this film, and even I struggled with its plausibility. I feel certain it was easier for Heinlein to get across on the page than for any filmmaker to show on screen. (Would any of us react the way these characters do if we were in the same situation? I don't think the human heart works quite the way the story suggests it does.)Still, this was a very good movie for a science fiction fan. If you are in the mood for something dark, different and demanding, then give it a chance."
" I like twists, but not when it's completely ridiculous
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst and overrated Scifi movie.

" Original but Illogical
",2019-02-11 00:00:00,6,"I liked the movie because it was original, BUT it had lots and lots of flaws.
Seems like they just wanted to make a movie that is original and suprises people by its mind bending ending, but they stopped caring about details and logics.I can't mention all of the flaws, as there are many, but here are ""some"" of the flaws ;
1)So, Jane has a physiological problem and has both male and female internal organs (If external, she would already know). This is a VERY RARE condition, and in most people who have it, one or both sex organs are NOT functional. So she couldn't both get pregnant and impregnate.2)Assuming that her male organ worked correctly and was functional (again very illogical and unlikely in her case), she would also have male physical features like facial hair, deeper voice, etc as a teen.3)So she gives birth, and they decide to change her to a man only because she had heavy bleading and they couldn't save her uterus?
Really? That was their solution?
She was bleeding from uterus, not ovaries. And if they removed her uterus, she could still be normal with just ovaries. She just couldn't get pregnant.
Even if they had to remove the ovaries too, they could offer her female HRT (hormone therapy) instead of testosterone. Come on, she's not transgender, she's at it's best just intersex.4)So they realize she has male organs during her labor and when she's under anesthetic drugs? So they see something unique and without sampling or lab tests claim it's a (fully functioning) male organ? What?
And they immediately bring other surgeons in and change her into a man5)Her emotional reaction or shall I say lack of it, is also weird. So she wakes up and they tell her they are changing her into a man ""without her permission"", and she takes it so well without actually being a F2M transgender? And she didn't sue the doctor for that? She didn't get depressed or commit suicide? She didn't ask them to correct this mess? Nothing??!!6)So, she gets pregnant by her male future self, and the baby has no genetic flaws???7)How could she not recognize someone just like her but just with another gender? Didn't she even question they similarity? Cause sex change doesn't change the base of face that much! They could still be able to recognize their extreme similarity.8)How could he (John) fall in lover with himself/herself and in the past? And have sex with her? What?
People rarely fall in love with themselves, besides, even if they do, it's not in a real sexual way. Their attraction was so odd. Also, John knew he's leaving, then why did he date jane? It all happened so fast, when did they have sex to impregnate jane?9)So was the character bisexual? Or was she into men untill she had sex change and then she suddenly got attracted to women?10)So if John takes Jane's baby to the past with time travel, it becomes Jane? That's not how time travel theory works.
Even if you talk about the chicken/egg cycle, the chicken can lay eggs, but cannot become egg itself!!!)11)When John's face got burned in an explosion, how could they manage to change the whole face shape from small squareish round to big and diamond shape face?12)Why would they do such a complicated thing instead of working harder to find the bomber in time?Etc etc."
" Yes, watch this. But watch the film before reading these spoilers .
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,6,"This review has BIG spoilers. If you have an interest in this movie, I'd advise you to go ahead and watch it first because a lot of the fun here comes with the surprises. Maybe read this afterwards and see if you agree with me?Not quite as good as its high IMDB score, it's not far off though. The actors do fine, especially Snook in a very odd part, and everything else is good except for the three major flaws listed below.One: It's based on a short story written in 1958 by Robert Heinlein (classic SF writer for any who don't know). All the time-periods in the movie (except for 1945) were Heinlein's visions of his future, but all of them are in our past. Therefore we know that the future he envisioned (e.g. female-only sex workers in space to service all-male astronauts - and a whole lot of other chauvinist stuff which Heinlein was generally known for) didn't happen. The film-makers have chosen to follow these aspects of the story closely, thereby transforming what Heinlein intended as reasonably realistic SF into what for us is an unreal, sometimes absurd, alternate-reality fantasy. Paradoxically, following the story closely has produced an effect its original author did not intend, and it wouldn't have been hard to make the story work with secret time-agents operating through the real past we know. Or indeed to shift it into our future.Two: The previous objection was to following aspects of the original too closely. Paradoxically again, this one is about NOT following it. Like so many movies based on books or stories, this isn't as good as the original. This is chiefly because it loses focus by adding the yawn-worthy bomber sub-plot, which: is banal and ordinary compared with what is going on elsewhere; has little to do with the original story; was presumably included to introduce fights and violence and make the movie more 'exciting'; and makes no sense. This is particularly sad because the original extraordinary story always made perfect sense. It would have been far better to follow it and concentrate more carefully on what the story was about.Three: One of the major revelations is that Hawke and Snook are playing the same character. There's a lot of explanation to try and make this believable - the face was burned and had to be reconstructed, the vocal cords were damaged, changing the voice, etc. However film-makers ignore the fact that Hawke is six inches taller than Snook. The height difference is obvious throughout and actually referred to in the script at one point, making the whole notion ridiculous, so it just feels like a cheat when it's revealed. Yes, these actors are good in their parts, but it can't have been beyond the casting department's capabilities to find two people of roughly the same size when it's so central to the plot. This makes as much sense as casting Steve Buscemi as Muhammad Ali. He'd have done a better acting job than Will Smith because he's a better actor, but it just wouldn't be believable on physical grounds.This review concentrates on the negatives. To re-iterate, this is a good and entertaining movie based on an interesting 50s SF premise and well worth a watch, even if you do know what's going to happen (or in this case maybe it happened already!)"
" Ludicrous plot.

" A Really Good Cerebral Time Travel Adventure Requiring More Than One Visit
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,9,"21 November 2017. Ethan Hawke stars as a time traveler to prevent major crime from happening. He and a woman are separately introduced to a Space Corp for women which requires some blind acceptance on the part of the audience until a reasonable explanation occurs about a third of the way into the movie. Like Point of No Return (1993) with Bridget Fonda, there is a lot of character development during the first part of the movie, though not quite as exciting and thrilling as Fonda's experience compared Sarah Snook's character in this movie. Her experience continued to be shrouded in much more mystery. Her flashback, recollection of her past, was presented fairly decently and the mystery to her story was sufficient to retain an interest in the story even without the action of Fonda's character's somewhat more intense rebellious attitude. However, what makes this particular movie stand out is its relevance to the contemporary social mores of the times and how the twist in this movie provides some insight into the current tension being felt in today's society, though to say too much more would be to reveal too much to the audience. Additionally, the script is character-driven, so much more than most sci fi action,/// adventures, including mysterious relationships and innocent pure love.This is also a science fiction movie about adoption and even kidnapping and yet the story flows well, incorporating these themes and enhances the audience's appeal to and concern for the characters in the movie. At the same time, the level attraction towards Snook's character is of some revealing importance and, for the most, is sustained of which she deserves some credit due to her appealing as well as revealing performance and it almost takes up half the movie at that. The reveal of this movie is striking and in some ways quite poignant. The next scene, reveals some pretty poor shooting skills, a rather distracting and irritating revelation, perhaps unfortunately necessary for how the script was written and almost borders on laziness and lack of creativity yet is also includes a double reveal that quite compelling in itself. The use of the time paradoxes are quite strong in this movie and the director doesn't shy away from it. Yet by the end of the movie, it seems that the whole movie comes full circle, unless one is smart, so that at least two viewing are recommended or just go to Wikipedia instead for answers."
" One of the most mindblowing time-travel movies in history
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,10,"When I watched ""Predestionation"" for the first time, I was like WTF did I just see? Now we show that movie to friends from time to time. And when they ask: ""what is it about?"" - I can only tell them, that it's a movie about time travel. Everything else would be too much to say here.What I love about the movie: it has a very long and quite ""slow"" - I call it - prologue. So in the first hour of the movie, some of the viewers may say: ""hey, that's no time travel movie, it's just some sort of drama"". Yes, that may be true - but just wait for it and watch and listen carefully.
In the second half of the movie, the pace increases. And wow, how it increases. You literally run from one WTF moment to the next. When you get to the first one you think ""aaaah, that's twist here"". And yep, you're right - but wait, there's a lot more.And I think, that is one of the biggest plus in that movie (others don't like that but I really do): in the first half, the viewer is left a bit confused about what he sees and then he just get's this ""aaaaah"" moments on and on. I don't think there is a better scripting to get there than in this movie. At least none that cinephile people does not already know from a lot of other movies.When it came to the acting, I really like Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook. They both play very good and convincing. Somehow I like Snooks role a bit better here, as it is more versatile and complex to play. And she absolutely delivers here.I also like the setting, the coloring, the used thechnique. Some say they like more modern equip and a modern setting. I on the other side really like the idea, that time travel is not invented somewhere in the future, but in the past. And in that case the whole setting is nicely made.One last thing: if you finished the movie, just watch it again and use your knowledge you have now. And you'll laugh when you see all these many winks (some even with the fence post) that lead to the climax. It's all there in the first half of the movie. You just need to see it. So: it's easy to watch this movie several times. Just do it :)"

",2018-12-28 00:00:00,5,"Predestination is a mind-bender. This movie offers an interesting twist on the time-travel genre. However, it takes so long to get where it's going that it becomes predictable. Sarah Snook and Ethan Hawke are good, but their performances are bogged down by the story and the pacing. I almost liked this movie at the beginning and the end, but it lost me somewhere in the middle."

" Who are we and what is predetermined.
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,8,Well I would have to say that for a 90 minute show the last 30 minutes was more powerful than the first hour. The show begins with an explosion leading to a timewarp of the future. Ethan Hawke plays a magnificent character however the first 60 minutes is literally and orientation that is both boring long and very disconnected. Until the end of the movie where the actual twist is experienced the huge dialogue of just the two main characters can become quite lethargic. I strongly recommend that you listen to every word that is said between the two main characters at the bar as it will give you an insight as to what actually will come at the end of the movie. While I appreciate the reasoning behind the very long two cast conversation The last 30 minutes does explain the whole story the quest being that everything is predetermined and that person we think we are is actually a person that we do not believe we are. I was going to give this movie a one out of 10 but the ending definitely makes this a movie to watch

" Good and unique but ""too unique"" as in too complicated
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,7,"I think it was when i saw a trailer on my TV program tha i put this one on my watchlist, as the genre and Hawk caught my attention. That being said, i don't regret my decision in any way and i enjoyed the movie but i found it too confusing for the viewer as it gets more and more perplexed as the time passes and it's hard to comprehend what you see. First of all the movie has a mixed identity because the first half is completely different from the other. I found myself wondering if i remember correctly that this is a sci-fi movie about time travel because i was watching a long two sided scene that can only be described as a casual drama with the story narrated and then BAM! It transitioned in the most confusing time travel movie.So to put it in one sentence to show how extreme the plot is, it goes like this: Girl is born, she grows up to find out she has both gender organs, becomes a man(against her will on that note*), meets a man that it's her in the future, they(same person x2) travel back in time, the man version meets the woman version and they make a babe that -wait for it- it's again her! So okay, the twist is great and huge. But is it too huge maybe just for the sake of it? I won't even begin to try to explain the paradox in the plot and potential holes because it's already so difficult.*Strange time continuum things aside, i found it weird that they forced Jane to become a man, having surgery when she didn't even know about that. In many movies(and in real life) we see a person that is born with the wrong hormones or both organs but it's them who decide if they fell wrong about it and which person they prefer to be. This time i saw a normal girl who despite the fact that she liked to brawl like a boy she didn't have the wrong feeling about her sexuality or liking women so even the fact that John wanted to hook up with Jane is explained only as he was in love with himself or something like that.Anyways, i found the theme interesting and enjoyable for the most part and it was intriguing until it went too far just for the big twist so i see it like a missed opportunity for something greater. Whoever watches it prepare to be mindblown and mindf... you know. But it will be in your perspective if you will love or the movie or if it will just pass you by without overthinking it. 7/10"

" Unusual, original time travel tale combines sci-fi and noir elements but features a twist ending more speciously clever than meaningful
",2018-10-25 00:00:00,6,"An unusual Australian import, Predestination features an odd combination of sci fi and film noir elements. The film stars Ethan Hawke as a time travelling ""temporal agent"" who belongs to a shadowy government agency in 1985 attempting to prevent the evil ""Fizzle Bomber"" from setting off a bomb in New York City in 1975 which results in the murder of over 10,000 people. The film is based on a 1959 short story by Robert Heinlein entitled ""-All You Zombies-.""
The story starts off with a bang as the temporal agent is severely injured when one of the Fizzle Bomber's bombs explodes in his face requiring facial reconstruction surgery. In his new identity, the agent goes back to NYC in 1970 where he works as a barkeep (the character is identified with that name in the credits). There he meets a bar patron identified as ""The Unmarried Woman,"" a True Confessions writer played by Australian actress Sarah Snook.
Snook steals the show as a woman who undergoes a sex change operation and is now a man, recounting a sad but absorbing tale of how she arrived at her present circumstances. Her story begins as an infant left on the doorsteps of a Cleveland orphanage in 1945 by a mysterious man. She grows up as ""Jane,"" a shy but brilliant young woman who applies for an early 60s space program entitled Space Corps.
The women there are groomed as glorified ""Comfort women,"" The plot twists grow exponentially as Jane is forced to leave the program after getting pregnant by another mysterious man with whom she falls in love but who suddenly disappears. While delivering her baby, the doctors discover she has vestigial male sex organs and they're forced to operate, changing her into a man. If that's not surprising enough, soon her baby is kidnapped from the hospital which leaves Jane (now ""John"") shattered and bereft.
At this point the story is fully engaging but soon the focus shifts to Hawke's character. He offers the newly minted John a chance to take revenge on the man who got her pregnant and then disappeared if John agrees to take over the agent's job. When John jumps back into time, he meets his earlier self as Jane and falls in love with her. John impresses Jane by constantly ""guessing"" what she's thinking. John realizes now that he's the mysterious stranger who got Jane pregnant and then suddenly left her.
Even more bizarre is the big reveal that it's the temporal agent who steals Jane's baby from the hospital and brings her back to orphanage. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. That creates the paradox that Jane, John and their baby, are the same person!
If that's not enough, the Temporal Agent returns to 1975 to help the agent who's injured by the Fizzle Bomber's bomb. That agent is actually John so we now realize that John is the same person as the temporal agent but due to the paradox of time travel, they both fell in love with Jane, their former self.
Hawke as the Temporal Agent after facial reconstruction, gets to finally save the day by going back in time and killing his future self, the Fizzle Bomber. Instead of the big explosion killing thousands in NYC in 1975, Hawke's Temporal Agent ends up saving thousands of lives along (I guess) a newly created timeline.
You might actually have to watch the film a second time to understand everything that's happening (or even read the Wikipedia plot summary!). I get the whole idea that Hawke's character is competing with Snook's for the love of their former self. But why go through this whole thing of kidnapping the baby and ensuring that all the principals are the same person?
The plot summary in Wikipedia explains it-but I'm still uncertain whether this is a satisfying explanation. Actually it's Robertson, the head of the temporal agency that has engineered the creation of ""an agent who has no ties to time. This ""perfect"" temporal agent was responsible for both his own conception and death."" Without all these machinations, the temporal agent will end up as the Fizzle Bomber, who has become deranged due to time travel. There would be no one left to finish him off had Hawke's ""perfect"" temporal agent not been perfected through all the selective inbreeding.
In the end, Predestination is designed simply to shock by the introduction of a clever but specious twist ending. Contrast that with another time traveling tale such as ""Back to the Future,"" where the underlying premise has an overarching theme: the restoration of masculinity formerly denied. No such theme emerges here. Still, the bulk of the film, which chronicles the fascinating tale of an intersex character, sets this time travel tale as a decent enough entry in the pantheon of such a genre, due to the unusual history and pedigree of such an androgynous character."
" oh boy....must watch movie before you got a time machine

" Nodestination
",2018-10-14 00:00:00,6,"Predestination is a highly engaging film that constantly teases the audience and gives just enough hints to make us feel smart when we figure something out, even though it's actually really obvious. On a minute-to-minute basis it is very entertaining and if my score were based on that alone this could be an 8, or even 9, out of 10. What holds it back, however, is the lack of satisfying resolution. Technically, that was the intention of the filmmakers, but it feels more like they wrote themselves into a dead end they didn't know how to resolve. Trying to describe what frustrates me about this film makes me think of a Michael Caine quote from 'The Prestige': ""Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called ""The Pledge"". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. [...] The second act is called ""The Turn"". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. [...] But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call ""The Prestige"".""Predestination does not have a Prestige, which is what holds it back from being a truly great trick. It just leaves you feeling empty.I recommend watching it. It's well directed, it has good acting, good dialogue, and good visuals, but the story leaves something to be desired."

",2018-10-01 00:00:00,7,"Unexpected gem. Very dark and moody, filmed in Melbourne which is great. Interesting time travel aspect, gets you to think about it and how it would occur. The barman, Ethan, is rugged and I loved his acting. There is a gender bending theme too, makes you feel for people born with both genders, not sure the name. It also brings up a great point - it's never too late to become what you would've been. Great point. Liked the fizzbomber bits. Sarah snook did a great job. Amazingly not even credited by Foxtel who I would like to do a gender reassignment on. Retro vibe too was good, based on a book called 'we are all zombies' or something, maybe read that first."

The writer of the book is a genius and the director succeed to translate it into movie. From innocence, misunderstood then to suffering, and turns into disturbing person, we saw the whole life of Jane. I like this idea of infinite looping, nobody can tell if the scenario makes sense or not. I still think of this movie. It is so deep and tragic."

" An Instant Buy
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,10,"Predestination is one of those science fiction films that perfectly exemplifies everything that confuses and fascinates me about time travel. It's both brilliantly cerebral and mind bogglingly complex. But the movie tightly tells the complex story in 90 minutes, without sacrificing any nuance. It's one of the few movies that I can say I instantly knew I was going to buy the blu-ray right after the credits rolled. Among the many impressive aspects to the story, is the story-telling structure. It feels equally part Nolan and Kubrickian, with a bit of a David Lynch/David Fincher vibe mixed in. However most importantly, Predestination feels like an original film bolstered by performances from the always great Ethan Hawke, as well as the career making turn from Sarah Snook. The depths both of them take their roles, but particularly Snook, is fascinating. And surprisingly neither of them were considered for Oscar noms in 2015. In short, Predestination is one of the best sci-fi's of the last decade.10/10"
" One of the best time travel films you'll see
",2018-06-27 00:00:00,10,"Based on the short 1959 novel, Predestination stars Ethan Hawke as an agent working for a secret organisation that prevents crimes from happening. Disguised as a 70's barman, he looks for information regarding a very dangerous bomber nicknamed ""The Fizzle Bomber"". He meets an isolated person who feels disconnected from society and straight away you think this person is the suspect. It takes a completely different direction by focusing on a solid story rather than the action routine that we are so used to seeing in time travel films. The majority of it is told in flashbacks via conversation between these two characters. The time periods have a very authentic feel to them jumping back and forth from the 1940s, 60s, 70s and 80s. It gets off to a slow start but it becomes a highly engrossing film where we feel a solid connection to these characters. It will keep you thinking all the time with its constant twists and turns. Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook are so convincing they give the film a lot of edge and intrigue. These two actors really play off of each other and the chemistry is flawless. However there are a few unusual choices some characters make, but the writers do their best to explain a lot of these things which I won't spoil here. It's about time travel so there is bound to be plot holes and a lot of confusion but through great editing and the occasional exposition dialogue, they manage to pull it off. It's a great technical achievement from the makeup, costume design, set design, editing and sound effects. With fully fleshed out characters, great acting from everyone and the sometimes witty dialogue, Predestination is a well made film worthy of a sequel."
" I wish I could watch Predestination again for a first time

" It gets you where it counts
",2018-06-06 00:00:00,10,So this could have gone horribly wrong if they chose to hide the major plot point instead they focused on building the viewers empathy towards the different characters so the progression of the storyline seemed inevitable and understandable or some may say predestined.
" An interesting idea, done quite well
",2018-05-28 00:00:00,7,"I was so confused with the first half of this movie. I thought it was meant to be a sci-fi time travel thriller. But we get this biographical story for a large part of the running time. It's engaging, but makes you wonder - where is all this leading? What is this movie even about? Is this the right disc I inserted?Ultimately, I don't think it has any one clear message or point. But it's thought-provoking. It asks a lot of interesting ""what if"" questions. There are plenty of surprises and twists. It raises moral questions about the costs when trying to save lives. And about doing things which cause pain but knowing that you have to do them anyway. One underlying thread is the eternal question of the chicken and the egg and of male vs. female.The movie doesn't really make sense when deeply scrutinised. But it doesn't have to. The plot holds together, but it's unrealistic. But that's okay. It's abstract. It's about pondering these made-up ideas. It takes hypothetical time travel scenarios to their logical extreme. It could've been more concrete and had more of a connection to some kind of purposeful series of events, but it's works for what it is.The acting and directing are good. I like the tone overall. It's an easy movie to relax into, not trying too hard to entertain or preach or blow you away. It just takes you in with a fascinating story which raises a lot of questions. I can't remember the music, meaning it probably did its job without being either terrible or great.So I recommend this movie to people who like intricate stories with well-developed characters. However, it doesn't really lead anywhere profound. It's more about the journey itself and some general themes about existence, choice and identity. It's more of an interesting dream than a realistic story which can be taken seriously. And it's flawed and maybe even a little self-indulgent. But at least it's pretty unique and well made."
" The best Time Travel movie:
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,9,"If you like time travel paradoxes this is the movie for you. I have seen many movies about time travel but most of them follow the same pattern. This movie is different. Mostly because it's exploring a very unique time travel paradox. It's reminiscent of the ""Song of Storms"" time travel paradox from the Zelda video game franchise.All I can say is that this movie will blow your mind with it's paradox. It's so original and intellectually stimulating. At the end everything falls perfectly into place. Or does it?...p.s. I'm actually writing a sci-fi novel about time travel myself so I just watched the movie to get some ideas.Final verdict: a must-watch if you like movies about time travel"
" Sick, perverted, mental, mind-bending gem of a movie
",2018-05-17 00:00:00,10,"As a fan of time travel movies, I've always wanted the exploration of a true paradox. What if someone had the ability to travel through time and affect your life at various stages and successfully put you in a time loop? Once such a mission was accomplished, you should never really be able to get out of it.Spoiler AlertPredestination takes this concept and pretty much spanks your brain with it. Not only is the victim in a time loop but crucially, he is convinced that his existence is dependent on the successful continuation of the loop itself. The opposite of going back in time, killing your father and causing yourself to never have existed at all. Why would you not perpetuate your circular existence if you were convinced that it was the only way you could ever exist?As far as the question as to where the loop begins, the only scenario that makes sense to me where the baby taken by the Barkeep to the orphanage is not mother Janes child but is in fact baby Jane herself swiped by Robertson from her real parents and switched with mother Janes child. All the Barkeep is then doing is taking his infant self from the ward to the orphanage.Convince the Barkeep that he is 'special' and born of a Paradox and that it's his mission to perpetuate his existence and he will keep completing the loop, endlessly, forever."
" Fantastic science-fiction that stands up to scrutiny.
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,8,"'Predestination (2014)' is a fantastic time-travel film that stands up to scrutiny even on multiple watches. It is an unpredictable story that's riveting from start to finish. The narrative starts off slowly, seemingly insignificant for much of the run-time, but then a sudden change in pace and some major plot reveals shift all that came before and make each frame wholly necessary. It really is a surprisingly, and satisfyingly, complex yet cohesive story. The circles it makes make perfect sense. The flick has a much lower budget than most features, yet stands tall due to its fantastic script which proves it really is all in the writing. This should be seen by every fan of science-fiction or time-travel. 8/10"

" Wow
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,8,"I will try not to spoil it but the first half of the film was pretty long, boring, and drawn out. I almost turned it off because I took it as another LGBT propaganda film, but after watching it, it's not. The second half of the film is where the mind bending plot magic starts to happen. I am a fairly intelligent person and I found myself guessing, second guessing, and guessing wrong every time. There's no way these bad reviewers could possibly know the plot before it unfolds and I believe just the very premise of the plot makes them uncomfortable. It is, umm, weird, to say the least.I deducted two stars because the first half of the film is so boring and empathy begging, and when I re-watch the film, I will more than likely find myself skipping the first half, which will leave me with a 45 minute movie. The last 45 minutes however, are worth all eight stars. Definitely recommend watching, and definitely recommend watching without reading the spoilers. Also, disregard the bad reviews. I've read them and they really don't make any valid points against it other than that it makes them uncomfortable or they think it's weird or predictable. Weird, yes, big deal so what, but predictable? Not the least"
" Thin and Small
",2018-03-30 00:00:00,6,"A mediocre film that is not holding up well. I judge all art at least partially by how well it holds up over time. This film is not holding up well. The second view was much more disappointing than the first. Other issues are the horrible makeup job for the older Jane. It looks like a child did it or maybe a cheap face painting job at the fair. How did that get the okay?The overall story is a decent concept, but it's rather obvious, and presented in a only a moderately compelling manner.I think the acting is the bright spot in the film. Not a weak performance any where. Why not go deeper into the ""solving the big bombing"" story line? That could have brought real edge to the movie. Too much time spent on trying to set up the big reveal which everyone has figured out half way through the film. Sorry, no ""sixth sense"" stunner here gang."

Wtf were they thinking, honestly ? And that's JUST on top of the total nonsense of it all... Can i go back in time PLEASE and not watch it ?"
" Worst movie I've seen in a some time
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,1,"Major disappointment. This is one of those movies which has great potential but where the ""engine"" blows apart at the start line. It almost seems ""nonsense"" was the major topic, rejecting all forms of ""logic"".
For starters its completely unoriginal in that it seeks to show that ""time"" is circular, that one cannot change the future (where haven't we seen that before?) even given time travel. In this regard I thought 12 Monkeys was the best one to showcase this, compared to which Predestination comes off as a sad joke.Its good until about the first half before falling apart and stops making any form of sense.The barkeep gets ""John"" to tell his story in order to confirm its the fizzle bomber (to-be). Why the barkeep doesn't just kill the future fizzle bomber right there is utterly nonsensical as he then proceeds to helping in ""creating"" the bomber. This is the first element in the plot which fails since the Barkeep's only reason for existence at that point is to stop the fizzle bomber.John's storytelling ends on the utter and complete pain and misery felt since the man she (Jane) loved disappeared and how he (John) would love to kill that person, without any doubt or contrition, as a spectator you can almost sense the lust for blood and destruction. And when given the chance to take his/her revenge and realizing that the man who disappeared and caused all that grief was her future male-self, instead of breaking the chain of events, John willingly and knowlingly indulges in history's most amoral love story, and further even has sex with herself and procreates (again, fully knowing of the consequences, ie, the future that unfolds).The barkeep kidnaps Jane and John's ""self-cloned"" baby for reasons unknown, its a needed element in the plot, but it doesn't have any actual justification. At that point the barkeep doesn't know about his 'true' identity yet and has thus no attachment to the baby from what seems two other people.And finally, when the movie does by chance almost manage to get itself back on its feet and towards a good ending, it fails again. When the Barkeep meets his future self and realizes he's the fizzle bomber, instead of again breaking the chain (by committing suicide), he just gives in to 'destiny' and just kills his future self and starts. It also fails to explain why one would need to bomb many to avoid future bigger disasters, in the context of time-travel whereby the Barkeep could find out the single culprit and take him out with a single bullet. We understand that constant time-jumping turns him into a deranged lunatic but still. And then, the final touch, remembering who he was before his facial reconstruction which was meant to tie everything together, fails miserably. Its completely unnecessary and only goes to the disadvantage of the possible appreciation of this movie.I will never watch another movie from the Spierig Brothers and I'm really starting to doubt Ethan Hawke's choice of movies to star in.In conclusion I'd say they tried to do something, it had great potential but they invariably crapped on it big time. I'd give it 0 star if I could, highly unrecommended and worth a re-do."
" Gotta admit: Tore my head apart
",2018-02-16 00:00:00,10,"By now it should be impossible for a time-travel movie NOT to induce a yawn. How many of the damn things are there now?But this one actually took my breath away. It's got it all: Good production, good writing, great acting and direction, and an artistic sensibility that stretches from decent action to compelling parlor drama.No spoilers, but bear in mind it treads the same basic territory as Gilliam's ""Twelve Monkeys""; that time travel is fundamentally indistinguishable from reality severance. If you found that cool in Gilliam, you'll find it at least as cool, and probably more cool, here.And... It's a truly touching story. You might cry, if your emotional responses can find the berth amid the bizarre wonder at the temerity of the premise as it unfolds and jumps headlong into the impossible possible.No question. Sci-fi fan?: Check it out."
" A Movie that will have your Mind in Circles
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,8,"This film is very confusing at times. Yet, it's a confusion that you love, sort of like what you get from a movie like Inception. A film where you can't wait for the credits to roll so you can start thinking what the hell actually happened. This movie is supposed to be confusing... it deals with time travel for crying out loud. You should know what to expect from a movie that involves time travel. If you like movies that don't tell you it all, that challenge you as a viewer, that keeps you guessing the whole time, and that will inevitably require you to do some kind of retrospective research or reflection... this movie is definitely for you. The movie isn't perfect, it has a few flaws but overall, I found it to be a very enjoyable movie experience. Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook do exceptionally well too!"

" It lacks common sense
",2018-01-13 00:00:00,3,"In a nutshell. You beget yourself with yourself & time travel to plant yourself in past! I agree with the liberties taken in Sci-fi movies, but total lack of common sense.I gave 3 stars for the tempo built & curiosity created but towards the end a total let down."
" A Serious Plot Dilemma
",2018-01-11 00:00:00,3,"I thought it was an interesting film, and I will be the first to admit the acting was amazing - 
My problem is the circular plot without resolution - Yeah, meeting yourself in the past to go back to the past before you were transgender to impregnate yourself to....Wow - You're supposed to be chasing the ""Fizzle"" bomber (such a harbinger of the ending) - and, yet, you never stop him, or do you, or could this all have been stopped had you only realized you could stop yourself? 
The other GLARING mistake: The spoiler here is rich - 
You go back in time to meet your former self, you were once a woman, but now a fertile male, and you convince your younger male self to go back in time to impregnate your former female self with a baby that ends up being kidnapped and placed at the steps of an orphanage - and then we discover that the baby is the female to male to you genesis - 
This is impossible as matter does not appear - the baby needed to come from somewhere other than itself - 
The idea of the chicken or egg coming first or the snake eating its own tail (Ouroboros) plays a major part in the theme, but - the chicken, the egg and the snake, cannot come from nowhere and create itself - 
This was the only glaring plot hole that bothered me - other than a 52 minute exposition flashback which was frustrating as I kept hoping they'd get the bomber before he...oh, wait, yeah, the bomber was at a bar talking to himself about his former self when he...she got pregnant by himself and the baby was stolen and became him - 
I like a true psychological thriller - and this one missed a major plot-point which ruins the ideology and message -"
" Predestination or a manipulated time-line?
",2018-01-11 00:00:00,8,"This is a highly unusual science-fiction film about time travel. It is somewhat slow and plodding during the first part of the movie, but grows more interesting as the story progresses. The plot becomes absolutely captivating during the last half hour of the film. The special effects are cheap, but great special effects are totally unnecessary in this case. The acting is excellent. This is masterful story-telling, and great entertainment."
" Do not watch this pile of trash
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,2,"This move is pure nonsense and you should not watch it. The story is maddeningly awful and makes absolutely zero sense. I am blaming Christopher Nolan and Inception for this new ""genre"" I will call out-smarting yourself. At least Inception had some logic and reason to it. Predestination, on the other had, is literally a non-sensical web of time travel that in essence has nothing to do with preventing crimes. In my estimation, it's more like some sickos fantasy to play God and screw with the main character. I'm seriously you guys. Don't watch it!"
" Promising beginning, impossible ending
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,6,"*** There will be spoilers ***
Interesting from the beginning, story becomes better and better as The Barkeep's (a.k.a. temporal agent) and John's story becomes intertwined, but in the end there is one major thing making everything impossible: No matter how they jump, there can be no baby Jane, Jane and John at the same time. First there must be a baby so that it grows up as Jane. But there can be no baby without both John and Jane. Even with the time machine the constellation is impossible. It may all be possible (we could talk more about Jane, John and Barkeep and if it can or can not play like that) if only the baby originated from somebody else. Without this ""snake that eats one's tail"" situation, and ""what is older chicken or egg"" repetition throughout the movie (check Trivia section - it is full of that kind of insinuations) I would rate it a nine. But no, they had to be too clever. So I rate it six out of ten."
" A dismal fail
",2017-12-18 00:00:00,1,Predestined is easily predictable and at best is an uncreative replicate of all movies trying way to hard to fit into the same category as Inception. If you're interested in wasting 1 hr and 37min of your life. Then I recommend this movie.
" Great idea, poorly executed.
",2017-12-17 00:00:00,3,"Almost all movies and shows will include some exposition scene, even those with complete mastery of the film or TV medium like Coen brothers and David Chase will occasionally include a scene that has no relevance other than to advance some aspect of the plot. However, half-way through Predestination you realise that the movie is just one big long exposition scene. And the vessel through which they convey this story is at best, poor, at worst, incredibly contrived: Woman walks into a bar and says to barman ""I have a really good story to tell you,"" barman says ""that's interesting, please tell."" From then on almost the entire plot is driven from narration. To quote Brian Cox in Adaptation, ""God help you if you use voice-over in your work, my friends. God help you. That's flaccid, sloppy writing."" And sadly this movie is a prime example.The writers also got a little carried away with the plot-twists. They are 4 major plot twists, and by the fourth, they are really flogging a dead horse. And plot revelations become increasingly more banal and contrived. The writers also leave no room for interpretation or for the viewer to come to the conclusion themselves. This move is as subtle as a block-splitter.Don't get me wrong, the story is inventive, and certainly brings a new twist to the clich√©d and overused, ""man goes back in time to change the past and right some wrong"" storyline. However by the end of the film I didn't feel the audio-visual experience delivered anything extra than reading the script would have."
" Disregards basic concepts of science and twists suck
",2017-12-11 00:00:00,1,"So I won't criticize the whole time travel portion of the story since I'm of the belief that you can do whatever you want with time travel in a movie as long as it follows the logic you set up for it in your story. What I will criticize is the science behind one of the big twists. Since this will involve spoilers, there's the warning up top, and then I'll leave some space after this sentence so that you can avoid it. Ready? Here we go...There is no possible way that any human can go back in time and give birth to themselves. I'll give you the fact that if it was possible for an individual that has both sex organs to impregnate themselves (most recent studies have shown that there would be a dominant sex organ so one or the other would function exactly the way its supposed to), there would be no way for someone to be able to give birth to themselves (unless they were the already fertilized egg that was implanted into a host body). You would create an entirely new human. An idiotic twist that defies any semblance of logic that was simply made to be a ""bet you didn't see that coming"" moment (God knows this movie needed one of those considering all the other twists were easy to guess). Ugh, this movie sucked. The plot doesn't kick into gear until almost two thirds into the movie, the twists all come rapid fire after that (and if you've seen even one time travel movie involving crime in the past, you'll guess all them). Avoid at all cost."
" a stylish, compelling, taut portrait of the nature of destiny
",2017-12-07 00:00:00,9,"Time travel films are always going to be a tough watch, requiring meticulous crafting and supreme attention to detail from the producers and supreme concentration from the viewers. Those that play fast and loose swiftly lose credibility, and you don't get as much out of the film if you expect a ride you can switch off for. our reality, our very existence has, as far as we know, a very linear relationship with time, whatever it really is. we experience it and travel through it in a very specific and stable way, in one direction. Time travel is one of the ultimate realms of science fiction, because it is so far removed from this existence we dwell in. and yet, exploring it and playing with it, can inform us and help us learn about our own reality; it can help us understand the limits and parameters of this life we are born into.this film explores that in some detail, through the lens of time travel, which is a key aspect of the film but through which the real meat and potatoes of the film comes into sharp focus - a study of people, of what drives them, of the trials and tribulations they face, the way they interact with people, the way they change over time, the way experiences shape them, the way they influence those around them, the way they change the world, and the way the world changes them.the sound design is important, with dialogue clear, vital actions emphasised by excellent recordings and sound effects which carry weight, have a real punch and a kick, immersing you further; the score is excellent, full of drama and emotion but not domineering, merely reinforcing the events on screen; the dialogue is compellingly delivered by the excellent cast and the story is tightly woven and built with a slow but inexorable pace, adapted from a short story by Heinlein, perhaps best known for Starship Troopers, and beyond the macguffin of very real time travel, invented in our past no less, the mechanics of which is not explained or explored in any way, is believable and grounded, lacking the pyrotechnics some stories of this ilk resort to; the acting is impassioned and natural; finally, the cinematography, camera angles and editing is crisp and very deliberate, complementing the sound design, and the set design and props are also very deliberate and carefully prepared, arranged and lived in for the film. it all combines to produce a world you are looking in on, not a show set up for our entertainment, not an artificial environment but what feels like a real one.all of this is to create the revelation of the denouement and all that it implies and reveals, and it is worth it. Outstanding film, which I imagine will be further enlightening on subsequent viewings considering its nature."

I watched the whole thing thinking it might add up. Don't waste you time like I did. Total crap. The circular loop of the plot and scenes are meant to keep you locked in. Except neither the scenes themselves as cinema and the disconnectedness of them are worth the time it takes to watch this silly piece of crap."
" starts slow but gets interesting
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,7,"As soon as the opening credits for this movie rolled, I noticed that it had its roots in Australia. I reminded myself to be patient with the plot unfolding, as Aussie movies tend to be deliberate in how they spell out their tales. They are definitely not the instant gratification type movies that are made in North America.Having said, that, it takes over half of the movie for Ethan Hawke's bartender character to hear the story of the mysterious androgynous patron. We then learn that Hawke's character is not there by coincidence, but instead to give the patron, better known as the Unmarried Mother, a chance to go back in time and alter the course of his/her life.The story then takes off, with time travel and characters not being what they seem at first glance becoming the norm. There are definitely hints of INCEPTION and LOOPER that follow, but in a more subtle way. Worth watching to the end."
" This is an overlooked, wonderful gem of a movie.
",2017-11-16 00:00:00,10,"I read the short story this is based on as a kid about 40 years ago 'All You Zombies', I was blown away. When I was rereading it I looked up some facts on it at WikiP. I was surprised to see a movie had been made based on it. Amazon had it with their Prime Service so I watched it right away.This is one good movie! It remains quite faithful to the book, even down to many of the dialog lines pulled directly from it. It's well done, well shot and very entertaining to watch. Sarah Snook is absolutely amazing.***SPOILERS AHEAD ***Sarah Snook places the main character as a young woman Jane, then again after her sex change as John. While you can tell there is something effeminate looking about Young John, Snook does an amazing job of acting like a man, from gestures to postures, she does a completely convincing acting job of making you believe she really is a man. In one scene she plays both parts in the same scene sitting across a table from each other (watch the movie or read the story to find out how) and the difference is amazing. The mannerisms are there and the bearing is all there. She IS a woman one one side of the screen and is a man on the other side.Some liberties were taken with the story line here and there but does a great job of sticking to the story as written. Another twist about the Elder John being the villain is added to fill out the story and really does add something extra to the movie. Had the author of the story thought of it I am sure he would have done it too.There is also a minor change about the young John having a face transplant due to a major burn injury and Middle John is therefore played by a different actor. I imagine this was to keep the audience from knowing the truth of the characters identity and also so that Sarah Snook would not have to play all 4 characters. That would be a MAJOR feat and effort on her part and I doubt even with makeup that she could have pulled it off.It's a great watch!"
" A mind-blowing complete circle
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,9,"Good:Perfectly explores and utilizes the time-travel plot and its paradoxes. Very good acting and directing. An overall complete, unique and surprisingly WTF sci-fi movie.Bad:The long dialogue in the early first half can be draggy."
" What is created out of fear creates more fear
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,8,"This film, on a spiritual level, is about what happens when choices in one's life are chosen out of fear. The spiritual teaching in this regard is very simple but profound - what you create out of fear in your life perpetrates yet more fear; it is a fear loop, with unending consequences throughout one's life. The only way to break the pattern is through love, which is the opposite of fear. The fizzle bomber component of John, toward the end of the film, asks for love. Does he receive it, or does the pattern of fear perpetuate?"
" Oi!
",2017-11-04 00:00:00,2,"Wut was this mess? Heinlein's obscure short story just didn't translate to the screen. The Jane character wanting to be involved in space travel is never clearly developed. She tells the story to the barkeep, but why is he a barkeep? Jane meeting the barkeep could/should have been the first scene. A confusing mess. Really? No. Just no"
" worst movie ever
",2017-10-31 00:00:00,1,"This movie made zero sense. Intellectually, even for a person who likes science fiction movies such as Inception or Looper, this movie was terrible and badly executed. The start of the story was insanely long and boring. The paradox theory about time travel didn't make sense and was just downright confusing and stupid. Ethan Hawke's worst movie ever. I wish time travel was true so I could go back in time and not watch that movie."
" Surprised It Was As Good As It Was
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,7,"I like good Sci-Fi flicks. I've not been much of a reader in the category however so, I was unfamiliar with Heinlein, I get he's one of the father's of the genre to many. This means often he's considered along side some of his contemporaries who became known better (i.e household names) than he, that would Asimov and Clarke. That said what I was able to read about Heinlein seemed promising so I thought it's Ethan Hawke and mostly he's enjoyable to watch and when he's not it usually doesn't take longer than 10 in and I'm done. So, Predestination got the nod for a look-see.Predestination has theme of time travel and a sub-text of how it could relate to keeping catastrophic events that happened from ever doing so. Perhaps it has a whole other question of what a person would do given the chance to alter outcomes? I guess time travel will always be of fantastical interest as in ""what if?"". But, terrorism and serial killing in a story from 1958¬Öthat's impressive as now we are aware of a much different world. This would be shocking in the time it was written and sadly not so much when this film was made. Sometimes Sci-Fi incorporates things which seem far-fetched only to later become more relevant as if the writer saw the future. This quality is always impressive in retrospect. In as many ways the story has little relevance to the terrorism abatement as we know it (i.e. we can't travel back to alter time) but, it is somewhat amazing that in '58 that element was used, and in NYC as a key part of the story, which is definitely mind-bending. In the end it's pure entertainment and because it gets complicated with human emotions and smart slow reveals (as to who the travelers are) it holds your attention. The ending will be brilliant to some and frustrating to as many but, it's the ride in between that pulls the Sci-Fi fan in. In that regard it is quite an original and good flick."
" The best Time Travel movie
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,9,"If you like time travel paradoxes this is the movie for you. I have seen many movies about time travel but most of them follow the same pattern. This movie is different. Mostly because it's exploring a very unique time travel paradox. It's reminiscent of the ""Song of Storms"" time travel paradox from the Zelda video game franchise.All I can say is that this movie will blow your mind with it's paradox. It's so original and intellectually stimulating. At the end everything falls perfectly into place. Or does it?...p.s. I'm actually writing a sci-fi novel about time travel myself so I just watched the movie to get some ideas."
" Hard to understand why... this movie has a rating greater than 1
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,1,"Predestination is kind of like a good movie in reverse - it starts off interesting, with some breadcrumbs tossed about here and there, but the more you watch and find out, the stupider the movie gets, until the end, when you wish you had one of the guns that Ethan Hawke used in the movie, so you could shoot yourself.Never have I gotten to the end of a movie with more hope that I would not be as disappointed as I thought I was going to be, only to have that disappointment expanded by a factor of 10.If you are wanting to off yourself and are waiting for that final push, watch this movie, it will really make you wonder what you have been waiting for."
" Slow and Predictable
",2017-10-19 00:00:00,7,"The acting is good, but it starts out really slow, picks up a little but end the end it is predictable. Typical time travel paradoxes abound and you can see the ending coming after about the first 15 minutes. Worth a watch if you have nothing else to do or don't want to think too hard about what is going on."
" Excellent and Well Thought Out Sci-Fi
",2017-10-19 00:00:00,9,"I think Australia has supplanted the U.S. in the motion picture industry with actor talent and movie production. This is another example. Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook are exceptional in this film. The film itself is artfully directed, they story is intelligent and surprising. Dark at times yet wonderfully told story concerning temporal science. Yes, time travel but filled with twists and turns. Sarah Snook who I had no experience with was stunningly good in this role. Enough so that I checked for her other works. She is breathtakingly beautiful to say the least and extremely talented. In this film she plays several roles, both male and female. She does well in both.I don't get enthusiastic about much any more. A victim of my age and the society I find myself in here in the U.S. I strongly recommend this film to lovers of intelligent science fiction. No futuristic technology and weaponry but for the idea of time travel itself. A real gem in an industry that produces so few."
" Extremely mind blowing.
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,9,"There is no much words to describe how mind blowing the movie was. That the whole thing was a single person all along. The acting was really good, really emotional and realistic, even the unrealistic subject as time travel came on very realistic and serious. The script has surely got lots of effort. Its not easy for someone to understand that and make it into a movie. However, there is a reason that it didn't get 10/10 rating. The purpose. What was all of the purpose of doing that? I came on the conclusion that it should give life a meaning, but i am confused. Anyways, overall its a great movie and i highly recommend you to watch if you are over 17 at least."
" Best Heinlein adaptation to date
",2017-10-13 00:00:00,9,"Spoilers indicated only because you can't discuss this flick otherwise.First, it's important to know that this is a faithful rendition of a Heinlein story that was originally published in 1959, and that was a reworking of ideas first put forth in an earlier story, ""By His Bootstraps"", published in 1941. If the ideas seem stale, it is because Heinlein invented them that long ago. As an early libertarian who leaned toward fascism, Heinlein is inherently problematic, but was well educated, imaginative, and creative.That said, this might be the first (if flawed) presentation of transgenderism in popular fiction, in a reasonably respectful way, given the social mores of 1959. For that, Heinlein deserves credit, and this may be the most faithful film rendering of a Heinlein story delivered to date. For those bored by the long bar discussion in the first half -that is how it is told in the story, and there is no better way to present it.To further the paradox, it is a tale that is both dated and, apparently, still ahead of our time - given the top-notch rendition of an old story, it deserves at least 9/10."
" Came out of nowhere!
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,2,"One of the worst movies. They tried to make a twisted movie about time traveling but it seems that they lost themselves. Some points:New John can't remember the face of his/her old and the only love. Doesn't his own new look trigger something in his mind?He goes back with Barkeep to the time when Jane met that mysterious man. And he f*** himself/herself. Who does that? Barkeep didn't tell John that he needs to sleep with his own past (Jane). John does that with no reason. The only thing he knows is that sleeping with Jane (himself) will make her/his life miserable. He didn't know about the loop that moment. He just fell in love with herself.The loop or the baby came out of nowhere. There is a conversation between John and Robertson when John is going to snatch the baby. Robertson tells him that he's more than an agent, a gift given to the world through a predestination paradox. And we're supposed to accept it. No sign of logic. Writers didn't try to make it believable.Some conversations was deliberately scripted unusual so that we can't find out who is who. Not good.You don't need to watch this movie. Just read about predestination paradox."
" Wow. Mind bending.
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,7,All i can say is wow. I was totally enthralled by the movie. So many unexpected twists and turns and all done in a beautiful and exciting way. Totally unexpected. The end could be better explained but i don't expect much because of the paradox of the time travel is unexplainable.Watch and be taken for a mind boggling ride. Enjoy!

" The Most Brilliant Movie Ever
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,10,"This is the best film I've ever seen. I was completely hooked by this amazing plot. I couldn't stop to be thrilled through this film. In the beginning, it is a little bit hard to connect between scenes, but all of them are connected toward the unexpected ending. A man works at a bar, and another man comes to the bar and starts to talk his incredible past. When he begins to talk, he says to him, 'When I was a little girl.¬Ö¬Ö'. In that moment, I thought it must be interesting. His past story is beyond our imagination, and the development of the story is amazing. However, his past story is not the main story of this film but just the one step toward the incredible ending. Time traveling and sci-fi are connected cleverly and advance hints are dropped in some scenes, which are a bewildering and twisted structure. Meanwhile, I was moved and attracted by the performance of Sarah Snook who stars a man character and a woman one. When I understood the whole structure, my mind was blown away. After watching, I basked in the afterglow of this film. I can't find words to describe the greatness of this film."
" Found the Rooster
",2017-07-03 00:00:00,10,"I read the reviews and a number of people still don't get over the fact that this paradox doesn't make sense at all (which came first, the chicken or the egg?) and need something more to keep it going. Well, apparently the makers of the film have inserted the necessary references in 0:28, 0:33, 0:51, 1:09, 1:18 also.The ""rooster"" can be thought of as Mr Robertson who obviously orchestrated the entire chain of which-came-first problem, who needed someone outside the system, outside the bureaucracy which would never agree to the idea of Fizzle Bomber, but yet badly needed to solve so many problems.He created the chain of events that led to the creation of the chicken-egg that is, probably making illegal jumps over a short period of his own time (which is why he looks the same throughout the movie) starting with his discovery of the unique talent that he turned into Mr Fizzle (eventually), in 0:28."
" A totally MIND BENDING movie
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,8,"after watching the movie this was moving in my mind that John is Jane and Jane is the bartender, and the bartender is John, and the daughter of John and Jane is John and Jane and bartender. The bartender is the temporal agent and John is bartender which means Jane and John and the bartender and the daughter of Jane and John and bartender is Jane and John and bartender and a temporal agent. Now, Jane is a writer with a pen name The unmarried mother and Jane is John and bartender and her own daughter that means the John and the bartender and the daughter of Jane and John and temporal agent is unmarried mother. Now the fizzle bomber is none other than the bartender which means that fizzle bomber is Jane and John and the bartender and the daughter of Jane and John and bartender. The bartender kill the fizzle bomber i.e Jane and John and the bartender and the daughter of Jane and John and bartender kills Jane and John and the bartender and the daughter of Jane and John and bartender. And, John marry Jane which again means Jane and John and the bartender and the daughter of Jane and John and bartender is married Jane and John and the bartender and the daughter of Jane and John and bartender. Then the bartender takes the baby to the orphanage which means Jane and John and the bartender and the daughter of Jane and John and bartender takes Jane and John and the bartender and the daughter of Jane and John and bartender to the orphanage. And all the time Jane and John and the bartender and the daughter of Jane and John and bartender telling her story to herself."
" an audacious adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's short story where solipsism and inevitability has been emblazoned to the fore
",2017-06-22 00:00:00,7,"Aussie directors-duo the Spierig Brothers' third feature is an audacious adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's short story ALL YOU ZOMBIES, where solipsism and inevitability has been emblazoned to the fore with a little help of the time travel gimmick, but the original text is obviously inadequate to qualify as a feature-length material, the brothers must beef up their script thence they introduce the character of the mysterious ""Fizzle Bomber"", a consequential decision both burnishes and undermines the film's appeal. Envelope has been furthermore pushed in a way that now Heinlein's solipsistic concept finally reaches its ultimate crest where a person (please suspending your disbelief!) can literally be conceived and terminated all by himself/herself, everything is able to be pre-designed as long as the said person is set to meet different versions of himself/herself in the right time, which makes the contrivances of hermaphrodite and facial disfigurement utilitarian methods to obfuscate audience's apprehension, and it does work if one does have entrenched faith in the soi-disant ""predestination paradox"", to quote Wikipedia, here is its definition ""a time loop in which a time traveler who has gone into the past causes an event that ultimately causes the original future version of the person to go back into the past"".On the other hand, the Fizzle Bomber appendage inevitably takes the shine off the otherwise unified theory by press-ganging a stiff character transformation which isn't as persuasive as the rest theory (however cockamamie it is!), Jane, John, the time-traveling agent, are the same person in different phases, we can buy that (which is Heinlein's whimsical idea), but why he also must be the Fizzle Bomber? If inevitability is the overriding proviso, the audience probably might feel discombobulated to suss what damage has the bomber done? Has the hyped terrorist crime in 1975 been pre-empted or is it as inevitable as the narcissistic chance meeting of falling in love with oneself in a previous time-line (albeit foreknowing all the consequences)? That is what bugging me the most upon a first viewing. Whereas a fascinating story is at its core, the film itself is less flashy and without much flourish, lackluster flashback and barroom t√™te-√†-t√™te fill up most of the time, the meager action scenes are slipshod and the sole explosion set piece is atrociously cheap-looking. In the acting realm, Ethan Hawke is habitually on automatic pilot, giving the ex-positional guidance in earnest and maintains a necessary patina of engagement, but the linchpin here is the lesser-known Australian actress Sarah Snook, takes the dualistic role in her stride and proves to be pleasantly chameleon-like in juggling both sexes, adding much ballast to an utter tall-tale, totally beyond one's wildest imagination."
" A brilliant time travel tale
",2017-06-15 00:00:00,10,"A bartender starts a conversation with an unusual client which leads to a storytelling about life, time travel and the paradoxes of it.It's a pretty unusual movie who's entire plot is based on time travel. Although very slow paced, we follow the life of the bar client which he promises to be one of a kind. The plot is very interesting at its core, especially when they move to the time travel part, while your mind begins to struggle with the contradictory information it receives due to the paradoxes which are implied. They've managed to take a fantastic but brilliant idea and transform it into something which simply makes your brain hurt.If you're after a mind boggling story like I was, this is the movie to see. I cannot express it in words so I will deeply encourage you to see it! It really is a masterpiece in terms of plot."
" No Logic, but intriguing!!!
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,8,"I have to confess that l'd needed a twice of look to try to understand the plot and the proposal of this intriguing picture, starting in the middle of the story and going back, next to the future, this Australian sci-fi hold you and challenging you every time, the story is complex and contradictory, a different look of a time travel, Ethan Hawn whom is a fine actor is superb in this role, apart him and Noah Taylor the casting is practically unknown for us, intriguing and compelling movie that deserves a second chance who didn't like it!!!Resume:First Watch: 2017 / How many: 1 / Source: Netflix / Rating: 8"
" Unique Science Fiction Heartbreaker
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,9,"Sarah Snook turned in a brilliant performance, as did Ethan Hawke. It was probably Ethan's best effort yet - or maybe it was the role that suited him so well. For the story to work, the agent had to be an unsuspecting, down to Earth, humanized person and Hawke was perfect for it.Jane (Snook) won me over. I fell in love with her. Then she broke my heart. And then broke my heart again when she was forced to part with herself, thus break her own heart as well.I don't like to know anything about a movie before I plug it in. Nothing. I avoid all trailers and reviews, etc. I purchased it with the assumption and hope that it was a movie relating to the Christian doctrine of predestination.What I got instead was one of the best written, produced, and acted sci-fi dramas I've ever seen--one that had absolutely nothing to do with my expectations and in fact exceeded them immensely.I'm not really a movie buff. I am extremely picky and almost always walk away disappointed. What I look for is a movie that went under the radar, wasn't over-hyped, and doesn't contain immersion-preventing flaws. Well. This movie fit the bill and THEN some. I've seen it 3 times and I'll see it again."
" Interesting and confusing which makes it worth the watch
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,6,"Real-life link: you need a purpose in life. Plausibility: this is not the aim of the movie so it should not be too much of a concern. The whole idea of time travel is implausible at the moment. However, in terms of plausibility of action and reactions to those actions, the movie does quite well. People can do whatever it takes to give themselves a purpose. Again, it all comes down to emotions. Storytelling: very good storytelling method. Moves very fast and reveals the events in a very interesting way that keeps you wondering and wanting to know more. Character development: There is one main character that comes during different stages of his/ her life. You understand the reasons behind all her/his actions and that makes the character deep and understood. Casting: Great leads and great acting. Very fit for the role. Overall, it is interesting and confusing which makes it worth the watch."
" Thinking man's - okay, person's - sci-fi thrills
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,6,"PREDESTINATION is a thinking person's science fiction thriller that has more intelligence than a rival Hollywood effort like LOOPER. This talky Australian drama features strong performances from the two leads, Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook, and well it might as the entire delivery of the plot rests on their shoulders.It's a slow-burner at first, starting off well but then descending into an endless life story that seems to have little to do with anything. Stick with it, though, because it does all have a reason, and once the pieces of this crazy jigsaw start fitting together, it all comes together for a rather satisfying resolution. I wouldn't call it a perfect film - it's too low budget for that - but it does feel fresh and inventive, and you won't guess the outcome."
" Not The Best Time Travel Movie, Though One Of The Better Acted And Told.
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,8,"This is a very well sculptured and acted time travelling tale about an agent who is on his final mission to stop the fizzle bomber. Throughout all his travels back in time, the bomber has always appeared to be one step ahead of him.The Spierig Brothers, Michael and Peter, wrote a nicely crafted and layered story based on the Robert A Heinlein's story ""All you zombies"". As directors, they do a fantastic job of bringing the story to the screen and getting the best out of their actors. I've always rated Ethan Hawke and here he excels as The Barkeep; the agent on his last assignment. Along with Sarah Snook, who is brilliant as The Unmarried Mother, they add a touch of class to the movie.This is not an action-packed movie as it relies on the story rather than glossy special effects and fight scenes. At times, it's slow and thought-provoking as the audience is slowly immersed in an emerging mystery. The climax makes Oldboy's seem tame in comparison.There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film...Except for one thing...From H G Wells' The Time Machine to Doctor Who to Back To The Future to Dr Who there's been one absolute that a time traveller must not do... but they always do... The paradox. Unfortunately, if you like science fiction and time travel then you will probably figure out the ending of the film before it comes. I had an inkling in the first scene. Then, by the twentieth minute, I'd got most of it figured out. Ten minutes after that I understood. Which left two-thirds of the film left to go.However, this wasn't much of an issue as the film pretty much carries itself strongly throughout and I enjoyed every minute of it, right up to the chilling finale.This is not a film for everybody, though if you don't mind the slower dramatic style of movie-making then you should enjoy this film."
" mind bender,may contain spoilers
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,7,"First of all if you are easily confused then put the film back on the shelf,the first hour kept my attention and really enjoyed it ( not really a big sci fi person), sarah snook is superb ,and the story is intriguing enough to keep you interested.the film then moves on down the old time traveller road and gets you thinking here we go again!but not so ,its got a bit of a twist from the norm and kept me glued to the screen till the end.sadly after the film it will drive you nuts trying to make sense of it in you're head.frustrating !yes without a doubt and i have read some in depth conversations on the film,all different.but then when i racked my brains a bit more i decided yes this film is good ,good enough to make you think about it for days after.also im afraid there are holes in the plot ,i questioned if they were in a contast loop in time how come nobody recognises anybody else when they see them ,truth is its a paradox ,its illogical ,doesnt seem possible ,and leads you to many conclusions but never an answer because there isn't one . A paradox ,unbelievable ,illogical ,dont read into it to much because there is no logical answer ,just enjoy,i did."
" Terrific (may be the best) time travel movie!
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,9,"What would be a perfect time travel movie? The situation where past present and future are compactly arranged in such a way subjects know everything and the things stay as the way they are.What I liked most in this movie is Jane and John are same characters and that one of them is baby of other. I mean the same person is man, woman, and their child. It's simply awesome.The only thing that I found was a goof is Ethan and Sarah doesn't share same height and may be even the physique."
" Excellent time travel paradox story, that keeps you pondering
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,7,"Predestination opens with a man trying to disarm a bomb, which fails because the bomber is still there and he disables him. He does however successfully contain the bomb explosion but his face gets burned off. Shortly after these events we learn that this man is an agent for a mysterious organization that solves crime by catching the criminals before the deeds are happening, using time travel. After his face got burned, he returned to his own time and is given a new face using plastic surgery. He is then given his last assignment for the organization: catch the infamous ""Fizzle Bomber"". For this he has to go to 1978 New York and work as a bartender, which goes well until a particular customer shows up who starts sharing his life story with the bartender. This extraordinary life story starts a chain of events that gets weirder and more complex the longer it goes on.I have seen several time travel movies at this point but this is the first one that blew my mind on several occasions. The paradox created in this one is very well done and leaves you pondering for several days. Off course I cannot say anything about it or the movie would be spoiled, so you have to see for yourself. The strongest part of the movie for me was the part where the barkeeper (Ethan Hawke) meets John who tells his life story. There was really strong chemistry between the two actors in this scene and they made good use of showing well detailed flashbacks. Some reviewers complained that the movie should have opened with this scene and I agree with them. It took a while for me to adjust from the world building / exciting opening scene to two people who share a story over some drinks. It all comes together in the third act of the film but I think the movie improved if they managed to do all the world building after the bar scene. But otherwise this movie looks and sounds great. The time travel special effects are done very well and look realistic to me. And unlike some other time travel paradox movies, this one is full closure: you should know and understand everything when the credits roll. So definitely check this out if you like time travel movies or just want to watch a movie and go ""WTF?"" a few times."
" Totally predictable
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,6,"I had great expectations about this film because I love science-fiction and time traveler movies, and also because of the high ratings on IMDb.Predestination has a great atmosphere, great lighting, and a good production. The acting is decent on all parts, but Sarah Snook shows her versatility as actress playing different roles and different life stages with conviction.The movie has a good central idea with interesting ethical embedded questions that some people might find daring (that is my case) and other people might find appalling or even shocking. Also, there is an ambiguity in the film that, at least in my case, kept me wondering whether all was happening in reality, was just a sort of hallucination or perhaps half-half.Unfortunately, neither the ethical questions nor the ambiguity are explored to the fullest and, the worst thing is that the script is predictable is you are an usual science-fiction watcher, even if you aren't, so not especially exciting. Don't take me wrong, this is an enjoyable film to watch, but right in the middle regarding everything except for Snook's brilliant performance."
" Very obvious plot, lack of an interesting story
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,1,"I got recommended to watch this as I like plot twists, but I got hugely disappointed. At min 40 the entire plot was already obvious. You don't have to be a time-travel movie expert to figure it out and the characters/story isn't that interesting. I guess what they do wrong is that there are no side-stories that can suddenly catch you off-guard.Only spend time on this movie if you really really like anything with time travel and don't care for an interesting plot(twist). But then first watch any other time travel movie that you can find on IMDb."
" Time well spent!
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,8,"I just by chance came across this movie, and because it was only just over an hour & a half, I thought why not -- What a nice surprise! This film is gripping from the start, the acting is amazing and the story telling Is great. It will take you on a journey of wonderment, full of twists, turns and just when you think you've got it and guessed it all, you're wrong. I whole heartily believe this is one of those films that has been severely over looked, an absolute gem & people should be watching this, it's a refreshing change of pace from the usual stuff you'll see."
" Poor movie
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,2,It made me vomit . The movie is based on a strange plot with poor actors. I felt the concept of the movie is peculiar and it sucks . I don't know how it got so much appreciation . It wasted my time . My advice is don't watch it . I was feeling very sleepy when I started to watch it . The movie wanted to make twist . But it made the movie worse than before.
" Must watch
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,9,"This was amazing. Really well made, great thought put into the story. Mind-twisting and probably one of my top movies. I've probably watched it about 10 times, showing all my friends. REALLY REALLY GOOD STORY. Who ever wrote this needs to make more movies. Honestly worth the watch!"

" Absolutely brilliant and intelligent movie.Very underrated.
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,10,"This is not just classic sci-fi it is almost a classic Greek play: Fateful and tragic. That's the parting feeling. But it delivers so many genres on any level you care to enjoy it. To me the strength of this film is the characters‚Äîevery day people like ourselves‚Äîseeing themselves in an extraordinary light. As time-travel stories go there are none of the paradoxes of other such films to frustrate you. The elegant, thought-provoking symmetry of the original short story is respected beautifully‚Äîbut hats off to the directors for expanding it into a study of human self-identity. In my opinion the best sci-fi only uses fantasy (within the realms of possibility) to explore humanity in ways that a grounding in known reality cannot, and this film offers viewers a 'what if' so believably presented they can put themselves in that situation and question themselves in a way they normally never would. The only paradox here is the very real inescapable self of all of us and yet being so many different people throughout our lives. You will benefit from seeing this film."
" You are not alone in your head
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,8,"It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.First of all the movie shows that the human being is extremely complicated.There are a lot of persons in one head.They can fight one with another,they can have long talks inside the head.The individual can be proud of some of them or be ashamed.To fall in love,to hate,to give birth to a baby and to kill--and all these things happen inside one and the same body and directed to one and the same human being is tough.The movie is my favorite because it is a mixture of a nightmare,a common life story,scientific fiction and fine psychology digging in the depth of human brain.And I adore the actors.Their job was not simple but they managed to make you believe,and they touched your soul."
" Mind blowing time travel film
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,9,"This is one of the best films i hv ever seen. Amazing acting skills and amazing story line. A definite mention abt the direction which is just fabulous . The film is going to create a lot of confusion throughout but after the ending, its seriously going to blow your mind.. U r going to think about it for weeks.. Must recommended film.. If you are a fan of sci fic and thriller, this film is just for you. This film should gt an Oscar. I have ranked 9 out of 10, Which is pretty high, cuz normally I dnt give this high rank to any film. PREDESTINATION is a must watch film...You are going to end up loving this film. And even if you dnt love sci fic genre, then also you r going to like it. Thrilling, entertaining and beautiful film. This is definitely one of my favorite's."
" Henlein. That is all.
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,8,"As a fan of Heinlein, this movie (based on his work All You Zombies)was a fun ride. This review will contain no spoilers. I do warn you though to go into this film without the need to understand EVERYTHING. There might be a few things that just do not make sense to you. That is OK, considering a movie that is based on time travel is apt to do. I pride myself on seeing plot twists prior to the actual event. This movie was able to perform a ""magic trick"" by keeping your attention over to one side while preparing a different surprise on the the other. Well done. Time travel movies always have a paradox in them. Instead of trying to seep that paradox under the rug or trying to explain it, Predestination uses it as it's main plot line. I found myself trying to relate the story to some friends and found the task highly difficult. Hawke was solid in his role and Snook was a pleasant surprise. Highly recommended."
