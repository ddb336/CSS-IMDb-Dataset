",2021-04-10 00:00:00,10,I really liked this movie. Giggled a lot! Thank you for the recommendation.
" Rapid-fire comedy
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,7,"The best description I've heard of this film is that it's like a rapid chain of comedy sketches. It is very rapidly paced with a variety of set pieces and unpredictable comedic moments that give it a sense of dynamism. Despite that style, it is still united by a coherent (if simple) plotline and memorable characters. We have the reluctant hero, the klutz, the bullying boss, the oddballs, the neglected boy and more. The premise is equally memorable - set in a (literal) baby factory turned into an Amazon pastiche, a stork seeking a promotion must partner with an orphan to deliver a ninja boy to a young boy who is seeking companionship. While being chased by (what seems to be) an insane stork who tried to become a parent and a pack of shapeshifting wolves. I must say, the creativity and unpredictability of this film makes it a joy to watch, even if not all of the moments work well (the pigeon's songs were annoying and unnecessary) and even if the story lacks sophistication."
" Best movie but why don't dubbed in hindi?
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,9,"One of the best movie i ever seen.It's very funny.Only one thing is missing. My language
Why don't dubbed in hindi?"
" had some good moments
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,5,Some good humor but overall not that much to write home about. Very formulaic film thats just goes through a standard checklist of kids movies. All in all this peaks in mediocrity.5/10: uhh.
" Way underrated
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,9,Great movie to watch with the kids they love it and the adults do to.
" I love it...
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,8,"As bad as the animation is, if you have a cute baby, cutes animal and charismatic and disturbing humans, it's over, my heart wins, everything very cute and delicate, simple and captivating, I love it... kind of tiring, with the chases, but that cute, hopeful and beautiful ending..."
" Good animation movie...
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,5,"""Storks"" is an Animation - Adventure movie in which we watch storks changing from delivering babies to packages for a famous company. When one delivery stork accidentally activates the Baby Making Machine and one baby girl needs to find her home, he has to do everything he can in order to deliver the baby and fix his mistake.I enjoyed watching this movie because it had many funny moments, it was interesting and the voices that were used fitted very well in the characters of the movie. The direction which was made by Nicholas Stoller and Doug Sweetland, it was very good and I believe they both did an excellent job because they succeeded on making us understand and follow the story without losing our interest. Lastly, I have to say that ""Storks"" is a nice animation movie that I recommend it to everyone because I am sure you will have a great time watching it."
" Not for me...
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,4,"The age old tale of storks delivering babies comes to life in 'Storks'.Since I generally love animated movies, I honestly tried to like this. Alas, I just couldn't get into it. Nothing here felt original. It was almost as if they were trying too hard. As if they took elements from other successful animated movies, blended it in a mixer and added some spice here and there. It was all too reminiscent of the first 'Ice Age', and the character Tulip sounded and acted a lot like Joy from 'Inside Out'.Much of the humor was cartoonish and downright silly, and would appeal more to a very young demographic. The comic relief character Pigeon Toady was pretty much a 'been there done that' character, and far more annoying than funny. The wolves were also more fit for a television cartoon than a feature film.The film tries so hard to toy with your emotions, but never succeeds. From an adventure perspective it was exciting, but apart from that nothing here grabbed me. I found my attention constantly wandering. I know this was probably meant to be cute and all, but no matter how hard I tried, I just didn't find it all that interesting. One thing's for certain: parents are going to have a lot of explaining to do when youngsters start asking questions..."
" Well, this was unexpected.
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,6,"Huh... this was actually pretty good. How about that?The characters are likable.
The voice acting was good.
Every actor fit their role really well.
The slapstick humor was funny.
The whole wolf scene was hilarious.
It's bright and colorful.
The animation is really good, too!It's a surprisingly funny movie that I wouldn't mind seeing again."
" Unethical hilarious fun, underrated
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,9,"A blast of comedy, entertainment and great story! Andy Samburg is so funny in this which is uplifting always. I originally saw in the theater even then I remember laughing so hard and felt enlightened! Glad it comes on HBO family sometimes, I'd recommend to anyone a fan of animated easy to watch films especially that don't require much brain power."
" Hilarious and adorable
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,7,"It has nonstop laughs, adorable baby faces and a touch of heartwarming family bonds. The plot is also unique, which makes it interesting enough. I did not expect this. A more than should-watch if you love babies or just want a funny movie that ALWAYS DELIVERS 😂 (you'll get what i mean by watching it)"
" Quite possibly the funniest animation I've ever seen
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,9,"I'm not ashamed to say as a full grown man that this movie had me rolling on my couch with laughter. Highly enjoyable and a hidden gem. One of those where you come across it on TV and give it a shot...and it blows you away. Give it a shot , it's worth it"
" A great and fresh film for families
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,8,"I was pleasantly surprised to watch Storks. By means of fun puns, dynamite rhythm, and soulful characters, the film creates an awesome adventure for our kids and us to watch!"
" Wonderful
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,9,"It's got everything I'd want from an animated feature and even more. Super sweet, beautifully animated, funny, quite smart and even unpredictable at times. I don't understand why the IMDb rating is so low - it's far from average, and it's got heart. Beautiful work, animators !"
" A little all over the place and largely nonsensical, but 'Storks' is suitably enjoyable
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,7,"A little all over the place and largely nonsensical, but 'Storks' is suitably enjoyable; especially, I imagine, for the younger audience.It's not as heartfelt as it intends to be, bar the odd moment at the end, but there are a couple of amusing gags here and there. The animation is pretty nice, too.Cast-wise it's passable, Andy Samberg (Junior) and Katie Crown (Tulip) work together solidly, as Kelsey Grammer makes for a decent enough villain. Keegan-Michael Key (Alpha) and Jordan Peele (Beta) aren't as funny as I've seen from the duo elsewhere, while Jennifer Aniston (Sarah) is underused.Nevertheless, a satisfactory animated film from Warner Bros."
" A rare gem💎💎
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,9,Amazing and funny characters. Nice soundtrack. Pigeon toady is my favorite. I have watched for more than 20 times and it never bores me!!
" Take your birth control and snuggle up to this.
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,7,"Even I can see so much wrong with this logistically. For example, if Tulip has this Genius level intellect where she can both design AND make these contraptions then how can she be a burden on them? It's an entirely informed attribute that she is ditzy and if they squander her evident talent then that's really on them.But if you look beyond the technicalities there is much to like in this odd-couple buddy road trip comedy that has a little too much faith in its own capacity to make a human infant seem like the most desirable thing ever. Nevertheless the charactization is firm, the script is slick and the emotional and intriguing elements of the plot are indeed engaging as a lonely bird who uses work to replace interpersonal relationships learns something from the sexy girl.From when I first saw the poster I thought I might watch this just for her. She that unusually combination of sexy and cute. I literally just now added ""cyuxty"" to urban dictionary to describe such a phenomenon, isn't that kooky? It's nice to see characters like Tulip in media; women that actually have personality without having to be all SERIOUS! while still sort of intelligent. What it reminds us is that just because you have the smarts to do certain smart things, doesn't mean that you aren't liable to make bad decisions.With a rich heap of voice acting talent (especially Kelsey Grammar as a viscous corporate villain), you could do worse than this perfectly reasonable of efforts."
" Why this doesn't have a higher rating?
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,10,"I wasn't expecting much when I pressed play, but I laughed so hard so many times!! Andy Samberg steals the show and I'm here for it. I'm 23 years old and this movie is definitely one of my animated favorites."
" Great animation
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,8,"Storks is a great animation that's ridiculous, colourful and heartwarming despite it's confusing premise. Andy Samberg and Katie Crown are both great. Steve Glickman and Kelsey Grammer are really good. It's well paced, consistently funny and the direction by Nicholas Stoller and Doug Sweetland is great. The animation is fantastic and the music by Jeff Danna and Mychael Danna is good."
" Better than citizen Kane
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,10,"If you don't like this movie, you belong in a camp, as your genetic line is of no further use to humanity."
" Sweet, fun movie
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,9,"🎬
It's a great movie. Lots of cute moments, many laughs."
" Harmless Fun
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,6,"Andy Samberg is fun as his normal Brooklyn 99-ish character. The stand-our was Frasier as the head stork but everything else was pretty generic. I love Key and Peele's but which was fun, but the movie lacks originality or a more emotional plot to really connect you with the jokes and the emotion of the scenes."
" ""Storks"" Delivered
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,8,"I turned this movie on for two reasons:1.) Something for the kids to watch2.) Something for the kids to watch that I could actually enjoy.When it came on, I thought, ""Here we go again. Just another of the same animation."" It began with the main stork, Junior (Andy Samberg), narrating about the good ol' days of storks delivering babies and how the storks had to adapt so they converted to a package delivery company named CornerStore.com. Junior flew into the big warehouse in the sky and he's saying what's up to everyone and you can tell that life is grand. It was your very typical animation beginning.Then something peculiar happened: the movie got good. And funny. I did not expect that at all. Tulip (Katie Crown), the only human in an all-Stork business, had a baby to deliver and Junior was going to help her out of self-preservation. This led them on a journey that was quite entertaining.I immediately recognized the voice of Kegan-Michael Key as the Alpha Wolf, which was a big plus (the wolf pack in general was hilarious). I did not know that Jordan Peele was the Beta Wolf until the end credits. I thought those guys hadn't combined on an animation until ""Toy Story 4."" Oh well, lucky me.In the end I was pleasantly surprised. ""Storks"" delivered."
" One our favorites
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,8,"Most underrated kids movie. We love watching this over and over, the banter is great and so many great characters pigeon toady and wolf pack 😍"
" A great animation
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,9,A great animation. Greats characters. Great history
" wonderful animation
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,10,This film is very beautiful. the characters is very carismatic
" FAMILY FUN AT ITS FINEST
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,10,"This film had me crying with laughter. Heartwarming storyline... Outstanding voice acting from Andy and Katie. But it's Andy Samberg so no surprises there! Highly recommended to anyone who wants a good laugh after a stressful day!! Kudos
What makes me sad though is that such brilliance these days is usually a onesey"
" Underrated!
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,9,"This film is Ìncredible. I can't count the amount of times I've watched it. It is most certainly the funniest ""kids"" film I've ever watched. I'm not sure why it has such a low review, it should be up there with Zootopia or Inside."
" Storks
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,1,The intelligence level of the movie is unbelievable. You could tell me the film was made by storks and I would believe you.
" Very underrated
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,10,I love this movie. That's all I can say. Just go watch it yourself. It will put a 🙃 on your face
" HYSTERICAL & GUT-BUSTING! One of the funniest animated flicks of all time!!
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,10,"This movie is a criminally underrated gem. I watch almost every animated movie released, and 'Storks' ranks with the best of the best. There are no deep messages or aphorisms here - it's simply chock full of gut-busting humor from beginning to end. Although it's absolutely a kid-friendly flick, much of the humor is aimed at adults. And unlike almost all animated movies it doesn't use a lot of cheap-shot pop culture references or fart jokes to get those laughs. If you're a fan of Andy Samberg, you're gonna love it, but knowing his schtick is certainly not required. The animation and writing are terrific and the rapid-fire jokes come at a frenetic mile a minute pace. It had me cracking up throughout and I'm a tough audience. I'll have to watch it again to catch all the jokes I missed. Check out 'Storks', you'll be glad you did."
" Seriously underrated movie
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,10,Just watch it! It's somehow made it to one of my favorite animations despite hown random it is. Just check it out and make sure you especially wait until you see the wolves 😂
" Really funny
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,10,"Best part, when He Jennifer Aniston's character is debating on taking a call or helping her husband and son.....she hangs up on the call...the call is from A Jolly..... hilarious. I'm guessing a little dig at Angelina Jolie"
" The proof of the importance of the last sequence
",2019-08-27 00:00:00,7,"I was gonna give the movie a 6. The premise is really interesting, and I think it was executed properly. The comedy is great, absurd, self-conscious and fun. However, the pace turned too slow during the first half of the second act, specially when they get strained in the ice place. It was also a little cliche to have the characters getting stuck in their way to achieve their goal. Happens in Monsters Inc, Ice Age, Finding Nemo... The climax is weak. There is never really a showdown between the heroes and Hunter, where after an intense battle, the antagonist almost wins. Even after all that, I gave the movie a 7, all because of the last sequence. The montage where the storks go back to deliver babies was powerful. And then, Junior has to say goodbye to the baby that's been with him (and Tulip) for the whole journey. And he touched her, their goodbye, and sees her whole life go through. I can't tell why, but it resonated with me and took me to the verge of tears. Then, Tulip finds her family and they meet. That was powerful too. And that gave the movie a whole point up for me."
" Perfect family film
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,10,"Gorgeous animation, hilarity that is still funny after several viewings, and a premise that is thoroughly enjoyable.
This movie is so underrated and it's a shame. Between it's over the top farce bits and delicately sentimental moments you have yourself a beautiful movie."
" Underrated by far
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,10,I love this movie just happened to come across it by chance and ended up loving it! My 3 year old loves it and she also thinks it's funny. My husband and I laughed so much...we all quote it randomly and laugh. I can't believe ther reading isn't higher. So much better than some of the Disney movies I've seen that have gotten better reviews and shouldn't have. Seriously the comedy and sweet storyline are solid.
" Heart Warming & Hilarious
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,10,"Laughed a lot, lots of funny characters and moments. Ideal family viewing and heart warming story. Now one of my fav animated movies."
" Storks.
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,7,"Storks no longer deliver babies, so they now deliver packages for a market called corner store, junior (Andy samburg) is about to become boss but all he has to do is fire a girl, but when a baby is accidently created junior and the girl must deliver it and it gets difficult.
OK this movie is good on animation and characters and story, but the dialogue can be rubbish for example later on in the movie someone says ""what was that, it sounded like a baby, that's very suspicious."" (Worst line ever)."
" Don't listen to the haters
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie was fantastic! From beginning to end we laughed hysterically. Love that they used Andy Samberg and kept his humor. Cool cool
Cool! The actress who played Tulip was wonderful, she definitely kept up with Andy. The pigeon was OUTSTANDING!!! We will be quoting this movie for a while. And will be buying it. And the babies are too cute for words. I even swept away a few tears at times. Totally underrated."
" Highly underrated family comedy!
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,9,"I went and saw this with my daughter because she wanted to see a movie and there was ""nothing else to see."" Man, did I go in unawares. This movie is hilarious. As far as laughter goes, this is the funniest animated movie I have seen in a while. I laughed so much. Now, probably due to the fact that much of the humor is right in my wheelhouse and plays to my current stage of life (newborn and a young daughter), but even if you don't have young kids (Which you likely do if you're watching this), this movie is guaranteed to provide quite a few belly laughs."
" the worst movie of warner animation
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,3,The plot is slow and annoying the characters are unbearable and their message was already seen in other movies but worse uncomfortable rather than endearing
" The movie Free Birds could've been
",2019-04-29 00:00:00,10,"To start off with the overall design, as with any Soy Pictures Imageworksis different than any other on film currently and is artful in it's use of cartoonish movments to display a gentle spirit of innocence. Really, innocence is the best way to describe the film's world since it embodies, like Horton Hears a Who before it a sense of childhood wonder through each character's actions. No one character is inherently bad, and though flawed learn from their mistake on their own instead of being told directly by some stern authority figure. As the series goes on the plots and humor get more wacky and weird like all of Imagework's previous work, but in this case it is undercut by more melancholy and gentler moments of sweetness that make even the more ridiculous moments and characters seem more meaningful. I am still a big fan of Sony Pictures ANimation's fast paced surrealist humor but I think Storks surpasses it even in it's more funnier moments and definitely in it's more gentler moments."
" Middle of the road
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,5,I really like Andy samburg and he is a saving grace in this film. For me it wasn't the best animated film of recent times
" Okay storyline - hilarious jokes
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,8,The storyline is a little bland but the execution of comedy is very well done! The voice acting is great too. The one liners and characters are hilarious.
" A funny and beautiful movie. It's made for everyone
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,10,"This is the best computer animated movie, hands down!
It contains everything you could hope for and a little bit more. Quick punchlines and perfect expressions on the animated characters.
You laugh, you cry, you just love it!"
" Ideal watch to wind the family down
",2019-02-02 00:00:00,5,"Decided to watch the film and enjoy some time together with the family.There were enough laugh out loud moments to keep us all entertained, most of which seem to come from the additional characters. Fun enough to watch all the way through, and leave the youngster nicely unwinded in time for bed. bonus."
" Just watched and wow!
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,9,"Incredible choice of cast, amazing characters and that spontaneously belly laugh comedy that a lot more successful comedy films lack!
I even got feels from this film, man. It struck my heart-strings and I will be watching again, which is a rarity for me to do with most films I like."
" Sweet with a good sense of humour.
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,7,"Warner Bros. took a well known legend about storks delivering babies a made a hilarious cartoon out of it.Even though it doesn't hit all notes perfectly you're up for some of the most insane bursts of sight gags and fast-paced word juggling in this movie. It can get a little hectic here and there, but it mostly hits its mark.The story itself is nothing new, deliver something from a to b. But the execution of it is what makes it interesting, because of the obstacles the two main characters meet on the journey.The animation is on the cartoony side with exaggerated facial expressions and slap-stick humour which is funny when executed right. In this case it's mostly so, because a certain character is almost solely placed in the movie to be over-the-top, but gets old really quick (you'll spot him, trust me). But the character animation is well done and makes the humour work.But the central emotions are there too. It's not only fun and gags and the quiet moments and the ending show what heartfelt themes Storks is really about."
" Definitely underrated
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,9,"Love it and don't know why it got so underrated.
The characters are all lovable as well as the plots. Overall, i think it's much better than Baby Boss."
" Wasn't as annoying as I thought it was going to be
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,6,"I didn't find Storks as annoying as I thought I would. Andy Samberg does a good job playing Andy Samberg and the movie has some funny jokes and clever moments. This isn't an animated classic, but it's enjoyable enough to watch."
" Low rent idea
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,5,Worst animated female lead character of all time. Same old same old barely warmed up in this industrial film. Only vaguely funny thing is the recurring 'Wolf pack form of ...' gag. This one couldn't hold anyone's attention.
" Better than expected
",2018-12-12 00:00:00,8,"I didn't think much of the movie when I started it.. I didn't know the movie and it didn't have great reviews on IMDb. However, I really enjoyed the movie. (Maybe because of the low expectations though)
But the story is enjoyable and I found myself laughing out loud quite a few times during the movie. It is a light and fun movie to watch!It does not compare to some other Disney/Pixar movies but Storks is worth watching!"
" A flick for everyone
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,9,"A fast-paced action ride with loads of heart. The animation was snappy and the voices spot on. Kids will love the look, adults the jokes. A great surprise!
77%"
" Eye Popping Animation No Longer Such a Selling Point?
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,8,"I love animation! This film is no exception. Yet there is a massive glut of computer animated films these days, so that even films like The Secret Life of Pets, The Good Dinosaur, and Finding Dory can get lost in the sheer saturation of the genre. With a film like G Force, you can see how a story can wind up being forgettable even with striking animation. Despite it being very colorful with great characters, story, and eye-popping animation, Storks actually winds up being just cute. I mean, how many times have we now seen stupendous animation just like this? Still, it is something I'd definitely recommend, especially for animation freaks."
" Loved it
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,10,"Everytime I rewatch this I cant stop laughing. I changed my 9 to a 10 because of this. Its just so absurdly FUNNY. The sharp.slaptick wacky humor.grabs me and replaces whatever flaws there are (most likely there are many but I was laughing too much to care), and usually I nitpick and hate movies easily but this one grabbed me."
" Prochoice propeganda diskised as a cartoon.
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,5,"All the elements are there to make this cartoon movie a prochoice propaganda movie.
The villains portrait as the eagle, government, pidgeon scientist nerd, which are trying hard to not get the baby delivered.
The surrogate mother, etc..."
" One of the funniest and sweetest non Disney animation out there...
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,10,"This movie is amazing... not because of the storyline or animation, but because of the characters and script! Although known for delivering babies, the current boss of the stalk delivery centre diversified the business into a package delivery since there are ""so many other ways to make babies"".Junior, a fellow delivery stalk who is destined to take over the branch is forced to fire a young orphan human named Violet who was supposed to be delivered years before, but ended up getting left behind and working for the company instead. As you would imagine, she is a bit of an outcast around the stalks and is often ignored. Junior does not have the heart to fire violet, so instead he sends her to ""work"" in the abandoned postal unit. Meanwhile, a young boy who is unaware of the companies changes orders a baby to play with... Eager to please her colleagues, Violet processes the letter and makes a baby to be delivered... much to Juniors horror. Now the two must work together to rid of their mistake before the current boss and employees of the company finds out! Not only is this movie incredibly emotional, it's one of the funniest animated films I have ever seen. I adore Andy Sanberg and his performance as Junior is stellar! Violet is also an incredibly likeable character and I'm sure the audience will be rooting for her like I was!I beg you, please watch this movie! Ignore the reviews, many are negative due to the mediocre animation and simple story, but this doesn't mean the entire product is bad! This is leagues above boss baby and deserves much more praise!"
" Not above criticism
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,7,"Tulip was left undelivered when Cornerstone ( a delivery service run by storks) cancelled the baby delivery side of its business. She now works for Cornerstone but Junior, delegated to fire her, cannot bring himself to do so. The two of them embark on delivering a new baby to an eagerly awaiting family while sneaky *rse-lickerToady seeks to scupper them in order to curry favour with heartless boss Hunter.This CGI feature gives us two loveable protagonists: Junior, would-be heartless boss but with a heart, and Tulip, well-meaning but klutzy, and a little lost soul. We also have two villains: big boss Hunter (beautifully voiced by Kelsey Grammer) and odious, treacherous sycophant Toady, a desperately unfunny ""humorous"" character with the worst vocal characterisation since Steve Martin in Looney Tunes: Back In Action.My concern about this movie is that it is not very friendly towards kids who are, presumably, its main target. The story, while not over-complex, is fairly dense and may lose younger viewers, and much of the dialogue is rapid-fire with references which are aimed at adults more than youngsters.Having said that, there is a lot of humour, especially visual slapstick humour, and the emotional payoffs - and there are a fair number of them - are broadly presented so that all ages should be able to register them.With the exception of Toady, character design is good, set/location design is excellent (albeit the baby-making machinery, while dazzling, is extremely busy - just because you can use CGI to achieve complexity doesn't always mean that you should: less can often be more effective than more).The babies, of which there are literally thousands, and especially the featured baby, are unbearably cute, and thankfully avoid ""so sweet they may make you puke"" status.I did like this - I preferred it to the recent Trolls by a small margin - but I think older kids will enjoy it more than younger ones."
" Very forgettable.
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,5,"I don't really have that much to say about this movie. Its not bad necessarily. The plot is a bit predictable and yet all over the place. The animation is ok. Its kinda funny. I didn't laugh much. There's a lot of cringeworthy moments. There is a love story between a human and a bird for some reason? I don't know why I saw this in theaters. Its not worth its runtime. I guess you could put it on for a kid. Its very boring though, despite how bizarre it gets."
" Storks is surprisingly rather heartfelt.
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,6,"Honestly, I went in thinking this was going to be another mass manufactured lifeless animation (I'm looking at you Illumination...). But...there is actually some substance. Yes, a film about storks delivering babies (or lack of...) slowly became a coming-of-age animation about parenthood and family. In a world where storks deliver packages, a depiction of Amazon's idyllic dream of drone deliveries, a stork and orphan accidentally create a baby and must deliver said baby to the family who requested it. Silly lighthearted plot aside, the third act is surprisingly heavy and brimming with emotion. The themes of family, parental nurturing and teamwork are all of a sudden injected into the slightly lifeless first and second act. Making the third act rather touching. The film's story is well paced and continuously kept me engaged. A shaky start but I gradually became invested. The characters themselves were hit and miss. Their aesthetics are memorable, yet their personalities aren't which makes it difficult to like them. They are just there. There is a weird pigeon that somewhat stills every scene, I guess it's appropriate comedic timing. The voice acting was very bland. The one-dimensional characters meant that they could be voiced by anyone and so the overall execution felt generic. The animation was stunning, an extremely high-quality finish to each scene. For the first time ever (and hopefully the last), I can say that babies looked absolutely adorable. I succumbed to the cuteness much like the transformational pack of wolves did. Annoyingly in popular animations some pop songs are embedded into the film, which as you all know just irritate me. I want to watch a film, not consistently sing a Jason Derulo song in my head. An eternal nightmare. But but but, I honestly thought this was going to bad. I was pleasantly surprised. The third act alone saves the film from being an unmemorable animated flick. Worth a watch I would say."
" Brief exposure to baby cuteness!!
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,7,"Here's a Better Late than Never review of ""Storks"" (PG - 2016 - US)...Pretty adorable!!Genre: Animated/FamilyMy Score: 7.4Cast=8 Acting=6 Plot=4 Ending=9 Story=6 Art=9 Voice=10 Music=6 Family=10 Funny=6Storks have moved on from delivering babies to packages. But when an order for a baby appears, the best delivery stork must scramble to fix the error by delivering the baby. ""Just a brief exposure to baby cuteness can ruin your life!"" This actually turned out to be a special delivery...not first class mail, but I was willing to sign for it. Although I did not like the premise, this ultimate family movie more than caught up with some great voice overs and a solid ending. Your wolf pack will not form a broken heart after this one...it ended up softening mine. I recommend this for families with younger children...the cute level was a high 8 with a diaper and big eyes."
" Definitely one of my favourite animated movies ever!
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,10,"***May contain spoilers*** When I sat down to watch the movie I had neutral feelings..A friend suggested it to me and I checked the trailer immediately. I really liked it and I was already laughing on the silent fight scene at the end of the trailer,so I decided to watch it that night. BEST CHOICE OF THE DAY! While watching the trailer I felt kinda weird about watching a movie where storks deliver babies and basically most of the scenes are about a baby,but then I started watching the movie. My God! I was literally smiling trough the whole movie...Because of the jokes,cute scenes and for god's sake...That heartwarming ending. I feel free to add that even a few tears came out when Tulip flew away with Jasper to find her family,when the baby was finally delivered and when Tulip was reunited with her parents and family.. The whole movie made me melt. The characters were just WOW..I could totally relate to Junior and Tulip as well...Junior is that type of person who is not sure about what he really wants,the one trying to seem tough but is the one who's the most emotional and who needs the most love,who's kindness,care and softness grows to the end of the movie. Tulip is simply the best kind of person you can ask for a friend. She's kind,loving,loyal,she's funny,she's energetic and very joyful. All she seeks is her family,but once a baby has to be delivered,she's ready to sacrifice her machine built for the role to fly away and find her parents to help the baby girl find her family first,hoping that she can find her's too eventually.Tulip and Junior are #friendshipgoals. They fight a lot,but they realize that they can't be without each other. Also they can perfectly work together to solve various problems together,as a team.The visuals of the movie are amazing.. The movie was ADORABLE! Not only the visuals (of course Diamond Destiny did the thing) but the story itself..The movie is about ''finding your flock''.. Is about finding the real meaning of your life,finding your family,finding happiness,finding that thing which makes you feel full. It's also about the time spent together with your loved ones on the Gartner family's perspective. Nate is a very honorable character as well in that case and seeing the parents actually being there with him, being there for him is heartwarming.This movie is a roller coaster of emotions..In the beginning,you may feel confused,questioning the story and the logic of the movie,then you start enjoining it,smiling at the many jokes the characters make, blasting out in laughter at the wolf chasing scene,melting during the scenes featuring the beloved trio (Junior,Tulip and the baby) and you'll even feel some tears rolling down your face time to time. If you're an emotional snowflake like me,you will find yourself finishing the movie in tears,but with a wide smile.The soundtrack is one of the best things in the movie. Even as a huge metalhead,I found myself singing She Was,Fire and the Flood and Holding Out every day after watching Storks. I added the songs on my list right there among Arch Enemy and Nightwish and whenever one of them starts,I'm grabbing my phone to turn it up.I suggest Storks for those who want to be a part of far one of the cutest and funniest stories ever made. Some people may think it's childish,but always look for the actual meaning and the story it tries to tell,your opinion will change with a good chance.I simply love it! (Sorry for grammar mistakes..English is not my native language.)"
" Cuteness OVERLOAD !!!
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,9,"Lots and lots & Lots of cute babies in the movie. The concept of the movie is very simple. Its hilarious, emotional (at times) and very touchy movie. I would recommend this movie to all age groups right from small kids to adults. Great movie for entire family.Hope you all will like it."
" Wacky Flick for the Whole Family
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,7,"In 2016, Nicholas Stoller (Get Him to the Greek & Neighbors) and Doug Sweetland (Presto) presented Storks, an animated film from Warner Bros. Animation Group (The Lego Movie). While it had a mixed critical reception, it's definitely a movie that typical movie-goers and families may find adorable and funny?The main plot centers on a stork company that delivers packages and babies. When the top delivery stork, Junior, becomes boss of the workers, he is told to fire the only human working there, Orphan Tulip. Instead of firing her, he sends her to the defunct mail room. Meanwhile, the son of two workaholic parents, Nate Gardner, sends a letter to the company asking for a baby sibling to play with. When the letter arrives, it creates a baby, so now Junior and Tulip have to deliver the baby to it's guardians while going through many obstacles like avoiding getting noticed by the company's CEO Hunter, a pack of hysterical wolves, and trying to care for the baby itself. In concept, the film has all the right ideas to make a charming comedy for the whole family, and it mostly succeeds in it's execution. Even though the journey Junior and Tulip go on feels similar to almost every Pixar film (e.g. Inside Out and Finding Nemo), the film gives the characters enough time to develop off each other, where they came from, and what each other's goals are, even if their quirky eccentric personalities don't always contrast that well. The subplot featuring Nate and his family, however, does come off as rather straightforward and it's easy to guess what will happen since all his goal is to have a baby sibling. It doesn't help that the movie itself does come with some tired film clichés, not just the duo who overcome each other on their obstacles, but also the workaholic parents who try to make their son happy, the big promotion from one job to another, the side villain finding out where the heroes are, and even how the main villain tries to get rid of the protagonists.As for the rest of the characters, the CEO of the company Hunter at first comes off as a trustworthy boss, but there's quite a nerve he has with babies which presents him as threatening and cunning. The pigeon Toady can either be amusing or annoying with his exaggerated ""bro"" voice, but he's also a decent deuteragonist as he only follows his orders to make the most of his job. As stated before, the Gardner family have the same trope of the little kid who wants his busy parents to spend more time with him, so they decide to bond with him more to make him happy. And then there are the wolves led by the alpha and beta, who deliver the absolute funniest parts of the movie due to their personalities constantly shifting from menacing to energetically adoring the baby, as well as performing the best visual gags in the film.However, if there are two things this movie really nailed in the execution, it would be the heart and the humor. The filmmakers definitely knew when to have cute sentimental moments with the baby, and they always come off as adorable instead of schmaltzy. Also, when the movie's main characters have their moments of relief and sentimentality, it gives the film a lighthearted tone that never comes out randomly, and portrays the scene with just the right emotion to make the audience feel for them. However, the humor would have to be the highlight of the movie, as there's plenty of one liners, visual gags, surprisingly decent pop culture jokes, slapstick, subversion and line deliveries, and it's very rare when they miss their mark as they have such exquisite timing and charm to them. Also, since Junior and Tulip do spend the journey caring for the baby, they spend time feeding and trying to put the baby to sleep, which also makes the movie relatable to any parents who raised their own offspring. Since the movie acts more on the cartoony side, it creates the animation to be as cartoony as it can, and it did the job beautifully. The characters look kinda simplistic, but given the silly nature of the film, they contrast well, and their movements can get exaggerated and wacky at just the right moments. Although some of the places they leads go to range from a cave, to the Arctic, to suburbs, the animators still give the backgrounds life and present them in colorful, unique, vibrant, and bright manners. The effects animation is also quite creative such as the factory robots, the water, the machine that creates babies, and even some of the lights and electrical effects. The only criticism there is to give the animation is that many of the storks look like the exact same model (probably by means of cheaping out a bit), but they don't ruin the sporadically wonderful quality that the visuals have to offer.While Storks may not have flown as high up as other animated films of 2016 such as Kung Fu Panda 3, Zootopia and Kubo & the Two Strings, it did offer enough good laughs, silly concepts, well crafted animation and memorable characters to stand on it's own. If you're in the mood for a cute little family comedy with some relatability to those who have raised babies before, then this will be a delight from beginning to end, especially since it knows who to aim itself towards. If Nicholas Stoller and Doug Sweetland can do this good of a job with cartoony movies, then I can't wait to see what they have in store next for animation.like Captain Underpants, nice job Nick."
" You're Fired!
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,7,"Storks no longer deliver babies. They have a large warehouse not named Amazon, where they deliver packages and hopefully life won't imitate art. Tulip, is a undelivered human who works there and messes things up. Her most recent error is to process a baby delivery which involves a long perilous formula trek.The theme once again is family and friends, give up that electronic device to bond with your kid(s). The kids seemed to like the film, while I had a hard time getting into the characters, finding Tulip's situation sad as were her cute antics as in talking to herself. The film had some funny moments, mostly for the kids."
" Unexpectedly fun
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,7,"This film does not try to hard with the humour which makes it all the more endearing. The dialogue is good, and the pace keeps up the adventurous journey.The voice-overs are all done so well. I am glad I came across this perhaps underrated fun movie."
" Nope.
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,1,"I was so disappointed. This is possibly the worst cartoon I watched. At 44mins in, I haven't laughed once. It is borderline painful to watch how a somewhat cute idea was so badly delivered. The script is just ridiculously awful and forced with idiotic jokes. I expected an easy to watch, cute kids movie, but watching Storks became almost a challenge to see how long can I endure wasting my time watching this pointless thing."
" This Movie is Really Great, Deserves My own Oscars xD
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,10,"In my opinion This is the best Animation movie of the year 2016 and frankly 2017 too :DI dunno why this under rated, coz this movie is really funny, has a good story, very very nice Animation and production,I must say though that storks delivery company would defiantly beats Amazon. hhhhhhh, obviously Amazon can't deliver kids :Dthis movie is actually asks you a question, for the life, for your purpose. for your existence, your might be in a wrong place but that will never limit your imagination and spirit and your ambitious dreams to make them come true.. i loved the spirit in the movie it's really incentive.i really really enjoyed watching that movie. it's adventurous Action a lot of comedy . also i admire very much the animation work and effort that has been done to the movie, it was Amazing and yet sooo much funny :Dall of that made me watch it two times , and i definitely give it a 10 , thumb upGreat thanks to all of the team, i would really recommend you see ityou will never regret thathave fun ;)"
" Very boring and chaotic
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,4,"Storks seemed like a good kids movie you would watch just to get out of the house and go to the theater, but I found that storks is very boring and fast paced. Many of the jokes fell flat and felt forced, speaking of forced, the parents. The parents are absolutely terrible characters and suddenly go from being responsible to downright stupid and unrealistic. Many of the scenes are rushed and the characters actions and dialogue left me confused. Over all, storks is a waste of time movie to watch once and never again."
" See this movie only if you want to laugh......a lot........
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,10,"Storks is one of my all-time top 10 favorite movies ever. The story line is compelling, the humor is belly-laugh outrageous, and the creativity is superb. What's disappointing is that it isn't more popular, because when I saw it, I was sure ""wolf pack, form (insert random noun here)"" would become part of our cultural vernacular. The pigeon scene (how do you like me now?!) was snort-milk-out-your-nose funny. The brilliance of the writing is that instead of relying on tired, over-used 'bad guy' scenes to move plot ahead, even the what-you-think-will-turn-into-scary-scenes have a way of turning on a dime and becoming screamingly funny."
" b movie
",2017-05-22 00:00:00,8,"Storks have moved on from delivering babies to packages. But when an order for a baby appears, the best delivery stork must scramble to fix the error by delivering the baby.The story was very unique and useful for the kids to understand the important of family, and never judge a person from its look. The voice Andy Samberg and Katie Crown duo voice was amazing and funny in the film, Kelsey Grammar was great in his sentences. The music and sound effects were not that good, but the graphics were amazing."
" An extremely fun and delightful experience
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,10,"This movie was what I was expecting from an animated movie, funny, cute and with a touch of inspiration and real life value. The movie talks about the Storks who run a company, cornerstore . com who used to deliver babies, I'm not going to go way too deep in the plot or give spoilers, but all I can say that, it's really fun to watch and is very humorous, and is a great, clean, fun entertainment for the whole family."
" The wolves.. THE WOLVES.
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,8,"Highly recommended. The movie constantly makes fun of both itself, and family-raising tropes and injects the importance of communication in digestible doses.Although I don't have any spoilers in here, I do mention a couple of specific scenes. This won't ruin your experience of the movie, I promise.This is a great entry into the 'animated family friendly / oriented' genre. The beginning was a little slow to be sure, possibly uninteresting, even.... but 10 minutes in and I'm hooked. It had great chemistry, and the mom-dad type interactions between some of the character pairs were clearly inspired by parents who have been there, recently enough to remember the humour and challenges of early child-raising. That's clear, even to someone who's never had children of their own.Emotionally, it tugs at a few strings, but not to the point of needing tissues; it's light and humorous, tackling the importance of family bonding in a positive way.Warning; If you have young ones going to see this, I think that you should likely make sure they know where babies come from, as this film raises this question in a provocative way, and young inquisitive minds..... well. Let's just say it's a question that begs an answer.Also, the wolves. oh and the penguins. Both are hilarious and cleverly done, and the movie using silence in a creative and funny way to make light of how every-other-film-ever uses mood music to artificially amp up action scenes.Genius."
" cute but boring
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,5,"Storks have always delivered babies from their Stork Mountain. It was a sacred duty until 18 years ago when Jasper tried to raise orphan Tulip after a botched delivery. Leader Hunter (Kelsey Grammar) stopped delivering babies and started delivering packages. The storks are now delivering for Cornerstore.com. Hunter promises Junior (Andy Samberg) to be the future boss if he fires Tulip who is a constant headache. Junior takes pity and keeps Tulip in the abandoned part of the facility to head up the non-existent letters department. Nate Gardner wants to have a baby sibling. He writes a letter to the storks which generates a baby from the Baby Making Machine. Junior is injured and must join Tulip in flying an old flying machine to deliver the adorable baby.The setup and the story is too complicated for this simple animated movie. The characters are suitably cute and lovely. It lacks a compelling villain and the plot rambles around. Ultimately, it's a brightly-colored but boring adventure. The character construction is solid but the writing needs help. Kids may like some of the wacky colorful fun but it's not much more than that."
" a good adventure in delivering a baby
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,10,"This is another bird's animated movie after 'Angry bird'. This story is about a boy who wishes to have a baby brother. After receiving the message, a girl and a stork struggles to deliver the baby to the boy. This is my favorite birds movie. If you are movie fan of 'Angry bird' I suggest not to miss this movie."
" A heartwarming story about family values
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,9,I loved how the movie reflects family values. The problem of modern times is that we can fall into the trap of working for no purpose and all the time. This movie makes me appreciate the miracle of life. The wolves formation were really unbelievable but definitely entertaining :)
" A silly, but fun movie.
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,7,"""Storks"" is one of those movies that looked pretty bad from what the trailers advertised. The film looked like a very stupid comedy made by Warner Animation Group, the studio that took the world by storm with ""The Lego Movie"". It also didn't help with the writer of the film was Nicholas Stoller, a writer I wasn't very fond of (he wrote the new Muppet movies which I really don't like). But, much to my surprise, I did like this film. Was it great? No, it wasn't a movie I'd watch over and over again, but for the most part it was fine. Not a bad kids movie as the advertisements made it out to be, but certainly not great. It has problems that hold it from being a complete piece, but it was a fun movie to watch.We all know that babies are delivered by Storks, delivered through the clouds from a mountaintop, but unknown to us humans, the storks are getting annoyed delivering the babies as they are problematic and get the storks into some serious danger. So, they decide to quit and move into the online store business forming a sort of Amazon clone called Cornerstone.com. And so, eighteen years later, a stork named Junior (Andy Samberg)  is about to be promoted to boss by the CEO of the company Hunter (Kelsey Grammar) after being the top deliver of packages for the company. But before he can become boss, he has to fire the only human employee of the company, an eighteen year old named Tulip (Katie Crown) who is in fact one of the reasons that the storks quit baby delivering eighteen years ago. Unable to fire her though, Junior moves her to the mail room in the old baby factory with really nothing to do. However, after a optimistic young boy named Nate Gardner sends a letter to Storks asking for a baby brother, which accidentally creates a baby, Junior (who accidentally broke his wing) and Tulip decide to quickly deliver the baby without the company knowing so Junior can become boss.""Storks"" seems really silly from the way I wrote the plot, and yeah, it basically is. But, it's silly in a good way. It's fun and funny at times which is usually high praise for a goofy kids movie. It's animation is great. It's colorful, fast, and sometimes, it can be pretty to look at. The characters of the movie are also fun. I particularly like the character of Tulip. She's goofy and silly and has a pretty funny scene with her playing other people out of boredom with nothing to do in the mail room. Junior is funny at times. Although he wasn't great, I had some respect for him in a way. The wolves (Key and Peele) are also pretty hilarious too. Wanting to make the baby part of the pack, they actually would do anything to get it back, even taking on the forms of different kinds of object like boats, submarines, even a bridge. My biggest problem with the film is I think it would have been better of as a Cartoon Network miniseries rather than a movie based on the way it was edited. The film would randomly cut to black and then start again oddly as it was edited like a miniseries made into a movie. It took me out of the experience for a while, but I was able to get back into the goofy nature of the movie.So, would I see ""Storks"" again? Probably not, but I will admit that I did like the movie for what it is. A silly, but fun animated comedy. With good characters, some bright animation and a fun story, I thought it was a pretty good kids film. Not great by any means, but fine. While it is not a must watch, I think it's worth one watch if you have the time."
" Threadbare. Uneven. Underrated. HYSTERICALLY Funny.
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,7,"I found STORKS in the way that you're supposed to find underrated/cult classics: by accident. When it was released, I bought into the collective sigh of underwhelm that most critics expressed and that was my mistake. It's easy to understand why the critical community didn't like it: in an era where Pixar, Disney and even Dreamworks keep churning out magnificently multi-layered heart-warmers that set the bar stratospherically high, STORKS doesn't register all that well. We've been spoiled by excellence. As a result, we've lost the ability to enjoy the simple pleasures of pure entertainment.And that's what STORKS delivers better than babies or packages: entertainment.You might have noticed people commenting on how forced and thin the storyline is and how uneven it feels, and those complaints are accurate. The plot is extremely thin (virtually an extended sitcom-sized premise stretched into an epic road-trip format), and the story moves so quickly that it goes too far too fast with nary any breathing room to savor the experience or give the characters the tension or time to build any real catharsis or change. But the characters are so authentic to themselves that you know just about everything you need to know about them from their first scenes.I think the main reason STORKS gets such middling reviews in print and here on IMDb is because it's an old-fashioned type of comedy: a screwball-slapstick hybrid. The emphasis on sight gags, pain-humor, and wackiness has generally been avoided in animated films as passe and vulgar--low comedy. The rapid-fire snark between the main characters of Tulip and Junior hearken back to the old Howard Hawks workplace comedies of the 1930s, which is definitely an acquired taste in the post-narrative style of humor found in kids entertainment today--where non-sequiturs and punchlines exist in a vacuum and visual comedy is derived from abstraction rather than plasticity. But the comedic energy and the variety of jokes from modern ""Office""-style cringe (Pigeon Toady) to the machine-gun-speed HIS GIRL FRIDAYy-style verbal sparring (Tulip & Junior), absurdism (the wolves), post-modern meta-humor (the boy and his parents) to classical WB slapstick of yesteryear, and the film is riotously funny because of it. At the end of the day, that's what STORKS wants to be: FUNNY.STORKS is not a great film. It's not a masterpiece like TOY STORY or UP. It won't win any Oscars and it won't be everyone's cup of tea. But there's an excellent chance that it will live on as a multi-generational favorite for the same reasons as dumb-fun-with-a-heart-of-gold treasures like SPACEBALLS, DUMB & DUMBER, THE NAKED GUN, and NATIONAL LAMPOONS CHRISTMASs VACATION:Because you can watch it 1,000 times and it will NEVER stop being funny.So try it out. There's a 50-50 chance you'll be among the ones who can't stop watching it."
" Good enough
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,4,"It's really sad that this animation didn't get enough credit as others. The reviews I've read about it, mostly by critics, were bad, mainly characterising it as a waste of time. And yet, after watching it, I can say for sure that it wasn't so bad. Yes, it's not Frozen or even Minions, but it's cute and has babies in it!! (come on! you can't go wrong with babies in a movie for children). The main story is clever: the storks have changed their baby business into a simple delivery network that has more profit. But then, an orphan who had never been delivered to her real family due to an accident, accidentally creates a baby for a family and she and her stork boss have to deliver the baby secretly so no one can find out. The film is quite funny and had some cute moments, even moving ones, with the parents who ignore their child, the stork who wants to get the big raise, even the wolf pack was funny (okay, that pigeon was creepy though!). Sure, it wasn't very original and the ending was predictable, but the movie is satisfying enough, so 4 out of 10."

" Very Nice Movie :)
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,7,"As simple as that.I just wanted to say that this movie kept me interested all the way through, had a really nice story, nice music, likable characters and voices.Time flew past when watching it, the 90 minutes felt like about 45 minutes, there was plenty of action, great animation plus the babies were sooo kyoot...blah at spelling it correctly. :pIt was a welcome return of entertainment from a animated movie after that annoying Trolls movie with it's bad and cheesy awful singing every few minutes.Would I want a sequel...nah...was so nice as it was...but then again I would watch the sequel. ;)I thought it was a nice little nod at Aliens movie too but it does not list it in connections with the giant yellow machine..no?...well I thought so...so there. :pAs for the Wolfpack lol, they stole the show. Now a spin off with them would be kewl...haha spell check is gonna moan at this pfttt to it. :D Wolfpack submarine ...ping ping ping ...hahaha...too funny.Overall it's a user friendly fun movie for all the family. :)"
" a Good film
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,7,"Storks is a solid, well-made movie that viewers of all ages should be able to enjoy. It doesn't scale the emotional heights of some of 2016's other animated offerings (like Zootopia and Finding Dory), but it still has important morals that speak volumes to kids and adults. The positives outweigh the negatives, and Storks' merits make it worth checking out on the big screen. Families looking for a fun time at the theater won't be disappointed by what Stoller and company have to offer them. well ! after I finished watching this film, I quickly added to the list of my favorite films. Wolves were my favorite characters, they've made me laugh hard."
" Awful movie
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,1,"I have been using IMDb to view ratings for years, but I had to create an account to review this movie.Storks was truly awful. Even our 4 year old said he didn't want to watch it after about 15 minutes. Thank goodness because we were also not wanting to watch it anymore (Two adults and a 14 year old).Our son will watch almost anything, including some of the low budget animated movies you find on Netflix.The conversations the characters are having seem quite odd. They are talking fast with random comments that don't really seem to fit any narrative.It was like watching a bunch of ADHD characters amped on up caffeine spouting out random thoughts to try and be funny. Sure, a few moments like that can be funny, but we just did not find much humor in this movie."
" Amazing
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,8,"I watched this a few nights ago and I just bawled my eyes out. yes, the story makes little logic, but I think that is the point. It isn't meant for critical eyed adults who scrutinize everything but for kids to enjoy. however, it is a light hearted and funny movie with hidden jokes for adults and I believe it is suitable for the whole family. I absolutely loved it. the ending had me in tears. there are some hidden meanings in the story, about acceptance, and what it means to be a family and cherishing those around you. it carries a great massage hidden within the comedy. someone in a vouge article said that the comedy fell flat, and to that I say f** off it is amazing."
" Fast paced, hilarious, absurd and slightly evil
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,10,"Saw it on a long flight, had never even heard of this movie before despite us watching anime and cartoon regularly. What happened there WB?? So I ended up seeing it more by coincidence - the same as many other adults on the 5 hour flight. And the plane was full of laughter. One of the most absurd and hilarious movies I've seen in a long time. It is very fast paced, lots of word play and verbal humor, slightly evil in touching all kinds of topics from career-nuts adults, over-ambition and sacrificing it all, bullying, casual nastiness to people. Delivered by a fast-talking, bright, very cheeky teen girl with a big heart and a stork trying to keep up and sorting it all into his very structure perspective on life. Go watch it!"
" Hectic and Hard to Watch
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,3,"This movie was very hard to watch. The hectic pace and scatter-brained delivery of the ""Tulip"" character left both my wife and I occasionally wandering the online world looking for relief. The story line was cute, but all the jabber-jabber-jabber behavior. Frankly, speaking most especially of Tulip, any child of mine that acted with such disrespect toward others. We did like the character of Jasper played by Danny Trejo and liked the revenge of the small angry-birds, but the show just didn't rank with us. Lastly, we're supportive of homosexuals, but delivering a child via stork to lesbians? Storks deliver adopted children? There comes a point where representation is no longer valuable, and that scene felt more like indoctrinating children than including same-sex affection into mainstream presentation. But, I suppose that's the world we live in --- one where political inclusiveness appears more important than actually making a good story (or, at least, one in which the inclusion of the scene has anything to do with the movie at all)."
" Totally underrated movie
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"I admit this movie is not on my watch list.In the beginning of this movie I can't stop my mind to think why they create this world-a world the baby is delivered by storks.This is no sense and totally different world with the real world.Why? In the end of movie I think it give me the reason.In the final scene, the storks start to deliver baby again we can see so many family receive a baby include Same-sex marriage couple.In such a Utopian world, we don't need a man and woman to get a baby. We just write a letter to storks.I see so many good idea in this movie.Baby is most wonderful thing in the world no one want hurt baby > Everyone told you that you want to be boss, but most important is what do you want to do after be a boss The funny scene in this movie make me laugh loudly"
" Underrated - this movie is one of the best animated films out there
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,10,"If you want a movie that is entertaining, funny, action-packed with twists and turns throughout - then this movie is for you! The animation quality is as good as any out there. The voice actors are sensational. Kelsey Grammar and Andy Samberg and their back and forth bantering is totally brilliant and any of us involved in business can understand the dynamic and completely understand the humour.It is one of those movies that you can watch again and again and never get bored.Kids love it and there is plenty of content to keep adults laughing.This movie is a terrific and I can't understand how anyone could not thoroughly enjoy this movie!"
" best cartoon so far in 2016
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,9,"After watching the trailer I got excited for watching the Storks movie and the promises where at least 'good fun'. Storks is undoubtedly funny and keeps up with the audience attention just enough in spite of an at par performance in pretty much all departments. Let me start by saying that I don't this film is a 10/10 but hopefully my rating will add to its overall rating. This is a best cartoon for family.Stork Mountain was a place known for delivering babies and its employees are primarily storks, along with a few other birds. Their current CEO, a stork named Hunter (Kelsey Grammar), discontinued the baby delivering business, seeing more profit by having storks operate a parcel delivery service called Cornerstore. Tulip (Katie Crown), having just turned 18 years old, is working to promote new ideas for Cornerstore, but they always backfire. Meanwhile Junior (Andy Samberg), Cornerstore's top delivery stork, is about to be promoted to boss of Cornerstore while Hunter is the boss of cornerstone now and he will be chairman of the board. Hunter demand Junior to fire Tulip but Junior cannot find the heart to fire Tulip due to her kindness and hard work, and he lies to her that she is being transferred to the mail room, instructing her to never leave her new office space.Meanwhile, a young boy named Nate Gardner (Anton Starkman) feels lonely because his parents, Henry (Ty Burrell) and Sarah (Jennifer Aniston), are too busy to spend time with him and he want to have another brother. Nate Gardner found ad about old stork deliver baby and he writes a letter asking for a baby brother with ninja skills and sends it to Cornerstore. The letter makes its way to Tulip, who reluctantly leaves the mail room to put the letter in a slot just outside the room despite Junior's attempt to stop her, injury his wing in the process. To their surprise, a baby girl is created inside a metal container, whom they later name Diamond Destiny.Junior agrees to secretly help deliver Diamond Destiny. As Junior's wing is broken, they use Tulip's flying machine for transportation. However, they crash into a frozen tundra and they met group of wolfs who leaders named Alpha (Keegan-Michael Key) and Beta (Jordan Peele). The two manage to save Diamond Destiny, whom the wolves have fallen in love with baby. At last, Junior, Tulip and baby diamond escape from group of wolfs.Back at Cornerstore, a pigeon employee named Toady (Stephen Kramer Glickman) learns of Diamond Destiny's existence. Toady told Hunter about the baby then he promises to give Toady Junior's position as the boss as they scramble the coordinates Junior and Tulip have been following to mislead them to a different location. Junior is captured and tied up by Hunter and his cronies at the false location and they kidnap Diamond Destiny. While Tulip follow the Jasper to her lost family. However, Tulip comes to rescue Junior without having met her family and the two resend themselves back to Cornerstore. After fighting an army of penguins, Junior and Tulip are chased into the abandoned baby making room and start up the machine as a distraction. As thousands of babies are being made, Hunter angrily confronts Junior and Tulip with a large robotic machine, but Junior refuses to surrender Diamond Destiny with Hunter's re-offered promotion. With the infant's playfulness, Junior and Tulip are able to cause the machine along with Hunter to fall off the cliff elevating the collapsing Cornerstore.Junior rallies the storks, as well as the other birds, to help deliver the babies to the families who wanted them including the Gardners, and Nate accepts having a sister when he realizes that she has the ninja skills he asked for in the letter. The storks, former employees of Cornerstore, and the wolf pack reunite Tulip with her expanded family, and she and Junior continue their job of delivering babies as co-bosses of Stork Mountain."
" Big surprise
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,7,"Storks wasn't specifically on my watch list. I had seen ads here and there, but it seemed to get overshadowed with the release of other movies. When i got the chance to watch it on a flight, i took it. Mostly because there was nothing else to watch. I ended up laughing out loud a couple of times and being charmed by some of the characters. The movie was cute and a little awkward at times, and had a fun and not too serious premise. The awkwardness is especially what drew me in. This movie might not be for everyone, the comedy might be a bit too obvious and cringy, and kids might not understand the humor at times. I personally don't think those are bad things, since i enjoy that type of humor. The voice acting was okay. I mean Andy Samberg was Andy Samberg and Ty Burell was Ty Burell. I enjoy both actors very much, but it made it hard for me to get into their characters. Stephen Kramer Glickman, Kelsey Grammar and Danny Trejo were outstanding in their performance. Overall this movie was a fun ride, and took me by surprise. I got a little lost in the storytelling sometimes, and wasn't sure what 'message' they were trying to convey. But overall it was enjoyable and cute, and not every movie needs a 'message'. I'm not sure if every kid will enjoy this movie, but i think adults who like awkward humor and great animation (I forgot to mention that) will enjoy this movie. This movie is definitely underrated and got drowned out by other (hyped) animated movies that got released around the same time. 7,5"
" Hopefully the Warner Animation Group keeps this up.
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,7,"'STORKS': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The new computer-animated comedy from Warner Animation Group; which had it's first big hit in several years, with 2014's 'THE LEGO MOVIE'. 'STORKS' tells the story of a world where storks once delivered babies to expecting parents, but now the business has been turned into a parcel delivering service instead (because it's more profitable). When a new baby is accidentally produced, the lead delivery stork, and an adult human orphan (who was accidentally never delivered as a child), set out to make sure the new baby reaches it's destination. The film was directed by Nicholas Stoller and Doug Sweetland (in his feature directorial debut), and it was written by Stoller (who's also helmed such hit comedies as 'FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL', 'GET HIM TO THE Greek', 'NEIGHBORS' and 'NEIGHBORS 2: SORRORITY ROW'; as well as co-written such hit kids' movies as 'THE MUPPETS', 'MUPPETS MOST WANTED' and 'GULLIVER'S TRAVELS'). It stars the voice talents of Andy Samberg, Katie Crown, Kelsey Grammar, Jennifer Aniston, Ty Burrell, Anton Starkman, Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele and Danny Trejo. The film was a hit at the Box Office (although it didn't do nearly as well as 'THE LEGO MOVIE'), and it's gotten mostly good reviews from critics. I watched it with my nephews, and their father, and we all had a good time.Years ago, storks used to deliver babies to their parents; from a baby producing business at Stork Mountain. Then the company's CEO, a stork named Hunter (Grammer), decided there was more money to be made delivering parcels. Before the business stopped delivering babies though, a baby girl named Tulip was accidentally not delivered to her parents. So the storks raised her, and employed her at their new company (now called Cornerstone). When Tulip turns 18 though (now voiced by Crown), she becomes a nuisance to the business; and Hunter tells his top employee, Junior (Samberg), to fire her. Junior doesn't have the courage to do it though, and when a new baby is ordered, and accidentally produced by the two of them, the duo teams up to deliver it.The movie is beautifully animated, and pretty funny (at times). It's even slightly touching, at the end, but it never gets too serious. The cast is all great in their roles, and I think Stoller definitely has talent in writing/directing kids' movies. It's a little weird, given that his adult comedy films are so vulgar and raunchy (and I love them that way). The film is definitely not in the same league as 'THE LEGO MOVIE', but it's also definitely better than most animated kids' movies these days. Hopefully Warner Animation Group keeps this up.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc"
" Surprisingly great and extremely funny
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,9,"I have to admit, the subject material for the movie didn't entice me to watch it. But once I did get around to seeing it, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience! Though I found the two leading characters (Junior and Tulip) to be the most bland characters in the whole movie, this was easily mediated with by the many, many, redeeming qualities of the movie. From the colourful, original and hilarious supporting characters, to the lovely animation and design, through a fast paced, original, and twist filled script and the dynamic editing and flow of the movie. More then anything else, though, what I found most enjoyable about storks was how downright funny the movie was. Jam-packed with jokes and funny moments, the laughs-per-minute count was off the chart, with many memorable and hilarious moments. The movie was a joy to watch and to laugh to, and I recommend it for any constellation- be it to watch on your own, with friends, or the whole family."
