" The worst cash grab
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,1,"Enough is enough. Stop making these movies, you are tarnishing the first two movies."
" Too bad
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,2,"A Era do Gelo: O Big Bang guys talk about this series of films that animated generations and today is just marketing. The film is very cliché even for children, and I feel sorry for the parents who go to watch with their children, because they think of a film with super childish and weak jokes, even more that they changed the jokes for our Brazilian daily life, the only one good thing in the film is the lesson that all species need to come together to save planet earth.Film reviewed on the 18th to the 19th of March 2021."
" everything I liked about the first film is gone.
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,1,"I thought the first Ice Age was okay, it had animation that was passible for the time and the plot was kind of a copy of Shrek and Monsters Inc. An then they made 4 sequels each one worse that the last. And I Hope this is the final chapter because they had officially ran out of ideas."
" Apparently y'all didn't enjoy Ice Age that much
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,10,"Seriously what's the deal with these negative reviews? This movie is great like the other sequels! The scrat segments were actually interesting seeing him in space, there are actually some really cool scenes there, not going to spoil them but they are worth watching. Other than that, the movie overall is actually not bad. People are just getting tired of the Ice Age franchise especially after Ice Age Continental Drift but I haven't! Ice Age Collision Course may have sillier moments than the first 4 movies but they're not a problem honestly. And Sid meets someone, not spoiling that either but you'll be surprised. So if you really like Ice Age and watched 1-4, then don't hesitate adding this next to your list. It's a fun enjoyable continuation of Manny, Diego, Sid, Peaches, and the rest of the gang on another crazy hilarious adventure that they must survive in. It really doesn't deserve THIS much hate I mean come on like would you rather watch Shrek 3?"
" A really bad movie
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,1,"As I have said when I reviewed Continental Drift, I was a huge fan of Ice Age until the 4th one came out. I have watched this movie on TV..... I'm sorry I have to say this, but I think this movie was very, very bad. The Plot can only be described as ridicolous! Moreover, the characters, even the ones we know and love, are acting overdrivenly and aren't nearly as funny as they were in the Episodes 1-3. Not only that, barely anything fits the term "" Ice Age"" in this movie except for the landscapes being covered in snow. I have rarely been this disappointed in a movié that much. I think it's time to stop making new movies in this franchise. They're really milking it dry by making movies like this. I advise any Ice Age Fan who loved the first 3 movies as much as I did not to watch this movie."
" Garbage.
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,1,"Just a rushed together movie that is the equivalent of pooping out rocks, doesn't sound fun? I guess pooping out jagged rocks isn't for you."
" Don't make sixth Ice Age movie!
",2020-08-17 00:00:00,1,"I love Ice Age. It's one of my favorite animated franchise of my childhood. I like first four Ice Age movies but in 2016 was released awful sequel called Collision Course. This sequel is worst. Sequel killed good franchise. Humor in this sequel is unfunny, boring and awful. Scrat in this movie is boring and unfunny. This sequel is a huge disappointment. Never waste your time on this garbage sequel. Better rewatch first or second Ice Age movie. And better watch masterpiece Woody episodes than it. And please, creators! Never make sixth Ice Age movie! Never!!!"
" Just end it
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,3,"I don't hate the Ice Age franchise but it is clearly past its due date. This film shows that there really isn't any more that the creators can add. Where else is there to go? What else is there to see? After fourteen years, I think it should just be laid to rest. It had a good run."
" Ice age collision course
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,5,"Now this franchise has assembled a huge family and everyone is here including weasel, and other, 4 elephants, 2 tigers, & Sid finds his bride.And the whole herd joins in the end."
" A bad film, anyone under 6 or 7 will probably hate it
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,2,"This film is a rubbish movie that should stay in the ice age and the series should end in case of this happening again
I liked 1, 2 and 3 but this was just bad."
" My childhood
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,10,"Though it is admitted that this movie shouldn't be a good ending of Ice Age series and I didn't give most movies of the series good scores in IMDB,I can still remember the time when I and my brothers went to watch this movie in the cinema -we relly had a great time at that time.But since we all have entered high schools and are bothered with heavy schoolwork,we seldom meet with each other and I really miss that experience.
So though this is not a very great movie,I still give it good scores because it carries my sweet memory and this is what a good and warm movie should bring us."
" Boring
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,4,"The fifth installment in the worst. This age of ""Ice Age"" needs to stop here."
" With a dumb plot, irritating and annoying characters, and the worst written humor imaginable, this franchise is creatively extinct
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,3,"Due to the successful box results of Continental Drift, Blue Sky made yet another film, Collision Course where Scrat's acorn sends an asteroid to earth and our main heroes must find a way to stop it with the help of their old friend.Given the fact that this film got even worse reviews than the previous films and made less money at the box office, this is my #1 worst Blue Sky Studios film. It's not like Secret of NIMH 2, but given this film's reputation, I don't see why Blue Sky should make any more films.Not only is the plot dumb, but it recycles the previous films (notably the 2nd and 4th films) where Scrat tries to get his acorn only to spread some chaos and the main characters try to survive the end of the world while encountering other characters along the way. There's nothing new to the story and the outcome is totally predictable. The writing is the worst. Not only does it lack character development, but the main characters that used to be likeable have lost their charm in this and the other side characters are irritating and annoying. Even the humor's juvenile (and the less said about that poop joke the better). The pacing is not very good to the point of being rushed.Now, there are some things that saved the film for me. The only characters that I tolerated in this were Scrat and Buck (who was by far the best character in the 3rd film) only because they had some funny bits here and there. The animation, while not in the same league as the previous films, is at least decent and John Debney provided a really good music score that used some bits of the previous films' musical scores (notably the 1st film and the 3rd film). Unfortunately, they've been wasted on such a bad sequel like this and that makes me feel so sad.The 1st film had maturity and balanced the comedy with the drama really well and while The Meltdown, Dawn of the Dinosaurs, and Continental Drift weren't without their problems, they were at least entertaining. This is just the lowest point of the franchise with neither of those qualities.Overall, little kids may like this film, but if you're a fan of the Ice Age franchise, give this one a skip because this deserves a thumbs down. :("
" Reviewing Ice Age: Collision Course
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,6,"Sienna's Rating: 6 Stars
Paul's Rating: 5 Stars
Seb's Rating: 6 StarsThe concluding episode, where's Scrat's buffoonery ends up destroying life on Mars! Is that supposed to be funny? Anyway, more period confusion, but some laughs with the old gang. The end of the series is signaled by Manny's daughter marrying and moving away: perhaps an allegory for children who have grown up over the decade + in which these movies have been produced."
" Overdone
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,5,"As with the original, an exciting and emotive film with a great comical feel and a variety of morals. However apart from being this sequel being well dubbed it is by far the most nonsensical and remisc. As with the forth, the story and comedy seem to lack any of the originality of the first and third films.An ok sequel but lacking."
" Review
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,1,Watching this is like going on an expensive trip to france while being put inside a glass cube. And being shown active car traffic. Don't watch.
" The little squirrel who is obsessed with tearing down the earth
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,7,"The story is very old-fashioned, but it still looks good. When the squirrel appears, it automatically turns on the happy mode. The origin of the universe is inexplicably burning. The brain circuit of the weasel can no longer be praised. There is also the alpaca that does yoga. A smile can't stop in five minutes. Even with regard to the science of gravity magnetic mineral volcanoes, I feel very nutritious. Although the plot is very simple and suitable for children, the intensive laughter is very suitable for relaxation! The family movie is very good! Animal hair is also made very real. Again, praise the imagination!"
" This is soo dull.
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,6,"This type of movie is money-grab. The story is so simple, dull and cheap. All you get watching this movie is beautiful animations. That's it. A disgrace to Ice Age franchise."
" Dodgy Final Course
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,3,"No wonder the kids are daft these days, if they watch this stuff. The original and first sequel were good, but its now going downhill, in fact its picked up speed and is about to crash at the bottom.Its turned from a cool comedy adventure into a daft romp through some fantasy made up world not having any similarity to life on earth.Daft goings on, daft voices, daft characters and daft songs, please don't make any more if they are like this. The bandwagon is full."
" The Worst Movie of the Entire Series
",2019-12-16 00:00:00,1,"Ice Age: Collision Course is a film that I thought was horrible and the worst of the Ice Age series.This time around, Scrat is yet again trying to bury his acorn. He comes across an abandoned UFO, and ends up launching himself into outer space, causing chaos and creating an asteroid to head towards Earth. Manny, Sid, Diego, and the rest of the herd find out about this when a meteor shower strikes and Buck the weasel comes back to give them info about what is going on. They now have to do anything that they can to stop this disaster from happening and save the day.Now, there are alot of major issues with this movie. First being the comedy. This movie was not funny at all. I didn't laugh at any scene in this movie at all. The stupid stuff that happens really kills the movie's humor, making it completely unfunny. Second, the plot. The plot seemed too identical to ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"", where a natural disaster that Scrat causes is happening, and the herd has to survive it. Not only that, but this movie stole the plot of ""Armageddon"", where an asteroid is about to hit Earth, and people have to figure out how to stop it. So, in other words, the plot is unoriginal. The posters for this movie also makes it look like a childish version of ""The Martian"".There are no redeeming qualities, in this movie.The animation and voice acting are okay at best. The film's animation looks fine, and the voice acting is fine coming from some really good actors. I really like how they got Adam Devine as the new character, Julian, to voice him.Speaking of new characters, that's another minus. Julian is a mammoth that is Peaches' fiancé, Brooke (voiced by Jessie J) is Sid's new girlfriend, and Shangri Llama (played by Jesse Tyler Ferguson) is a leader of a crystal palace.""Ice Age: Collision Course"" is the worst movie of the series, one of the worst animated movies I've ever seen, and one of the worst movies of 2016."
" A horrible sequel to the ICE AGE franchise
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,1,"I love, love, LOVE ICE AGE 1,2,3,4!!! But the 5th film was way off the map of story telling😡 they have ruined a perfectly good franchise with ""ICE AGE: Collusion Course"" (2016) the comedy in this film is horrible!! They tried way to hard on coming up with funny scenes. And scenes with Scrat was very disappointed and disturbing 🤢 I totally wished they ended on ""ICE AGE: Continental Drift"" (2012)"
" Stop making them
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,3,They run out of ideas so they created same plot as Ice Age 2 but this time it is not funny and it's pretty dull. I can only see little kids enjoying this and I am a big fan of second Ice Age movie.
" Mediocre film overstays it's welcome
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,4,Rating4/10Mediocre fifth installment in Ice Age series. Fast paced but nonsensical plot and mostly unfunny jokes makes this film overstay it's welcome.Mediocre
" The Worst Ice Age Movie
",2019-08-05 00:00:00,5,"This movie was the worst ice age movie by far.
Scrat was hilarious and the animation was good, But the storyline was very boring and it was not very funny for most of the movie. The other ice age movies are still amazing but this one almost ruined them for me."
" It's important always to know when the fun is over
",2019-06-16 00:00:00,2,"Surely the worst part of the saga (bet u all agree with me). You notice that they're running out of ideas. Nothing special: the topic was Not at all Creative namely very similar to that one in the former part. The same applies To the exaggeratedness of the plot's implementation. I also criticized that in the 4th part, but not to compare with this part. I mean the UFO with all these high-tech functions, this is definitely not something which belongs to the glacial age. Somehow, they also lost their sense of humor. Compare it with the other parts. Not at all funny anymore, just only childish. They should have bring this to an end when it was at its best. Entirely unnecessary and trust me, u really didn't miss anything if u haven't seen it."
" Tolerable at Best.
",2019-05-17 00:00:00,7,"Ice Age: Collision Course is a film that I happen to not mind, but it is the weakest of the Ice Age series.This time around, Scrat is yet again trying to bury his acorn.

Manny, Sid, Diego, and the rest of the herd find out about this when a meteor shower strikes and Buck the weasel comes back to give them info about what is going on. They now have to do anything that they can to stop this disaster from happening and save the day.Now, there are two big problems with this movie. The first being the comedy. It's half funny, half stupid. The stupid stuff that happens can really kill the movie's humor, making it almost unfunny. Second, the plot. The plot seemed too identical to Ice Age: Continental Drift, where a natural disaster that Scrat causes is happening, and the herd has to survive it. Not only that, but this movie stole the plot of Armageddon, where an asteroid is about to hit Earth, and people have to figure out how to stop it. So, in other words, the plot is unoriginal.There are some redeeming qualities, though. Like I said, the comedy is half funny. The funny stuff does work, and most of it, of course, comes from the Scrat segments, as well as some moments with the herd.Once again, the animation and voice acting are really really good. The film's animation is nice, bright, and shiny, and the voice acting is solid coming from some really good actors. I really like how they got Adam Devine as the new character, Julian, to voice him. Devine is one of my favorite comedians, and he did a pretty funny job.Speaking of new characters, that's another plus. Julian is a mammoth that is Peaches' fiancé, Brooke (voiced by Jessie J) is Sid's new girlfriend, and Shangri Llama (played by Jesse Tyler Ferguson) is a leader of a crystal palace.All in all, Ice Age: Collision Course is my least favorite of the 5, but it can still be watchable at best. Could've been slightly better, but I've seen worse."
" Better than the fourth but will never be as good as the original.
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,6,"They need to stop making ice age movies, they are killing it (in a bad way) but I do have to admit I do still like the animation and I am glad buck is in this because he is the best part."
" The cringe is real. Why do they abuse the series like this?

" Worse than stupid
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,4,"Somehow being silly and mindless wasn't low enough for this film. We are hit with crass, gross and disturbing, all while your intelligence is dragged through the gutter. Seriously, do not let your kids or friends with weak minds watch this..."
" The whole film is trying to be funny, but the effect is poor.
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,5,"The opening of the brain is too big to keep up with. The whole film is trying to be funny, but the effect is poor."
" Still funny
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,7,"As much as there is a tendency in humans to want to denigrate sequels, this Ice Age sequel still has the Ice Age magic. Sure, it's nowhere near the level of the first movie, but after I watched one of the new Jurassic Park movies just before this one, the air sat heavy on my chest, as that air was filled with mindless artistically bankrupt Hollywood action, and along came Ice Age Collision Course and cleared everything right up. What a delight it was to watch.The story is kind of dumb and a lot of the dialogue is dumb and the whole thing feels like an episode of a sitcom, but the scene progression still works, the animation is sharp and many of the slapstick jokes still hit their mark. It is also well-acted and just...cheerful, you know? Just...not trying to be Hamlet or a cynical blockbuster, but simply a lowbrow cheerful experience."
" Why can't we fear the apocalypse like normal families?
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,7,"""Collision Course"" may be an attempt to milk a dying cow, there are no really hilarious moments and it is a bit over-the-top, but it is not nearly as bad as its reputation and ratings on film sites suggest. It holds attention from beginning to end, has a decent plot and well-known and beloved characters are here again to make us emotional and cheer us up. The quality of the franchise has definitely declined, but it's still good, and I honestly enjoyed this movie.7/10"
" Garbage as hell
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,1,"Where did this nonsense come from? How did this franchise go from being one of honest emotion to one of the characters practising downward dogs?Enough is enough! To the garbage bin with all these useless, insufferable film devices:1. Overload of unnecessary characters.2. Idiotic pop culture references.3. Exploitation of celebrity talent.4. Borrowing plot devices from decent films.5. Sitcom plots and alternate plot cliches.6. Fast pacing.No more of this nonsense, Blue Sky! This should be a box office BOMB! If you make a sixth film this should be one at least be a disappointment financially."

The introduction was brief, yet varied, and provided enough intrigue to entice viewers into the plot. The storyline was educational in parts, a great feature for a family movie.TensionThe tension building effects were professional, with comedy implemented to finish. Music was utilised for dramatic effect to assist this. Additionally, lighting effects within mist created an aura of mystery at such moments. Switching camera focus and angles in variable locations, was also done well, providing a truly visual spectacle.CharactersBuck featured again, much the same as in ""Dawn of the dinosaurs"". Other characters included Sid and his grandma. Plenty of new characters also featured, most with distinct, and often conflicting, personalities. The characters here, were as diverse as they've been in the prequels. Whilst certain characters appeared to follow like sheep, others really embodied their personality. They often provided believable, yet funny reactions. Fortunately, none were totally predictable, keeping the plot entertaining, and fresh. Combining tension, with comedy, was particularly good in this movie. This was possibly it's main USP.Variation in character viewpoints was well exploited, with plenty of sitcom moments. These were each highly amusing, shown by my lack of ""deaf ears"" , to any of the jokes posed.Character colours were highly diverse, and used well to brighten up the settings.SummaryA delightfully humorous edition, of a great family adventure. A little predictable, but not in it's comedy or characters.Product :see my blog: Reasonedandseasonedblog dot Wordpress dot com"
" Awesome! Also, a way to help Ice Age get better
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,10,"The movie was very great! I enjoyed it because it was very funny and the animation ROCKED! But it is sad the Ice Age went down because of the overwhelming negative reception, the angry reviews, and the box office bomb. If the sequel gets cancelled, I will be very sad, because Ice Age is a great franchise and I know how Ice Age 6 could get better.This is my idea, they could return originals, even the baby we know Roshan, but as a teen or young adult, and he could have a family. Even we can return some original villains like Zeke and the Evil Sabers from the first film, but they work with Captain Gutt and the Pirates! That could improve the franchise and return some big money to Blue Sky! Also, Diego and Shira could have CUBS, cause that would be cute.I hope Blue Sky Studios reads this, It could give them an idea for Ice Age 6."
" just a thing to add
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,8,"Even when the movie it's great as usual, you could say that had some important lack of "" story""... clever idea the end of the world..? hmnnn.. and Please Llamas have not horns!!!! come on!!!...otherwise good moment of fun."
" Time to end the franchise.
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,1,"Completely and utterly stupid. This is definitely not for a mature audience. Its time to go back to the drawing board, or even better yet, kill the franchise. There really is nothing more to tell. Even my favorite Scrat was not funny."
" Losing steam
",2018-05-23 00:00:00,7,"Acorn-loving rodent Scrat inadvertently puts a comet on a collision course with Earth (don't ask!), following which our mismatched mammals have a world to save. And, all the while, dad Manny is having to deal with daughter Peaches' plans to go travelling with idiot boyfriend Julian. Assuming mammoths have boyfriends, of course.The fifth entry in the Ice Age saga once again finds a potentially earth-shattering disaster sharing centre stage with the soapy shenanigans of the main cast (as well as Peaches and Julian causing Manny heartache, Sid the Sloth actually has sufficient love-life for it to be causing him problems).The impending cometary collision is caused by Scrat pursuing acorns onto a flying saucer, frozen in ice, and then inadvertently piloting it into orbital disaster (fortunately, all the planetary bodies in the solar system are within about a hundred yards of each other, but it's a bit foolish of me to sarcastically make this point about a film featuring a cast of friendly talking mammoths, sloths, and sabre-tooth tigers). Scrat's stuff is, as always, comical knockabout humour and, for me, it was the best part of the film.The disaster plot fell a bit flat, as did Manny's concerns - these elements felt like little more than revisiting the difficulties in Continental Drift, and set me to wondering if these characters have now reached the end of their shelf life. They are pleasant enough company, but do they need to break new ground and, if so, how?Something else which seemed problematic to me was the CGI. The original character designs, of necessity, were blocky and relatively low on detail (CGI has moved on a lot in 14 years), and I've got used to CGI movies looking a great deal slicker than Ice Age 5 - which needs to share an aesthetic with its predecessors - does. Oh, it has moved on, but it has a tricky line to tread.The voice cast does fine, as always, and I suspect that this will sit happily in a 5-movie set but, to me, it felt as if this series has reached the end of the road."
" Suprised this hasn't made the franchise extinct
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,3,"I can't believe Blue Sky produced both The Peanuts Movie- their best film, in my opinion and this- easily their worst within a period of nine months A list of some of its most blatant problems are below:The new characters. Julien was in absolutely none of the previous installments but now he's Peaches's (who, by the way, was a newborn calf just two movies ago) finace? And the romance between Sid and Brooke is incredibly forced with no chemistry between them. At least Shiego had some private moments together in the fourth movie for them to develop feelings! Here Brooke just asks Sid to be her ""mate for life"" (why didn't she just ask to marry him? We see at the end that animals do that in this universe?!) and after she gets young again (don't ask) it's happily ever after.The general level of anthropomorphism they give these animals, which results in a ton of extremely nonsensical pop cultural references. The words ""profile picture"" and ""hashtag"" are stated during what has to be tens of thousands of years in the price. Not exactly a PC reference but another example of a poor line of dialog comes near the end when Sid asks Brooke if she's 'tried the shrimp"" at a HERBIVORE'S...WEDDING. Yeah. Like I said earlier, according to this movie, WILD animals apparently got legally wed during the PLEISTOCENE. Also, a plot point Of Diego and Shira, who are apex predators, not wanting kids to fear them, makes little sense.Anything to do with Scrat here. The sequences of him getting crushed while in the spaceship get pretty disturbing (at one point his flesh and fur fall off his skeleton, for example). But nothing can compare to the fact that he DESTROYS ALL LIFE ON MARS at the end of the movie. More than deserved to get smashed by those doors in the mid-credits scene.The fact that this movie still feels the need to throe in the dino-birds as the bad guys when there-s already an antagonist force via the incoming asteroid (or rather, via the squirrel who caused to to head for earth).So yeah, instead of this, put on just about any other film from this animation studio, be it the other Ice Age movies, the Rio movies, Ferdinand, anything. But this is still better than Leo the Lion, Foodfight!, Norm of The North, or The Emoji Movie."
" Awesome best movie of the fanshise
",2018-05-06 00:00:00,9,"This is the best ice age movie i love this movie i dont understand the hate but atleast i like this movie my favorite part was when scrat goes to space that was so funny,i hope they make ice age 6 and this movie is so funny"
" Still not a bad movie, but the worst of the series *A few spoilers!*
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,5,"Ok, I have to give credit to the animation in this movie. It's amazing as all the Ice Ages, but the charecters and the story were bad. First of all, the twins have dirty humor at some times, Buck treats a pumpkin like its own kid, Julien(Peache's boyfriend) was pretty boring and annoying, Sid was just as annoying as Julien, Diego wasn't bad but a little harsh sometimes on Manny, Manny was my favorite. he was funny at sometimes. The worst of them all was Sid's grandmother. She was just so unoriginal and rude sometimes.It's still not a bad movie, but just has some rude, dirty humor at some points at the movie."
" Could have been better if tried
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,1,"This sequel is the worst.. Degrading day by day.. not only children watch animated movies but also adults. So please don't ignore us, use some brain to make next one interesting with a good storyline.."
" Pythagoras-He has the right angle
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,5,"Our same fun characters are out to save the world from a meteor. The film pays homage to ""2001..."" and Moses. The kids still love it.

" They tried too hard to make it funny...
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,5,"With every single minute of the first 30 minutes being one prat fall after another, this one showed me it was not going to be very good...To make it even worse, the CGI was way too bright, and just didn't project the same color as the originals...it felt fake, period...while it had 3D depth, otherwise it wasn't impressive...I'm having a tough time continuing on with this review, it isn't bad per se'...but in no way does it have the same magic we have grown to expect from Ice Age..."
" Why so much hate?!
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,9,This movie is HILARIOUSLY funny. I'm not sure why it has such bad reviews. My only complaint is that the antagonists barely got ANY screen time. I'm just glad they had development! :). Granny is defiantly the best part of this movie. She has so many great one liners. Really hoping for a 6th Ice Age movie!!!!

And that is not only because the technology has gotten much better since the first ""Ice Age"" movie from 2002, but also because of the storyline and the comedy.I sat down with my seven year old son to watch ""Ice Age: Collision Course"" and I think we ended up being equally entertained and amused with this 2016 addition to the ""Ice Age"" franchise. Personally, I sat down to watch this because of Scrat, as he is just hilarious, despite him only being a supporting character.The story in ""Ice Age: Collision Course"" starts out with Scrat accidentally managing to trigger a cosmic event that comes to threaten Earth in his constant quest to acquire his precious acorn. With doom fast approaching it is up to the ragtag group of friends to come together with a plan how to save everything they love and hold dear.The animation style and art style is just lovable, as it has been in all of the ""Ice Age"" movies. But of course this becomes improved with each movie as the technology becomes better. And the level of detail and finesse the animators manage to come up with never cease to amaze me. It is visually stunning to sit through ""Ice Age: Collision Course"", no doubt about it.And it is also always a treat when they get the same voice actors and actresses to return to revisit their characters, as it gives a good continuation to the characters and you easily reconnect with the characters from that recognition of a familiar voice.As for the voice acting, then they really managed to get an all-star ensemble of voice acting performers together for this movie. And aside from Scrat, whom is relatively unvoiced, then my favorite is Denis Leary as he puts a voice to Diego.""Ice Age: Collision Course"" is filled with lots of laughs and really funny situations that are so nicely animated and brought to life on the screen. And it is especially great because they continue on with the type of comedy established in the first movie and seen throughout the entire franchise, but also manages to add something new to each movie.If you enjoyed the previous ""Ice Age"" movies, then you definitely do not want to miss out on ""Ice Age: Collision Course""."
" What a waste!
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,3,"Some animated movies cry out for sequels...'Finding Nemo', 'Toy Story', even 'Shrek' are but a few. But 'Ice Age', now with its FOURTH sequel, is definitely not one of them!The premise is moronic, even for a children's movie. Scrat, looking for someplace to bury his acorn, activates an abandoned alien ship that launches asteroids destined to collide with Earth. At the same time, Manny is worried about his daughter Peaches upcoming wedding, Sid is dumped by his girlfriend Francine, and Diego and Shira want to start a family - but are afraid their appearance might be too scary for kids. And there are several other ridiculous plots going on at the same that do nothing but confuse little viewers.Although I loved the original ""Ice Age"", and even the first sequel or two, this fifth submission was obviously made just to exploit a few more bucks out of movie go-ers pockets. Note to studio: NO NUMBER SIX!!!"
" The Worst Ice Age Film In the Franchise
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,3,"Now I like the first Ice Age and I considered It one of the great animated classics, when the sequels came In and I know this may sound predicable but they are not as good as the original, however they are fine as they are, they are not the worst, but fun to watch. However!, with this one, THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST IN THE FRANCHISE!, the story is stupid and lazy, the characters are unfunny, pointless and really dumb, the jokes are so juvenile and unfitting.The only really good things about this movie is the animation looks fantastic, Scrat's still really funny, I'm so happy that Buck has returned and Is still being the funny Weasel he is and Brooke and the Dino-Birds are kind of.. tolerable I guess, but It don't matter because the film is just... UNNECESSARY!!!.Please don't watch this film, this is the one that made Ice Age a cash crabbing franchise and like Family Guy and the Simpsons, It now has run out of ideas, I wouldn't blame It on Blue-Sky, It's all Fox's fault!.And yes you can guess I'm giving this a 3/10."
" brightly colored non-sense
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,3,"Scrat's hunt for the acorn leads him into a spaceship buried in the ice. He accidentally flies into space and sets asteroids on a collision course with earth. Back on the ground, Peaches and Julian want to get married. It's Manny and Ellie's anniversary when some of the asteroids start crashing onto the ground. Buck the weasel explains a prophecy set in stone about an asteroid destroying the world. The gang sets off to stop the forewarn catastrophe opposed by a family of dino-birds.The Ice Age franchise has always played fast and loose with facts and reality. This goes way too far and makes less sense than anything from before. It is sound and fury signifying nothing. The story rambles on and on. The squirrel is still the funniest part of the movie. If they want to go into space, why not have aliens take the whole gang and have some fun with that. This is a lot of unfunny non-sense. It's only saving grace may be its brightly-colored wackiness which may delight the youngest crowd. The story is too much of a mess for anybody with a developed brain."
" Tipping/melting ice point
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,5,"We're near a point now, where I do wonder what else they can come up with? Where else are they going to send our group of misfits. And how long was the Ice Age exactly? Shouldn't it be over by now? Still it's always great to see our favorite squirrel (Scrat) and his never-ending quest - I know, Nuts, right? I couldn't resist, sorry.Apart from obvious jokes, family issues (how to deal with your daughter and all that drama), we have another journey ahead of us. While it is entertaining enough to watch, there is a point where it feels like we've been here before. Not literally, but just in the sense of peril and how our heroes are going about to solve their problems and everyone else too. Still for kids it's enough to keep them occupied"
" It's clear that the franchise is done
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,2,"Yes, you read the title correctly. A fifth entry into the series which began in 2002 with Ice Age somehow stumbled onto cinema screens last year to find that even the target audience may have become fatigued by the increasingly cuddly and decreasingly funny franchise, as its box office pulled in far fewer dollars than was expected. You would be forgiven if you weren't even aware of this movie, as I doubt even the most loyal of fans were screaming out for more following the limp Continental Drift in 2012. Having covered just about every historical disaster to hit the globe without any sense of timeline, writers Michael J. Wilson, Michael Berg and Yoni Brenner have decided to make one up, and that is after sending one of its most recognisable characters into space.That character is Scrat, the saber-tooth squirrel whose neverending quest to get his hands on that evasive acorn always proved to be a welcome distraction whenever the central story became too tedious or sentimental. After stumbling upon an alien spaceship glimpsed in the first movie, he accidentally switches it on and is blasted into the cosmos, playing pinball with the planets and forming the Milky Way. Before you can say ""hey, that doesn't make any sense!"", Scrat sends a meteorite hurtling towards Earth, just as Manny the mammoth (Ray Romano) realises he has forgotten his anniversary while stressing about his grown-up daughter's relationship with the goofy Julian (Adam Devine). Collision Course is happy to meander along like a prehistoric sitcom.It's quite clear that directors Mike Thurmeier and Galen T. Chu are convinced that by simply throwing more characters into this already overstuffed universe will distract the audience from the sheer lack of imagination and actual jokes. Returning are Ellie (Queen Latifah), Manny's wife; ground sloth Sid (John Leguizamo) who is feeling lovelorn after being dumped; saber-tooth tiger Diego (Denis Leary), who seems to be teaching his girlfriend Shira (Jennifer Lopez) that eating meat is bad; opossum brothers and comic-relief Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck); and wise-cracking screwball Granny (Wanda Sykes). As the meteor heads closer to Earth, the Herd come across Buck (Simon Pegg), the unhinged weasel still living in the secret Jurassic world last seen in Dawn of the Dinosaurs, who inadvertently invites a trio of p****d-off dromaeosaurs (voiced by Nick Offerman, Stephanie Beatiz and Max Greenfield) onto their trail. It's all too much - Lopez must have about 5 lines throughout the entire film - and I'm not even covering the new set of characters introduced near the end.There's plenty of forward momentum and what must be a world-record of fart and a**e gags to distract unfussy children, but there is next to nothing to keep the grown-up audience entertained. In an age where The Lego Movie can make profound statements about the nature of corporate culture and Zootopia can ask some serious questions about race relations, you would find deeper life-lessons in an episode of The King of Queens than you will find in Collision Course. Demonstrating an understanding of the laws of physics on par with Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, the education here is purely familial, with Manny undergoing the same learning curve as he has in every previous instalment. While the animation may be lovely and polished, the sheer lack of effort by Blue Sky Studios to deliver anything but a piece of colourful fluff to keep the cash machine fully stocked and operational is unforgivable. When you find yourself rooting for the asteroid to end of this nonsense once and for all, it's clear that the franchise is done."
" Time to put this franchise on ice forever!
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,1,"Original is not a word that comes to mind when watching the fifth (yes FIFTH) entry in this tired, worn, quite frankly burned out franchise.What does come to mind however is the fact this franchise has gone on for far too long.If you can't come up with any original ideas and you have to scrap the deepest barrel for the most unoriginal idea as possible, it's time to go.If you can't keep your characters fresh and funny and make them more boring, dull and annoying to watch, it's time to go.If you're out of jokes to use and you pull some random rabbit out of a hat and it's a rabbit that says ""Think of some really bad jokes mate."", it's time to go.If you have 4 (yes, I do mean 4) writers and not one of them can give any good dialogue out, it's time to go.And when a franchise that is constantly dead in the water is still going like THIS, it's time to go.I don't care if these films still make money, Fox, it's time to put this franchise on ice forever!"
