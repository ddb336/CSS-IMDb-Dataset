" A diamond
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,10,"Perhaps you will find that in the beginning the movie has so fast dialogues. And it continues through out all of the movie. So if you are foreigner (like me ) you will find difficult to catch all from the subtitles and perhaps you will say not worth to see. But if you insist, sooner or later you will start to understand the beauty of the movie. It needs to see at least one more time to start seeing all the surrounding that you missed first time by looking at the subtitles. The characters are so good in their roles! The photography unbelievable! you will enjoy seeing it again the next day. I had years to see a such moving movie."

" Dont go Somayye!
",2019-06-07 00:00:00,9,"A complete drum and, in all sense, one of the best Iranian films, thanks to the dear Saeed Rustayi for making a good and lasting effect, forever and one day, a flip. It's a lie to remind us of a forgotten class. The buried class is under the rubbish of misery and poverty, and of addiction and dangers, and ....... But the most controversial and, most of all, the most golden, The dialogue is the one where Morteza said loudly to everyone: ""Anyone can, and there is no shortage of lesser dogs, every time they go and get back from the dog less, less."" This dialogue is tapped in the face of the audience."
" Best
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,10,I highly recommend this!. As much as you can you should watch this.
" completely engrossing & captivating
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,10,"'We all die one day, don't worry, no one has ever been left alive"". Life + 1 day is about dysfunctional, shattered family who are overwhelmed by fear as the youngest daughter of the family is getting married. The characters come to life through the dialogue, confrontations, and realistic situations. The acting was very raw and impressive. This heart-wrenching drama is a must see."
" Alireza.akhlaghi.official
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,10,"We did not experience. We only appeared as a viewer.
It was not necessary to be same like that because it was perceptible and tangible for almost every kind of audience.
It's as if somewhere near us is happening or has already happened.
We laughed, we cried and judged, as a viewer. Anger effect was certain.
When the film came to an end, need for free space and review step by step of the movie, complete a significant movie effect.
As for the characters in the story, it's enough that the audience finally concludes that, despite the apparent faults of the characters, no one is to blame and all the faults should be left to fate.
All characters are a function of the conditions.
But I think that, beyond these reactions, the demand for the film was something else.
The film asked us to make an identification instead of judging.
Asked us to understand what the dangers of the crowded family are struggling with poverty.
The film asked us to hear the words of Mohsen (Navid Mohammadzadeh), despite the fact that audience translated he is an abnormal obscurity brutish in the first place.
But
Pain of not understand. A misunderstanding of past generations that portrays itself in the form of a crowded family, to show abnormalities that the family faces today, and to portray itself as a extremist, conservative, and fearless personality.
Laughter sequences from the bottom and crying from the bottom in the cinema had a confusing atmosphere that showed real effect.
The film's cinematic experience was specific to one of the spectators in the last quarter continued with a cigarette.
Others were melting in a way that someone did not attention to an angry viewer and his cigarette's bad smell.
at the end:
Our cinema really needs such as this films. Films that really push audiences dumb or into a deep inside challanging and push into judging and not doing space."
" sensational and fast, a lot more valuable than one time watching
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,10,"this film is the first time Saeed Roostaee made his long movie, considering that,this could be a pleasing accident to the Iranian's cinema. making fast, quick but effective rhythms which fits exactly right in the action of switching between dark and hopeful themes of the camera , with nice Decoupaged Miseenscenes turned this dark drama even more comfortable and attractive to watch. considerable act of Parinaz Izadyar as the character of Somayeh, transfers the true concept of her role on the scenario as the second mother of the family, the origin of kindness which brings hope to a poor family and balances the tragic power of film by proposing a solution to the major disappointing scenes , armed with every kind of art to brings his theory to the every edge of director's frame. so if you have some time and you're ready to feel some impressing drama , here you are."
" The story of 6 brothers and sisters, all struggling in their own ways...
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,8,"The acting is just fabulous - I especially loved Payman Moadi, Navid Mohammadzadeh, and Parinaz Izadyar. But I have to say the story was a little too dark for my taste! Towards the end of the movie, I just wanted to bang my head into the wall! And that's why I give it 8 stars. But all in all, wow, just wow!"
" Best movie after a long time in Iran
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,10,"""Life and a day"" is a recurring story heard that repeatedly by other filmmaker's sense making a feature film. The story of a low level family, which is located with the arrival of a suitor and the surrounding issues that this does happen, the spectator's Guide to the dark world of this family and their lives against the audience's eyes. But the major difference is ""forever and a day"" with other works that have been made, however, and the atmosphere that this is a good story and characters to Director that story it is known to occur.

The shooting script and the script to the character, much pay and standard size. Fortunately the Director well understand that this narrative is the story of guys no white and black city down them. These people have a common pain, but never to reach their goals is a scary Monster. Other controversial features acclaimed movies can be found in the character of the child searched for personality; that unlike the dark space and dark story, quite a gifted filmmaker and with it gives this message to the community that the clever people belonging To handle a specific class or do not have the best community of personification of the movie belongs to Mohsen (played by Navid Mohammad Zadeh).The young man junkie that, although intense addiction to a drug dealer, and a history of capitalism, but his love to remind family members of the haunted and among the fights with his brother, Morteza (Treaty of Maadi) Always remind him that should not marry such a situation with somayeh. Sexy brother and sister m. and somayeh especially in the final third of the film is a brilliant sequence Mohsen are conjure somayeh, spectacular and influential and is directed by a well detailed also said rural from this position Becker, has created a lasting moment.One of the best features of ""forever and a day"" can be used to depict the problem of addiction. A problem that in recent years over and over again in the cinema of the talk but never has so much for tangible and understandable lack of audience e. Young film director instead of portraying a stereotypical situations of the individual, the person addicted introduces the problem that causes the addiction away from her family gathering.

" A superb depiction of poverty, family unity and struggle in modern-day Iran
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,10,"First-Time director Saeid Roustayi captures Iranian culture, the current poverty epidemic that everyday Iranians face from a realistic standpoint. The performances, story and cinematography all allow us a realistic glimpse into this family, whose dealing with many issues. The film touches on a lot of Iranian taboos and cultural fallbacks on a surface level, and delves deep into others. The family business is struggling, one brother is addicted (solid performance from Navid Mohammadzadeh), another sister doesn't marry (big deal in iranian culture), one is divorced, and another plans to be married off to supposedly wealthy Afghan. The main character, portrayed brilliantly by Peyman Moaadi struggles to make wise business and family decisions, and it becomes taxing. For fans of Iran's realist movement should watch this. I felt like this accurately captured Iranian culture, while also posing vital questions about the situations."
" I highly recommend this movie to everyone who like to see how an impoverished life can be in the Capital of Iran.
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,10,"this review may contain spoilers so be careful... I highly recommend this movie to everyone who like to see how an impoverished life can be in the Capital of Iran. In a world that we all like to see the glory, this movie shows us that there is another side. A side in which you are destined to fight, in a world that you have to stand on your feet. this movie is not a story of love but a story of persons who never found and could find love because of poverty, girls that were beautiful but no one sought them because their family was so poor. Boys who had become addicted because of pain and couldn't get rid of their addiction even when they were trampled under the strains of insults. yes this the story of poverty. this a story of a little smart boy whose only hope within its struggling family is his all-embracing and kind sister who he might lose."
