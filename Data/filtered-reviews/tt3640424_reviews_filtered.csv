" Boring and pointless.
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,4,"Not a great love movie, not a great war movie. A bit of a waste of my time. Unless you have a crush on Pitt or Marion, as I am sure many do, don't waste your time with this one."
" The plot manages to remain credible throughout, and avoids any blatant artifice or tired tropes to induce a heart racing finale. Solid Stuff.
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,5,"Assigned behind enemy lines to assassinate a wanted target, a Canadian Intelligence Officer is forced to take a circuitous route to his rendezvous. His parachute descends over Northern Africa, French Morocco, and he makes a hard landing on a sand dune in the dessert. It's 1942. World War 2 is raging, and he has yet to meet his partner for the mission, a Female French Resistance Fighter. As he walks along the nearest road, an aproaching dust cloud rises from the horizon, indicating an oncoming vehicle. As he reaches for his gun belt, he does not know if the driver is friend or foe. As espionage war dramas go, this one is fairly decent. Though the pace can feel a bit slow occasionally, on the whole, the show rattles along quite nicely. The plot manages to remain credible throughout, and avoids any blatant artifice or tired tropes to induce a heart racing finale. Solid Stuff."

" I recommend it to drama lovers
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,9,I cried a lot!)) And really felt the atmosphere.This movie is inspiring and made me feel that a real love exist.
" A stunning visual of the period war drama based in similar real fact!!
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,8,"I've read several reviews some giving 3-2 even incredible 1 out 10, reputably given by many IMDB's members with a have deranged mind quite sure, such lowest degree just is aimed by really bad productions only, thus paradoxical and ignoble, it doesn't stands for the truth, back on picture the roots coming from a true facts on WW2, however with the girl was summarily dead by his husband, Steven Knight offers to Robert Zemeckis that was hooked by the fantastic script.The skillful director never walked in period picture over WW2, thereafter he has ventures of body and soul to make his best, the plot concerning in a gutsy Canadian spy soldier Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) sent to a dicey task in Casablanca, he ends up falling in love for beauty female spy of French Resistance Marianne Beauséjour (Marion Cotillard) afterwards a successful assignment Vatan asking to British intelligence enables a marriage with the fearless French Marianne to living in London, after an extensive fact-check she was admitted to live there, the couple had a baby Anne, later the cell of counter espionage acknowledges that real Marianne was death on France ground, thereby Vatan's wife is actually a German spy.Zemeckis deployed an stunning visual on lavish sound stages sets, patently impressive in smallest details, the photography was another highlight, apart the leading casting, we ought point out the ravishing acting of Jared Harris as Frank Heslop, the movie orbits in these three main characters, all remainders were just outlying, this war drama hovers in the air why Marianne make suck awful thing if she really loves his husband, she tells the enemy could hurt her little child Anne, the feeble excuse doesn't make sense at all.

" A Romantic WW II Spy movie
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,10,"I think this movie is a very underrated one ! It might not be a great spy thriller but a real drama of lovers and family ... Marion Cotillard plays brilliantl her character and with Brad Pitt they create a great chemistry . I think the dialogue and looks between Pitt and Cotillard during the house party , with Sing Sing Sing in the background , is an amazing scene to watch"
" A film you will remember
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,8,"I'm not a massive fan of war style films, but this was hugely enjoyable. I even brought it on DVD."
" Very basic
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,5,"An old school spy story, riddled with cliché and very basic overall.
Costumes and settings are amazing but it's definitely not a masterpiece.
Poor August Diehl was casted again as a Walmart Hellstrom."
" Find another hobby
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,1,"Even in a lockdown, even if you love film, take up another hobby like Sudoku,or basket weaving, or geneaology - anything to engage you for 2 hours rather than watch this rubbish,A storyline that did show promise unravelled into farce. Brad Pitt was wooden throughout. I wasn't surprised at the denouement - everybody involved must have been hoping for the end and their flight home."
" Love in dangerous time
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,8,And in dangerous situations. The story is a bit over the top with events hard to believe but lots was hard to believe then. This movie feels like a chess game where all the moves are important for life and for love. Good thriller.
" Love the Concept-the Movie not so Much
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,5,"Personally, I love the old WW type movies with spies and espionage et al. So this was right up my alley. But one fatal flaw in this whole movie brought it down, really fast. The insert of Hollywood's 'politically correct' gay couple. WHY? Why do they insist on doing that? In the WWII era let alone the military, it NEVER would have been allowed much less displayed at a bar, among officers? A seemingly small detail but yes, it began the ruin of the authenticity of the movie. From there every detail became suspect and I started 'judging' instead of enjoying. A word of advice to writers/producers...just knock it off. Stay true to the time you're filming about. Your audience KNOWS."
" Hidden gem
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,8,"I expected the gory details of the war, but was moved with the romantic story revolving around the spies. Couldn't get any better. The complete package having the best director and cast and not forgetting the great Steven Knight, creator of Peaky Blinders.
Worth the watch!"
" Disappointing movie trailer
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,5,"Great movie and actors performance was amazing, however I went for 5/10 as per that bad trailer which contains spoilersMaybe I was unlucky to see the trailer before watching the movie"

" A Mature Wartime Drama that Marketing spoiled
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,10,"There are some Robert Zemeckis movies that really shouldn't be spoiled before watching them. Cast Away and What Lies Beneath were a couple, and it's safe to add Allied to that list. Yet the trailers for all of them simply gave everything away. That's a conscious decision on the part of Zemeckis and the marketing teams in order to try and sell the movie to a broad audience and attract them, I get it, but there are surprises and turns to these movies that would be better enjoyed cold. A lot of that has to do with the talent and narrative investment that Zemeckis brings to every film, creating stories that strive to stand apart from the pack with depth and ingenuity.I love Allied, having seen it twice, considering it one of Zemeckis' most underappreciated works, but gosh darn it, would it have killed him to not reveal that Marion Cotillard was suspected of being a German spy in the trailer? There is only the barest of hints of such a possibility in the first hour of the film, the sorts of little details that only those who are rewatching the film or those on the keen lookout for any detail that goes against the grain would pick up on to indicate that such a possibility exists. Without that kind of outlook, those details could pass by in the opening in Casablanca with nary a notice and the reveal in the second act that drives the second half of the film could sit as a purer surprise.Anyway, Canadian flight officer and spy Max gets dropped into French Morocco where he is to play the part of husband to the French spy Marianne. They instantly fall into their parts but without ever forgetting that they are playing parts. There's a tension about any potential emotional connection between them and their work brought on by the idea that people in their profession don't mess up because they have sex but because they feel, and yet they're both attractive people in a dangerous profession where any day could be their last. Their mission is to kill the German ambassador to French Morocco and hopefully escape with their lives. In a tense and well-made scene, they do just that, but the feelings have erupted between them and they can't deny it. After a three week background check that keeps Marianne out of England in the middle of the war, she gets her approval to move to England for the wedding. Together in wartime London, they begin a family with Max riding a desk instead of out in the field.Up until this point, the movie has been a solid telling of a wartime romance with underpinnings of intrigue, but it's at the halfway point with the reveal that Marianne could be a German spy that things really turn. It's here that things begin to feel more like a traditional Zemeckis film with Max gaining a very specific goal, proving Marianne's innocence, that drives his every action through to the end. V-Section, Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, may be all but convinced of Marianne's guilt through a few scraps of information including the assertion that the real Marianne died in Paris several years earlier to the point that they set up a blue dye operation that Max must participate in and complete with Marianne's execution if she's guilty, but Max isn't going to just wait around for the results. He asks questions of those who might know, finding dead ends, he asks a young pilot to get an answer from a Frenchman only to have the young pilot killed because he waits too long after dropping off his payload for the resistance. Max even goes so far as to take that same flight himself to get the answer from the Frenchman in a wonderfully tense scene set at night.What ends up making this movie work so well is that second half. There's enough doubt about Marianne's loyalties considering things she had said to Max in the past and the pieces of information dolled out by V-Section and the Frenchman as well as some small things that Max sees himself that a tension brews about whether Max will be right or not in his assertion that Marianne is free from guilt. I think this may point to some of the critical complaints about the movie. Going in with the trailers in one's mind, you know that Marianne is going to be suspected, so you spend the first half waiting for it to get revealed and the second half finally feeling like the movie is catching up with the audience. This mindset seems to undermine the efficacy of everything that happens in the film for some, but I've never felt like marketing should affect my opinion of a film itself. I try to treat the opening frames of the movie like the first thing I've seen of the film.Allied is the work of a very skilled technical director working from an intelligent and tense script by Steven Knight. Paced steadily with an eye towards character and intrigue, the film is a quality addition to a strong filmography."
" Disappointed
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,3,"Had no preconception and watched for the first time (Nov 2020). The story seemed to be written by Anna to smooth over her parents' shame/scandal. I was looking for confirmation when I landed here. Plot was slow and without a sense of danger in beginning and never picked up even when it was expected. Pitt, whom I usually enjoy, was lifeless, and there was no chemistry with Ms Cotillard who did fairly well otherwise. There were some good/believable fx, but the juggling of languages was difficult to hear. One tense scene was the enemy bomber that looked as though it would crash on top of their house."
" My review
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,10,One of the best movie and very emotional at the last.
" Up with the best
",2020-11-03 00:00:00,9,"Some reviewers seem to aspire to be film critics of the New York Times and, at length, dissect the character development, cinematography, editing, plot weaknesses etc etc. We mere mortals want a good story that we can enjoy for two hours or so. For us, a film is poor, not bad, good, very good or excellent. The vast majority of films have things that are implausible or anachronistic and Allied certainly does but, hey ho, sit back and enjoy it because it's a film and not real life!
Bottom line - a cracking film and definitely worth watching if this type of film is your thing."
" Brad Pit does it again
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,9,"Engaging from the first shot, captivating all through but my best is the ending, emotional but I loved it"
" Beautiful film...
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,8,Allied was a great combination of drama and suspense with a good original storyline. Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard had a good performance and visually the film is beautiful.
" Piffle, piffle, piffle
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,1,"Apart from the opening acts this move is Piffle, piffle, piffle. There is no semblance of even a hint of a whiff of historical accuracy. About as convincing as Connery era James Bond movies and nowhere near as likely to keep you awake.The idea that moral in-turpitude was a fundamental value of British Intelligence is laughable."
" This screenwriter may be the best in the world
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,8,"I'm guessing this story was unlikely to have written but not yet. Even if it have, I doubt there would have been a successful film about it. It must be a great pleasure for a screenwriter to get a rare story like this. And this is a very good original script. I think the reason for the success of the film is the split storyline in the first and second sections. Overall, the romance and the suspense of war espionage are well interwoven and the flow and balance of the story is very good. It's even a bit unfair that no one can say anything about the writer who wrote such a great script, but only about the director. The screenwriter is Steven Knight. He has written some good films. I highly recommend you check it out.The director, Robert Zemeckis, only impressed me with Back to the Future and Real Steel. I looked into his works and found a lot of excellent works here as well. I'm looking forward to checking them out in the future."
" Criminally underrated
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,10,"I watched it 10 hours ago and i'm still crying. I never put a review here before but this time i will do because this Movie deserve it, that doesn't mean this Movie is the best but for sure it deserv your time."
" Takes too long to get going.
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,5,"Movie really starts 50min in when they sit Brad Pitt down. After that, it's pretty good. They really just need a good editor to cut like 15 minutes of the first 50 minutes. Then maybe it's a seven out of 10. The movie itself is well shot and looks good in a classical style. But we couldn't help getting resentful of them sort of wasting time elongating act one. Act two is a quick reveal of the choice. And the ending also kind of left something to be desired."
" Deserves better than 7.1 for sure
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,9,"Movie doesn't only have an interesting story but also have beautiful scenes and frames.
Brad Pitt's preformance can not go unnoticed.
The movie is able to capture intensity of being a spy."
" Nothing Much Going On Here
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,5,"I have a jaundiced view of the works of Robert Zemeckis, and have had since the inane Whitman's Sampler philosophy of Forrest Gump. In this one, Brad Pitt is a WWII Canadian spy sent on a mission to assassinate the German ambassador in Casablanca with Marion Cotillard. They fall in love, get married, have a daughter and then he is told that she is actually a German spy, whereupon he runs around to prove she isn't.My problem with Zemeckis' work is they seem to be intended to show off the latest technical advances, like the creepy Abnormal Valley of The Polar Express. Here's it's the exquisitely precise, photorealistic and picture-perfect world of World War II, which only causes me to focus on the wart on Miss Cotillard's forehead and the fact that Mr. Pitt is finally developing wattles. It's a pity, because unlike, say, Keanu Reaves, he can actually act."
" Pro Reviewers Wrong
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,8,"This is a well acted story, low-key, very well done. I really liked it."
" Brilliant movie
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,10,"Brad Pitt and the beautiful Marion Cotlllard cast as lovers ,in this touching tale based on a true story .Well worth watching
The negative reviews are just complete nonsense"
" How is this not rated higher
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,10,"From the moment she said, ""I keep the emotions real, that's why it works."" I suspected she was a Nazi. That foreshadowing was the only clue. The movie should have won lots of awards and all those who watch it must visit Medicine Hat! Bravo!"
" Didn't really enjoyed it 5/10
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,5,"With all the efforts made to make this movie a success I just don't see how good this movie was exactly, I can maybe say the acting was well done and the set decoration but nothing else. The whole plot just feels so slow and painful to wait for something to happen that you'd prefer to stop watching at the middle."
" Beautiful and Emotional
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,10,"Allied is surely a Must Watch.
A Beautiful Love story with an Inimitable Performances by the Lead.
There's a lot more beneath the film which can only be witnessed while watching."
" Good movie
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,8,This movie is very interesting and it is doesn't has a good reviews.
" Atmospheric
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,10,"This is old school World War 2 intrigue at its best. Brad Pitt used to be known as a fancy dan, now he's an A list actor, no longer the stereotype Clooney sidekick. Marvellous and atmospheric and with a cracking finale."
" Zoom
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,10,I like the bit when all them planes dropped a heap of bombs
" I don't even trust myself that much
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,7,"And this dude was a Wing Commander, beautiful nonetheless. Basically, Mr. & Mrs. Smith but 63 years ago."
" A throwback to the cinema of yesteryear
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,6,"What I appreciated most about ALLIED is that it feels very much like the character-focused thrillers of postwar Britain, in which any number of leading men of the time found themselves investigating conspiracies and the like and struggling to separate good from bad. This time around it's the world of spying in occupied France, as Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard play a married couple not dissimilar to those found in Pitt's earlier movie, MR. & MRS. SMITH. Halfway through, the action shifts to London and the story flags a little, only to pick up for a strong climax. It's not an action packed movie, although there are a handful of good set-pieces, but what sells this is both Pitt and Cotillard, the former strong-jawed and inherently decent, the latter full of spike and mystery."
" Great old school cinema that still lacks something...
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,5,"Positive:
The 40s brought to life magnificentlyNegative:
Brad Pitt doesn't fit the roleold-fashioned and thus not as vivid and exciting as modern movieslittle tension at times"
" What did you expect ?
",2020-01-08 00:00:00,8,"Robert Zemeckis...
Great story, greatly filmed .
Funny to see Brad Pitt talking french"
" Cliche
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,1,"What a cliche of a war movie.Parachuting into a dessert????? From every airborne jump in ww2 we learn how unbelievable difficult it is to get the airborne soldiers exactly in the landing zone, sometimes overshooting or undershooting it for miles. Soldiers being scattered all over the place and lost is more the reality. You do that sort of stuff in the dessert and it only takes a couple of miles off and you will never be able to find your way out of it. The pilot has no way of knowing his exact position in a dessert. There are no landmarks to navigate on. Simular to the problem the pilots of the Dday landings at night experienced. Soldiers taking a piss in the desert could easily get lost and separated from there outfit to sometimes be lost for ever. But Bratt Pitt being mister perfect, knows offcourse every grain of sand and sanddune in the dessert he has never lived in. For him it is just a hike."
" The Best Movie Ever
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,10,"Allied is the best Hollywood movie ,Great locations ,a good story ,and really superb acting by both MARION and BRAD ..MARION keeps a deep impression. World war 2 may be having such real stories.Sequences ,shooting locations , very good.. and best part is a mother MARION and her sacrifice ...But really felt very sad to see climax ..."
" OK
",2019-09-05 00:00:00,5,Many flaws in this movie. I did not feel that there was any chemistry or in any way believable as someone who fell in love and married. And the dubbing of pitts french was the nail in the coffin for me. Not a horrific film but unbelievable in all aspects and not true to any realty. And I think this is the shortest review I've ever written...
" my notes
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,1,I watched like 40 torturously boring minutes of this movie before i started skipping through to see the major parts. so boring. why did they make it. for old ppl i guess. brad pitt is a beast of an actor though (1 viewing)
" A Period Spy Saga that's strictly Above Average !
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,7,"When it is a world war 2 time's Spy saga, helmed by Brad Pitt & Marion Marion Cotillard with Robert Zemeckis behind Camera, you will be brimming with excitement and anticipation of a well told & well-made story that befits everybody's lofty standards. Well it does but just above average. This potboiler, resembles Casablanca a lot but made little different in terms of plot that unfolds a little different.The movie opens to the premise of both the spies Pitt & Marion enacting the roles of a Married French Couple. With that as the background where both are pitted behind enemy lines to do an encore with the Nazis where Pitt is a Canadian RAF Wing Commander and Marion as French Resistance operative, pull off an assassination coup with perfect finesse & understanding that they both fall in love and get married post that daring operation and escape from there. Back in UK they do get married and have a child (The child birth happens when the German air raid is happening and, in a half, shelled hospital and bombs are getting dropped left and right. Looks kind of dramatic). Then then settle in such a neighbourhood of London, which is a war time settlement for Jewish intellects, free mind European refugees, artists, haute couture types, other various freethinkers and free-lovers. Then the Brits suspect her to be a spy on British Military now and is double crossing her unsuspecting husband since the WW2 is still ON. How the movie unfolds from there and heads towards a climax forms the rest of the story in 2nd half.Marion has put in a pretty enigmatic performance which does look flawless at times and unconvincing at times. Pitt is kind of below par in his performance may be since knowing his acting prowess we expect more from him. Though the movie is flawless in terms of technicalities with vintage frames & locales and camera angles that transform you to the WW2 period with no room for any errors including even the camera work & editing. The Technical brilliance of Zemeckis shine bright when that aspect is considered. He also deftly covers the blind faith and the bonding that forms the basis of a relationship, the trust factor which holds and some times blinds the relationship angle into fine tuning that with of suspicions that form part and parcel of spying and how they raise their head in family background...et all with consummate ease which Zemeckis can pull off in a very fine tuned fashion. But something lacks with Brad which is little difficult to pin point. He comes across as more technical than heart in it kind of performance, overall.Had Pitt put in a little more INVOLVED performance as finely honed that he is in acting which he is known for, this movie would have upped the bar that high which we know he is capable of but alas. It falls a TRIFLE SHORT to drive home that nuanced plot which Zemeckis wants to drive home that with personal lives of spying as profession couple makes it difficult to trust even the life partner you think that you know fully well and that speck of doubt and devil in the detail & nagging DOUBT remain a CONSTANT without ever ceasing to exist, even after your JOB/PROFESSIONAL DUTY does. Having said that its not a passe but it keeps you engrossed for most of its almost 2 hour run time. Zemeckis has taken very little freedom to express this saga of history, passion, despair and war story and kept it almost true to the period it belongs to, with very little deviation in the form of allegiance & Constance to history 😊"
" Love : casualty of war!
",2019-06-16 00:00:00,9,WW2 setting and a love story interwoven so deep that it cross enemy lines. Absolutely remarkable movie about true love which conquered even the opposites where integrating honesty and to overcome the Nazis was held paramount in the days. One of the different World War Two movies I have seen since Casablanca and a marvellous one at that!
" Better than I expected
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,9,"This is a great movie. It turned out to be a lot better than I thought it would. Very plausible except in some minor parts. Didn't spot any anachronisms with wartime London except I don't think you'd have seen a German fighter at the time it was set, and in a night air raid, nor an allied one! Apart from that, Pitt and Cotillard are brilliant. Very moving and tragic end."
" Awful
",2019-06-06 00:00:00,4,"The script is garbage, worst spy movie I have ever seen, save yourself 2 hours of your life and skip this movie"
" An interesting story line but. . . . .
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,6,". . . . it kinda fell apart at the end.It was well-acted by all concerned and very nice plot development. But it's hard to believe that, once Brad's wife and mother of his child was proven to be a German Nazi operative now based with him back in the U.K., that he would be ordered to execute her. Or face mega consequences. No arrest as a Nazi plant and perhaps getting valuable info from her, but it was Brad's task to kill the woman he loved and leave his child motherless.Huh? Even the convicted Nazi war criminals in the ""Judgement at Nuremburg"" didn't serve their full sentences. Just a disappointing resolution and conclusion."
" AMAZING
",2019-05-25 00:00:00,10,"This movie was the best and I do not regret buying a ticket at the cinema to watch this.
This themed movie is something I love when it comes to war and love.
lets just say the ending made me cry because it was not expected but I will not say what happens don't want to spoil it for anyone who has not yet watched it.
GO AND WATCH IT"
" Couldn't Get Through It (Several Times)
",2019-05-07 00:00:00,3,"Pitt being my favorite actor, I've tried my best to watch this movie. But I could not get myself to do it. It's got thriller in it, and a romance with that famous French actress that guts Bman at the end of Dark Knight Rises. But come on. I need some more action and story then what they're offering.Spy thrillers should be dark and cold. This one seems to constantly trying to hide the fact that they're lead actor is aging. And knowledgeably.Not worth my time.3 stars"
" We'll Always Have Casablanca
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,4,"Marion Cotillard and Brad Pitt smooching alongside the dunes of the Sahara Desert and their loyalties being tested amid the air-bombed skies of WWII London, with Robert Zemeckis and company behind the camera to lend at least a simulacrum of Classic Hollywood imagery (albeit largely created by modern CGI), to the point that one cannot help but contemplate and compare it to that studio-system masterpiece ""Casablanca"" (1942), ""Allied"" does have a good deal of drama, star power and production values to recommend it. But, of course, ""Casablanca"" it isn't. Even still, there's enough intrigue here--although the action scenes are doggedly non-suspenseful--to make for a pretty, if forgettable, romantic spy thriller. Unfortunately, the sappy epilogue leaves a bitter taste. I should've known the maker of such simplistic fare as ""Forrest Gump"" (1944) couldn't help but spell everything out for us, leaving nothing to the imagination and appealing to the crassest of emotions. Rick would disapprove and so do I."
" Resistance is possible
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,5,"Bet your life or bet your wife is the big question at the centre of this would-be World War 2 blockbuster thriller starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. Pitt plays a Canadian pilot who's the British Army's go-to guy for dangerous undercover missions. Cotillard is the French Resistance leader he encounters and has to partner in his latest assignment, a Heydrich-type assassination of the German ambassador in Casablanca. Of course you know that as soon as this good-looking couple say to each other that they'll determinedly resist any mutual physical attraction for fear of jeopardising their operation, the next minute they'll be making mad passionate love in a car in the middle of a sandstorm. Despite now by their own admission, being emotionally compromised, they still make like a wartime Mr and Mrs Smith and ruthlessly carry out their appointed task in loud, spectacular fashion.Mission accomplished and by now madly in love, the action switches to London as they settle down to domesticity, setting up home in Hampstead, getting married and having their first child, a daughter born, as you'd almost expect for this all-action couple, outside in the street while a German air-raid is raging all around them. Their ensuing cosy family life however is exploded by a tip-off to Pitt from on-high that his wonderful wife is in fact a German double-agent which sets in motion the final act where he finds out the truth about her, leading to a highly charged climax followed by a succeeding downbeat pastoral conclusion where all is explained.At heart, this is an old fashioned war-time melodrama where you can almost imagine Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman in the two leads if it had been made way back in the 40's. That said, Pitt and Cotillard aren't the incomparable Mr Grant and Miss Bergman and I personally doubt whether Cary and Ingrid would have willingly signed-up to this too far-fetched feature. From its would-be dramatic opening scene of Pitt parachuting into the desert where you can see the CGI fakery and succeeding ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" panoramic shot right through to the shades of ""Gladiator"" ending, never mind the obvious nods to the original ""Casablanca"" of course, you can see the epic status for which director Robert Zemeckis is aiming but the film in the end just can't overcome its propensity for big, over-dramatic scenes and its too fantastic plot."

",2019-03-05 00:00:00,10,This is by far one of my favorite movies for Brad Pitt. Plus I love historical dramas! It might seem weird to some but I adore this movie. Marion's acting is excellent as well.
" Beautiful love story during WW2
",2019-02-27 00:00:00,9,The film is really well made with good acting all around. The cinematography is epic with many catching scenes like airplane approaching home or sex in desert that demonstrates the passion and fear in very brilliant way. The strory is catching and you would like to follow it through the end with an amazing mystery that will be solved near the end. The only thing that deduct from 10 score is slow pace at the first half of the film. Although it matched the theme of the film but can be faster. The sound editing and music of film was good too with lots sound features that elvate the cinematography of the film.
" Beautiful, exciting and heartbreaking movie!
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,9,"First ever review and such a good film to start with! Wasn't sure it was my kind of movie until I discovered Bob Zemeckis directed then I thought I'd give it a shot. Brad Pitt is such a watchable actor these days and Marion Cotilliard has a unique presence about her that allows the story to move effortlessly from one scene to the next with total believability and sincerity. Once the story settles in London it is fascinating to see what I believe and hope the atmosphere and visuals were during that period if the war. The director has such a varied and glittering back catalogue that I firmly believe he researched the time period and got it exactly right. The ending was tough to watch after investing so much in the characters but I guess that's what movies are all about. Well worth a watch for anybody who appreciates top class storytelling and I would quite honestly describe this as a modern classic, albeit set 75yrs ago!"
" Loved it, felt it.
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,9,"Great movie. Great screenplay, great story, great actors, great costumes and effects.
The engine of the movie took a little to start, but when it started was outstanding.
Spies, love and war, well mixed, an explosive combination, I never knew what was going to happen and, most important I was always looking forward to discover it. I totally was catched by it and at the end I admit I was moved and spilled a couple of tears: pretty much an overwhelming history.
Brad and Marillon are outstanding, they really appears as spies used to hide who they are and what they're thinking and doing.
The explosive combination is explosive for the unexpected plot twist. That's too bad, because the fact that I know how it end will spoil the rewatches of this movies, because I will watch it again for sure.
Hope you enjoy too."
" Fun romantic spy romp
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,7,"This is one of those films that you approach expecting something different to what you get. The trailer and summary made me believe it would be a serious drama exploring love and loyalty in WWII, but The English Patient this ain't...This is more like a revisionist 21st Century reboot of Casablanca, and is old fashioned fun in a very similar vein.The comparisons between the two films are interesting and fun to note: this pair only pretend to have a history in Paris, but will 'always have Casablanca'; instead of a 1940s lame dame we have a 21st Century gun toting super spy; and instead of wartime sacrifice we get an ending where the fate of the lovers does amount to a hill of beans or five (very dishonourably!). It feels like, by riffing so obviously on the events in Casablanca, the film makers are inviting us to compare today's values with those of the 1940s.The script is excellent with some revelations handled superbly. The performances are strong enough. The sets and set pieces are beautiful. Okay there are anachronisms and inaccuracies but this isn't The English Patient, this is a sub-par Casablanca. And even a sub-par Casablanca is worth a watch."
" Thought it was good
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,7,It was pretty good. I don't really have any complaints. It's kind of sad.
" visually stunning, broken story
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,7,"As another reviewer said, the story offered places for a plot twist, but the writer or director failed to take up the opportunity. Through most of the film Marianne Beauséjour is the more interesting character. and once they move to London, the story is hers. She was conflicted, but we don't get to see much of this internal conflict -- rather the story follows the male lead, Max Vatan, played by Bradd Pitt. He should have been but a supporting role to her story. Once again, another film that could have been great had they worked on the script like they worked on the set design. On the whole, worth watching for the sets and setting, and the conflict with the Germans."
" I really enjoyed this movie
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,8,In spite of what others have said in reviewing this movie I really enjoyed it. It kept the suspense going as to whether she was good or bad going well. It was good easy watching and made for an enjoyable Saturday nights movie watch.
" Intriguing but hollow
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,8,"This review contains spoilers.Allied is a war movie that premiered in 2016. The movie directed by Robert Zemeckis and is written by Steven Knight. The movie stars Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. The movie is about a Canadian intelligence officer that falls in love with a French Resistance fighter. The movie follows the two main leads as they go through the Second World War.Allied is a beautiful movie. The entire movie is beautifully lit with gorgeous sets. Robert Zemeckis also directs this movie well. The scenes have a great flow and tone to them. In addition all of the effects in the movie are at a high class. One can easily like the movie on the visuals by itself.The acting and chemistry from the leads is natural. It feels organic to see the interaction between Pitt's character of Max Vatan and Marion Cotillard's character of Marianne Beausejour. I did like the growing romance between the two leads. Especially towards the end when Max Vatan had to question his loyalties. The movie does great whenever it presents these two on the screen.The movie does not tread new ground. Everything that this movie does feels familiar. This is either from the setting, genre, or story the movie possesses. The only vaguely original idea that the movie has is the one romance in its leads. This is not even an original idea as this is a concept that has been done before. The execution of these ideas is interesting.The writing is hit and miss. I felt that much of the movie was drawn out for too long. The main plot and source of thrill with finding out if Marianne Beausejour is a double agent or not does not kick in until about half way through the movie. The journey is still cool and fun to watch but the movie feels like two separate movies.The first half of the movie introduces the audience to the two leading characters. This introduction has many characters that never come back later. The introduction is slick and entertaining but it fails to have a larger impact other than the immediate romance.The movie is also predictable. I was hoping for a twist on some interesting way for Max, Vatan to find if his wife is a spy or not. This unfortunately never happened. Instead the movie had Max Vatan undertake extreme missions to find his out about his wife. This is incredibly ridiculous to watch as Max takes on squads of German soldiers. The movie should not be an action movie. It should focus on the characters which is where the directing and writing excels at.I would recommend Allied.Grade: B"
" Brad Pitt as I'd never seen him before.
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,9,"A damn great movie, well acted, authentic looking scenery vehicles etc. Fast moving and an excellent script. The action and battle scenes are well done and realistic, even nail biting in parts. If I wanted to be picky, I could say that shouldn't have happened, or this didn't look right. But hey, this is only for entertainment, not educational."
" An Honest Review
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,10,"Marion Cotillard, yeah, she's one of those people that you know you've seen her before but you can't exactly place her and it tortures you for the duration of the film.She also looks so much like she was actually from The Greatest Generation that she's probably one of those actors that can morph with every role she's in. And, looking at her on IMDB, I've actually seen her more than I thought I had.At any rate, she blends well with the era...but, unfortunately, Pitt looks less from the times than he did in his other WWII movies, which is odd given how he can blend as well. I guess the producers wanted to feature him more for the draw of Brad Pitt.In either case, it is a suspenseful and emotional film and one that will sit among the better spy movies ever made. It's low key, the action and the violence is down played to the point where it's far removed from Bond and comes across as a very straight spy thriller.In other words it's the type of movie we unfortunately don't see enough of these days, subtle and straight. It's a movie that is based around the characters, the script, and the acting more than special effects and because of that it's easy to get involved emotionally with the plot and the people, even if it does move a bit faster than I would have liked.Overall, it's a breath of fresh air in the era of the MCU and over-the-top effects and it pays off in the end from pure emotion. You can't get much better."
" Something's missing
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,7,"Watched waiting for a wow moment...didn't happen,whilst it's a good film and a good story line for me she was the wrong actress for this part, she was good in ""A good year"" but never seen her in a good movie since, I am a fan of older war movies as they take the time to be more in depth and hold the audience in more suspense. I think that more could have shown her past,maybe some going back in time scenes and make the movie longer, I enjoyed it anyway.its almost as if modern movies are in a hurry to end which means a great deal of story's are missed or hurried ruining the quality ...we don't all need special effects just more to hold our interest."
" super screnning..
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,9,"Exillant movie,super star cast and i saw vintage vew and plotting like 1942...thanks"
" ""I keep the emotions real. That's why it works.""
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,8,"I was surprised by the unmistakable references to the 1942 movie ""Casablanca"". There's the French Morocco location where Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) and Marianne Beauséjour (Marion Cotillard) first meet to open the picture, of course. The story itself is based on wartime intrigue, espionage, and romance, and it was probably too obvious a decision by the film makers to have Max ask Marianne to play The Marseillaise on the piano. And he did it by saying ""I want you to play it for me"".There's also a bit of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" going for the principals, a kick to the gut for Max when he learns that his superiors believe Marianne is a German spy. The 'blue-dye' operation that the V Section chief intended to initiate sounded like something fictional, but during World War II, German prisoners of war were given denim jackets to wear with the letters 'POW' painted on the back. Eventually the number of POW's outnumbered the availability of denim jackets, so dark blue dye was used to stain their own Wehrmacht uniforms. Within the context of the story, the blue dye operation was meant to expose Marianne for her loyalty to the Nazis.Given Marianne's ease at maintaining a facade as a spy (see summary quote above), it takes some time into the movie to determine whether she married Max for love or not. I thought it was taking things pretty far to get married and have a child with someone in order to fulfill a mission, so when it's eventually revealed that she did pass along the 'blue dye' message, it's almost a twist in a story that winds up with an even bigger one at the finale. The thing that bothered me about the picture was how Max's superiors always knew what he was doing. As an experienced agent, it didn't seem credible that they'd always be a couple steps ahead of him to know what he was doing to find out the truth about his wife. But then again, he did engage in some risky behavior to learn Marianne's true identity."
" Very entertaining suspenseful and romantic world war II espionage drama.
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,7,"""Allied"" is sometimes a bit slick and sentimental. Never too much though, but it shows that it is still a hollywood production. The acting is somewhat stiff at times. Those are my only 2 complaints, because overall this movie is very suspenseful and that suspense keeps this movie thrilling till the very end. But ""Allied"" needs a long build up. So please be patient, because there will come several very interesing plot turns, which take the movie into a totally different direction then I could have suspected.Brad Pitt fans will love this movie, especially the ladies will be pleased, because there is a lot of romance going on between Brad Pitt and Marion Cottilard, with her stunning puppy brown eyes. Naugthy detail:this is suppose to be the movie in which Brad Pitt had the alleged affair with Marion Cottilard on the movie set, which was the cause for the divorce from Angelina Jolie. Despite all the fuss about the alleged affair, the romance in the story makes this an ideal date movie. But guys could love this espionage thriller as well, because the suspense part is really smart and thrilling. It is not a full on action war movie though, but it has a few resistance action scenes. However the romance and espionage part is the main focus of the story of ""Allied"". Lots of (romantic) talk and espionage suspicion going on simultaneously. That mix works rather well...Although there (fortunately) isnt a hollywood happy end, the end doesnt give us viewers a big downer either. Although it has a dramatic ending, overall it is just a really charming and suspenseful espionage thriller. I would settle for less..."
" Better lovestrory!
",2018-11-13 00:00:00,8,"Casablanca - apparently very lovely place to fall in love. ""Allied"", same like ""Casablanca"" made believe in love during most difficult times of humanity. Picturing struggle and pain and beauty of life - violence and nature collide in this piece!"
" Please put some effort in a movie
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,6,"A failed attempt to create a good movie out of a mediocre story. The lack of a clear choice and a that this film disappoints. This film lacks the thrill for a thriller, the backgrounds for a war film and the depth for a drama. It is too thin a story that keeps floating on the surface. Even in a 'prelude' of a whole hour it fails to create engagement with the characters and even lacks to develop them. Brat Pitt in particular remains plastic in a failed attempt to 'under-act'. A slow-paced movie can be great. This one just did not deliver.The whole movie feels like the inside of a moviestudio. A few, too imposed, 'artistic' scenes do not raise the uninspiring cinematography.In my opinion a director does not always need to have the urge to elevate the public or make a profound statement in every movie... but, with that budget and talent... Please put some effort in a project and at least try to make us remember the movie!"
" Old fashioned thriller with heart
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,9,"There have been so many negative reviews I had to write what I feel is an accurate review.
I really liked this film it had everything you would want in a ww2 thriller and love story,a nod to Casablanca and the English patient .
The story is a girl meets guy during an espionage mission. They marry and move to England and there we are intrigued by their life and what happens next.
Good script ,costumes and direction with great performances from Brad and Marion plus Simon birney and Jared Harris.
It's really worth watching grabs you all the way through and leaves you with a feeling of having an experience which is rare these days."
" It missed the mark - could have been better
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,5,"Was there ever a doubt as to how this film would end? Not at all. Pitt and Cottillard are easy on the eyes, but so wooden. Particularly Pitt. I never thought he was a true ""actor"" - more of a awesome male specimen -- and this film did nothing to change my opinion of him. Nice to look at, but no range in his acting ability. She on the other hand is a good actress, but I think the direction and the script boxed her in this time.The CGI wasn't necessary for what is essentially a drawing room drama and they were terribly noticeable and distracting. The costumes were incredible -- but almost over the top for two people in their stations in life. It's hard to conceive to a military man being able to afford such suits and topcoats in war-torn London. And his wife would have similarly had to be frugal in her clothes by necessity. But not in Hollywood -- money is no object when it comes to dressing these two.I'd rather watch Casablanca again."
" Plot Unbelievably Far-fetched and preposterous
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,1,"The basic premises of the movie are rotten to the core: why would SOE send a high ranking officer to assassinate a German embassador to Morocco? What was there to be achieved? Of all Nazis why kill this one? Didn't they know he was a dissident? How would the Germans have known that the British were sending an unmarried officer? How could they have expected the whole thing and plant an imposter to wait for the British agent? Why choose to kill the ambassador at the party, creating such a ruckus?"
" Great
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,6,"The movie directed Robert Zemeckis, and star is Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard.
This movie is a classic romance. It has a bit of espionage, it has a lot of war and a romantic moments. When you love Brad Pitt, you have to watch it.I don't know what I can write about it. Some times I couldn't understand why actions are under limits of reality, some times I had a feeling that there were so many sex scenes, and moreover they were so long.The actions scenes, are well choreographed and fun to watch. Marion and Brad are both convincing, and they are well- trained spies who don't hesitate to kill.The movie takes place in the second war. There is very good description of life during a dangerous war. From one side there were parties, sex, alcohol, drugs form the second side people have to know what their priorities are."
" Disappointed
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,6,"I have to start by saying that I was hoping for more. The actors were great, the setting was great, the idea was great but the final product is just lacking in almost every way possible. I think that it's a shame because this could've been one of the best movies in its genre had it just been a bit better at everything it tried to do.Allied takes place during the final years of World War 2. Now, this is a period of history that I have always found to be very interesting and thus, I have always sought after movies that take place in that period. So it's fair to say that I was rather excited when this film first came out. After reading first reviews and hearing what people thought about it I got somewhat discouraged and completely forgot about it until Netflix recommended it for me. I will say that I'm glad that I've seen it and can now judge it myself. It wasn't bad in the ways that I was expecting it to be, but it is far from perfect.Firstly, Brad Pitt felt a tad bit bored. There isn't anything wrong with his performance but it just didn't feel particularly interesting.
Secondly, there are times when Allied feels incredibly slow moving. Perhaps if the movie had been 10-15 minutes shorter it would've been better. The beginning is good, the early bit of action is good and the ending, I thought, was very well done. However, most of the stuff in between could've been done much quicker and the film would have had a better flow.
Finally, I have to credit the visuals of this film. The costume design is brilliant, the world makes you feel like you are in the Second World War and the filming and lighting are great.I really wish that Allied had been a better film. It's not bad and it certainly is enjoyable to watch. I just feel that with small adjustments it could've been much, much better."
" Nothing new but still a well made war/romance movie....worth a watch
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,7,"Neither Brad nor Marion disappoints you in this WW2 drama. The casting, acting, pacing, feel and suspense comes together in a well packaged flick which deserves a view if you like any single aspects aforementioned.If you are looking for a better movie in the same genre then watch 'The English Patient'."
" Not what I expected but a good film anyway
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,7,"After reading the synopsis for this film I expected to watch more of a romance drama, but what I got was a wartime drama that kept you guessing about the plot throughout. The acting by both Pitt and Cottilard was on point throughout and the story was always engaging. It's a very good film with some great scenes which would be enjoyed by all"
" Solid drama let down by an inconceivably stupid ending
",2018-09-24 00:00:00,7,"Incredible premise, some strong drama and great questions... and the ending is just terrible. It makes less than zero sense. A ginormous misfire. How did that get into the final draft?"
" A Wartime Tragedy
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,9,"The pacing of ""Allied"" could be called into question - mostly because what you really have here are three stories in one, each with a very different feel, although the thread that holds the movie together runs through all three. The first is the story of the attack by the French Resistance on the German Ambassador in Casablanca, in Vichy-French held Morocco. The story opens with Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) - a Canadian officer working ifor British intelligence who's sent in to take part in the attack. He meets up with Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard) - a member of the Resistance who's leading the attack. This part of the story was pretty fast paced and exciting. It leads in to the second story - a love story between Max and Marianne. They fall in love, and he takes her with him to London, where they marry and have a daughter and spend a couple of years living together in obvious domestic bliss. The story slows down here, befitting the new tone, and helps to flesh out the two characters. The domestic bliss is interrupted by the third part of the story, when the British come to believe that Marianne is actually a German spy, and if they can prove it Max is told that he'll be ordered to kill her. So the movie becomes a sort of suspense-drama. Is she or isn't she? And there's reason to believe either. In a sense these are three very different stories, but I thought they were woven together pretty well and made a movie that was both enjoyable and interesting to watch. Pitt and Cotillard both gave good performances. Marianne was a social animal who liked people and parties, and Max was more of a quiet loner who kept his emotions very much in check, and both actors captured those personalities. The two worked very well together. The movie does have some strange plotholes and inconsistencies. It was established in Morocco that Max's accent was Quebecois rather than Parisienne (very different) - but Marianne seems able to fix that in just a few days so that no one ever seems to become suspicious that Max may not be who he seems to be? That was a bit strange. And I thought the introduction of Max's sister as a lesbian with her lover in tow was awkward and unnecessary - a relationship unlikely to be lived so openly at that time in history, and therefore it came across as tokenism for today's audience more than anything else. But all movies are going to have points you can quibble about. These were things I noticed, but they didn't really detract from my enjoyment of the movie.""Allied"" builds up very nicely to its last few tragic scenes, and in the end the movie does become a tragedy more than anything else, with the end (with the reading of a letter that Marianne wrote to her daughter) being truly heartwrenching. I'd say that ""Allied"" is by no means perfect - but it is an altogether enjoyable movie with a compelling story (or stories) and believable performances from the leads. (9/10)"
" best movie i have ever seen
",2018-08-18 00:00:00,9,I have watched a lots of movies and this story of love and war and politics and the ending was just different and amazing ...!
" Famed director's homage to WW II classic spy thrillers proves entertaining but lugubrious with a not so believable plot
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,5,"Poor Brad Pitt! Like his heartthrob predecessor before him, Paul Newman, he bitterly resents the eye candy appellation bestowed upon him by millions of star-struck women worldwide. As a reaction formation, he has consistently been determined to prove that he's a legitimate actor and seeks out roles that suggest at his deepest core, that he has ""heart.""
 Here he's playing Canadian RAF wingman turned spy, Max Vatan, parachuting into 1942 French Morocco (specifically Casablanca) under the auspices of British intelligence. The mission is to hook up with the French Resistance agent, Marianne Beauséjour (famed French actress Marion Cotillard) and assassinate the German ambassador.
 Veteran famed director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump) along with screenwriter Steven Knight have fashioned an homage to the grand old War War II espionage thrillers of yesteryear, specifically the Humphrey Bogart-Ingrid Bergman classic, Casablanca, as well as perhaps Hitchcock's Notorious, featuring Cary Grant teamed up with the ubiquitous Bergman. Notably, the city of Casablanca receives Zemeckis' rather squeaky clean, art deco makeover that will impress those who yearn for some heady nostalgia.
 Unfortunately, the first half of Allied proves not only lugubrious but rather unconvincing plot-wise. There's the whole problem of Max's non-Parisian accent which Marianne is convinced she can help improve in a week's time-enough to fool a coterie of unsuspecting Germans they are required to deceive. Not buying it!
 Worse is the mission itself. What good can come from knocking off the German Ambassador? Can't the Germans simply replace him? And killing Germans seems to be a rather easy feat in Vichy controlled Casablanca. Before the big assassination scene, Max chokes a German officer to death in a bathroom believing that he's encountered him before (fearing his cover might be blown). No manhunt ensues and presumably, none of the witnesses came forward to place Max and Marianne at the scene.
 We later find out in the second half that the German Ambassador was some sort of ""dissident"" and the assassination was ordered by Hitler himself, with Max as a dupe and (SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD) Marianne acting as a double agent for the Germans. If you believe it you also have to believe that Hitler was willing to sacrifice dozens of German soldiers to keep up the pretense, after Max and Marianne rather conveniently mow them all down with machine guns they surreptitiously (and again rather easily) brought to the Ambassador's residence.
 The ""meat"" of the story is only introduced in the second half of the film when Max is informed by the super-secret V-section of British intelligence that they believe Marianne is a double agent. They devise a test where Max receives classified information and writes it down on a notepad after receiving a call from them in the middle of the night. If the info pops up from intercepted German communications in the next few days, that's proof that Marianne is a spy who culled it from Max's notepad.
 The ugly revelation propels Max to find a way to disprove the more than dispiriting allegations. By now it's established that Max and Marianne are truly in love, having produced a child within a year's time after they've returned to London. Many critics have decried a lack of chemistry between the principals and it's probably because Max is too taciturn of a character to believe he's fallen completely head over heels for the far more emotional Marianne. Screenwriter Knight attempts to establish the existence of a strong bond between the two through an early lovemaking scene in a sandstorm prior to the couple's return to London, where perhaps anxiety over constant Nazi buzz bomb attacks is enough to suggest a deep love connection.
 Knight is much more successful in the denouement when he finally affords Pitt the opportunity to become much more animated and emotive. Max, against orders, flies to France to question Delamare, a former spy now imprisoned in a Vichy jail, who is the only one who can disprove that Marianne is working for the Germans. He notes he saw her play La Marseilles on the piano a few years before so, in the film's second most dramatic scene, Max brings her to a pub and insists that she play the song on a piano there.
 Of course, she's unable to do so, proving indeed she's been a double agent all along. Max, still in love with her, wants to escape to Switzerland and drives to the air base with her and baby in tow. Marianne insists that she's been in love with Max since Casablanca and basically argues that her handlers forced her (by threatening to harm her child) to continue with her spy activities.
 The climax is actually kind of touching with Marianne committing suicide and Max's friend Colonel Frank Heslop (Jared Harris) preventing Max from being court-martialed after he failed to follow orders to kill Marianne had he learned she was a spy. It's a little too late, but Pitt shows his ""heart"" as much later he becomes the father who raised a daughter, who never knew her mother (Cotillard gets to read a dramatic, emotional letter she writes to the daughter a day before she kills herself).
 Allied is reasonably entertaining despite the lugubrious pacing and not so believable plot machinations early on. See it for Cotillard's intense performance. As for Pitt, give him a ""B"" for effort, despite being saddled with such a taciturn role."
" Cheesy romantic thriller fun
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,5,"Allied is set in the midst of WW2. It sees Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard as secret agents in Casa Blanca, where they start their romantic adventure. They end up in London where it turns out that Marion is perhaps a double agent for the Germans.The entire film is shot with an absurd amount of filter and Hollywood esqu likeness. To further separate the audience, the script and dialogue do not allow any chemistry to be developed between the central characters. As this is integral in the start of any film, I could not engage fully.Nevertheless, in the second act it is learned that Marion is perhaps a double agent. Although rather predictable, from this point forward the pace is picked up and keeps you guessing until the end. This is its strongest point.Allied is supposedly loosely based on a true story, yet portrays scenes of an impossible and almost absurd nature. To exemplify this is a pregnancy that takes place in the middle of a war zone. There is also an extremely cheesy sex scene in a car while the camera is being spun and sand is thrown at the car windows. These scenes feel like they are forcing you to engage with the characters but just leave you laughing at the absurdity. Although it is a corny mess with the character interactions, the thriller aspects created an overall enjoyable experience."
" Much better than attendu
",2018-07-05 00:00:00,8,There was minimalist tension from start. Why nobody follow after attack in Casablanca but love is real and war is cruel. Like a Iconic Love Story (movie) placed to WW2 time.
" The end was very emotional
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,10,"This is one of those movies you can not know what would happen until the very ending,the movie was very entertaining and full of switches the ending was unpredictable this was a great story and also a word class acting."
" Real, touching
",2018-06-22 00:00:00,8,"Overall I liked the film - the story, how was made with exception of Brad Pitt performance. He is not a good actor. I have more actors in mind that would've played that role much better - Pitt ruins the whole film! He is artificial and soulless, as if he does it just because somebody asked him but he didn't want. If it wasn't for him, the film would be great. Marion Cotillard as always gives her best."
" A movie you either really like, or really hate
",2018-06-14 00:00:00,8,"I'm one of those people that love these types of films, where the ending ain't really all that happy. Something about them just rings true to me. In my opinion, a good film is this: Some people should love it, and some people should hate it. That's right where a good film should be.Moving on, I love the spy thrillers, so that's what roped me in on this one. Marion Cotillard does a fabulous job. I can't find anywhere to knock on her performance. This wasn't Pitt's BEST performance...but it sure as hell wasnt bad either. The reason I've rated this film as an 8 is mainly due to poor editing. There's numerous times where the continuity of action was very poor, and some very rough cuts when it came to sound.All in all, I enjoyed this film very much, and recommend it to anyone with an open mind."

" Gorgeous film-making
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,8,"A very enjoyable film with beautiful cinematography and excellent performances. The overall production values are excellent, as you might expect from the headline talent. The story poses a unique premise and keeps you hooked until everything is revealed in the end. In an age where special effects have taken over, it's refreshing to watch a film
that mainly cares about characters and complex human situations. Yet for anyone wanting to see war action, you'll get plenty of that as well.The stars themselves and the costumes all look stunning. Yes almost too stunning at times, but it's so glorious to look at you can forgive the film-makers for that. Some ridiculous negative reviews prevented me from seeing this in theatres, which I now regret. Tosh from Marvel keeps scoring high on RT, but then you see it and it's complete garbage about crystals (every movie, seriously). Films like Allied deserve more serious attention. Overall, well worth a look!"
" Flawed in the writing
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,6,"Max Vatan falls in love with Marianne Beausejour on an assassination mission behind enemy line during World War II and invites her back to London where they marry and have a child. But a secretive security officer tells Max that they suspect Marianne is a spy. They will feed her false information via Max and, if this proves her guilt, then Max will have to execute her, or face being hanged himself. That much you will know from the trailer, and the issue of whether Marianne is guilty or not, and what Max gets up to in pursuit of the truth, are not matters which I propose to spoiler in this review.What I will say is that as soon as security man Simon McBurney (who really does do slimey and obnoxious better than almost anyone else) tells Max about their suspicions and what the protocol was for dealing with them, the film lost me.A huge question exploded in my head. It was ""Why are you telling him?"" The protocol could be applied just as effectively without Max ever knowing until Marianne's guilt was proved, so why would you tell him before he needs to know, and run the risk of him going off the rails and following his own course of action? Which, of course, is exactly what he does. A midnight trip to a police station in occupied France in order to interview a drunk, followed by breaking into a pub for a bit of patriotic piano-playing? Whoa, Nellie.I understand that the threat of having to execute your own wife is a terrific engine with which to drive a story, but the major flaw in its execution stalled it for me - a flaw which could have been easily solved with better writing, by the way.The film looks very authentic, and there are some good action sequences and pleasing and touching performances (and Pitt gets to do his Paltrow's head performance again), But it should have tried harder to stay on the rails, in my view."
" Beautiful movie
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,9,"I don't my movie to be perfect. What I need is to walk away a feel something. This was not the ending I was expecting and it has left me feeling a great deal. Marion and Brad were terrific together and I genuinely believed them as these two characters. As spies in 1942 Casablanca they come together on a mission to kill a German Ambassador and while doing so they fall in love. Some might argue that it was superficial, but I can imagine putting your lives on the line together and coming out ok might create a real bond. Yes the movie has slow moments, but again it was about these two love for each other and whether or not you believed it. I for one did, and that was enough for me."
" A good take on romance during wartime
",2018-03-28 00:00:00,7,"There is always much anticipation when Robert Zemeckis released a movie and while ""Allied"" did not win any major awards, it's still a good entry into Zemeckis' wonderful library of films.""Allied"" stars Brad Pitt as a Canadian intelligence officer and Marion Cotillard as a French Resistance fighter who were put together as a faux husband and wife in order to collect information against the Nazis in Casablanca during World War II. Eventually their relationship begins to develop and sure enough plans are about to change. The chemistry between the two was great and the scenes in which they were intimate were well made, high notes on the car in the desert storm scene.It is labeled as a war film, but war is not the most important thing in the movie, as hope and romance stand out in Zemeckis' glamorous and graceful style, adding to it beautiful costumes and set-pieces.""Allied"" is a great choice of film when it comes to romance during wartime and a good choice to watch with the person special to you."

" It's worth it
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,9,"Movies are made for entertainment. Whether the movie is based on a true story or a fictional story, scenes are known to be exaggerated from the original fact. For the most part, movies are not meant to be informational, if you are looking for an informational film, you should be looking at documentaries, not movies. One of the most emotional and entertaining film I have ever watched has to be Allied.Allied is a movie based on the time period of world war 2 in the united kingdom. It jumps around from the opening scene in Casablanca where the main character meets another French operative. The movie follows a Canadian commanding officer deployed in the UK during world war 2. It follows the same guy through his time, during which he found the love of his life during a mission in Casablanca and started a family with a colleague who, along side him, fought together against the Nazis. But, all of his life in the UK, turned out to be a lie. The best and most memorable moment was when he finds out that the love of his life was actually a Nazis spy the whole time, working with other spies in their neighborhood. There was a scene just before this where the husband wanted to know if his wife is actually a spy so he went to France to ask a drunk about his wife. From this meeting, he found out that she played the French national anthem in front of German officers. Once he got back to the UK, he asked his wife to play that on the piano, to which she could not do. The moments immediately after that was absolutely breath taking. It gives a huge insight to how much they loved each other. When the wife was asked if she ever loved him, she replied, ""I loved you since Casablanca,"" fighting back tears of great sadness and guilt. The movie ended with him finding out the whole situation and helping his wife, who agreed to sell out who she is working with in order to stay with him and their daughter. At the very end, the allied forces finds out their agenda and started to chase after them, resulting with them almost escaping in a plane. But before they could escape, they were trapped by the allied forces, who were demanding for his wife to surrender. He, obviously loving her, wouldn't let her do it. But the only other option would be to either die or escape. Knowing their options, the wife decided to surrender so that her husband and her daughter could survive. It ended with her killing herself so that her husband won't be tried for treason.This movie really takes a toll on your emotions. It really brings you on a giant rollercoaster ride. If you didn't know how it would turn out, this movie really would leave a mark on you. From the incredible plot to the amazing acting, this movie really makes this story a wonder that has to be watched in order to be able to be enjoy it to the fullest. Just me telling you how it turned out does no justice for the masterpiece that it is. All i have to say is that it is a movie you must watch.Many of the reviews base their criticisms off of the fact that this film was not ""historically accurate"" but, i mean, it's a MOVIE, not a DOCUMENTARY where it has to historical accurate. Almost all of the bad reviews had a segment where they said something about how this one scene was not historically accurate or the absurdity of the time line of the movie. Also they also talk about how the logic of the movie in general doesn't make sense in comparison to reality. I mean like the movie didn't say that it would be nonfiction, and along with every other movie thats not a documentary, it usually is fiction. So all of their dumb criticisms just go down the drain due to the stupidity of their review in relation to the movie.Many movie critics just critiques on the smallest and most insignificant things, they never focus on the big pictures and all of the points where the movie was expetional in."
" Can't be shown to a Non-American audience
",2018-02-05 00:00:00,7,"Love both lead actors. Love the love story... However, it is impossible to believe for a second that the Brad Pitt character is either from Paris!!!!!! or a French Canadian or, for that matter an English Canadian (from Ontario) who learned Quebecois French. No french word coming out of Brad Pitt's mouth will cut it anywhere in the francophone world. If watched in English (as opposed to dubbed), major points will be lost around the world...Morocco included"
" Sort of a Film Noir version of Casablanca
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,6,"The film has a great look to it. The sets and costumes and props all look appropriate for the era. And the overall feel of the movie is just about perfect. But there just doesn't seem to be enough story to go with all that. 
You have a basic story of divided loyalties and love gone wrong and the cruelty of war, yada, yada, and a predictable ending. 
The action scenes are well done, though they strain credulity as any super-hero movie would. The good guys always come out unscathed and all the bad guys die, but it is a movie, after all. 
Brad Pitt does a good job and now looks the part for more mature roles, his boyish face finally starting to show some age.
So, yeah, it's worth a look, but the ending is somewhat unsatisfying, and the whole story is just a couple of clicks short of being really interesting."
" This Was Sad
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)Like a roller coaster you've ridden many times, this is still enjoyable, even though it has a typical story arc with the expected devices to ratchet up the emotions. Set in 1942 in Morocco, the story revolves around Canadian soldier (Pitt) and a female member of the French Resistance both of whom team up for a significant assassination attempt. During their preparation, of course, romantic feeling take hold. Yet being important operatives, there are hidden or undisclosed factors that come to roost at inopportune times. Will there relationship survive? Will they each survive the war? The conflict between the two arrives with ample time to hold the uneasy tension for quite some time toward the end and keeps you wondering how or will there be a resolution to their situation. It did a nice job of keeping the viewer emotionally involved. Overall, this was a high quality production with several explosive scenes coupled with solid acting while being fairly formulaic. Certainly watchable."
" Jin-Roh is better

If you didn't watch Jin-Roh, stop wasting your life and go watch it. And then maybe watch this one. Maybe."
" Something about Zemeckis
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,5,"I always thought of Robert Zemeckis as a hit or miss director. I hated Beowulf but I loved Death Becomes Her for instance. Allied falls right in the middle. An old fashion WWII drama and when I say old fashion I mean, musty, tired. Mr and Mrs Smith territory but with the major plus of Marion Cottillard. She is wonderful. Brad Pitt, who I love, looked like a special effect and being in a Robert Zemeckis movie I thought that he might be. Very strange. The simple premise of discovering that your spouse is not who you thought she was, opens a world of dramatic opportunities but there is something about Robert Zemeckis that makes me think he doesn't really care about the human interaction, no. he seems, always, much more focus in the special effects. Allies is no exception and in fact it has a couple of breathtaking visual coups. Unfortunately the actual drama left me completely cold."
" good ww ii spy thriller

" Action and Romanticism

" Embassy party and escape to London
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,8,This part of the movie is not credible. The party was full of German and Vichy Officers. Pitt and Cotillard enter the building with two machine guns and kill everyone! There were no German guards controlling access. After doing this they easily escape and fly to London.
" Fine WW 2 spy drama

The second half loses a bit of steam as the action shifts to London. Pitt is good while Cotillard gives an enigmatic performance that deserves to be seen. They work well together.
" Awful
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,2,"This movie is awful.....just awful. Did I mention it's awful.Is this the 1940s or did WW II take place in the 21st century? Lesbians in uniform hanging on each other and kissing in front of a superior officer? Homosexuality was illegal in England at that time.Really, a party in 1940s England where people were acting more like they were at a 1970s frat party. Men in uniform snorting coke? Sexual behavior right out in the open. Apparently the film makes didn't bother to educate themselves on human behavior in the UK during WW II, or they just didn't care.The story itself has dozens of holes. Sex in a car in the middle of a sandstorm? How did they manage to dig themselves out of the sand? The British military allowing the Pitt character to investigate his own wife? Sudden death if she was guilty?.....that didn't happen during WWII, the British would have tried to turn her into a double agent. Don't even get me started on the time-line of the war and how inaccurate the movie is.If you like sappy, awful war movies this one is for you."
" Ails from its boring and slow-pace
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,5,"""Allied"" has tons of talent that simply disappoints. Brad Pitt was surprisingly absolutely wooden in this film, frustrating me throughout. The chemistry in the romance between him and Marion Cotillard was not genuine at all, and felt fake. Pitt's bland performance left Cotillard as the one and only star of the film, but she does not benefit from low screen time, as the story is all about Max Vatan (Brad Pitt). Director Robert Zemeckis creates a love story to the classic film ""Casablanca"" but in the end becomes a wanna-be of sorts. There are too many scenes in the film that try to convince the audience over and over again that the romance between Pitt and Cotillard is real, but continually feels insincere. The plain and predictable third act does not relieve the film one bit, showing that the film could have been cut in half and still met its same end. It's slow, old-fashioned, and bores the audience frequently. ""Allied"" is not good or bad, just mediocre, which let me down completely, as I was expecting a classic wartime story."
" one wrong turn after another
",2017-11-28 00:00:00,3,"I'm surprised at the number of positive reviews of this film, like it's on par with Casablanca or something, because frankly,this movie is garbage. Weak acting, weak dialogue and a very weak story at best.The movie did have decent potential, but it seemed to take a wrong turn every chance it got. The acting is bland and uninspired, they appear to be forcing themselves through it just for the paycheck with no real interest or investment in the characters they are portraying. In Brad Pitt's defense, he can deliver strongly with the right character in the right movie ( Fight Club, Snatch, Inglorious Bastards ) but this wasn't a good character for him to begin with. He has about as much zest as a statue in this role, and it doesn't help that his (alleged) Botox enhancements make him look like he's having a bad anaphylactic reaction to some peanuts or shellfish. The story was about as poorly constructed as you can get. It was so ridiculous and implausible that any suspension of disbelief one needs to watch a fictitious movie goes right out the window. The basic plot itself is ludicrous....His superiors want him to kill his own wife and mother of his child after they confirm she is a spy? Really? Yeah, because nothing could go wrong with that strategy, right? Please. Now, I'm no military intelligence operative, but I'm pretty sure that's about the last strategy they would use in a situation like that. And it doesn't get any better after that bomb is dropped, either. The ending was especially poor....they could have chosen about a hundred different ways to end this movie, but just like all the nonsense before it, they did it in the worst way possible. Meant to be a tear jerker, it was so absurd it was laughable instead.A few simple story and plot changes and this could have been a much, much better movie than it was. Instead it's a ridiculous dumpster fire. Skip this mess and watch Casablanca instead."
" Decent movie with at least on tired trope
",2017-11-27 00:00:00,7,"This is an overall decent film with admittedly one tired trope of the babysitter played by Marion Bailey who starts off as a sweet Britsh lady, who when she is discovered as a spy suddenly lets go with a Geman accent. As if she spent all that time perfecting a perfect British accent that once caught, decides she can be herself, This is an old an tired old cliché from 40's movies that I had hoped would never again happen. Oh well."
" Good movie, well acted, fatal flaw.
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,6,"The story is enjoyable and very well acted, poignant as a spy genre film, but not thought through at key parts. The most egregious is the key scene in which Max (Brad Pitt) is given the instructions to potentially trap his wife as a German spy. He is to get and leave on his desk, planted information from a phone call. If she transfers that information, the British will know and he is to kill his wife. If he fails to do so, he will be noted to be an accomplice and will be hung for high treason. If the information is not transferred, ""all this will be forgotten"". It almost makes sense, but not quite. If he and his wife are spies, he need only tell his wife and not transfer the information - hence ""all would be forgotten"". Oops."
" A major disappointment from a great director
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,4,"240: Allied. This comes from the great Robert Zemeckis who made Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, two of my favorite movies of all time. He recently came back to live action filmmaking after his stint in motion capture. He made Flight and The Walk and now we come to Allied. Allied is about two people who meet in Morocco on a secret mission, they fall in love and get married. He later learns that she might be a spy for the German army. It has a very Hitchcock vibe to it. Or at least it tries to. It is an old fashioned kind of movie where it focuses more on the dynamics between their relationship. Even though it seems to be fairly thorough, it lacks something making the audience believe in their feelings for one another. It is an extreme slow burn of a movie and each character is hiding something so it seems like they're closed off from the rest of the world or nothing is real from them. Sadly I have to report that this was a slog to sit through. It moves really like sap pouring out of a tree. Brad Pitt for most of the time is a non entity. He seems to be entirely too stoic until the very end when we finally see some passion ignite in him that might have been helpful all along. It's just too slow. Most people will easily lose interest in this and I can't say that I blame them. I give this movie a D."
" Excellently Directed with a Stupid Storyline
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,4,"I watched the first hour of this movie, and although it was beautifully photographed and well-directed, it seemed to move very slowly for an espionage movie. Something about it didn't ring true, so I read the summary and quit watching the rest.The first tip-off is the surname given to Brad Pitt: ""Vatan"". This movie is set during WWII. How many wing commanders in 1942 would have had a Turkish or Iranian name in England at that time? The name given to the co- star in the film is ""Beausejour"" meaning ""beautiful stay"". I ask, ""Did the writers intend that this name should have some significance?"" I couldn't figure it out. As other reviews may tell you, a totally obnoxious executive from the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) tells Vatan that his wife is a German spy. And if Vatan is not prepared to expose his wife, we see the SOE guy open a drawer with a gun in it, implying that he was prepared to kill Vatan on the spot. Here comes the illogical part, as I give away the essence of the end of the film.Vatan and Beausejour are now living in London and they have a one year old daughter, Anna. It turns out that the Germans threatened Beausejour with harming their daughter if she didn't spy for them. She kept this a secret from her husband, and the movie proceeds from there to its depressing conclusion. Now, I ask you, ""What would happen logically in real life?"" The wife would tell her husband of the German threat who would then relate this to his superior, and they all would wind up working with the SOE on how to have Beausejour fool the Germans with meaningless British ""intelligence"". (Another issue was raised to which I did not find the answer. SOE claimed that Vatan's wife wasn't the real Beausejour.)The excitement in a more logical movie would revolve around the issue of ""How long can the British continue to fool the Germans and not have something dire happen to the child, Anna?"" I think that could be a much more intelligent movie which would move along at a faster pace."
" So tense, so intriguing... **NO SPOILERS**
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,9,Really excellent film. Loved this from start to finish.The tension is at times almost unbearable - up there with Bryan Cranston in The Infiltrator.Brad Pitt & Marion Cotillard were really good. I'm not a Brad Pitt fan but he really was top notch in this. The scenes in London's blitz were highlights too. They looked spectacular.This really is a good World War II film and I can't recommend it highly enough. Very solid 9 out of 10 for me
" Pleasantly surprised.
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,8,"Oh know I hear you say, another WWII movie... Yes it was, but Bill Clinton saw more action in his office than was in this movie. The action was deliberate, concise, and well executed to not be the main feature of the movie but lay the foundation of what would be an unbreakable bond for the rest of the story. It sounds a little cliché, and to a degree it is but it works.With an amazingly well setup wardrobe, subtle scenes, and body language that screams intimacy the opening scenes really captivated me and I didn't even know it had grabbed me. It really brought me into the espionage life for the period but it was not over played with massive drama, or super spy scenes, it was subtle, covert, to a point even calm nothing to tense. The middle was a little sluggish, and that is where the modern values crept into a period movie. It has almost become a part of every TV series and movie to have an open gay couple as if TV and movies are trying to prove something about diversity. Sigh....But where it all came together was the ending, I thought I knew... hell I even hoped for the best... but it was the visual and emotional strike that I have to say was what blew me away. So much so it had me asking personal questions for some time afterwards.I loved this movie, yes there could have been improvements... ie Pitts French... aghhhh... but overall pretty happy I took the time not only to watch it, but to believe it too."
" Average film with nonsensical plot
",2017-11-15 00:00:00,4,"As a fan of WW2 films I have to say this is the second time Mr Pitt has appeared in a period film with an idiotic plot SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS So Brad goes to Morocco on a secret mission, he is apparently French Canadian but speaks like um Brad Pitt.He connects with a major french spy, an aging Ms Cottiliard, who he has no photo of and has never seen ( why? ) - and they proceed to murder the German ambassador in the most ridiculously planned operation of the war.Fast forward and he marries her and then a year later ( after many air raids that take place long after the BoB ??? ) they are living well when Brad is called to the office and told she is a spy for the Nazi's - well maybe, we'll know on Monday so take the weekend off but don't investigate this matter! Oh - by the way, if she is guilty YOU have to kill her yourself ( um - why? ) So shockingly Brad investigates the crap out of the matter and in doing so gets a fellow spy killed, blabs to his lesbian sister and eventually kills several Nazi spy's in London ( no need to try to turn them, to get them to feed false info to the boys in Berlin, maybe save a few thousand lives in Normandy - no sirree - Brad shoots em! ) Then he tries to escape with the wife but is stopped at the airfield, when she shoots herself and then FIN Utterly stupid"
" Given Some Thought, the Plot Is A Bit Senseless
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,7,"I saw this film on TV. I liked it but never thought it was a classic. Afterwards, I gave the plot some thought. It did not quite add-up. The problems begin when the British discover that there is a spy in their midst. The spy is female and married to Brad Pitt's character who is a patriotic, Canadian underground agent. When the spy is discovered, Pitt is directed to kill his wife or it will be assumed that Pitt himself must be a spy.This puts the characters in an interesting no-good-way-out dilemma, but alas, it is a scenario that doesn't make a lot of sense. Does the act of Pitt's character killing his wife really prove that he too isn't a spy? But the thing I wondered about was: why shouldn't the British use the Nazi spy to their own advantage by peddling false information to the Nazis? Maybe that will be in a sequel. Sure, that's it."
" So much at stake and it remains superficial and manipulative rather than deeply moving
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,6,"Allied (2016)A dramatic (and sometimes dramatic to the point of parody) telling of one spy and then another, and how they fall in love. The leading actors are great starting points, Brad Pitt as the Canadian dropping into Morocco and Marion Cotillard as his contact after his arrival. And here's the biggest problem right away—they have no real chemistry, and are actually not given much to work with (besides an absurd but fun love scene in a sandstorm).You get the feeling everyone is trying to outdo ""Casablanca"" itself, and they even start the movie there, just in case you don't feel the romance in the air. Robert Zemeckis is a storytelling director, so it's surprising this doesn't quite take off (blame the writer, in part?) but he's also not a lyrical film director. He depends on flash and surprise (as in ""Back to the Future,"" which is not a subtle film, whatever else it has that is brilliant).And in fact, ""Allied"" is an unsubtle film that needs some nursing along, some ambiance rather than over-the-top drama. (The birth scene will either be astonishing or laughable, depending on how involved in the movie you are. A little of both, maybe.) The story itself I think had great potential, but the actual screenplay dumbs it down.And if Cotillard is brilliant in her role (which she has to be, as you'll see), Pitt is a little wooden, downplaying the energy he might have brought to it. Here I suspect he's been told to channel Bogart with an understated intensity, and oddly enough, he just can't do it. (Blame the cinematography, a little, because as slick and beautiful as it is, it is also the work of an action flick mentality, rather than an actual romantic drama.)I watched it with real interest all the way and enjoyed many parts of it. I enjoyed even more anticipating what might be next, because there were a couple of plot twists at work. But each time I was a bit disappointed in what actually took place, the pulling of punches, or the sentimentalizing rather than dramatizing. When it was done, looking back, it seems like a stream of missed opportunities and imperfect scenes sandwiched between other moments that could have take us far.If the two of them had some actual chemistry in the first place."
" Better then I thought it would be
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,8,"To me it's surprisingly a good movie considering it's a romantic movie. Those are normally not the movies I go for. Well romance is a big word because there is also plenty of action, as it is also a war movie. The best part of the movie is the chemistry between Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. Starting as a casual professional encounter it grows deeper as the movie goes on. Without revealing anything about the movie their relationship gets rocky at one point due to certain circumstances. At this part there are some interesting intrigues that make you want to see the rest of the movie to get answers. The cast of the movie is just top notch. Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard have nothing to prove anymore. They are both great actors and in Allied it just shows. The action scenes and all the rest of the movie are very well shot. It couldn't be more professional. A good story, great acting, everything you want when you watch a movie. Certainly worth a watch."

After learning that Mariane is accused of being a Nazi double agent, Max will secretly get involved in the investigation to prove her innocence.This Paramount Picture received mixed reviews from most critics, but Pitt and especially Cotillard's performances were praised. Pitt appears to grow haggard as the film progresses. A few minutes over two hours run time is no reason to nix this one."
" worth watching, but only once
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,6,"The Pitt - Cotillard duo works well and shows considerable chemistry. Cotillard, one of the most beautiful women in movies, lights up the screen with enough charm and sensuality to tempt an eremite saint, aided and abetted by one of the most exquisite wardrobes seen these last years. (I do hope that someone got an Oscar for the costumes. The wedding dress alone deserves a place in a museum.)However, it might have been better if some of the imagination and care lavished on the costumes had been spared for other aspects. The movie, for all its burning airplanes and multicolored explosions, isn't all that gripping, thrilling or moving. It isn't even all that convincing. For instance : try wrapping your head around the idea of seasoned intelligence and counterintelligence officers going on about top secret matters while surrounded by a loud and chaotic party of the more bohemian kind. Who discusses capital secrets within possible earshot of unsuccessful young poets trying to pour cheap sherry down your neck ? Moreover, it's a pretty good bet that such people didn't discuss crucial safety matters with their sisters, however sensible or brave or patriotic these sisters may have been. Still, we should all be thankful that the depiction of intelligence work isn't all that realistic : if the various Allied espionage and counterespionage services had thought and behaved like that in real life, then the swastika flag would be flying in every country from Arctica to Antarctica... Fun note : the linguists among you can enjoy a wide range of accents and pseudo-accents, some of which are so unhinged that they belong in a psychiatric ward. Sadly this fact doesn't count towards an extra star, although the line about ""Your French is good, but your accent isn't Parisian enough"" is comedy gold."
" Interesting war story concept, but there was something off about it
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,6,"Casablanca, Germans, spies, La Resistance... how can you fail with that? Well, something about Allied was off, whether it was the chemistry between the actors or the long setup before anything actually happens or simply the bleak and understated finale. I don't know what I didn't like, I just know that it was a movie I expected more of until it ended and left me disappointed.Now, I can't say Brad Pitt didn't act well, but I am so used with his smiling persona that I felt the icy spy role didn't fit him, made him look old and sick. Marion Cotillard was OK, but something in her acting threw me off at almost every scene. Jared Harris was awesome as always, but didn't have much of a role.The only thing remaining to discuss is the story, and I can't spoil it here. It's intriguing and I believe it could have been developed into something more intense and interesting. As such, it was a movie with mostly exposition and very little character development."
" Great for Westland Lysander fans!
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,7,"We didn't like this film too much, though it was entertaining most of the time and well-made in terms of costumes, colours and London WW2 ""feeling"". Brad Pitt was, as in many movies, distant and nowhere near great acting. It's Pitt in different clothes and with different names. His love for Cotillard - who fits her part well - is neither convincing nor deepened, and works strange all the time. When it gets towards showdown, this lack of explanation tears the movie apart. BUT: many thanks to the director for portraying a real WW2 hero, the Westland Lysander! Aircraft fans wouldn't want to miss this!"
" Doesn't ring true
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,5,"Its hard to pinpoint what was out of kilter with Allied as the basic story had potential. Perhaps it was the over glamorous look, a prettied up version of the time period and location. Plus the 2 main characters were just so unbelievable as spies. The clothing, the silly card shuffle scene,the quick flight to and from France, the way they too easily manage to shoot all the Germans chasing them. A Boys Own view of a hero spy? As for the swearing and lesbian characters, so historically out of place and very clunky as a result. Directors may get a kick out of filming a lesbian kiss but it wouldn't have taken place so publicly in that time period and strange but true not everyone ran around saying the ""f"" word then. I do like love stories but this never felt true, it was all too cardboard cut-out and contrived. My favourite actor was the baby, just beautiful! Sorry but I was looking forward to a good story and was very disappointed. It came across as an American version of what they thought second world war spies should have been like rather than any attempt at accuracy, so had an almost ""spoof"" feel to it."
" Allied
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,8,"Allied depicts historical events during WWII. Even parachuting into Morocco. I am not disappointed with this film but enjoy its plausibility because I have studied clandestine operations conducted by the French and British. These characters roles ring true. Keeping ones cover is paramount-the romance and falling in love are possible. Remember Pitt's character had flown to France to supply the Resistance so he was involved with ongoing military interventions. Pitt is no Humprey Bogart but he's a definitive actor that maintains notability in each of his films. Provided Marion takes the spotlight - remember a co-star down playing their role elevates these interactions. Many military attaches' were rotated in the European theater for purposes of keeping their covers intact. The scene where Pitt kills the Nazi officer because his cover was blown speaks to this. Marion's character has an excellent arch-being a counter spy blackmailed into continuing to protect their child. Sophie's Choice twist.The plot speaks to why spies ought not to fall in love, the risk and lies they live out catch up to the truth sooner or later. ""Both people f' each other and now they're dead"" Pitts line-referring to what happens when spy's fall in love-at the breakfast table. Script and plot points are in sync. Music is balanced. A seamless edit.In a world of SS Nazi suspicion of everyone - civilian men must act reserved to save their skin; beautiful women can be flamboyant.Especially when it comes to cutting the deck... metaphorically speaking.""Max, you're a bloody fool."" Tag line.Allied accomplishes subtlety which is the spy game genre."
" Posturing...
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,4,"Is she? Isn't she? Will he? Won't he? Most importantly: Who cares?It has all the surface accoutrements of a decent spy film... but the one major element it lacked for me was authenticity, which is quite important in espionage!I never for one second believed that these big movie stars were the characters they played, even when all cover was dropped, and they were striving for genuine emotion... An expensive storefront window with nothing of value behind it, this is Pitt's version of Jolie's ""The Tourist"" - lavish, and pointlessly hollow... (although I enjoyed ""The Tourist"", at least, since it made no pretense at being anything BUT flighty).I expected better from Zemeckis, but too long spent in the uncanny valley of Motion-Capture Land has obviously dulled his senses, and left him unable to inject real soul into a movie that's ostensibly grounded in reality."
" Play it again Marianne
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,9,"Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) is a Canadian intelligence officer on a classified mission in Casablanca. Here he meets French resistance fighter Marianne Beauséjour (Marion Cotillard) working undercover in the German embassy. She poses as his wife as they get close. After a successful mission, they go to London, get married and have a child. Later, as D-Day approaches, security and secrecy becomes an issue that effects their life.Yes, I agree Angelina would have been better in the female lead, if not more interesting. Max has a lesbian sister, also working in London. It didn't add anything to the film, but for some reason Hollywood felt they needed to add it. The acting was top notch. The ending I didn't see coming, nor was it on my short list. The sadness of the film of love, life, sacrifice, and the greater good perhaps plays into the audience partial rejection as it leaves a bitter taste in their mouths.Guide: F-word, sex, brief side breast nudity."
" Surprisingly Bad.
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,4,"It's been a long time since there has been a decent movie with war in the backdrop. We've been getting lots of ""Hacksaw Ridges"" and ""The Hurt Lockers"" where the battles are first and foremost but very little human greatness outside of the battlefield. If there have been recent movies with war in the backdrop, they are too far in the back to be remembered. Robert Zemeckis' Allied looked like it would be and ode to Casablanca and have the war in the just right spot. Well, it tried, and it failed.Brad Pitt plays a Canadian resistance dude assigned to Casablanca, Morocco. The year is 1942 and I thought it would have been awesome of there was an allusion to the old film. I really wanted Marion Cotillard to say ""Rick Blaine has letters of transit,"" or Pitt say ""I have a meeting with Victor Lazlo."" That would have been awesome. So Brad is paired with Marion Cotillard on a mission to assassinate a German ambassador. Posing as husband and wife, both people get to know each other and live the part out for awhile. The romance is pretty shallow, like when James Bond romances a girl. That's the level that this movie achieves.After the assassination, they get married in real life and have a child. A year passes and Pitt is told that his wife is a German spy. He is determined to prove them wrong and get to the bottom of it. This second act is indeed better than the first. It is interesting to see Pitt investigate his wife's mysterious past. But again, this never reaches the full potential. There was so much room in so many places for so many smart twists and turns. What results is a super generic explanation with the journey to the truth only being interesting, not awesome.Perhaps it would have been better if the characters were developed better. All we get to know is that Brad is Canadian and Marion Cotillard is a German with a past. Boom! I just told you everything you need to know about the characters.Are there any good things? Sure. The action is good and production design are all top notch. And, as I said, the investigating is interesting. But none of these could have saved an overall bad movie with an even worse ending.2/4"
" Another Hollywood take on wartime
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,6,"Visually this film is a treat. The Moroccan (in reality Gran Canarian) landscape, the blitz scenes and leafy Hampstead all look great. Oh and of course the actors; Pitt definitely looks better with age, the blue-eyed prettiness of youth having given way to a chiselled-jaw handsomeness. Cotillard is chocolate box perfection, glamorously beautiful in every scene. The acting is generally good, although a little hammy in bits, particularly from Pitt who veers a bit too far into Top Gun territory at some points but I think the script is primarily the culprit here, and in fact the script is probably the weakest part of this film. Well, that and the plot which doesn't really make sense ... particularly towards the end where I think it's far more likely that the British would have turned the situation to their advantage with the D Day mission just round the corner. There is a fair bit of silliness in this film. Although swearing is nothing new, the F word was not in common use in 1940's Britain, and would have attracted disapproving looks as a minimum, particularly if used in mixed company. Homosexuality is as old as time itself but in Britain at least it was kept mainly behind closed doors until fairly recently, so the openly lesbian sister and her lover was an unlikely (and somewhat unnecessary) touch - although I have to correct a previous reviewer who commented on homosexuality being illegal during this period. It was indeed illegal in Britain during this period, but was defined as sexual relations between men. Lesbianism was not recognised in British law, so it would be social, rather than legal, factors which made this unlikely. Open displays of same sex affection might have occurred at the more bohemian London parties but definitely not in the pub! The same can also be said for drugs and sex. Yes, these things all happened and yes wartime and the threat of imminent destruction made people more reckless but what the director ignores is British social attitudes at that time and which prevailed for several decades thereafter. Despite the negatives this is an enjoyable film and very watchable. It's Hollywood trying to do history which rarely works, so as a period piece this is a fail, but it's entertaining enough."
" Movie spoiled with modern details
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,4,"This movie was showing lots of promise and was an enjoyable story until the producer or director decided to throw in a gratuitous scene with two lesbians kissing and some cocaine-snorters, which wrecked the movie. These details did nothing to add to the story, nor did they have anything whatsoever to do with the story. It seems that this addition was just another attempt to normalize homosexuality in the minds of viewers. In 1940s England lesbians were firmly in the closet and would NEVER kiss romantically in public. Nor would Londoners openly snort cocaine at a public party. Adding these details destroyed any feeling that you were experiencing life in the 1940s, thus destroying the credibility of the movie. It seems that every movie or serial show these days feels compelled to have openly homosexual characters, and frankly I'm sick of it. I would otherwise have rated this movie a 7."
" Disappointing propaganda
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,1,"I just watched "" allied"" yesterday on Netflix. I was frustrated. The movie portray Brad Pitt as an almost super human hero, capable of killing so many professional and heavily armed soldiers on his own. Normally when you are outnumbered, at least you get hurt, but not him. He makes German soldiers look incompetent, stupid and useless (if they were that weak, how come it took 6 years of fighting to defeat them?). Marion Cotillard is supposed to be a German woman pretending to be French. How come she leaves a letter to her daughter in a language that is not her first (German) or even second (French). It would make more sense if the movie showed some of her German traits that would make it more plausible that she was not who she claimed to be.There is a scene that is quite cruel, when Brad Pitt executes half a dozen injured German soldiers who were not a threat anymore (the rules of the engagement normally says that you make them prisoners of war). The Canadian and British army was famous for not being ruthless with their prisoners (different than Russians for example). Normally they would shoot to kill when in combat, but there are hardly cases of war crimes and merciless, sadistic killing. That didn't seemed historically accurate.Then, there are the handlers, a very old lady (Mrs. Sinclair) and another old jeweler, who are murdered without being judged by the proper authorities (they probably could be hanged, but normally you interrogate them first, since they can collaborate and snitch on more secret agents in UK).I felt that Robert Zemeckis wanted to make a movie about good guys versus bad guys, but he just couldn't convince me that some French citizens in Morocco, who tried to get along with their occupied government (the Vichy Republic) deserved to be killed for that. I felt more compassion than pleasure for their deaths."
" Wasn't what I was expecting....
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,7,"Spoilers ** Spoilers **Spoilers ** belowPerformances were good all around. Keep your hand on the FF button, unless you want to see gratuitous groping and moaning (I don't). Nice period piece. Brad, a highly-ranked espionage agent in World War II, with a pilot background, gets hooked up with the Marian Cotillard character, pulling a dangerous coup in Morocco, and then escaping to safety in Britain, where they marry. As you're aware, allegations are made to Brad that his bride (and the mother of a new child) is, in fact, a spy, planted in Africa by the Germans, as a replacement for a legit French freedom fighter who was executed. Brad has reason to suspect his mettle is just being tested.** Don't read below unless you've seen it **Spoilers ** Spoilers **Spoilers ** and plot questions 1> why didn't Marianne change sides, once she got to Britain? Confess, and switch sides? The Gestapo had less assets than the Brits in England, if things went sour -- she could have been a great double-agent, passing bad info onto the Gestapo. lived happily ever after. when she finally owned up, she showed that she was a self-serving schemer. Sorry - it's a hard world. There are prices to pay for lying--and betrayal.2> she (finally) gives herself away by not being able to play the piano like the real person. No decent Espionage outfit would commit an oversight like that. The Gestapo would have gotten her lessons up front, or, maybe on the sly in U.K. once she settled there, in case the subject ever came up. With 3 weeks practice, I could play La Marseillaise convincingly. It ain't a recital at Albert Hall.Apart from that, I am impressed that the production team didn't script a typical clichéd happy ending. Even if she goes for option 1 above, you could still deliver a tragic conclusion by having a German agent finally 'get to her' (lethally). It's just that her character didn't strike me as a German patriot - hence, I can't buy that she would jeopardize her new life, just to pass low grade info to the Axis side, which, by 1944, was obviously going to lose anyway."
" Superb!!!
",2017-08-18 00:00:00,10,"The Netflix summary sounded like it might be a good movie so we brought it up. It is a SUPERB movie that captures the atmosphere of world war II with powerful staging and creative cinematography. Basically it is the story of a Canadian-British spy who falls in love with his French partner in espionage who might just be a double agent. (I'll never tell whether she was.) I was dismayed to see the long list of errors on the IMDb page, such things as non-contemporary door locks, misplaced deserts and inappropriate salutes. Usually I'm a stickler for such things. But this movie is so great, they don't really matter. You'll be riveted to your chair for its two hour plus running time. The plot is almost operatic. They have captured wartime London, the blitz and the flexible wartime morality of the forties brilliantly. A| winner and a keeper!"
" Unfortunate errors for a nice movie
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,5,"Watching this with someone who was of age during this time period was extremely enlightening.The use of all the F-bombs was unwarranted and not common at the time. The public cameo of the lesbian sister was typical of progressive intervention in all things Hollywood, but also, not common at the time, even in Europe. Some older English viewers will also have a problem with the portrayals.Overall watchable but slow."
" Interesting WWII story
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,6,"From one humble Christian's perspective...Language level: 5 out of 5 High-level profanity is used all throughout the film.Sexual level: 5 out of 5 Some sex scenes and a topless woman is shown.Violence level: 4 out of 5 There are airplanes being shot down, guns being used, etc.Personal Thoughts: An interesting historical drama concerning WWII, about love, espionage, war."
" Logically and Historically Absurd
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,2,"This movie is full of stylish and attractive film-making, but the story is ridiculously unbelievable. It opens in ""french Morocco"" in 1942. In November of 1942, French Morocco was invaded and conquered by US and UK forces. The assassination of the German ""Ambassador"" - there were no diplomatic relations between ""Morocco"" and Germany at the time - was carried out by our movie's heroes: Max and Marianne. They escape to England, marry, and have a girl child named Anna. When we see the happy family later, Anna is at least one year old. The movie must now be in - at least- early 1944. At that time, there were no German spies in England, or Scotland,Wales, or Northern Ireland, either. All had been identified, jailed, or turned. See Masterman, 1972. Had Marianne raised her hand, and said, ""I am a German spy,"" she would have been welcomed into the Allied intelligence network. Even had she not, there would have been no evidence against her. Meh, movie; terrible history."
" Typically lazy effort
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,4,"OK, I don't often write reviews but I felt compelled to, this time. I mean what a waste of talent and money! Jees... Come on people cinema is supposed to be art. You must have something to say, to convey. A story, a feeling, a thesis, something. It's not producing clothes-hangers damn it. It's not like filling a tax return (although that can get challenging...) You must put a little heart into it.TRESPASSERS BEWARE: MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS! Back to the case at hand. Just some of the things gone wrong in the first 15minutes:OK, so they decide to have the spy parachute down in the desert. Put aside that this is a bit contrived (I mean he has all the papers and acts the part good enough to fool high ranking nazi -is spellcheck really making me capitalize nazi? No thank you sir- officers couldn't he just travel like other people?) it is an impressive scene. Until you realize that it is blatantly computer generated. I mean that's expected in Transformers 4 but here it just kills the mood right of the bat. Get some sand in your shoes people!He meets his co-spy/pretend wife in a crowded bar with all her friends at the same table and nazi officers all around. What a great idea! Shouldn't they have met in their apartment and gotten their stories straight first? But that would kill the tension right? Well knock your heads together and come up with a more plausible idea!Supposedly after not having seen his young wife for months one is supposed to sleep alone on the roof following an old custom of the country he has just arrived in hours before. Otherwise we couldn't get that hushed people-might-be-listening conversation we get from the protagonists on the roof. You see where I am getting at here? Total audience manipulation. You just can't enjoy the movie when people are trying to pull your strings left and right.Then suddenly the movie goes all Jack Reacher on you when the spy kills a nazi silently in a cafe just feet away from whispering tea sippers. I never saw a guy fighting so weakly for his life as that pathetic nazi. Going down in seconds without even a kick or a scream? My wife fights back harder than that (and that is a proved fact)! Oh so neatly killed as to seem naturally chocked on a nut? Why not send this super spy directly after Hitler so we can get this whole WWII thing behind us already?The answer? Because he is the worlds best card shuffler, totally committed to his art as we see him dazzle a nazi officer in order to prove he is a card player as per his fake bio. Overzealous anyone?I really had to quit watching after that open air birth complete with air raids and bombs blowing up left and right. I don't know about you guys, but I have happened to witness a couple of births myself and women don't tend to make heartfelt speeches while their vaginas are being stretched out of proportion.I could go on and on about the acting and the historical and topographical inaccuracies etc, but other reviewers have those covered better than I could.I give it a 4/10 for production values."

The chemistry between Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard was convincing as they played their characters exceptionally. The winner here is the directing and writing - executed perfectly with great cinematography and editing. The pace was a little slow but the excellent ending made up for it! Very enjoyable and it's a 8/10 from me."
" Definitely be a film I will enjoy watching again and again.
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,9,"Overall, my general opinion for this film was very positive. I went in expecting nothing, and walked out feeling very satisfied. Sure the CGI and kinda slow first act took away from the overall experience, but even I didn't notice one of the two until someone pointed it out to me. The real star of the show was the acting and story, and In the end I decided to give Allied a ""Very Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 9 out of 10. This is probably one of the best films I've seen all year, and I honestly considered giving it a Golden V or a 10 out of 10. Definitely go out and see it if you haven't, as Allied will definitely be a film I will enjoy watching again and again.Read more at theVade."
" Good, but could've been great.
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,7,"Robert Zemeckis plunges us into the set of WWII in a very Casablanca style. Many scenes make you think of the Hollywood Golden-Age classic, although Allied is a much more dramatic movie that pictures the French collaborative Regime, Nazi Germany but also Canada, which is not a country that is usually represented in WWII pictures. Actually I think it's the first movie that I've seen that puts the Canadian side as protagonist. The photography is also very good. The shots that take place in the Moroccan desert, and in Morocco in a more general way, are precious. They have very refined aesthetics and a subtle symbolism. But the big problem of this movie is the chemistry between the two lead actors. Marion Cotillard and Brad Pitt may be great actors themselves but when both are together the chemistry just doesn't spark. The romantic scenes they share are just missing a ""je ne sais quoi"" that has a terrible impact on the movie. In my opinion it's what makes it a good movie but not a great one. It's really disappointing that so little impacts so much."
" Bad weaving of the plot which is unreasonable and disjointed, but has good setting
",2017-06-15 00:00:00,5,"If the German Nazis want to kill their own man who resists the Nazi regime, why they would choose a Canadian army person to kill their own man and taking so much troubles and risks to mislead the Canadian assassinator ?? Does not make any sense. Was the Nazi regime afraid of their own CNN or what ?? Or maybe so much afraid of their Human Rights organizations so they required such disguise ?? Just ridiculous !!!! The Nazis who murdered openly so many of their own men, suddenly turn so sensitive about killing 1 man of their own ??All the great intelligence agencies of the Allies don't have any clue about the above German plot. They don't notice the Nazi spyess is a fake Marianne Beauséjour and that she is misleading their own man in Casablanca. The Allies intelligence don't suspect how a known French resistant against Nazis befools the Germans so easily and becomes so trusted by the Germans. The Allies never heard the real Marianne Beauséjour is dead. The Allies don't have a clue the German ambassador is against the Nazi regime. The British intelligence screws up in checking the spyess background before approving her entrance to England. So, is this a new game of naivety & innocence or what ?? And then what justification they had to blame Max Vatan for marrying a German spyess ?? How could he know what his whole employing agency could not ?? For so many screw ups in such a short time, all the head intelligence officers should have been sacked immediately. The so brave German spyess who has balls to risk her own life in hostile places, suddenly loses them in a friendly place. She could easily desert and let the British intelligence know all the names of the German spies in England who jeopardize her. She would be pardoned and safeguarded. First the brave & tough Max Vatan rejects the spyess trials to seduce him. First he tells her to close the lousy buttons of her shirt when she tries to seduce him and explains her why it's not good to have such relationship being in duty. Later he makes a wild sex with her in the car. And finally he asks to marry her. So what the heck happened in between that caused such dedicated, rational and tough agent to flip flop with his personal feelings ?? Did just few smiles of her and her shooting abilities made this whole flip flopping difference ?? What did he see in her which we the audience could not ?? Do the movie makers conceal some top confidential secret about their spying couple ?? Please enlighten us. The war is over, Hitler is dead, the Allies won. So it's time to loosen up. The setting is usually very good, except in the opening when he parachutes in the desert, which looks like the parachuter and the setting is taken from a computer game."
" An absolutely ridiculous attempt at a WWII Epic
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,2,"I will not even bother to comment on the story line which could have been a very interesting and well made film if only the script were very interesting and well made. In a ham handed attempt to bring the reality of 1940's society into 2016 by streamlining a lesbian couple into the story line as if it would have been a perfectly normal and accepted situation to have a woman, Pitt's characters sister, in uniform at his wedding pawing all over her lesbian submissive lover, this is while sitting at the same table as the ""V"" Section Commander who doesn't seem to care that a military officer is engaged in a lesbian sexual encounter while under his command in an intelligence unit which would have required people who had absolutely no ""weakness"" which could have possibly been compromised. Then later in the film where their roles seem to reverse and she is the one being manhandled by her cellist lover. My complete disillusionment with this film isn't related to the idea that a Lesbian Couple was written into the script, it's how they were written into the script as if they were no longer living their lives in secrecy for the most part, and certainly not in the open within the British Military in 1940's Britain; the very idea is complete nonsense and a complete insult to those who lived alternative lifestyles prior to the societal acceptance of these alternative lifestyles. These people within the LGBT movement had worked decades for acceptance. This idiotic script totally discounts the years and the struggles which were so hard fought by so many. I am not a member of the LGBT community but I can't help but feel incensed by the dismissal of the actual trials which those who were living a Gay lifestyle during WWII. Then there is the lengths which Pitts character goes to in total disregard of his orders and the lives of a number of men behind enemy lines to have people look at his wife's picture; it is simply one of the dumbest story lines I have ever seen played out within a major motion picture that didn't include the launch of space craft full of Well Drilling pros which then land on a Comet headed for New York, and then are successful! That movie however was at least well done, which this wasn't. History is interesting and really doesn't require a ""rewrite""."
" Disappointment
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,3,A movie directed by Robert Zemeckis. Starring Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. The movie tells us a story of agents who met on a mission to kill German Ambassador in Casablanca during World War II and fall in love. After returning to London their relationship is tested. It was boring and predictable movie. I couldn't see the chemistry between main characters. And I was feeling a lack of something in the whole movie. I was expecting a lot from it but I was disappointed.
" love and duplicity
",2017-05-22 00:00:00,8,"Robert Zemeckis has mostly made audience-pleasing movies (I Wanna Hold Your Hand, Back to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Forrest Gump, Cast Away). He occasionally opts for more mature content, such as 2012's ""Flight"". ""Allied"" is of the latter nature, although like the former group it looks to the past for inspiration.Brad Pitt plays a Canadian intelligence officer during WWII who goes to Casablanca (where else?) to kill the German ambassador. While there he hooks up with Marion Cotillard's resistance fighter and they eventually get married. But once they move to England, he learns that there's something that he didn't know about her.The movie makes sure to set the stage with the era's music and costumes. But the most important part remains the moral dilemma that Pitt's character faces. It's not any sort of masterpiece, but the acting makes up for the movie's flaws. Much of the camera-work helps tell the story (notice the scene where Pitt looks at Cotillard in the mirror).Overall, I recommend it."
" A movie made the way they used to be!
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,9,"Allied is a GREAT movie. Run, don't walk, to see this one.Most of today's movies fall into one of two categories. The first is the ""big"" films with A-list stars, exotic locations, and endless CGI-sequences that try to compensate for the lack of plot and character development. The second is ""small"" films, often with A- list stars, and real plots and character development but with very modest production values.In contrast, Allied hearkens back to the days when Hollywood actually made ""Movies"" (with a capital M) that featured A-list actors, exotic locations, great stories, characters, suspense, romance, high production values and more!The story starts in Morocco (although filmed in the Canary Islands) and follows Brad Pitt, a Canadian intelligence office, and Marion Cotillard, a Resistance fighter, and is a bit reminiscent of Casablanca. After a very successful special mission, they develop a romantic relationship and move to London.All goes well until information surfaces that suggests Cotillard may actually be a German spy. If it turns out to be true, then – under the ""Intimate Betrayal Rule"" – Pitt must execute Cotillard himself, or face his own execution. I can't say more without giving too much away but the movie has lots of twists and turns and has an absolutely perfect ending.Pitt and Cotillard are excellent as is the large supporting cast.See it now."
" What they call a good movie in earlier times
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,10,"I liked the Film .It had the same feel but in a modern way, of the old fashion British type War films in the late 50 early 60 that when you came out of the Cinema you felt like you had spent your time and Money well and would be still talking about it later. One of the reasons I liked the film is because I was born and raised in in Central London FEB 1943, Plus the Plot, and familiar surroundings seemed to be right with the Actors doing a good job."
" Memories of Rick and Ilsa
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,7,"Although at first it looked like a cross between ""Casablanca and ""Inglourious Basterds"", ""Allied"" soon settles into an unusual and compelling romance.To enjoy this film set in WW2 you just have to go with it. During an operation in Casablanca, Canadian Max Vatan (Brad Pitt), a British Intelligence agent, falls in love with a beautiful French resistance fighter, Marianne Beauséjour (Marion Cottillard). Back in England they marry and have a baby. However, it turns out she could be a spy. And so it goes until an ending that leaves Brad about as desolate as he was in ""Se7en"".The film attempts to capture the feeling of those romantic adventure films that were actually made during WW2; films it must be said that were as much removed from reality as this one is. When Max fakes his way onto a plane to pop over to Nazi Occupied France to prove a point, it's not too far removed from the sort of thing Errol Flynn got up to in war movies back in the 1940's.Brad is fine as the secret service agent although the script allows for a very cavalier approach to the supposedly secret stuff. However, along with Brad's style and charisma, Marion Cotillard's stillness and presence give ""Allied"" that big movie feel that elevates it from other WW2 dramas such as ""Foyles War"". Even if Max and Marianne don't quite reach the emotional heights of Rick and Ilsa, by the halfway mark we care what happens to them.Director Robert Zemeckis' composer of choice, Alan Sylvestri, contributed an atmospheric and emotive score. It has a more modern vibe than the sounds of those films of the 1940's with their wall-to-wall orchestral scores by maestros such as Steiner, Waxman, and Rozsa.Zemeckis wrings every drop of emotion out of his films – ""Contact"", ""Castaway"", ""Forrest Gump"" – and so he does with ""Allied"". Despite the implausibilities, the powerful love story drives the film."
" A good, if not spectacular film
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,5,"Brad Pitt could probably do this sort of film in his sleep, but full credit to the man, he does them well.This is a stylish and interesting film, that while isn't really anything we have seen before, is decent enough entertainment.The leads do their job, the script throws in a few surprises. I don't think anyone involved will say it's the best work that they've ever done, but it will entertain a lot of people.With decent films that aren't special effect heavy or part of a franchise in short supply, this film is a nice escape."
" Lovly moovie
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,9,"well in the era of movies with CGI and poor quality of stories. this film was one of the out standing ones that i have seen after along time.looking at others reviews its better that i saw the movie without watching the trailer, and ill recommend others to do the same if you have not seen it already."
" OK but plot falls flat
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,6,"Brad Pitt stars as Max Vatan, wing commander for a base in England. Years earlier he was sent into French Morocco to team up with another spy named Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard). As teasers show, they take on a suicide mission, end up falling in love and having a life together. Back in England, Vatan is told that his wife is a German spy, which is when the mystery starts - is she or isn't she. Unfortunately, it's also when the plot falls flat.I can think of so many other creative ways that this could have played out, so that your choice would be more than a simple yes or no. Especially based on how they escaped from Morocco. But helas, the plot ends up being very simple with only minor small periods of tension.Brad Pitt was OK, but he always seemed to be portraying someone who was unfeeling to everything. Cotillard was terrific, but again, i think she could only do so much with such a simple plot.The best part of the film was the cinematography with some terrific scenes of what bombing attacks at night were like. Costume design was also outstanding because both Pitt and Cotillard were stunning when dressed to the nines to go out. It's too bad that some of that design flair could not have been spun into the plot to make IT more interesting.6/10 at best is my rating. Allied is not terrible, but it's nothing special either. Enjoy."
" Mildly entertaining, but too many things wrong with the film
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,5,"The film is incredibly slow in the start. I wanted to bail at 30 minutes because it was not just slow, the plot was simply not moving. The movie could've started much later and you would not have missed much.The acting was quite bad. No chemistry whatsoever between the couple. Brad Pitt's French is beyond horrendous. People said that about his so called southern accent in Inglourious Basterds, but this is the first time I needed subtitles for French and I'm a French speaker. No, he does not sound like a Quebecer. Quebecers are not English speakers that speaker French horribly. They're native speakers who speak a dialect of French that does not exist in France anymore. They could've explained his accent in another way - that his mother was a French speaker, but she died when he was 10, so his French did not improve. Or that he was raised by a French family when he was a kid. Or any number of ways that one encounters in real life. Saying ""no, there's a place in Canada where everyone talks like that"" doesn't make any sense and I feel that it was added to get some bonus reference points from The English Patient.Cotilliard's English is, for some (not myself), a little hard to follow, but that's not a valid criticism. She plays a French woman. Making her fluent in English would not make sense.Casablanca. Again this was chosen as a nudge-nudge-wink-wink to some other film whose name I can't remember. But the film is not sure what it wants to be. It wants to be in Casablanca, which was a busy port city, but it also wants to be the English patient, with deserts and such. So it went down the middle - so there are random camel traders in the middle of a city, right in front of the German embassy. There are so many reasons why that's not likely (security perimeter, traffic, commandeering of animals/horses for the war effort, rationing, people eating the animals, etc), but the film doesn't care. If only there were resources or people that one could consult to make an accurate historical film. Something like photos or books or letters or footage or something. If only.The film has a misunderstanding of even the most basic things and passes off that misunderstanding as knowledge. Marianne tells Max (Brad Pitt) that after having sex, men would go to the roof to sleep. That was the custom, she said. But that's not a custom. People sleep on the roof (where it's cooler at night) because Morocco is a hot country and this was before the advent of air conditioning. If couples want to have sex, the roof does not give any privacy and public sex is indecent in the human kingdom. Even car sex gets you in trouble with the law in most countries. Imagine if she said ""this is a conservative country. We can't have sex on the roof"" - as opposed to...? Quebec? Paris? The UK? You can't have sex on the roof here either. Not even in 2017. Cops are such party poopers.This ""no sex on the roof"" thing is twisted and presented as some exotic custom. Moroccans and Germans are such prudes. The UK has lesbians openly living together in the 40's in front of military officers, while Moroccans and Germans make a big fuss over a little dogging on the roof.There's no point in going over every tiny thing, but this film was just one thing after another. Misunderstandings, anachronisms, stereotypes and clichés. From Moroccans to Brits, from Quebecers to Parisians, the film is filled with faults and errors.I would turn a blind eye to all of them if the movie was good, but it wasn't. An accurate film that's not very entertaining would get a good score. An inaccurate thing that's entertaining gets a good score. Inaccurate and boring? Sorry. Sucks."
" disappointing
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,2,I really wanted to like this movie but it was horrible. An American actor acting like he's from Quebec and then pretending to be French. I couldn't understand one word Marion Cotillard said in English. There was no Chemistry btw her and Brad Pitt. Their acting was bad. The story is unrealistic. The only impressive thing was the costumes and scenery.
" A well-constructed drama, which nicely combine love, passion and patriotism.
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,9,"I am personally a Brad Pitt fan, so I might be biased throughout my review. However, the story is well-constructed, realistically and really gives you a feeling about that period. The core of the movie is not very original, but in my opinion is better realized. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to taste the life of the secret agents in WWII. I am convinced you will enjoy the movie and be surprised by the end."
" Pitts poor french
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,6,"I just laughed at Marions line ""your French is good, but you're Parisian accent isn't..."" Brads French is so bad, no real French speaking person would ever mistake him for a native speaker. It's basically on par with his Italian in Inglorious Bastards. There is no room for subtlety in their encounter, no finesse in their romance, just because of that. I have nothing against Brad, but not the actor for this role. But, they chose a bankable actor over a believable one, and still the movie lost money."
" Borrrrrrrring!
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,2,"Hollywood is divided into two parts now, the way larger part is for war and sci-fi movies, and for most parts with no actual imagination, repeating the same old stories with new actors. But why? All that money budgeting stupid pointless non-amusing forgettable movies for what? and half of these movies usually lose money. So basically these people gamble in the most wrong way. With art movies, the loss of money brings something brilliant and memorable, at least, but with these expensive trashes nothing, absolutely nothing is gained.And the part where these actors are so rich they don't need the money at all then why accepting to act in these movies and add something so horrible to their resume, is what makes me wonder the most."
" We are married...why would we laugh?

When they reunite in London, their relationship is tested by the pressures of war. ""A husband would offer his wife a cigarette before lighting his own."" Maybe she doesn't know how to work a safety, but she can sure shoot a gun!! Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard were exquisite is this period piece about spies in WW2. The cinematography was amazing in spots and the action scenes were great, just not enough of them to consider this any type of action movie. I thought it might play out like the 1942 version of ""Mr. and Mrs. Smith"" but it took a turn I did not expect. Before your baby takes her first steps, try this one on and see how it fits!!"
" Brad Pitt sleepwalks through an entire film
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,5,"This film has a powerful story, many stunning scenes, and Marion Cotillard. But it also has Brad Pitt. Big mistake. Not only does Pitt seem to have had his face worked on, so that it can show little emotion anymore, but he is also apparently not Brad Pitt anymore. Is this a zombie who has taken his place? He plays opposite Marion Cotillard in countless intimate scenes, she tries every device she can think of to wake him up, but still he slumbers. A cardboard cutout of the Brad Pitt we used to know would have been more effective. Considering that this is a film wholly dependent upon the relationship between Pitt and Cotillard, the result is a disaster. The chemistry between them is so far below absolute zero that we are in a deeply frozen universe. Meanwhile, an enormous crew and the director Robert Zemeckis (famous for FORREST GUMP and BACK TO THE FUTURE) struggle to hold back the Red Sea so that the entire cast do not drown in a sea of indifference. We have the excellent Jared Harris, beloved of all MAD MEN fans, adding his resonant voice which is as soothing as hot chocolate, but lacking closeups, so that we can barely see him. We have Gary Sinese, an old chum of Zemeckis. We even have Simon McBurney. But still there is no thaw. We have great scenes. There is sex inside an old car in the middle of a sandstorm in the desert (lacking however any continuity link to the succeeding scenes, which is both an editing and a directing lapse). There is a birth of a baby in the open in the middle of an air raid. There is a man landing on a sand dune by parachute, seen from the air as he descends (astonishing camera work) which is ostensibly in Morocco but was really filmed in the Canary Islands, where all the North African locations were simulated. (There are in any case no such sand dunes near Casablanca, just for the record.) And there is a plane coming straight at a house but which misses its roof by a whisker and crashes across the street. That street is Willow Road in London's Hampstead, where so much action takes place. I could not make out whether the house was meant to be that of my friend Rupert Sheldrake, but I must go have a look at his roof to see whether it is damaged. Later when we see baby Anna taking her first steps, with the wrecked German plane in the background, it is on a hill far from Willow Road, but then this is only a movie. This is a film which should have been fantastic. But it has no pace, it is in fact languid and lingering. It is meant to be a powerful thriller and intense personal drama, but where is the editing to keep it going, where are the intense angles, and above all, where is the hero? Sound asleep, of course. Yes, there are plenty of spectacular setups. Many people worked their butts off giving us great sets, great props, great clothes, wonderful period cars. There are searchlights and anti-aircraft guns slaving away for our benefit, there are Sten guns, Nazis, stern 'V Section' spooks, uniforms, pistols, the whole shebang. But where are the pace, the intensity, and the excitement? All the elements are there, but we wait in vain for it all to move us. This is a passionless film. I also think Steven Knight's screenplay was greatly lacking in any true cinematic sense, and that he is just not a natural writer for the screen, despite having numerous credits. What a waste of a wonderful opportunity this is. And all that money spent on it! Zemeckis rolls scene after scene onstage as if he were producing a variety show in a theatre, or reading from Steven Knight's shopping list, and expects them all to adhere. But they are episodic rather than unified. We go from one outstanding setup to another. But we do not do so quickly enough, there is not enough glue, and above all, the nearest thing to a meaningful Pitt which we see in this film, vaguely and in the distance, are the ones on Jared Harris's face, remembered from MAD MEN, where we all learned to find them endearing marks of his individuality. Marion Cotillard deserves an Oscar for trying. But she might as well be kissing a film poster, and even a rag doll would be more responsive to her embraces. All of her plentiful allure is just so much water thrown at the desert sands, disappearing instantly and leaving no trace. If one pretends all the flaws are not there, one can still just about enjoy this film because of its dramatic and tragic story. But its lack of vigour just makes it look so contrived."
" Imezing movie
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,10,"I'm difficult person to like any movies, but this movie was exactly perfect and unbelievable that i have ever seen. It must be world top 10 best film ever. Bradd pitt makes most of time good movies but this movies something perfect. The best movie ever seen about love and war. You don't get any boring time if you watch the movie."
" Casablanca redux?
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,7,"I have always felt that any movie with a love story set in Casablanca has an uphill battle to avoid being compared to Bogart and Bergman's all time classic. I have to admit that was my first take, but kudos to Pitt and Cotillard for drawing me in with compelling performances and when the plot turned to the the spy vs spy intrigue in London I was totally into this flick. To say more is to give away a poignant plot twist that makes ALLIED a must see."
" Terrific
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,8,"Please don't let those that KNOW History stop you from watching this movie. There most definitely is a plot and many twists. It was a Hell of a lot better than Mr & Mrs Smith. I watched it twice to make sure I understood everything and it will stay with you for a long time. There is a fine line between realism, art and reality, this movie has it all. The story is engrossing from the beginning to the end and it will stop you in your tracks. Again, don't go for historical facts, go for the entertainment and an insight into the fear that captured everyone at that time. It was real, it was scary and it really happened. Brad has all that it takes to be the great Actor that he is."
" A solid drama, not an action film.
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,8,"The key to understanding and appreciating Allied is knowing what kind of film it is. The trailers made the film look like it was a genre film -- some hybrid of a wartime action and espionage film. But it isn't either of these. It is simply a drama about two people in the context of WWII, how they come to trust one another, and what happens when that trust is put in question. In the same way that Flight (another good Zemeckis film) was made by its trailer to look like a courtroom drama instead of a dramatic character study, the trailer for Allied misled the public as to what the film was about, and that's never a recipe for customer satisfaction. If you take the film on its own merits, at face value, I don't think you'll be disappointed. The performances are good, the period sets and costumes are outstanding, the cinematography is more than attractive, and the script is suspenseful and moving. It may not be the world's greatest film, but I did not feel cheated by it in any way, and you'll probably be fine as long as you're not expecting something like one of the Mission:Impossible films. Like some of the films directed by Pitt's friend, George Clooney (e.g. The Good German and Goodnight & Good Luck), Allied hearkens back to character-driven Hollywood dramas of the 1940s and 50s. If you don't like Allied, you probably haven't seen enough older films and/or have spent too much time playing video games (and expect your films to be like them)."
" Best love-making scene in recent movie memory!
",2017-03-31 00:00:00,9,"My husband and I watched ""Allied"" not being sure what to expect. We had recently watched WWII film ""Anthropoid"" but ""Allied""'s premise seemed more of a love story than a war story.It turned out to be both. It had a dash of ""The Dirty Dozen"" (picture a carefully executed plot to assassinate Nazi officials in their lair), ""Casablanca"" (""Allied"" is even set partially in this Moroccan city as was the classic Bogart/Bergman film), and ""Sophie's Choice"" (a difficult ultimatum given to a main character). Despite the obligatory homosexual plot device (Max's sister is a lesbian - totally inorganic to the film, but Hollywood must have a contract clause written in every film released that it is required to have a sympathetic homosexual character), this film feels true to the contemporaneous WWII films which it attempts to emulate.I would not give it a ""10"" because it does feel forced in certain spots, but I would recommend it for what my husband calls the ""best love-making scene in recent movie memory"" (in a car in a desert sand storm, no less) - VERY sexy!"
" Disappointed
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,5,"I was curious as to how this movie would play out. I enjoyed the film, but I was disappointed with the ending. With a different ending, I could have overlooked a lot of the other flaws. (Obviously this will include spoilers).The story is somewhat basic--two operatives on a mission fall in love and get married. Then, one of them is revealed to be a spy for the Germans, though a reluctant one at that. Half of the film is devoted to developing Pitt and Cotillard's relationship. It starts with a thrilling mission in Casablanca and ends with their eventual marriage, birth of their daughter, and Pitt's humdrum life as a desk officer in British intelligence. The second half of the movie revolves around Pitt being briefed that his wife is a German spy and that he must cooperate in a ""blue dye"" operation to know for sure. Over the course of three days, he must act normal and go along with the operation. Pitt is told that if she is found to be a spy, he must execute her immediately, or they will both be executed. But he loves his wife and he wants to prove her innocent, so he goes to great lengths to get information ... only to find out that she is indeed not the person she claimed she was. But she loves him and she was only cooperating with the Germans out of coercion. Pitt decides to spirit his family out of the country (in a single engine plane that couldn't have taken them anywhere useful, except maybe Ireland) but they are stopped and Cotillard, knowing her husband won't pull the trigger, shoots herself after confessing her love and telling Pitt that he must take care of their daughter. The end of the film is the verbal reading of a letter Cotillard wrote on her last day with her family (she knew she'd be caught). This ending really left a hollow feeling in me. It would have been better if Cotillard had somehow been saved. Indeed, there is historical precedent that the movie ignored.The whole ""you must execute her on the spot!"" thing was contrived. The British routinely turned German agents into double agents. Only the most hardened of spies who refused to turn would have been executed, and even then, most were imprisoned. Cotillard would have eagerly agreed to work as a double. It would have been a nice ending if she passed fraudulent reports to the Germans in the lead-up to D- Day, thus ""saving the day.""In reality, by the time D-Day kicked off, all of Germany's spies in the UK had been rolled up (either executed, imprisoned, or turned), so the whole notion that Cotillard's character would have been working for a German network is pure fiction.It's also fiction that Pitt (who is in his 50s) would be a ""field man."" At his age and with his rank, he would have been a senior officer working out of England, not parachuting into Morocco. And if Cotillard was suspected as a spy, Pitt would have also been investigated. He would not have been told to go along with this scheme. Why? Because of what we saw in the film. He would have been emotionally compromised. Therefore, the first Pitt would have heard of this would have been when she was arrested and he along with her. They would have interrogated him and ensured that he wasn't a witting accomplice.It was later stated in the film that the ambassador they assassinated in the beginning of a film was actually a dissident whom Hitler wanted killed. If so, Hitler would have just recalled the man and executed him in Berlin. He would not have allowed some long-odds intelligence operation to go forth in which he'd lose a number of SS and Abwehr officers. In short, there would be easier ways to get an agent into the British network.Anyway, I wanted to like this film better. If they had given it a happier ending, I would have. I thought the whole ""Allied"" title might be a nod towards how a husband and wife are allied together."
" the complex themes on display are much more rewarding that most would have you believe
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,10,"Allied has more to do with newer, visceral movie attitudes than one would except by the trailer alone. The setting is vintage Hollywood style films of the 1940's but there is more violence and action than any other Robert Zemeckis movie I can remember. This new phase of Zemeckis career, along with his previous Flight and The Walk, combines the animated qualities of his gorgeous looking Polar Express and Beowulf with a newer feeling of betrayal and misdirection. Another place the movie succeeds is emotion, the audience feels the connection that Pitt's character feels for his wife whether or not she turns out to be a German spy, and the beautiful thing about it is it would work either way.Destined to be written off as old fashioned or generic, looking beyond the simple surface of a film like Allied is to really see the greatness in all movies, as the complex themes on display are much more rewarding that most would have you believe. It's also one of Brad Pitt's best performances in a decade where has given plenty, perhaps more than any other major movie star of his time (Inglorious Bastards, Tree of Live, The Big Short, The Counselor)."
" Squeeze the Nazi plot yet another bit
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,6,"Zemeckis knows how to tell stories, and how to keep focus and all that. Yes, the cinematography is perfect, the rhythm is perfect and even there is chemistry between Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard. But Pitt seems to be specializing himself in Nazi-killer roles, where he can shoot around just anyone with no moral implications, making the plot to lose most of its human dimension. I have no problem with going once and again to those old good days where Britons win, so they can keep their heads up against evil Germans at least in the dark of a movie theater, but I am personally growing sick of those trigger-happy macho-type die-hard and would welcome some deeper plot where human lives count. All."
" we can't really find a strong chemistry
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,7,"Allied is a WWII tale in which we've seen it before but with a different take, it is an ideal drama-thriller-romance story but we can just take the romance away since we can't really find a strong chemistry.The film's nature is very close to what a World War II environment feel should be, but, its more amazing to know that not every design, especially on their clothing, are pulled out exactly as what we knew from history books. As quoted from the film's costume designer, Joanna Johnston during an interview with Fashionista: ""I wanted to ground it in the time, but I also wanted to give it its own look, so you kind of pick and mix, in that regard. I think it's a very attractive period, and it looks good to our contemporary eyes at this point in time, so it's not difficult to make it look good for the film. Nothing was a straight copy, it was a whole load of different influences or parts that go into making your interpretation for the film."".Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard both looked lavishly good, with their dresses and suits they both resemble power and class. Cotillard, notably, seemed to fit on every dresses, and no matter what you make her wear, she remains stunningly gorgeous.Pitt and Cotillard had their share of talent throughout the film, even though the romantic charisma between the two didn't spark that bright, they were still able to carry and effectively played their role in a very compelling manner.As the biggest revelation unravels, the couple tried their best to save their relationship by running away, but only then that they realized that their love is not just built on survival, but also by sacrifice."
" New favorite movie
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,10,"Despite the negative reviews I was very excited to watch the film. The movie disappointed me in a positive way even though I generally like WWII movies. First of all, it is not a typical war movie, with the bombings and special effects, the main story line is built around a romance. It does have a lot of action though, and in my opinion the outcomes of the action parts are not at all what you expect them to be. I was dealing with a big decision when I watched the movie and it completely took my mind off it. Many parts of the movie are in French, so for me that was also a plus point. I also enjoyed the romance, I think it was written beautifully and Marion Cotillard and Brad Pitt played amazingly.Honestly, this is my new favorite movie. So if you're for the romance with a bit of action (but not in those action movie way) and sophisticated style, then this movie is for you. However if you expect a typical war movie, look for something else."
" Don't go by the reviews, go for the film!!!
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,10,"Before I proceed to writing anything about the film, I must here commend an absolutely brilliant performance by Brad Pitt. What an excellent actor and what a solid performance he's put in here! He so well depicted the inner suffering that he went through after being made to suspect the wife he loved so much, and the doubts that went through his mind at the party and in general. The performance by the other protagonist and everyone else is pretty good, too.This film's getting a very raw deal I'm afraid. Given the uniqueness of the theme of the film, I was pretty sure to watch this at the cinema but negative reviews held me back. I thought, again, the whole concept was very unique and it must've required very sharp application, which the film-makers did very well. The suspense and the thrills that it creates with the twists and turns the film takes - like the possibility of this whole thing being a test for Max before he's given the promotion - and the connection that it puts between one event to another is all a work of some very intelligent people behind the camera.Such films could easily turn boring half way through, but for the qualities mentioned above and the World War Two as background meant that it always keeps you on your toes. I particular loved the scene where at the party they show the visuals from the ground as to how it feels when you witness jets fighting out things over your head, and then boom, the shot plane is heading towards your residence! Another thrilling scene was, when he followers the jeweler and tries to catch him off-guard by referring to the earrings, but he responds by giving the same answer as Max's wife.A couple flaws that I noticed: 1. the whole scene created and him in the first place flying to France to meet Delamare looked a bit odd. 2. Understand that the German Ambassador might've been a dissident that Hitler would've happily got killed in the process, but why would he sacrifice so many other officers just to be able to plant a spy? If my memory serves my well, Max and Marianne killed a lot of German personnel that day.It must be having other flaws too, but it didn't matter to me yesterday; or you could say the brilliant performances made me overlook all those things, and the twists themselves take your mind off anything else. So I'll take all that any day as a part of the package. So forget the nit-picking, the film is brilliant!I must add here that this film is a thousand times more exciting than any of the espionage films that I've watched so far from the James Bond, 'Mission Impossible' or Jason Bourne series. A lot of them have been a yawn-fest for me."
" I liked it in spite of what everyone else says
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,8,"Director Robert Zemeckis gives us some breathtaking moments in ""Allied"" from 2015. The film stars Brad Pitt and Marian Cotillard as Max and Marianne, two spies who meet on a joint assignment in France and fall in love. Mission accomplished, Max proposes. She is allowed to come to England and marry him, and they have a beautiful daughter.One day Max's bosses call him in and say that they believe Marianne took the name of an executed resistance worker and is, in fact, a German spy. They order him to write down a fake message he will be given by phone, and if it shows up in transmissions the following Monday, they will know the truth. Then he must execute her. Max, however, has no intention of waiting until Monday to find out.By no means is this a perfect film and yes, some parts are easy to guess. When you've seen 5000 films or more, it's not hard to know what's going to happen after certain scenes. The script could have been a little more interesting. I certainly didn't find it sentimental and goopy as someone described it. And what the heck is wrong with sentiment anyway? It was not, to me, overdone.If I am being honest, I think the problem lay with the casting of Brad Pitt. He's a real honest-to-God movie star as they had in the old Hollywood, and I love him. But this is a role that should have been played by someone like Jason Isaacs or Tom Hardy or Tom Hiddleston. Pitt does not bring to the character the layers and depth which would have made this a richer film. He has the stoicism but little else. Also I found his face distracting - he's had injections in the bottom part of his face and it looks different.Cotillard, on the other hand, gives a brilliant performance of an expert spy who falls in love with her temporary partner, sending her life into another trajectory.Someone pointed out some modernizations that were off-putting. One was Max's sister as an out lesbian - highly doubtful in those days in England. The one I caught was the phrase ""take it outside."" It was like the Amelia Earhart movie with Diane Keaton where she says ""cut the crap."" Are these screenwriters kidding? A little more care needs to be taken when dealing with period pieces.The special effects were fantastic and brought home the idea of how close in proximity the war was to the British people. The scene with the ambassador was excellent; but my favorite scene was the one in the desert with the car. Beautiful.I recommend it. I thought it was well done and well acted, exciting in parts, and also poignant. To young people I say - don't be hardened to sentimentality at your age."
" A classic example of the wayward opportunity
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,6,"As Brad Pitt's character parachutes down towards the Moroccan sand dunes in a sweepingly beautiful track shot as the movie opens, Zemeckis teases you yet again. He gives you a promisingly beautiful, cinematic and engaging setup that he never carries through. It is a shame. That opening promised a great film considering the talent involved. The inspiration and the homages the film intends to pay are justified and handled with care and taste, yet the story itself doesn't seem to take a clear stand on whether this is a romantic drama set in the backdrop of WW2 or a gripping WW2 drama with a romantic story at its centre. This might seem like a play on words, but its rather not; whatever the approach Knight and Zemeckis should have spent more time delving into the plot, giving each character more room to grow and the audience more time or better setup to care for them. Pitt and Cotillard don't seem to know which part to play either, as their delivery never really gives us any empathy for the characters to make the finale poignant.Allied is sadly just that, an amalgam of great condiments that somehow don't go together leading to a bittersweet final product that leaves you scratching your head wondering what could have been."
" Why do producers of movies totally ignore accuracy
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,6,"Maybe a small spoiler here. As this movie is set during WW2 one would think that time-lines would be considered. This movie like so many others is full of implausible holes. This greatly reduces my personal enjoyment of the film because it irritates most of us that notice them. Just one example, by the time they had a big party where a Nazi Bomber just missed their house it would have been early 1944 or late 1943 the earliest, correct me if I'm wrong but i'm pretty sure that the Germans were starting to lose the war and were no longer bombing England with large formations of bombers, V Rockets perhaps yes. There are many other implausible things I could list but will keep this short. I don't care about tiny details that 99 percent of people wouldn't notice like this or that model machine gun wasn't used at that time, but the bombing of England 3 years after the Blitz ended? Really? I'm sure a lot of older people would have noticed especially the Brits. Film makers should hire experts on the time-line of a movie to go through the script to find and weed out any glaring inaccuracies. Then I and others can concentrate on the story and believe it, fall into the fantasy so to speak."
" Between war spy drama and action
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"I was really surprised by this movie, when i watched the trailer i thought it could be enjoyable bit I have to say that it's definitely better than I expected. Robert Zemeckis was able to put together an interesting story between historical war drama and action. The movie it's well directed and the cast works very well. I was a fan of Zemeckis some years ago and i tough he has lost the touch in it's later production but in this one i have really nothing to regret for. The historical environment it's well reproduce and everything it's very believable. The movie moves between an historical war story in the beginning to a drama in the middle to a spy action movie close to the end..and always keeping the viewer stuck in the chair. Well done photography and visual effects ( just the Brad Pitt landing seems in some ways fake) add to the movie some more credibility but what works more it 's a script that create a very enjoyable entertainment"
" A nice romantic fable, but a preposterous spy thriller
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,5,"Allied is a nice romantic fable, sweet and quite touching at times, about what two people caught in very extenuating circumstances might do in the name of love. However, the writer for this movie was so caught up in the artificial setup of the ""intimate betrayal rule"", the spy thriller part of the movie became preposterous at times, so much so that it detracted from the believability of the entire movie, and ultimately, it became hard to comprehend why the characters behaved as they did.The movie has been out for a while, so I hope it is okay to include some SPOILERS to make my point about how preposterous the setup for this movie is. If you don't want to know how the movie ends, then please stop reading right now.So, at the beginning, Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard) pretends to be a French resistance fighter, but really a German spy planted there with the ultimate intent of winning the trust of the Allies and to infiltrate their spy organization. To do that she is going to help Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) kill off an expendable German dissident (Anton Blake). But the way they killed him off, I find it hard to believe that the German Abwehr, even in their most heartless and depraved state, would have allowed the killing of a score of innocent Germans in the process. All that the Abwehr had to do was let Herr Hobar (August Diehl) in on the plot and arrange a private meeting between the German Ambassador and Marianne and Max, just kill him nice and quietly, but I guess that would not have made for that exciting shootout scene at the party.With that mission accomplished and having not only earned the trust, but the love of Max Vatan, Marianne is now off to London to be his wife. Unbeknownst to her, the British SOE captures an Abwehr agent who spills the whole beans about her true identity, while at the same time, a lot of secret information that passes by her husband's desk ends up in some radio transmissions from her area of London. Wow, and then the SOE ""rat catcher"" (Simon McBurney) tells all this to Max and tells him how they are going to determine whether she is a spy or not. I am sorry, but the SOE in its most stupid and inebriated state would not tell this to the husband of a suspected spy, who himself would automatically be suspect. They would have just passed bogus information to him without him knowing to see if that information also turns up in the radio transmissions and try to catch them both. Tap their phones, bug their house, put them under 24-hour surveillance. Anything but the way they proceeded.At the end, Max finds out his wife is really not the real Marianne Beausejour because she can't play the piano. She makes a totally bogus excuse that other German spies threatened their daughter, Anna (Pearl and Luna Rumbelow). Preposterous! The only explanation possible is that she was a willing German spy up to that point, and that her love for the Nazis was greater than her love for Max or Anna, because if she really loved them both, all she had to do was to turn her handlers in to MI5 and could have even still kept her false identity of Marianne Beausejour. It turns out that Max was her stooge for 2 years. Ouch!The most preposterous moment of the movie came for me when Max's commanding officer, Frank (Jared Harris), tells Max that he ""blatantly disobeyed orders"", which resulted in another soldier being killed. In a time of war. At that moment, I thought, oh god, this movie is going to end with Max being court- martialed and being executed by firing squad. But instead, he retires to a horse farm in Canada. Totally preposterous! But then again, if it didn't end the way it did, this movie would not have been a nice romantic fable. Watch this for the romance. Overlook all the preposterous spy thriller setup."
" 'We met at Casablanca, where together we assassinated the German ambassador. She's a mother of my child.'
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,9,"Veteran British author wrote both the story and the screenplay for this World War II espionage romance for Robert Zemeckis to direct. It is a solid film that relates that port of WW II about which we know very little – the spy techniques and manner in which the world struggled to oppose and ultimately defeat Hitler's Nazi Germany. If boundaries of commitment are vague, that is how war divides (and brings together) people from different countries and backgrounds.The date is 1942 in French Morocco during the World War II, the Canadian spy Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) parachutes into French Morocco to meet the French Resistance Fighter Marianne Beauséjour (Marion Cotillard) who is assigned to pose as his wife in Casablanca. Their mission is to assassinate the German Ambassador (Anton Blake) during a reception. They live together soon fall in love, breaking a rule in the system of spying. When Max returns to his base in London, he brings Marianne and marries her. One year later, they have the baby daughter Anna during a bombing. One day, Max is summoned for a meeting in the feared V Section with his commander officer Frank Heslop (Jared Harris) and a secret service agent (Simon McBurney) who tells Max they suspect Marianne is a German Spy. Further, they will give a fake order to him to confirm whether Marianne is a spy or not. If she is, Max shall execute his beloved wife; otherwise they will be both executed. The ending is terrifying.Zemeckis manages to mix just the right proportions of violence with erotica and with the able assistance of is excellent cast offers us an inside view of that part of WW II about which we know very little. An engaging espionage tinged romance with food for thought."
" It does not become Zemeckis but it entertains
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,5,"1485/5000 I began to see her having heard that she was very bad. I imagined the worst. Luckily, it was not so bad. Let it look even if you forget it soon.He has moments when you recognize Robert, but in itself, does not reach his level. It goes very far in every respect. If something characterizes this director, it is how he knows how to put the camera to tell you the story with beautiful blueprints, without having to make a succession of close-ups and detailed plans. This time he does it at some point but it is not the characteristic thing.The love story does not become, they are not seen in love at any time. I'd rather say it's a spy movie. The film has several parts, so to speak.None of the actors are great, rather they are to cover file. But the whole movie is like this. At no time is it seen in the film that it is made with great seriousness, rather, it had to be done and done.The photograph is beautiful, without being an excellent photograph.Her direction at times, as at first seeing the cartridge and the car or the moment we see paper on the table and she walking that are beautiful and spectacular. It does not get boring but in no time gets to get you do not blink.The love scene is totally overpowering and I'm too prepared.The effects, while well-made, are not spectacular.I'll wait impatiently for Zemeckis's next movie, to see if it takes away this bittersweet taste."

It might teach them something."
" Ignore the inaccuracies
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,8,"The is a fictional drama. That's really important to remember, and with that in mind, this is a great film. OK, there are a few inaccuracies, for the sake of entertainment, but all this film wants to be is an entertaining film about espionage set during WW2. The setting is almost irrelevant but gives it some context, so watch it with an open mind, and make sure your head isn't up your arse so you can enjoy it for what it is."
" It could've been great
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,5,"(Warning, contains spoilers)The first part of this movie is excellent. Packed with well thought action, the plot evolves very naturally, and made me really interested on what was going to happen next. It is really good. By the second part, when they get back to London, and Max receives the news that his wife could be a Spy, I was like ""wow, interesting"". I didn't see that coming, and thought it was very original and could lead to a very good story. After the movie ended, though, I was pretty disappointed. It left me with a feeling of ""It could have been much better"". I believe that action could have been built much more, all the way up till the end of the movie. Since the plot was very interesting, action could build up till a ""grand finale"". But the second part was mostly very bland and redundant. During it, there was a lot of cliché moves from the director to stall the story as much as he could. Like every time Max got closer to a lead about his wife, some kind of ""coincidence"" or ""random"" action or thing happened to delay his investigation. For example, like when he went to ask the man in the wheelchair if he knew his wife in the picture. But ""coincidentally"" it happened that the man was blind. Or when he sent that rookie soldier to ask if the battlefield's officer knew his wife. The man was too drunk, couldn't answer the boy, and the rookie soldier died. Then he went to the local prison ask the man personally, and he started vomiting, saying nonsense things, delaying, delaying and delaying his investigation. These cliché moves from the director made watching the second part even a little irritating. It looks like he was out of ideas to make the movie's progression interesting and dynamic, as it was on the first part, so he had to resort to that to stall the story, so that the movie didn't end too fast. But it wouldn't have ended too fast, it just would have made the progression more dynamic and realistic, and then the story could had evolved in different ways. Like Max could have discovered sooner that his wife was indeed a German spy, but after knowing that she still loved him, they could had successfully flown to Switzerland, but the British government went after them, and they had to manage trying to escape them AND the German government as well, who also went after Marianne. You know? Something to keep the plot interesting, progressing and dynamic. I think the plot was very good had a lot of potential. By the end of the movie it indeed left me with a little bitter taste. It could have been better."
" Good Love Story
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,9,"In 1942, Canadian Officer Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) and Marianne (Marion Cotillard) join forces to assassinate a German Ambassador. They work well together (Ala Mr and Mrs Smith) and Max asks Marianne to join him in England as his wife. She agrees and they marry and they have a baby, Anna. Later Max is told that Marianne may be a German spy. Max is very upset hearing this news and he has to prove this is not the case. There is a plan by the Royal Air Force to determine if Marianne is indeed a German spy. Max is ordered to comply with this plan and to stand down otherwise. Of course, he doesn't and goes about trying to prove Marianne is not a German spy. We in the audience have no way of knowing if Marianne is a German spy and we hope Max can prove she is not. The love between Max and Marianne is very good, and the chemistry is spot on, that is, until Max is told Marianne may be a German spy. He cannot help it but does look at Marianne somewhat differently and she does notice that something isn't right. The acting is good all around and we listen and look for subtle clues and we come up empty. The movie is somewhat slow going, but we are trying to help Max and we trudge along with him. Slowness isn't a concern of ours. They had some special effects that had me diving under the couch. A German plane being shot down looked like it would end up in Max's house, but didn't. Very Scary. Just prior to that the British shooting down German planes showed a sky being all shot up everywhere. Good effects.Okay, you will not like the ending as I didn't either. In a word it is ""shocking.""

" Mixed Bag
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,6,"You'll either be picking it apart for being stupid, or you'll enjoy the pacing and beautiful look of the film.""Allied"" starts quickly with a pitch-perfect set-up and a truly solid first half-hour. You're drawn into the film and Cotillard and Pitt, like the cinematography, are just gorgeous. The film is entertaining, without question.That said, the film has a few too many period/cultural inaccuracies and also a rather sloppy last half-hour that brings it down a bit.I just cant destroy the film for what amounts to 3-4 oversights. While they are big problems in terms of 'how can you not get it right' , they are still outweighed by the films overall production values, performances, and well-paced storyline. Allied is a good movie for those who want entertainment and wont be too distracted by the historical mistakes. If these types of issues ruin a movie for you then don't watch it. For me this is a strong 6, and had immense potential to be so much more. Can we go back to the love scene in the car and shoot the rest of the movie again, because for a moment there I thought Zemeckis had another masterpiece. I wasn't disappointed overall, but the much lower budget ""Anthropoid"" was better."
" Here's looking at you
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,5,"Allied by Robert Zemeckis is the pretender to the crown of Casablanca, part of it is even set there. Brad Pitt is a Canadian intelligence officer and Marion Cotillard is a French Resistance fighter acting as a collaborator who fall in love during a mission in Casablanca.We see them meet in the first half of the film as they undertake a dangerous mission to assassinate a German diplomat, who fall in love and then get married and settle in London. The film takes a turn when Cotillard comes under suspicion and it is her husband Pitt who has to reluctantly expose her.The plot is implausible, the pacing is poor and Zemeckis has made an empty film which does not live up to its initial promise."
" Average Movie
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,6,"Pros:All actors are talented.Good story plot.smart conversations.good camera work. great war effects.Cons:somehow director failed to put you in the atmosphere of the 2nd war era, you still can feel like modern times.movie is a stereotype of showing a western agent kill many German soldiers like James Bond style is absurd & silly. in reality Nazi soldiers were very skilled and hard to beat whether by hand combat or by exchange shooting. so when are Hollywood going to stop underestimating human mind? Worst part of this movie is director attempting to shove the gay-lesbianism in the movie by showing two women openly living together in a lesbian setup, which was not possible in the 40s as society was not (yet) tamed to accept these affairs socially. A classic Hollywood notorious move to naturalize gay-lesbian affairs in history by re-writing history so that our new generations would accept this non-natural affair into their lives. So for straight people please be aware of this point."

I love movies about spies and history so this was right up my alley. The first half hour is very slow so be ready for that. The movie then starts to pick up but never quite got to the point where I wanted it to be. This movie reminded me of the Tourist. It was much better than that one but had the same feel of a movie trying too hard to be important and it came off feeling forced with no real heart. It could have been my high expectations but I was just really disappointed in this. Overall, not terrible but a disappointing that didn't seem to have any real heart at all. I sadly give this a B-."

" Marriage made in the field never work!
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,9,"This is definitely among the top five films of the year. But the sad part is the Oscars snub. Nominated for Costume Design, but I expected the Best Actor, Actress, and particularly Original Screenplay and Motion Picture. This amazing spy thriller-drama was directed by Robert Zemeckis of many popular flicks. The best casting in the recent films and visually so good of those 40s atmosphere, like it be the war or the society.This is the story of two spies from different nation who meet in Casablanca for a mission. Pretending to be a newly wed couple, soon they enter the real wedlock. The rest of the tale follows a couple of years later when a big question arises, in that they have to prove their innocence. Failing it could lead them to a serious consequence. So the narration filled with suspense and thriller takes over with a greater pace till the end.Obviously the film was long, but I did not mind or I could say I did not know how the two hours went on so quickly. Engaging plot kept me my focus on the screen. As we know, all these years the Oscars turned down the best performance recognitions, including this one for Brad.Before going to watch this film, I thought it was another World War II film which might be inspired by the real. But it was not. Takes place in the background of the same war, but this is a spy film. And their personal life and profession, how one another influences is what revealed. Now I don't know when such kind of a great spy thriller I'm going to watch next. I think it is massively underrated, especially stupid film critics and their takes on it was unbelievably wrong. I surely, highly recommend it.9/10"
" A pretty yet emotionless World War 2 thriller
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,5,"Despite it's fine production values, A-list leads that do the best with what their given and a thrilling World War 2 set-up (on face value), Allied is an unfortunately dull, mature blockbuster that continues the recent Robert Zemeckis form slump that is showing no signs of ending anytime soon.A rightfully respected director who found fame by entertaining (Back to the Future), encapsulating hearts (Forest Gump) and drawing out terrific acting turns (Cast Away), the 2000's have seen Zemeckis lose his way with misguided CGI events like The Polar Express and lifeless spectacles such as The Walk, and while 2012's Flight had it's moments, many including myself had hoped Allied with it's potent setting and powerful leads was the film to once more bring out the best from the talented director.All lead up elements towards Allied's impending release seemed to suggest the World War 2 thriller, that pays homage to Hollywood productions of old (Casablanca often springs to mind) was set to be both an Oscar darling and an audience appealing event but working only mildly at the best of times as a spy thriller molded with a love story, Allied threatens more than once to become the film it could've been, whilst sadly ending up as the film it is.Failing to connect us emotionally to the story of Brad Pitt's Canadian spy Max Vatan and Marion Cotillard's European spy Marianne Beauséjour as they team up to take down evil Nazi's whilst low and behold falling head over heals in love, Zemeckis may find moments within his film that thrill but their mostly brief glimpses of set pieces that could've and really should've provided a lot more bang for buck.Scenes in Allied such as a bombing raid birth, a daring village mission or a sandstorm lovers sojourn all seem designed purely to enliven previously boorish lead-in scenes made worse by screenwriter Steven Knights' often cringe-worthy dialogue or heavily CGI'd production values, and even though Allied's leads share moments together where they light up the screen, this much documented pairing of Pitt and Cotillard won't exactly be setting the world on fire, with some of their moments as star crossed lovers feeling rather forced when it needed to be so much more.It's hard to know absolutely whether other actors placed in these roles could've elevated Allied's chances of success, but if this pairing can't make it work, clearly Allied has suffered from other damaging factors.There's a terrific film somewhere within Allied; a film we only sometimes catch. It should've been a thriller that moves us with its romance and races our hearts as the stakes are raised, but this pretty, yet emotionally cold production is forgettable and marks another so-so film from a director who knows how to do better but can't seem to find a heart and soul within his current crop of productions to do so.2 and a half pieces of bread out of 5"
" Below average
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,3,Being a fan of war movies i decided to watch this one. But it was a total disappointment. Only good thing about picture is its cast and i have no idea why Brad Pitt and Marion had signed it in the first place. Storyline is very much loose and predictable. There was some action in the movie but nothing big. Director could have done much better. And is there anybody else who noticed over face makeup on Brad Pitt or it was just me.
" Misfire on story level, but not wholly unwatchable
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,6,"So close to being something remarkable that the screen it plays on can sometimes fold out and reveal lush detail of romance and intrigue of old that we folk just don't see anymore. The pacing is just galloping on ahead when the actors need allowance to breathe and spread their talents into the cogs and springs of their characters. Alas, the central romance is a tad rushed, less Bergman/Bogart and more modern hack rom-com, which leads to suffering on-screen and off.I do appreciate the return of Bob Zemeckis, after his CG adventures at the turn of the millennium. He's got some talent, but his screenplays and their authors need to be allowed to insert a bit more life and wit into the works. That being said, the final suspense sequences with Cotillard waiting for her husband in the car are so good, it comes close to being forgiven for its horribly muddled storytelling. Worth a watch for the middle Americans who want a gentle throwback to the thrillers of WW2 and Hitchcockian/Watergate-era paranoia alike."
" Inconseavable fable
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,4,"The movie is very well filmed. Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard do their job. The costumes and the war environment in the move are authentic. So there is just one small ""but"": the major premise of this movie is false, and that kills the entire feature. Nobody executes the caught spies out of court, and even before getting all the information from the spy. And absolutely nobody requests from a family member to kill his spying relative. In addition, Max Vatan committed serious crime by himself, killing in England (!!!) two people because he supposed that they were spies. He also committed an act of treason by trying to run away with his spying wife. So the final scene is also false because Max Vatan would probably serve a life sentence. This all sums up to an inevitable conclusion: the movie is a flop, and a childish exploit of a war theme. Has Hollywood spent all its talents?"
" My God! This was terrible, don't waste your time
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,1,"Typical, clichéd, boring and predictable. How many ""spy"" movies have you seen that make duty and honor become second to feeble human emotions. When will Hollywood learn that spies are specially trained professionals, they are not like regular people. If you are going to make a love story/family movie, why revolve it around spies and WW2? Moreover the events of the movie doesn't make any sense. If anyone of you has an understanding of wars, conflicts, politics and national duty, you will find this movie appalling. Character-building is the second worst thing in the movie, first is the acting (Brad Pitt is alright but rest of the cast is horrendous).

",2017-02-20 00:00:00,6,"AlliedCanadians received little recognition during WWII because everyone just assumed they were educated Americans.Admiringly, this thriller recognizes the Canucks contribution to the war-effort.Max (Brad Pitt) is a bilingual RCAF intelligence officer posted in Casablanca with instructions to assassinate the German ambassador. Marianne Beausejour (Marion Cotillard) is the French rebel posing as his wife, helping him carry out his orders.Married after the war, Max is shocked to learn one day that his now-pregnant wife is suspected of being a German spy. Convinced otherwise, Max helps the army conduct a sting operation in order to prove her innocence.While the story is a serviceable one with a scattering of half-decent action sequences and minor blips of post-war intrigue, it is Pitt's ham-fisted performance that undermines it all with his dopey French accent and incessant reference to Medicine Hat.Besides, why go to Medicine Hat when Nazis Germany is closer?

" nice little story, bad acting
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,2,"Dear Hollywood, kindly step outside, in the real world, to see how people actually speak. How they interact. How they pause, how they feel insecure when talking to another. Why not try to mimic that? Why cast Mr. Pitt to be Mr. Pitt over and over again? Why not cast someone who can actually be a character? How are we supposed to be told a story, when all we see is actors promptly reciting lines? Too bad for Mr. Steven Knight's script."
" Booooooring as hell
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,2,"So... supposedly Angelina thought Brad had too much chemistry with Marion in this movie and that's why she asked for divorce? I don't know how this could be possible because watching these two leads was literally like watching paint dry. After the first third of the movie I started to wonder how I managed to sit through it... and then came the rest.What's wrong with this movie? Almost everything. I was looking forward to watching it because I like both actors and this type of film, but actually both Pitt and Cotillard seemed like they weren't themselves - like they forgot how to act all of a sudden. They're both terrific actors so what the hell happened?The story itself was about I don't know what, to be honest. There were too many things happening that were just loosely connected, there was no real structure, no real drama or tension. It was more or less as 'dramatic' as the quite horrible 'Ask the dust' with Colin Farrell and Salma Hayek, which was also a badly acted melodramatic period piece with a terrible script. Visually the movie is beautiful and I understand why a lot of people like it: it's because it's not that obvious at first glance what's so wrong with this movie. It seems kind of good but then if you think about it a little, you realize it's actually just plain awful. The story is disjointed, the love between the leads doesn't look real at all, and the worst thing is that everything that the characters go through seems utterly pointless in the end. I just wanted to ask, what was it all about? What was the point of this drag? No idea whatsoever."
" Love and Espionage in WWII
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,7,"In 1942, during the World War II, the Canadian spy Max Vatan (Brad Pitt) goes parachuting to the French Morocco to meet the French spy Marianne Beauséjour (Marion Cotillard) that is posing of his wife in Casablanca. Their mission is to assassinate the German Ambassador in a reception. They live together for a couple of days and soon they fall in love with each other. When Max returns to his base in London, he brings Marianne and marries her. One year later, they have the baby daughter Anna during a bombing. One day, Max is summoned for a meeting in the feared V Section with his commander officer Frank Heslop (Jared Harris) and a secret service agent that tells that they suspect Marianne is a German Spy. Further, they will give a fake order to him to confirm whether Marianne is a spy or not. If she is, Max shall execute his beloved wife; otherwise they will be both executed. What will Max do?""Allied"" is a good film directed by Robert Zemeckis with a story with lots of action, romance and drama. The awesome performances of Marion Cotillard and Brad Pitt with magnificent support cast give credibility to the story. The beauty of Marion Cotillard is perfect for a story in the 40's. The scenes are very well balanced with intense action, romance and drama. The journey of Max Vatan to find whether his wife is a German spy or not is outstanding and the conclusion is magnificent. My vote is seven.Titles (Brazil): ""Aliados"" (""Allied"")"
" Not Epic, But Worthy of Watching!
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,7,"The film accompanies the story of Marianne Beausejour and Max Vatan meeting up in Casablanca to kill a German ambassador. After the mission is completed they fall in love and get married, having a daughter but just when everything seems to be right she is believed to be a German spy. The film lacks a decent script but is compensated on the structure, design, setting and by the performances of Pitt and Cotillard.I was waiting for a Mr. and Mrs. Smith type of movie but this is certainly different from that. While not epic, the movie is definitely worth watching and maybe forgettable but every time you'll remember it you won't have negative thoughts about it. The ending was the highlight of this movie. It ended just as it should had ended, giving the film a 'real-life' no way out scenario. Bravo for Pitt, he can still pull it off and he's definitely back! Cotillard as always delivering passionate and devoted performances. 7/10."
" This awakened emotions in me unlike LalaLand
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,9,"It's hard to define the genre of this film, but it was a decent romance and a decent thriller... Marion Cottillard makes every film a mystery. Some say there was no tension and they are wrong, nobody knew if she is a spy or not right until the end scene. I enjoyed every moment of this film from action scenes right until the ending credits. Quite likely the film will not get a single Oscar, but the story and performance were stellar. I felt deeply emotional at the end of the film. It will be sad if a fake romance of Lalaland will win anything over this suspense love story..."
" Surprisingly good
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,8,"I though it was surprisingly good. I think they kept things simple and movie was a little slow, but it recover at the end. Liked the plot as it was exciting and interesting, not like every other movie, they keep on edge until the end. Brad Pitt delivered an excellent performance and Marion Cotillard, somehow I couldn't believe her entirely, but was good as well."
" Searching for good WW II drama movie? Go watch it!
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,10,"Robert Zemeckis is fantastic director, who created good movies(for example - Forest Gamp.) Allied is one of these movies, there after watching it you can say ,,oh, that was a great movie!"" It's based on WW II events, so if you like war theme movies, you will be even more satisfied. The first part of the movie is kind of strange, romantic. But don't get the wrong idea - it was not bad. The second part was more intense and dramatic, witch make this movie one of my favorites!"
" 1 out of 10 movie at best
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,1,"Reading other reviews I wonder if we all watched the same movie. From the very beginning movie felt like a total disaster. With Brad and the maker of brilliant "" Forrest Gump""you will assume that you are in for a treat . How wrong was I. Absolutely wooden performance by all actors, terrible pacing, ridiculous decorations and laughable story that just does not make any sense. This movie does not deserve 1/10 rating. Whoever made this so-called movie should be really ashamed for making such a turd."
" Flashes of Brilliance but overall an unfulfilled masterpiece
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,7,"Firstly the goodies: This romantic WW2 flick brings back all the nostalgic memories of World War 2. Two gorgeous lead pair try and give all to make it an emotional saga. Brad and Marion look to be a match made in heaven :-)...the most natural and attractive screen pair (we should have many more flicks for sure). great visuals and Special Effects. Some obvious disappointments are: Brad looks surprisingly tired and no energy or passion in carrying out the required role...too restrained.. and looks quite aged even though his body is quite slim.. i couldn't see the vigor he used to display in his younger ones (he should have shown more passion and response given the circumstances as the role demanded). Marion's role is rather limited but dazzles whenever she is on screen (her background could have been explored further).. as the story doesn't have mystery or aura.. it all fizzles out and the climax is rather timid and no twists and turns (since it was not real and fiction, the story could have been tight and more interesting). Overall i felt the movie lacked that extra thrill and excitement which i definitely feel whenever i watch ""saving private Ryan"", ""the pianist"" or even ""enemy at the gates"". Just for the sheer moments of the protagonists we can absolutely enjoy this uncut gem."
" This movie helps to make the people of this era, more real
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,8,"This is definitely worth the watch, especially for people of a certain age, who have had or still have World War 2 era parents. The acting is excellent, and though the climax at the end is somewhat unrealistic, it is necessary for suspense purposes. I am worried that the somewhat unrealistic expectations of this film, will put off other talented directors, such as Robert Zemeckis, from making good interpersonal relationship World War 2 films. Some films such as Pearl Harbor, and Little Boy, failed in being realistic as far as script and the human element is concerned. This, and the movie Ithaca, succeeded.Where War is the backdrop that effects the he characters. Rather than being about the war itself.As World War 2 enters the final twilight of living memory, we are losing more and more of these people and their times. We who are left behind, struggle to understand them. In my case, and is widely known in most cases, these people are very closed mouthed about these times. For those like myself, well done World War Two relationship movies help us to maybe understand them a little better. Especially if they are now gone. This film succeeds admirably in that. Understanding these people when we were young, wasn't so important as it is now. As we ourselves age, and are further and further removed from those times, it takes on greater importance. Call me biased because of my own self interest, but I think that issue alone, allows me to give it an 8 instead of a 7."
" Just shy of great
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,7,"Solid movie with a great performance by Marion Cotillard. It's definitely a love story first and foremost, and a spy movie a distant second. Brad Pitt was a little hit or miss for me. Most of the time he was fine, but there were a couple scenes where he was doing little more than a table read of the script. It's probably a bit too long, but it doesn't drag by any means, just could have been tightened up a bit. Great chemistry (obviously) and well placed tension kept me locked in from start to finish. The emotion was there, but could have been captured so much better. This had the potential to be one of the best dramas of the year, but comes up shy of great."
" I didn't expect Casablanca, but it was not even a war love tragedy
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,6,"I blame the director,the script,the editors,and the carelessness about details. I love both main actors,- but here they are not coming through as believable.Marion Cotillard is a superb actress and even in this movie,she does her job,- but even she looks as trying too hard. Brad Pitt is supposed to be ""restrained"" and cool(after all he is a spy,and a pilot and a commander), but he is...absent,even in the love scenes; and in the end (that meant to be painful),he is not convincing.He seems as if his mind is somewhere else. The story has such great potential, and it is wasted! Their time in Casablanca seems too staged (I loved the costumes, so...); the meeting with the German ambassador is not trustworthy at all, and the attack lacks suspense and goes so smoothly..(empty streets all around, in an Arab city after an explosion; really?) London:the language is too modern, the behaviour of people-even considering the war-is not as open.Women openly together? maybe in Berlin before the Nazis,in Paris or even in London in bohemian circles,- but never like it was portrayed here(in the military?in the 40s?come on!). Even more annoying,- it added nothing to the story! So why I give it a 6.5? Because in general the story is good and has so much more to it(if it was other hands),because the small things-like Max's attempt to find the truth, showed a bit the ugly part of the war (when he sends the young pilot,when he meets Guy in the hospital),and Marion's acting is still worth notice. It is watchable, keeps you interested, but the holes in the story are too big to make you emotional and sympathetic with the characters (and I am a very emotional person), to make it a good movie. 6.5/10"
" Decent watch, could have been much much better
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,8,"The movie starts off very very slow. At times, the plot feels important as they try to build the characters and show nuances and characteristics for each protagonist, but overall, they fail to show a lot of important details in the plot and rather focus too much on the key characters.The second half is boring, with some interesting events here and there, but they barely keep the excitement and the thrill alive.Overall, a decent watch but had the potential to be much better if the plot was setup better and had more action or suspense at the end. This is another one of the movies where the expectation that if you have a popular star in one of the key characters, the movie will do well even if it lacks other important elements."
" Mostly Harmless
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,5,"Spy stories set in the 2nd world war are somewhat a genre by themselves, here we have one of the more psychological persuasion rather than an action packed one. It is in fact based on the intimate relationship between the two leads rather than their daring feats. Allied is a very average movie that would not involve you one bit in the fate of this couple. That is a striking achievement given all the talent in front and behind the camera.Allied should be studied and dissected in film schools as one of the most interesting oddities. Why money plus talent is success only on paper.Why the public is not compelled to care about these characters? The story in itself, if you had just the script in your hands, is not particularly original or well built but neither it is a dull and boring story. While genre and cultural clichés are constantly applied those do not necessarily undermine the result. There are no particularly strong plot points but sometimes is better safe than sorry. A bit of confusion towards the end if anything wrong. No smoking gun here.Photography is technically very good, some desert outdoors are even fascinating and French Morocco in the 40s is altogether well depicted, yet some of the cracks in this movie appear instantly: in its very classical and rigid framing you do not get personal with the actors, the camera is mostly going for medium and long shots, very well filmed and yet somehow distant and descriptive rather than immersive. Not what is needed, feels fake. Mind you, masterfully faked but still The acting is what really stops this movie from being a classic of its genre. Brad Pitt is a piece of stone sporting one of his worst acting feat. He has a terrible and unbelievable french accent, if you do not speak French I suppose it is endurable. Far worse are his reactions to events and pressure and worst of all his chemistry with Marion Cotillard. She pulls off an adequate performance but nothing more. Since the whole thing should be about what goes on between them the movie sinks. The whole seduction part goes nowhere and it is filmed from as far away as possible. The love scene might even work but is built on choreography alone and in the end does not have much impact. Supporting characters are mostly useless stereotypes without much to do.Allied is a quietly, pleasantly boring movie that will be soon forgotten for good. No Casablanca here."
" I don't... Why do p... How did this m... Why... Why? Just... Why.
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,1,"What is even happening?How did this movie ever manage to grow into anything past an abstract idea hastily aborted for ringing so... drab?Did any of the people involved want to be there?As the unnatural movements, wooden acting, and Benjamin Button SFX face would suggest, was Brad Pitt even physically present while filming this or did he have to be entirely superimposed? Did something happen, like... he had previous engagements, had to have brunch with friends and couldn't make it, so they had to hire someone to play Pitt against a green screen or something? In which case, did they even try for Andy Serkis before they slapped those sensors onto a wholly disinterested, pregnant panda?Is Matthew Goode even reading the contracts Hollywood is throwing his way before signing them?Is Steven Knight ashamed of his fingers for actually following his brain's dictation into the completion of this... authorial embarrassment?Was the editor full-on intoxicated for the duration of their task? Were they forced to edit with nothing but a pair of blunt scissors and two broken thumbs? Maybe the aforementioned bored, pregnant panda was asked to multitask?Did Marion Cotillard finally got around to firing her agent after this?Watching this nonsensical monstrosity completed for the first time, did Zemeckis at the very least have the decency to walk out in heavy, wet protest against this mortifyingly puzzling directorial disgrace?I have questions. And a headache. But mostly questions.I mean...What is even happening?!?"
" wonderfully romantic and entertaining
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,7,"Brad Pitt has never been a brilliant actor, he does what he does very well, but he is always Brad Pitt. That said you can't help but like him and the characters he plays. And this flick is no different, the stoic secret agent working behind the lines, calm in the face of danger. His leading lady also more than adequately plays her role. The pair drive the film along at a decent pace. At times the locations and sets appear a little unbelievable. And in the latter part of the film there are also a few kinks in the story line which suffer from the same problem. Just a few things that wander too far away from what is reasonably believable about the characters.That said this film narrowly misses being an 8/10. It's good, could be a little better, and ends in a slightly unsatisfying way. But overall it is well worth a watch. The first half is really excellent."
" What would Bogart have done?
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,2,"This story and its big drama is the kind of thing Humphrey Bogart did often after he had success with ""Casablanca"". That is not the only thing that connects this movie with Bogart; it is a very traditional, even well-worn, type of Hollywood movie. The Bogart fare was melodramatic and plotted very carefully and in those elements this film fails considerably.The story is small but as it goes it is rather dull, no other word for it, it is dull. It lacks drive and purpose and some unifying idea for the audience to connect with after the grace period, say 20 minutes, when we still don't know how it will develop.The writing is truly lamentable; if this is what it takes to get a movie deal now the product is bound to be awful The pitch meeting on the project would have been the most exciting thing because the execution, in the script and on screen is lifeless, aimless and lacking in drama.Then there are the anachronisms, the language Pitt uses to superiors, the way people greet each other, the sense that non one had the faintest idea of what the 1940s was like. The birth sequence deserves special citation: risible doesn't do it justice, it must be in the top 3 worst and ludicrous scenes ever shot in the last 40 years.As history is not what this film was really about when Pitt seeks to prove, or otherwise, his wife's veracity, and she has to pay a well-known national anthem, it seemed perfectly fine if she offered up some other tunes, for instance: ""Die Fahne-hoch"", ""Die Wacht am Rhein"", neither Pitt, nor the director, nor writer would have known the difference.And in the end it reaches it's terrible conclusion and delivers an unwanted epilogue which adds a mawkishness to the whole experience. It also signifies how bad the script was that it had to append such a long-winded and pointless conclusion to the work.It's lucky for Bogie that he never saw this, and its for sure that he would have passed on it, because he was a real professional who knew a dud if he'd been offered it."
" A classic take on the 40's romantic spy thriller....
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,7,"Allied offers up a classically styled, 40's romantic spy thriller.This is very much a ""by the numbers"" flick. That's not to say its a bad film but it has been done before and as such, its rather predictable from beginning to end. At least for veteran movie goers. Did I enjoy it? Yes I did. And, I guess that's the best litmus test of any film. Its a polished affair, with quality sets, effects and a top notch cast. At times, its a little syrupy but not enough to make you feel queasy. I will say, the overall premise is a little thin but its not so thin, as to be wholly unconvincing. In short, Allied is a competent film but by no means an exceptional one. Seven out of ten from me."
" Allied (2016)
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,6,"Robert Zemeckis is a good director who has been streaky as of late. He has some work that I really like but in recent years he's been forgettable. Judging by the trailers I wasn't very excited for this film. After viewing the film, I'll say that its better than I expected but could have been far better. Its still worth a watch and others may champion the picture more than I will.Marion Cotillard. What more can I say? I am so glad this extremely talented French actress switched over to American cinema. She's fantastic and magnetic in this film (as she always is). Two Days, One Night is a stellar film in which she showcases her talents. She does everything right in this film as well. I think the film could have been written better, but her character is still full of a sexual mystique and you watch as her truth unfolds. Although mysterious, her character is fulfilled and her relationship with Pitt on screen is charming. Pitt is also great in the film, the acting wasn't ever going to be a let down with these two.The plot progression is slow. I think once you get to the point where Marianne is accused of being a spy, the film picks up. Prior to that attention wanes, minds wander. There is action on the screen and the plot stays busy but feels lifeless at times. This is not a fault of the actors but seems like writing that doesn't provoke at large stages. This might have to do with the film focusing more on romance during wartime than being an espionage thriller. I think it could have used more of the latter to make for a more memorable experience. There are moments which are good but I felt like the film was uneven.Characters come and go, outside of the two leads everyone else is fleeting, not memorable, or just there to advance the plot. There's talent there like Matthew Goode and Lizzy Caplan but you don't really care about them because they are not around for long enough. Stuff just happens and lots of the film just feels tame and not as gripping as you'd expect from a World War II spy film. The film needed more suspense to really captivate the viewers but goes off on some tangents. I'm not saying the actors were wasted as the film isn't bad, its just that with better writing everything would have thrived. This one doesn't stack up to Zemeckis' best but its stylish, well acted, and has costumes and set pieces that take your eyes into a setting from WWII, although your mind is left to wander.6/10"
" A decent film marred by myriad subplots which provide little time for the good bits.
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,6,"Is it a special trait of wars which never fails to accommodate love somewhere amid the politics and enmity or is it the intrinsic nature of love which manifests even in the most inconceivable of times. One can sense a bit of the old Hollywood classic Casablanca in Allied which goes beyond the mere trivial similarity however falls short to emulate the former's cinematic excellence.Set during the World War II, Max Vatan, an intelligence officer and Marianne Beausejour, a French resistance fighter are disguising as a couple in a special situation to assassinate a German Ambassador. They fall in love as they spend time together and realize that they have little time left as the chances of surviving the mission are minimal. As the mission gets over, it is then we realize there is much more to come and what follows hardly matches up to the level of the what is done with in a haste to reach the real plot. Max invariably asks Marianne to be her wife and move to Hampstead with him. They get married and settle in England where they have a child. Anna. After a merry year, the story then changes tracks as Marianne is suspected of being a German Spy and Max, stuck in love, is adamant and goes extreme lengths to prove otherwise.Brad Pitt as Max gives a restrained, stoic performance and such subdued roles usually fail to leave an impression and more less so when they are matched up with somewhat flat characters. Yet he is convincing as an Air Force Officer and besides he need not any intense drama because he is friggin' Brad Pitt. Marion Cotillard is the highlight of this movie. She is seductive when she talks, she is elegant when she walks, and she fights expertly and dresses voguishly. She alights the screen with her unbridled charm. Every time she is in the frame we are immediately drawn to the screen and she constantly elevates the otherwise low-key movie to one with action and purpose. The other actors have played their roles with sincerity which is one of Allied's strengths. The period backdrop has been brought to life with intricate designing of the mise-en- scene. The color tone is deep with high contrasts and shades are not overblown with care to retain the realistic feel to it. The frames are composed from an apparently fresh vision which highlights in addition to the aesthetics but reveals candid beauty in the mundane and often overlooked little details. Casablanca city is pictured with both its scorching desert as well as the soothing cool starry night sky over the terrace. The costumes are tailored beautifully which looks glamorous and classy on the big screen, particularly those wore by Marianne and the scene where she turns up all for the party in the chic outfit is a treat. The whole production works together and sumptuously achieves the singular vision, albeit the visual one, laid by the director celebrated for the same.There was little emotional investment between Max and Marianne to speak of. They hardly shared any intimacy with each other. This may well have been a deliberate decision to further ground the film with reality but there was nothing to compensate for the lack thereof, which is felt more in a film which was oozing with beauty and glorious cast. The result-one is not yet ready to share their sorrows when they haven't shared their 'moments'. The tone and tempo are also flat throughout the runtime which explains the missing 'edge' and surprise factor. Due to an underwhelming treatment, an interesting story which could potentially be an instant classic has been reduced to a bland film which struggles with itself-never sure what it is which is trying to tell. The hurried love-affair, the hurried end, Allied is at its heart a dramatic love story wrapped in the tension-torn of the World War II which rapidly shifts between an espionage thriller at the beginning to a love story for some time and then to a mystery about halfway which is told through jittery transition with limited character focus thus the denouement falls short to have the impact it was meant to inflict and the end comes off as melodramatic when it shouldn't have.Yet, it keeps one's attention throughout its runtime credit to its actors, Marion Cotillard in particular, visual brilliance and overall technical perfection. The director Robert Zemeckis has made a decent film obviated by the subplots which used up much of the space leaving little room to build the interesting bits which the audience most cared about, like the love story and Marianne's anxiety about her future. Granted the subplots add newer dimensions to a story, but in Allied, Steven Knight, the writer, appears to be treading too many paths at once so he takes a long jump towards the end which lead to the destination at the cost of skipping the necessary steps. People who are looking for a period film or a visual treat shouldn't miss this one but keep in mind that being technically good doesn't guarantee an overall rewarding film."
" Barely watchable romantic drama
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,6,"This key plot twist takes almost an hour to occur and it's only at this point that things really kick into gear. Ahead of this the film struggles to take off thanks to Pitt and Cotillard's inability to spark off one other. Brad Pitt is cool through the first half of the film and Cotillard is charming, but as a pair they really don't work. They're not aided by a distinct lack of thrills in the first half, despite them staging a daring assassination in enemy territory. On the other side of the plot twist, things improve dramatically. The tension increases as there is more at stake, the married Max and Marianne have far more chemistry, with performances getting even better. Allied finally (at long last) gets a sense of purpose and its set-up starts to pay off."
" 7.5/10
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,7,"In 1942, a Canadian intelligence officer (Brad Pitt) in North Africa encounters a female French Resistance fighter (Marion Cotillard) on a deadly mission behind enemy lines, they join forces, disguised as husband and wife, but after spending precious time together, both realize that their fictitious roles might just be a truth for the both of them.When Robert Zemeckis makes a film I am sure to be there, he has graced the silver screen for four decades with quality pictures for worldwide audiences, always maintaining a romantic sensibility without ever loosing a masterful sense of filmmaking and storytelling. ""Allied"" is once again a solid, well told story that reaches for all audience out there.The film has a slightly sloppy introduction, it switches from solid moments that are building to something to poor character development with the two leads. Fortunately Cotillard and Pitt have enough chemistry and charm together that the audience just goes through the first act without really feeling the weight of the problems that fortunately eclipse with the main bulk of the film.As I said the two leads aren't well developed in the first half, whilst you get a very clear sense of who these two individuals are and what lengths they are willing to go for their cause, with some very surprising and raw scenes, you don't get a logical understanding of why they fall in love. Certainly you feel the connection, but the film never really shows you why the two start to appreciate each other, it doesn't build up their relationship rather than just introduce it.Still, when we get to the second act in London, much of this is erased thanks to some really good work by the actors and Zemeckis. They manage to, in a way, reintroduce us to the new lives of these people and we really buy them as a couple, Pitt and Cotillard go really far into their performances with one another and there is a sexual undercurrent to the whole film that whilst slightly sidelined does emphasize moments that make you understand this marriage deeply.So on a level of romanticism the film does trip in different moments with a slightly gratuitous build up of their relationship, but overall when you look at it moment by moment, there is no denying that it is, unsteadily, built up to actually some very intense emotional depth that is vital for the thriller aspect of the film to succeed.Which, transitively, it does and is probably the most fascinating aspect of the feature. The middle hour of the film is definitely its best moment and were it not for the lesser start and finish, it would have added up to a great film. The inciting incident comes far into the movie's length, but once it does it kicks off a relentless pace that keeps you on you toes, guessing for a very long time.Zemeckis manages to build tension upon tension in a master's way, the structure of the screenplay supports the veteran director into making a sequence of scenes that is a breathtaking, edge-of-your seat experience which mixes a very good emotionally deep component to the setting of World War II producing a miss-en-scene that captivates the viewer's attention. Every moment is built up with set-up, reminder and pay off and you are never lost in the mix, everything's always clear, the motivations are constantly solid and you route or the hero without reservations.Just as its partially uneven beginning, the finale of the film is a notch below its main focus. There are moments that hit home and Cotiallard gives her all in her last scenes, bringing some really intense performance work to the screen, but unfortunately the film just looses a little steam with a couple of coincidences and with an ending that doesn't really build onto a convincing climax, but rather to a more clichèd-romantic one.""Allied"" anyways remains an underrated romantic thriller with fantastic and lush settings that manage to bring to life a time and a place which support a story that has much flare to spare for any kind of audience."
" i loved it. romantic le carre style ww2 thriller.
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,9,"i agree with everything your initial reviewer has said. i loved it. would watch it again. beautiful photography and locations. i am a fan of old movies and this film was spot on. even brad pitt was convincing. i find he often is if partnered with a good actor. she of course, was terrific. authentic London blitz and France ww2 scenes. a romantic le carre style spy thriller. it is a good film. we don't get enough of this type of film. with an ageing population filmmakers are missing the point. drama based on real incidents with a mixture of humour/romance/thriller or charming romance/thriller are very popular and we see so few of them. why are all films aimed at the young? do you imagine the over 60's are too frail to leave the house? remember, we are the old 50. we have time, money and don't party - we dine out and go to films. we are more likely to visit a cinema as we grew up going to the movies before videos and dvds were invented. you have a captive audience and you don't write for them. this is a good site. thanks for the opportunity to review this film. by the way La La Land was boring. where was the spark, the music, the choreographer."
" Quite good
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,8,"This movie is very well done I thoroughly enjoyed it and would watch it again. It is a pleasant experience. It creates a world and every character in it fits perfectly into it and also takes you into the world as well that when you start watching it you feel you are transported into the ambiance and feeling the of the place it's set in.It is also very aesthetically pleasing. Very elegant, warm, loving and beautiful. Beautiful and handsome actors, colourfully rich and interesting setting and complementing dialogues between the main characters. There is a good balance between the simplicity of how the events unfold and the depth of emotions presented. There are definitely room for improvement and some less interesting scenes but it didn't stop me from enjoying the movie as it is. Pitt and Cotillard do a wonderful job creating their own characters and also to create the couple that they were, makes them totally believable allowing the audience to enjoy the ebb and flow of the husband and wife dynamics."
" Watching Brad Pitt on the big screen in his brown jacket and smart cut feels exhilarating
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,8,"Went to watch the film as it was the only English film (other than Passengers which had terrible reviews) in theater. Didn't expect much as I read before going that it was a world war 2 romantic drama. But I was very surprised at the action, the espionage scenes. Moreover it was great fun to watch how they had recreated the early 20th century world war 2 environment, the costumes, the music and the get ups (especially Brad Pitt Man!!). The cinematography of the film was really good.I didn't seem to find any loop holes in the story and felt that the film was well directed and had a good story.It is a really good film for a one time watch. Some of the espionage scenes did give me chills."
" A Shallow Pitt
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,3,"Just like Fury, Allied is another Pitt Special - a war comic that wants to be taken seriously.Apart from the wooden acting and the extremely long scenes of just talking, this slow moving script that was probably written by a ten year old is just so unbelievable.Please note that lots of spoilers follow.Why did Mr Pitt have to parachute into Casablanca? As a spy, he could have been much less conspicuous and caught the train.If his wife to be is such a careful and clever spy - as we are led to believe, why did she put Pitt's character on the spot by saying he was a poker specialist?We then have the spectacle of Pitt's character cutting the cards like a professional magician (yawn), and off course being able to write down complex chemical compounds - in line with his cover. It appears that for a one minute assassination job, he has had around five years training. Is there anything he can't do?If the British secret service think his wife is a spy, why tell him? Why not just bait the trap anyway!.The German soldiers are all presented as being zombie like gun fodder, when they actually were one of the most disciplined and efficient armies. In real life, Mr Pitt's character wouldn't have got very far after attacking the Germans in the town. Reinforcements would have flooded the area.The anti aircraft fire over London was obviously taken from the bombing of Bagdahd in the 21st century. If you watch YouTube clips of WW2 London AA fire it looked nothing like that.Why would you have a picnic next to a plane crash? Apart from the smell of aviation fuel, there would have been dead bodies in the wreckage.There are so many more stupid things in this movie, but I will just present my favourite for last.Mr Pitt turns into a Jedi near the end when entering the airfield with his wife and child. The guard commander comes to the car window, I can imagine Brad waving his hand, and the Commander then says words to the effect ""They can pass.""If you are thinking of paying to watch this movie, I would pass too."
" Subtle, romantic, beautifully crafted and acted
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,9,"My husband and I both enjoyed this movie. It had been a while since we had seen Brad Pitt in a movie and he is an accomplished actor. His costar was beautiful and talented. They made for good eye candy as a couple. There was plenty of action across two different settings and times. It was not predictable or spelt out for you which is often the case with American movies, The English seem to do a better job of allowing the audience to fill in some gaps and silences. It kept us interested and entertained throughout. Cinemaphotography was good with colours and weather helping with the mood and atmosphere. For people who favour the spy genre set in wartime it is worth a few hours of your time. It is a serious film that shows that love transcends everything!"
" Thrilling with too much Hollywood
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,7,"What if you'd be faced with the question if the love of your life is trustworthy out of the blue? That's what ""Allied"" asks us. It tells us the story of a Canadian soldier, who worked against the Nazi regime in Morocco and fell in love with the french agent that helped him doing so. Back home, they soon get married and a family but everything could be at risk when unappealing questions about the past begin to arise.This movie offers us a real nightmarish scenario, a reality in which we don't know anymore who can be trusted. It thus carries great potential to tell a different story of the war, a very individual one. While in my opinion, Allied is definitely a great movie, what prevents me from giving it the full stars is that at times, especially during the end, everything just seems to be a bit too unreal, too Hollywood for me to take it as granted. I wonder if a bit more of an art-house approach could have benefited the movie, but now that's speculations.A movie worth watching, but not a must-see for me."
" Refreshing change - it's about the story and the characters
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,9,"What an enjoyable WW2 movie. The tone and content of this movie is a right step in the direction of having the story and characters at the forefront in a Hitchcock way vs the violence of battle. There have been enough gut wrenching war movies concentrating on big battles and close ups on injuries so this is a refreshing change of perspective. Some action type WW2 movies have been getting ridiculous in recent years. In fact some of the best and most tense WW2 movies made in the 50s and 60s were spy movies that didn't feature too much fighting.The story is suspenseful enough in it's own way. The 2 leads collaborate on a mission to kill a German diplomat in Casablanca. By the way they do look pretty glamorously fitted out. Then they fall in love, marry in London and start a family but she comes under suspicion for being a German spy. There are a couple of fight scenes for those hungry for that in a war movie but it's the relationship of the couple that is the crux of the movie. The production values are good with a purposely slightly artificially clean look. Although it has the color palate, costumes and look of an older Hollywood Golden Age WW2 movie it isn't old exactly fashioned.A couple of slightly ludicrous plot points don't spoil the story too much. Like his totally whipped flight to Dieppe to ask the drunkard. Why didn't the people vetting her show her photo to witnesses who knew her like he was doing? There are some memorable scenes as well. The love scene in the desert storm, the birth in middle of the Blitz, are all quite unique in case you think you have scene it all. The ending wasn't too much of a surprise but it's good there wasn't some silly twist. A bit more explanation by her would have helped at the end.Brad is alright - a little puffy in the face but his French accent isn't good enough to fool anyone. His makeup to make him look younger makes his face a bit stiff. Marion is suitable for the role and looks good in costumes of the era. It's good that Hollywood is looking to the past for inspiration like in La La Land. There are so many good stories still to be told."
" Predictable
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,2,"I should have figured out the ending just by watching the trailer. The trailer hints that the wife might be a spy. What if she is not? Then the whole movie would fail.The only question left is; what will the husband do? That might be the only thing not predictable about this movie. Simply said, not worth watching if you're looking for a thriller.The acting is also mediocre, at least by the main characters. Any good about the movie? It is nicely shot in Casablanca and the fight in the sky is cool.It also gives you a sense that wars are meaningless. In summary; don't expect too much and don't spend money going to the cinemas for this one."
" Emotional War Scars
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"Living a normal, peaceful life proves impossible for an intelligence officer and the French Resistance fighter he married in this World War II drama from Robert Zemeckis. While a solidly made motion picture with good performances from Marion Cotillard and Brad Pitt, the film opened to mixed reviews, which is unsurprising given how misleading the trailers for the film are. From the trailers, one is positioned to expect a paranoia thriller centered around the question of whether or not Cotillard is an undercover spy, whereas in actuality this twist only occurs around halfway in. While this does admittedly lead to a second half that is more tense and exciting than the first half, the first half of the movie is still worthwhile as the dynamics between Cotillard and Pitt build amid a turbulent wartime setting; a birth scene during an air raid is particularly evocative. The film's denouement probably also contributed to the lukewarm critical response as it bares such a striking similarity to 'Casablanca' that it is impossible to avoid comparing the two films. Viewed as a motion picture on its own though, 'Allied' is just as an exciting an emotional roller-coaster ride as one would expect from a script by 'Dirty Pretty Things' and 'Eastern Promises' screenwriter Steven Knight. Pitt delivers a particularly fine turn as doubts and uncertainties cross his mind with more conveyed through his stares and sullen looks than words could ever offer. By the end, he comes across as a man indelibly affected by the tidings of war despite having never really fought at the frontlines himself."
