" Ritesh Deshmukh is show stealer
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,8,"Loved it, a good thriller movie plus acting of cast is also good(shraddha & sid improved a lot)
Music album of this movie is worth keeping.The fight sequence at the dockyard on boat is captured very well."
" Good movie
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,8,It's not best from Mohit Suri but still it's a good movie. Direction is awesome and acting is little bit average but villain is positive In this movie. It's a good one time watchable movie.
" Good,must watch,emotional,sad film of all time
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,10,"Those people who are saying it is a bad,boring,worst film are don't like Indian romantic thriller film or they like only korean movies like I saw the devil,.It is a good must watch film. Watch it for it's good songs,lead pair,emotional and heart touching story. One time I think that in this generation Bollywood only makes dancing film or films with party songs,but ek villain is the film which has none of them,it has good,romantic,emotional songs and all of them are my favourite. Please watch this,It will touch your heart and will make you cry."
" Total plagiarism of a hard mans work.
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,4,"Unfortunately, this movie was totally ripped of from the Korean movie ""I SAW THE DEVIL"". If you ask someone of for the summary the person will give the you the same exact concept story which it was copied from. Totally disappointed on how the Bollywood could only rip off from others work."
" Best Action and Romantic Movie
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,10,"This movie make me feel so emotional , Siddharth malhotra and Shraddha kapoor work great and there chemistry in this movie make people so understanding."
" Straight from the Korean Movie ""I saw the Devil""
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,1,"Ek Villian is a 100% copy of the movie ""I saw the Devil"". Korean version is very Gruesome and cruel. Whereas, Mohit Suri did a perfect job of cultural appropriation of the movie to Indian Standards. I don't think it is an adaptation of the Korean version because when you produce film from other cinemas you have to buy the rights of the film and adapt it according to your needs. This is straight away copy. Just like Avenger bought the rights of Hulk and adapted the character of Hulk according to their needs. This is abject stupidity and fooling innocent Indian audiences who don't see international movies."

I loved it tho"
" Beautiful movie
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,9,"Many says this is disappointing and not as expected.everyone should that mentality on this perspective.overall this movie is brilliant and mohit suri proved once again.
If something unacceptable happens means that doesn't mean that movie is bad.
(it is the plot of the movie)"
" Recommended üëç
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,7,"Everything as fine, until I started seeing the typical ""love"" pattern, Bollywood nowhere stops, wheather it it a Horror movie, a traumatizing movie, a inspiring movie, they put ""love"" literally EVERYWHERE! >:("
" Just go for it !
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,8,"If you guys want to feel the beauty of love, this is the movie to watch. I fell in love with the way the lead characters were framed in the picture. Especially Sid when looking at shradhaüíû..wow what a look manüòç..Shradha was adorable and pleasing to watch the whole filmüòç. Sid was good but not at his best. He has to improve himself for villain expressions. He was giving the same expression throught the film may it be a love scene or a fight scene.But otherwise the lead couple were the cutest pair i have ever seen. No words to explain Ritesh's acting. He was simply rocking the roleüî•. Never expected that he can fit himself perfectly for a villain role. The film has many loopholes but still, you won't mind much. Afterall you will be curiosly waiting to see what happen's next. Songs and bgm were amazing and pleasant to hear.üëå
If you guys want to watch something different, just watch this movie. It will give you a feeling of mixed emotions.
If it were not for Sid's same expressions and some impractical parts (like shradha got cured from serious cancerüòë), I would have given 10 stars."
" All Time Favorite
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,10,"I don't know why but this movie will be my favorite forever...
Siddharth, Shraddha Kapoor,Ritesh, Mohit Suri you completely nailed it..
Music of the film will be on of the best album of the decade.."
" Beautiful movie...
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,6,Riteish and Shradha can steal your movie-loving heart with their performances while Sidharth is average....Recomended for KRK fans too
" Ok type movie
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,7,Look this is the remake of korean film i saw the devil.But there was not 20% flavour of i saw the devil.They made it totally in their way.Not too bad but ek villain contained a lot of mistake and the director can made it better than this one.But the acting of Ritesh was too good.So you can watch film.
" Be ashamed of yourself for copying blatantly
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,1,Have the decency to be honest where it's copy ed from. When will Bollywood learn
" Watch it for Sidharth, Shraddha and Riteish. A total entertainer
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,7,"Loved the movie. Especially Sidharth Malhotra, Shraddha Kapoor, Riteish Deshmukh were fantastic in their roles. However Ritiesh was my pick in the movie. He was simply outstanding a the villian. Sidharth was exceptional, his character has style and he pull it off very well. Shraddha was the cute one."
" Ek Villian
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,7,Extraordinary Mind Blowing Movie Dialogue Are So Powerful .... Direction Was Supp...
" A good adaptation Of I Saw The Devil
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,6,"Ritiesh Deshmukh's performance and songs are thw backbone of the movie!
Direction: Mohit suri as always did his best and didn't disappointed us.
Acting: Siddharth and Shraddha did good but Ritiesh steal the show.
Overall, a worth watch but compared to I saw the devil, Ek villain is nothing."
" Story is totally awesome.
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,10,Ek villain is totally awesome movie directed by mohit suri packed with fully romantic songs which are original means not any ruined old song. There is no song which sing by kakkar family members and that's what i like about mohit suri's movies. Arijit singh and ankit tiwari done awesome job in songs section.Its been 6 years since movie released but its looks like its been 6 month old. Best story and best cast. Loved it.
" Best movie
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,10,It's a really nice movie.This movie will always be my favorite.
" Good story
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,7,I like this movie because of riteish deshmukh is the way act of movie it was incredible
" Nothing new
",2019-09-05 00:00:00,2,It's a slow paced predictable story. Sometimes it turns in unnecessary directions. Not worth watching.
" Solid Revenge Film
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,7,"A former criminal marries a beautiful women who has helped him turn his life around only to see her die at the hands of a serial killer. This reignites his dark tendencies and he must take revenge.I ended up really liking this film. It has a decent amount of thrills, romance and self conflict. It is filmed and acted well. If I had to name an issue with it, it would have to be the music. This may be the way all films that come out of India are made but it seemed that the film was being dragged out for the music. It sorta felt like watching a music video at times. I'm not saying they were bad songs because I speak english, didn't understand the words and therefore I feel it would be unfair to say they were bad.The film has been loosely based on ""I Saw The Devil."" (Which, by the way, is an awesome film!) However, it doesn't bring a sense of sadism that is prevalent and overwhelmingly draws you in as what is portrayed in ""I Saw The Devil.""So, my takeaway is that it was a good film that was a bit slow due to the music and while it isn't, in my opinion, as good as ""I Saw The Devil"", it has enough going on to be watched as a stand alone film. I say check it out."
" You will enjoy songs only
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,5,"Despite of the commercial success of movie, the movie is not so good. The songs are good but the storyline consists of many plotholes just like potholes in first scene."
" Good thriller but supporting cast is bad
",2018-10-02 00:00:00,7,"The of story of the is fantastic because it is borrowed from South Korean movie and background score and location are also good.Tari galliyain is the best song in the movie.But one thing which I dont like about Mohit Suri's movies is the supporting characters.They r wierd and load.Like the charecter played Ceaser ,Guru's boss,hos dialogue delivery is pathetic and the doctor whom guru visited for shradha's treatement he was screaming unnecessarily and the police office he was monotonous in delivering the dialuges."
" Wow
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,10,"Awesome movie first film to watch of Hindi ..after long time after watching this I watch more Hindi films...
Awesome acting....
Music is all time best"
" Really well-made, an unforgettable movie.
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,10,One of the best love stories ever made in Bollywood. Mohit Suri brought out tremendous inner acting skills of Sidharth Malholtra. The music is heart-touching.
" Bollywood being Bollywood really. This movie may be a commercial success but Bollywood has failed miserable in terms of remakes.
",2018-05-25 00:00:00,1,"The first time when I saw the trailer, I felt I think I know this story and I was trying to recall the movie which had the same concepts, then I remembered ""I saw the Devil"", a South-Korean epic movie which is one of my favourite movie of all time. Well, guess what, after watching ""Ek Villain"" like after 25 minutes, I walked out in disgust. I was totally gutted. Bollywood has always been poor in terms of everything. This proved everything in just one movie. No innovative ideas, no self creation, no effects, no good actors. Bollywood keeps betraying people by cheating. If the movies can't be remade better than the original, then these pathetic Bollywood should stop making remakes. If anyone is thinking to watch this movie, then they should better watch the original Korean movie ""I saw the Devil"" before or after, anytime, South-Korean movies are too good. After you watch the original, you will spit on this movie ""Ek Villain"". You will know you are betrayed. No wonder why movie piracy in India is more fair to be honest."
" Ek Villain: Comes nowhere near I Saw the Devil, but has its own moments.
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,7,"I have seen I SAW THE DEVIL. It's an action thriller, and is definitely one of the best revenge movies ever. When I found this film, EK VILLAIN, was a ripoff of ISTD, I decided to watch it, to find out the similarities and differences. I found a lot of them.EK VILLAIN comes nowhere near ISTD and completely misses the charm of a revenge themed movie even as a standalone film. I was surprised to see a lot of scenes directly lifted from the original and was shocked to see a below par execution in many of these. But the film did have its own cool moments, like the stylish action sequences and some emotional aspects even the original didn't explore, apart from the striking and haunting performance of Riteish Deshmukh.Sidharth does a good job and looks handsome enough to fit in the character, but some poor dialogue delivery by him makes one of the best scenes unintentionally funny. Riteish is the biggest reason why this film works. His performance is the finest I've seen in years from him, given that he mostly acts in comedies. Shraddha was just fine; her dialogues never seemed to end, and while this was perhaps done on purpose, it seemed overdosed.The songs are excellent, but they pop out of nowhere and prove to be a hindrance in the screenplay. Then what makes this film a good one?Well, the film impresses emotionally too. The interval sequence is extremely well crafted. The entire confrontation between the hero and villain is excellently done, even though it doesn't excite too much if you've seen the original. The entire sequence before, during and after the climax, however turns out to be a game changer and makes the film good enough. The intensely poetic climax is excellent and at this point the film becomes unforgettable. There are some decent moral lessons too.If you want to see it only to judge which one is better out of the two, then it's clearly ISTD all the way. However, if you want a slightly lighter (in terms of violence and gore) action thriller with (unnecessary, unwanted) romance and songs, EK VILLAIN is the film to check out."
