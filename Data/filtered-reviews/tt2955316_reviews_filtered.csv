" A movie we need to see if we can understand Spain.

" Very enjoyable!
",2018-04-10 00:00:00,6,"I really enjoyed this. I'm a big fan of romantic comedies even though most provide many eyeroll moments. They can put a smile on my face, and this did. Very lighthearted. It plays into every romcom trope! From ""we have to pretend to kiss"" to ""we have to share a bed"", they had it all. Nothing is even close to realistic, and there's very little depth, hence 6/10 despite my enjoyment.As an American, I took some time beforehand to read up on Basque country which really helped me get the jokes more. I would recommend this if you like romcoms, foreign films, and getting a taste of other cultures. (Really what WAS up with her hair though?!)"
" Best movie ever!
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,9,"8 BASQUE SURNAMES This romantic comedy was released in 2014 by the director Emilio Martinez-Lazaro. The main characters of this family-friendly film are played by Clara Lago, Dani Rovira, Carmen Machi and Karra Elejalde. It is a love story between two people who live in different parts of Spain, one is from the south and the other one from the north. Rafa, who lives in Sevilla, goes to Amaya's village for trying to make her fall in love with him.This film is said to be the best Spanish film ever because it shows the different topics from each part of Spain, making us laugh about our defects. In addition, the actors have managed to learn different accents, which make it extremely funny. On the other hand, it may be annoying for people from the north of Spain because of its jokes are about them. Although it is the funniest film I have ever seen, unless you're Spanish it's hard to understand. When it was released, Spanish cinemas were very crowded, beating the record of the most tickets sold. I would recommend this terrific film to all Spanish speakers, I reckon you must watch this film at least once in your life!"
" Ocho Apellidos Vascos
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,9,"This movie is one of the best Spanish comedies I have seen. i have to say that I'm Spanish and I watched this in the theater and I couldn't stop laughing.The story follows Rafael (Dani Rovira), a Sevillian who has never left Andalucia, who decides to leave his homeland to follow Amaia (Clara Lago), a Basque girl he has fall in love with. The story may seem quite clich√© and maybe it is but the truly important part of this movie are the four main characters. They all have a very good chemistry. Dani Rovira and Clara Lago did it very well in the roles of the wannabe couple and they provided very funny moments and Carmen Machi was also very funny but the true star in here is Karra Elejalde who plays the basque father of Amaia and he delivers some very amusing moments with Dani Rovira.The Basque Country and Andalucia are very well captured in here with some very beautiful shots of both places. The music by Fernando Velazquez is both emotional and funny with the use of many Spanish typical sounds.This movie probably is for Spanish people because if you're not familiar with all the stereotypes and jokes and problems we have in here you probably won't enjoy the movie the half as I did, but for me it was really amazing. It specially great to watch in it's original version so I recommend you to watch in Spanish to hear all the accents and so."
" Forgettable TV-style local-jokes movie
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,5,"This movie was a huge box office event in Spain, but is not an interesting film at all, especially if you aren't Spanish. It's basically a dull Romantic Comedy full of current jokes about local topics. Directing is even worst than script, with some really poor acting performances (others are quite good), and shooting, cinematography and sound typical of a soap opera."
