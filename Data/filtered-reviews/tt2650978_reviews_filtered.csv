" Best watched WITHOUT reading the story first..
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,8,"..as it will intrigue you at least the first hour. Afterwards enjoy reading the spoilers, as I'm tempted to write one myself but this way it might help more (not that anyone will read my words, the film has plenty reviews)Anyway, great to see a internationally marketed film made in original language, with subs. But worth the little but of reading while watching.
Great scenery and setting, wintery mountains which could be in the americas as well (who often forget there were folks already living in hilly Europe like Clondike Joe and Trapper Sam long before these two grew a bushy beard. Well, yes some do still live like that nowadays in these alpine mountains ;)But saying that and back the movie, lets not forget to mention the mighty Winchester, which plays an intruduced species, coming Back from the americas to do what evasive species do - surprise the native population."
" Surprisingly Great
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,8,"While it is a slow burn thriller, it managed to keep my attention the whole way through. The beautiful scenery, cinematography and sound design add to a basic, but effective, revenge plot. While it has its faults, a few strange edits and the subbing, the rest of the movie more than makes up for me. Dont trust the rotten tomatoes score, its well worth a watch."
" Good old-skool Western ~ give it a go
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,8,"Fab scenery, acting and camera angles.
Your typical Western plot.
Some naff music to start but some great tracks during the action.
At the end we felt we'd stumbled on a really good movie."
" Loved it...negative reviews can't be trusted
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,8,It's really a shame that people may miss out on gems like this film and others because of turd burgler reviews. I suggest watching with original language and English subtitles. Dub overs ruin authenticity for me.
" OK
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,6,OK. Cowboy in Europe makes this somewhat different. Not bad. I liked the characters but they were somewhat depressing. I guess that goes with the title.
" Great story until the end. Not my kind of revenge.
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,5,"The movie was great throughout until the ending. I love revenge movies. But I watched this revenge movie only to get a ridiculous angry ending. I'm still mad!! Why wasn't he more angry at the man who killed his father? And why did he act so damn obedient at the end to that killer? Apparently, he was not mad enough and didn't want the killer to suffer like his father, or from the stupid storyline, his mom's dead husband who was actually not his real father? I'm still so mad! Stupid ending. I would've shot his penile first and let him bleed to death. Sorry, that would've been my revenge. And the stupidity that Brenner was his actual father made me dislike this movie so much, regardless of the great acting, cinematography, directing, and such."
" Dark Valley
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,8,"The movie was solid. It had a steady, growing tension pace. Did not talk too much, had beautiful scenery, main characters spoke without saying words, the whole thing felt like a classic western. No, the opening music was not my favorite part but certainly the fiddle (violin) songs/thematic music was beautiful and haunting. This was a great change from the usual noise in Hollywood. Loved it. Watched it on Amazon Prime. Did wish it was in the original German NOT dubbed to English, that looks silly. But, great movie to watch if you are not expecting something like The Transformers, cackle cackle!"
" I can't even make out what they're saying
",2020-01-21 00:00:00,1,Just mumbles. I'm sure there's a story here but I just don't get it.
" Slower than slow
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,1,"The plot of this movie is so slow, I walked to my mail box 3 blocks away and back and didn't miss a thing. Painfully slow is saying it nicely."
" How is this a Western
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,5,"He kills unarmed and wounded people who aren't threatening him.
He is just doing this for revenge.
Lot's of gore.
Classic US Westerns never had that. Even in the few driven revenge driven ones, the ""good guy"" eventually realizes revenge is futile, as in ""Nevada Smith"".
In a classic Western , the good guy sheriff might knock off the leader and at most his most heinous henchman in a classic gun duel, then the rest of the gang runs off or comes around to the side of good. In the classic winter western, ""Day of the Outlaw"" the heroic anti-hero doesn't kill anyone, just beats one of the baddies in a fist fight.
This is more like a ultra-violent spaghetti western knock off of classic Westerns than a Western. More like a snowy Gothic revenge drama than a western.
The only thing that makes it interesting is its Alpine Austrian location and set. It also has good production values.
Oh, not even one six shooter was used. So how is this a western again?"
" Its a revenge film thats all you need to know!
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,8,"Dark and gloomy everything a modern Gothic horror should be with a splash of 'Pale Rider'.
Sam Riley is so good and I just love Tobias Moretti as the lead henchman ,as is the rest of the cast. Wonderfully filmed and shot.
To say it is an European Western is to over simply it and an insult to actual Westerns! Admittedly there are horses and guns but so much more......"
" The Dark Valley Shines Bright
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,8,"A revenge western movie in the Alps. How cool sounds that!? The Dark Valley got finest cinematography, a never old growing story about revenge, rough characters living a rough life in some very remote place in the Alps, beautiful landscapes, on top we get a top production + excellent acting performed by Sam Riley and the whole cast . Thumbs up for this fine and exceptional addition to the genre of western and drama. Watch. Pronto."
" Excellent photography
",2019-02-11 00:00:00,7,"A somber,dramatic tale with stunning photography. The style is Clint Eastwood-esque backed by the photography."
" A poetic punch in your guts
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,10,"I had it on my list for a long time - should have seen this one much earlier. A depiction of how cruel life could become in remote rural areas of the alps in a time not that far away.
Surpressed feelings, an enclosed society driven by a harsh hierarchical structure, enforced by shameless people. A western in the alps? A storyline like punch in your guts? This is your pick!
An almost poetic take, leaving blood and gore for the most crucial parts and not as a story driver. 10s across the board."
" Climax Fizzled
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,6,"Comes close to being the Austrian answer to Clint Eastwood.
I didn't think the religious segment was necessary. When you want your audience to feel suspense and the motivation for revenge, you don't need to confuse them with a viewpoint of corruption from a priest standing in front of a life-size crucifix or Christus. (Although it works in a specific genre of horror.)
That scene for me was the beginning of disappointment. Many of the storyline decisions from that point veered from taking me to a gripping showdown.
Let filmmakers explore emotions.
Avoid formulaic drivel.
BUT, stay true to the direction that first got me hooked!
The final showdown.... wasn't.
Still, the concept and the cinematography are worth the price of admission."
" FREEDOM IS A GIFT NOT EVERYONE LIKES TO RECEIVE
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,10,"This is a ""western"" that takes place in the Alps. In the opening scene we see a woman being taken and a man being killed in an unknown village. Later a young American man, who can speak German, rides into a logging village located just below the tree line. He is an unwelcome stranger who simply wants to takes photos. He pays a healthy sum for lodging. He has a picture with him of his mother. His father died while he was young.Pretty soon you start to piece together events, even before they are explained...i.e. it is not that difficult from the clues. Even though we know may have figured out the mystery, the film still interests us because our stranger (Sam Riley) does not appear to be much of a fighter and is out gunned and out manned. Good film for those who like a western, or toned down action film.No adult language, sex, or nudity."
" Excellent
",2018-08-08 00:00:00,9,"There aren't many Westerns made today; let alone of good quality. With superb acting and directing, The Dark Valley should go down as one of the best. Timing and scenery are used well."
" A Breath of Fresh Air for Westerns
",2018-06-22 00:00:00,7,"Das Finstere Tal is much more than a Western shot in Austria. Apart from the excellent production values and the competent performances, it features a clever and deep plot, that combines prominent features of classic Westerns (i.e., outlaws and oppressed villagers) regarding a mysterious tale about a foreigner set out for revenge. The characters - first and foremost Greider - are complex and interact in a meaningful way, making their desires and intentions very tangible. Therefore, the movie succeeds both on a formal level and on a content level: the mysteries and the dark secrets of the villagers resemble the outer features of the valley, accentuated by great cinematography and the impressive scenery.Full review on movie-discourse.blogspot.com"
" bit overrated, good fist half, some illogical actions
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,6,"Was slow and decent.
didnt like english songs.
had problems wt the illogical actions the main protagonist did.
with a better second half script and better soundtrack, this movie would have been 8+
check out Ravenous !"
" Missed out on a great alternate ending
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,8,"If Greider had really hated the old man as much as we were led to believe, he should have denied the old man's request to ""make it quick."" He should have dragged him out to the cross and crucified him as was done to Greider's ""father"".Then, as Luzi said, ""left him hanging there until there was nothing left."""
" Excellent foreign Western
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,7,"'Das finstere Tal', or 'The Dark Valley', is an excellent Austrian revenge Western and one of the best foreign language films I've watched recently. I'm surprised that this film didn't even get nominated for best foreign picture of 2014 because, unless 2014 was an abnormally strong year for foreign films, I can't imagine there being many better than this.Everything about 'Das finstere Tal' has the feeling of a high-end, mega budget production. The cinematography is outstanding with some breathtaking shots of the Austrian alps, where the film is set. I also liked the narration and the film has some really cool music, especially during the shoot-outs. Overall this is a very slick production. An excellent foreign Western that deserves a lot more recognition."
" Remarkable!
",2017-07-16 00:00:00,8,"I have just finished this movie and it is truly remarkable. I really enjoy independently produced westerns and this is one of the best. It goes a bit slow but it is worth ii to stay through it until the end. For a western fan, it will not a disappoint.What attracted me to this was the idea of a western set in the Alps of Austria or Germany. It was never clear about that but it does not matter. I don't want to make a spoiler but as I said, this is SET in the Alps and not just shot in the Alps as an American western.This is a genre of westerns that I would like to see more of and that is the American Cowboy or Cowgirl placed in a foreign environment. The Dark Valley stacks up well with Quigley Down Under (Australia). Hidalgo (Saudi Arabia),and The Castaway Cowboy (Hawaii) although the last was a comedy. What I have enjoyed about all of these flicks is how the American cowboy has to adapt to the environment to survive and prevail. I hope there are more such westerns like that out there or maybe someone will be inspired to explore this sub genre. I have never seen Africa:Texas Style but that was a ""modern"" western and I am not too crazy about those except that I did like Longmire. Good job everyone."
" A ""Western"" with a difference - Das finstere Tal
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,8,"The main difference with this western is it is set in a remote valley in the European Alps. Western genre more than western.At times I thought I was going to be watching another version of Pale Rider (1985), but it was probably more like Unforgiven (1992) meets Deliverance (1972).It is a film that keeps the dialogue to a minimum, and doesn't dig unto the characters personality in depth, but I think that works in this context.A German/American (Greider) rides into to a remote mountain village as a photographer, but there is a hidden agenda. He also hides a Winchester repeating rifle; the locals only have breech-loading rifles.The dominant family in the area are the Brenners. As things develop confrontations, and vengeance comes into play.A really good watch. The Austrian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 87th Academy Awards."
