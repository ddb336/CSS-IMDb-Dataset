" Poots took off two stars
",2021-03-03 00:00:00,2,"Great concept but just never got where it could. The character of Jess is obnoxious and annoying. Imogene Poots seems to play the same character often... perhaps she is obnoxious and annoying.
No character development just they 'changed'
Urgh"
" Painful and boring
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,4,"It has a very interesting and promising start, however, afterwards, it descends into an overly boring drama, full of stereotypes, such as music to make you cry, self-help speech, happy ending. The only thing that is saved in the whole film is the performance of the always good Toni Collete, besides, it gets to be painful and tiring to watch it."
" Part 2
",2020-02-19 00:00:00,8,"It is a nice movie and I hope to watch a second part, it could be some or all of them try to suicide again, somehow them meet at a place they go to suicide since they think the same way, and add a new character young also wants to suicide, and they decide to come together to stop him or her
Or one of them checking on them making sure no one trying again,"
" UN-DOWN
",2019-12-17 00:00:00,6,"Actually quite a sweet little movie. Don't kill yourself, somewhere someone cares."
" Underwhelming but not the worst movie
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,6,"What an incredible cast: Pierce Brosnan, Toni Colette, Aaron Paul, Sam Neill, Rosamund Pike, Imogen Poots. Tragically, the great cast can't save this from being a largely forgettable experience.I decided to ignore the reviews and go into this with an open mind. The cast, along with the premise definitely sold it to me. I love a bit of dark comedy. Unfortunately, there was not enough comedy here. It needed more of it. It often seemed to delve into treating suicide as a bit of a joke, without actually being funny.It felt incredibly long for a 90 minute movie. Despite that, there were still some touching scenes, and Pierce Brosnan and Toni Colette definitely did their best with what they had. I enjoyed the cheesy ending, but I had to suspend all disbelief far too much throughout.I wanted to enjoy this, but didn't. I'll probably forget I saw it in a week."
" A half-good movie about something important
",2019-08-04 00:00:00,8,"It's far from perfect but a sweet thought and in the end it pulls through to be just enough.
I'd recommend it for people who enjoy heartfelt and inspiring stories over detailed quality."
" Lovely movie with plenty of heart
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,8,"It was a truly heartwarming movie. The comedy side of it was tasteful and sweet, without LOL moments. Yet you could see that even in their most desperate times, the characters could see humor in their circumstances.Very well acted by all 4 stars. I have never really thought much of Pierce Brosnan, but this movie showed that there is so much more to him than 007. Toni Collette is amazing in everything she is in and I'm dying to see some other work of the two younger stars that I'm not yet very familiar with, but who were also amazing.If you are looking for a movie that can make you cry and smile at the same thime, this is it."
" I love it
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,9,"There is a dark side inside many who don't value their living.. It was nice putting together different reasons in the four members gang and push it away from the cliff from those whom might have felt the same... I don't see any better message of the movie industry than what you just did...great writer, script, stars and director... I would love it as long I'm still alive"
" A Worth While Movie About Suicide
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,8,"1 May 2016. It's not often a film can take the subject matter of suicide and present it in a entertaining but serious way. The biggest weakness that threatened the essence of the movie was its transition in tone from lightly comic to a more sobering and dramatic experience of individual fears and depressive loneliness and failures. Yet by the end of the movie, the captivating, wry humor at the beginning allows the audience to be drawn later into a more meaningful, serious look at the haunting backgrounds of the main characters. The movie also offers hope to its audience, but not in the completely typical syrupy sweet American ending.The incorporation of comedy and drama into A Long Way Down oddly create an sort of unintended background tension that classic movies have attempted to intertwine together such as Terry Gilliam's The Fisher King (1991), At the same time, there is a more balanced and fresh and diverse flavoring to this movie than the more hard-hitting mainstream movie Girl, Interrupted (1999) about Angelina Jolie's rebellious character committed to an institution or the movie playful, general audience favorite of Sandra Bullock's character being committed to an alcohol rehabilitation center in 28 Days (2000). This movie employs a sense of interactive, interplay and sense of community among its primary characters unlike most movies delving into the psyche like the more dramatic and power introspective look that takes place with Sarah Michelle Geller's performance in Veronika Decides to Die (2009) or the classic alcoholic movie Days of Wine and Roses (1962). In some ways, A Long Way Down resembles George Clooney's comic-melancholy themed ""Up In The Air"" (2009)."
" If you want to get bored Sh**less - then watch it!
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,2,"The soundtrack is rubbish, the plot totally anorexic and the acting? Seen better at the local am dram theatre E15!"
" I DON'T MIND THE PAIN, IT'S THE HOPE THAT KILLS ME
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,8,"On New Years Eve, four people bump into each on top of a popular suicide building with the intent of jumping.Martin Sharp (Pierce Brosnan) was a popular morning show host with a family. He fell from grace because ""she looked like she was 25.""Maureen (Toni Collette) is a rather mousey person who has never lived life. She cares for an invalid son who she deeply loves.Jess (Imogen Poots) is the daughter of a rich politician. Her sister Jennifer, who read on a book on invisibility, ironically went missing two years ago. She is currently mad at her boyfriend who dumped her.JJ (Aaron Paul) Is an American who was part of an amateur band. He claims he has CCR brain cancer.The press has found out about the suicide attempts as they gain their 15 minutes of fame. They in turn form a bond and become their own support group.This is another Magnolia ""feel good"" about yourself film. If you have seen one before, you know the feeling. Typically, the film has light quirky comedy, a few messages about life you can take with you, and decent acting and directing. Rosamund Pike has a role smaller than her billing.Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Brief rear nudity (Poots)"
" Surprisingly Good
",2018-04-23 00:00:00,7,"You'd think and film that is heavily wouldn't be as inspiring or funny, but this film managed to walk the line nicely. The cast is great first of all and the way these characters feel connected right away is really an accomplishment for the writer and director. I came out of this film feeling good and glad that I stumbled upon it."
" Funny, sweet, touching
",2018-02-23 00:00:00,8,"Martin (Pierce Brosnan) was a successful television morning show host UNTIL he slept, inadvertently he claims, with an underage lass. Now, he's jobless, wifeless, kidsless and desperate. So, he climbs a well known London building on New Year's Eve to jump off. But, wait! Its a bit crowded up there! Also thinking of jumping is Maureen (Toni Collette) a single mother with a disabled son, Jess (Imogen Poot) a politician's daughter whose sister has gone missing, and J.J. (Aaron Paul) who says he has brain cancer. As they being chatting, they soon decide tonight is not the night. What they will do instead is make a ""pact"" to try to work out their problems until Valentine's Day. Then, if things are not better, its Geronimo. Jess seems the most troubled and is rushed to the hospital by the new ""gang"" as she has taken an overdose. Also, more secrets come tumbling out. Perhaps the only remedy needed is a friendship that binds them together? This lovely film, based on a book by Nick Hornsby, has humor, sorrow, sweetness, and insight in equal measures. The four principal characters are great and are supporting finely by Sam Neill, Rosamond Pike, and others. The London setting is interesting while a second setting in Tenerife is most lovely. Nice costumes are complimented by a great script and a surefooted direction. Are you ""down"" on life at this moment? Watch this heartwarming movie and then get up and make some new friends!"
" A brilliant novel with a powerful movie adaptation
",2017-11-12 00:00:00,8,"The movie was so well put together and so thoroughly well written it sucked me in from the first scene â€“ I mean how could it not? Four people accidentally interrupting one another from committing suicide is not something that will make me not want to see what the hell is going on with these people.What do these random people have in common, I often asked myself. Nothing. They have absolutely nothing in common and that is what they have in common.They each have a life story and they each have problems to deal with but when they meet on that roof there was an unlike, silent, mutual understanding of each other's predicament. They each were up there because they had nowhere else to be, and somehow they each found themselves with 3 new sort of friends that they were willing, for a small period of time, to postpone their suicidal plans for.Just because. And that was just magnificent.Based on what I think is a brilliant novel and an exceptionally directed movie by Pascal Chaumeil, the movie really brings the characters to life with a great cast.This movie showed me that even if you think you are right there, on the edge, there might actually be someone to pull you back and not give you a reason to live but to momentarily distract you from whatever problem you've got and go search for someone's boyfriend, just because at that moment, that is the major problem she has, even if the real and painful ones are much deeper.In my opinion and having seen too many movies to count, if a movie makes you want to read the book and explore all the details that had to be cut out, then it is a winner.The amazing sightings â€“ I love London and unfortunately I haven't watched as many British movies, based in London, as I would like to â€“ the witty lines delivered from those tragic but altogether funny characters made me fall in love with the story. Fast and hard. And to be honest almost a month later and after having spent a couple of weeks under the sun on the beach reading books, this story â€“ both the movie and the book â€“ is still with me and some lines still make me laugh and some still make me sad. If that is not a successful book adaptation then I don't know what is.I can't recommend it enough and I can't even begin to say how much this book and movie can actually change a person's life."
" If you're a fan of Nick Hornby's novel skip this film.
",2017-05-16 00:00:00,3,I have been a fan of Nick Hornby for nearly 2 decades. A Long Way Down is one of his best novels. This film is only about a quarter of the book.The performances were good but even these talented actors couldn't save this terrible script. I really was anticipating this film but was very disappointed.
" Suicide Club
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,7,"Four strangers who meet while trying to jump off the same tall building on New Year's Eve make a pact to postpone their deaths until Valentine's Day in this often quirky and highly unusual comedy based on a Nick Hornby novel. As per Hornby norm, the dialogue and narration often sparkles with wit and the characters are nicely human and down-to-earth. The bond that develops between them is endlessly fascinating too as they become a bit of a family unit, drawn to one another based on their shared experience. Things only get more interesting as their pact is leaked to the public, causing a media frenzy, and unwarranted hype when (as a practical joke) they decide to claim that an angel in the form of Matt Damon ('Dogma', anyone?) prevented them jumping. The idea of the pact spiraling out of control is, however, never properly developed with the characters subsequently hiding from the press and further things going on. It is also debatable whether the film truly explores the depression and suicidal inclinations felt by its characters who never seemed tempted to end it all ever again merely as a result of their pact. This remains, however, an entertaining film through and through, if a little sappy towards the end and never quite the black comedy that it could have been (think the 1978 Burt Reynolds film 'The End'). The initial scenes of the characters meeting and trying to talk one another out of it are certainly highly memorable and there is an equally unforgettable scene in which they convince a waiter that they are lovers when mistaken for a family!"
