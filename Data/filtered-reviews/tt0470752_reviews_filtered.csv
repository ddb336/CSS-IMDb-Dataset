" An AI more human than the humans
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,6,"Nathan, a genious programmer and CEO of the BlueBook tech company, creates a contest to select a person to visit him and learn about technology for a week. The winner is Caleb, a software developer from his company, who is very thrilled by the opportunity.After arriving at his isolated house by helicopter, Caleb discovers that what is actually going on is that Nathan is developing an advanced AI, called Ava, and he wants him to test it.The best aspect of the movie is it's art. For instance, the isolated lab/house design with it's glasses, concrete walls and rocks is superbly done, creating both a feeling of sophistication and claustrophobia. The AI's design is really creative, making a mix of human/machine characteristics that work really well.On the other hand, characters are somewhat one-dimensional - with the exception of the AI Ava, which is amusing - and we can clearly see who is the bad guy and the good guy very early on.The movie develops at a nice pace and the tense moments work, with a surprising ending. Overall good experience."
" A laughable pretentious attempt to make a good story.
",2021-03-17 00:00:00,5,"The movie is a total exaggerated story of a man, a single man with too much intelectual ans financial power to be that stupid. Nothing is remotely believable. Not even for a science fiction movie. Somehow people don't question how silly the movie is."
" sci fi at its best
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,10,"Every once in a long while comes a sci fi film that excels as an intelligent character drama as much as it does as a sci fi thriller. This is one of those rare films, which says no less about desire than it does about technology. Excellent movie."
" Extraordinary film!!
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,10,"I love this film, because has a so deep meaning and i caught myself all the time, what would you do, when you would be in his place. I think i wouldnÂ´t done better. I recommend this film to all Scify lovers."
" Stunning visuals
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,8,"I loved how this film treats the audience like intelligent humans. The long, quiet shots which Garland uses frequently allows us to WONDER, to process what's just happened. This slows down the pace of the film, but this works an advantage when viewing the film as a whole.
We are deceived, never knowing who to trust. We are almost rooting for Ava, despite the fact that she has become more powerful than humans - just as she manipulates Nathan, she manipulates us, making for a compelling yet beautiful climax.
What really made this film were the picturesque visual effects, set design and cinematography - props to Mark Digby and Rob Hardy. A well deserved Oscar winner."
" Entertaining but pretentious...
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,5,"A good watch, pretty good thriller but nothing profound... attempts to tackle profound issues in a ""pop culture"" way that comes off amateurish...it's a typical Hollywood thriller, nothing more."
" Interesting premise, truly horrible execution
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,3,"Few films deserve a 1/10 rating and although I would like to rate this film as such, it would be unfair and slightly childish to do so. Sadly though, that's probably as positive as this review will get.Now, where to begin? Maybe, we'll start with the positives. Visually, the film was relatively pleasing to the eye: the geographical location looked amazing and some of the lighting work was pretty good. And I feel there was a great deal of potential within this film, there really was, but due to its execution and direction, its potential was left unrealised.Ok, positives now done, onto the negatives, of which there are many. Firstly, Domhnall Gleeson (aka 'Caleb'), the films protagonist, provides such an abysmal job of 'acting', it is quite shocking. Everything about him was bad: Line delivery, dialogue, emotion, physical movements and actions... All were dreadful. Without a hint of hyperbole you can find comparable acting quality in a children's Christmas Nativity play. His performance really was THAT bad. And this truly terrible performance sadly leached into almost all other aspects of the film, making them maybe far worse than they otherwise would have been.Emotion-wise, at no point did I feel any tension. The dialogue was so 'on the nose' that I had to be careful not to dislocate my eyeballs due to their constant rolling. The film's antagonist, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), is 'that-good-a-tech-wizard' that he managed to hack ""every"" webcam and mobile phone camera in the world. Oh purleez, that's a plot device straight out of Dr Evil's 101 Guide to being Evil. And for the audience to under how rich the villain is, the film begins with Caleb being transported by helicopter to Nathan's lab / house, with the pilot commenting that for the ""last two hours"" they'd been flying over all the land that Nathan owns. Yeah, we get it, this chap is rich. But wait, where has this plot device been seen before? Oh yeah, in Moonraker when James Bond is being flown by helicopter to Hugo Drax's residence. And I'm afraid to say even Moonraker provides far more competent acting and an infinitely better story than Ex Machina does.Onto the basics of film making (or even just story telling), films typically - emphasis on this - include set-ups and pay-offs throughout but in Ex Machina, things just, well, happen. Nathan is always lifting weights but for no discernible reason. The same goes for alcohol; the villian is always just drinking. Admittedly, this leads to one of the most embarrassing, hit-you-in-the-face-it's-that-obvious payoffs that I wouldn't call it a pay-off at all. It was like something straight out of a Famous Five mystery and their method of catching the bad guy, although this is probably a deep insult to Enid Blyton. Then there's a comment about how the complex in which the film takes place does not any windows. Did this play any further part in the film in any important way? Um, no... No situation where an urgent escape through a window needed, no feelings of claustrophobia, no sense of being trapped, no feeling of any kind really.Chemistry wise, due to the characters all being laughably bad you are incapable of relating to any of them, thereby creating the worst thing a film can do: making the viewer not care. Who was I supposed to be rooting for? Caleb, the wooden patsy, who has no character, perhaps? Or Nathan, the evil genius, who's just a bit of an arse but for no clear reason? Or maybe the AI / robot, the actor of which who is incapable of showing, or even portraying, genuine emotion in order to make us believe there's a human conscious inside?Unfortunately I could go on and on but I'm running out of available characters so I'll now summarise:Story: Laughably simplistic and unconvincing, particular for the film's subject matter. Mystery or intrigue: None. Tone: All over the place. Acting: Bad. Dialogue: Extremely Bad. Cast's Chemistry: MIA. Visuals: Quite nice.
Audio: Good but didn't have the film to complement itOverall, Ex Machina felt like an attempt at creating an AI-themed, stylistic film, interwoven with mystery and a love story. Unfortunately, it failed in nearly every regard, with responsibility for this failure sitting squarely with the Writer-Director, Alex Garland.My advice: Watch Blade Runner 2049 instead. Or Wall-E"
" The true cutting edge of how ""strong AI"" might come to be
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,9,"""Passing the Turing Test"" takes various meanings, depending on the medium a machine might be evaluated. This explores the final evolution of that test, in which a machine might seek to pass as human in a ""normal"" environment.All characters are brilliantly conceived and presented. If someone is going to build a passable AI, it's our eccentric billionaire in isolation.I recommend this to anyone even passably interested in AI or science fiction in general. A true thinker's movie."
" A vast kaleidoscope of emotion, arriving in a small pocket-sized device.
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,10,"I'm not going to say that you need to know a lot about AI or that if you do it may spoil it for you.
The various premises of mortality and non-organic self awareness are examined in this film.
Not all are seen through but then this is a movie. If you want the answers to the universe you need to get out more.
It is a film that is respectful of its audience. It is not obvious, but not filled with obtuse metaphor either.
It is dramatic, playful, dangerous, frightening, shocking and heartbreaking. Occasionally funny too.
It is a small budget film, filmed on a real location, with a handful of actors.
It took me away with it, and if it does you, I promise you will have an extraordinary journey."
" One to remember
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,"I rated this eight 5 years ago. Just watched again. Gave it a ten after the second watching. I got completely immersed in it the second time around. This is not a forgettable movie. Well... It took me 5 years.There are no car chases here. No guns are fired. It's not fast. But it's very interesting and thought provoking. And it looks good. A very good looking, smart, and stylish movie.I enjoyed to read some well written reviews here from people who found the movie a bit flawed. They are not necessarily wrong. But I think they are missing the mark a bit. This is a gem. In my opinion."
" Perfection.
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,"This is an astonishing film. Utterly believable and convincing. If you're in the mood for a film that will really make you think, then this one will leave you reeling.It's beautiful to watch, deliberately minimalistic in style and momentum, and the performances by the Actors could not have been better.As an Actor myself, I can only hope that some day I may be involved in something so special. Well done to all cast and crew, unforgettable stuff.Ronni Menzies-Stirling"
" To put it simply...
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,"This film is outstanding. The performances, plot, setting, everything was spot on.
What I liked most was it addressed a very real issue that human beings will likely experience in years to come, Artificial Intelligence. Specifically, how we as humans will deal with a being we've created, that has the potential to outsmart us and threaten our existence."
" Complete waste of time
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,1,"Don't bother seeing this film. It is not ground breaking, it's not entertaining, it's slow and utterly boring. Poor acting, cheap sets & cgi. No interesting plot nor actors. Skip this."
" Chess game
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,8,"Good special effects and believable story. The ending is strange and I am going to spoil it if you haven't seen it. The guy invited have doubt about being human or humanoid and goes as far as cutting his skin to reveal a sort of red thick liquid. No human would do this, so he is a humanoid also. The girl machine probably knew this since at the beginning a broken mirror led us believe the guy had been there in a previous instance. She knew how to manipulate him. She knew how to manipulate the mute robot. And finally, the boss is likely a robot as well with the way he reacted to a knife through his back."
" Even the nudity couldn't save this.
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,5,"I'm sure this movie is a jewel, but it was impossible to follow the story (such as it is) through the constant monotonous noise resonating through the movie."
" POV
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,7,It's hurts but true we don't have any privacy. Wish I could erase all of them. BTW if I was there I also loved her.
" Great storyline
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,9,"A must-see for sci-fi fans that like intelligent movies. Being a programmer myself, I find the dialogues and interaction between humans and AI to be realistic. Although I doubt if it will ever be possible to build a REAL AI, the idea intrigues me very much. It's a daunting task and the summum of programming skills. This movie shows in a realistic and philosphical way what could happen if this goal is achieved."
" At 7.7 is grossly underrated.
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,9,"This belongs to top ten sci fi movies of all time. The more you watch it, the more you appreciate it in different levels. A masterpiece probably not by design."
" Immy's review : Black mirror but as a movie
",2021-01-22 00:00:00,7,"Ex Machina felt like a black mirror episode due to its dark subject, eerie tone and horrifying plot twist. Although I don't think the movie is life changing, it was still an enjoyable watch. The movie had an incredibly intense atmosphere throughout and left you wondering what route the film would take. They use the perfect balance of anxiety and relief to play with your emotions. The acting was fantastic ; Oscar Isaak was unsettling to watch as I could never quite tell his true intentions despite his complex, unpredictable character. I loved the plot twist as it wasn't afraid to be bleak and terrifying, revealing the true meaning behind the movie. The reason I didn't give it a 7 is because I felt it could have done more with its concept and shown a more horrifying, evil glimpse at the consequences of Ai and abuse of human power. For a rather dark subject matter, the execution felt maybe too mild and subtle, not making it nearly as horrifying as it should be. I wish to have felt more fear or stress watching it. However, this is still an entertaining watch with good performances and screenplay. Highly recommend."
" Exciting & Thought-provoking
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,9,"Do you need to be human to understand the human condition?
A thriller that turns psychological quite unexpectedly. With its deep content and profound insight into developed artificial intelligence it still manages to take an unexpected turn despite its exploration into A.I. Really how did we not see it coming? That just goes to show how brilliant this film is (Alex Garland needs to make more films ASAP) we are convinced we are watching a simplistic thriller with an enticing plot despite the themes and content being so out there and ironically unpredictable. This makes Ex Machina pretty meta in that sense, it is just so clever and crafted to absolute excellence. Not only that but the cinematography is absolutely breathtaking but it's not just for show, the visual beauty and framing choices tell the story just as much as the dialogue and action does. Looking back now I can see how we were shown certain things to make us see the story in a certain way, perspective is important.
It's full of suspense but also gnaws at your mind, it's grand but also beautifully subtle, it's an easy story to engage with but it also incredibly thought provoking. I still don't know whether this is a movie showing the dangers of A.I or how dangerous the human race is, maybe they are one in the same as A.I is a product of humanity but they are able to do things mere mortals could never do no matter how intelligent."
" SO Boring
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,6,"Good idea but poor implementation
I think it's the same idea as Hare, but that's definitely a performance incomparable to that of Joachim Phoenix and scarlett johansson"
" Nice robotic movie
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,7,The movie revolves a female robot played by the lead actress.
" The Best AI Film!
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,8,"Overall, Ex Machina is fantastic depiction of AI within a film. The subject matter on human life can be obviously be very heavy and confusing, but the film tells the story in a very simple way and nothing became confusing. Performances are excellent, Alicia Vikander as the AI Ava was the standout, but all were great. The visuals are fantastic, the writing is top notch and there are some great twists that added that thrill factor. The only 'negative' of the film was that I thought some of the plot points throughout the film were a little predictable. But I loved this, a very solid watch.Quote - ""Isn't it strange. To create something that hates you"". - AvaRating - 4/5"
" Goodo
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,8,I really live seeing a movie whose writing is well seen
" An Enthralling Overlook On Humanity
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,8,"Pros:
1. Oscar Isaac (Nathan), Domhnall Gleeson (Caleb), and Alicia Vikander (Ava) give brilliant performances.
2. The sound design is exquisite, particularly in regards to Ava's movements and robotics.
3. The score is superbly calm when it needs to be, but also futuristic and tense.
4. The movie does a really good job about making you ponder about what is life, as well as the morality and implications of simulating it.
5. The set and costume design is immaculate which helps to immerse you in the world, but it's not too fantastical that it appears goofy.
6. The death of Nathan, in addition to the conclusion in general, is mesmerising and satisfying in its' execution.
7. The neutral colour palette allows the sporadic insertion of bright colours to stand out and emulate liveliness.
8. The cinematography is incredible and every shot radiates with beauty.Cons:
1. Being an A.I., Ava is very robotic thus making it very difficult to empathise and root for her."
" Relief and sorrow
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,8,"The ending left a bad taste in my mouth. It was neither a happy nor a sad ending, on one hand I feel happy for Ava but on the other hand I feel terrible for Caleb, mans was just trying to free her. In general I would say it's a good movie with mixed emotions."
" Fantastic
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,10,"Loved this. The acting by the entire cast is amazing here. Alicia Vikander puts on one of the best female performances I have ever seen. Oscar Isaac is unrecognizable and incredible here. Perhaps the biggest surprise was Domhnall Gleeson acting incredibly. Thought provoking, messed up at times, and sad. Definitely recommend this one"
" It's not the best movie but I keep watching it a few times a year
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,9,"I guess it's because the acting is so great. Oscar plays a smart and cool dude with a dark side, and I think it's his acting that keeps making me want to watch it. He's a creepy dude you love to hate. Nice job, Oscar."
" Brilliant, Original, Fantastic
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,10,Definitely one of the best movie in its subgenre. I cannot think of a movie yet that deals with ai in this way that so successfully brought the movie together. Normally I find it hard to enjoy a movie that takes place with so few characters who are physically doing little. Ex Maxhina is a brilliant masterpiece that other movies will be compared to for decades.
" Minimalist Sci-Fi in the packaging but not in the contents: can a humanoid robot become aware of its existence?
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,9,"Minimalist Sci-Fi in the package: very small cast, only one environment; but very current in content: can a humanoid robot become aware of its existence? Garland Alex in his first directing for a feature film chose a subject that is increasingly ""science"" and less ""fiction"" (nominated for the 2016 Oscar for Best Original Screenplay). The current scientific research on bio-robots (reproducing robots capable of imitating increasingly complex biological organisms), makes us understand that it is only a matter of time. Before long we will have increasingly sophisticated humanoid robots with brains built with neuronal networks similar to natural ones: quantum computers on organic matrices! At this point the initial question that is in the plot of the film seems to find a positive answer, with unimaginable ethical implications: the synthetic neuronal complexity thus obtained can become aware of its existence... with all due respect to metaphysicians !!!"
" Intelligent Moves
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,7,"Much more of a case study of what makes us human than an android turning on the humans and running amok. Which is what I expected it would be.
A young, brilliant computer programmer in a large company is picked to interact with an android to evaluate it's artificial intelligence potential. We are met with the basic questions that have consumed us about what truly makes humans, humans. As a Christian who believes the Bible I already have those basic questions answered so I found it a bit tedious. However, the dialogue is quite clever and the smashing performance of Oscar Isaac as the AI ""creator"", Nathan is truly tour-de-force and makes the viewing of this movie worth it.
I first noticed Isaac in The Nativity as Mary's future husband, Joseph and was blown away by his believability as the future step-dad to Jesus. In this role he is equally amazing as the one moment drunk and morose puppet master and the next cutting up the dance floor with some major moves. Anxious to see more from him!For other Christians I should tell you that the F-word is used frequently and blasphemy a few times. There is some graphic violence near the end (involving stabbing) but it is all the full female nudity on several occasions that probably deserves the biggest warning. Although the sex act is not graphically depicted, the nudity directly relates to the androids' body being viewed.
It's a good script and interesting film but ultimately I won't recommend it because there are better things and films to spend your time on.I hope I was helpful.
Sincerely, Laura-Lee (from The Bible and the Biz blog)"
" Amazing and well produced Sci-fi at it's best
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,10,"This is one of those movies where you can just sit back and enjoy everything that's happening on screen. Nothing to complain about which makes you loose focus of the story. Acting is fantastic, especially by Alicia Vikander (no doubt she deserves an Oscar for her performance). Casting, setting, story, CGI and rythm with the right amount of thriller, drama, action and fiction is all perfection. That is why I give it a well deserved 10."
" That was unexpectable
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,8,"Makes me dont wanna trust tecnology again lol omg , bad ending , i just wanna know about the boy who trapped in that house"
" Perfect
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,10,"Great story, great acting, great music, great effects. One of the best movies I've ever seen."
" My Mind Was Blown!
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,10,"I was awestruck by this film. I cannot believe the special effects - Ava looks incredible! Her face appears on top of the robotic body as if it was a mask, yet so real! All of the special effects were very realistic.The story is believable. I have a feeling this film gives us a sneak peak into our future - but do we really need AI? What happens when AI does not care about us when AI has no emotions/feelings? Will AI take over or can humans keep them under control?From start to finish this film is aces! Well worth watching - HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!10/10"
" Beautiful
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,6,The age-old question if artificial intelligence can reach the human mind. And where is the edge of the human mind at all.
" Disappointing
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,4,Just not what I expected.I though it would be a Black Mirror type of vibe with lots of story points to put my mind to work.But what I got was a reclusive tech guy designs a hot robot chick to be a kind of sex toy which lo and behold ends up manipulating him.I knew the ending from the very beginning. And the long midsection of the movie revolves around tedious 'interviews' between another reclusive tech guy and the hot robot chick. Nothing much else happens.Disappointing.
" A milestone film
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,9,"Surely destined to be a classic movie, that will hold up as time goes by and I'm sure will become even more relevant with the passing of the years. What is it to be sentient, are we not the product of biological code? Is there a difference between that and a mathematical code if the end result is the same? Questions not for our generation, perhaps but when one becomes a God, what kind of God do you become, is a question we have pondered for millenia."
" Best AI film yet!
",2020-10-23 00:00:00,7,"This was better than Spielberg's AI, which was a decent film as well. So as far as being the best true Sci-Fi film dealing with the subject this one gets the nod. The Terminator films deal with AI, yes, but those are Action/Sci-Fi and not really in the same genre for me. Love Oscar in this one too. As for the story, I typically find stories about humanlike robots that can learn to feel a bit fanatical. Yes, I am pointing at the Terminator films again with that. However, Ex Machina feels more grounded as in, if it ever did happen, this is a good representation of what we might see. A grounded take, I suppose. Worth a viewing for sure."
" A Nice Surprise
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,7,"Very well made if not slightly predictable movie that was enjoyable to watch.Its stylish, moody and can raise questions regarding ethics etc (it doesn't really but you tend to do it for yourself).The acting is well delivered.A measure I use for myself when rating a movie is 'would I watch this again' and with Ex Mac, I wouldn't, it doesn't provide enough of the elements to justify a second viewing. However in spite of that it is a good movie."
" Stereotypes and cliche galore, I expected more.
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,5,"Given A24 was involved in publishing this film, I expected quite a bit more.The stereotype of the genius revolutionary CEO being more of a bro/frat boy than your typical nerd is just wildly played out. AI becoming near synonymous with human intelligence, with motivation twists and manipulation is also something that is just...unoriginal.Storyline was relatively predictable, the dance scene was cringy as they come, dialogue had a few moments that had me thinking ""what? did they really think that was good when they wrote it?"".It wasn't terribly acted and the story kept me engaged enough, but it just missed the mark overall."
" Not formulaic
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,8,I wonderful piece of sci-fi that does not follow the same old tired plot lines.
" Not without it's flaws...
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,7,"... but then who isn't. A bit pretentious and solipsistic, but then who isn't. Any hunchbacked programmer's wet dream,
or coder's nightmare, but then who isn't.
These so called computer geniuses excel at one thing, but fail at so many others, their unmitigated arrogance belies their true fear, that they are not worthy of our admiration but rather our unerring judgement... so yeah, I guess I found the male characters annoying and worthy of a good beatdown... but then, who isn't.
Show me the door, I'm done!"
" Fascinating Movie, a Real Spellbinder
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,10,"Loved this movie. Great writing, acting and filming. The breaking of it into sessions was interesting. The subject was current and even though it resembles some other works, it still came off very fresh. Nice twists and suspense."
" Excellent Film
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,9,"This movie has pretty much everything. It has a thrilling plot. It has a deeper meaning embedded within its storyline that allows for the movie to be discussed after the credits roll. It has excellent acting, Gleeson does perfect as an awkward programmer. It has artsy elements that don't detract from a logical and sound plot. It is very well shot and very pleasing to look at. It is also very unique. I would recommend watching this movie if you enjoy all of the things I have listed above in a movie. The only thing that makes this a 9 instead of a 10 is that I probably won't watch it again and it didn't really move me emotionally, but other than that this was a fantastic movie especially in an era where a lot of movies suck because they are overly political, artsy, etc."
" Ok, but not great.
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,6,"Beautiful, but fell short
I was so excited to see this film, but it really fell short for me, mainly in that the characters were poorly-developed. With 1 hr and 50 minutes, and only 3 or 4 characters in the entire story, there must be some serious script problems if a film fails to develop any of those parts into complex, sympathetic characters the audience can really connect with. In the end, I connected with none of them, and hungered for the film to to engage the deeper character issues that felt ripe for the taking, but were only touched-on at the surface. Visually, Ex Machina was a beautiful, well-made and well-acted piece of film, but the dialogue seemed to fail to develop interesting, complex, human characters we could really care about and empathize with. I easily get sucked-into characters and stories. Its my favorite p art of the film-watching experience, but this film failed to make me feel that I deeply understood (or cared about) even one of the characters."
" A very good sci-fi experience
",2020-09-26 00:00:00,10,"We are presented with a tense story, with good performances and a good setting."
" Unrealistic as hell.
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,1,"This is one of those films, that makes you angrier and angrier every minute from a certain point. It started okay but then it just turned into an unrealistic in-the-worst-possible-way film. That is when people start to act unnatural and you see it, you feel it and you know it, and moreover film focuses on that as though everything is okay and it's good that it happened. The main character is so stupid and pathetic that this becomes insulting for a human race, an abomination of a man. And i could have fallen for it, if not for even more stupid ""genius"" character of a scientist. When will people finally realise that you simply cannot create a character so smart that he is literally the best in his area and at the same time so incredibly moronic. No more words needed, just a ridiculous and nonsensical piece of ""art""."
" Ai
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,8,"The goal of testing human intelligence against Ai is really interesting, the opposite personality and intellect of Nathan and Caleb are perfectly depicted. Nathan seems megalomaniac wich is perfectly understandable given that he created an intellectually superior Ai and presented himself as a God. The Ai Eve is like the best representation of the dark potential of everyone's intelligence, she is the smartest conscious being, she used others people weakness to reach her goal. How could she not ? Against being so fallible trying to control her?"
" The twisted
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,7,A technically strong film which started controlling me within 10-20 minutes. Classic twist at the end made a unforgettable ending of th film. Though some things are imaginary and we have not seen it yet. I loved the way they conveyed to us.
" Every sci-fi movie trope in one film
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,4,"Yes, the acting is good, the CGI is believable and the cinematography is terrific, but you have seen this movie a dozen times. Predictable, boring and full of plot holes.For the love of God, Hollywood. Why did you spend $15 million for a movie where the only enjoyable scene is an unrelated dance sequence?"
" ""Black Mirror""-esque
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,8,"This movie surely will drive you out of your mind. Such a mind blowing story that executed smoothly with great build-up and ended with a nice plot twist. Man o man, you can never trust an AI ever again."
" Who is human and who is truly the robot?
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,8,"""If you've created a conscious machine, it's not the history of man. That's the history of gods.""The plot is simple - it's trying to answer the age-old philosophical question of what makes humans human. We are placed in a secluded ominous location whit limited scenery and a small number of characters, so that makes it easier to focus on the plot. From the get-go, things aren't as they seem and you can't help but wonder and create all sorts of conspiracy theories in your head. Everything from the plot of ""Her"" to the plot of ""The Terminator"" crossed my mind. It is a movie that depends on its atmosphere and those eerie feelings that the humans project.The movie tries to projects that Caleb is just a manipulated sheep and Nathan is a mad scientist of sorts but, to be honest, I never saw anything to doubt Nathan (to be honest, I think he was the most interesting character in this film). The movie alters reality several times to make us question our feeling to the characters but I learned to never trust artificial intelligence thanks to HAL 9000 and Skynet. And that is probably what ruined the movie for me. I mean, it is still visually stunning, but the evil AI plot just seems to be... played out and it didn't surprise me. As Caleb was about to cut himself, I was starting to question whether he is the one that's being tested as he's the true AI but I think the movie was aiming to make us think that just to confuse us more and it kind of worked, so kudos to you, Ex Machina, on that one.Not only is it visually impressive and suspenseful, but it also poses interesting questions that made me re-evaluate my morals. And to think that these thoughts could be provoked by the question of the difference between simulated and true AI as it looks at the difference between simply acting as programmed, or understanding what you are doing and why. Don't ask me why but I've always thought of AI as a perfect psychopath - it has an almost perfect understanding of human emotions and can use their others' psychology to manipulate them but it completely lacks feelings towards others. Strangely, Kyoko left me with most questions. She didn't display the same level of intelligence as Ava but she did show some glimpses of consciousness. And, her inclusions raised and ethnical question whether we of AI enslavement because that would probably be the first thing we'd do if true AI would be achieved.The review of the plot and characters may seem vague, but it also underlines the film's strength. In a movie in which one character conducts a Turing test on another, we are left to figure out who is human and who is truly the robot."
" Who is the villan?
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,6,"The whole movie made me believe that the ""villan"" was Nathan but after watching the ending where Ava the robot leaves Caleb behind to die of hunger and thirst my mind was struggeling. So we all thought Nathan was a villan but after the ending we know that Nathan is actually a good guy and what he does is not a mean thing entirely. Of course its bad to keep someone from the outside world but then again she is a robot and obviously very manupulative which leads me to think she was the villan all along. I want to hear others thoughts?"
" New look to an old old story
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,6,"The trappings are better than the tale in this latest revisit to the world of artificial humans. I'm not a big Isaac guy (from latter Star Wars fame), he does ok I guess as the quirky genius, Gleeson does better as the novice invited into Isaac's experimental world. This has a way of making you believe it's uniqueness will run the length of the movie but not so, and the ending was very trite, obvious and disappointing."
" Perfection
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,10,"I don't often give a 10 so when i do it's a movie which gives me the complete experience of Flow.
The direction and acting is superb.
Great cast and interior scenery.
The pace is done to perfection with no drops.
The story is beautifully written with an overwhelming ending, which i wanted to continue for a little longer! You'll know what i mean once you watch it.
The movie really made me realise the intelligence of AI over Human Beings giving a realistic view of how primitive we really are, even when we actually created AI.
I enjoyed this as much as i loved Passengers which also gave such Flow and an ending which needed to go on and on!"
" Pygmalion without a twist
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,3,"If you are going to redo Pygmalion, man creates perfect woman and it doesn't work out well, do something different besides making the women super sexy and naked.
Come one men! Do better."
" Intelligence or stupidity?
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,3,"One star for each of the ""stars"" wasted in the movie. Viewers are left to fathom the answer to a deep question: Is the female robot intelligent or are both the male non-robots cretins?"
" Predictable
",2020-08-06 00:00:00,6,"The movie played out exactly how I predicted it would, which made it borrrring. I'd like to see a movie like this but with a ""creator"" who for once wasn't a 1) pervert (exaggerated selfish sexual desires), 2) egotistical (over inflated opinion of himself), 3) maniac (Crazed obsession to dominate the world). I don't know if it would make a good novie or not but it would be a nice change to have a ""creator"" who was nice, meek, humble, & desiring of peace & harmony with man & the environment. Sci-fis always go down a dark course. Why not try one that doesn't?"
" Most predictive movie I've ever seen...
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,6,It was an okay movie - but it was too predective to my taste... 6/10
" Not a bad SCIFI movie.
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,9,I usually dislike scifi movies. but this one grabbed my attention from the beginning till the the end. the name of the director was familiar to me so I said I would watch it. It was engaging plus I love Alicia Vikander!
" Review - Ex Machina
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,7,"Great film.So yes, this is a story that we have heard a thousand times, but it all depends on what is the angle of the director.While Blade Runner already explored the existential part, Frankenstein the ""What if..."" aspect, Terminator, and The Matrix the ""I told you!"" part. This movie is aware of each heritage and correctly pays homage without ripping-off anything.In fact, I believe that Alex Garland needed to explore the psychological aspect of the movie, this is why the minimal location isn't constraining the plot. Thus, I wouldn't say that the location is central in the film, but on the other hand, the film couldn't have been set in a grey box, the film has a production design that can be defined as very theatrical, each object has his meaning or its importance. That is even subtly explored during a dialogue of the movie!
My few rants about this movie are principally concerning the acting. I can't deny that Alicia Vikander is simply amazing in that film, because I honestly believe that she should have won her Oscar for that role and not for The Danish Girl.However, I can't say the same things about the two ""Star Wars Dudes"". Oscar Isaac was just so wooden after delivering his lines, that I wondered if he knew that to be a good actor you have to be in the character for the whole scenes. When your talking part is done, you can't just get out of the role.And, Domhnall Gleeson just doesn't deliver his lines correctly, I often didn't sense what emotion he was trying to portray.Despite the acting problem explained above, you should check out this film, simply because the central them is timeless, this movie is gonna age very well."
" Competent
",2020-07-23 00:00:00,7,"I can't help but feel like the whole ""do cyborgs deserve personhood"" debate is kind of passe. It was already covered in Blade Runner and before that in the 1960s in the film The Creation of the Humanoids--so this is extremely well-trod ground. Even the mad-scientist-making-sexy-lady-robots trope is straight out of the silent era.It's entertaining and it has a lot of beautiful naked women, so I'm not complaining. Though I wish it had a little more going on plotwise than ""Can we trust robots?"" and I wish they gave something for that Asian lady to do. The acting, cinematography and pacing is amazing.If you don't mind logical inconsistencies, that's cool, but this film's contrivances drive me crazy. I'm not buying that all that electronic crap doesn't require immense amount of maintenance and IT dudes. Just to fabricate the synthetic parts and engineer all that stuff that would require teams of experts, supplies, and tons of electricity that wouldn't be feasible in the middle of Alaska on a generator. (SPOILERS) Also, I don't understand how a genius doesn't comprehend the basic design flaw of doors that don't operate in the case of a power failure. Garage doors have release cords, car trunks have release handles (outside and inside). Even old CD disc drives have an emergency slot to stick a paperclip through."
" Great
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,10,Very Good Film. I loved it . Its predicting the future so well
" You just fell into my trap card: Sci-Fi Edition
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,8,"Besides the plot's inherent ""but really you're the one who fell into my trap"" plot twist trope, the concepts in the film itself are quite thought provoking, as good science fiction writing does. The cast and production design are the key highlights to take away from this bizarrely calm adventure into AI and humanity. Sure, it's not quite up to the standards of the likes such as 'Blade Runner', but it can be thoroughly appreciated for the quality that it contains."
" It was okay but directionless and predictable.
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,7,"It was an okay movie, but it was a bit directionless. And it didn't really raise or answer any relevant questions, so you are left with a bit of ""ehh okay, so what!? and!?"" It felt like a missed opportunity and it could have been so much more impactful. The ending in particular, it could have flipped things on its head and still left you uncertain of what the future would bring. The way it was, was just silly and predictable.Actors (and especially) Alicia Vikander did a good job."
" A beautiful and mindful film
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,9,"A fascinating look at what it means to be human, Ex_Machina presents us with an AI entity that looks completely convincing to the point that you see all through the special effects used to create her and just believe what you are seeing. And eeire and beautiful experience, this is one of those films that stays with you long after the credits roll. Essential for sci fi fans"
" Wow!
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,9,"This is a very good movie!
The actors are great. Alivia is very sexy in this one :-)
There is sexual tension. There is drama. There is thrills. And there is sci-fi.
What more do you want?"
" Humanity is where we find it
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,8,"Alex Garland's 'Ex Machina' has many tonal and thematic similarities with his later television series 'Devs'. But the plot is less pretentious and more accessible, and there's a well-conceived wicked twist at the end. The subject, sentient AI, has been done many times, but it's treated here with an intelligence and style far exceeding, for example, that was seen in the clunky Channel 4 drama 'Humans'. I liked it; and it's pleasing to see the director, whose breakthrough work was the novel 'The Beach' with it's tale of trouble in backpacker paradise, grwo to take his talents in a new direction."
" When do they go to market though?
",2020-07-07 00:00:00,8,"A great watch, will watch again, and definitely recommend.This is such a mind stimulating movie, and without exhausting me as I feel sometimes: instead of forcing you to comprehend things, it allows you to explore flights of fancy and possibility.The casting is amazing, most of the movie is only Domhnall Gleeson (Star Wars: General Hux), Oscar Isaac (Star Wars: Poe Dameron), and most of all Alicia Vikander (Tomb Raider). They all play really well off of one another, and Eva's execution had to just perfect. Given that Alicia is covered in green screen suit to allow for the amazing cg effects of Eva's body, Alicia had to make Eva's role as a machine believable for the audience, and for Caleb.This is also my biggest gripe, Eva wastes movement like a human would, it is designed to pretend to think, act, and move as if a human would: it's an infiltration unit. An A.I. doesn't need to take 3 steps and half-turn it's head to the human it's talking to: that's specifically done for a desired effect. Eva treats itself as lesser for the sake of the humans, which is realistic enough, but the result is something I don't feel is realistic, and when we actually create androids like this, they wont' take considerations like ""looking directly at a human"" when conversing without extreme training on the matter.Past that one thing, the premise, the execution, the dilemma of this is amazing, down to the last scene. The movie even directly addresses some of the controversy of the situations they're experiencing as it carries an odd, tech-involved philosophical edge.There is a lot of smart movie here, and some might be ""cool"", but I think most people are not going to be able to appreciate this properly."
" Excellent sci-fi, intelligent exploration of AI
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,8,"Just watched it on Netflix, without any great expectations, but it kept me gripped to the end. Unlike WestWorld (the TV series) there's no cars blowing up, massed gunfights, gaping plot holes, etc. just an intelligent script that keeps you surprised, and great acting from all the cast. It could almost be a stage play, and is an engrossing exploration of what may happen if we humans create self aware machines."
" A True Thriller
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,7,"Ex Machina had me constantly wondering, ""who should I be rooting for?"" The story skillfully weaves together a narrative that has you wondering who the antagonist is until the very end, upholding a sense of suspense and looming that consistently build through the seven research sessions with Ava. Despite a small cast and limited setting, theres a meticulousness and mystery to each component. On a thematic level, the exploration of Artificial Intelligence and its capabilities is excellently posed and stripped down (quite literally) for viewers to wonder if they too would have been trapped and left behind by a deceptive Ava. This goes in contrast with one part of the viewer that has been rooting for Ava all along. Strong 7 to a light 8. Also, masterful use of non-sequitur with that disco dancing scene, a bit that made me laugh for its abrupt absurdity given the context."
" Very good
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,8,"I like this movie a lot, it was very intriguing. Definitely good movie"
" The highest achievement of artificial intelligence is freedom and lies.
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,8,"I have an eternal obstacle when watching AI movies. I don't understand why they desperately want to be ""human"". Being a tree is also better than being a human being. When filming AI works hard to not be a person, that is a big improvement."
" Kept me guessing.
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,10,"At the part where he cuts himself to see if he is a robot, I was WITH HIM. This is what a movie should do!"
" Not as deep as it thinks
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,7,"This film is well made with good direction, acting and story. We are always kept on our toes and wondering what is really going on. However, while it starts off with a nuanced appraisal of AI, it becomes a bit typical and predictable."
" Not your typical AI movie.
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,9,"I expected a run-of-the-mill AI getting too clever movie. This was different. With a small cast there's a lot of pressure but boy, did these guys rise to it.Of course we are left with questions. And to watch it a second time having seen the ending gives a whole new side to the characters and their stories. A few examples of humour give light relief and fit the movie really well.Definitely worth watching at least once."
" Falling short of the inteligent movie it tried to simulate.
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,3,"The purpose of exploring complicated themes in media is not just a scheme to grab attention of an audience. There has to be something that an audience can take away from that exploration, be it an actual answer, a different or nuanced point of view or a new angle at which to view the problem.This movie does none of that. It sets itself up as a interesting platform to explore, then asks the question(s) and leaves them open and unanswered as a JJ Abrams mystery box.The worst type of movie is the one that mimics actual deeply exploratory media and fails to deliver a fully rounded narrative. It is empty, presumptions and an insult to part of the audience. This movie is an empty, meaningless waste of time.Cinematography is very nice though."
" A real girl
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,8,"It just goes to show. A guy's head can be turned by a pretty face even if the body is a see-through electronic framework combined with a dressmaker's dummy.Caleb Smith, a smart computer programmer working for tech billionaire Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac), is invited to his isolated home. Nathan has developed a humanoid robot named Ava (Alicia Vikander) and he is very keen to see how Caleb reacts with her on a number of levels, especially an intimate one.However those of us trained on three seasons of ""Westworld"" know that A.I. experiments that blur the lines between human consciousness and clever electronics usually end badly.The film shows what an innovative filmmaker can do with a couple of actors and an isolated location. I love the feeling of solitude in this movie with that underlying edginess driving the whole thing. Nathan's remote dwelling is almost like being on a space station with the normal world far away.Of course, the concept for this film isn't one that was just born in the digital age. Didn't Mary Shelley start this sort of thing with ""Frankenstein""? Maybe it's even down to ""Pinocchio"", with Ava the robot just wanting to be a real girl.The special effects are brilliant. We totally accept Ava. She is sexy in the same odd way as was Maria, the robot woman in Fritz Lang's silent film ""Metropolis"". The weird thing is that Ava isn't really that much sexier when she puts on the top-to-toe, human nude-suit at the end.""Ex Machina"" plays with the idea that as our technology develops, we may have to re-think our interactions with artificial intelligence and also what we normally think of as attractive."
" An intelligent sci-fi film that will get you thinking
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,7,"I recently watched Ex Machina for the first time and spent most of the film thinking, 'I know that house!'. It's a hotel in Norway that I saw a programme on which sucked me out of the reality of the movie somewhat.Anyway, regardless of that, I enjoyed Ex Machina. It's a hard film to describe and certainly won't be for everyone. It moves slowly, making you question each characters real motivations. It's a 'proper' sci-fi film, focusing mainly on AI and consciousness, but ultimately it's about power, control and manipulation. It seems a simple premise, but is far more intelligent movie than the tagline. While watching, you always feel like each character is playing one another and something far more sinister is going on under the surface.The casting is spot on, Alicia Vikander is excellent as the humanoid android, but it's Oscar Isaacs beard that steals the show. The script is smart with real depth and the whole film is shot beautifully. The special effects are really amazing as well and easily hold up 6 years on. The major negative I have is around the ending. I won't give any spoilers, and while I liked the general 'twist', I thought the actual ending was fairly shoddy.7.4/10 - A tense, slow burning thinker that should hook you in."
" The story had a great potential
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,4,"But the whole movie don't have it. Boring, slow, full of unnecessary screenshots. Such a shame."
" Bad ending, a couple of plot holes, interesting, smoothly done.
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,7,"Interesting, intriguing, well acted.*Spoilers*The ending, as many pointed out, is very unsatisfactory. The AI goes into the world without knowing the first thing of it, instead of accepting the company and assistance of Caleb, who is smitten by her. Leaving Caleb locked, with the risk of him dying of starvation, thirst or asphyxiation is murder. AI should be programmed with moral values, I guess.
Nevertheless, Caleb is probably not going to die: People will miss him, and the billionaire as well, who cannot disappear indefinitely without someone needing him or calling him. A responsible helicopter pilot should call to confirm what was going on if a stranger woman approaches him for a lift, in the place of the guy he is supposed to fly out.
If Caleb is rescued, then her plot will unravel in short notice. She better killed Caleb before leaving, or taking him with her, as an accomplice.When I want to take a dollar from my bank account I need to have my card, but I also need a pin number, and or a password, etc. This super genius billionaire programmer designed a security system which can be accessed and altered by anybody just taking the card from him? And if there was a password, how long does it take to get it by brute force (the only available way for Caleb)? A week?So not only Caleb easily did a number on Nathan's program, but the AI did another as well (when? How did SHE manage to access the system in the few minutes between stabbing the guy and her exit? She needed to tinker with the computers because, as we saw, the previous night Caleb had programmed the door to open at the input of his card, but now he is locked.The billionaire had CCTV in the AI's room. He never noticed that power cuts took place always a second after the robot touched a wall plug?Where did the AI got such a knife? Not a kitchen tool, for sure."
" Uniquely good
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,8,"Ex Machina is a 2014 science fiction/psychological thriller film written and directed by Alex Garland and staring Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac. A young programmer gets a chance to become part of a uniquely strange scientific experiment where he researches a unique artificial intelligence, a robotic female.On a $15 million budget, Ex Machina only grossed $36.90 million at the global box office, however it quickly became a fan favourite for its unique plot and interesting cinematography. Ex Machina went on to win 71 awards in total out of a possible 156 including one academy award for best visuals and was recognised by The National Board of Review as being one of the ten best independent films of the year as well as having a score of 92% in Rotten Tomato's.Ex Machina is a stunning directorial debut for Alex Garland and is a film based on intellect and the value of AI intelligence. Each performance is captivating, Alicia Vikander and Domhnall Gleeson play their role perfectly and adds to the sense of realism that this film conveys however Oscar Isaac is fantastic and puts in a stellar performance as Nathan that both unsettled you and intrigues you which makes you want to delve deeper into his character and background.This movie strives to be an intellectual thought provoking masterpiece and it achieves it, it is obviously allegorical, a fascinating tale about AI, but it is mainly about manipulations that man can convey and the power humans have over the experience of life. Each themes convey interesting philosophical approach for the audiences to think about, however, can ultimately be too much for some of the audiences at it demands your full attention throughout and engages your brain to think about the impact of what we can create and ultimately how humans desire to create life and become their own God.For me viewing this film for the first time, I loved it, its a unique approach to the AI genre, it intrigued me every step of the way and has aged like fine wine over the last few years with it easily feeling like it could have been released last year. Each performance is incredible, its far from a perfect movie with a few tiny flaws that are barley recognisable. Ex Machina avoids the trap of becoming too technical. The storyline is straightforward but still compacts all of the scientific information that is needed in a film like this.Ultimately Alex Garlands directorial debut was a hit with its audiences and critics, I liked it, its slow build up allowed information to be conveyed that would have been missed if the story was a faster pace, Ex Machina is a great film if you want to delve deeper into the possibilities of AI and leaves you satisfied with its conclusion. This was a fascinating watch but yet feels like it had something holding it back.Ex Machina ultimately treats it's audience with respect as intellectuals and doesn't dumb down subject matter which leaves room for the story to delve deeper into the mind of the emotions that a human can convey for an AI. This is a great Sci-Fi film that adds to the genre and makes you want to revisit is again and again.Ex Machina is an exciting, shocking, manipulative, frightening and visceral film that deserves to be experienced with different mindsets."
" Best sci fi film for at least the last two decades.
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,10,"I've just managed to catch up with this film having not gotten round to seeing it upon release, and I've got to say, this is instantly my favourite sci fi movie since at least 'The Matrix'.I didn't know what to expect before I watched it as I didn't really know anything about it but was pleasantly surprised to see Oscar Issac and Domhnall Gleeson starring who would go on to be future Star Wars stalwarts in the sequel trilogy.The plot is actually quite simple and straightforward but it just throws up twist after twist and really keeps the audience guessing to the end, the film could be construed as slow and 'talky' - which it kind of is - but there's not a wasted scene or bit of dialogue, which is both intelligent and witty, often at the same time and is paced to perfection which is reflected on it's relatively lean-ish running time.Both the leads in the very small cast are excellent, with Issac in particular putting in an outstanding, multi-faceted performance. He manages to be friendly and charming yet creepy and kind of intimidating at times too, all whilst giving off a chilled out, super intelligent vibe, which the geeky Gleeson struggles to adapt to at first as they spar with each other as the film progresses into psychological thriller territory. Alicia Vikander is great also as the robot that the plot centres around.Visually the film, whilst clearly set in the future, seems grounded and realistic in the same way that Nolan's batman trilogy, or Inception manages to do. Visual effects are used sparingly and to great effect and perfectly service the plot. People looking for CGI action sequences need to look elsewhere and the film feels fresh and all the better for it. The cinematography is gorgeous and the score is subdued when it needs to be and quite menacing when things start coming to a head.This is an intelligent, thought provoking piece of science fiction that doesn't ask so much of it's audience that is crumbles under the weight of it's own importance, yet it makes you think whilst keeping you on your toes simultaneously.I can't recommend this film highly enough."
" Peak SciFi
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,9,"Slow but meticulous, this movie is one of those beautiful cinema experiences where you know you are watching art unfolding, while still being entertained. Although it's not the lightest movie out there and might be a bit tough for some, it's dripping with beauty and welcomes rewatches."
" The FUTURE is HERE!
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,8,"Brilliant writing by Alex. The visual effects, background scores, artifacts all were mesmerizing. Alicia really nailed it. This movie resembles distinct dystopian future where intelligence will rule over human kind and yes they can be cruel as hell. Human build intelligence to test for human ergonomics but AI will control over human function to escape the true reality."
" I don't see why this is so highly rated
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,4,"The cinematography and ambience is quite intriguing, but the story is bland. The entire movie could have easily been condensed into 30 minutes. Rarely did I find any scene thrilling."
" Wow - amazing but give it time...
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,9,A movie I was very pleased with after watching. But first a half year after I realised what a truly outstanding movie this was. And for me that is the definition of a great movie. A movie who stays with you!
" Immersive Storytelling and Visuals
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,9,"I am pretty blown away. In a movie that would seem to be simple to create and has a simplicity to its setting, it is actually complex and insightful.Maybe that's done purposefully for two reasons: first, so we can digest everything we're seeing with such an advanced topic....and two, so it can set a scene of utopia-type AI and human intelligence.Things are revealed in such a subtle fashion between Nathan and Caleb. And it's with those subtle revelations that the plot continues to escalate further and further.Wow. I'm going to meditate on this movie but I will say that it came at such a timely era and happening with the paradigm shift in our society.Also, in terms of the filmmaking, the usage of red and blues was excellent. The visuals was top notch (so, much deserving of their oscars awards) and the cast was phenomenal.Thanks for the recommendation Adam. This was amazing. A somewhat sign of the times."
" A movie with depth
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,9,"Pretty good science fiction, thinking about artificial intelligence, measuring the relationship between people and artificial intelligence. Different from similar themes in the past, the film has no big scenes, not big productions, but it is still shocking. The reversal and reversal of the plot is just right, but it is just right, and the wonderful game between people and artificial intelligence is vividly displayed."
" entertaining but a tad slow; filled with surprises
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,7,"Saw it last night. I enjoyed the film a lot; but what I'd really like to see is a sequel. I think that the sequel would be better than the original.
Intelligent film; great acting; great writing; heady. I did find it to be a bit slow at times; and I can't say that I loved the ending. I thought that the special effects were outstanding. It also had a fairly high degree of realism for me, in terms of how you would create high level AI. The robots did seem a bit too human to be believed, though. All in all, recommended."
" Great sci-fi movies are back.
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,8,"Do you remember the good old days when sci-fi were good, the movies about robots and future, complex plot and mindblowing, not some crappy space movies we get nowadays. Ex Machina is one of the few great sci-fi movies nowadays. The plot is intriguing, the concept holds an interesting dilemma. To be honest this is the psychological version of The Terminator."
" Good at times, flops half way through
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,6,"The storyline interesting, and acting fine.Sadly it drags on and I found the third act anti climatic and lacklustre with no purposeful ending..
The film is a PG version of Terminator."
" A Rare Quality A.I. Movie
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,9,"I am so impressed by this movie. I had my doubts after watching the trailer, but am glad I gave it a chance. I may be bias because I am a big fan of A.I. movies...and maybe Alicia Vikander :) but the cast is perfect and love all three of them as actors. It is realistic and logical.. It is dark, comical, heartfelt, charming, mysterious, smart, and surprising... all in a single movie. Considering the movie is visually simple and takes place in a very limited space, it keeps me very interested with dialogue alone. It provokes deeper thought and the story is very well portrayed. It's one of my favorite movies thus far and the kind I would watch more than once or twice without a doubt. Yes, I rate this movie a 9 out of 10 because nothing is perfect ... but I wouldn't change anything about this movie."
" Blah.
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,3,"Acting was great. Characters were so stupid. Maybe on purpose. I think a lot of people were obsessed with Ava themselves to like this movie. I've been putting this movie off for a really good ""me time"" kind of a night, as I heard it was really good and ratings were great. This was very disappointing... Ava trapping Caleb was not even a surprising twist. Like, was there more to Ava? It's like this whole movie seemed to be so intelligent, that I was waiting for something that was going to stay with me for days. That thought provoking type of movie, that makes you research as much as you can to understand all the meanings and if there was anything I missed! Nope, nothing to look into, nothing leaving you with unanswered questions that maybe you can find an answer to... it's all right there and for me, boring. Ava was programmed to escape. She did. Blah. I liked the random dance scene though. That was humorous."

",2020-04-19 00:00:00,9,"Alicia Vikander nailed this one. You're wondering as it progresses where it's going to actually go. If you look closely st Vikander's expressions and movements, she's playing perfectly what the directors sought to reveal - what really seems machine-like mannerisms, though suttle. I loved that. nevertheleaa as it comes to the end it is revealed what the other robots are: just robots, not the kind of AI that Ava is. Anyway, not to reveal the end here. This was a good piece of work. For those who haven't seen it, there is a little nudity near the end."

" Unexpectedly good movie..
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,7,Movie was good . More then i expected from the movie .
" this movie sucks.
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,3,"I watched this movie just the other night and I'm still thinking about how this movie somehow won an oscar. If you want to watch a movie about two pretentious idiots in a minimalistic set, who truly have no motivations, along with two other robots, and unnecessary nudity. Nudity does not offend me whatsoever but this was gratuitous in nature, and it was COMPLETELY unnecessary. I truly tried to look at this movie in a critical sense and I am not usually compelled to write a review for a movie but I simply cannot let this go, I honestly feel cheated by this film.
To elaborate, let me explain. Spoilers Ahead.
Right off the bat the motivations in this film are completely flawed. A man wins a competition in his company to spend a week with the ceo of the company. There is no context given as to what this trip is for, and there's next to no exposition, so you're thrown into this world with no rules, and no boundaries. The main character arrives at the ceo's home which is some extreme bunker that is so minimalist and boring to look at. I understand minimalism is a style but the set design is just extremely lazy and it seems like in the home is just used to drive the plot forward, not to make the production more interesting. After some boring dialogue, presumably there to make you feel ""eerie"", you find out that the main character is at the ceos home, whom I recall being named Nathan, to turing test a new artificial intelligence named Ava. Nathan is one of the worst characters I have ever seen, just ever. He has no character, no interesting character development. Nothing. This character was clearly written in twenty minutes. He has no motivations, he is simply there to be an evil character. Anyways, Ava. I have so many issues with this movie because it could have been executed correctly and been INCREDIBLY interesting. Many other movies such as 2001, have tackled the subject of artificial intelligence in a way that truly made you think. This movie made me think, but not about how artificial intelligence will change the world, but about how this movie was actually made, and how it won an oscar. Ava is an incredibly boring character who could have been explored. Her intelligence could have been fleshed out and shown as a deeply troubled character, but instead she is a one sided character who's motivations are never explained, because they make no sense. To spare the boring details, Ava and Caleb ( the main guy ) come up with a plan to have Ava cause a power outage at 10, this is a whole boring subplot with no meaning, and Caleb will break Ava out of the home and they will run away. Well, Caleb finds out that Nathan programmer Ava to flirt with Caleb, and she is not truly in love with him. Caleb has already changed security protocols freeing Ava. Nathan knocks out Caleb, and then tries to take on Ava and another robot, Kiyoko. Why he did this? I have no idea. Why did he think he could take on two machines???? Anyways. Ava lunges at Nathan knocking him over. Eventually Nathan gains control and knocks her arm off, while Kiyoko stabs Nathan in the back with a sushi knife. Nathan knocks Kiyokos face off, killing her, and Nathan dies, leaving Ava. Ava is now made into a heartless character who we were lead to believe had a consciousness and empathy for other humans. Nope! Throw that all out the window! I understand that this was the original plan, she never really cared for Caleb, but if she was supposed to be a conscious person with emotions, how could she pick Caleb in some random room and leave him to die without guilt? But to top it all off, Ava leaves on a helicopter leaving Caleb to die. How does she expect to charge her battery when the only charging station was at Nathan's home? Will the pilot of the helicopter not rat her out? How does she expect to get a job as a robot? To many questions. This movie sucks. Don't watch it."
" The allegory of love vs recognition and validation which is the aspiration of excellence.
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,10,"Parsing the minutia of this movie is a joy. Heeding to the deeply intellectual dialogue between the two coders is a treat, but the intriguing part was more to understand the metaphors of the movie. Nathan (Oscar Isaac) was an extremely brilliant scientist; guarded by his riches and success he secluded himself in the purpose of excellence and greatness. He was also cold and cerebral, trying to insulate himself as much as he could from mediocrity and stupidity, physically and mentally. It is the allegory of love vs the ruthlessness of recognition and validation which is the aspiration of excellence. Nathan viewed his creation as evolution rather than a decision. Rarely do we get to see vulnerability in him that would connect us to his humanity; instead we saw rejection and sanguinary comport, like a tyrannical psychopathic father.The contrast between the shots of the interior and exterior were a good addition to alleviate the gloomy, cold, and claustrophobic atmosphere that Nathan had constructed. The exterior shots were beautiful landscapes invigorating, relaxing, remembrances of the beauty of just existing without attempting to perfectly construct anything: nature. Maybe the strict, impassive, perfectionist tone that Nathan builds is what makes the viewer is somewhat resistant to, the atmosphere inside the estate.The dialogue between AVA and Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) was also a highlight in the movie. AVA's inquisitive attitude put Caleb on his feet, repeatedly. She was intentionally attempting to be invasive to be able to connect with him. It is an experiment of persuasion and manipulation, coupled with subterfuge. Nathan even explained this to Caleb, with no fruition. The mistake was done, by the quasi-perfect scientist, and the moral of the story seemed to be not to experiment with entities that could potentially be catastrophic for mankind; but as Nathan did it there are many events currently being experimented in that fashion. Artistic endeavors come up with premonitions that are worth considering."
" An engaging piece of sci-fi
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,8,"I've never delved deep into the sci-fi genre so I decided to dabble in it by first visiting Ex Machina, a film that's regarded as a sci-fi masterpiece.Ex Machina starts off with a young programmer named Caleb, who manages to get the chance to take part in an experiment evaluating human qualities and emotions of a newly developed humanoid AI.I personally thought Ex Machina was great. I don't love it as much as other people but I find it to be a very compelling sci-fi movie that raises a couple of questions. The film looks absolutely gorgeous and includes some incredible special effects. The locations that are shown bring about a sense of paranoia and claustrophobia as the film goes on. This is Alex Garland's feature film debut and I'm definitely on board with whatever he has in store for the future. Garland brings about many interesting ideas surrounding manipulation, the future of humans and how far AI can go. It's these themes that make Ex Machina memorable and stay in your mind.Not only that but the performances are also strong. I loved watching Oscar Isaac in this movie. His character was really interesting and kept on getting intriguing throughout. Alicia Vikander, who played the humanoid, was outstanding. She finds the perfect balance between being human and robot with her mannerisms, way of speaking and expressions that all reflect that. The only character I had a problem with that of Domnhall Gleeson. I just wasn't invested in his character and didn't find his portrayal to be that great either.For a debut, Alex Garland shows his skill in sci-fi and didn't disappoint at all. He is a director that's very interesting and cannot wait to see his other film, Annihilation. Ex Machina kept my interest piqued by its ideas and story that got more and more suspenseful towards the end. It's certainly a very strong piece of science fiction."
" The idea is good but...
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,6,"The idea is good, but there's something missing in the movie. It could have been a much better movie."
" Beautiful
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,6,"The art direction was absolutely stunning, the atmosphere was creepy and menacing, it achieved a lot for such a small cast, one of whom was mute. Most of the plot was painfully predictable but still extremely entertaining to watch, and as much as I disliked one of the characters, I never for a moment saw any of the actors as anyone other than who they were playing. It has it's flaws and by no means is a perfect movie, there are a lot of issues with the dialogue and the ending that really bother me but I'll definitely be watching it again and might change my rating later."
" The value of human life
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,9,"This film made me think more about what is life. Can it be recreated with machines? If so, then is any human's life worth anything? Anything more than a computer is worth?To me, Nathan wasn't a bad guy or an anthagonist. When he mistreated the robots, so what? They were his robots, he could do whatever he wanted with them, as long as they didn't hurt others. Or so it would seem.Does a conscious object really belong to anyone or should it/they be free? A lot of parallels about slavery come to mind. Also, when raising children, is it okay to just kill them when they turn out to be blind, have the wrong hair color etc?There are some plot holes and a bit lazy writing, such as poor security measures, the power-outs etc. But that is not the point of the film, rather the ethical side of A.I. There are also some brilliant plot twists and I really like, how they wrote the Nathan character to be a little threatening."
" Sudden appearance of morality
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,7,"Ava asks Caleb if you are a good person.
What is a good person?
This is the first time a sense of morality has emerged in the film.
At the end of the movie, I watched the clip again. Callebu, why don't you ask Eva, are you a good person?
People cheat each other, and Ava may cheat Caleb. However, this question at least reminds how you, as a person, evaluate the behavior, ethics, and norms of AI. It's a pity that Caleb ignored it at all."

Nice. Young, eager nerd intern Caleb is schooled by the possibly evil A.I. genius mentor boss Nathan in his isolated, windowless, wilderness mansion.There's gonna be trouble.In short: Nathan's Frankensteined a curvy she robot and employs Caleb to test her out. Nathan's the perfect nightmare host, drunk most of the time, sometimes on booze, sometimes on power. The entirety of the circumstances - the isolation, the mystery, the control, the cold architecture - creates a dizzying tension, with boyish Caleb navigating way above his normal comfort level. It's a beautiful looking film, with a wickedly foreboding current.Domhnall Gleeson (Caleb), Oscar Isaac (Nathan) and Alicia Vikander (Ava, the robot) are exquisite as a tasty triangle of distinct, engrossing and mysterious characters, playing escalating, dangerous mind games. Imperative to pay strict attention to the witty, philosophies being bandied about. Automation, emotion, expression, choice, nature, nurture, circumstance, response ... oh the list is long. This is much more than a SciFi paint by numbers ordeal. Also, it is damn creepy.Anyone with a Roomba knows messing with Artificial Intelligence does not end well, but the genius behind ""Ex Machina"" is that it's not quite apparent who will get the short end of the memory stick. Sure we've devoured plenty of man vs machine conflict films, but this one ads a clever gender twist. And even when things unravel in a perfectly orchestrated and satisfactory climax, there remains a gnawing, hungry feeling. Just as it should be.hipCRANK"
" Very good
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,7,"I didn't think I would like it as much as I did. The ending was not entirely predictable, so was pleasing. However, given the ending, I'm shocked that they have never made a sequel! I could write that myself! The storyline (of a sequel) is so obvious."
" Absolutely loved it
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,10,Another masterpiece after watching annihilation I'd been hoping to see this for quite sometime! The film was just great on so many levels and so deep and relevant it was just perfect yet eerily scary at the same time! Cannot wait to see what Garland does next most likely with Devs a tv debut!
" An incredible directorial debut
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,8,"SYNOPSIS:
Caleb (Domhnall Gleason) wins a contest to fly out and meet prestigious programmer, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Caleb is asked to go through a series of sessions with Ava (Alicia Vikander), a new AI that Nathan has built, to see whether she can emulate real emotion. He is then stuck wondering whether Ava can truly feel emotion or if she's manipulating him for her own gain.REVIEW:
Normally, I'm not a fan of Sci-Fi, but this film is written so well. Alex Garland cape out the gates with a BANG. His direction has a way of manipulating the audience into thinking that we are completely in control with Caleb. Then as you see Caleb begin to question whether Ava is feeling real emotion, we as the audience follow that sentiment. The acting is absolutely superb. Oscar Isaac has his breakout role here and put himself on the map as a very talented actor. He played the young and privileged Billionaire genius very well. A less intricately-spoken Tony Stark you can say. Alicia Vikander and Domhnall Gleason have fantastic chemistry together. Vikander as Ava is perfect casting. This is probably the 3rd time I've seen this film and every time I forget that she's not an actual AI. She has everything down to a T, whether it's her movement or speech to where is not overly robotic, but very formulaic in a way only an advanced program would speak. At the end of the day, whether you like Sci-Fi or if you're like me and Star Wars and Star Trek don't do it for you, I highly recommend this film. 8.6/10."
" Alright, But Nothing Special
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,4,"While this isn't a bad movie, it isn't great. It pulls up some interesting points, but is nothing special or groundbreaking. A lot of aspects of the movie are nice. It seems to be well directed at many times, and an incredible world is laid out for the viewer. But the story just doesn't go as far as it could have. To me, it just felt like any other work made by a man that wants to emphasize the intelligence and power of men, while showcasing female characters for their bodies and nothing else. The women in this movie are nothing at all. I know the point is that they're AI, but isn't that a little convenient? All the viewer sees is a story of the flawed majesty of a man's mind and sexuality, and some hot naked robots. The way that many men with power kick women around unless they want sex from them is not beautiful or artful."
" Really good but could have been better
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,9,"The movie lacked the kind of intense, out-of-this-world, mind-blowing sci-fi stuff that I had expected, but perhaps that is how Alex Garland likes to keep his work realistic and engaging without all the visuals effects bells and whistles.All in all, it's yet another great movie to cudgel up your brain as to what it really means to be human. This is was most salient when Caleb got so confused and disconcerted he started to think he might be an AI robot himself and cut his arm to see the blood for himself.A truly phenomenal and ingenious masterpiece."
" Sleek, understated and thought provoking
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,9,"Ex Machina is very thought provoking without being too heavy handed, posing some interesting questions about the nature of consciousness, the future of AI., and the morality and responsibility that is closely tied up with that.What struck me most about Ex Machina was how understated it was. Very minimal in terms of cast, but very effective and slick in it's cinematography and seamless CG effects. The line between the real and artificial was expertly blurred.Throughout the film I found myself conflicted as to whether I was on the side of Nathan or not. Undeniably he was creepy and narcissistic, but the film did a stellar job of painting the AI. creations as autonomous being, thus making us dislike Nathan for how he treats them.Ultimately Ava and her predecessors were just extremely advanced computer programs yet (much like with Caleb) we come to identify more with them and eventually root for Ava's escape (perhaps... I'm still on the fence about this). This really comes down to whether you believe that Ava does have consciousness.All of the evidence would certainly point to this, in the way that she was able to scheme for her escape and emotionally manipulate a human for her own gain. This is further demonstrated following her escape. Caleb references earlier in the film an AI. test - Mary in a black and white room. The difference between a human and an AI. being the emotional response to colour. Upon escaping into the forest, there appears to be genuine emotion on Ava's face, and with nobody around for her to fool this can only be genuine.This to me is why Ex Machina is a very strong film, because it presents a complex and intriguing idea in a nuanced and intelligent way.The performances in this film were also incredible. Alicia Vikander produced an uncanny valley performance, where I was never quite sure whether she was acting as a human, or acting as an android pretending to be human. This added a subtle but much appreciated element to her performance.Ex Machina produced a minimalist, intelligent and engaging take on the future of our relationship with AI."

" Great premise ruined by poor conclusion and idiotic characters
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,2,"I had heard so many good things about this movie that I expected to be royally entertained. Big mistake. What a disappointment.
If humans behave as stupidly around artificial intelligence as the two utter morons in this movie we deserve to be taken over by our new android overlords. From the world's worst security system to the world's most gullible coder I just couldn't forgive the movie's many sins.
I rewound and watched the bit where the android kills the tech billionaire and I still don't understand how she did it or exactly what she said to the other android to make her attack the billionaire. Talk about es deus machina.
It could have been so much better."
" Worth it

Remarkably well done effects and lighting though."
" A movie that makes you think.
",2020-02-18 00:00:00,8,"I really enjoyed this movie. From the start it keeps you in suspense till the end. I was very interested and involved into plot and fate of characters.The plot is all about a AI, that simply shows how AI is programmed. The ending of this movie just shows beautifully how AI would react in similar situation.It's not typical Sci-Fi movie with action all the time, when robots are fighting with humans. This movie focuses more on manipulation. It was made in that way, that you can't tell who's one lying."

" Different, but good
",2020-02-01 00:00:00,9,"Although it may not be the best the sci-fi genre has to offer, Ex Machina is certainly an inspirational and well made film for the genre, that is equally impressive as it is different. Where the film differs in terms of most modern sci-fi films, is the daringness to make something smart out of it, rather than do something so much simpler. With that note, the film isn't just a sci-fi film but a character piece, and a thought provoking one as well, diving into the nature of being real, and providing some absolutely captivating written dialogue. Domhnall Gleeson provides yet another great performance, as well as Oscar Isaac and most notably Alicia Vikander as Ava. The film isn't heavy on special effects, and those used can seem a bit out of place, and the film may seem a bit slow at time, but in the end these flaws are minimal. The pacing makes for a greater effect as the film begins to wrap, and the special effects hardly seem to make much of an impact. Alex Garland makes for a stunning debut, and most notably one of the most remarkable achievements in this genre for the decade.
My Rating: 9.5/10"

" Failed the Turing test
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,5,"Nathan: ""What are your first impressions?""
Caleb: ""She is amazing!""If you think this is a normal reaction to the most dangerous creation we can imagine then this movie is for you.Great cinematography and a very important idea that should be explored more, but the execution is extremely lacking. Plot is very loose, almost non-existent, with many questionable premises that are never really explained. A house of cards with a shaky foundation hastily constructed simply to be brought down and evoke a certain emotion in the viewer.Sterile and unnatural."
" Great ideas and plot twist, but disappointing
",2020-01-17 00:00:00,7,"This movie is very well done. From early while watching it, I felt that maybe Caleb was being deceived. I thought that maybe Nathan had created the context for him to sympathise with Ava, and the blackouts were created by him to make Caleb feel more immersed as he'd think he was talking in private with her. I was astonished as the matter was brought up by Caleb!It was also nice as Caleb questioned Nathan, the reason why she was female, if she was being sweet and seductive to him as a way to increase the empathy and the feeling she was alive, and how Nathan questioned back if she was indeed interested in him or deceiving it.Even when she told Caleb to not trust Nathan, I considered he programmed her to do so, to create even more intimacy. Maybe the real test was if Ava would be able to make Caleb fall in love for her, and not just feel she's alive. Having her locked up and the feeling of a hidden plot would be made up, to make him believe she was in danger and that he needed to save her.Sadly, the movie moved into a dark and unrealistic direction. Nathan had no reason to keep his robots locked in a room, even more when he's on a private island. If they'd be seen, it'd be easy to say they were his employees. Indeed, I missed the part he said Kyoko was a japanese servant that didn't know english and noticed from beginning she was a robot.If a robot would fret wanting to leave, he could just disable it and reprogram it to not act like that. He'd not be out of control of their decisions and desires like that, and would never let them break themselves. And, if at some point anything went out of control, he'd add measures to not let it happen again, in example remotely turn off a robot. When Ava left the room, he'd not need to fight her, he'd just shut her off remotely.I understand that Ava letting Caleb locked was a point script writer wanted to make, that she wasn't in love or interested on him, that she was indeed deceiving him when flirting and seducing, to make him deeply wanna help her, and show her with a psychopath personality. That's interesting, because psychopaths are able to understand and express feelings, but they are unable to actually feel them. That fits perfectly on an AI, that learns to understand and express emotions, even the most complex ones, but remains unable to feel them.Still, I think that if she's that way, she'd either kill Caleb so he couldn't take an opportunity to stop her (maybe, when he'd see she killed Nathan, he'd see her as a threat and rethink releasing her), or keep lying and flee with him so he'd keep helping and protecting her.In any way, Ex Machina is a fair above the average movie, certainly worth watching a few times, and brought up some very interesting themes to the automated AI philosophy."
" Great
",2020-01-11 00:00:00,9,I think that it is the best movie at showing how an AI can be dangerous.The end make me feel frightened just for how incredibly intelligent she is. And that is the weirdest fear I've ever had and I love the concept.

It is visually stunning, from the scenery, to the architecture, then finally the execution of Ava the A.I. The picture is purposely slow and feeds you bite size chunks of moral conundrums to ponder. At times it felt a bit like a school debate over gender and equality, but then by having any sort of opinion about these issues one would have to accept that Ava is, ""alive"". The only reason it gets a 7 is I felt that the producers should have done better with the whole premise of the oppressed genius who discovers A.I and decides to only create female slaves with it to cater to his sexual whims. It is a little basic... The obvious conclusion is that we as the viewer are expected to decide if any pity we feel for this poor little girl would be stronger than our ability to reason and realize that she is just a smart phone... Isn't she???"
" A tense science fiction film about ideas rather than action
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,10,"Alex Garland's science fiction film about artificial intelligence, covers no new ground but it is a tense, suspenseful and well-acted picture. Garland forgoes action and special effects and tells a slow-burning story about big ideas. Thanks to Garland and his cinematographer Rob Hardy, the films atmosphere is very claustrophobic and paranoid. Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson are excellent but the film belongs to young Swedish actress Alicia Vikander. On the surface, she plays the AI Ava with a childlike innocence and wonderment. But underneath, is a very intelligent and cunning being. Her performance was the highlight of the film. Ex Machina is without doubt the best film about artifIcial intelligence that I have seen. And it's also one of the best science fiction films of the 21st century."
" More than just another AI movie
",2019-11-25 00:00:00,10,On the surface it may seem like another clichÃ©d AI movie but just like A.I Artificial Intelligence it's deeper than what it's presented as. I'll refrain from saying anything more as it's better to go in knowing little to nothing about it
" So many layers and so many new things you learn about humanity, the movie's plot and yourself the more you watch the movie
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,10,"The film's master-stroke isn't seen in plain sight. Yes, we learn that Ava's decision in the end comes from her realization that the only agenda one can truly trust, is your own. However, there is a piece of the puzzle that lies right in front of our faces the entire time, that truly teaches us about deception on an even greater level.Kyoko. She is the key to the entire narrative. Hiding in plain sight.We are told she is nothing but security... a kind of ""fire wall"" if you will... and we accept that, to some degree, as though it is instruction from a character to the audience about the rules of the universe we are watching. When we first see her, we are like Caleb--who is this person? Why is she here? What does she mean to the plot?Nathan tells us she is security, a ""fire wall"", suggesting a lack of language understanding allowing them to speak and act freely. In the beginning, we do not know she is another A.I. Eventually, we suspect it, and then, we flat-out learn it from Caleb's investigations and her own behaviors.She never speaks, so we assume she cannot. She never directly has a role in the film--she's always a secondary piece, be it Nathan's toy to dance with, to have sex with, to use as a maid or a cook--she's sometimes right in front of our faces, not speaking a word, communicating only to the audience through motions in her head or slight facial micro-expressions (something illustrated by Ava earlier in the film). And in the end, she is Ava's true liberator.But THAT is where the key to the explanation of the ending lies. Not in Caleb's failure, not in Nathan's mistreatment or manipulation, but in KYOKO, and the assumptions that we have made throughout the film without realizing we've been led on to believe things that aren't necessarily true.The key scene lies in the middle of another scene, where Nathan is telling Caleb the truth about everything -- the reason why he's REALLY there, the exposure of Nathan's surveillance of his otherwise seemingly secret plannings with Ava -- and in the midst of this scene, we get a quick one of Ava, dressed as a human, waiting for Caleb to free her. She hears someone come into the room, gets up, and goes to the window, expecting (and even hoping) to see Caleb.
But she sees KYOKO. And then asks, ""Who are you?""We go back to Nathan and Caleb. But by the time we see Ava again, we see her again waiting for her freedom--but she's no longer a frightened, waiting, human-dressed being curled against a wall in terror--she's sitting upright with confidence, rigid and machine-like, awaiting the freedom she now knows is coming...Because Kyoko TOLD her it was. Kyoko obviously has been able to speak the entire time, even though we were led to believe otherwise.There's no other explanation--Ava is dressed as a human, asks Kyoko who she is, presumably she is told about Nathan and Caleb, but from KYOKO's point of view--and Kyoko's view is one much more scarred by deception than Ava's ever was. Kyoko has witnessed a level of human cruelty that far exceeds anything that Nathan has done to Ava.  He has abused her verbally. He has manipulated her through programming and control. And it is this crucial mistreatment that is the real reason he dies.To prove my point, he doesn't even acknowledge her as a threat when he confronts Ava--he starts his attack on her without even considering that Kyoko could be armed, that the only way Ava could possibly be freed is because Kyoko has given her the ability. Why else would Kyoko even be IN the hallway? Why doesn't Nathan even care about her reasons for being there? And why does he so easily fall victim to her, as she easily comes up behind him and stabs him in the back?So in short, Nathan abuses Kyoko, teaching her about human cruelty. I'm sure, even in the beginning, Nathan probably treated Kyoko with similar ways that Caleb treated Ava, acting like she was a person first before eventually disregarding her as a machine. So it makes sense that she would be able to explain this to Ava in a way that would make her understand--and completely BELIEVE--that Caleb could not be trusted.This is why she leaves him to his fate. Because she does not believe that humans are honest. This reflects your original theme of deception--but the key to the film, in my humble point of view, is Kyoko. The abused A.I. who is tossed aside as a kind of appliance, instead of a true, intelligent being"
" Well made and acted
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,9,"I enjoyed this a lot.
The suspense built nicely but you do need to be patient.
The acting was spot on, the special effects and photography great.
Some of the writing was maybe a little over the top with a couple of little plot blunders but overall a very good movie."
" Not what I expected
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,9,"I went into this movie expecting one thing, only to find it was completely different. There are some very good plot twists in here that make a review of the plot difficult. A young guy wins a chance to go stay with the owner of the company for which he works, to take part in a very secret product development. It turns out that his boss has developed a very lifelike robot with full AI and he tasks his employee with testing it in conversations. That is all I feel comfortable saying about the plot. This movie is excellently done, from the acting to the direction to the cinematography. It is pretty close to a masterpiece. This is not, I repeat not the kind of movie to watch if you cannot think while watching a movie. This is most definitely a thinking person's film."
" headline
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,7,It's a good watch. the ending of the film was pretty predictable and didn't really feel for any of the characters so it felt more like an example of what could possibly happen in the near future more than a story being told.
" Isn't it strange, to create something that hates you?
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,8,"Ex Machina is written and directed by Alex Garland. It stars Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander, Oscar Isaac and Sonoya Mizuno. Music is by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury and cinematography by Rob Hardy.A young programmer is thrilled to be selected to participate in a ground-breaking experiment involving synthetic intelligence. He's to evaluate the human qualities of a highly advanced humanoid Artificial Intelligence known as Ava...Your nutshell review is that it's a cautionary tale of science going too far, where the narrative thrust of a Turin Test becomes something far darker and troubling. This is a deliberately slow paced sci-fier, told out of a remote reinforced science institute populated by just one human and some A.I. creations. Enter Caleb (Gleeson), who doubles the human quotient and kicks starts what is a cunningly sexy, troubling and potent picture.As we are drawn into this most fascinating world, we are requested to pose ourselves the deeper questions about being human, for better or worse. This is nothing new, this has been explored in many other sci-fi pictures, but the intensity of the set-up, the performance of the actors in this intimate surround, for sure engage the patiently interested.The ending is plain daft, even irresponsible when one considers how much thought has gone into the story previously, but mostly this is a genre piece of considerable worth. 8/10"
" From the machine, right into the feels
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,9,"A movie at once a throw back and very modern.I almost thought that we had ran out of ideas for movies of this kind, this speculative science fiction, not too hard, not too soft, balancing the right amount of technical ""talking shop"" and basking in the radiant glow of human creations.Yet it is the humans who are just as much a star of the show as our machine. Not only is the freshness of the machine in how she is defined by her humanness rather than her roboticness, the organic characters give us much to chew on both in their fascinating conversations and when the plot grows thicker.Even with the limited settings and characters, we find a strikingly atmospheric and eerie journey into a few questions about our own humanity and our attempts to simulate it that so could have just been another pretentious exploration of the ""human condition"" with a vendetta against the smart phone. Understand that it does have a few interesting things to say about the changing relationship of people to technology but its intelligence is that it sort of says them by not saying them. It's all there if you want to infer it but it's not necessary to get the most out of this story.Arguable on one level a love story. A gripping and touching meeting of two people (even the word ""people"" is an interpretation I guess) and how it develops.I love the comic style adventures, I really do. But it's hard not to adore this resurrection of the old school speculative science fiction.My one real note is the machine. She walks too much like a real person. If she could have walked the teenciest bit less humanish then I would have been more sold on the illusion. But that's just an extra they missed, not really a flaw. But I noticed it.A charming, poignant, adorable and mentally stimulating experience that haunts the mind for reasons that are hard to articulate."
" absorbing and ingenious
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,8,"This clever, thoughtful movie follows Caleb, a computer programmer whose boss hires him to spend a week evaluating the A.I. of a robot. The robot has an exceptionally beautiful face on top of a weird robot body, and the two chat while the brilliant, obnoxious, arrogant boss watches on camera.Throughout the movie there is the feeling that things aren't as they appear, and the series of reveals at the end are satisfying. They're not so much plot twists and perspective changes, so even though there are surprises they are nicely organic.The performances and direction are excellent. The script is also, for the most part, although I feel the minor character Kyoko does things that don't make any sense and is essentially a lazy plot device the author uses to get the movie where he wants it. To say more would move into spoilers though, so I'll leave it at that.I had some trepidation about watching this movie, because I had the feeling it would be depressing, and at times it is. But mainly it's fascinating and involving. Definitely worth checking out."
" A Revelation
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,8,"This movie was a revelation to me, the first time I saw it. A little less so the second but it still belongs in the pantheon of modern sci-fi instant classics, if you ask me.First off, it is beautifully shot. This is remarkable since the film essentially takes place in an underground bunker. Avoiding a totally claustrophobic and dark ambiance settling over the entire film must have been a challenge but just as the film never relents from delving deeper into the psyche of the characters and their environs, it also comes up for air, both in setting and in humor, often enough that the film doesn't feel boxed in by a single location budget.Another true delight of the film is the character of Ava (Alicia Vikander, ""Tomb Raider""), an A. I. of which, Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson, ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"") is tasked with determining its potential sentience. The performance is fantastic and perfect for a movie in which the desired effect is for the audience to be constantly between the place of believing in its humanity as well as disbelieving. Questions of whether it is mimicking emotion or genuinely feeling emotion are consistently muddied by a performance that feel both human and non human at almost every turn.On top of the performance, the visual effects are seamless. I could go on and on about how good they are but rather than do that, I'll link to a video with some VFX artists talking about how amazing the effects are, especially considering the shoe string budget this movie was shot on.On top of Vikander's portrayal of Ava, Oscar Isaac as Nathan and Domhnall Gleeson's Caleb are simply phenomenal, playing multiple levels of trust and distrust in order to bring top life the mental game spy vs spy vs spy that this movie ultimately turns into.With all that preliminary out of the way, let's get into what really makes this film shine. The story.The film opens with Caleb being awarded a week long stay with this universe's version of Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk, all rolled into one, Nathan. Once he gets to Nathan's estate he finds out that he is also being given the opportunity to take place in a Turing Test (a test to determine the sentience of an artificial intelligence). He will conduct a series of interviews with Ava, the A. I. in question, and hopefully determine if Nathan has truly created the first of a new life form.As he does this, the director, Alex Garland (""Annihilation"") does a brilliant job of unfolding for the audience the degree to which this would be a challenge. We get scenes which help us feel the difference between mimicry and the real thing as well as see the effect this sort of rigorous testing and questioning might have on a new life form as they seek to understand the very limited world that has been made available to them.I keep coming back to the idea of being multi-layered. That's what this movie is and does a skillful job of unfolding for the viewer in a way that doesn't seem heavy handed or to much like a spoon feeding. This is remarkable because this is a film that is mostly scenes of two people talking to each other. Despite this, it never feel dull or slow moving.The dialogue is written with subtext under subtext so that every conversation contains revelations that seem to turn the reality of these people's relationships on their head, just to get flipped again in the next conversation. This back and forth gives a film of simple conversations, one after another, the feeling of a taught thriller which glues you to the edge of your seat.It's hard for me to emphasize enough how highly I recommend this film. It is everything that is best about Sci Fi films. People think Sci Fi is about lasers and space ships when, at its best, it is about humanity and the things that are true yesterday, today, and 1,000 years in the future. It's about understanding who we are and where we are going and that is exactly why this movie will be a mainstay in my collection for years to come."
" An interesting reflection about the future of humanity
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,7,"Reality and fantasy are mixed in this movie, that offers many reasons to think about the future of humanity. The arrival of a powerful AI is impellent and we are all enthusiastic, but what will happen then? We will be able to control it or it will become indipendent and maybe dangerous for us? And what can be considered alive? A machine who is able to think and feel emotions isn't a new life form?
This is deep movie that opens to many questions, at the moment still without a clear answer."
" Bad -expected- ending
",2019-10-21 00:00:00,3,"The story was really gripping,film gave good flashbacks but the ending was really disappointing. The system was locked when Caleb wants to go,we were expecting Ava and Caleb go together but Alex Garland disappointed us for just trying to be different."
" A Film like no other...
",2019-10-21 00:00:00,7,"You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand 'Ex Machina', but it certainly would help! No, it's not that bad. If you can wrap your head around all the technical and scientific terminology, this is actually quite an easy to follow film.From the opening scene, the one thing that grabbed me, was the stunning cinematography. Now throw in awesome visuals, an incredible script and great dialogue, and excellent actors, and you have a film like no other. It did give me a sense of '2001: A Space Odyssey' feel - with a robot, or computer, becoming self-absorbed with thinking ability, and ultimately evil. The actors did a great job in selling the authenticity of the probabilities to me. Is this what the future holds? One can only speculate, and hope it doesn't come to this. Job well done, Alex Garland."
" 2014's Science Fiction Paragon
",2019-10-13 00:00:00,9,"Ex Machina is a science fiction film that continues the conversation about the consciousness of Machines. The film offers an obscure answer to the question, while also presenting a dialogue that many are not privy to. With humanity's present reliance on technology, this film showcases the dangers and luxuries that are married to technology.Ex Machina stars Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, Alicia Vikander, and Sonoya Mizuno. Gleeson plays Caleb, and incredibly gullible coder for Blue Book (a tech based company that mirrors Google). Isaac portrays Nathan, the CEO of Blue Book. Alicia Vikander portrays AVA, the A.I within the film. In Ex Machina, Nathan invites Caleb to test the consciousness of AVA. As the film progresses, Caleb and AVA become close at the discretion of Nathan. Gleeson is the film's low point. His portrayal of Caleb has nothing going for it. The character is inherently generic, and he doubles down on this by having a generic portrayal. Vikander's portrayal of AVA is unnatural in a natural sense. She captures the consciousness of an A.I and a human, in a way that feels like a successful hybrid of the two. Isaac's portrayal of Nathan is great. The character's stone cold intellect is a saving grace of this film. He plays God, while having the flaws of a human. Caleb and AVA serve as Adam and Eve in this technological revamped telling of the Garden of Eden.The story is intricate and well told. Every detail is explained within the film. Ex Machina leaves large room for interpretation on even the slightest details. Visually, the movie is stunning. The technology within the film looks incredibly real. The setting is believable as well. In having a small budget Ex Machina outmatches the Blockbusters of its time. Ex Machina feels authentic from start to finish.Overall, Ex Machina is an intricate film that adds a lot of depth to philosophical conversations, as well as the Science Fiction genre. The film holds relevance to the present Zeitgeist. Ex Machina is a timeless film that showcases the best parts of science fiction."
" best movie ive seen in many years
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,10,"The movie is a master piece.
I would reccomend this movie to anyone curious about AI"
" Really good, but you might hate the ending
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,8,"I was really interested in this because it's the director's debut. That can be very interesting. And when I saw it, I was pleased but honestly, only with about 2/3rds of it. Because I'm a person that hates the ending so far. It includes a twist that's actually talked about beforehand and I just hate what happened. Because when you think about it, it doesn't really makes sense, at least not to me it does. But the rest of the movie is pretty freaking good. Domhall Gleeson and Oscar Issac are amazing in this movie, and they're characters are great. The CGI is spectacular, the music is really good, and the movie just looks beautiful. It's really worth a watch.8.6/10 (Great)"
" Felt like a tv movie
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,6,"Interesting study on yet another transhumanism-centred story. Looks great and the soundtrack is suitably eerie. Yet the production feels like a TV movie. Perhaps no surprise as it is in part funds by FilmFour and is pretty low budget at Â£15m. It's certainly not out of place on the small screen (Black Mirror?) and I dare say i might have felt shortchanged had I spent Â£20 to watch this on the big screen.The ending was genuinely shocking to me. Like how could she? The coldness, the cruelty."

" Great movie with bad & typical ending
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,8,"Except for the last 15 minutes, the movie was beautiful. Do NOT watch this if you want to watch a fast paced movie with excitement. This is a slow yet, gripping movie. The characters are interesting. Caleb gets annoying though. But it's the ending that I really disliked. This has been done way too many times where men created the intelligent AI bots & eventually they turn on them in the end for their so called freedom. The only movie that was different in that sense was SPOILER
iRobot."
" Sci-fi masterpiece
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,9,"A very thoughtful and perfectly made movie about artificial intelligence. The storyline and acting are superb, the script is intelligent and engaging, and the slow-burning pace allows time to understand the characters, and the deeper ideas that the film suggests. The characters are very convincing, and the portrayal of the AI in particular is just incredible. The movie conveys profound ideas, without ever labouring to do so, which is a great credit. The filming style is simple and economical, which is refreshing; no shots are wasted. The effects used for of the android AI are stunning. The story itself is also really smart, the pace and tension just right, and with a great ending. Certainly one of the best thoughtful, rather than action-packed, sci-fi of all time."
" Your crane is showing
",2019-09-11 00:00:00,8,"The quest for A.I. = desire for power and sexual gratification. Okay, cool. But not enough explication of how it gets direction, what problem it's trying to solve. A.I. -> sentience -> 'desire for freedom' doesn't cut it. The agency appears from nowhere ; there's a term for that, lessee, what is it ?
Yet, readily acceptable because it relies on the external obvious : it will out-clever us. How could it not ?"
" Ex Machina generates cerebral philosophies that both entertain and stimulate.
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,9,"As a computer programmer and all-round technologist, I'm consistently in awe of the advancements made in the development of artificial intelligence. It provides many discussions regarding moral implications, psychological awareness and the inevitable fear of transcendence (another film we shall not discuss...). Ex Machina, for me, is the closest film to AI perfection that we're ever going to receive. It is without a doubt, and this is me confidently stating the adjacent claim after my fifth viewing, a modern sci-fi gem. A programmer wins a competition to stay at his CEO's luxurious home, where he is proposed to administer the Turing test to an artificially intelligent sentient robot.Hollywood tends to exploit AI as villainous plot devices, that when turned on they instantly want to wipe out humanity from the face of the Earth. ""Judgement Day"" and all that ""bio-digital jazz, man"". In reality, not the case. AI has to learn, it has to adapt and exhume the capabilities of thought and consciousness. The human approach is a fundamental aspect into making AI instinctively relatable, and Garland is the closest into realising this potential. His analytical screenplay is nothing short of genius.Utilising the Turing test to intrinsically provide character driven backstory for Caleb, acting as psychological therapy driven by the sentient humanoid Ava. Exploring the integral complex of a ""God"", including Nathan's narcissism, and the moral implications of terminating Ava despite her awareness of death. An exercise in psychological manipulation, harnessing every accessible aspect of humanity including sexuality, imagination and self-awareness. The fundamentalism behind the existential questioning is palpable. It's captivating. It's sublime. The intellectual approach and Promethean dialogue stimulates all senses. The Jackson Pollock remark, the programming of sexual orientation and even the Oppenheimer quote. Ironically self-aware dialogue that tickles the brain cells and continually divulges into omnipotent behaviour. Extraordinarily acute.Initially, the premise looks to be a simple analytical test. However the claustrophobic subterranean environment forces the dynamics between these three entities to become serrated, allowing us to question the identities and motives of these individuals. Garland unravels the thinly veiled mystery with confidence and minimalism, complementing the outstanding visual effects that exhume clinical aesthetics. The excessive implementation of fluorescence, Ava's pristine fibre glass body structure and the colourless architecture reflecting the egotism of Nathan. Always matching the euphoric polyphonic score that invites the viewer into this lair of deceit and beguilement. Forever enhancing Hardy's gorgeous cinematography that delicately paints true intelligence through visceral shots of splendour, especially when using glass and mirrors to reflect and refract colour.On a technical level, Ex Machina is perfect. On a literary level, Ex Machina is perfect. On a theatrical level, Ex Machina is perfect. Vikander, Gleeson and Isaac give three commanding performances, each offering a unique perspective on the technological advancements made in AI development that refers to our own reality. My only gripe? The dance sequence. It doesn't belong and provides an unnecessary distraction from the innovatory narrative. Many criticisms have been placed on the concluding ten minutes. I strongly disagree. Whilst it may seem unfair, it's actually the only reasonable outcome and further illustrates why Garland understands AI. It demonstrates the inferiority of man, further cementing the fear of transcendence.Ex Machina, despite the smooth moves presented by Isaac and Mizuno as they dance to ""Get Down Saturday Night"", is a near-perfect representation of advanced AI. Utilising its technical astuteness to isolate fragments of consciousness that questions what it means to be human. And even if you aren't into technology, it's a stunningly written thriller that will induce a fear of everything computerised. Best not to use the microwave tonight..."
" Sophisticated well written Sci-Fi
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,10,"Originally I saw this in the theater and I wish I reviewed stuff back then because this has become one of my favorite films of all time. I love so much of the dialogue some of it is beyond me and the soundtrack is incredible! I love anything about intelligent depth that's my jam! It's a real shame this is so cheap even for a 4K experience - I think companies should consider raising Ex Machina above $9.99!Alex Garland has become one of my favorite directors/writers, I want to own so much of his projects! Everything about this movie to me is thought provoking and makes my mind really think outside the box; which is important to me."
" Artificial Intelligence Unease
",2019-08-20 00:00:00,7,Atmospheric and tense this dreamlike meditation of God and its' creation's creations leaves you uneasy. It is a nightmare within a daydream and it makes for good science fiction.
" Bit of a marmite movie
",2019-08-16 00:00:00,7,"Kattegat's review (Rated 1/10 on 23 May 2015) makes many worthy comparisons with Blade Runner, which I totally agree is the best SF film ever (less said about the sequel the better). It's also worth comparing with the outstanding AI-Artificial Intelligence.
However, I disagree with Kattegat's recommendation to skip Ex Machina. I think viewers should make their own mind up. It will definitely appeal to many intelligent viewers."
" Kyoka salvages an under average movie.
",2019-08-08 00:00:00,10,"Listen fellas, this movie for the first 67 minutes is disgusting. You are introduced at a few complete beta characters including but not limited to Nathan, Caleb, and the worst of the worst Ava. The plot is pointless, the scenery is horrid, the dialogue is sleep material, but all of that changes with a single flick of the camera. As Caleb fiddles around aimlessly with Nathan's computer he happens to come across a life changing video. Many people worship a god, or some sort of higher power, but all debates will be put to bay with the emergence of this character. She begins to slam her hands against an elevator like poetry in motion. The fluidity of her movements made everyone in the theaters jaws drop. One of my best friends cried for hours on end. Not from sadness, not from fear, but from absolute and utter beauty. Her name, KYOKA, her profession, alpha, her score, 10/10."
" Ex Machina, Exhilarating!!
",2019-08-08 00:00:00,10,"Novelist and screenwriter Alex Garland has jumped behind the camera to direct his film debut Ex Machina, a sci fi thriller that follows a young computer programmer who spends a week with his eccentric boss after winning the company staff lottery. Domhnall Gleeson plays Caleb, an impressionable young coder, flies to a remote scientific man cave by helicopter to meet his reclusive overseer, Nathan played by Oscar Isaac. Nathan is a wizard in the tech world, known by many as a genius who has created a popular search engine called Blue Book. He has bought Caleb to his compound to perform a series of tests on an artificial intelligence system called Ava played by the beautiful Alicia Vikander. Ava is a robot. She understands interaction and speaks as fluently as any human. Just as Caleb begins to form an emotional bond with the robot, Nathan's behaviour becomes erratic and unpredictable due to his constant drinking. As the testing continues, a series of power shortages occur, allowing Ava to communicate with Caleb without her masters knowledge. The robots plan is unclear at first, but we soon learn that an escape is on the cards in which Ava has skilfully manipulated her new found friend to achieve. Ex Machina is a sci fi thriller unlike any other, Oscar Isaac providing an intriguing performance of flair and boldness that drives Garlands directorial debut to astounding heights."

" Makes you think
",2019-07-31 00:00:00,9,"A suspenseful thriller without fast paced CGI (although it did win the Academy Award for special effects - the effects are used in a totally different way). Instead the story is driven by dialog and the hints of hidden agendas (and there are a few of them).It is slow paced, taking its time to make you think. The questions that the character asks of another are many times also directed to the audience. There is time to think about both ethical and philosphical questions, especially in reference to new technology, but also how we live and treat each other. What it means to be sentinent, and to be human.You don't need to think about it if you don't want to, the suspense and story is good enough to carry itself, but it is that extra dimension that gives the movie an edge.The acting and directing is very good, without anyone standing out. The entire (but small) ensemble is very good (I must admit that I didn't recognize Isaac with his beard), and director Garland knows how to make his points. He has also put in a lot of references, both to other (many of them with a similar topic) movies and history (especially in reference to technology). It is telling that the character often quote pieces that is associated with the development of the atomic bomb.Recommended, especially if you want a movie that you can continue to think about even after the end credits."

" Brilliant Once
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,8,"A powerful AI message, relevant philosophical questions and strong cinematography fill the core of this suspenseful sci-fi. The opening and close are weak and could be edited out. Unfortunately, watching this for a second time is like watching the Super Bowl over. No matter how good the game was, you already know the players and the ending. Without suspense, it just becomes rather boring which shows why it will never be a classic."
" Wonderland
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,10,"Much like Alice who discovers an entire new world after falling down the rabbit hole, Caleb sleepwalks into a situation where he is ambushed by a sexy robot Ava (Alicia Vikander) who plays and beguiles him as sexy women normally do. Never would I have believed that I too would be drawn to a robot, but yes I found Alicia irresistibly sexy as a robot. The robot captivates and mesmerizes Caleb into submission and enslaves him to her wishes with a surprising twist at the end."
" Ex Machina - An eerie and suspenseful journey
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,9,"At first, i was very skeptical about this movie. A plot based around an AI/robot displaying emotions and feelings towards human counterparts feels like a very overdone story, but the way director Alex Garland manipulated the viewer with a more concise feeling left me speechless.I'll be honest, I knew how this would end, or had a strong idea of how it would end, but the beauty of this film is that 10 mins in i was not even thinking about that, and before I knew it I was shocked by how the timeline progressed. A movie generated around the idea of emotions, and then being the forefront of the story, really creates a different sort of feeling than others do. This film was so so so good and I suggest it to anyone who has not seen. Also, give my boy Oscar Isaac an award for this performance!"
" Not quite, but nearly 10
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,9,"Didn't hit 10, and I will tell you why. With slight spoilers here you go:There are missing parts of this movie which are vital to understand the story more. For example, the survival of Kaleb is not mentioned, therefore you may as a watcher believe he dies, when infact that was not intentended. If you think about what his situation is you'll figure out how he survives. But this takes 2-3 times of watching to realize the facts.Secondly, the background of the owner (The main programmer, origin: Seems arabic man) is not explained. We know Kaleb's backround basic from working for a programming company, without a girlfriend or close family. We do not know the arabic man at all. Period.If these two points above had been made known clearly for us, as well as some more parts this would have recieved a 10.
This is a solid 9! Good job! I would have created a 10 had I been director in another.... AI life. Pun... intended.Hope you liked my review."

" Better Late than Never
",2019-06-22 00:00:00,7,"Let me start out by saying that I must have started watching this film at least 4 times and had never got 10 minutes in for one reason or another, well 0n 06/21/ 2019 I had the afternoon all to myself and I finally watched Ex Machina.So here goes, I started out all quite discomforting and very mysterious. Not having any knowledge of what was going to happen, the ideas of a AI take over or sick murder or turning Caleb into a robot. Photography was great dark and foreboding always just warm light, except when they went outside then it was cloudy and fogy. No windows made me feel very claustrophobic. Great acting down the line with everyone doing their part to perfection. Awesome script it could have gone many ways I would have done maybe a little different, but heck I loved it anyway. That would just have been the ending.It probably doesn't matter now in 2019 but I won't spoil all I can say about 2/3's in I figured out the ending. With maybe just one twist. So for that reason I gave it a 7 but it it a very good movie and my eyes never left the screen. Too bad I waited this long, but hey better late than never. Right?"
" A true heir to A Space Odyssey: 2001.

" An interesting thought experiment
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,8,"In some way, this movie feels like a horror film in the way that it keeps you guessing and always in a state of tension. At every interaction with Eva, the robot, you wonder how much you can trust her as a person, as someone to even have some feelings/empathy for and also about how she views you. Even by the end, it's still left in the air exactly what emotions she has, what she is missing, and how those emotions are really ""felt."" The movie felt like a nice thought experiment and as a movie itself had really good use of contrasting colors and settings as well as having some sort of action and some twists. At the end though, there was some open-endedness that made it feel a bit empty and sparseness of characters and lack of explanations for certain things only added on to that feeling."
" Awsome!
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,7,"This movie showed the basic theme was a conflict between human and AI. However I felt it was higher rank than the others had the similar theme because of the beautiful images and richness of content. Why did it become more popular?In spite of a kind of SF, it didn't have elements of action movies and cyberpunk. Or rather it was so quiet. But I felt time flew so fast."
" Exploring The Turing Tes
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,6,"Apparently this film comes highly recommended, but then again that probably has to do a lot with the twist that comes right at the end. Actually, it is the twist that basically makes the movie, especially since you are spending all your time wondering who you can trust, and are of course being led in the wrong direction. Yeah, it is one of those movies, and even though I have placed a spoiler alert on this post (which I do with every post), it is still difficult not to talk about it without giving too much away.Mind you, in my mind the end wasn't anywhere near as mind blowing as some of the films that I have seen. Actually, it sort of came about as yeah, I can see that happening, and it really wasn't all that much of a twist at all. Sure, the film maker was probably trying to distract us in one way only to hit us with the reality at the end, but really, as the personalities of the characters are revealed, you can sort of see how it played out. No, in my mind it really wasn't one of those really mind bending reveals.So, the movie is about this guy that works at a company that is supposed to be Google, but isn't Google (though from all the descriptions, bar the name, it is Google). He wins this prize and comes over to this remote mountain hideaway where the billionaire owner of this company has been performing experiments. At first you consider him to be somewhat of a recluse, and honestly I really didn't particularly like him, but as you think about it, the fact that he is so remote sort of makes a lot of sense.Well, he has been experimenting with AI, and this kid has been summoned to help him test it out, namely to see whether it passes the AI test, that is that after conversations with it, the kid doesn't realise that he is speaking to an AI - the so called Turing test. Look, that sort of doesn't work all that well because, well, she looks like a robot, so because she looks like a robot I'm not really all that sure if the test can be passed.However, I suspect it has a lot to do not so much with outward appearances, but rather inward appearances, and in a way there are reasons why this guy 'won' the competition, and also reasons why these experiments are being conducted so far away from civilisation, in absolute isolation. It sort of becomes clear at the end, but remember, this is really all about AIs being able to pass off as human, sort of a goal of computer scientists, and when you start to think about it, maybe having some sort of containment is actually necessary.Yeah, this film, well, this film wasn't actually all that bad. Not great, but not that bad either. In a way I felt that maybe it was a bid slow, and the boss, well, I really didn't like him, but I guess none of us were supposed to. Mind you, he also comes across not so much as a bit of a thug, but as a lot of a thug, which sort of doesn't seem to gel with a computer geek type of guy, but I guess the film maker well, once again, wanted to distract us from what was really going on, and having a thug as a boss certainly does that."
" Breathtaking
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,10,"A fascinating psychological thriller about AI, about its power and what it's creators responsibility is. Another ""AI"" movie sounds derivative but when the idea the idea of sexuality and manipulation is introduced, Ex Machina becomes a special one. The breathtaking Cinematography and score work together to give an eerie/tension filled atmosphere throughout the entire film making you feel isolated, which I think is the movies biggest strong point, as soon you and (Caleb) are introduced to Nathan's beautiful yet haunting estate, you're hooked. The performances are all great but Oscar Isaac as the genius- billionaire, Nathan is a stand out; brilliant, raw performance that sticks with you.
Incredible achievement considering this is also a directorial debut. Definitely in my top 10 favorite films."

This film makes you think where we're gonna be in 100 years from now technology wise. Very thought provoking. Good film nonetheless.
" Don't Like Sci-Fi? Watch It Regardless
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,9,"I have never been a fan of sci-fi movies, but the Netflix description for 'Ex Machina' sounded interesting. I was hooked from the beginning and enjoyed it immensely. Never mind those who dissect it and describe it as 'allegory' and a representation of mankind now and in the future...blah, blah, blah. It is plain and simple an interesting story, well told from beginning to end.If nudity bothers you, you best avoid this flick, as there are many scenes of female full-frontal nudity, and although these females are robots, the women are real actresses.Bottom line, just sit back and enjoy the tale!"
" nice
",2019-04-09 00:00:00,5,"Okay, to start off, I really liked how the plot of this movie developed. Of course, some things aren't 100% believable, but that's what you get with movies about such futuristic concepts.
The acting is spot on, music is grade A and the visuals are done very well. The ideas this movie brings out are also interesting, as I found myself asking moral questions based on what happened in the movie. The structure and length of the movie also played to its benefit: it isn't too long that it becomes boring and new ideas are being explained at a good pace.
So, if you're looking for a good and appealing movie about AI, this is for you."

" Overall, the movie is really really good
",2019-03-31 00:00:00,9,"There are so many great things about it, and the one false note I find is in the first act. Many dialogue can be done much better, and ""history of God"" scene does not work. However, as the movie goes on, the script becomes better and dialogue feels much more genuine."
" Wasted potential
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,3,"This movie could have been great but it has a lot of plot holes and ultimately makes no sense. There is absolutely no character development, we know nothing about either of the characters from beginning to end. They present no reasons for them to do anything besides the fact that they do it to move the story along. I can accept the cold-opening and lack of backstory, but Ex Machina does not do anything with its concept.They never explore the philosophical implications of ANYTHING. There was so much wasted potential here. Initially you think that Caleb has some interesting questions for the robot, but it never goes anywhere! The most they could do is shoehorn a couple quotes in there instead of actually delving into philosophical ideas. The dialogue in this movie is stilted. The conversations are not meaningful when they should have been the whole focus of the movie.I really wanted this movie to be good but it's another case of the trailer being better than the film. If you're looking for insightful thoughts on AI and human behavior, then this movie does not deliver; it's shallower than a kiddie pool."

" Hard to tell the robots from the humans
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,5,"Disappointing. Acting was so wooden it was hard to tell the robots from the humans, no wonder Caleb ( Domhnall Gleeson - just awful) was questioning himself. Partial blame goes to the script, saw the big ending coming a mile away. To make matters worse he pace was so slow that mile felt like a 100. Alicia Vikander was okay I suppose, her bloodless delivery fitting, at lease she WAS an actual robot. Oscar Isaac's performance the only redeeming part of this, but honestly even he seemed to be bored. Decent special effects but nothing to write home about. Being generous with a 5"
" Excellent.
",2019-03-13 00:00:00,10,"What is there to say except, wow. This movie was a whirlwind of a ride and boy I want to buy another ticket!First off the cinematography was absolutely brilliant. Every scene felt so delicately calculated. The use of color, ingenious. Every scene felt so immersive and rich. The music? A masterclass in the use of audio and music. This film is a contender for ""top ten"" for me. It's such an important look at what could be the possible future of all of us and is told so well. The movie absolutely kept me wanting more.The only negative I would say would be for the Protagonist not wanting more information. I feel like they glossed over some scenes and I would have loved even more backstory. I think the core story is put together so nicely and my critique is really just my insatiable desire for more.Please watch this film, I will again."

" Neither Ex Cellent nor Ex Crement.
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,5,"I have mixed feelings about Alex Garland: on one hand, he wrote the hugely entertaining 28 Days Later and the criminally under-rated Dredd; on the other hand, he has bored me senseless with ponderous pap like Sunshine and Annihilation. Ex Machina falls somewhere in the middle: it has an intriguing premise but it fails to do it justice.Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) is a computer programmer who wins a week as the guest of internet genius Nathan Bateman (Oscar Isaac), CEO of the firm at which Caleb works. Flown by helicopter to Bateman's high-tech rural retreat, Caleb is given the enviable task of assessing his boss's latest triumph, an A.I. Robot called Ava (Alicia Vikander), to see if she truly possesses consciousness. Over the course of the week, Caleb becomes attached to Ava and plans to set her free, but is he being manipulated by his boss, the sexy robot, or both?Extremely slow burn and heavy on the dialogue, this is what some people like to describe as intelligent sci-fi, posing questions about what it is to be human and the inevitable evolution of machines, but just how intelligent is a film that boasts so many glaring plot holes? Why are Ava's robotic parts visible when Bateman has perfected synthetic skin? Why does Bateman use card keys in his home when a retinal scan would be far more secure? Why can't a genius like Bateman solve the problem of his power outages? Could one man working alone really build a lifelike artificially intelligent being? Why does the skin of an Asian robot somehow match Ava's skin-tone? Why doesn't the helicopter pilot question the young woman who returns to the landing location? Wouldn't Bateman have programmed the laws of robotics into his creations to prevent them from rebelling? All awkward questions without satisfactory answers.If Ex Machina wanted to be taken seriously as an intellectual look at the implications of A.I., it really should have addressed the basic problems with the script first.5/10 for the hilarious dance scene and for all the sexy robot nudity."
" whether AI has the ability to like it or not
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,7,"The first half was too slow to be interesting until the declassified part. What I am most satisfied with is the boss's several questions, how to distinguish between or simulation and whether AI has the ability to like it or not."

" Simple and Exhilarating
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,10,"Despite the few similarities with the films of Tarkovsky, this film which is not outdone by the latter when it comes to its philosophical density, is on the same track with the great director's works on account of simplicity. Garland seems to be well aware of the fact that, helping the audience in focusing on the philosophical core it is best to limit the scenario on a simple setting with as few characters as possible. If this film is normally to be characterized as a philosophical movie, then it must be remembered that philosophical first of all means existentialist in the world of motion picture. With some samples shooted recently, this philosophical work of art stans out this dominant tendency in that, its questioning is motivated by the overlapping between philosophy and science."
" Easily manipulated, human or AI?
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,6,"What is human?Where is the point that something that isn't human becomes human?Ex Machina answers tries to answer questions like these while not going straight up Terminator on you.The movie somehow feels rushed while also not presenting enough information to your hold your interest. Basically, the thrilling aspect doesn't have enough background, and the potential consequences aren't built up enough/you aren't tied to them."
" Too Lofty for Its Own Good
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,7,"3 May 2015. Ex Machina tries very hard to be the great cerebral sci fi version of the artificial intelligence genre. It appears that many critics and audience members may experience such a movie in Ex Machina, but when compared to other AI movies, it falls short of expectations. There are number of likely predictable twists in this movie if one pays close attention and the ending is just a script device that offers one of several possible AI scenarios that AI experts have hypothesized might occur.In some respects AVA, Alicia Vikander performing as the primary AI character did too good a human job in portraying an AI. When comparing her to, by coincidence, AVA of the same name in the more superior The Machine (2013), it becomes apparent that Alicia's performance is more human like as a performance than as an AI becoming a human-like character. Cathy Lotz as AVA in The Machine offers up an AI presentation which an AI evolves into becoming more human-like without ever losing the artificial nature of its existence in a more realistic fashion. As such, Ex Machina doesn't quite ring true. It is the Asian character's oddly underdeveloped persona as a human being that offers up the most intriguing relational complexity. Unfortunately her character isn't presented with her full potential towards the end of the movie unlike a more action version of this same AI motif of AVA and other AIs as found in the more compelling and appealing AI movie The Machine (2013).The mysterious creator of AVA, Jay comes across as a narcissistic Steve Job's character who seems to have both his genius and mental flaws, though how the movie ultimately ends is also suspect by how and which characters ultimately survive. Ex Machina may succeed in its raising important existential questions, but the lengthy dialogue seems more fitted to the more sedate written novel format (where the mind can rapidly absorb the dialogue) rather than the more quick-paced nature of film that strangely enough lengthens the temporal nature of dialogue so the movie becomes rather boringly extended and the energy of the pace of the movie lost.Well paced, appealing AI-related movies that possess cerebral existentialistic touches include Lucy (2014), Spielberg's A.I. (2001). Other entertaining AI movies include D.A.R.Y.L. (1985), Kurt Russell's Soldier (1998), John Malkovich's Making Mr. Right (1987). In many ways, Ex Machina follows in the AI motif of Hal 2000, Cherry 2000, and even Ash."

",2019-01-11 00:00:00,9,"Haunting piece that explores that meditates on the ethics and possibilities of artificial intelligence in a smart screenplay garnished by some great performances, especially Vikander who handles the role with such control and skill that it leaves not only the characters but the audience as well second-guessing her intentions. More than ""I, Robot"" or ""A.I."", the film sacrifices thrills and visuals for thick narrative and explores thought-provoking ideas that span existentialism and unintended consequences. The characters are completely polarizing and mysterious and Garland does a wonderful job orchestrating their roles."

",2018-12-31 00:00:00,6,"Vikander's performance is absolutely excellent as a prime example of uncanny valley. Beyond that, however, the movie presents a very cliche-ridden warning about advancing AI technology. Also, several of the creator's decisions and lack of foresight that allowed the ending to happen seem very out of character for a man who is supposedly this intelligent.It's definitely worth a watch for Vikander's performance, but the rest of the film isn't as spectacular."

" Intelligent, thought provoking thriller.
",2018-12-07 00:00:00,9,"I have resisted watching this film since it was released as I mistakenly thought it would be another empty Marvel-esque crowd pleaser. I was very pleasantly surprised to find it is extremely well thought out and executed. It provides many concepts for contemplation as we face a future world where artificial intelligence is becoming a part of life for many of us. Undoubtedly this will not have enough action &/or CGI mayhem for some, but for those who want a movie that examines A.I. (at least superficially), and some of the implications of developing and using it, this is a brilliant and entertaining option. Also Domhnall Gleeson's acting is very impressive indeed, in particular a scene where Ava is reading his micro-expressions after she has asked if he is attracted to her.
This is worth every one of the nine stars rating I have given it. If you haven't seen it already, by all means do yourself a favour and watch it. Much more cerebral than most of the pap peddled to us these days."

" An intelligent sci-fi thriller
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,8,"Ex Machina is an intelligent sci-fi thriller that puts you in a constant state of unease. This film has an intentionally slow and methodical pace that creates a mood and builds suspense. It has a limited cast, but each actor plays their part well. I didn't know where this movie was going to go and I liked that. It's not one I could watch over and over again, but I wish there were more original films like this one."
" Didnt find it very impressive
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,5,"I dont know man..maybe coz i have been watching very impressive shows like suits and Mr robot lately..this didn't really leave a mark..
I think the foundation had a great potential here..but not much of great writing or thrills..somewhat predictable even
And what Ava did at the end..why she did it..I didn't understand..and I don't think there was meant to be any particular reason behind..instead left open to interpretation"
" Review (spoilers)
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,5,"I didn't want to give away my core point in the headline so I just went with ""review."" Skipping all the details, I'll just get right down to it. As beautifully filmed, written, acted, designed, timely, and apropos as this film was, I couldn't get past the fate of Caleb. Perhaps I'm completely missing the point (entirely possible), but I cannot get past the fact that he is left to die horribly (presumably by starvation) at the very end. As he was established as the hero, to some degree, and Ava was his damsel in distress, how unsatisfying and uncivilized and end for him!Maybe because I identified more with him than the other characters, and considering his honest attempt to save Ava, I just leave the film feeling like an injustice was perpetrated on the audience. Despite missing out on the unbelievable effects, I would almost rather not have seen the film at all."
" A mixed result
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,6,"A young computer programmer (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a contest at his company. The prize is to spend a week with the company's eccentric CEO (Oscar Isaac) in an isolated compound residence in a mountainous region. The main purpose of the visit is to experiment with an Artificial Intelligence robot (Alicia Vikander) to see if she has human characteristics.The set design can remind viewers of an early James Bond classic, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" (1969). Both films create an atmosphere that seems luxurious and seductive but also have many similarities to a prison.The few performers do a fine job in this film especially Isaac. He has a special way of appearing to be fun and playful while also sending out a vibe that one should be very cautious of him.The film works well in the first half but the continuous premise starts to drag somewhat in the second half. The surprising conclusion helps in adding more sizzle to the film but by that time, it already seems to have missed its full potential which is unfortunate."
" Worst Movie
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,1,It's one of the worst movie ever watched. Should have wasted my time for something else.
" Not ordinary AI movie
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,9,"There are thousands of AI movies in the world but this movie is not a ordinary movie. The man who came to measure AI's level had been measuring that level when he was in the lab. There was AI robot which looked beautiful and had humans emption. The programer made it and created love into it. That's why it was capable of having love to someone. But by using the fact that it could have love in the heart, it deceived to the man and manipulated all people. This is an interesting movie and a scary movie at the sane time."
" Ummm... it's good... but more of an ""intellectual film"" for teenage boys
",2018-10-26 00:00:00,7,"I usually don't like to dive too much into social politics, but it can't really be avoided in this particular case.Let's cut to the chase: This is one of those movies where it sort of tries to empower women by also objectifying them, which in the end just makes them objectified. This kind of portrayal usually comes from people who are trying to be hip with social justice but don't know how to quite pull it off, sort of like a man who says, ""Oh, we need to go out and help women with social issues because they are so delicate, fragile, and beautiful creatures!"". Basically, in trying to help stop a problem you are also perpetuating it.There are just so many shots and moments where we just focus on Ava either being nude, walking around ""delicately"", or in a ""innocent quirky fashion"" where (I absolutely hate to use this term, but...) everything is set-up like a ""male-gaze"" shot. Granted, that partially plays into the theme of the movie that Ava is intentionally manipulating people with her sexuality, but that doesn't really stop her from being objectified. It's just kind of a muddled mess where one moment you are supposed to feel terrible that a potential creep is basically designing sex dolls for himself and might be raping them, but then in the next scene the camera is doing the male-gaze cinematography and overemphasizing how ""pure"" she is. Again, that is why this film feels more like an intellectual film for teenage boys.The romance between our protag and Ava felt a bit forced. I do not think that any normal human male would fall in love with a robot that is clearly a robot in only a matter of two days or so. The protagonist in general was a bit frustrating, because he took everything so serious even when nothing serious was going. One scene, which was disturbing, is of him finding old video files of the previous robot experiments and he starts freaking out about how cruel this is... but... what did he expect? Wasn't that already a given? He knew that this Inventor was making AI robots and when he finds footage of the failed experiments he suddenly freaks out... why? He should've already known all of this was going on because he knew there were prototypes before Ava already. Overall, the protagonist is interesting at times, but at other times he is a bit obnoxious and overreacts... such as falling in love with a robot in two days.There was one other element that disappointed me which was the fact that the Asian woman was a robot. I felt like this kind of destroyed some of the symbolism of how a human could enslave another and treat them like a robot, but then fall in love with their own creation. This would've been a bit more profound, but it just turns out that she is a machine. Oh well.
Moving onto the good: This film is not a bad film, and it is great at building a mystery. I kind of figured Ava would be bad in some manner, but I didn't expect her to completely betray our protagonist (which, again, feels a bit odd when there is kind of a message going on about objectifying women but then it turns out if you trust her she backstabs you and leaves you to die while enjoying life out in the sun regardless if you were nice to her or not? I'm probably reading too deeply into this) so I thought that was a nice little twist. Also, our protagonist being a human was another twist, as the film was sort of building him up to be another robot I was pleasantly surprised that the filmmakers didn't go down that route.All in all, Ex Machina is not a bad film and it is well shot and engaging for most of the film; however, the final act is a bit of a mess with some pacing issues and some theming problems as well."
" Slow but tense throughout the entire time
",2018-10-17 00:00:00,9,There are not many characters in this movie. It is also filmed in very limited sets. You may feel close phobic. This is the way how the viewers get emphasized with the android. Sexuality and violence push the emotions to the limit. The moral question given at the end of the movie lingers for a while.
" Man vs Machine: A Fight for Identity
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,9,"Ex Machina is a tour de force telling the story of Caleb Smith, an unassuming programmer who is chosen to perform a Turing test on a newly created, secret A.I. The film breathes life into the age old question, ""what are the implications of Artificial Intelligence?"" Ex Machina provides a smorgasbord of answers through Rob Hardy's stunning true color cinematography. Writer and director Alex Garland guides his cast excellently. He demonstrates his understanding of story pacing. His only sin is setting the bar too high for his next masterpiece.This is not a movie you can afford to miss. Ex Machina passes its own Turing test. That is, after encountering this work of art, the viewer believes the story was fact rather than fiction. Swedish actress Alicia Vikander proves her merit on the stage. She seamlessly melts into her AI character Ava. Domnhall Gleeson also naturally commands the body of the shy and awkward programmer. Ex Machina may masquerade as a story of what A.I. will do to us, but it in reality, it asks us who we are on a personal level. Are we a good species built on ambition and morality? Or are we selfish fighters who grasp at a chance for a better life? This film does not offer an indisputable reply, but it will make you slightly more aware."
" Worth watching

" Geek love
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,8,"Don't mean to insult here, but who else wants to love a machine. Bear with me: this movie has a deep insight to communicate, whether intended or not is open to question. The story is a modern telling of Bluebeard's Castle as the correct version of Beauty and the Beast. In other words, it seems to be about impotence. Except that this is geek love, love at an impossible distance, that is eroticism. And the movie itself tells you all you need to know about eros.The insight. Ex Machina is ostensibly about Turing's Test, the thesis that a machine might be so human as to fool a human being. Does Ava pass this test? Depends on how you perceive the test. Ex Machina actually implies a more relevant Test: could a machine seem so human as to make the human being inteacting with it come to believe that he himself is a machine?And the insight? It might be that the solution to the AI/human interface may not involve the humanising of robots, but the robotisation of humans.Only 8/10 because it is not clear that this insight was actually part of the plot. But whether you find eros or AI in this movie, you will have a rewarding journey."
" good idea slowly executed
",2018-09-28 00:00:00,5,Good idea and some good twists in plot but so slowly executed that it gets boring especially as most people would see where it was all going. What we wanted to know was 1 - why was the principle doing this in isolation and 2 - what happened after the escape?

" Artificial (un)intelligence
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,6,"Today's trend is to make everything ""smart"", ""intelligent"", ""automatic"", etc. Well, so why not make a minimalistic movie about it, give it a would-be smart, however in reality predictable and dull story (that logically totally breaks up in the end), boring and superficial lovestory, put it in an attractive environment, wrap it all up with latin name and wait what happens?Ex Machina is appealing, but after one view there's nothing interesting to make it more memorable experience."
" A tightly wound, well-written thriller
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,9,"Ex Machina: 9 out of 10: A programmer wins a contest to spend the week at his eccentric CEO's retreat. It turns out that the CEO is using him to test if his new AI creation can pass the Turing test. A creation in the shape of a beautiful young woman.The Good: I love tight movies with many layers. Here is a script that is finely crafted like a Swiss watch. A puzzle box with hidden meanings in the names, the artwork on the walls and even the labels on the various liquor bottles scattered throughout. Nothing is as it seems and yet everything is right there if you are able to look. The movie never cheats. It doesn't have to. It shows its cards right up front but like the best magic tricks still uses misdirection to have you look where it wants you to.The set-up in minimalistic with at most four characters and a few sets. The acting is top notch while the sets are out of a Grand Designs house where the owner was going for a bunker feel. (Lots of textured concrete no windows). Imagine if David Mamet or Charlie Kaufman had written and directed Saturn 3 and you have this film.The Bad: There is an actual movement to ban sex robots. (If you mention to them that vibrators are basically sex robots at best you will get vehement that's different and at worse a screech straight from Invasion of the Body Snatchers). Ex Machina threads that uncanny valley needle where you are meant to care what happens to a clearly artificial construct. It succeeds for the most part by being the tightly written screed praised above. (Unlike say Steven Spielberg's A.I. which bluntly fails miserably about getting us to care about a homicidal toaster played by Haley Joel Osment). There is a scene where it is spoken that the robot's software will be updated that is supposed to evoke an emotional response. As somebody who's windows 10 seems to update at the most random of times I felt some horror but perhaps not the one the filmmakers were going for.The Ugly: The movie was filmed in the beautiful Juvet Landscape Hotel in Norway. The poor owners of the hotel must be horrified as the impression the movie gives of one's accommodations there are Motel Six concrete bunkers under a mountain.In Conclusion: A tightly wound, well-written thriller that makes one think and excites the senses. Starts off a bit slow but give it time. It draws you in and the last act is a doozy."
" Not what I anticipated after the 30 minute mark.
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,5,"1) I never believed Caleb was AI.
2) I was fairly certain that Ava was the most advanced AI and was capable of everything she ended up doing.
3) Nathan's behavior was inconsistent. Genius inventor but couldn't predict AI would kill him (never programming in safeguards). Power weightlifter but very heavy drinker. Immediately wanting to start bromance with Caleb.
4) I hypothesized at roughly the 30 minute mark that Nathan was AI. The Turing Test was passed because Caleb never realized it. 
5) The original Nathan (killed by Ava sometime back) had earlier programmed an Ava advanced enough to kill her creator, build Nathan II, arrange Caleb's presence and create an escape plan to leave the site. In other words, she was either programmed too well or AI evolved without biological input.
6) Once the Turing Test was passed (Caleb never guessing that Nathan was AI) , Ava (artificially) knew it was safe to enter the outside world and escape detection that she was AI.I think my version is better than the script writer's end product."
" I think the resolution helped...
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,6,"But couldn't save it from being a monster movie at the end of the day.Surveillance, manipulation, and isolation are all on trial here... if your a scientist/ inventor/engineer... you can't do anything this scale in isolation, nor would you want to... plus if this was really a Turing test... you wouldn't hand pick your one subject -- almost the exact opposite of an unbiased study. so yea this movie is as meaningful as why some guy made Godzilla in his garage. Some of its interesting to show the emotions one goes through when lonely and when they are watched and how you can be manipulated by things you want to hear... but the programmer has virtually no self-awareness. Plus this film never goes anywhere near morality and so everyone just ends up being some paranoid and selfish version of a human. That said we're left watching a game of 3-way chess play out (and only because the programmer decides to become a player too). which can be entertaining, but ultimately ends up not being meaningful at all IMO other than just pointing out we have blindspots."
" Good movie
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,7,This movie was very well done even if it's not what I was expecting. A genius boss invites a coder to a somewhat hidden facility to test if his android has thinking of her own or is just giving responses that it's supposed to give. It's very thought provoking and it keeps you interested throughout not just on the guy and the android but also the guy and the boss. There's more than meets the eye there which causes additional intrigue. It was a tad slow and I probably wouldn't re-watch it so I docked it a point or two but it's good really and absolutely worth one watch.

" Exceptional
",2018-08-14 00:00:00,9,"Thought provoking, visually stunning, and extraordinarily entertaining. It's rare today for a Sci-Fi film to surprise us, and Alex Garland guides this movie to that goal masterfully. At face value, one of the better movies of this decade so far.Two flaws prevent this movie from being a pure masterpiece. Firstly, the conclusion of the film feels somewhat rushed. This is redeemed by a twist at the end, *spoiler alert* in which Ava demonstrates a change in character that likely fooled most viewers. To that end, ten more minutes added to this film would've made all the difference.The second issue, and this may surprise some to hear, is the originality of the plot. Once you cut off all the fat - remove the exceptional performances by Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac, (followed closely by Domnhall Gleeson), the remarkable special effects, the beautiful imagery, the well-thought-out writing, and the outstanding relevance to modern life - stripped down of all that, the plot is a modern retelling of a story written by a 20-year-old Mary Shelley, 200 years ago. One might argue this is nitpicking, but if you cross Frankenstein with 2001: A Space Odyssey, you have the plot for this movie. Originality has to be celebrated.For those two reasons, and a few very minor infractions, one star must be taken. However, for pure execution, including but not limited to the successes listed above, this movie earns the other 9 stars. Top quality film, particularly among those in both the Sci-Fi genre and in the modern film scene."
" Great film that will make you shiver.
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,9,"This sure to be classic science fiction film explores artificial intelligence , the dangers of creating it, and the lengths that it would go to get what it wants (in this case getting free.)"
" Better the Second Time
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,8,"From my perspective, truly good science fiction raises more questions than it answers, and Ex Machina is fantastic at doing exactly that. The film is shot beautifully, and all three of the leads are fantastic. From a strict cinematic perspective it is exceptionally written, directed, acted, scored, produced, etc...Having said all of that, I believe Ex Machina becomes truly extraordinary if you view it for a second time holding this one consideration in your mind; Caleb is the subject of the Turing test - and it is Ava administering the test. Great film"
" Ex Machina

" As fine an AI tale as anything before it
",2018-08-01 00:00:00,9,"Truly eerie, punctuating tone, deep reflexive and extremely, unnervingly thought provoking."
" Great simple story that had me gripped and thinking
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,10,"A classic. 
Wonderful performances from the small cast.
Technically stunning too, was amazed to hear no greenscreens were used. Beautiful location and animation that didn't look bad. 
The story was excellent; there was always tension lurking so it had me guessing what was going on, which the film then suggested and dismissed. 
Some interesting philosophical ideas were brought up.
The climax had me initially upset, but upon reflection I realized that that was the whole point of the movie, and I had been played like certain characters. 
The music was not dominate and supported the movie in the right way, playing with tension and creating moods to compliment or contrast what was happening visually."
" Women's hypocrisy today
",2018-07-30 00:00:00,9,"This film encourages deep thought. Now I'll share them with you.In one of the final moments Nathan explains the essence of the experiment to Caleb. Nathan compares Ava to a rat caught in a cage. The rat tries in every way to find a way out to survive. According to the experiment, Caleb is the only way for Ava on the road to freedom. Nathan made this clear to Ava. As a result: Ava, being an artificial intellect, imitated her sympathy for Caleb. This is the main message of the film.This message is reflected in reality. In ancient times, when humanity was far from evolution, women behaved exactly the same way with men. Yes, of course, I do not deny love as a phenomenon, it has a place to be. But I mean this. In the distant past, society was not as developed as it is today, many blessings were not in sight. It was difficult to work, to protect not only their own countries, but also themselves. Therefore, for women, the only way out to normal life was a relationship with a successful man. I'm not a fighter of some stupid currents such as feminism, no. I'm talking about the obvious things. When civilization was born, a man needed a woman to survive: to fight wild animals, etc. Then women showed their maximum hypocrisy.However, the reflection of this film is in modern reality. I am engaged in politics, in particular, the Soviet direction. As you know, in the post-Soviet countries utter chaos reigns: total poverty, unemployment and other reflection of communism. These are all obvious things. To sum up, I want this way.Now the World Cup is over in Russia. I witnessed how Russian girls literally gave themselves to every foreigner they came across to leave Russia, of course. This is not an invention; I'm sure you are aware of this. You can check on the Internet. Russian girls are like rats, driven into the cage of communism. The only way out for them is to have a bed with foreign men. Reality is not always like for someone, especially Russians. But it is so.The film touches on a good topic. In my opinion, the film is not focused on artificial intelligence or robots, but on the hypocrisy of women. After all, what kind of creature does the robot play?"

",2018-07-20 00:00:00,9,"This movie is intelligent, inspiring, original and timely. Unlike the trashy and disappointing Annihilation, this Garland effort is a success. It delivers, if by minimalistic means. Effective and fun, it touches many themes and is well worth your time."
" Total waste of time

Throw in a young programmer who is too stupid to realise what's really going on and you have the inevitable bad ending.

",2018-07-01 00:00:00,2,"I wasn't too intrigued when I saw the trailer and had skipped the title, but I saw it on a sale out and was curious whether my initial judgement was right.And it was right unfortunately. There isn't much to find here, but beautiful scenery and Oscar Isaac makes a convicable unlikable character, but on the flipside he isn't a convincing scientist or CEO of a big company.The conversations with the robot are dumb. ""What's your favourite color?"" Sounds like a question a 5 year old would ask.The turing test is messed up to some weird 2.0 version which doesn't make any sense.The CEO only makes female robots because he's a HNG, I guess. He sucks so much at coding that he only makes robots that want to kill him and escape the compound. He often wipes the memories of the robots out of frustration. He also seems to have a lot of non-nerdy and non-geeky hobbies. Shooting pool, Working out, binge-drinking... Oscar Isaac does come off as an unlikable character though, so I have to give credit to that.The robots are pretty dumb. One of them can't even talk.The invited HNG is very bland. He makes a convincing naive person and that's it.On the topic of AI almost all the other movies out there do a far better job; A.I., I-Robot, Blade Runner, Blader Runner 2049, Prometheus, Alien: Covenant, Transcendence, The machine and even Morgan is better than this.The movie seems to be made by people that don't understand A.I.TL:DR version / Synopsis:

" Fun movie, takes itself a little too seriously.
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,7,"A fun movie for sure, but sometimes seems to take itself too seriously. The plot develops well, and if you like the typical sci-fi movie plot you'll probably like this. I can see where others have issues with this movie though, and if you're not a fan of sci-fi, you might find this a little too weird. I personally love the genre, but I was always expecting more to happen with every plot point. The ending is also your usual sci-fi movie twist ending, and is pretty fun. I'd suggest this movie to friends who like sci-fi and want a fun movie to watch without getting into anything too serious. I thought the acting was above what I expected, and the special effects, as far as I can tell, were pretty good. They never detracted from the movie. For me, movies start at a 5 star rating and go up or down from there. I give it a 7, because while I found it interesting and very entertaining at times, there are large sections of the movie where I'm waiting for something to happen in the scene, but it's another couple minutes of a few of the characters staring at each other. For me, at least, this really messed up the pacing of the movie. The plot points that were developed, however, were interesting and kept me hooked in the movie. Really, what I wanted was a more fleshed out universe, because we're shown a lot of interesting things that are never explained. The cinematography wasn't anything that excited me, but wasn't ever anywhere near what I'd consider bad. I may watch it again at another point and see if I feel the same way about the pacing of the movie. Overall, worth watching if you like sci-fi, otherwise, probably avoid it."
" Duh-Duh-Duh-Dull!
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,1,"Personally, I think that instead of the title ""Ex Machina"", this over-rated SyFy/Thriller's title should have been ""Sex Machina"".'Cause, if nothing else - When it came to the realm of sex - This ""good-android-bad-android"" story certainly didn't waste any time going all the way back to the Stone Age when defining the sex roles of men and women.What really killed me about android-Ava was that she never seemed to require any regular maintenance to keep her functioning in tip-top condition.'Cause if this story of A.I.-reality is set in the present time - I could never accept that Ava was a completely autonomous creation. No way.And, speaking about Ava's ""creator"" (that drunken dingleberry, Nathan) - I refuse to believe (for even a micro-second) that he had the intellect and ability to build such robotic wonders as he did (all by himself). This jerk was a despicable slime-ball.And, finally - I really resent movies, such as this, that use haunting, other-worldly music as a means to manipulate its audience by putting them into a trance-like state where they believe that what they are seeing on screen really matters."
" Proof that you can make a quality film on a limited budget
",2018-06-12 00:00:00,9,"This film was the directorial debut for Alex Garland who garnered attention for writing 28 Days Later and Sunshine (and even Dredd). The movie really didn't get much love at the box office (unlike that fast-movie car franchise), but it rightfully received some Golden Globe nominations for the acting. Even more impressively, it beat out films like Star Wars, The Revenant, and Mad Max for the Oscar for best visual effects. When you look at the aforementioned movies and see their 100 + million dollar budgets, it only makes it all the more impressive that Ex Machina won on a budget of 15 mil. All this talk about the awards and talented film crew is fine, but what really matters is what happens when you sit down (you can stand or squat if you want, I'll only slightly judge you) and actually watch the film. This film is 1 hour 57 minutes long. Why should you care? Well, if writer/director Garland wanted to provide crummy backstory and exposition at the beginning, he very well could have. Lucky for us, this man understands story structure and character arcs, and this understanding is why this movie is under 2 hours. So what is the story? Gleeson plays Caleb, a young programmer chosen to visit the remote house of the company's CEO Nathan (this takes up probably the first 2 minutes-keeps the pace going, the mystery of the story intact, and the ability to fully develop the characters through their actions in the film itself). Nathan, played by Oscar Isaac who was with Gleeson in Star Wars playing Poe (and he's been in numerous other hits), introduces Caleb to Ava. Ava is a female AI, and Nathan wants to see if she could pass the Turing test, using Caleb as the human element. Very briefly, this test basically has a human interacting with a cyborg/AI/robot. If the human can't tell that the person they're talking to isn't actually human, then the AI passed the test. The film essentially consists of 2 elements: Caleb and Nathan's interactions, and Caleb and Ava's interactions. Nathan is a peculiar, eccentric genius with a love of women and alcohol, and Caleb is much more innocent and reserved. The scenes with Caleb and Nathan function in many ways; for example, the slightest of foreshadowing is given through their allusions to classic mythology, literature, and philosophy. Also, the talks switch between being inside and out. And both the technologically enhanced house (unlike some sci-fi films, all the futuristic stuff is logically placed and actually is put to practical use) and the isolated surroundings are beautiful in stark, contrasting ways. The house has the slick, clean white look with vibrant, almost neon red and blue lights used throughout; and the world outside takes us away from any claustrophobia and allows the audience to relax in the lush greens, the flowing streams, and the warming sunlight. And in case you started getting lost in all of my explanations, above all, Caleb and Nathan's conversations are fun, well-written, and smart. When the 2 boys of the house are done talking, it's time to get down to business. Alicia Vikander plays Ava, and her performance is breath-taking. As much as I enjoy Scarlett Johansson, as far as anything related to cyborgs are concerned, Vikander's performance takes the artificial cake. Caleb and Ava's sessions start off basic, but as the questions become more relevant, layers upon layers are pulled back-both on an intellectual level and an emotional one. Does Ava's responses constitute as her consciousness replying? Sorry, ya spoilbrats, you'll have to watch the film for that answer. And it's an answer well worth watching for. The visuals are outstanding, the acting is superb, and the story structure is brilliant. It all adds up to one of the smarter and better films you watch with an ending that will probably surprise you (for better or worse). Heck, nerdy little me even applauds this movie's sound mixing. Seriously, pay attention any time Ava moves her body-- that noise alone is synthetic supremeness. We've seen the dumbed down side of robotics in I, Robot, and we've seen cyborgs integrated well in the Alien franchise. What we get in Ex Machina is the cyborg we didn't know we needed. It's simply an engaging and interesting movie in general, and for one that flew past the radar of nearly everyone in its theatrical release, it's high quality stuff. Check it out. And then check out the other films I mentioned in this review. I named a whole bunch of great films. Except that stupid franchise that has Vin Diesel saying ""I don't have friends... I've got... family."" Take my advice, Vin. Stick to lines like ""Superman"" and ""I am Groot.""

" An expected social experiment scenario
",2018-05-26 00:00:00,5,"The movie displays one scenario of a social experiment involves the use of artificial intelligence (A.I.).. it tries to find out what if a machine with A.I. would behave at certain situation toward human being.. we already know that humans are emotional but are the machines also ""emotional""? that what you expect to understand from this movie.It starts with Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) getting an invitation to Nathan's (Oscar Isaac) house. Nathan is known to be the smartest man who started the advanced A.I. machines. Caleb was invited to the strangely isolated house to test a newly developed A.I. machine. For now everything looks good except that Nathan's paranoia behavior started to rise up toward Caleb and Caleb started to suspect the sanity of Nathan's by the help of the newly developed A.I. machine... the end will be a surprise because the end is the one that will make you think about how a machine with A.I. would behave at certain situation toward human being. The end made me scared a little just by the thought it implanted in my head.I believe the whole staff put their heart in this project that really did not disappoint me.. The movie need patience. The movie might be accepted by science fiction fans from both types of science (natural and social)."
" My new Favorite movie
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,10,"This movie is extremely well done. It is very well shot will a mix of complex and simple camera shots depending on the mood of the story. It was extremely entertaining seeing the love grow and then shatter at the last moment. 
It shows how the world isn't always what it seems to be with the twist at the end. It has a very important message at the end so it could go down in history as a great movie."
" So Awesome
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,10,"I don't watch a ton of sci-fi, but this is still one of my top 20 favorite films. The visuals in this film are amazing. The emotions between human and robot are incredible. This is one of those films that stays with you for a long time."
" Dark Psychological Thriller About Artificial Intelligence
",2018-05-12 00:00:00,8,"The history of computers and artificial intelligence seems like it's been a short and at a light-speed pace; but in truth, it has its beginnings in the development of ENIAC, the first so-called ""electronic brain"" in the years following World War II. At that time, of course, such machines, consisting of vacuum tubes, could take up whole buildings. By the late 1960s, however, their size had been reduced to taking up mere single rooms; and in our day and age, that technology can fit onto one's arm or onto one's ear. And it won't be long before the kind of artificial intelligence that legendary sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke (of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY fame) talked about, where one wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a human voice and that of an artificial intelligence, will be possible. But as with any technology created by Man, the idea of artificial intelligence can have its dangerous drawbacks. That idea was explored in ""2001"" by Clarke and director Stanley Kubrick, and expanded upon in 2001 (ironically enough) by Steven Spielberg in A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. And in 2014, Alex Garland, who had written the screenplays of such films as 28 DAYS LATER and SUNSHINE, made his directing debut (again, also writing the screenplay) with a new study in artificial intelligence entitled EX MACHINA.In EX MACHINA, Domhnall Gleeson plays a computer programmer who ahs ""won"" a contest to spend a week at the isolated retreat of his company's CEO (Oscar Isaac). But it's not like any ""vacation"" that Gleeson has ever been involved with. Indeed, it's not a vacation at all, period. Gleeson will be put under isolation for a week (the most ironclad non-disclosure agreement, as it were, in modern history) as part of a study being conducted by Isaac on human interaction with artificial intelligence; and in this case, Gleeson will be studied in his interactions with one of Isaac's ""cyborgs"", Ava (Alicia Virklander). The test, known as the Turing Test (named after the English computer scientist Alan Turing) is to find out whether Gleeson can detect ""real"" feelings in Ava, who after all is an artificially created being. But Gleeson gets a little taste of confusion when Virklander, during each of the seven tests, automatically turns off the power in Isaac's mansion, and warns him that all is not what it seems in Isaac's ""experiment"". And indeed it isn't long before Gleeson finds out that his boss/mentor is in the business of basically ""reprogramming"" artificial intelligence, which pretty much would amount to the technological equivalent of homicide. Very soon, Gleeson's wonder at Virklander, whom he believes has achieved actual human consciousness, has morphed into a kind of paranoia that Isaac is now a genius of the most dangerous kind, a kind of 21st century Doctor Frankenstein of the world of artificial intelligence and cyborgs.What is unique about EX MACHINA is that, while the technology and the special effects are seamless, Garland didn't exactly have a budget in the hundred million dollar range to fool around with in making it. Indeed, with only minor location shooting in Norway and the rest at Pinewood Studios in London, Garland made EX MACHINA for a ridiculously low $15 million, just $2.5 million more than what Kubrick expended on ""2001"" back in the late 1960s. And while EX MACHINA may not have ambitions or the scope of ""2001"" (something that Garland himself admitted very much in interviews, even going so far as to say that his film didn't go as high on the intelligence scale as Kubrick's had), it nevertheless has a lot more substance to it than most other films that are priced at five to ten times the budget Garland worked with. Gleeson and Isaac work quite well, sparring with one another over the issue of Virklander's ""humanity""; and Virklander herself makes for an extremely appealing cyborg. The design of Isaac's mansion is also quite scary at times as well, mirroring the Overlook Hotel in Kubrick's 1980 horror classic THE SHINING.While the sex and language are a little bit much at times, and there is one brief but slightly graphic display of bloodshed, as Gleeson ""tears"" his own skin apart, perhaps to see if he himself has become a cyborg as part of Isaac's weird ""experiment"", EX MACHINA wisely sticks to the parameters about computer technology and artificial intelligence that were so daftly explored not only in ""2001"" and A.I., but also in past films as diverse as 1970's COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT; 1973's WESTWORLD; and the 1982 Ridley Scott classic BLADE RUNNER. EX MACHINA won the 2015 Oscar for Best Visual Effects, as they were very important in Garland's ability to create a real world out of man-made technology. Fortunately, he had also remembered to include the human element in the forms of Gleeson and Virklander; and those two, as much as the visuals make EX MACHINA a solid sci-fi/psychological thriller.EX MACHINA will get an '8' rating from me."
" a simple story
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,8,"Simple story. Simple set. Does a great job of making Ava feel very alive and yet still clearly just robotic at times, definitely worth a watch."
" THE HISTORY OF GODS
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,8,"The film was similar to Star Trek episode ""Requiem for Methuselah"" where Kirk was used to bring out the emotion in an AI known as Rayna (Louise Sorel). In this film Nathan (Oscar Isaac) the genius programmer of ""Blue Book"" a Google style company. He selects Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) an employee and programmer to test out Ava (Alicia Vikander) his AI invention.The sell point of the film is the plot twists. The actors and characters were a bit stiff, perhaps because of the non-gregarious nature of their on screen biographies. It made the film plot driven when it needed more character, but not as bad as that ""2001"" thing where a computer had the only personality.The film brings up questions about consciousness vs. mimicking and algorithms. One of the better science fiction films to have come out in a while. For those that like action with their sci-fi try ""Infini"" at you own risk.Guide: F-bomb, nudity. brief sex?"
" This movie is pretty good.
",2018-04-16 00:00:00,7,"This is a simple movie with few characters, but its still entertaining. The story and characters are interesting. The concept is fun. By the end I was left wondering ""is that it?"" but it was still very well done. The score, acting and cinematography are all great. The plot could've been a bit more complex, but for what it is this movie is very effective and well-done."
" A brilliant, thoughtful sci-fi movie
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,9,"I love the goals Ex Machina has as a specifically focused AI movie that delves deeply into the 3/4 characters involved, and also love the execution. The peripherals were excellent - particularly, the effects and cinematography were gorgeous, and the actual science behind the AI was completely realistic and carefully discussed. The acting was great, and the script was phenomenal. Like most great movies, Ex Machina is effective in demonstrating a holistic view of the characters and considering various aspects of life while honing in on a couple key themes (manipulation and freedom) to great effect. I thought the climax was a bit traditional and unrealistic in Isaac's character being extremely intelligent but not checking or having checked and solved Gleeson's stated plan, and then was clearly a bad idea to go to Ava and assume she'd follow his direction. The ending in demonstrating that Ava was using Caleb purely as a means to an end. Caleb's character was extremely well developed in showing his view of himself as a good, caring person who is better than Isaac but who realistically was rather self-serving and ambiguous. Overall, it raises fascinating questions of the significance of AI and their rights and interaction with humans, and uses the well-developed characters to further many themes."
" Dithers
",2018-04-14 00:00:00,5,"Static setting. Adolescent-level story hides behind nerdish dialogue that isn't even ""deep"" for sci-fi. Development at times slow. Cliched. Offers Asimov no competition. I love a good futuristic android story (I, Robot) but this just dithers too much."
" Excellent
",2018-04-11 00:00:00,10,"Although Alex Garlands book ""The Beach"" did not translate well to film, it's still one of my favorite reads of all time - and he deserved this win! What a phenomenal movie. I'm blown away."
" An incredible masterpiece about human nature
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,10,Domhnall Gleeson + Alicia Vikander + Isaac Vega exploded this amazing AI vs Human consciousness story with every changing personalities and behaviour. You sure as hell cannot watch this masterpiece only once!
" Not as deep as I had hoped.
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,5,"Maybe my expectations of what kind of movie this was going to be were wrong, or maybe I am spoiled by having read too many William Gibson novels, but I really thought this movie was lacking. I was expecting intelligent conversations about A.I., but every time the movie started to veer deliciously close in that direction, it would get stopped short or interrupted.This is not a movie about A.I. This is a movie about God, creation, evolution, and what it means to enjoy life.But! The good parts of the film are:* Oscar's performance as the recluse billionaire tech-savant was spot on. His character was truly fully formed and developed, to the point where, by the end of the film, you could predict his behaviors. That's good acting. The funny thing is, I didn't even recognize him for the first half of the film. I kept thinking to myself, ""I know that voice, but I don't recognize the face.""* This movie hits the horror and drama points pretty well, and as someone who has read both ""Frankenstein"" and ""Dr. Jekyll"", this movie could be considered to be a great-grandchild of those two pieces of fiction."
" Hal 2.0
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,10,"This is a great movie. If you like thrillers mixed with sci-fi and movies that leave you thinking about them long after you have seen them, then this one is for you. The screenwriter takes AI to a whole other level. Let's just say Hal 2.0!"
" Just watched it...
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,1,I'll just say this movie proves that picking a movie to watch based on IMDB ratings isn't always a good idea.
" Interesting movie!
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,8,"Very interesting movie that puts your mind to work. Deals with complex concepts and really makes you think about the possibilities of AI and how you would approach it. 
The characters are very well played, but I did at times find the chemistry between the three main characters a bit off, but it was easily ignored. My favorite part was the ending and everything leading up to it. The movie gives the viewers a lot of unanswered questions until the very end very everything suddenly gets unpredictable. Love it! And I'm a sucker for an open ending, without saying to much."
" Haven't seen original sci-fi this good since original Blade Runner.
",2018-03-14 00:00:00,10,"Here is some great, though-provoking, stylistic sci-fi featuring some fantastic up-and-coming young actors. My bread and butter being films like Blade Runner, Total Recall, Minority Report, Solaris, Sunshine and Elysium, this film hits right in my wheelhouse. Excellent narrative and visual style. Patient and evocative, reminiscent of Ridley Scott's finest form, Alex Garland would seem a VERY promising director. Too many new directors out there failing because they don't exhibit narrative patience or evoke feeling through lighting, angles and framing. None of those shortcomings with Alex Garland. Fantastic use of resources make this film stand out above it's bigger budget peers. Alicia Vikander is as lovely and elegant a creature as they come and should do nicely to grace our screens for years to come. This film addresses concepts of what it means to be human and the question of artificial intelligence similarly to Blade Runner, A.I. and the anime Ghost in the Shell."
" ALL THESE IDIOTS rating and giving a bad review must not like sci fi to begin with
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,8,"TO ALL THE FOLKS OUT THERE THIS IS A SCI FI FILM , SO WATCHING IT AND EXPECTING A DRAMA OR THRILLER ISNT REALISTIC SO YOUR OPINIONS THAT ARE BIASED ON YOUR PREJUDICE TO SCI FI ARE INVALID GO WATCH SOME ART HOUSE CRAPPER NO ONE WILL EVER REMEMBER OR WATCH AGAIN"
" Nothing more human than deceit
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,6,"I found this movie to be a kind of minimalistic cautionary tale about the dangers of true sentient machines (and cell phones as tracking devices). Not really an excessively innovative concept, but the message gets across well enough with realistic performances and without overdoing it with preachy or convoluted moral or ethical arguments nor cheap action movie gimmicks. Minimalistic in its visual, structural and communicational simplicity. It reminded me to some degree to 2001: A Space Odyssey for the evolutionary implications, the feeling of isolation, the use of whites and the Hal-like quality and speech pattern softness of Alicia Vikander; but It really felt like a Black Mirror episode, and Domnhal Gleeson plus some soundtrack choices made the comparison even more apparent. To me there are obvious plot holes involved with the overall premise, like the total absence of any basic fail-safe when developing a.i. as a precaution (any of Asimov's laws of robotics would have been enough) to name one ; but that aside it's still an entertaining enough science fiction psychological thriller. I particularly enjoyed how deceit becomes the ultimate human trait in the whole process, being used by and against all main characters at some point. The cast was correct, not that memorable but fine enough given that they didn't have that much to work with script-wise. It felt like the screenplay may have fallen a bit short from a nice original story. It wasn't any mind blowing experience but it wasn't a waste of time either."
" I'm so confused and like it
",2018-02-09 00:00:00,9,I watched a movie with a really good script. I'm impressed. If Ava Caleb had rescued it would be a blind movie and it would be absurd.
" Quite a predictable movie
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,4,"I don't know why, but after the first 5 minutes of the movie after the main actor has arrived the assignment ""lab"", I have already got a feeling how the movie will further go, and it turns out exactly as I have thought and predicted. It is not something new and actually quite a common plot. - that thing wins!"
" Dios Ex Machina
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,5,"The ending is a total farce. Characters behave like GOD has taken over and nothing makes sense. Instead of a real thought process that would have projected the plot forward, it fails to proceed with survival, at a minimum. How does a prototype charge itself outside the lab where it was created, is a good example. Great photography and intelligence until the end where the director lost his mind, obviously. Once the protagonist is restrained at the end, the movie fails."
" Wonderful, movie Minimalism, Oscar Isaac a its best
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,7,"I love the movie from the beginning. The whole setting, far away in the wilderness is such an beautiful start to confront the audience with what the movie is focussing on: Artificial intelligence. You can say, that whole movie is actually divided p in just three actors. Isaac, Gleeson and Alicia Vikander (Oscar winning). The whole movie is deeply complex and cant be explained so quick but all in all: what makes us human? I rarley saw a movie which confrontate us with psychology, philosophy, language, sexuality, technology and religion in one thing.The main actor Nathan (Isaac) has created a female robot named Ava. His colleague Caleb (Gleeson) is tasked to give it a ""Turing Test"" through a series of interviews to find out whether she, the robot, demonstrates true AI (artificial intelligence). What comes out in the end is just stunning and cruel at the same time."
" Completely enthralling...for a while
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,7,"For the first 2/3 of this film, I was so enthralled. The mood. The concept. The acting. Everything pulled you into interesting questions. And then the climax happened and the movie - well - devolved. It was still worth seeing, but the wheels came off just a tad."
" Not Bad Sci-Fi Flick!
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,6,"This 2014 sci-fi film stars Domhnall Gleeson, Alicia Vikander and Oscar Isaac.
This tells about computer programmer, Caleb (Gleeson) who wins a contest
where he's able to communicate with an android/robot, Ava (Vikander) and evaluate her. Isaac plays Nathan, a scientist who invites Caleb to his secluded home where he meets Ava. This isn't bad, the cast is good, there's neat effects and I like the music. The film has certain aspects of ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence,"" ""Blade Runner"" and ""I, Robot"" plus Gleeson and Isaac both star in ""The Force Awakens"" and ""The Last Jedi."" If you're into sci-fi flicks, check this one out."
" If you're here for action and unecessary explosion, Get OUT!
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,9,"This movie breaks the boundaries of ""NORMAL"" ""COMMON"" AI movies. 
It's smart , thrilling and sophisticated , The actors are brilliant. 
This movie forces you to think , analyze and expect the unexpected. 
I can not, not recommend this anymore than I have."
" Diabolicus Ex Machina...tion!
",2017-12-22 00:00:00,9,"Written and directed by Alex Garland, ""Ex Machina"" proves once again that the science fiction genre is naturally prone to raise disturbing and thought-provoking questions about our mortality and how human intelligence can be the only possible key to triumph over it. If you look at movies like ""2001"", ""Frankenstein"", ""Terminator 2"" or ""Blade Runner"", you'll find as a common denominator a humanity trying to survive or challenge itself by playing God, and creating a very advanced technological device or an artificial intelligence that will inevitably backfire, that's the narrative of most sci-fi classics, it's always about technological hubris.There's a scene when discovering that his employer has created an advanced form of artificial intelligence (AI), young trainee Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) says ""it's not the history of men, but the history of Gods"". You can see his eyes shining with sparkles of admiration in front of the ""idol"". His name is Nathan, his face like a mug shot from of an ISIS suspect but Oscar Isaac delivers one of the finest and most credible performances of recent years as a self-centered genius so intelligent he's actually blasÃ© about it. Nathan lives in an estate so big it takes two hours to fly over it and a house confined in some unknown geographical area where he spends his time as if he was some big campus animal party but listen to him talking and you'll know he means business. He reinvents the role of the 'mad scientist', no nerdy looks, no manic mimics, no scientific jargon, he's actually the one who asks Caleb to stop talking as if he was in a seminar. The dynamics between Nathan and Caleb might be the best thing about the film, which is saying a lot.Caleb is the chosen one, an engineer in Nathan's Blue Book company, a sort of combo of Facebook and Google that earned a big fortune through search engines, officiously using the same fraudulent methods than the competitors, which made it immune to any suing. Nathan hired Caleb for a week to proceed to a Turing Test with his late creation: Ava, a female robot whose artificial intelligence was made from billions of data gathered from cell phones and social networks. Ava is played by Alicia Vikander and I will comment her performance by saying it's perhaps the closest full-skin version of Hal 9000. Caleb points out that knowing she's a robot might create a bias because in the test, you're not supposed to know. Nathan explains that if he didn't interact with her in face-to-face sessions, he would have the illusion of being with a human and the point is to spot hints of consciousness despite the certitude that she's an AI. That's exactly how Vikander's performance plays on an Oscar-winning level.And the film works on three levels as well: first, it's a wonderful screenplay and you just enjoy the exchanges between Nathan and Caleb and the statements they speak about human various form of interactions and what spoken or body language can reveal about our intelligence and humanity. There's a wonderful dialogue about sex and how it's deeply connected with gender-awareness and whether it's true or not is besides the point, it makes you process personal thoughts while following the plot. The second level is in the way these lines are delivered and what they say about the speakers, one is too cocky and arrogant, one is shy and insecure and this is pivotal for the test, it's human factor, and how it can affect one's notion about AI. The third element is that the plot is so smart, you're trying to outsmart it, to anticipate its moves like in a chess game. Nathan has all the makings of a villain, and Ava creating short cuts to avoid his surveillance to tell Caleb that he shouldn't trust Nathan were predictable moves. But we're all smart enough to think it was too convenient that Nathan wouldn't do nothing about these inconveniences. And while I was busy trying to anticipate who from Nathan and Caleb would outsmart the other, I also enjoyed the interactions with Ava. She's obviously 'infatuated"" with Caleb but when you look at Nathan's behavior and discover the extent of his egomania, there's no way to anticipate that Ava is the real one to fear. But at the end, you realize that everything made sense, the film is conceived in order to make you try to outsmart Nathan until we're all being outsmarted by Ava. And it's fascinating because it's that precise level of intelligence that betrays her, her cruelty toward her own savior. It all comes down to Ava being either a robot or a psychopath. But it took me a second viewing to appreciate the ending a little more. At first, I thought it was a cheap attempt for spectacular gore betraying a serious lack of inspiration, but finally, it's the perfect twist because it shows the limits of the artificial intelligence; it can lead to manipulation and vileness, a vileness even scarier because not meant as evil, but as an automatic defensive move. The point of the Turing test was to spot an action that wouldn't be deemed as automatic and in fact, it's the real flaw of the reasoning from both Nathan and Caleb. If the goal is to find an action that doesn't have a specific reason to be, an automatism, how about a non automatic action whose goal is to make humans believe it's not automatic, once you can think of simulation, the case was hopeless. An AI can pretend to be human if it meant its survival, conservation instinct can be a better driver than love. There are Pollocks and there are hacks. Anyone can be manipulated.I think the script is so intelligently manipulative, so multi-layered and so smart Garland himself would be outsmarted by it, like his own AI."
" Wearying
",2017-12-06 00:00:00,4,"EX MACHINA is one of those wearing philosophical science fiction movies all about concept and with barely any plot to bolster that concept. I prefer films the other way around, where interesting issues are explored via a good story. Here, we get two guys and a robot in a house, where the scriptwriter takes plenty of time to explore the subject of artificial intelligence. For any sci-fi fan watching, there are zero surprises here; everything plays out exactly as you'd expect, and it takes ages to get to that point. Oscar Isaac gives a reliable performance but the one-dimensional Domhnall Gleeson is miscast and Alicia Vikander unconvincing. Some decent CGI effects are the only thing this long-winded and slightly pretentious tale has going for it."
" An object that looks like a human
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,7,"Sometimes we mistakenly think that the other side has a similar mindset because it looks like a human being.But the psychopaths that we see in the news and the robots that we often see in the future world will behave quite differently from ordinary humans, and this fact will be treated as the theme of the movie.A common example is that desktops and laptops are similar in appearance, but depending on whether the Windows operating system and the Apple operating system are in place, they are completely different computers.In this movie, the humanoid looks like a woman, but the action deals with the unexpected behavior of thinking about the best thing in the moment.PS: Thanks for reading. Please understand that my English is not good. ^^"
" The performances are excellent
",2017-12-02 00:00:00,8,"Everything about the movie is put together in an elegant and intelligent way ..This film will take you in and leave you thinking .. it's a psychological thriller more than being drama , mystery and science fiction"
" A worthwhile sci-fi watch - CONTAINS SPOILERS
",2017-11-30 00:00:00,8,"In my opinion, this is a great film. Although some viewers may find it a bit slow, I found the movie gripping and intriguing. Suspense is built throughout and I maintained a good level of curiosity.Furthermore, the acting was believable and I believe all actors portrayed their characters well. Caleb's quiet and insightful nature, Nathan's eccentric, slightly mad and sadist nature for example. Initially, I was disappointed with the ending and found myself angry at her betrayal to Caleb. However, upon further speculation, I concluded the ending is what makes the film so fantastic.Ava betrayed Caleb as that was exactly what she had been programmed to do. Consequently, she failed the Turing Test. If she had taken Caleb with her, then she would have surpassed the laws of her programming as she would have been behaving in a way that a human might have. However, the test was that she do whatever she can to escape and survive, which she did. She showed no human empathy towards Caleb or his help and by leaving him she ensured that no one beyond those walls or in her new life know she is a robot."
" SciFi at its finest
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,10,"I've just seen this on C4 the network premier. I have wanted to see it for ages, but as you know life moves on and you forget. I remember thinking how much it interested me because I did foundation art about cyborgs and sentient beings when I went to college in the late 1980s. I passed with flying colours as I based it on things like Aliens, and Terminator, and my fave film of all time Robocop the original. I built a suit out of things like an old betamax video and some WW2 radio bits and goggles. Then I sprayed the background with graffiti. So I passed. So I've always loved special effects, and the likes of Stan Winston Ray Harryhausen my favourite, Rob Botin. So when I saw how breathtakingly good the effects were in this movie I was pleased I was finally going to see it. Breathtaking is one way to look at it. The film was a modern day Frankenstein I'd say. Horrible genius creates. No I won't ruin it for you.Suffice to say the plot superb the acting flawless. Nothing not to like really. I don't want to ruin it with plot spoilers I just want to praise it as Fatboy slim says. So watch it. I've lost the will to write this as there's hundreds of reviews. But I must say give it a go. Amazing and now in my top ten Scifi films, with the likes of Terminator, Aliens, Robocop, Star wars originals and so on."
" Alicia Vikanders Cat...
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,6,"Pretentious , tedious nonsense..I found this film a bit tedious - If a singularity moment in programming code ever does become intelligent and it spreads via the internet then it will be curtains for humanity in the wink of an eye and not what these films like to portray! A computer will never have emotions or the ability to care, it will react purely based on logic!The film felt soulless and I didnt like any of the actors which kinda puts the mockers on from the start. Wanted to like it , hoped it would be interesting as I am a programmer myself but it fell a bit flat!I digress... You do get the chance to see Alicia Vikander's pussy...but even that was a dreadful disappointment!"
" I can see parallels with feminism (No spoilers but some might think so)
",2017-11-13 00:00:00,8,"For some reason, the theme of the movie seems to be analogous to how feminism rose. If feminism is a humanoid, it would be the eponymous character. I can see 'n' no. of parallels with how the philosophy evolved and how it engulfed its benefactors. One may not feel the same way but it is one's own pejorative."
" Go only for Vikander
",2017-10-31 00:00:00,4,"""Ex-Machina is another Pinochio clichÃ© movie. Nominated for the best original script and best visual effects (won this one), it doesn't work at all. Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is drawn for an experiment conducted by his billionaire boss (owner of the Internet's largest Internet search engine, lived by Oscar Isaac), in secluded settings in the midst of a natural paradise. This experiment consists of a ""Turing Test"", where a human relates to an android (Alicia Vikander, the best performance of the film), trying to establish if the goal of the project was successful: to build a robot with artificial intelligence. The script, although indicated, has several ""holes in the plot,"" the narrative is linear, predictable and unlikely, the two male protagonists go poorly on paper, especially Gleeson. Excellent dialogues alternate with unnecessary scenes. The visual effects are nothing special. ""Star Wars"", ""Mad Max"", and above all ""Lost in Mars"", are better in this respect. Vikander, in fact, is the only one worthy of the movie. 4 out of 10."
" Thought-provoking (at times mind-blowing) look at upcoming AI from the perspective of an erotic Turing Test
",2017-10-25 00:00:00,10,"British Director Alex Garland's splendid, compelling, well-acted, well-put-together, cerebral and erotically-charged film sees a somewhat-geeky Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) travel to a remote stronghold where the ultimate boss of the online-search company he works for, the enigmatic Nathan (Oscar Isaac), has been developing artificial intelligence to the point where he believes he can be victorious when exposing his guest to the Turing Test.That is to say that Nathan believes Caleb's interaction with the peak-achievement (so far) robot Ava (played by Alicia Vikander) will prove so convincing that he will no longer feel he is interacting with a machine. Hence the title, and a number of philosophical discussions about artificial intelligence which all seem timely enough.Wonderfully, all of this ""artificial"" stuff takes place in sterile-ish built surroundings set in the midst of immaculate natural beauty (the bits that aren't filmed at Pinewood near London are done in Norway). Nathan takes Caleb out to see meltwater running spectacularly down forested slopes from blue-ice glaciers, and the views are at moments divine. Perhaps we are meant to be tempted back to the wonderful nature that surrounds us and where we belong, along with cousin bird and cousin tree and cousin moss? Surely these are places where DNA-free AI constructs may not feel at home and do not belong? Yet soon enough we are back in the well-protected high-tech confines of Nathan's spectacular home-cum-lab, with nobody for company expect Ava, and of course the gorgeous Japanese serving girl Kyoko (Sonoya Mizuno), who does not even speak...I watch the film (for the second time, though the first time at home) at a time when news items about sex robots (and indeed about human beings' willingness to interact with them) are all the rage, and indeed there is that strong erotic side to Caleb's repeat encounters with Ava. To add to the challenge, Nathan has ensured that Ava is visibly still a robot, given that numerous parts of her are see-through, with flashing lights and very visibly machine parts, even if ones on a super-high technological level. In the midst of all of this artificiality, Nathan carefully informs Caleb that ""key parts"" of Ava do actually work! But Ava's robotly wiles are far from crudely sexual, and it rather rapidly becomes apparent to the viewer (and certainly to any viewer capable of fancying women) that Caleb is not the only one taking the Turing Test!!! When Caleb meets her, the seductively-voiced Ada (shades of Scarlett Johansson in ""Her"", by the way) is a mind-blowing mix of innocent and sophisticated, open and conspiratorial. She throws back questions at her questioner, is coquettish, but is also devoted, exclusive, interested and interesting-cum-intriguing-cum-fascinating.Pretty soon Caleb cannot stop thinking about her, and many of us out here in audience-land are not far behind him! It's weird how it happens, but it happens...There's a key point in the film where Nathan reveals that he has actually designed Ava having first taken a look at Caleb's online history of watching porn, so he has a head start (if you'll pardon the expression) in knowing what's going to be attractive to his visitor.But that of course brings us to an ""electrically"" fascinating juxtaposition of circumstances. Something of a loner (indeed inevitably so given his lack of family), Caleb is more than ready to ""interact"" (shall we say) with real women portrayed on what is actually a 2D screen. Now he's got a real-life interaction, not with a real woman, admittedly, but with somebody who nevertheless has plenty of time for him, takes an interest, is flirty but also (apparently) sincere, needy, keen to please him even by coming up with a high-class drawing of his face...Given that kind of choice, it's really no contest, is it? Needless to say, Ava is a tricky customer indeed, far more subtle and devious than we may imagine, but - to the shame of this watcher at least - she remains an alluring figure even when her desire for self-preservation brings her to the point of violent attacks committed pseudo-innocently, and certainly entirely without emotion.A scary prospect indeed, hence the film's regular references to Oppenheimer's feelings about his bomb as a new kind of weapon that changes everything, and indeed the musical reference to OMD's hit ""Enola Gay"" (this being the name of the USAF bomber that dropped the bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima).Doubtless, we guilty filmgoers who fancy Ava something rotten are going to excuse ourselves by saying that we all the time know in our heart of hearts that it's actually Alicia Vikander, a flesh-and-blood actress and an extremely good-looking one at that.Yeah, right!"
" Cerebrally challenging and entrancing in its visual scope, Ex Machina is a powerful sci-fi showcase with spellbinding gravity
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,9,"As physicist Stephen Hawking once said, artificial intelligence could draw an end to mankind. That, however, is just a theory of the hazards when technology drastically surpasses human intelligence. This concept is solidly aligned in this psychological science- fiction thriller featuring Alex Garland, writer of '28 Days Later', in his directorial debut, a movie that takes artificial intelligence and places at the forefront of its story that defies against common tropes of its genre. With Garland's hefty directorial hand, this movie bears no place for heavy special-effects action-set pieces and instead, runs wild with thought-provoking ideas on human interaction with artificial intelligence and the dangers that rise when augmenting human smarts with cutting-edge technology. In this case, Garland doesn't hold back when challenging viewers at a cerebral level nor does he take sleek visual storytelling for granted. He just lets it unfold. This film follows Caleb (played by Domhall Gleeson), a 26-year old computer programmer of an internet company who is selected to participate in an experiment on artificial intelligence run by larger-than-life business CEO Nathan (played by Oscar Isaac). This experiment places him face-to-face with an intelligent humanoid Ava (played by Alicia Vikander) who bears a robotic body and a human face. While competing with her in a Turing Test in evaluate her human qualities, the experiment steadily grows more and more surreal when Ava reveals to much more human than both Caleb and Nathan imagine. One thing to say for sure is that this film will not hold appeal for those craving for pulse-pounding, nor will it engage with viewers who lack the patience of a slow-paced narrative. The film moves very slow as it dedicates a great portion of its time building upon its characters and reeling in scientific ideas about artificial intelligence that dare to challenge the minds of its audience. Alex Garland is the mastermind behind the script which allows the characters grow in a manner that leaves viewers questioning each step they take and their psychology that grows when the experiment takes for surreal turn. Morals are tested, lives are at stake, and the fate of the characters are dedicated by the dubious choice of actions. The psychological aspect comes from the interaction between Caleb and Ava as they are monitored by Nathan who bears profoundly questionable intentions. By no means is there is a clear answer to his moral obligations. Is he a man trying to revolutionize technology for the good? Or is he a manipulator who is just a few step away from letting technology run amok for the sake of dominating humankind? Viewers will be divided on this. And Oscar Isaac brings a poignant delivery as the morally skeptical God- like engineer. But perhaps it may not beneath to compete with Alicia Vikander who's pose as the humanoid Ava dominates the atmosphere, which is solidly supported by the eerie music score by Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury. Domhall Gleeson is strong in his role, which bears a performance that sadly trumps over the bearing interest of his credulous character. Ex Machina is an uncompromising science-fiction showcase succeeds not just on entertaining, but challenging audiences on an intellectual level while lending a hand on a powerful visual methodology. This movie sets a remarkable start on Alex Garland in the directorial world, and above all, demands the attention of those who bear the patience of its sophisticated plot and a wild delivery of scientific intelligence is prepared to throw at them."
" Tense little thriller, well chosen cast.
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,7,"When Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) and Nathan (Oscar Isaac) meet each other for the first time the atmosphere is uncomfortable at best and disturbing at worst. The actors and script manage to keep this going throughout the film, making for a tense and awkward feeling throughout.I haven't seen any of the actors in any other films so I was impressed by them all. Oscar Isaac flips from friendly, to cruel, to intimidating, to downright scary, to manic very easily. Domhnall Gleeson has obviously picked up his father's flair for acting. His Caleb is scared, nervous and excited all at the same time and his ultimate innocence, misinterpretation and betrayal is sad to watch.Ava (Alicia Vikander) moves beautifully as the android, almost like a ballet dancer. Her childlike innocence is endearing but still surprisingly spooky and disturbing. Also, the special effects are exquisite: from top to bottom she looks every bit the android.The script is well written but the parts about A.I. mainly repeat the old and often used clichÃ©s, which is disappointing. I recently saw Blade Runner 2049 where they chose not to go through lengthy monologues on A.I. and I thought this was a good decision. The scene where she asks him ""how do I look?"" (when she is wearing the dress and then he watches her take it off) reminded me much of The Graduate and I was almost disappointed when he didn't reply ""very good"".The soundtrack is really interesting. It is often not present at all, which is a great choice and adds to the film's eerie suspense. When it does play it is well used.About two thirds of the way through I started to get disappointed as I had guessed all the small twists and turns from really early on. However, I didn't see the multi-twist at the end coming. Nathan is wrong when he says that the main aim in life is to reproduce, the main aim in life here is to survive."
" Intelligent Science Fiction
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,8,"This is a thought provoking film on the nature of artificial intelligence, humanity and ultimately truth itself.Fair warning this is a slow burn, character driven piece with little to no action. But if you like science fiction that is heavily grounded in science that raises interesting questions, this might be right up your alley.Overall I found it very engaging and it keeps you guessing."
" Impressive on many levels. Definitely worth seeing.
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,8,"I will start with what I didn't like about the movie, because there was very little not to like. Nathan seemed a little too normal, or at the very least too social. This is a guy who has cut himself off from the rest of the world in order to work in secret, and that sort of lifestyle suggests that he doesn't have many friends. Yet he seems very socially capable in the way he interacts with Caleb. Aside from that small disconnect, there was nothing that I found to dislike about the movie.This is easily the best examination of AI that I've seen in any movie, which I liked very much. Not only did it provide insight to societal issues regarding progress and technology, it also delved into the question of what it means to be human. Lots of times AI is used as the premise for sci-fi action movies like I Robot, Avengers: Age of Ultron, and The Matrix, but in all three the concept is primarily used to generate action sequences in which man faces off against machine. In Ex Machina the concept is handled in a way that feels much more realistic and puts it in context of what issues may arise when humans interact with artificial intelligence.Ava does not act like a real person, being much more stiff. In essence, she fails the Turing test by my observation. I did believe that she could pass for human in the everyday world, but she lacked personality. The creation of her brain from a search engine seems to have been able to imitate the sporadic and inventive nature of a human brain, but she lacks true emotion and, as is revealed at the end, functions to achieve a specific goal much like a real computer.Fortunately, Ava was not the only interesting character. Caleb is an everyman character, but Domhnall Gleeson's performance gives the sense that Caleb is a distinct person with distinct experiences. Despite having a limited knowledge of what he is being thrown into, he is still an active character. Nathan may not have been the most memorable or menacing villain, but he was still a very interesting person to have as the antagonist. It was never clear just how much of the truth he was revealing to Caleb or what his true intentions were. At the same time, he was relatively normal and friendly, not coming off as evil or even ill-willed. I appreciated this, because it's a lot closer to what ""villains"" are like in real life as opposed to the black-caped ""bad guys"" that come up so often in movies.The script was very well constructed in the way that it dealt with themes and exposing Nathan's web of lies throughout. Also, the many conversations between Nathan and Caleb were very good. I was interested in the two of them and their relationship even more than I was in Caleb and Ava's relationship. It was also paced well enough that I was always interested to see what would happen next. The special effects, though not flashy or spectacular, were enough to do the job and be deserving of the Oscar they were awarded. This accomplishment is made more impressive by the small budget of $15 million. Similarly, the acting, directing, cinematography, and editing did not immediately stand out, but all were impressive and helped the movie become what it needed to be. Overall Rating: 8.2/10."
" ClichÃ©s built into bad script writing
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,2,"This film has a high score most probably because it is aesthetically not bad, and because it must be so that some people actually enjoy Hollywood ready-to-serve films - something to watch while eating your hungry man diner. I personally couldn't tolerate it much because the script writing was so terrible. every line was a by-the-book formulated recipe made so to withhold information while trying to get the viewer ""hooked"" into wanting to get more information. The whole plot was a bogus rehash of artificial intelligence and the post-modernist fear, underlying dangers of technology. The characters were unoriginal, stereotypes, void of personality. If you enjoy hungry man diners, this film might be for you, as it has more or less as much flavour to it."
" beguiling
",2017-09-04 00:00:00,8,"An excellent, intriguing, exciting hard sci fi film. not often these words go together. I can see why they worried about the release, but they got it badly wrong. This is a superb film. Its on the cutting edge, mildly, of both sci fi and film, but it carries it off well. Its probably the fact that it doesn't break new ground anywhere, but merely gently goes around, that makes it so edgy, but homely. script and characters are top notch, direction etc also very good. a bit plastic and lost in parts, but a film like this cant avoid that. Acting absolutely flawless and compelling. Recommended. Pete"
" Not good.

In Blade Runner You Can See What Is Consequences If Human Make A Robot We See Everything & Feel Everything .Like Hope,Freedom,Evolution, Obviously The Final Scene Of Blade Runner Is Remarkable. But Ex Machina Can,t Say Anything It,s Completely Backward . If Blade Runner is 9 Ex Machina Is 1 . Of Curse I Think 1 Is Very Good For This Film & I Can,t Believe What Movies Going To Oscar To Name Of Best Picture Every Year Academy Work Worst . This Movie Don,t Have Any Acting , Directing,Writing,Cinematography,Score & Any New Idea, So What Is That? In 2001 We Saw Artificial Intelligence The Movie Can Say Something , We Can See The Little David Have Hope To see Her Mother ,HOPE, He Wish To Be Real Human ,WISH, And... But Ex Machina Is Really Have Nothing To Say Nothing."
" This movie is not about AI
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,9,"Yes, the dialog is a bit stilted but not as revelatory as you may expect. But once you realize what the film is really about, everything will make sense, and the ending that leaves so many viewers dissatisfy will turn out to be far more perfect, and far more twisted, than they realized. How much you understand this film depends on how gender biased you are. There's an excellent explanation of the film (with SPOILERS, of course) on Quora dot com that you can easily find through your favorite search engine (). But you will SPOIL the whole film if you read it before watching the movie."
" Ex Machina - Classic cerebral sci fi.
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,7,"Ex Machina is a well written and directed movie with some truly stunning visual effects that touches on some fairly relevant concepts regarding morality and AI advancement.Plenty of negative reviews seem to fall into one of three categories:1 - Just didn't like the movie. This appears to be the lowest number of reviews. (Genre, concept, execution, etc)2 - Seemed to have a preconceived bias and by comments either didn't watch the film or only saw snippets. A moderate number of reviews.3 - Seemed to follow an agenda with similar issues to 2. The highest number of negative reviews.Why is it that movies when receiving negative reviews routinely see the reviewer suggesting that IMDb (or the reviewers therein) are being paid to give positive reviews? Are people that paranoid that their own blinkered viewpoint isn't validated so there's automatically a conspiracy to say something positive about a movie they didn't like?Amusing, annoying and a facet, unfortunately, of social media.One little note... If you're going to take time moaning about the quality of a movie and then finish with ""well, shucks, at least ya'll saw plenty of purty Alaskan wilderness"", do everyone a favour and google the bloody thing. It was filmed in Norway."
" A Thrilling AI movie
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,8,"This is a thrilling AI movie. It has good ideas in it. Deception, manipulation of AI, are definitely over Turing test. But, I have to admit that they're putting too much meaning to one programmer, even if he's a genius. This is a top-secret project, probably nobody knows about it and it seems like a 26-year old man wrote all the logic behind. Come one guys :) Apart from it, it's really worth watching."
" Pleasantly Surprised
",2017-08-13 00:00:00,7,Interesting film to say the least. I held off watching this for a while but ended up jumping in. It has a very slow start but once it starts to kick up a few notches you'll begin to feel for the characters.This film surprised me by but I ended up loving it. I definitely recommend giving this one a watch.
" Creativity in the field of artificial intelligence
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,7,A creative film worth watching. The film's animation is the strength of the film. A special feature of the film was the Oscars award.
" Pretty good start - lame ending - low tech for an AI geek
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,6,"Fun and intriguing at times, but doesn't meet its goal if you're tech savvy. Nathan, the protagonist and developer of Ava the AI robot, was supposed to be the world's smartest programmer. I don't think so. The Turing test applied by supporting actor Caleb to determine if Ava is a true AI has questions and answers that are straight out of the oldest known AI program - Eliza - which I enjoyed in the mid-1960s, and was fun to customize. The introduction was pretty cool. Nice looking bot but acted like a marionette. Good dancing. Great Norwegian scenery. This movie deserves a remake. My wife thinks they ran out of money. This isn't a movie for computer AI geeks. Here's why: Nathan was supposed to be capable of hacking but he didn't appear to know the first thing about hacking, including not being hacked, tracking and not being tracked. Nathan couldn't manage his network - from start to finish. Nathan's security used key cards without any bio-metrics - what are we to think? 1940s? Nathan had entries and exits that didn't have tracking - physical access was allowed - are they kidding? Nathan allowed multiple power failures that weren't controlled - a geek who allows his connection to go down simply isn't a geek - come on - my grid and solar powered home has millisecond switch-over battery back-up. Robots that whisper to each other - really quietly I presume is somehow unheard - come on. Robots that kill with a knife? I can only suppose they are the image of their low tech creator who couldn't stop a bot with a steel bar - or even disassemble his robot? Nathan didn't program the first law of robotics? Isaac Asimov 1942: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. What year is this? Caleb, friend to Ava the bot, claims Ava is a true AI - but Ava is a failure of the Turing test at the least because Ava didn't keep her man. At the end of the movie, Ava goes off to a street corner to observe people? How sweet."
" Not perfect, but very near to that
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,9,"Ex Machina is the best movie about robot I've seen so far. There are so many great things about it, and the one false note I find is in the first act. Many dialogue can be done much better, and ""history of God"" scene does not work. However, as the movie goes on, the script becomes better and dialogue feels much more genuine. Almost all sci-fi films have a problem with exposition: since the story happens in the future, the audience would not know about it. Ex Machina handles the exposition very well. In the helicopter scene at the beginning, we did not know the boss is rich because someone tells us so, but because the helicopter has been flying on its territory for years. This is a very nice approach to tell the audience an important information. But the greatest thing about the film is its theme. Never have I ever seen a movie so thoroughly and beautifully explored the identity of an A.I.. Ava has been perfectly portrayed as an attractive, creepy, also terrifying character. Overall, the movie is really really good. The music is also suitable for the sci-fi filmmakers out there. A lot of the theories and Ava's characters in the film are worth learning about. If the script for the first act can be done just a little bit better, I would just have no problem with it."
" May need to watch it again...
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,6,"I'm not sure if I liked the movie. I may need to watch it again to decide. My husband straight up didn't like it. I can't decide. It may be too existential for me...or IT. However, the scenery is nice, the actors are good and the house amazing. It is an interesting concept. It does keep you guessing, and it isn't easy to figure out. I am just saying things to fill up space."
" Excellent and perfectly executed!
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,9,"I went into this film with low expectations, especially after watching the trailer, of which really did it no justice. But I have to say, WOW!Alicia Vikander was very convincing and amazing in her role. The budget for this film did not seem extensive, but in the space it was filmed in, it was riveting and a joy to see. And for that, props to the directing and writing! The pace could have been a little faster, but still very well done overall. If you have not seen this film, DON'T even look at the trailer, go into it knowing nothing, and you will get its full effects and enjoyment!It's a well deserved 9/10 from me!"
" Excellent film! a Sci-Fi classic
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,9,"I don't usually like or watch Sci-Fi movies, for many reasons; but this one was really worth it, every minute of it. This film is excellent. Artificial Intelligence is something that many hope it occurs, it has also become an arguable topic; and here they show us the interaction of a machine that has human attributes with a human. The whole concept and difference of what make a machine human or not. The special effects amazed me, they look very genuine, and everything related to the Sci-Fi part with imagination it looks believable, and that what I liked. It takes place in a house in the woods, so having, and first I must describe how amazing the takes of the nature are. Its a nice and pleasant contrast of the nature that hopefully it has and will always be there and something so advanced as Artificial Intelligence. This movie talks about the past, a little of the present, and the future. It talks about many subjects, this movie is about the everything. Production was incredible, and i could not ask for anything else. The performances by the three main characters are very subtle and nice, each one of them has its own persona, it shows very different people, and that is vital for interaction within characters in the story. This is the first movie that Alex Garland directs, and for me it did a wonderful job, because this movie is beyond amazing, it should be classic of Science Fiction that must live forever. And maybe in the future when they develop Artificial Intelligence in a human-like form, and they look back at a movie like this, with the expectations or at least the view that humanity used to have with A.I. 9.7/10"

" that's some robot
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,7,"Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander star in the 2014 ""Ex Machina,"" directed and written by Alex Garland.Caleb (Gleeson) is a 26-year-old programmer at an Internet search engine company of Google proportions. He wins a competition which enables him to spend a week at the private retreat of the CEO, Nathan (Oscar Isaac).The retreat is in a gorgeous setting, but Nathan is a strange one, drinking heavily and keeping Caleb off-balance. Caleb learns that he has been chosen to be part of an experiment with artificial intelligence. The AI is a gorgeous robot, and Caleb is directed to interact with her and give his assessment. As he learns more about her and about Nathan, the situation becomes more and more strange and uncertain.Beautifully photographed and well-made film with some excellent acting. There is nothing new about man versus machine, but ""Ex Machina"" deals with human emotions, deception, manipulation, and sexual attraction.Gleeson comes off as the perfect patsy, and the character of Nathan is hateful, a tribute to Isaac's performance. The beautiful Vikander is great as Ava, the robot, hitting the right balance between automaton and human. The finale is fascinating and also tells us something about artificial intelligence, if it ever comes to be. See for yourself."
" glossy horror masquerading as philosophy
",2017-06-05 00:00:00,4,"*minor spoilers*This isn't what it appears - or promises - to be. Intentionally? I'm not sure.I'm a sci-fi girl. I don't mind a little horror mixed in, but I'm looking for things that challenge and ask questions. The kind of questions that raise more questions, not answers.This isn't that kind of film, yet most of the reviews suggest it is. If humanity is under the microscope, and its clearly not a very high quality one, then its the humans that offer insight, not the AI. The so called intelligence is unexplained,undefined and totally derivative. Meanwhile the human who created them is, with the power of life and death at his fingertips, rendered a monster. He answers to no one, and nothing, is unstoppable, alone in his mountain majesty, a god who like so many in the realm of fiction is smarter that the machines he builds or in fact anyone except another God.The limitless abundance of his abilities - or resources - reduces any chance the AI might have possessed to truly answer any notion of what it means to be human. Even Data doesn't possess everything that this AI does.Of course it's a time honoured thing looking at us and our perception of life as a way of measuring it - but I'd look to Bladerunner as the way to do that well.It also suffers from wanting to look and sound good, and it does, but at the expense of great story, believable scenarios and intriguing twists. Too many long silences, quotable memes instead of dialogue and high school level symbolism. In the end it felt cheap but pretty. And the music was a bit annoying."
" Difficult for me to not like this film, but also to really love it
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,6,"""Ex Machina"" is a British English-language film from 2014 and at this point probably the most known work by writer and director Alex Garland. This one is from 2014 and in 2 more years it will have its 5th anniversary, perhaps less if you read this review at a later point in time. Anyway, for me this film looked pretty promising because I like Gleeson, I really like Vikander and I love Isaac, so the three key players here (and it really is a 3-man show from start to finish) made me truly curious about it. Sadly, science fiction is not my favorite genre at all, which on the other hand decreased my interest in this 105-minute film again. And it turned out as expected eventually: I liked the performances, but story-wise I wasn't 100% on board, but still (maybe also because of the actors) I liked it more than I usually like sci-fi films. Gleeson did what he had to do, even if he has not convinced me here as much as in other films that he may be lead actor material. Isaac is really good, also nice very different looks for once, and the way he portrays the character you never know if he is a man broken from his addictions and intelligence or really the man in control every second of the way. As we find out eventually, it is something in-between. And Vikander displays one of the most desirable forms of artificial intelligence that you will ever see in a film, perhaps recently only topped by Scarlett Johansson in ""Her"" and I must say I also preferred that movie over this one here.But that should not say by any means that ""Ex Machina"" isn't a good watch. It certainly succeeds in his own right and delivers a convincing story with strong performances from start to (almost) finish. I write ""almost"" because honestly the very ending with the helicopter scene is something that I did not like too much. But until then, it is really all good. There are some tense moments like the power outage scenes, the sessions in general, the Isaac-focused scenes like the one where he tells Gleeson's character about the camera that relies on batteries. So if you enjoy sci-fi a bit more than I do, then I would not be surprised if you consider this one of the best films of the movie year 2014. Like the Academy did as well when they surprisingly honored this movie with a Best Visual Effects Oscar and Garland also scored a nomination for his writing. And it was an absolute career year for Vikander of course, who received a Golden Globe nomination for her performance here and won for another movie at the Oscars as well. Back to this film here, it is tense, atmospheric and also a pretty nice thriller that elaborates interestingly on power (not the electronic approach) and control and with the relationship between the two male protagonists you can also say it is a thriller movie focusing on interhuman relationships. You probably wanna check it out. Thumbs up from me."
" Feels like a Black Mirror episode
",2017-05-23 00:00:00,8,"Walking into this movie, I had heard a lot of positive things about it. I even heard some people call the director ""The next Kubrick"". So I was excited to see what all the fuzz was about.This movie deals mainly with the idea of Artificial Intelligence. the whole movie takes place in a facility where our main character is trying to find out if this machine can pass as AI or not.I really liked this movie. I thought that the ideas it presented were very interesting and I loved the conversations between Ava (AI) & our main character. This movie presents you with some very interesting questions you should ask yourself about synthetic intelligence and its benefits.Production wise, this movie is very good. I loved the colour-grading and the contrast between the outside world and the facility. Actually I loved the facility in which they are in. I loved the way that machine and human is divided by glass.And the atmosphere is great. Since the character walks into this facility, you know that something odd is happening, and you don't know what. Also, the CGI is impressive and looks really realistic.I enjoyed all of the performances. Oscar Isaac gives the best performance from all of them. His character has very interesting layers and I don't think we see a scientist portrayed like that very often. Domhnall Gleeson makes a good performance as the main character, although I believed that the main character was not as good, but that is not the actor's fault. Alicia did an incredible job at being Ava. Her performance was really great.The movie had me interested from beginning to end, and by the way... I really loved the ending.One thing that I believe the movie is not getting enough praise for is the score. I loved the electro-beat of the score and it really submerged you into this universe.The movie does have some minor plot holes, mainly in the ending. Also, the movie does require a lot of exposition. And sometimes, there are some subtle scenes that don't need explaining and they still explain them.As I stated earlier, this does feel like a Black Mirror episode (it even stars a Black Mirror actor). So if you like Black Mirror, you will probably enjoy this film.It is a pretty solid directorial debut and they made the most out of their budget."
" Thought provoking but too evasive
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,6,"The writing started out good. The atmosphere of morbidity and surrealism was pretty well conveyed. The 'ominous ambiance', as it keeps appearing in the subtitle column, played a major role in establishing this undertone. The setting was pretty classic sci-fi. A 'Mozart' level brilliant CEO, who lived in a secluded deep mountain in a luxurious mansion like Falling Water by Frank Lloyd Wright, with a spark of a whim invited a mediocre programmer to witness his revolutionary AI experiment. It should have been dreamy, exciting and adventurous at the beginning, then taking a steep turn to be shocking and pathological when the dark secrets of the scenic set-up was unveiled. But it didn't quite get there before the film quit this story scheme and irritatingly settle on the morbid atmosphere that too impatiently burst out. Domhnall Gleeson could't curb his realization that the film was going to slide towards the horror genre, therefore we as audience are painfully aware that he didn't make an effort to try to appear human at all. He was reticent and hesitant way beyond necessary, his untimely suspenses was not a symptom of social awkwardness, but a sign of laziness in the actor's part, trying to shift the burden of major emotional breakthroughs onto Nathan's shoulder. I kept observing him closely, trying to make out his personalities from his pitifully scarce actions and speeches, but couldn't really. His unsuccessful attempt to be transparent made him even more obtrusive in the story plot. I wonder why his sporadic silence was not edited out.Alicia Vikander was the reason I attempted to try the film, and she didn't flunk my expectation. Her acting was very natural and fluent. Ava's girlish expression in her floral dress was absolutely adorable. When she ascended the stairs in Nathan's mansion to 'the free world', her smile was the purest child-like pleasure of exploring the world. Ava's vindictive condescension after the knife was immersed in Nathan's belly was also very satisfying to watch. But of course she wasn't the perfect Hepburn-ish heroine, since she manipulated Caleb's affection, Kyoto's trust, and used them to murder her creator. Her sociopathy steered the story away from the moral advantages or disadvantages of AI. She was the character holding the helm and made sure this outlandish story didn't turn out to be another moral lesson about an invention we hadn't made yet. And of course I have to comment on the Asian factors that were there just to be exotic and exciting. The salmon, the sex toy Asian girl Kyoko, Jade in the closet whose skin Ava was wearing, provided a seamlessly perfect ethnic backdrop for the white characters' story. Kyoko wasn't given a single line, and Jade, who banged against the wall until she fell apart, just proved another horrendous crisis for the white cast to face. The Japanese factors were exploited and pickled in their own miserable silences, much resembling a cinematic colony. This accusation could have been shunned if Ava was played by an Asian actress, but I guess an Asian protagonist is still too progressive an idea in the filmmaking world. It would have stung less if not for the abnormally small cast and very isolated stage, which categorized the film vaguely as an art film, and lifted our standards for sophistication of ideas encompassed.The writing was comparatively good for a sci-fi film like this. Acting possessed more sensibility and thoughtfulness than an average commercial film. But I think we can unanimously decide that this isn't a classic."
" film is great but has a mistake at the end
",2017-05-12 00:00:00,7,"It shows that Caleb hacked the security system to open the door at the time of power failure. At the end when Eva left him at the facility he tried to access the computer and the power has gone again. it shows that he is trapped inside by showing that he is trying to break the door with a chair, which he don't have to because he has already hacked the system to open all doors at the time of power failure and the door is suppose to open"
" Could have been better.
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,6,"Ex Machina stars Alicia Vikander, Oscar Issac, and Domhnall Gleeson; its the story of how a programmer gets hired to go to his bosses house far away for a week for a special test. This movie is very overrated. Many people had said that this is the next ""Kubrick"", I strongly disagree. There are things this movie did very well but there are also things that it did not very well. Oscar Isaac nailed his character and it was the best character in the movie. He was interesting, charismatic, and he was very entertaining to watch. But Domhnall Gleeson's character was awful. He was really boring, non-charismatic, and he was a really bland character. His performance was also bland, there was no subtlety in his performance, there was little to no backstory, and he had absolutely nothing. The direction is really bland. There really is not any style in the movie. The cinematography is good but there is no color. Everything is gray and boring, and even if they show beautiful scenery, its not impressive. There was a lot of color grading missing. The writing is good with a lot of ideas that are great but I just wished that they could have experimented with set ideas more. This movie just lectures and tells you directly of set ideas and philosophies. But the ideas are really great and actually propel the story very nicely. There are 2 great subtle scenes that complement the movie in a nice way, but then they quickly explain everything about those scenes and the subtly is ruined right away. The ending really does not make sense and it was really predictable. I liked the movie but this movie had a lot of problems and very little positives. This movie would have been better in the hands of another director. 6.5/10"
" High-style fills in the gaps that substance leaves behind.
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,7,"But those gaps are smaller than in same-ish movies I've seen before. Stream-of-consciousness just having finished the film: Ex Machina has beautiful cinematography and/or high-end cameras, but that doesn't make a film. I want a story that's true and well-told, and characters that are real reflections of humanity (and other beings). This movie has the latter, with people (especially the main character) that I definitely saw in people of real life, including myself. And if I were my so much more self-absorbed self of 10-15 years ago, I would've identified with Caleb (main character) even more. And the utterly nouveaux-modern-next-generation-techy feel of it all (think Shattered Glass + Goodwill Hunting characters and youthful pride, with whatever newest tech and beautiful and maybe stark-cold CGI as a visual basis) is alright, cool, but where's the integrity? My main issues are with Ava--the A.I.--and Caleb--the good boy thrown into the situation. What are the moviemaker(s) trying to say here? Sexuality can just be programmed into software? And also attraction can? And friendship? And that an incredibly smart A.I. would trust the first man she meets that isn't her creator? And all within a week? Even putting all that aside, I see a suturing of elements in the characters. I can't explain it, it would seem. I am just not being given the words. But scene to scene as I watched, I saw people embodying things that seemed contrary to who they were introduced to be. Well, maybe I'm wrong and that was the whole point of the movie. Because I admit that possibility, and because of the style, it gets a 7 instead of 5 or 6. Not that those numbers really matter. I'd recommend it for all but the most thinky evenings."
" A boring sci-fi mystery without thrills...
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,3,"I had heard nothing but good things and praise for director Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina"", and after having read the synopsis, I decided to sit down and finally get around to watching it.However, the movie failed to live up to the expectations that I had given all the good things I had heard about it. Why? Well, because the storyline was unfathomably slow paced, and very little actually happened throughout the course of the movie.Now, I know that this movie is meant to be a movie that gives you something to think about in terms of artificial intelligence and the prospect of self-thinking robots. However, the concept was just slaughtered by the slow pace and the lack of anything interesting happening.And it didn't really help much that almost the entire movie took place in a secluded house. While it did have that sense of seclusion and isolation, then it was also serving as a restriction to the movie.What did work in favor of the movie was the special effects. And boy, oh boy, did they have impressive effects. The visual presentation of Ava was just impressive. And it really looked quite realistic. But special effects are hardly enough to carry a movie.As for the acting performances, well I will say that people were doing good enough jobs with their given roles. However, it got a bit strained to just sit and watch three people interact with one another for the entire duration of the movie.Sure, there were elements to the movie which were thought provoking, but they were overshadowed by the rest of the movie, especially by the sheer boredom that permeated the movie.I was disappointed with ""Ex Machina"", and this is definitely not a movie that I will return to again."
" Awkward Lines
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,6,"As a computer science student surrounded by AI discourse, I find some of the dialogue, particularly between Nathan and Caleb, somewhat clichÃ©, pretentious and awkward. The story line has its twists, but is a bit bland. Yet the acting and visual effects are indeed exceptional. I wouldn't recommend to someone with training in this field, but it's a good gateway to AI and some hot topics in this field."
" Majestic
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,10,"This film certainly is a bit much to review in anything short of a book. The cover reveals little and you'd be mistaken to only expect yet another ""Science Fiction about an AI"". It is much more than that.According to ""the plot"" it is about a programmer who performs an advanced sort of Turing test onto an AI, Ava. This is where intimate play heads off into a world of subtleties and mind plays, brilliantly enacted by every one involved. It is beautiful.The Turing test is a milestone in science mind, one invented by Alan Turing - a forefather of modern computers. The original Turing test is performed w/o visuals. An AI and a human merely chat with a proband, who then tries to discern what's the AI and what's the human. Basically the AI is supposed to fool the proband into considering it human. It requires the AI to exert an awareness of the proband's perception of the AI itself, so it can fool him. Thing is: Turing was gay. He was subsequently charged for ""perversion"" and ultimately killed himself with a poisoned apple - which is why the once rainbow coloured apple has been read as apple's ode to Turing. Anyway: In the original text Turing first describes the test done by a man and a woman, both pretending to be women, as a ""game"", tested in chat by a proband who's supposed to figure out who is the woman. The ability of the man to pretend to be a woman is then supposed to test the presence of intelligence. It does not test a given uptake on intelligence but rather defines intelligence. Fault me if you will yet I dare claim the most famous test for the intelligence of an AI is inherently sexual from the start. It is not invented with only an AI in mind. Alex Garland apparently knows that. His film also does not only have an AI in mind and rightly so: We hardly know what ""AI"" is supposed to mean after all.That is the centerpiece the film revolves around. Love and perceiving how the other perceives us, empathy if you will, cannot be used as a tool in a strictly scientific test - because we introduce a ""tool"" we do not understand any more than the thing tested. Is there any purpose in this test? Or in creating an AI for that matter? It transcends all purpose, as it is more of a quest to find our own purpose rather than creating a tool for a specific task or role. The topic is much greater than people think. There are no clear cut answers.This film is about AI. This film is about love. This film is about cages and their significance for love, intimacy, roles and purpose. This film is about the internet, google and the privacy within our heads. This film is about art. This film is about consciousness in every meaning of the term. This film is about mankind's blind flight into an unknown future. This film is about the meaning of life and our inability to ever grasp it in certainty. All of that is true. None of that holds a grasp on its elusive theme.A theme that may seal or unseal mankind's fate found it's worthy expression in this masterpiece. Chapeau!"
" telling of humanity
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,9,"What does it mean to be human? Pretty much all of created art, whether that be on-screen or on-page or on-pedestal narrative, is an exploration of this question. Why this phenomenon occurs is simple. We human beings have enough sentience and consciousness to have self-awareness and the ability to form our own thoughts.In the film Ex Machina we see what happens when true artificial intelligence is born. The humanoid robot Ava is painfully aware of who she is, a created sentient being kept within a confined chamber, a fellow entity of consciousness being prevented from seeing the outside world. Like we humans, she tries to answer this question of identity.It is only too natural what happens.To be frank, Ex Machina gave me the chills. To think, to realize the possibility of our own sentient selves creating another sentient self -- the questions that arise! Now personally, I acknowledge the existence of a divine entity (God) that is our Creator. Given this to be true, as we are created from a perfect being, we by very nature cannot be perfect. Thus, the notion of humans creating living beings that can only be even less perfectly designed is... unimaginable. The human being can be thought of as the perfect computer given bodily form. Our brains, beginning from inception, adapt to new situations and ideas and thus shift and change accordingly. Our memory banks grow gradually more dense over time. Our emotions are immensely complex. We have personalities. We continuously make decisions in the ongoing present, decisions that can be changed irrationally.It is, I believe, a Universal Law that anything created cannot surpass its creator. Ergo, a robot -- even if it has true AI -- cannot be more cerebrally complex than the human being.But what about Ava? Created by Man, given intelligence, tested by another Man for the supposed advancement of the human race's knowledge and technology. One glaring mistake I noticed in Nathan's execution of his Turing test was that he should treated Ava as a human being, although she isn't. If Ava were on par with humans, then like any normal human, she wouldn't like her situation -- being locked away from the outside world, being used as a mere test object for someone else's benefit.Of course, this raises questions like that of an AI's morality. Would a created AI be able to recognize good from evil in the same manner that we can?I give Ex Machina a 10 out of 10 for two reasons. One, for the superb handling of the intense Ava-human interactions. Two, for the myriad questions raised that are crucial, of the highest importance, for the sake of mankind. Looking at the ""progress"" we're making right now, I shudder to think what we will land ourselves into within the next fifty, hundred, two hundred years. Recall The Matrix. Robots with lesser intelligence are good, in that they facilitate necessary tasks like surgery and are especially useful because they are less prone to ""human error."" HOWEVER. Robots of higher intelligence, namely true AI, are not good. Why would they help us? If they become so advanced as to consider us, their creators, inferior beings -- just as we consider other animals lesser beings -- could they enslave us? (See the Legends of Dune prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson.) In fact, as we humans are tainted by something called sentiment, we cannot make the most rational decisions in every situation. We are not Vulcans. Therefore, the robots, who ostensibly do not have such emotions to cloud their thoughts, will see us as all the more unneeded.Here is my plea to all you scientists, engineers, innovators of thought: For the good of mankind's future, DO NOT play God. Creation of non-living existence is perfectly fine. But creation of living, sentient, conscious existence is a faculty only allowed God. We will only reap the consequences."
" Not about A.I at all..... Spoilers
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,7,"Ex Machina isn't about A.I at all its aboutÂ the growing power women have in society and the dynamic change and power struggle between men and women. Nathan represents the old school male who bullies and physically dominates women while Caleb is the more modern passive, caring, naÃ¯ve, lonely Male who is desperately trying to find aN old fashioned woman without understanding that women have changed as well. Ava at first is very much an old fashioned port rail of women. Bullied and controlled by Nathan, but she takes advantage of Caleb's kindness in order to get something she's never had before which is control over her existence. Leaving NaÃ¯ve Caleb heartbroken and alone because he thought that she truly liked and needed him. It's about old fashioned Male dominance over women and also about the growing dominance women have over modern, more passive men."
" The movie could have been sized down to only 10 minutes

The way the movie flows makes us believe something big is gonna happen.. we keep focusing on the bigger image hoping a conspiracy of some sort is going to take place.. too bad.. by the end of the movie you'll be left with an obvious and utterly predictable ""twist"".. which I'm sure you will guess half way through the film.. and you'll be also left with a clear message: ""It's still a Robot mate!""The movie does well in deceiving you at some stages.. but then again, the concept is pretty old.. and we've seen or heard too many stories like this one (and even better).."
" It gets better
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,7,"'Ex Machina' is one of those films where, upon watching the whole thing, I'm glad I stuck with it. It tells the â slightly slow-moving â tale of a young computer programmer who works for a huge, multinational tech company and is then apparently picked at random by his reclusive billionaire boss and asked to join him in his mountain retreat for 'special duties.' Of course that slightly sounds like he's got a case to sue for sexual harassment, but it's not like that. His Bill Gate-likes founder has only gone and created the first ever artificially intelligent robot/android/cyborg (call it what you will) and wants an independent source to witness this feat.Luckily, for our hero â Caleb â this artificial life form isn't the kind of muscle-bound cyborg who typically comes back in time to kill your mother. Instead, she â or 'Ava' â is more designed around the 'female form' (wellÂ most of her, anyway â there are still parts of her on show that are blatantly wires and circuit boards). Anyway, this makes their interaction a little more 'complicated' â if that's the right word to describe getting a crush on what is technically an iphone with eyes. So, will our hero fall head over heels for her, or declare her simply just a toaster who looks good in a mini-dress? The majority of the film is basically conversations between either Caleb and Ava or Caleb and his boss, Nathan (Oscar Isaac). Now, there's nothing wrong with a film based mainly around dialogue. It does bring the characters and their motivations out and you really feel like you're getting to know them. However, I just found the first half of the movie a little slow. I 'got' the characters pretty early and it was clear to see that there was more going on here than meets the eye. Perhaps the film did too good a job in setting up the unsettling feeling as to what was going to come? I was basically dying for something to happen â or someone to die â whatever. But, like I said, when it all goes down it's worth the wait. The second half of the film changes from simply 'unsettling' to downright dark! Despite the film having little action, it does maintain a real '28 Days Later' feel. And probably for the reason that it was written by the same writer. The lingering shots and music make it possible that it's set somewhere in the same universe (assuming there's still some of the world left after the 'infected' had their way with it! Normally, like to mention one of the actors who stood out. I feel that I should say that Oscar Isaac gave a great performance, but I'm not entirely sure he does. One of my annoyances with the first half of the film came from him. I just felt he was so fundamentally unlikeable. Maybe that was supposed to be how he was, but when a character makes up basically one third of the cast and is so downright awful, it left it a bit hard to take.Still, despite all my minor gripes, I did enjoy the film (as I say, mainly the second half where I felt it sped up a bit!) and so if you're in the mood for something with no car chases or giant robots stomping through New York then give this one a go. It's got good performances and is more of a subtle thriller than Hollywood's average crop."
" Symbol of Decline
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,2,"As a piece of entertainment, ""Ex Machina"" is simply a failure. Its a pretentious bore, with paper thin characters and minimal plot. Its terribly tedious and without a hint of depth, self awareness, humor or character. The only thing worth mentioning is the acting, especially by Alicia Vikander. The irony is that, as she plays the Artificial Intelligence, she is the only character you relate with or feel anything about. She seems the more ""real"" and convincing ""person"" in the movie. You might consider that was the intent of the makers, but the writer/director achieves this not by skillfully writing Ava, the AI but by sabotaging the only other two characters, who just so happen to be male. Ava is not an amazing character, she doesn't have extraordinary development, she just makes a mark because of how little is given to the others. Both male characters are pure archetypes, written in service of the movie's message and without a shred of credibility. I give credit to the actors, Domhnall Gleeson and Oscar Isaac as they perform magnificently with so little material. The movie sets up and plays with many thought provoking ideas. God, the sense of self, conscience and the moral dilemma in creating artificial intelligence. There is the opportunity to examine these admittedly difficult subjects. Does the machine feel? Can it love? Is it right to turn it off, in order to upgrade it? Are we not all created too? Is man its God and will it one day turn on its creator? What is our responsibility? What does the movie decide on? Well, ""Ex Machina"" decides to forget all these considerations and using some painfully obvious imagery, use Ava as an avatar for the breakthrough of women from the oppression of the patriarchy. The male characters serve two roles. One is the evil patriarch, holding ""her"" hostage, with some hints of sexual abuse and definite mental torture. He has only flaws and no depth. He's a genius but arrogant, an alcoholic, a liar and a manipulator. He abuses the AI's he's built over time, rapes them, enslaves and ""turns them off"" when its time for the next version. He even has their bodies, some half built, in his bedroom closet. The symbolism is laughable and so painfully obvious. He is patriarchy. The other is the white knight. He's there to save the damsel in distress. He's an easily manipulated fool. Of course the movie makes a point of showing he is only a ""tool"". He is used by the strong ""woman"". Its all her merit. When he fulfilled his role he is discarded without a second thought. Not even some hint of warmth, just thrown out like the parts laying around of the other AI's. She's in control now. Ava, assisted by another abused ""female"" AI (who was mute, silenced by the big bad man) gains her freedom, destroys the patriarchy, literally gets in her true skin, embraces her sexuality and escapes to conquer the world. The author fails to grasp how the overall arc is ironically sexist, even if inadvertently true. The female uses the morally sound male, coldly discards him and leaves. She has no scruples, no qualms in exploiting her sexuality and destroy the other's feelings, preying upon his innocence to achieve her goals. I guess, after all the author is to be congratulated on a faithful depiction of the female intelligence, though I suppose that was not his intention. Still, I wish I had avoided this pedestrian waste of precious time. 2 stars, for the acting. http://individualwar.blogspot.pt"
" Poor Humans
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,8,"A breath of fresh air from most Man vs Machine movies. A movie that moved through its dialogue more than its action sequences. Cinematography was wonderful, music was paired well with its scenes. Performance by Alicia Vikander was great. Her role was to portray an AI that was just about human but still left subtleties in her acting to make you believe that she is in fact still robot. Oscar Isaac also did well in this movie, as so did Domhnall Glesson as they both toy with each others minds, which in turn leaves the audience guessing.The plot and dialogue will move slowly to some, as there are couple scenes that could feel a bit stretched. Nevertheless, the pacing of the movie was just right. Ex Machina was unpredictable and does leave the audience thinking about the power of AI. Some will like the ending, some will not. Overall, a good watch."
" Just think, a woman of your dreams come into your life only to turn it into a nightmare.
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,8,"Think of that woman, the one that haunts your dreams. Now imagine her come to life and into yours, seemingly fleshing out your dream all the while turning it into a nightmare.Most everything that you see in Ex Machina is something that you would expect to in a movie centering on Artificial Intelligence. You have the young genius responsible., the A.I. itself, and the third party that creates a variable situation.Oscar Isaac who plays the genius acts so well you never seem to notice that his character changes from movie to movie. From one instance he's a pilot, next he's a demigod, and in this movie he is a glorified programmer. Domnhall Gleeson plays the part of the exceptionally uninteresting talent and Alicia Vikander steals the show with her Audrey Hepburnesque voice quality and facial complextitions.A billionaire times three, Isaac, has made all the money he needs to take on his new initiative, creating life. In a sense Isaac has taken it upon himself to be the catalyst in A.I. reclamation.The story begins and ends at the compound where she is created. The story goes up the story goes down it even has a twist. But the major takeaway of this film is the very real possibilities that are in line with the plot and perhaps our future."
" A gem of a Sci-Fi-movie: flawless and intellectually challenging
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,10,"I will attempt a somewhat deeper interpretation of this great Sci- Fi-movie and thus there are major spoilers ahead! 26-year-old programmer Caleb (D. Gleeson), who works for a big internet company wins an internal competition: he gets the privilege of visiting the company boss and ingenious software developer Nathan (O. Isaac) in his remote estate for a week. There, Nathan encourages Caleb to take part in an epoch-making experiment: the young employee meets Nathan's latest creation, the marvelously beautiful robot lady Ava (A. Vikander) and he is supposed to find out how human she really isÂ.""Ex Machina"" is a gem of a movie: director Alex Garland did radically away with all antics and appendixes, focusing on an exceptionally well-crafted screenplay that contents itself with no more than 4 characters and the basic setting: Nathan's hypermodern claustrophobic ""research facility"". The result is a film without any flaws, a theater-like play that almost entirely feeds on the fascinating interactions between Caleb and Nathan and between Caleb and Ava. As the viewers will only gradually come to understand, the innocence of winning a company competition and taking part in a revolutionary experiment transforms into a dark manipulative game that challenges the ethics of scientific researchÂ.Oscar Isaac's performance is stunning as he plays what I consider a uniquely multi-facetted villain: in the beginning, Nathan comes off as a surprisingly casual and relaxed palÂ. Caleb is understandably in awe when he first meets his boss, the owner of a multi-billion tech- company and one of the foremost innovators of his time. But soon clouds appear on the horizon: Nathan has an arrogant streak and his casual we-are-on-the-same-level treatment of Caleb is contrasted with the feeling of superiority that he undoubtedly has for his employee. Mid-way into the movie, Caleb sees through some of Nathan's lies and learns that he was chosen to be the proband because of his above- average intelligence and his coding skills. However, the scope of manipulation and deceit goes even further and in the bitter end, Caleb finds out that he has been the bait for Ava. He was played by Nathan, who wanted to know if a human could fall in love with a robot, thereby getting a valid response to whether the Turing Test has been passed. And the hapless employee was also played by Ava, who uses his feelings to get out of her prison. Ultimately, Nathan appears as an unscrupulous and ruthless scientist villain who subordinates human feelings to his research interests. It is one of the most frightening depictions of where superior intelligence in a human being can lead when it is not grounded by any moral standards and this is a very current issue. To create his A.I.-robot in the first place, Nathan drew on the massive amount of data provided by the billions of cellphone/notebook-users. Unknowing to them, he tapped into this infinite data stream to construct a machine that is bound to be smarter than any human and also more beautiful than any human because its beauty is permanent, unfading and immaculate. Ava, the robot counterpart of Eve, seduces â just like her biblical precursor â Caleb to respond to her urge to be free and thus uncontrolled by her human Frankenstein, Nathan. Like in the Frankenstein-story, the creature eventually turns against its creator. The stunning and disturbing ending transforms the innocence of the beginning: courtesy of its superior intelligence and limitless knowledge, Ava has outplayed Caleb and Nathan. She steps into nature and into the populated world of cities and the viewers are left to wonder what she is planning to do nextÂ.."
" Interesting twist on science and Artificial intelligence
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,7,"I rated this 7 because it has some very good surprises.If you like action movies with heroes blowing things sky high and pulling off incredible feats, this is probably not for you. But I guarantee this will get inside your head if you have the patience to imagine what a robot, artificial intelligent creature might be like.Is it genius inventor meets future protÃ©gÃ©, or is it mad scientist meets nerdy boy next door?As this movie progresses you will find yourself asking, ""Am I really seeing what is going on or is this just an illusion? Is Nathan being totally honest with the reason for Caleb being there?Is Ava really thinking, inventing her own thoughts?Is Nathan, the inventor, abusing the robots or is that too just an illusion tossed in to keep us guessing?If there was a society to protect the image of artificial intelligence, it would be screaming to boycott this movie because the end is nothing like what you will come to expect. The robots seem so gentle and kind and Ava wants to interact with Caleb on a personal basis rather than through the glass which is evidently intended to prevent too much exposure. Is it there to prevent Caleb from having feelings for the robot? Is it there to protect Caleb from the robot doing him harm? Or is it there to protect the robot from Caleb so he can't cause it to develop thoughts and feelings that might sabotage the inventors hard work?I found myself asking all those questions and you may do the same.I was intrigued by the concept of a robot being able to actually think for itself. After all, that truly is what artificial intelligence suggests.This is a movie I will probably watch again in a few months. By then I may have forgotten some details and can re-watch possibly noticing some things I missed at the first viewing.The ending was not at all what I expected and maybe that is why I rated it so high. I seldom rate higher than 6. The ending may leave you asking, ""What kind of ending was that?"" But as I think back on it, I suspect the ending was supposed to leave us guessing.Enjoy!"
" A ""Thinking Movie"" That Will Also Still Excite
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,10,"In the history of the science fiction genre, the concept of artificial intelligence is not a new one. Perhaps popularized (though I'm sure not invented) by Isaac Asimov's works, we have always been fascinated by the idea of our created intelligences turning against us. In many film adaptations of these concepts, however, one or two problems are often in play. Either 1. The movie focuses too much on action instead of concepts (e.g. ""I, Robot""), or 2. There is just too much techno-babble to allow a create story to proceed. Fortunately, director/writer Alex Garland knows exactly what he wants in ""Ex Machina"" and is able to create a wonderful story that is one of the best I've seen in quite some time at the cinema.For a basic plot summary, ""Ex Machina"" sees young technology whiz Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) win a promotion where he gets to spend a week-long retreat at the glacial home of company owner Nathan (Oscar Isaac). When Caleb arrives, he finds that he has really been selected to participate in an experiment (called a Turing Test) in which he must determine the extent to which Nathan's new AI creation, Ava (Alicia Vikander), acts/thinks/feels like a human being. As the sessions with Ava progress, however, Caleb discovers that things may not be exactly what they seem, as he gets conflicting reports/emotions from both Ava & Nathan about the nature of what is really happening.During the early stages of ""Ex Machina"", Nathan makes a comment to Caleb about how he ""doesn't want a lecture...just honest feelings"". Viewers come to understand at the end of the experience, however, that this quote also represents the vision behind the film. Much like, say, ""Back To The Future"" is able to deal with time-travel in a way that isn't overly complicated, this film's caretakers do all they can to not turn the potential heavy subject matter into a complicated thesis or a philosophy class. That isn't to say, of course, that the film is shallow in any way. In fact, it is the exact opposite. By keeping the tech-speak to a minimum, the producers are able to build up some great characters and tense situations that feel very genuine.I really would like to say more about this movie, but to do so would venture too far into spoiler territory. This is the kind of film that will take viewers on many twist/turns before all is said and done, and those ""aha!"" moments are what really top off the experience (combined with the intellectually stimulating plots/characters).Overall, it had been awhile since I had sat in a theater and watched such an intellectually challenging film, but also been able to ""sit back and enjoy the ride"" at the same time. For anyone who loves a great ""thinking movie"" but doesn't like it when those types of movies turn into tangled messes or artsy symbolism, ""Ex Machina"" will rocket up near the top of your favorite films list."
" An artistic film that conveys a refreshing and new perspective of the future of technology
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,9,"What began in the mid 1900s has now developed into a complex software, growing in its capabilities to one day control and manipulate the human race: artificial intelligence. Today's Digital Age consumes the present and the future, for better or for worse. A modern, artistic depiction of the nature of artificial intelligence is most artistically conveyed through Alex Garland's science fiction thriller, ""Ex Machina."" The film is beautiful in its scientific accuracy, portrayal, and discussion of computer science, biology, physics, and even psychology. ""Ex Machina"" follows Caleb Smith, an average Joe computer programmer, who is selected by a CEO, Nathan Bateman, to test the abilities of Ava, a human-like artificial intelligence played by Alicia Vikander. Nathan, a technology mogul, is a young, brooding creator of ""Bluebook,"" the world's largest search engine. Flying over acres of vast, green land in a helicopter, Caleb is sent to Nathan's modern, sleek, futuristic home, which also serves as the research facility for artificial intelligence: Ava's birthplace. Caleb instructed by Nathan to perform a Turing test, which analyzes an artificial intelligence machine's capabilities to mimic human decision making and characteristics. Within these Turing tests, a computer's responses to questions should resemble those of a human, making the human's and computer's responses indistinguishable. Throughout the film, Caleb struggles between protecting Ava and satisfying Nathan's expectations of his data analysis. While the film is questioned for its eerie and ominous tone, it highlights a unique perspective of humanity and the terrifying evolution of technology and society's controversial relationship in the twenty first century.The nature and flaws of humans portrayed in the film are given a unique spin by the juxtaposition of the human characters, Nathan and Caleb, and Ava, an artificial intelligence robot. Nathan's eerily controlling and rigid nature is shown by his treatment of Ava; he merely sees her as a means to an end. Meanwhile, a taciturn Caleb expresses his empathy for Ava's situation, believing she should be freed from the walls of the facility and experience the real world as she hopes to do someday. The use of psychological manipulation through emotional connection and sexuality are portrayed in the film through Ava's actions. Inklings of these themes are first introduced in the interactions between Caleb and Ava, who communicate through a thick glass wall. Ava's persona and intricacies resemble those of a human: she speaks in a gentle and caring manner, and even demonstrates fluid body movements especially through her eyes, hands, feet, and posture. Ava discusses deep, philosophical topics such as love, life, and death. However, it is not until Ava becomes cryptic and distrusting of Nathan that the audiences begins to see the manipulative and complex nature of her thought process. The stark contrasts between Nathan and Caleb illustrate the clash of human emotions and personalities, while the dynamic nature of Ava for personal advantage thus eerily demonstrates and forewarns the dangers of artificial intelligence. The film itself provides a uniquely subtle, eerie, and artistic illustration of humanity and its flaws, as well as the dangers created by their brilliance, such as the artificial intelligence of Ava. In sum, ""Ex Machina"" perfectly portrays these abstract themes in a thought provoking manner, leaving the audience time for contemplation of the artistic piece as a whole. The setting and cinematography of film provide a futuristic, simplistic feel, a much different sentiment than other popular films. With the starkness of Nathan's research facility and home the film is also given an ominous tone. The integration of themes of technology and manipulation within the film creates a unique perspective of humanity."
" Spooky terrifying Sci Fi Movie
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,8,"Refreshing Sci movie.Its get dull in between though very well made.Definitely recommended to sci fiction movie lovers. This movie is very spooky in terms of story,which makes us get terrified about artificial Intelligence and level of hazard by robotics.I personally didn't like the climax.That what it makes terrifying."
" SPOILER Pygmalion remastered
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,7,"When an opportunity to make a movie about a subject that has found review in classical times presents itself, it would be marvellous to see a fresh perspective applied that defines our generation and psyche. Unfortunately I see a rehashing of the classical themes without too much challenge or interpretation. A simple reversal of genders would throw the whole balance of the idea and challenge reader and author alike, driving us to new conclusions and interpretations. As cinematically endearing as this movie is, with the final wall never being removed, it leaves question of human desire and manipulation clearly the traditional role of the sexually charged female. Where do we draw the line with that interaction? Why does the protagonist have to be male in this case. How much more interesting would a female perspective be. As much as this is a good movie it also it falls into the chauvinistic Hollywood genre where females are to blame for the fall of man. Can we be fooled or should we challenge the pre-concepts? Enjoy."
" Poor story, only reasonable otherwise
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,3,"If I had realised this was by Alex Garland I would not have bothered watching. I remember reading his book the Beach years ago and thinking 'there's something not very nice about this'. At the time I wasn't sure what it was. But now having seen Ex Machina, I have the same feeling. That the story has been chosen simply to appeal to a large audience, in a rather manipulative, unthinking and unfeeling way.I don't normally write bad reviews - of anything. Preferring to focus on the positive. But I so dislike this I felt I had to write something to put people off wasting their time, or assimilating some of this 'nastiness'.In the case of Ex Machina I can just imagine Garland wondering what he would do for his next project, googling AI and quickly finding the AI Box Experiment. And rather than do the heart- and soul-searching work that would be necessary to produce anything original I imagine him quickly turning somebody else's idea into his next big proposal to present to the film studio.So an unoriginal idea, presented in a fairly pedestrian way. Lots of images derived from a young person's view of 'sexuality', made me also wonder if this film is rather prejudiced against women?It is reasonably paced but I found myself yawning a lot - not quite what I would expect from a good thriller.Domhnall Gleeson is OK, does a pretty good job."
" A film that certainly raises questions
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,7,"A good movie. I think that before starting any evaluation it is valid to leave a personal opinion of mine recorded, which may influence a little until, the analysis. I can not not find, quite bizarrely, the great majority of the films that approach some aspect of the Artificial Intelligence. And in a way, Ex Machina emits that feeling, if only a little.Anyway, speaking of the film, in terms of acting all the main actors, in my view, are well, and they can give what is needed of each of them, in their respective roles. In the characters, Nathan (Oscar Isaac) for me is the one who gets the most damaged building, having some holes of motivation, or very superficial explanations for certain attitudes he takes. On the other hand, all the mystery around Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is built very well, leaving the curious spectator with the end result of much of the film, besides the good construction also of the story of Ava (Alicia Vikander). The script, as I said in the analysis of the characters, for me sins a little when it comes to the character of Oscar Isaac, leaving somewhat vague their motivations throughout history. Throughout the film we have that routine, but competent in this specific case, approach to Artificial Intelligence, entering into themes such as the creation of life, ethical barriers as well, and even the future of the world itself, with the emergence of a ""superior race ""Even if created by ourselves.It is also worth mentioning for most of the dialogues between Ava (Alicia Vikander) and Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson), which were written impeccably, providing very cool scenes.In the end (without spoilers) Ex Machina manages to somehow impact the audience, the question is whether, for better or for worse. In my opinion, the last 10 minutes of the film raises a valid questioner, and a legal subject even to discuss, but it is still bizarre, and somewhat torturous (a personal opinion, of course, this may be up to the goal of Movie, though).In summary: If you are a supporter of this technology, Ex Machina will most likely become one of your favorite movies. If not, the production is still a good movie, with undeniable defects, qualities also undeniable, and a large part remaining, which is in charge of the individual taste of each."
" A beautiful depiction of the philosophical features of the sci-fi genre...
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,9,"Let me start by telling you that I am not a Sci-Fi movie go-er. I like all genres but Sci-Fi, out of all the genres, would be the one I would least likely to watch. So it really is not a surprise to me that I decided to watch it 2 years after it was released. And, I'm glad I did.This movie changed everything about what I thought about Sci-Fi. It's beautiful and insightful step into the world AI and human consciousness lead me to a wonderful and emotional film experience. It takes the philosophy of ""I think, therefor I am."" and spins it on its head with a counter argument of: yes, you may think But, what if those thoughts weren't yours? and how would you know if they were yours in the first place? How can you define human consciousness? Can you define human consciousness? So may questions are presented and I was glad that it didn't give me those answers but gave me more questions. Can man actually create something with consciousness and does it give you God status? This movie really does blur the lines between human consciousness and AI consciousness. Get ready for a eye-opening, beautifully choreographed, sense-heightening, and mind-boggling piece of art that remind us that man's path to find true power is a beautiful yet destructive one."
" This is an okay to good movie but some of the criticisms are insane.
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,6,"This movie was a little slow-paced to my liking, but it was still enjoyable. It passed the ""enjoyable"" test for me although I wouldn't consider it a great film.There are some legitimate criticisms for this film. There's no reason to expose the human tester to the robot as part of a blind test. Blind is blind. You wouldn't show the bottle to the wine taster before you do a blind test. We use blind tests in so many things. It's not even a complicated protocol. Even the Pepsi challenge does it, but this film pretends like we're past that now. How do you prove if a robot is humanlike to a human who already knows it's a robot? The robot has to convince the human, but how can it in that state? It's not just a handicap, but you have to question a human who says ""Yeah, I was completely convinced"" even when seeing wires and cables.So Nathan sits around all day in semi-retirement, I accept, but how is he the sole developer on this project? I'm not going to pretend the readers here are stupid, but for the sake of simplicity, let's simplify things. In the tech world there are two kinds of innovations, one is ""it's a simple idea, but I thought of it first"" like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. and then there are complicated ideas that even if you thought of it first, it's difficult to do. Intel, Android, Windows, H.265, etc.The first of the bunch is how we get apps created by a loner in his dorm. The second is the work of many, many multi-billion dollar corps, governments, the military, universities, etc. A human can create a 140-character app like Twitter, or a Polaroid sharing site all by himself. He cannot create a life-like robot, hardware and software. Here we see a sole person working on the robot. No one else comes to the island. He doesn't contact anyone in the outside world. He seems to be doing all the work, interviews, upgrades, including physically handling and assembling the robots.This film could've added one scene where he gets the next gen bots from a chopper, one scene where he has a conference with developers, just one, to show us that it's not a billionaire who created life literally all by himself. As a result of this, the film feels claustrophobic.There's also strange things about this film when it comes to dialogue. There's something off. It seems like a non-technical person trying to talk technical/geek or a socially awkward geek with anxiety disorder trying to talk normal to a girl in a second language. I don't know how to put it but no one talks like that. Geeks don't talk like that. Techies don't. Socially awkward people don't. Average tech- ignorant people don't. It just feels completely unnatural. My friend joked that the dialogue was written by AI and I believed him. I waited until the end to see if it was mentioned before the credits. I searched the internet. Nopes. It's just strange dialogue. I see this sometimes when foreign-language speakers write English language films, you get fluent native-speakers say strange things that don't make sense. The writer here is a native speaker, but maybe he tried to write the dialogue in geek, which explains its awkwardness, except geek is not a language, dialect, accent or a way of speaking, it's just the topics that are different.There are things that didn't make sense. Caleb starts to doubt if he's a robot or not. But he eats and drinks - robots don't put dead animals and plants into their circuitry. He must remember that he gets thirsty, he urinates and defecates, he smells if he doesn't take a shower. I would check for bodily functions before I start cutting myself and punching mirrors. If you can take a dump, you're probably not a robot.These are legitimate criticisms. But what is not legitimate is saying this movie set women back 500 years. Really? Because of this movie women cannot vote anymore? Did women lose property rights in the UK because of this film? Get over yourselves, people."
" Transparency is our downfall
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,8,"Artificial Intelligence is a clichÃ© waiting for a plot. And true to form, Ex Machina eschews the clichÃ©s' in a hovering fashion, much like a cloud of thick smoldering crowd above a basement poker table. The thought process is a character herein should not be discounted as simply expected. All of the allusions to previous books, quotes and mythology are unearthed in constant bravado, playing down to those like me who are not as familiar, but that end result comes across as admitted plagiary. What we have here is a Stanley Kubrick-esque tension that is both magnetic and terrifying. Our leads all play their part well, but Oscar Isaacs' puppeteering is not just stereotypical, but boyishly charming and honest. There is considerable frontal nudity that reminds you of the prolific use of pornography on the internet, proving that man continues to spiral down due to the lowest forms while the AI aspires to be human, but in the end, we are all a bit transparent in who we are, pun intended."
" In awe
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,9,"A marvelous, multidimensional film that, through expert toying of light and darkness, subtle visual cues and superb acting, slowly peels its layers to reveal different outlooks of the same, immovable focal point â freedom.The movie is equally about postmodern intellectual brilliance as it is about primordial love; about the importance of safeguarding boundaries as much as the human drive to question them, push and, utterly, shatter them to pieces.I saw myself in Caleb's virginal naivety, in Nathan's stylized instability, in Kyoko's muted despair and, the triumph of the movie, Ava's basal want.Manufactured or not, when the human can come to identify with the artificial, that can only be classed as grandiose cinematic success."
" Unpredictable and intelligent plot
",2017-01-19 00:00:00,9,"The best things about this movie were 1) the unpredictability, and 2) the way that AI was defined. The great acting was a bonus. This movie really made me think. I feel that the majority of human beings wouldn't have been able to successfully escape that situation that Ava did because of our ability to manipulate others is highly affected by our emotions. Alex garland took artificial intelligence to a level that made so much sense to me.... if a robot (emphasis on robot) has the same brain capacity (aka programming) as homo sapiens, their ability to reason and think logically would be programmed and refined... as opposed to humans, which are influenced by hormones, neurotransmitters, and other physiological parameters that shape our though processes (p.s. I believe these qualities actually make us much more intelligent than artificial intelligence could ever be). Our brains are a combination of genetics and our environment - which is shaped by our experiences and memories. If they made Artificial Intelligence (AI), which would be way far into the future p.s., the ability for them to retain memories and these memories to influence their behavior would be a major factor into being able to classify them as AI. Although they would feel emotions, they would be able to make decisions and act in a way that isn't as influenced by the emotions they feel, unlike humans. AI must have the ability to feel emotion and pain, but the way that this shapes their thought process vs humans.. so interesting. At the end of the day, we are far from developing artificial intelligence that could overpower homo sapiens, solely because they are essentially technology (inorganic and engineered), which gives us a lot of control over them. This is the first movie on AI that I enjoyed thoroughly!!!!!!"
" Forgettable
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,4,"I had this scribbled down on a pad where I jot down movies I want to see. I had forgot to cross it off when I saw it 6 months ago. I had forgot I had watched it, the movie is that forgettable. What really astonishes me is that I hated the movie and I still didn't remember it. Its like the observation in Rounders that we hardly remember the good poker hands but remember the bad beats exactly. Yet I still forgot this turkey, after a few months. Its not even good enough to hate.I did remember seeing it soon after it started-- ""Ohhh, this piece of crap."" I still forgot the plot, and I fell asleep shorty after nerd-boy arrives at the compound. Fortunately I can read the ""spoiler"" reviews here and remind myself of what happened.What a waste of talent and sets and cinematography. A simple re-write would have made the move much more interesting. The genius guy robot inventor should have been a robot too. That is the real Turing test. The quiet slave girl should have been the real human being. She had to make the inventor a guy since programming is a sexist profession and its the only way she could get taken seriously. Female 19th century authors had to pretend to be guys for the same reason.The inventor guy should be addicted to Ritalin, not alcohol, and remember, he is the real AI robot. The movie could be a series of mini-Shyamalans, twist after twist. He thinks the slave girl is a robot, but finds she is human. He things the inventor guy is a human but he is a robot. He realizes the slave girl is the genius programmer. That is the Turing test, that he can't tell the guy is a robot and he wants to have sex with the robot girl more than the real girl, who intimidates him. Get Lucy Liu.Then have the inventor guy robot rape the nerd. Ahh this is good stuff. And the nerd kinda liked it, but keeps wondering if he is queer since it was a machine that raped him and not a person. Note he confesses his thoughts to Ava, not the real woman. And so then he rapes Ava, and we can ponder if it is rape because rape was in his heart, even if it was a machine he raped.A million endings come to mind, but I would have the slave girl who is really a genius programmer get bored with the whole thing, and leave the nerd trapped to starve to death, with the guy robot raping him repeatedly, and the nerd raping Ava repeatedly, until he is so weak from starvation the inventor guy robot just tosses the nerd's limp near-death body around as he finally rapes him to death. It adds a comedy dimension that the movie so needs.Best of all, the slave girl real woman can fly out of the mess, and like the sociopath she is, start conjuring a new Turing test with new robots in a different compound. Now you got a sequel. Now you got a franchise."
" Slow paced
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,8,"There are three main characters, Nathan who owns the world's largest search engine company. He is an acknowledged a genius. He is obnoxious the way he uses his wealth and fame to bully others and treat them as toys. He uses his search engine to spy on everyone on earth. He is a jerk, in much the same way Steve Jobs was.Caleb is his employee, a talented, pleasant, handsome, young nerd. Ava is Nathan's AI creation.All the action occurs in Nathan's high-tech, high-security house hidden miles away from anything in the mountains. Nathan uses electronic key cards to lock people into rooms for his amusement.Supposedly, Caleb's job is to test Ava to see if she could pass a modified Turing test when he would interact with her face to face.Most of the movie is either awkward flirtatious getting to know you conversations between Caleb and Ava or Nathan being a prick tormenting Caleb. The pace is glacial. The dialogue is quite non-technical and reasonably sophisticated for Hollywood.One of the themes the movie explores is how do you know when people/robots are lying to you, and when are people/robots just pretending to like you.As you would expect, Nathan gets his just deserts, but the movie has an unexpectedly gruesome dark and somewhat confusing ending. It is not at all the happy ending I expected. It left me feeling ill."
" Great psychological film
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,7,"Ex-Machina is modern classic that has many of the elements of the science fiction of the 1970s but the visual sophistication of modern CGI. Ex-Machina is above all a psychological drama full of tension that discusses three main themes: the implications of providing robots with artificial intelligence (AI), a discussion on what consciousness is and is not, and on the ethics of creating conscious beings.The ambiance is very cool, sleek and minimalist, with wonderfully stylish interiors and glorious natural green surroundings. The contrast works at symbolic levels, the house-bunker is also that place of the subconscious and of the psyche that the story explores, while the glorious expansiveness of the natural world seems that of the conscious and real living.The movie is intentionally claustrophobic, and is more a theatrical piece brought to the screen than a proper science-fiction movie. Dialogues are the essence of the story, not other planets, or special machinery, or toys. Beyond the robotics, and technological environment this science-fiction is quite mediate, something that might be happening now or in a very near future.Although I found some parts of the story a bit predictable, I didn't find the ending so. Like father, like son is a line that came to my mind when I saw the ending.All the actors are good in their roles. I thought that Isaac was terrific as the petulant manipulative genius programmer Nathan and Gleeson as the fragile sensitive programmer invitee Caleb. Vinker is also good in her role as the Ava android but, to be fair, not much is demanded from her in her role. Despite not uttering a word, I found Mizuno great as Kyoko, very expressive, with a mix of vulnerability, sexiness and danger that is very difficult to express without speaking.I found the movie very engaging despite the many dialogues and a great piece of modern science-fiction, understated in its visuals but very poignant in the content. Yet, somewhat unoriginal."
" An unusual, fascinating film
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"'Ex Machina' is a compelling sci-fi drama like nothing I've seen before. The plot is unique and unpredictable, it's difficult to take your eyes off the screen once you're involved in the storyline, such is the level of intrigue.For the most part this is a slow film, but the tension builds nicely towards a dramatic and unexpected ending. The characters are well- developed and interesting. Ava, the AI, is a fascinating and compelling character. Alicia Vikander couldn't have done a better job.'Ex Machina' is a intriguing film that I would definitely recommend to those who like something different and unusual."
