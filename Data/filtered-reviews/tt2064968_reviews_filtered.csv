" The longest hour and 26 minutes
",2021-03-20 00:00:00,5,"Without Olivia Wilde, this would be absolutely unwatchable. It wants to be Goddardian and early Woody Allenesk, but it's lack of character development and its weak dialogue not to mention it being devoid of any philosophical or social commentary take it nowhere. Perhaps if Crudup had had the lead and Batemen wasn't cast at all, the acting would have made it more compelling?"
" You need to ""get it""
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,9,"This film is hilariously self aware. It's almost a test and joke on the viewer and I love it for that.If you take this as a film that's meant to make you feel like you're meant to feel sorry for upper class problems, you've totally missed the point.This is a brilliantly subtle piece, where the story ridicules the entire premise of itself.A latter scene of the book reading is actually an amazing explanation to the inevitable critique of this movie; surreptitiously addressing what they knew the critics would say on a superficial understanding of the true meaning.The bravery of allowing the interpretation to be used against them makes this film all the more incredible.Think about the flippancy of this all happening in a week.Brilliant."
" Deadbeat plot and woeful script
",2021-02-14 00:00:00,1,"Do people live like this in New York? Probably. Is it worthy of a movie, absolutely not. A trashy script wrapped up in upper class idealism. The writer thought to put good actors in his movie hoping to cover up the weakness of the plot. As for it being funny, not once did my mouth crease into a smile. From now on when I think of the struggling writers trying to get a movie made of their lifes work I'll think of this woeful drivel and how the movie industry is all about who you know and not hard work and effort.
As to the actors like Jason Bateman and Olivia Wilde I'd say to them, think of your viewers when making trash like this, even if your given pots of money, think of the working class people who pay their hard earned money hoping to get a 'lift' from watching a good movie. I'll always think of this movie as being the epitome of all that's bad in this industry"
" ""You know it was a satire right?""
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,9,"I enjoyed it. It had a sense of humor about itself. As far as I'm concerned it was fantasy, an imaganitive / idealistic story not to be taken literally. Loved the absense of modern technology and the visuals were stunning. I also felt it did a fine job of demonstrating the despair/delusions of those living on the surface. Music was great, and that little dance number at the bar was perfect. Overall I thought it was charming existential crisis of a film."
" Lovely
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,9,"I feel that the bad reviews are from people who aren't into basic psychology and some of the intellectual themes or references in the movie. To me it made sense, and is a very stylish story about a narcissistic wealthy man child, trying to overcome his deficits, as well as those around him learning to be compassionate and accepting of him.
The fact that he comes from a 'rich' family makes him seem like he only has rich people problems, but that's the whole point- he's human with legitimate problems where he becomes his own worst enemy, and may not have had the kind of upbringing that affords confidence and healthy bonding.If you've ever been in a romantic relationship with someone like this, you might understand.
The set and wardrobe styling is lovely and sophisticated. Banter is pretty witty. Overall enjoyable."
" Come on guys, great flick!
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,9,Quite clever. Intelligent. Funny! Much better than its ratings.
" Allen / Anderson / Glanz
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,10,"A few others have mentioned that the tone of this film is reminiscent of Woody Allen and Wes Anderson. I thought so too, which is perhaps part of the reason that I enjoyed it so much... the other part being the casting."
" Pre-ten-sious
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,4,"I've tried making it through this film 3 times in the past few years, each time I forget that I've already started this film.
I read the cast; awesome.
Logline; cool. Standard awkward scenario Rom-com
So I start it.
15 minutes in I remember; ""oh yeah. This one""Was this written by a 3rd year ivy league undergrad?
Every scene the writer chuckles to himself in the mirror, ""ah yes, look how brilliant I am.""
Grandiloquent.
The notion that this is the point, is not lost on me.
That they are outwardly sophisticated while shallow and empty on the inside.
But everything, even the narrator, uses this pretentious dialogue. Even the semi relevant classical and soft jazz soundtrack tries to scream, ""look how brilliant this all is!"".
This script feels like it was written by someone simply trying to impress their other writer friends. Not actually connect with an audience.
Maybe I'll make it through it this time.
The actors are great. This story and vibe are just, ugh.
Like watching the writer stroke off to a mirror"
" Bruce Wayne if his parents never died
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,6,"Typical playboy movie. What guy wouldn't wanna be a rich single bachelor, with beautiful lady friends. I enjoyed the plot, ALL the character actors and actresses. Only way I see someone not liking this is ppl who wanted movie to move a little faster or more outlandish jokes. I would think someone wouldn't dislike the movie simply because it wasn't relatable because that's the whole point.In short movie is good. Biting on few movies like lost in Paris or about a boy, but good non the less."
" I'll watch this movie again
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,10,"I watched tis movie around 2015 and again now in 2020. Although I think it is always a good idea to see something new, I'll watch this movie again in the future. It's a good movie: maybe no pretensions, all that Woody Allen's atmosphere. I like the way things go falling in place."
" A Victorian Novel
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,7,"Peter Glanz's first feature film is a dramatic comedy, it is an oxymoron, but it is also a real type of comedy in which elements of the comic and romantic genre are mixed in a plot of dramatic subjects. The general tone is somewhat decadent, as in a Victorian novel.
If the tone is Victorian, the narration with the voiceover increases the feeling of being in front of a book rather than a film. So if you like sisters BrontÃ«, Lewis Carroll, Joseph Conrad or Dickens, this is the film for you."
" What the hell did I just watch?
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,3,Nothing but admiration for the cast but this was a terrible vehicle for them without exception. It reminded me of one of the more recent Woody Allen films In tone and plot. It was billed as a comedy but there was nothing remotely comedic about it. It wasn't even cute. The use of a narrator just came across as lazy storytelling.
" Can Woody Allen and Wes Anderson sue?
",2020-01-29 00:00:00,5,"Don't get me wrong. This isn't a terrible movie. It's beautifully filmed and well acted, but it's just ultimately unsatisfying. I didn't mind passing an evening watching on Amazon Prime, but I wouldn't have been happy if I'd spent money for it in a theater.The movie starts out with Bateman, as Conrad, laying out his privileged upper class problems to his therapist - played by Tony Roberts! And if that wasn't enough, the soundtrack launches into some New Orleans Jazz to remove any doubt who they're playing homage to here.Of course, Jason Bateman's handsome and well spoken character would certainly be the *villain* in any Manhattan-era Woody Allen films, but that's just one of this movie's many problems.Stylistically, the movie is unabashedly influenced by Wes Anderson. Roberts becomes the narrator, and the movie is divided into storybook style chapters, with occasional amusing cutaways.On the other hand, the plot is lifted from another movie; namely, ""A New Leaf"" (1971), written and directed by Elaine May, and starring Walter Mathau. Mathau plays a spoiled rich playboy who has burned through his entire inheritance, and now must find a way to.get through life broke, which is basically the same plot as this movie. May's version is a classic. This, not so much.Both Allen and Anderson have a real genius for portraying deeply flawed characters in a sympathetic way, and that's where this movie falls short. Jason Bateman is inherently likable, but at some point, you realize you're giving him credit for other characters he's played. As Conrad, he's shallow, self-centered, whiny, and just basically annoying.Without giving away any spoilers, if you're expecting any great self-realization or epiphany, you'll be disappointed. The movie just meanders its way to one of the absolute laziest endings I've ever scene. Indeed, a critical plot point comes and goes so quickly that I initially missed it, and had to go back because I was totally confused."
" If you like Wes Anderson
",2019-12-18 00:00:00,3,... movies you'll be repulsed by the blatant ripping off of his style by this director.
" You can't ape wit
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,1,"This movie is a beautifully styled illustration of the Dunning-Kruger effect. It's got all the trappings of a Wes Anderson film, except wit, character, color, humor, and plot.A cringe-inducing waste of a studio budget."
" Not bad. Great cast.
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,7,"Bateman, Wilde, and Slate make this movie alright, but other than that the story isn't really special in my mind or anything. It's actually a kind of dreary, but you can't help but watch the three of them anyway since they're just naturally interesting (at least to me, since I know not everyone thought highly of this movie).It is what it is, but what it is definitely isn't bad. It's the type of movie you gotta he in a certain mood for, also -- a slow weekend, night, or a rainy day.I was really happy to see Jenny Slate though, since I thought they'd only cast two fairly well known actors. She's always interesting to me for some reason."
" Wow, just wow
",2019-10-12 00:00:00,1,I was about 1/2 way through this snooze fest and fell asleep giving it a well earned 3.I finished it the next day via the Prime Video God's. Upon witnessing the ending I abruptly edited the bodacious 3 to a 1...because of course that's the last step on this grandiose pile of CRAP!
" Loved it!
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,8,"Cant believe I just discovered this. Fan of Bateman and Wilde. Really enjoyed it. Slow paced, good acting, cool soundtrack. I'd watch it again."
" Cute
",2019-08-24 00:00:00,7,"Not every movie has to be award-winning in order to be entertaining, in my opinion. I thought it was adorable, though I think anything was Jason Bateman in it is adorable :)"
" Empty movie
",2019-03-16 00:00:00,1,Probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
" Pretentious Wes Anderson rip-off
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,1,"This is truly awful. It's like the producer's kid saw The Royal Tenenbaums and came home from Brown or Yale and was allowed to make his first movie with a studio budget.Like so many other movies (sorry, ""films"") now, it's like they said ""if we shoot it in NYC nobody will notice how terrible this is!""At least Jason Bateman is in it, but his agent should be horse-whipped for letting him do this."
" Just doesn't work
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,3,It's like they couldn't d code whether to rip off woody Allen or Wes Anderson. The bits don't work either.
" Saw it twice. Changed my mind.
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,7,"The first time I saw this, I am not sure I could get through it. Maybe I didn't. But I usually finish movies I don't like. Anyhoo. I watched it again today. And it must have fit some mood but I totally adored it. Now it is not my favorite and maybe it should really only be a 6 but I am feeling generous. It is humid, I have a headache and am tired so a movie about not much but a general idea seems perfectly fitting."
" What did I just watch?
",2018-05-10 00:00:00,3,I was disappointed bc I'm a fan of Jason Bateman and he usually has pretty good films. It was to mildly entertaining and just all over the place.
" If Woody Allen did a light fluffy 'Doris Day"" comedy this would be it.
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,7,"I've always liked the three main characters, Bateman, Wilde and Crudup. This is like a Doris Day style comedy with the feel of a more sophisticated script and style, ala Woody Allen. Even has a slightly more serious message than earlier Romantic comedies. Not a bad ride, as far as romantic comedies go. I would recommend it for it's interesting quirks and dialogue."
" We talked until the sun came up
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,4,"Conrad Valmont (Jason Bateman) is a rich man almost 40 ""easing into adulthood."" He wants a relationship but has trouble with them. Then out of the blue, his parents while away, opt to get divorced and he is cut off because...he is. He rooms with a friend (Billy Crudup) and steals his prospective girlfriend Beatrice (Olivia Wilde). He tells neither of them of his financial situation, letting them think he is still rich. He has no trouble lying, stealing, borrowing, and being a general A-hole.The movie has a monologue to fill in plot points and some theme ideas. It has some minor comedy such as when Beatrice claims she is a vegetarian not because she loves animals, but hates vegetables. The dialogue appears to be the film's strong point, although it was overly pretentious, as was the film. The film is critical of people being pretentious and those who say they are pretentious, perhaps done as a way to be critical of the great Romantic novelists or those who inherit their wealth or all those critics who are going to say this was a pretentious film.There are scenes that are similar to what you might see in a Woody Allen film, but are second rate.The film was boring. I couldn't relate to any of the shallow characters. Valmont was the only real developed character and he was stiff. Worse than ""Arthur 2"".No F-bombs or nudity. Implied sex."
" ironically even more shallow than its protagonist
",2017-12-03 00:00:00,5,"The premise is interesting - describing a crisis in a life of a spoiled, shallow, born-rich, almost-middle-aged guy, having a comedic view of it.Also, it looks very nice, too nice, really, essentially unreal, which is nice in comparison to this guy's life, which is also such.But that's basically all there is to it. It's not fun, though that is by design. It has but a few good jokes. There are no really fundamental observations on human nature. Well, except that someone who's been spoiled by their 40s needs to have a crisis to _start_ living in the real world - and that their life-long psychiatrist is a part of the problem, not the solution.The cast is actually mostly OK, except that Olivia Wilde being a model is a slight miss - though she's great in other terms. Essentially, they could have just made her an actress or a painter, or something.But the material is just even more shallow than our main character and, by the end, you're basically left with ""what was all this for?""."
" intentional lack of appeal
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,4,"Conrad Valmont (Jason Bateman) is 40, privileged, emotionally stunted, and living off the family's wealth in the family's high class NYC hotel. He is supposed to be writing a book but lives without achievements. His parents separate and cut him off from the family fortune. With no means, he takes the subway to his friend Dylan (Billy Crudup) for a place to crash. Along the way, he meets and falls for struggling model Beatrice (Olivia Wilde). Despite Dylan claiming Beatrice, Conrad pursues her in a week-long affair.With the pretentious narration and the particular characters, this is a story of relatively unappealing people. Conrad has nothing to offer and Dylan is little better. Even Beatrice is superficially drawn. There is no depths to these characters. Conrad's eventual growth is tenuous at best. The biggest problem is that the characters provide no humor in this suppose comedy. It's intentionally flat with no heart."
" Worst Film I've Ever Seen.
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,1,Now I am one to love a terrible movie to pass the time but I can honestly say hand on heart that this is one of the worst films that I have ever seen. The plot line of the entire story is meaning less and in the end nothing changes. The entire story is about a man who was born with a silver spoon and he's been cut off. Are we supposed to feel sorry for him? Are our hearts supposed to bleed because a man who has never done a days work in his life suddenly can't afford to live in a mansion anymore? I certainly don't feel any sadness. It's also pointless because ever though he hasn't got any money it doesn't restrict his lifestyle in anyway. He is still able to attend galas and the theater and in the end he gets all of his money back.Disappointing film which was never going to be good and the actors in this film are brilliant in their own right I don't understand what they were thinking when they agreed to do this movie.
" Quite Good...but one thing spoils it!
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoy movies where they give a peep into the high-class world, however i find it really annoying when not done properly. For example, in this case the main character, born into 'old money' and hence probably well educated, speaks while eating at the table with his fork in the air making gestures. Apart from that, you might have almost believed his character. It might seem a small detail but I find it very disturbing."
" The Longest Week is not a morality play
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,8,"I am always puzzled by the reviewers who use a hidden template on films -- if it's romance, it's gotta be ... if it's drama, it's gotta be ... as though film reviews were written by traffic cops. They even criticize the characters on the screen for being less than moral heroes. Amazingly, the same people who scoff at the rich shallow characters in this film will watch Natural Born Killers and praise it, as though those characters were admirable.But there should be no argument that the characters in this film are exquisitely drawn and portrayed, the scenes are perfect, the dialog impeccable, and the whole plot not at all implausible. These folk are as real as the castles in Europe and the crustaceans under the sea -- why should they not appear on film? Are they less watchable than the usual drug pushers, prostitutes, assassins, blackmailers, rapists, serial killers, and ghouls that populate other films? Those who complain that Longest Week is not a proper a morality play are correct -- it is not. It is a depiction of the sea foam of our society, of people who enjoy the greatest of privilege and return nothing. They are not bad people -- they are just zeroes. They are the useless consumers, the top of the food chain. And we reward them with the greatest of wealth. Kudos for mentioning it. Beautifully."
