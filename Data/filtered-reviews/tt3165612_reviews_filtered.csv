" Not the best. Often hard to watch
",2021-03-08 00:00:00,6,"I watched this show because I really like Alison Brie and well the acting was definitely above 8 stars, but the entire story is really .... I don't know the perfect adjectives to describe it, but it was not good.
And I am being objective because I really don't like cringy romantic movies or shows.
I could put myself very well in that situation and ever time I thought about being in that situation I realized how messed up that life would be and I really hope that no one will end up like them.Personally, I would actually give this 5 stars, but as mentioned, Alison Brie is really beautiful.
1 star for free because I'm very kind.Besides, I would bet a billion dollars that that marriage at the end will end up in a divorce. I'd be shocked if it were holding up for more than 5 years."
" Rom-Com with a twist
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,9,"I've seen my fair share of predictable, boring Rom-Coms, and this one is definitely different. The two main characters and actors are irresistible. The tension is immaculate, the build up is amazing. The movie stays fresh while being hilariously raunchy, and still maintains the classic tear-jerking happily ever after."
" A good rom com after so long.......
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,10,The movie is so good and after so long I watched a good Rom-com as this is my favourite genre loved the way alison brie acted in the movie this might be my first movie of her and she was amazing and jason is good as always. I don't know why they don't make these kind of Rom-coms anymore.
" Harry meeting Sally, for the 21st century
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,8,"The classic rom-com scenario of 'will they or won't they?' gets an update in Sleeping withOther People. Nothing new or envelope-pushing here, just a fun, light movie to unwind to at the end of the day which is sometimes all I really need of a movie. Great cast and great dialogue, definitely worth a watch."
" Witty Rom Com
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,8,"This movie really does what it wants to do; it adds quick talking witty discussions with talk about sex. It can be pretty funny at times, but it also has moments that really appeal to the romantics out there. I might just be Alison Brie Biased but I did really enjoy this movie and have watched it multiple times. The acting is solid from the title two, and Jason Mantzoukas and Adam Scott are both solid.It did what it wanted to, but nothing more. It's not a movie you should watch with anyone else, and isn't ""timeless"", but nevertheless enjoyable.I would, and have, recommend this movie to people I'm close with."
" Still funny
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,8,I'm always up for a good romcom. I enjoyed it and had a few laughs. People need to lighten up with their reviews. It's funny and light hearted. That's what a rom com is! Go watch it
" RomCom for people who don't normally like them!
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,10,"This movie is beyond charming. Brie and Sudakis are in top form here and are both adorable without being cloying. It's a super fun film with a real love story at the center - it's messier than most romcoms and that's why this works as a real film, not just more shleck that studios can make a quick profit from. A great cast of supporting players too. Watch this movie if you're stuck inside and have a little levity injected back into life. It's intelligent and will lift your spirits. And the Modern Love/dance/Molly scene is perfect."
" This is a movie with great potential that actually turned out to be garbage
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,1,I've never hated 2 characters so much in my life the only thing I hated more than the characters was the overall storyline. Alisons character made me physically nauseous. The beginning started out funny and good and full of promise but just plummeted into a steaming pile of worthless garbage. Total waste of my life.
" I usually don't like rom coms but...
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,8,"Usually I can't stand romantic comedies, but this film is different, for one it's unashamedly crude, Jason Sudeikis and Allison Brie have instant chemistry, it also can be insanely funny (my favorite is the scene where Jake teaches Lainey how to touch herself it's crazy funny). It doesn't have the whole ""you made me mad so we can't stay together"" the two leads basically admit they love each other but decide to not act on it. I enjoyed the hell out of this movie it's hard for me to admit that I enjoy a romcom but damn if I don't like this movie cuz I do, it's great and so damn funny"
" When intellect meets raunchy comedy
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,7,"Jason Sudeikis is dynamite in this raunchy yet surprisingly romantic take on rom-com. If you were to see this film with a group of friends, you would constantly be thinking about what the sheltered friend is thinking as they watch the numerous sex scenes unfold on screen. On the opposite end of the spectrum, it had some of the wittiest dialogue I have seen in years from a movie. The final act wraps everything up nicely and is quite wholesome. Great stuff Sudeikis."
" Not a bad story...
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,4,"Over all it's not a bad story, the actors are good, but the movie itself is soo boring it hurts sometimes.
There are jokes, there is romance but it's killed by way to long scenes."
" Cheater
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,2,"There's nothing that bugs me more than a self-satisfied, smug, hipster comedy that thinks it's the funniest person in the room. Sleeping with Other People is that comedy. It's laughing at it's own jokes, and you're stuck blowing in the wind. I didn't care for these commitment deficient, NY socialites who are bemoaning the fact that they are attractive and can sleep with virtually anyone. Jason Sudeikis is almost anti-funny here, which is unusual, because his dorky facade isn't known to come off as phony or unlikable. He charms the crap out of every film he is in. Alison Brie is perhaps the only person to keep watching the film for. She's completely genuine, despite being casted in a largely one-dimensional character. Adam Scott is half-way intriguing as a mustachioed, soft-spoken doctor who cranks the freak volume to Kevin Spacey levels. Just skip it, skip it, skip it."
" Worth a watch
",2018-07-13 00:00:00,7,"The first half of the movie fit the typical romantic comedy shtick however the second half was a bit deeper and fun to watch. The characters had good development throughout the movie and you found yourself rooting for them by the end. It wasn't a masterpiece, but if you have the time give it a watch!"
" predictable, cute, forgettable
",2018-05-15 00:00:00,4,"An updated version of the ""When Harry Met Sally"" concept. I wouldn't say this is a typical Romantic Comedy - It is definitely a romance story but not very funny. Predictable, cute, but I wouldn't watch it again. I can see how other reviewers had forgotten that they already saw this movie when they started it again. It's fairly forgettable...There aren't any parts that stand out as the best or quotable lines or reasons to show/recommend this movie to friends or family."
" It gets a 7 for having some truly hilarious moments.
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,7,"First I will say that in my opinion this movie was worth the watch. It had some moments that had me laughing out loud. Jason's disposition is inherently funny and he knows how to deliver a line. I like Alison, so that was another plus. But that's where the really good things about this movie end. The story line was very flawed and incredibly unrealistic, in my opinion. There is no way that Elaine and Jake wouldn't be together after spending so much time with each other and being in love the whole time, especially considering they lost their virginity to each other. Elaine ends up fucking some random guy that was at a kid's birthday party (which by the way, why would she do is she's in love with Jake?) and Jake is not even that mad about it. Regardless of the title of the movie, I don't like how they perpetuate how it's ""okay"" to fuck other people even when you know you're in love with someone else. It's not something that's morally sound and no one should do that. In a later scene, they are then cuddling in bed, consoling each other, and nothing happens even then. There was a totally lack of sexual and romantic chemistry with these two. They had matching vibes that could've certainly resulted in sexual and romantic chemistry, but the story line never allowed it to develop or show. They really dropped the ball on some crucial elements that could've made the movie truly great. It needed more romance and it needed more passion."
" Outrageous!
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,9,"I wasn't expecting this from this movie but really...this movie has everything! Fast tempo, slow tempo, tonnes of lines with unlimited and really unique dose of humour, romance and 2 amazing actors as main characters. It's also very serious and funny at the same time. You can see it as a light movie that isn't the usual stupid stuff. This movie is a STAR! 9'"
" Best romantic date movie. Period!!!
",2017-10-23 00:00:00,10,"Is there something wrong with all of us??! I mean, why we can't see how see this movie coming? Its under the radar and very very Underrated. It's broke my heart to find out that this movie only gain under $ 4 Million on theater. It's instant classic and easily become my all time favorite. A beautiful heart warming movie that will make you want to fall in love again. Please buy the DVD or watch it online to appreciate this movie."
" Sometimes Sweet But Somehow Unpersuasive
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,7,"Spoiler alert: true love wins in the end! Phew. Got that out of the way. The set up to this sometimes endearing romantic comedy is that the two protagonists meet 'cute' in college, love a bit (light,though momentous) and become reacquainted after many years bearing many of the same 'issues' they had initially. They commit to friendship, navigate the shoals of misguided affairs, and (ta da!) find each other in the end.The actors carry this movie in a way that would not be possible if lesser skill were applied. It is cute, but so overdrawn at points -- is all sexual adventure to be reduced to 'addiction' -- that it is hard to believe. For light fare, though, not so bad."
" The movie is a romantic comedy cliché, but Allison Brie looks hot
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,4,"A rather standard romantic comedy, filled with clichés (like the sassy BFF, which is again played by Natasha Leon, just like the character she played in American Pie) and the usual cynical, fast and supposedly witty dialogue (no one actually speaks like that, not even in NY). However, Allison Brie has a gorgeous body and is often seen wearing sexy revealing outfits, which is great."
" VERY CUTE but crude too...
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,8,"Definitely worth seeing with your significant other! Not a chick flick nor guy flick but good adult couple flick. Don't believe all the hype/reviews. Make your own opinion.I normally don't do crude comedy like Jason Sudeikis seems to be in but this was worth sitting through. Great variety of comedy, sex, love and morality."
" Familiar Story Done Well
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,7,"Sleeping with Other People isn't trying to fool anybody.It's a variation of a love story we've seen dozens of times. But the cast, the chemistry, the script and the production combine to good effect. Cute, funny, romantic, but subtly so, not overdone. Jason Sudeikis is hilarious, witty, charming in his quirky way. Good performances all around, good soundtrack, gave me a tear at the end. Time well spent.About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre""6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating)."
" A good one actually.
",2017-01-30 00:00:00,6,"I expect this movie to be much worse, but it happened to be really good one. Nowadays with that stress from work and the ""computer syndrome"" the count of the lonely people are really big. There is literally no time for romantic dates and ""courtship"" especially in the big cities, so everyone just enjoy the ""one night stand"". And the sad thing is that many woman's are in situation like Lainey's one.Alison Brie good job on that act, but the golden star goes to Jason Sudeikis. He have a good voice by default and he really get into the role in this one. The support crew was good too, i don't have any complains for them."
" trying that Harry and Sally bit
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,6,"In 2002, college student Jake (Jason Sudeikis) finds Lainey (Alison Brie) yelling for Matthew (Adam Scott) in the hallway. Jake and Lainey end up losing their virginity to each other. In the present day, the two run into each other in a sex addiction support group. They haven't seen each other since that night. Jake sleeps with inappropriate women rather than maturely breaking up his failed relationships. Lainey has been in an on-and-off affair with Matthew even after his marriage to Emma. Jake and his best friend Xander cash out by selling their business to a big company. Quickly, Jake is flirting with the company lawyer Paula (Amanda Peet). Jake and Lainey have a platonic relationship but their romance is never far below the surface.This hits on similar terrain as When Harry met Sally. Sudeikis and Brie have some slightly irreverent brand of humor but it's never completely edgy. They seem well matched. The missing element is the uncontrollable heat. Sudeikis is a little too standoffish and always joking around. There seems to be good possibilities with these two but it fails to land that knockout punch."
" Rom-Com by the (Sleeping) numbers
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,8,"Is this predictable? Of course it is! Do the actors and the quirky dialog still warrant a viewing? Very much so, unless you have a total dislike for romantic comedies. Then this will feel like a drag to you. Don't do it to yourself and to the movie. Because obviously you'll have the worst time and therefor will rate it differently.Now, with that out of the way, Jason and Alison make a good match. And you can feel the chemistry in their first ""meeting"". Shouldn't they come together faster than? Well it wouldn't make for a feature length movie if the did. Also there's Amanda Peet to name another reason. Who wouldn't also fall in love with her? But of course, there is nothing like the first love ... at least in movies of course!"
