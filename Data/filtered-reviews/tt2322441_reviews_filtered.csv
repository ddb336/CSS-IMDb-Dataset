" cringe and problematic
",2021-03-24 00:00:00,1,Most embarrassing movie I've ever seen. Emotions alternated between being ashamed to death and wanting to shut down. A mockery of the bdsm world.
" Love it!!
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,9,I can't believe so many of the negative reviews! I lovedddd this franchise!
" Dark version of 2002's Secretary
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,2,I'm surprised the writer of the book didn't get sued. It's basically the same story but darker.
" Horrible sex romantic..!?
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,3,"A rich guy do love one of his new employee...but he has some condition to marry her..
I didnt see strong reason for falling love with her and dont knw why she love him after that awful condition...
Nothing story im this film only sex scenes in whole movie..
Good to avoid this movie..!!"
" Exhausting movie
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,4,"I read the books and I fairly enjoyed the first one (less and less as I progressed through the trilogy). I guess since reading leaves much to the imagination adapting the novels would be a train wreck anyway. The dialogue is cheesy and cringey, and Ana gave me juvenile, child-like vibes (wish is unsexy by default, although Dakota is gorgeous). Christian is hella unlikable and more unlikable in the film than in the books (maybe because actually seeing him being so unreasonable and controlling on screen gets my BP up). Worst of all the sex scenes are exhausting. Halfway through the film I'm already begging that there won't be anymore. It was a pain to get through. It was shot fine enough, but I honestly expected more opulence considering he's a billionaire (some of the rooms resembled entry-level four star hotel rooms). Weirdly enough, I like the book better than the film, but maybe it's because I'm not bombarded with Christian's annoying nature and the never ending low-key porn scenes."
" This movie is cringeworthy.
",2021-02-25 00:00:00,1,Women need to know their worth! This movie is disgusting in a day & age where women are being killed by abusive control freak partners everyday! Not only that it's just a horrible movie the cast the script the acting just everything!!
" Completely awful.
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,1,The most boring and unsexiest movie ever. Total snooze fest.
" My ears! My Eyes!
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,1,"Dear gif this film was a chore to sit through. I tried watching it before but I fell asleep with the first 15 minutes. This time I was determined, though I'm not sure why, to finish it. I'm sorry I did.Watching this film was mind numbing. The dialogue, though not as bad as the book was still horrendous and the acting was barely passable, I've seen better acting in soap operas. No emotions from any of the cast. They all looked like they wanted to get this over with as soon as possible. I can't blame them at all."
" Fifty Shades of Grey
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,4,"4/10 - watching this movie is like watching a car crash - it is so unbelievably awful, but you can't help but keep watching"
" Very rushed
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,5,"As someone who has read the book and enjoyed it (yes really) I was intrigued to see how the movie matched up. It started well, but then quickly deteriorated in what I can only describe as numerous rushed scenes with absolutely no continuity. Many scenes important to the story were simply skipped and some changed completely.
All in all the movie isn't a great success and I was left disappointed.Avoid if you've read the book, you will feel very let down. If you haven't read the book you'll just be left wondering what the heck it was you just watched."
" Story is very sick, not worth watching
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,1,"Sick characters, sick story, lame mind who have written this."
" Stupid waste of time
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,6,"What a terrible waste ! No ending , no beginning , nothing ! Life has enough problems , don't add to them by watching this movie"
" Best movie ever
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,10,"When college senior Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) steps in for her sick roommate to interview prominent businessman Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for their campus paper, little does she realize the path her life will take. Christian, as enigmatic as he is rich and powerful, finds himself strange"
" Definitely the best movie for masochists,
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,1,"Definitely the best movie for masochists, a torture of 2 hours and 9 minutes"
" it's a movie where things happen
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,5,"Its not a horrible movie, but it isn't good either. First, lets start with the bad""Its very boring, the characters are badly written, the whole thing is just porn disguised as a movie, the dialogue is bad and the chemestry between the characters is bad. Oh, and the names are hilariously bad.Now lets talk about the good, because everyone wants to hear me talk about the good things in this movie.The cinematography is good, the colors during scenes are very well done. When Christian is onscreen, the colors are all grey and lifeless, but when Anesthesia is onscreen, the colors are vibrant and orange. Even though the story is boring and a slog to sit through, at least the movie has a story and a reason (kind of) to why the porn stuff is happening. I think anything that isn't related to the plot is garbage.Overall, I this movie doesn't deserve all the hate its gotten, but it still isn't very good."
" Thank you all
",2020-12-27 00:00:00,10,"Good movie and I hope marry Christmas to them
Just don't let the children watching this"
" Disgusting.
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,1,Only if you're an maschilist of first grade or a Donald Dumpf supporter you can like this shameful movie.
" Don't waste your time
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,1,"Poorly made, don't waste your time. It's not interesting and the acting is poor."
" Blech!
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,1,Save your time and watch Secretary with Maggie Gyllenhaal.
" Good movie.
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,10,Great to see.want to see this character ana is lovely.
" I understand what the author was trying to do here but failed
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,6,"I never read the books. When they were hugely popular, a friend of mine told me not to bother with them, that they were ""elementary "".The reason I watched the movie was because it was on TV and I was bored. I gave it a chance. Halfway through, my husband called, I told him what I was watching and told him how bad it was. I finished the movie, watched the second movie. Then watched them again the next night . This surprised me but I will tell you why.I see what the author was trying to do. She put a barrier between them: the old, take me as I am or not at all situation. Girl has to try to adapt and navigate through this new unfamiliar world. The dialogue was awful, just awful. My friend was right, it is very elementary. Think high school level. Throughout the movie I kept wondering why no one stopped the author and told her to work on the dialogue. I would have if I was her editor. I'll give you my favorite example. When Christian finds out Anna is a virgin. He asks, ""Where have you been my whole life?"" Barf. This scene, and I blame the producers or directors here, would have been improved by simply acting with NO dialogue. His facial expression would have done the job and improved this scene.The next scene I had a huge problem with was when she asked Christian to show her how bad it can get with his bondage nonsense. He spanked her, she runs out crying and angry with him, he's confused (as am I) and leaves him. Again, this scene should have been rewritten. If I was in charge of this movie, I would have had him lose control with her and not be able to stop. THAT would have been a good reason for her to dump him. THAT would show that walking away would be very difficult for him, hence more internal struggle.What I liked about this movie? I think casting was good. The actors are excellent given the bad script they were given and did the best they could. I found Christian's character very likable and I don't know why I was drawn to him. I think he's the reason I watched it twice. The entire concept of the movie was good, the author just blew it."
" Blah, blah, blah. People corrupt themselves. The end.
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,1,This is one of those movies where whether the actors are actually any good or not is neither here not there because the script ... well no one could ever sound good reading that garbage which is so bad it could make your ears bleed.But who cares how things sound? This is all about how cool it is to be a sociopath or a shallow thrill seeker acting as if a bit of fun has any meaning. That's one positive thing I can say about this dross because unlike the Sex and the City movies no one appears to be pretending that this is anything other than a cheap thrill for people who think that Las Vegas is edgy.
" Loved it!
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,10,"I never bothered to watch until now and i must say i enjoyed this movie. Not sure why ppl were so harsh, the acting was great! Loved both dakota and jamies performances!! The movie was enjoyable and i look forward to the next one."
" Awful
",2020-11-09 00:00:00,3,"Sitting throw this very long movie is a way of torture. Two hours that felt like five. I had history lessons that were less tedious than this. The only thing i find a little bit interesting to see is the evolution of Christian's manipulative tactics, but it is shafted by everything else. Giveing a 3/10 is pretty generous but i have seen much worse films."
" I felt violated afterwards!
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,1,"This movie basically tries to make abuse look sexy! The characters have the emotional IQ of a three year old, especially the lead female role.I read two of the three books out of pure curiosity, but started skipping entire pages and later chapters just to get through the book. Who has sex three or four times a day!? The books are childlike and absolutely boring. Also, they have no storyline other than two people permanently having sex, a woman with no backbone and an absolutely narcissistic controlling man!Also, if you tell a guy that you are still a virgin, his response should NOT BE let me help you with that problem!!!The movie and the books are creepy. Since when has it become sexy for a woman not to be able to choose how she wants to dress, what she wants to eat, where she wants to go....even her cellphone, exercise and waxing habits are under his control. She is basically just a possession.The movie is rated 16 only! Not nearly enough. I sat in the movies with giggling 16-18 year olds and thought to myself this movie should not be seen by anyone younger than 25 and in a healthy relationship with common sense to realize that this is not healthy or normal. I would feel ashamed if I was the parent who allowed my 16 year old to watch this movie! This is the basis that these emotionally fragile children will build their relationships on one day! This movie opened a lot of doors that needed to stay shut!DISGUSTING!"
" I'm a believer
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,8,I didn't read the books but I loved it!!! I couldn't stop watching and it kept me coming back for more.
" Just love it!!!
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,10,I loved the trilogy!!! I'm in love with Jamie Dornan!!!
" Watching this with my bare eyes, IS A PAIN!
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,1,Why are we here? Just to suffer?THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF MENTAL TORCHER!
" slave movie
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,1,"This movie is really ugly , because how can a person with self-respect sign away her body and be okay with it , no matter how handsome and how rich he is ."
" Loved it
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,9,I have read the books and now I have watched the films whilst on furlough. It is a lovely (sometimes a bit cringy) and great romance. I can also see the awful side to it but I chose to love it! It has been a great escapism.
" Terrible in all categories
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,2,"This movie was confusing, not because of any complexities, but because of the plot, the acting, and the lack of chemistry.
The film's plot is ridiculous; a young chaste woman meets a S&M sex addict and they begin a relationship, but it's not a relationship because he doesn't do romance, but it is a relationship because she really likes him, but she needs to sign a contract so he can do S&M things to her, but she won't sign it, but does all the S&M things anyway... yeah- weird and doesn't make sense.
Jamie Dornan is a great actor... in the fall, but not this. The role doesn't suit him, and he lacks chemistry with south Dakota Who looks as if she's about to burst out laughing in every scene.
Ive read the book and it's pretty awful, but this is worse and awkward and a waste of time."
" So laughable
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,1,"Weak acting all around. Kink for lame vanilla people.
I guess it's romantic if they are rich, but let a guy that works for Wal-Mart or Uber do these things, and he's a stalker.
They'd both be stalkers!"
" It was bad, but.....
",2020-08-25 00:00:00,4,"The movie taught me how to run, which I appreciate.
Run from the theater, I mean!
At least this movie is bette than the Emoji Movie or 365 Days."
" Apparently it is just as easy to make a dreadful film out of a dreadful book
",2020-08-21 00:00:00,2,"An innocent literature student (Dakota Johnson) meets a young billionaire businessman, Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and begins a relationship with him. He eventually exposes his sexual interests and introduces her to his BDSM control freakery. If she wishes to continue the relationship with him she must follow his strict rules.A glossy adaptation of E.L. James's equally dreadful frustrated housewives favourite novel that incredulously, like the book was a runaway success. The eroticism is poorly handled and is decidedly unerotic while the character of Grey is just a slimy handsome creeper and abuser rather than someone ready to share his sexual lifestyle with. As with the novel it spawned two dreadful sequels."
" A Ray of Light in The Fifty Shades of Grey
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,4,"Some books and movies based on them unfortunately are misunderstood by the audience, and not in the good sense of it. In the case of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' (2015), it is no fault of the audience. For, to get to the bottom of the original idea of the story one would have to struggle through bad writing and plentiful sex scenes coupled with luxurious items and status toys. The task is not for the fainthearted, to say the least.Personally, I could not get through the first ten pages of the book, never mind the sex scenes. Not that by doing so I have missed greatly on anything, really. Unlike me, many of my female friends and acquaintances have read the book and also have seen the movie. When asked what it is that attracted them to the story, they could not really say much except that there were some sex scenes that they fancied. Which ones they did not elaborate. I guess for private reasons.Perplexed as ever, I contemplated on watching the movie, but could not bring myself up to do it, as I could not waste even this amount of time on something I considered as 'rubbish'. However, the thought of being an odd one out bothered me greatly. So, I have asked my mother if she could watch the movie and retell me in plain English or rather Russian what the heck the fuss is all about.God bless her, for my mother did!Being a woman of certain independent age when she cannot care less for either men or sex, and being of scientific education, which gives her strong analytical skills, she was able, while watching the movie, to disregard the sex scenes and focus on what was in between. And that is when the initial idea behind it all became apparent. Here it is.'Fifty Shade of Grey' by Erika Leonard AKA E. L. James is the story of an aspiring and educated girl, Anastasia Steele, and her relationship with a mentally crippled by his childhood experiences, sinful and much troubled young billionaire, Christian Grey. Anastasia, being a strong personality, as well as possessing a healthy state of mind and clear vision is eventually able to see through a sick man who is not good for any woman, let alone for himself. Although, Anastasia enjoyed bondage sex with Grey, she walked away on him. The decision that takes strength and courage to do. And that is what the idea of the particular story is about. It shows women that they can do the same and leave unhealthy relationships and inadequate men behind.The only unfortunate thing is that the idea got quite lost under the pile of rubbish, namely bad writing and plentiful sex scenes that diverted the attention from the important message. In this sense movie is much better, as one does not have to struggle through bad writing. One pile of rubbish less.Well, what for sex scenes, I believe they were the expression of the sexual fantasies of the author. As one of my mother's friends, a scientist and a very intelligent man, once said: 'I feel everyone woman secretly harbours a desire of uninhibited and wild sex.' And that is what the author wanted to see in the book and on the screen. Torn between a meaningful message and her lust, Erika Leonard AKA E. L. James lost it to her sexual fantasies. Alas, the creator turned out to be weaker than her creation."
" This is not actually a BDSM story.
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,8,"I'm tired of seeing reviews talking about how this doesn't portray the BDSM community and it's abusive. How dense can you all be? This is a story about abuse and PTSD and how a man who has suffered both immensely realizes that he was shown ""healing"" the wrong way. By a child molester.He showed acts of aggression, and ended up regretting it and seeking help (far more highlighted in the book). BDSM society...has it occurred to you that this book was about a man healing? He was an abused boy, taken at a young age and shown that violence supposedly ""helps"" him. He meets a woman and attempts to continue his path, yet realizes it's not how you love.This has zip to do with the BDSM community and everything to do with abused children, rape as a young boy and how he learned to move past it with a patient woman. We all learn about our partners as we go and this is not different. She says no when she sees how far he wants to take it. And she LEAVES. The end of this is a woman saying I cannot be what you need."
" Toxic and dangerous
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,1,"I'm not gonna say anything about misrepresentation of BDSM because there is enough information on that. What I want to say is how this movie literally gave me flashbacks from my previous abusive relationship because of how much similar Christian's behavior was to my abuser. Lovebombing, stalking, controlling behavior, isolation... How do people not see that? It's not romantic when your partner tracks your location and appears wherever you are, it's creepy and a red flag. It's not hot when your partner tells you what to eat and what birth control to take, it's damaging and humiliating. It's not generous when you get gifts and attention only when your partner feels like you are angry with them, it messes with your head and clouds your judgement. Nothing about it is hot, especially the part of bringing an inexperienced person into your kinks and shaming them for not going along with it or refusing to have an adult conversation with them to explain your side and be understanding about their limits."
" Trash, garbage, etc...
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,1,"Trash, garbage, etc...trash, more garbage and moreTrash script, talentless actors and please Hollywood no more trash"
" Therapeutic as a stand-alone movie
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,8,"He is a controlling, manipulative jerk and was not portrayed as sexy. All along, this was the story of a naive young lady who is blinded by the combination of money, outward physical attractiveness, and a misguided sense of what love is.
It starts as fun, like any romance with a manipulative jerk, and gradually reveals who he really is. We see signs that she is in over her head and wrestling with whether she can leave him.
In my opinion, it should have ended the way it did, with her knowing that she had to leave him, even though her feelings would never stop. Adding sequels belittles her empowering decision.
To anyone who has been in a toxic or abusive relationship, this movie can heal by showing how hard it can be to leave."
" I thought the book was bad
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,1,"What an absolute load of rubbish! Aren't tge main characters supposed to be the ultimate in beauty?

" I blame the author
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,3,"On of the worst Hollywood films ever made. But the book is even worst than the film, so you can't expect a good movie when is based in absolute rubbish. Acting is very poor, but then again the script is sh**.
Don't waste your time."

",2020-06-18 00:00:00,1,"Honestly, I am kind of relieved that most of you hate this movie as well. I was afraid of being attacked by 50 shades fan but seeing yall's reviews, I'm gonna bring up my opinion too.This movie sucks. Typical wattpad. Mainstream. Cheesey. Cringe. Unrealistic."
" Awful casting choices and no chemistry between leads
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,1,First of all who ever decided to cast Jamie Dorman as Christian Grey made the biggest mistake. Second the two leads had no chemistry whatsoever!! You can sense they don't even like each other. It feels forced. There's no passion and Jamie Dorman doesn't have the alpha energy or presence for this role. He shouldn't have taken this movie. This was a fail. I couldn't even watch the rest of the movies. Boring movie!!
" horrendous casting!
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,1,"The writing in the book was bad, but the movie was even worse.
the sex was laughable, Dakota Johnson needs to go find another career path."
" AN UNECESSARILY EXPLICIT DRAMA
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,4,"Fifty Shades of Grey was a horrible experience. I rated this film 4 only because it was way better as compared to the book. Yet, it is another poorly executed film which relies on 'torture'to bring about romance in the two hour runtime. The performances sucked. The whole plot seemed to be okay at first, but even that sucked. The music is the only thing that is actually memorable in this unconvincing pile of crap. Skip this one.
I rate this film: 4.3/10"

" Fifty Shades of Messed Up
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,1,"Oh boy, where do I even begin with this one? This film is most likely for women who want to be dominated, I get that. But the film's cringe-worthy sex scenes, awful dialogue and lazy writing makes this movie almost unwatchable.The movie was going for a sadistic romance about BDSM, but is executed poorly and makes me wonder what kind of drugs would have to be taken to enjoy this movie. My girlfriend enjoys this movie, but the difference between her and I is that I have taste when it comes to films.Romance certainly isn't my style when it comes to filmmaking, but this inexcusable piece of crap was just bad. How they managed to make THREE of these just surprises me. It's truly awful. You can't make me watch this again even if you paid me."
" Hard limit
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,7,"Trying to come up with a review for the first installment of Fifty Shades is not easy, the adaptation from the book, let's just say it has the general idea, the actors where good cast for their characters, but it seemed a bit rushed, the soundtrack is fantastic though. The book had such an impact around the world that I understand it wouldn't be easy to live up to the hipe, but I think more input from the author would've been helpful, the following movies the screenplay was adapted by her husband and that made a big difference."
" Specifically Made for Specific People!
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,7,"A Sensuous Erotica, that prevails on refined execution that explicitly delivers what it was supposed to. A fresh addition into Romance/Drama genre; that sparked lots of Controversies and polarized opinions.
Mainly due to its naked nature in the portrayal of passion and sexual pleasures that has been duly debated all over the community. Barring the hatred, one cannot simply ignore the Polished cinematography and sound design that has been provided. The sets, the ambience, the tonality hit the right note in every frame. Moreover the performances by the main two leads, added the professional touch to it.
Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele and Jamie Dornan as Christian Gray shined well.
It takes a lot of courage and a bit of sincerity to say yes to such provocative yet challenging roles. Some credit should go to the director herself as well!
Sam Taylor-Johnson, did a phenomenal job in her own right. She managed to handle all the nuances regarding the above mentioned characters and carefully crafted the odd but sparkling relationship between them. Alas! The same cannot be said about the other roles. Drifting away from the norm, In this abyss of luscious journey; In the hindsight of passion and intense love; the deeper prospects are not profoundly addressed; but a subdued approach is followed. The subtlety sometimes dragged the screenplay a tad bit though. The sensual scenes, the erotic moments; never seemed vulgar. Although the BDSM aspects at times felt borderline abusive. But it depends on an individual's perspective too. As someone might find it pleasurable; others may find it offensive and far away from a rational thing.
The distinctive viewpoints are obvious, But to consider it as a trash is far fetched and nothing but an intentional ignorance. Sexual likings and All these sensitive stuffs are always borderline controversial. These things can easily go awry oftentimes but that doesn't mean it always needs to be under the microscope of criticism and sort of a plaything for the hateful audience."
" Pretty Old Lovestory
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,10,"Whoever expects something other than a love story here is definitely wrong here. A good implementation of the novel, I find it even better than the book because the embarrassing dialogues with the inner goddess are missing. If you take the trouble to look closely, you can see that Mr. Dornan shows very expressive facial expressions. You can feel all his feelings. And Ms. Johnson is very cute and innocent, just as her role demands. Great staff. Fantastic Soundtrack."
" Not a good representation of BDSM
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,3,"Sigh... I have so many thoughts on this movie but first, off I'll reinforce: It's pretty awful.Second, I know this isn't how the book is written or anything but you know what I wish this movie was about? Picture this:""Anastasia Steele is a successful businesswoman, who owns an empire of companies. Successful from a young age but never seen with a man. One day she is swept off of her feet and onto her knees by English student Christian from college. Anastasia is forced to fight between her sexual desires and her public image as she slowly gives into Christians want's and desires with her"" You know what this changes? It makes Anna actually strong and powerful and it separates her sexual side from her public life. The problem I have with this film is it thinks Anna has to be meek and nervous and afraid just to be a submissive. NOT TRUE. Not to mention Christian is obviously a sociopath and not a dominant. FLYING ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO MEET YOUR PARTNER WHEN SHE SAYS SHE NEEDS SPACE IS NOT PROTECTIVE IT'S ABUSIVE. I wasn't expecting much from this movie but I was still left disappointed with just about everything. The things I liked were the soundtrack, cinematography and that's about it. It isn't the worst thing I've seen but if this is what everyone thinks BDSM is then I wish it was never made. Anna is clearly manipulated into her decision to be with Christian, and even the sex scenes weren't anything special."
" I am really shocked ,how can an erotic thrill turn out to be so good ?
",2020-04-30 00:00:00,8,"It has the perfect amount of everything. Worth a watch .
Really drives u ""Crazy in love"" .
It's a story of how a billionaire falls in love with a middle class college girl nd than she come to Know about his extreme sexual desire of pleasure with pain.
From my understanding, I would say this movie truely disclosed the fact about human being's natural sense. Grey consists black and white. Extremely, fifty to fifty, which is the strongest but weakest at meanwhile. I recognize this pattern as the way things run, according to Tai Ji, the great ultimate.
Extreme gives Christian the strongest ability of control. And control always deal with balancing, thus calmness. If you watched carefully, Christian was so calmed in every scene. Like what he said, that's his way of living.
Ana is the female protagonist of the book, portrayed as being shy and self-conscious. When Christian first meets Ana, she is a student studying English literature at Washington State University, Vancouver and living with her best friend Kate. She is a virgin, and somewhat naive and idealistic in her views of romantic relationships."
" Slow paced film
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,4,This is not the type of film that i would usually watch as i ended watching it with my friends. It was a very slow paced film to start with and took a while to understand what was going on however it was clear that the film was based around the professional relationship between two characters that soon becomes more personal. There was a lack of different characters in the film and was not a very strong story line as all we can get is that it is about a rich man who enters a relationship with a middle class woman.
" I liked it very much what a movie oufff (JK im here for trolling)

" Needs higher ratings!! Casting and story was good and tasteful
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,10,This film was incredibly cast... Dakota Johnson really got the feel of Ana... I always think films never do books justice as you can never really fit a full film into a book but this was tasteful and sexy and had amazing chemistry with all characters. Dakota and Jamie chemistry was flawless. Enjoyed this very much every Time I watch it and helps when you re read the books knowing to think of what these characters look like.
" Loved it

I liked it and i wish more people like that"
" For the Mindless
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,1,"This has to be one of the worst high budget films I've ever seen. Felt like a B movie with expensive cinematography and set. Terrible acting, put you to sleep boring and hopefully if you wasted your time watching it you didn't pay for it. The only reason I put this crap on was because I heard the book was good, and that it might be, but the adaptation is complete garbage. And to think they've made 2 or 3 more of these films is hilarious."
" Seeing the review is bad enough!
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,1,"Never seen the whole movie and I never will since it's not the definition of romance, seeing the reviews is bad enough! Not worth seeing it!"
" Bahahahahah!!
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,2,This movie was hilarious Horrific dialogue. Terrible acting. Directing. Everything about it was a complete joke. Truly tested my insistence to finish what I start. Was literally counting the minutes left after about 20.
" Love it

" A Cinderella tale that has kinky twists
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,8,"While this is a remake of the Cinderella plot, it has some literal and figurative kinky twists. Christian Grey is a very wealthy and attractive young man that trolls the world for women that will satisfy his desires. Anastasia (Anna) Steele is a college student given the task of interviewing the reclusive Grey, something that few have done. Grey is so secretive that the public does not know whether he is gay or straight.
There is a bit of a spark during the interview and they begin a relationship based on a contract written by Grey where Anna is designated as the submissive. For Grey has a difficult time with relationships with women and he is most comfortable when there is an underlying current of S & M with him in charge.
Yet, there is a spark of feeling between them that complicates his world and at first simplifies hers. With his vast wealth, Grey can provide experiences and buy things that Anna could only dream about before. Their relationship remains one of active sex, yet with an undercurrent of tension that can potentially destroy what they have together. It has the potential to burst into a happy ending where they fall into each other's arms in the implied happy ever after final scene.
The movie has some very powerful emotional moments, yet most are unpleasant for one or both of them. At times you feel for Grey and other times you hope that he bangs a knee against a table leg. It is a complex story that in many ways is a more realistic depiction of the Cinderella fantasy."
" Worst move I have ever seen
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,1,"Don't watch it , it's just a waste of your time , and I really wanna give it a 0 but I can't"
" Fifty shades of GAY
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,1,"Horrible movie. I seriously curse myself for watching this garbage. There was nothing in this film. It's neither erotic, nor a feel good movie. It's more like a torture than a soft p*rn. There is no chemistry between the characters. Dakota Johnson is a pure product of nepotism and tbh she couldn't act. And as for the male lead, what can you expect from a model. Idk much bout BDSM but i hated the idea of torture for pleasure. And plus those users who had BDSM hated it too. The girl in this movie ( Dakota) is so stupid virgin and desperate bout sex that she even let him abuse her. Is this where humanity is going to? And the sad part is that some wannabe showgirls are getting kick out of it. Avoid this crap pls"
" MeI hate this movie
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,1,I hate this movie well I'm also kinda mad because I already wrote this but IMDb didn't save it so It might change this answer A little but who cares anyway. I freaking despise the fact that a movie which is purely a man who was rejected by women's fantasy about controlling and having sex with women. It's so gross the way Christian forces Ana to do things his way and is only under moral question until the very end. Another thing is is that the second to last sex scene has this weird almost angelic song in the background which you would expect to see in a martial arts movie when the character evolves or finishes of the enemy. It doesn't fit the scene at all and I just hate it. This movie was made so that a bunch of horny creepy people could be excepted by getting horny at there weird kinks. That's my opinion I'm on 14 so what ever but yeah it's really weird
" Wtf is this movie
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,1,"The first thing is that the entire film is just some perverted mans way of wanting to put his kinks in a pot film and be able to watch it over and over again. Like come on the scene where Christian goes I want women to obey me seems like a sexist who women rejected and now want to make controlling women normal or ok. I mean I'm not a guy or goes around saying pro den things but really this is what the director wanted.The second thing is the ending sex scene with the music that you would expect to see angelic images or like someone mentally or physically evolving to the next level. The music is so Weird when I watch it and it's out of place completely.The third thing is similar the the first problem is that Christian is such a creep and seeing Anastasia being completely fine with the way he wants her to act is so weird. I would think and hope that her character would be smarter or end up not liking his ways until the end(I understand it need to have a good ending) but come on she becomes so willing to a total creep that borders on the line of acting tapes is not ok.The last problem I have with this is that at the end there is no questioning Christians morals, it is purely this is what's happening this is 100 percent ok this is the norm, I absolutely hate it!I'm done now thank you for reading my inaccurate comment"
" Why I hate this film so much?
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,1,Fifty Shades of Grey is very bad.The film hasn't a good history.The film without a history.I just suprising.The film all about s*x.I think they are earn money like this because we always see woman body in film and some people go to this film just see woman.This so sadness.I just say this is awful.Do not waste your time this film.Its all about 'eroticsm'.It was completely lacking.Stilled awkard.Just terrible.
" Spank me like you do.
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,3,"This film was undoubtedly one of the biggest box office hits of the decade, but it was largely due to the already dizzying success of the original material, the erotic novels by E. L. James. I have no doubt that the audience that went to see this film did it out of curiosity or because they had previously read the books and liked it. So, the film already had a well defined target audience. But as I have not read the books (nor do I intend to) I will speak only of the film.Overall, I found the plot very weak. Anastasia Steele is a shy, sexually inexperienced young woman who immediately feels a strong attraction to Christian Gray, a young millionaire with an almost latent aggressiveness. From there, the two have a relationship full of fetishes of authority and pain, where the romance insists on arising and leaving both confused and bewildered, especially Gray, who seems to carry a lot of childhood traumas and like to discount all that on the body. of their young sex slaves. This is the plot of the film, and I am aware that the book is the same, but the truth is that it makes no sense, if we take into account the normal and expected reactions between a man and a woman ...Observe carefully: first, it is almost impossible to find, today, a young adult totally inexperienced in bed and in sex. It can happen, of course, but it is rare. The first meeting between them is also something that could only happen in a book: Anastásia, who should interview Gray, is so tense and shy that she doesn't even know what she is doing! And he, a very busy man, gives ten minutes to a young woman who has not rigorously prepared herself for the interview she wanted to do! He is an intense, even brutal man, who could have any woman, but he is enchanted by the tastiest girl on the planet. Even so, he does not intend a normal courtship, but a sexual and possession relationship, bureaucratic, well defined on paper, forgetting that quickly when the desire and passion became uncontrollable. And everything happens in a fraction of ... days? One day she is in his office, not knowing what to ask him and, a short time later, she is relaxed talking to his mother as if she were already part of the family. None of this makes sense, but this is just a bit of the absurdities of the whole story, common to the film and books.Dakota Johnson is perfect for her character, as she is a totally uninteresting woman, who could go unnoticed by the eyes of the most ardent of males. For his part, Jamie Dornan is too kind and friendly to be Christian Gray. His character should harmoniously combine the beauty and virility of a young adult with a more mature and somber personality than normal at his age and some brutality and strength of character. I even dare to think that the ideal actor for Gray should be (or appear to be) slightly older than Dornan. The rest of the cast is OK but has no room to do anything really good. The dialogues are hideous, and if they originated from the book then I did well not to read it.It goes without saying, I believe, that this film is totally inappropriate for children and teenagers, given the heavy erotic material and the language used. The film's nudity is something that the fans considered residual, but I would consider it too much if it did not take into account the original material in which the film. The film has good production values, starting with good photography, good scene props (it would highlight the famous red room and all its paraphernalia), satisfactory editing work and, above all, a good soundtrack, which is in the heard and has good songs (I would highlight ""Earned it"" and ""Love me Like You Do"").In short: when starting with bad source material, the film was doomed from the start. The only thing that made E. L. James's book good for the cinema was the number of copies sold and the absolute guarantee that the film would sell equally."
" Compared To the Book, This Movie Is Rubbish
",2020-02-17 00:00:00,4,"In all honesty, you may or may not like this film. It all depends what your expectation are and what you are looking for.Everyone knows, the books are literally a woman's fantasies about BSDM sex, so please do not expect this movie to be something sweet and cute like most love storiesIf I was to rate the movie based only on the movie and not the book, it's a shallow, poorly written, mediocre acting film that's much better then the normal porno, but it's more something to waist time with. You can't expect wonders from it, It's not the Notebook, but it's not the worst thing in the world either. A bit of sex, some BSDM, and a messed up love story. No one dies, or is brutally beaten, people have exaggerated a little too much on the movie.Now, If I was to rate the movie based from the books, this is a load of garbage. Fifty shades is supposed to have fifty personalities that he shifts to and from quite dramatically, but in this movie, fifty is just one thing, brooding. There is no depth to the character and the acting is beyond poor. Same with Anastasia, the actress has played the part so poorly that it's infuriating. They have cut out so many important scenes or have slightly rewritten them so that you do not understand the characters like they are shown in the book. Even the sex scenes are so poorly done compared to the books, they were so much better and showed that fifty was all about trust and finding connection with Anna. Yes fifty liked to punish his subs in the book, but he also made it very clear to Anna what she would be getting into. Because he did not want to take advantage of her. Where in the movie this is shown more like he is a predator. In all honesty in the books, it's Anna that's really messed up with her thinking, where as fifty is a broken character that grows and develops into something better.The movie has shamed the book, it did not do it justice."
" Do not watch this film, it is bad.
",2020-02-16 00:00:00,2,Well I thought I would see what all the fuss was about and boy did I wish I hadn't I have seen very bad romantic comedies that are better than this film
" This is so bad
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,1,"I can't even find words to describe how bad it is. No chemistry between the characters, the acting is bad, all is forced and watching this you are thinking: this is so fake. Horrible."
" Immerse yourself and do not resist
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,9,"Ask yourself why would you wanna watch such a movie in the first place.Curiosity, thrill, romance, erotism, sensuality, sentimentality...Do watch it for its concept.
Do watch it for its acting.
Do watch it for its atmosphere.
Do watch it for its wealth of scenes.
Do watch if you are an appreciative person.
And last but not least, do watch it for Dakota Johnson.Do not if you're not appreciative.
Do not if you're all negativeness.
Do not if you're mindlessly judgy.
Do not if you are all in crappy reviews.
Do not if you're all middle-age-era cells, scents and sensations.Keep in mind that nobody's forcing you!Have decency, respect yourself and other viewers.This is a movie personifying the dreams, emotions and desires of many folks around the world.This is a masterpiece in its own genre and category."
" So much for a disappointment...
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,2,"I saw this movie on Netflix a couple days ago, and it was like a 90-92% match in accordance with my viewing habits, so I figured I'd watch it to see how it turns out. For one, Ana falls in somewhat of a relationship with Christian Grey, who is a multi-millionaire who gives Ana more that what she ever wanted, such as first-edition print books, a new car, and even a nice-shiny-new laptop. Later, they have sex, like every single weekend, but Ana doesn't agree with how Grey treats her and other women, and they break up, ending the movie at a very low note and a cliffhanger.For a pure-drama film, I'd say it would probably put me up to 4 stars. But as a romance film, this is such a total disappointment. If you're looking for something better than this total piece of junk, then I would suggest watching My Big Fat Greek Wedding or Coming Home For Christmas. Or better yet, just read a romance novel instead. There is now a lot more romance novels than movies that what there used to be. And every adaption of the book to be turned into a movie turns out to become a huge failure."
" It was not that bad at all.
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,9,"I read some reviews before I watched it and I expected it to be a piece of trash or like the worst movie ever. But it was actually quite good. I was not bored and to me, that is really important considering I easily get bored. It has a story and although they kinda stretched it so it is a bit slow, maybe that is even better because everyone can catch up. I think that there was enough sex and it would be boring if there was more. After all, this is a movie not an adult video. It is for sure not very erotic but do not forget that these people are not porn stars. The acting was decent and the story was not super predictable. I think Jamie Dornan was a good choice. He has that caring killer look. I don't know how to explain it differently. I enjoyed it although I could also take it if it was a bit creepier. So, I do not understand why everyone gave such bad reviews. I mean, it was not supposed to be an enlightening, educational and beautiful documentary or something like that. To people who love this kind of movies, I am safe to say, it is a good movie. I recommend you to watch it. Even if you do not like it, it is not the end of the world."
" Why all the hate?
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,8,"I feel mad at all the 1/10 reviews and the walkouts. People are complaining it was mediocre and wasn't as intense as it was billed to be. Seriously? And if it were the slightest bit more intense than bondage and spanking, they'd harp on how revolting it was. To my mind, yes, there was no overarching plot, but then again not all successful romance movies have had to have that, and it was the first installment in a trilogy, so the build-up should be understandable. It's a BDSM story, after all, isn't it?And the acting? It was beyond reproach. The chemistry between Dakota and Jamie? It was absolutely stunning. The only catch is that the storyline sounded flat and not fully developed, but maybe that's the point? Maybe that's a new subgenre of romance?"
" Love is in the air
",2020-01-03 00:00:00,10,"Loved the pair, don't judge them, just enjoy the moments."
" Nah
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,3,"I'm not a fan of this movie. Such a terrible experience. I thought a rich guy and a hot girl would do it for me. It didn't. It's not romantic, and not intriguing, and not dramatic. It's just blah.3 stars"
" Where is the 0/10 option?
",2019-12-30 00:00:00,1,"For me this was bad, uninteresting and not worth of my consideration in any serious way. So I don't know if it is the subject matter, the idea of it, or the acting. It has been said that art imitates life. If for a minute I can remotely consider this to be art, then if this movie is supposed to represent some aspect of contemporary life, then I ask myself how things got here? I think this movie was wildly popular, particularly with women. Symbolically then, this disappoints me as I could find nothing endearing about it at all. How is it that this is popular? Am I out of step or does this fantasy appeal to so many in life? Is there anything of a higher order that people can turn to instead? I can't remember if I even bothered to watch it all the way to the end. I think in my mind I am trying to wipe out any interest I have or may have had with this. My understanding is that this movie has been turned into a Franchise. At a time in history when the world is at its most abundant stage, this movie and its offspring represents a different form of poverty."
" Only You
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,5,"I must be one of the few straight men to have read the book, but five years ago everywhere you went you saw women engrossed in copies of it (which charity shops are now awash with), so I thought it might provide some useful insights into what women actually seek in men rather than what they say they do. The suposedly all-important Sense of Humour is little in evidence in Christian Grey, unlike the vast quantities of dosh and very expensive presents that he liberally sprays about to facilitate the charmless and very basic advances that unless allied to fabulous good looks or or the sort of wealth that enabled Bruce Wayne to found the Wayne Foundation would never on their own have got Christian Grey to first base with Miss Steele. (Both book and film are extremely vague about where his vast wealth comes from, other than the fact that he is using it to attempt to End World Hunger; but the carbon footprint from his private helicopter alone probably undoes all the good work his philanthropic endeavours facilitate.)There is actually more sex in the film than in the book (which not surprisingly devotes far more space to his billionaire lifestyle - and precious little to his supposedly busy life as a hot-shot businessman - and with the haggling over the contract before their sub/dom relationship can commence), but it remains as chilly as it's inscrutable anti-hero and it's presumably the undivided attention that she's getting that women reading the book - and watching this movie - crave rather than the sex."
" 10/10
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,10,"I watch it before going to sleep every night. Gets me everytime. Hot. Dont be afraid to loosen up folks, you only live once"
" It wasn't that bad I actually liked it .
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,7,The story Arc doesn't develop very dramatically Or rapidly except for the fact that he's a sadomasochist it has something to do with his past (adopted) that's why he's trying to dominate her. So I haven't seen the sequel yet and I plan on doing so. I actually enjoyed this film I just now got around to watching it it's a funny story because my ex-girlfriend told me about it and that the time I thought the film would totally suck. It didn't. All the lower reviews I don't know what that's all about. It's definitely not a one there's no way the film was that bad nor is it directIng or the writing is actually very good. It isn't however like a great movie it's not a10. I would say it's an overall good story and a good movie. Not sure why it got so many one reviews that's kind of odd like these people are paid off to write negative
" LOL
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,2,"Movie is a joke. Stupid concept, characters, story development, stupid everything. It is fun to watch though."
" Fanfic at its worst
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,1,"Whoever thinks that this trash movie represents BDSM and that Christian is good guy who can be ''fixed with finding love of his life'', deserve a good spanking."
" abuse is not sexy
",2019-10-22 00:00:00,1,"I feel so sorry for the writer, I hope she gets therapy."
" I didn't see the movie as a love story
",2019-10-05 00:00:00,4,"Although it's absurd to portray a BDSM relationship as simply abusive, and the characters are boring cardboard cutouts, some of that I quite enjoyed. Occasionally it makes fun of itself and can genuinely deserve a smile. This film is quite well shot visually, with balanced, eye-catching frames and beautiful Seattle landscape visuals. The soundtrack and songs were really tonally perfect, although I didn't see the movie as a love story as much as an off-balance portrayal of a group of people already degraded and misunderstood."
" Dominant & Submissive
",2019-10-04 00:00:00,10,"First of all I'm extremely happy to write about this movie.
This is One the best movies I have ever seen in my life.
This is the 1st movie of Fifty ShadesWhen college senior Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) steps in for her sick roommate to interview prominent businessman Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for their campus paper, little does she realize the path her life will take. Christian, as enigmatic as he is rich and powerful, finds himself strangely drawn to Ana, and she to him. Though sexually inexperienced, Ana plunges headlong into an affair -- and learns that Christian's true sexual proclivities push the boundaries of pain, torment and pleasure.He told her to sign an agreement where he is the dominant and she will become his submissive and also he can punish her if she done something which he doesn't like or without his consent but she rejected to become his sex-slave."
" AWESOME AND SEDUCTIVE.
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,10,"Yeah really.. I don't know what's wrong with all the other reviews.. maybe they don't have the courage to watch this kind of a movie in public or private place..But this movie was jaw dropping, deserves it's due credit. They served what they showed or expected to showcase. Nudity, Eroticism, Sensuality and Thriller all at one place.GREAT BDSM SHOW!!!"
" I felt bad skipping to the sex scenes
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,1,"I watched this movie with my wife (gf at the time) and i wanted to forget about it, until it somehow popped up in my app, this movie was so bad even the main male protagonist hated it, the sex scenes are suspose to be sexy? I felt like i was watching torture porn. But lets move onto the book, in my country a woman got GTA V banned in target but still was cool with her daughter reading this trash, its like i get mentally ill people think its sexy but its gross."
" How dumb you have to be?...
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,1,"To think this is in anyway healthy and sustainable, so eventually leading you to happiness? To think this is most women want to be treated? Wow, I'd think that this level of production, would have the money to hire good writers, and do something tasteful, seductive and romantic, something couples are actually about, but no, is the moronic, simplistic, VULGAR, sexual attraction and nothing else, is this the level of emotional intelligence of USA? I really hope not..."
" I'd rather watch A Walk to Remember
",2019-09-06 00:00:00,1,That's how bad this movie is. Jamie Dornan is not who I pictured when I read the book. I've tried to watch it several times but I get bored.
" Trash
",2019-09-03 00:00:00,1,This movie is the worst thing in the history of anything ever.
" Don't Watch it
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,3,The script is awful and just unrealistic in a way I get what they are trying to go for but no just No
" Love story from heaven
",2019-08-18 00:00:00,10,This is rated 100 because of hoe bad it is but it is still realy smexy
" Really!? This is the worst movie you ever saw!?
",2019-08-16 00:00:00,8,"This is movie is not that bad,ok
can't believe those review...
I saw a lot review and just think
If this movie is really that bad
why everyone talk about it and sell so well
So I decide to watch it
and I really love it!"
" What does she see in him?
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,2,"I actually wanted to like this movie, but the combination of a terrible script and a terrible lead actor doomed me to never be able to get past the obvious question: Why would an attractive, smart, charming young woman like this want to have anything to do with such an immature, insecure a-hole? I've got nothing against the specific sexual practices--hey, whatever gets you through the night--but the wooden (!) male character's insistence on being in control every second was profoundly off-putting and decidedly un-erotic. I did like the character portrayed by Dakota Johnson. I hope Johnson (as an actress) outlives this series and goes on to have respectable career. I'll give the movie 2 stars because the music was pretty good."
" Fifty
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,6,A diffrent movie but I think you should watch one of them because after watching all it becomes normal
" Not the worst movie
",2019-06-29 00:00:00,2,"This movie made for the teenagers, there is no romance just nudity. But still not worst movie and actings are nice."
" my notes
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,1,"Fine, I admit it, I watched it. It should be in discussion for one of the worst movies of all time. It is straight garbo in every way possible. I could have ranted for hours about how much I hated this movie (1 viewing)"
" Perfect movie.
",2019-06-22 00:00:00,8,"I really like to watch this movie, all is perfect."
" Aggressively Average
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,4,"What I hate most about this movie is that it actually could of been good. There's a good plot in there somewhere about a man like Christian Grey starting to fall for who they are dominating. Maybe that is explored more in the sequels but unfortunately this movie just doesn't work on it's own. There isn't any resolution and it just kind of ends after dragging on a while. The first act is entirely forgettable and the last act is stuck in this weird loop of Christian and Anna making up and Christian seemingly beginning to change and then suddenly he decides not to have any character development. I wish i could say I hated watching this movie but truth be told I don't have any strong feelings about it. The only scene I really liked was funny and it wasn't unintentionally funny. Unlike Aquaman which every scene was annoying except one - every scene in this one was just ""eh""Rating - 39/100"
" Sad but still.
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,1,Watched about ten minutes of movie then turned it off. Yes I read all of the books and not ashamed. True the actors didn't fit the parts. I doubt if anyone could be believable. And there are much worse movies than this.
" it was nice
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,8,"One the one hand, it was kinda romantic (?) but on the other hand it was kinda weird and uncofortable to watch...if you pay attention to it..you will understand that the thing he did to her wasnt because he wanted to do them but because his past was haunting him."
" 50 shades of gheeeeeey
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,1,"Worst movie ever, absolute rubbish, dribble, do not waste your time"
" Ouch
",2019-06-10 00:00:00,1,Really bad. Unbelievably bad. Choose any sci-fi film and anything appearing on it will be more believable than this plot. Scenes are super forced. Dakota Johnson is such a bad actress she makes me laugh
" Steamy
",2019-06-04 00:00:00,10,"Bringing the novel onto the big screen was a big project. They took key points from the novel and portrayed them elegantly and sexually. Some would say that this movie is a little risky, however if you are looking for a steamy movie, which captures the novel, then this is the movie for you. They found the perfect guy to play Christian Grey."
" Nothing to do with BDSM
",2019-05-12 00:00:00,3,"It has nothing to do with the BDSM world. They were so wrong with almost everything. They also should cast actors who were more comfortable with nudity and eroticism. The producers only wanted to cash the money during the hype, but forgot the movie.Missed opportunity to have a good look into the wonderful world of bdsm."
" What is the matter with you people
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,5,Do people just not know good movie when they see it? This is not the worst movie ever The Godfather part III or Scar face (1983) or The Godfather part II are the worst movies ever made. This movie has a good story line. It also has great acting. It kind of scary. It is not a 1 out of 10. It is a 5 out of 10.
" Got wood?
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,2,The only wood that you find in this movie is the wooden acting between both the leads. Such a poor movie
" All about sacrificing everything you need for your true Love

" Alright movie
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,5,The movie actually alright when i seen the trailer I thought to myself this movie is not gonna have a plot and it would be only about sex which it was but it ended being a alright movie but there was many scenes that had terrible acting.
" We men are obviously failing at love
",2019-04-17 00:00:00,1,"This movie is porn. Without the D. Twilight was better. The Notebook was better. How to lose a guy in 10 days was better. Hell, the endless supply of B movies from the 90's USA Up All Night was better. I cant believe my anti-porn wife is good with this, but not Debbie Does Dallas. At least DDD had a plot and a goal the girls wanted to accomplish."
" Much, much beter than expected....
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,8,"This film was at forehand a doubtfull film for me to go to. Much sex was expected where offcourse some sex wasn't so bad. But what was I wrong. The film isn't about sex at all. It's about a sexual development in a boy that went wrong because of adult intervention. Anastacia feels the deeply wanted need for intimacy that only can be reached by using the behavior styles (dominancy) that was missed during the abusive relationship years ago. A film with great music, great scènes and real outstanding dialogues, no word is said to much and no missing words eather..... A film about relations and holding ones own morale borders and the widdening of the borders because of the caring love for a person with a inner conflict between, love, lust and intimacy."
" Boring and pointless porn

" The director attempts to earn the brand
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,10,"As the heroes journey has no bearing here, it's the one 'who is now' which angers men for making their journey in betterment not factoring in. Dakota Johnson is so sensitive that her affect swallows the screen through performer empathy. The choice for internal not external is perfect for subjective literarism so the film gets lost inside her mind and nearly can't swim out. It's incredible how she sells every beat. She hangs onto the safeness of the role for dear life to remain endearing, and bravely crosses into eroticism which is very strange for pop cinema, as in they thought the popularity of the book was really about sexuality, not power, so it comes off extremely awkward. The man is less exceptional and I wonder how someone might have sold the character into an artform, where every scene you read nuance and interpretation creating a calculus puzzle between them. That her sexuality is the only thing she can offer is what disappoints men who accuse the female hero fantasy of sitting around, doing nothing, and getting some great reward for it. How the self-insert myths clash is very much 'war of the sexes.' Of course that is the surface reading and arguable. See the way she attempts to reverse engineer him through his kinks is anything but passive; and the way the story infuses sexuality being the person 'inside out' is a serious cinematic study that allows Dakota Johnson to larp as a believable subject for Bertolucci or Lyne. With the female director Sam Taylor it's admirable work inventing all of this for seeing. Often cultural phenomenons breach great truth and warrant a serious contrarian's look; in spite of its box office power hints on an artform there which she mines for through those awkward sex scenes which belong better on the page. This was awkward because it attempts the literary and puts in a serious effort to discover the cinema there; the director attempts to earn the brand, whereas the polished streamlined sequels by Foley went down too easily as commercial products. Meaning this shows a process to good or bad."
" Fifty Shades Of Grey Review
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,9,"When her roommate falls ill, virginal student Anastasia Steele (Johnson) steps in to interview billionaire Christian Grey (Dornan) for her student newspaper. The pair are instantly drawn to each other and begin a whirlwind affair of pleasure and pain in front of a series of ridiculously large windows.
Arriving with all the appendages of a modern blockbuster - a Beyoncé tie-in, a trailer YouTubed 193 million times, a LEGO parody - Fifty Shades Of Grey is one of those movies that the ""internet"" had condemned terrible, sight unseen. The truth is a little more mundane. Sam Taylor-Johnson's film of E. L. James' Twilight fan fiction-turned-phenomenon is neither so terrible to be laughable nor so brilliant to be powerful. Instead, we get a sparky first third, a rote obsessive love story, anodyne kinkiness, contentious sexual politics, slivers of skilful filmmaking and a promising turn from Dakota Johnson.
The set-up is a simple one: bookish Anastasia Steele (Johnson) meets Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), a business tycoon hiding a troubled past, a lust for BDSM (not the driving school) and a penchant for playing really miserable tunes on the piano. He lavishes his wealth on her (a first-edition Tess Of The D'Urbervilles, a snazzy red Audi) hoping she'll sign a contract to become his ""submissive"". She yearns for a more typical movie-and-a-Nando's-type relationship but tests her 'hard' and 'soft' limits anyway.
For the first 45 minutes or so, Taylor-Johnson and screenwriter Kelly Marcel play this smart. Firstly, they strip away the book's ropy language, all the ""Holy mackerel!"" this and ""inner goddess"" that. They also seem to pitch the action on two levels. The fans get their big moments - the first clinch in the lift, Grey's catchphrase, ""Laters, baby"" - but sceptics can glean the sense that the filmmakers are wise to the ludicrousness of it all. From the slick-haired secretaries at Grey House to a business meeting where the agenda includes vaginal fisting and genital clamps, the tone is playful, even flirting with satire.
But eventually the fun starts to flag. As the emotions get more intense and we begin to learn the motivations underpinning Grey's need for dominance (why can't he just be a perv?), the film gets bogged down in repetitive, earnest romantic drama. There are dull family meetings, greenhouse confessions, even a gliding sequence, something not seen in a cinema since Pierce Brosnan's heyday. The less sure-footed Taylor-Johnson's movie gets, the more insistent Danny Elfman's score becomes.
Even the naughtiness won't keep you gripped. In James' novel, there are 14 sex scenes that fetch up one flogging, two spankings, five tying-ups and 38 orgasms. The movie dials this back to four or five sexcapades. After a beautifully edited bed sesh, the antics in the infamous ""red room of pain"" are antiseptic, each visit more overblown and less sexy than the last. Peacock feathers, whips and the inventory at Tie Rack all get an outing but little of it displays any character insight or erotic edge.
Dornan looks the part but feels more befuddled than broken, failing to eat up the screen as you'd hope. Johnson, ironically, dominates. She gives Anastasia both a strength and sense of humour, be it taking the piss out of Grey (and the idea of the character) in a drunken phone call or busting little moves to Frank Sinatra's Witchcraft. She gives Fifty Shades Of Grey more colour than it has any right to have."
" Fifty Shades of Grey aka A Porn Film.
",2019-02-26 00:00:00,1,"The film is all about having sex thing. And so, there's nothing to gain from it. Watching it is just a huge mistake and waste of time and money.So, if you ever don't want to waste your time and money for nothing, don't watch this film."
" how did YOU watch this?
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,1,"I had already watched all the nude scenes in an adult website cause I wanted to see Jamie Dornan naked .I wasn't familiar with the concept of A-list actors (if you can even call then that) appearing nude, but, now I know that's actually a really common thing. Anyways my best friend really like the character Anastasia and was praising the movie so I gave it a watch.I survived the first 10 minutes .That's it! Horrible acting , I just couldn't buy the whole facade. Shut that thing off and had a marathon of Harry Potter series."
" My opinion
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,6,I liked the way the character of Christian was portrayed in the film to be a dominant.
" roll your eyes at me again...
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,8,This film was not as bad as I thought it would be. I've never read the books but I know this is more tame than that. Dakota Johnson plays a good job as the innocent and cute girl Anastasia . because she is cute herself until she meets christian who could be mistkan for a Playboy. Jamie dornan also does a good job but also comes off as very creepy as well as with a crafty mind louring unsesespecting Anna into a contract she never thought shed sign. And before you could say stranger danger he has her over his leg and in his bed. I will say that this film was not bad. Not great but also not terrible. If the sex scenes were taken away it would be almost a rom com. A good job all together and great for valantines if you were to try it out . 8/10 from me 😏
" Terrible story, terrible direction, terrible acting. Awful
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,1,"Do not waste your time.
It's offensive to think an army of professionals got paid to make this movie.
It's offensive that to think it go distributed.
It's that bad."
" Awesome
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,9,"It's a sensitive subject, but the world does have dominant and submissive people. This can be in business, relationships, friendships and well also sex.
Dakota Johnson has done a great job acting as reacting to this unknown of dominance. Great performance."
" Nice chickflick
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,6,"I read the books a while ago and thought they where entertaining, not the best literature but it is not intended like that. The same with this movie i would say."
" Couldn't deliver theme
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,2,"A movie with shear example of failure of direction. The theme is not delivered. Anastasia keep rolling in waiting for changes in Christian but he finally changed half or quarter of what expected. Anastasia been shown such a stupid , dumb, moron that keep going submissive for christian.. That's odd storyline.. Again boredom continued in sequelae in Dark & Freed.. ohhhh such timewasters.."
" An Honest Review
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,10,"My fiance is a big fan of the movies...and I only mention that because she is worse than me when it comes to sniffing out mainstream erotica. So, you know, totally hit her radar.On my end, I brought the book at LAX one night to read on a layover, and I stopped when Grey picked up his phone to call for a helicopter and started using trucker jargon. ""Breaker, breaker, two-nine..."" NO! Not reading any more!I honestly didn't even want to watch the movie after encountering that.However, let's be honest, you aren't sitting down to watch the film because of dialogue or plot.You're watching it because of sex. And, out of all the movies, this one actually delivers the most on it. AND, unlike all the sequels, it doesn't claim to be about anything else. It advertises itself as a movie about kinky sex and it delivers as being a movie about kinky sex.So ten stars. It is exactly what it claims to be and delivers on that."
" Soft porn
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,1,"Soft porn to the nth degree! Almost no plot whatsoever. I watched it on TV for free! Glad I didn't pay to see it. Stayed with it expecting a plot to develop. Hoping for a twist ending. The twist ending was me, staring at the credits and surprised at how boring it was. Proof beyond a doubt that sex sells. The two ""stars"" were totally unimpressive as actors. IMO....One big Faux Paz."
" I actually loved it
",2019-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Really don't know why ppl are hating on this movie, I loved the story, it's messed up but that's life sometimes. And about the sex scenes, they are hot. Lol"
" Someone couldn't get laid?
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,4,"So, even 'Twilight' started to look pretty good to me after watching this BS... Just sad."
" The Best Movie I've Ever Seen
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,10,"When I say that I went into this movie with low expectations, that's just because I had no expectations at all. The only way I could describe Fifty Shades was as a ""BDSM thing with a lot of sex"" without being able to go any further than that. So, when I watched the movie for the first time without reading the books, I was just giving it a fair chance since it looked interesting and I was curious about it. And after seeing it for the first time, I was very impressed.When people say this movie is ""bad"", clearly they've never seen a bad movie in their life. Fifty Shades isn't a porn, abuse, rape or whatever such nonsense that people come up with, and it's so much more than that anf just becomes a lot more special than people,give it credit for. I can really appreciate a movie where I can go into it and have a lot to think/talk about as it's very easy to find the hidden gems within a story like this. Yes, it has a lot of sex; so what? That means nothing to a story about two people falling in love with each other, even when they know deep down that it could never work and the contract serves as a metaphor for an obstacle that I'm pretty sure people experience in their lives. There's so much more to the story than just the sex.Not only that, this was the first time I had ever heard of Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, but all it took was the first ten minutes for me to see that they had something special about them. And I still feel that to this day. They made me care about the characters and for the first time in my life, I was able to relate to them in more ways than I could have ever imagined. Thanks to them, I no longer feel alone.If you haven't seen this, don't listen to the negativity as people have no idea what they're talking about. Calling this ""bad"" or ""unrealistic"" would be like saying that Titanic never happened; the event, not the movie. It's anything but bad and this was the first time when I couldn't breathe, move, or speak--with the exception of the word ""wow""--when watching a movie. And honestly, it felt like either the first movie ever made or the first good movie that I've seen in a long time. I mean it when I say that this is the best movie I have ever seen.Again, DON'T LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS. Fifty Shades os a perfect example of how idiots could criticize a good movie without having anything to back up their claims. Maybe if they could bother to see more than just the sex and BDSM, then maybe it wouldn't be as bad as they thought. You can't criticize anything when you know nothing about it; Fifty Shades is no different.This movie/series has changed my life and overall, I'm not an idiot; I recognize talent when I see it. Just give this movie a chance and don't let the haters change your mind. They wouldn't know a good movie even if someone pointed it out."
" Bad but not totally lost.
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,5,I loved the books and was looking forward to the movies. It was not as steamy as the book but it was still artfully filmed. The actors grew well through the film and played well to each other. I enjoyed the movie as a story of two people finding each other and working their way throughout many differences.
" Atrocious
",2018-11-29 00:00:00,1,"I wish I could give this movie no stars. The acting was atrocious. I eventually walked out after about an hour of watching Dakota Johnson make strange faces. The plot was all over the place. I should have asked for my money back, but this insulted my intelligence so much, I just left."
" ARE YOU GOING TO MAKE LOVE TO ME?
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,5,"Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is a young virginal college literature major not named Bella. When she interviews media mogul Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan), who is not a vampire, sparks fly as they connect. He is handsome and seemingly perfect. She is shy and dowdy. As their relationship builds we discover that Christian learned everything he needed to know about relationships from watching ""9 1/2 Weeks"" and ""The Story of O."" The film is an exaggeration of the male and female psyche in ""the relationship."" He cannot open up and share his ""feelings"" and only wants kinky sex and to care for the woman. She however wants that 10 minutes of cuddling after sex and intimate conversation. Each one attempts to change the other.The people in the film are cardboard figures. They were lifeless and this was done by design to magnify the differences of the sexes. As for me, I didn't find it overly entertaining, although I can see how bored housewives who like ""mommy porn"" will flock to it.Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Dakota Johnson) mild bondage, spanking, whipping...no fisting. 5 stars for the nudity. Thanks Dakota."
" Can't wait to see other 2 parts of this amazig triology- said no one ever
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,2,"More like Fifty shades of nothing happening. If I wanted to watch porn I would go to Pornhub. Writing is just really really bad, I mean she asked him 1000 times why the f... is he doing that and he gave the same answer 1000 times. Dakota needs redemption after this. It doens't even deserve that nom for Oscar."
" Beautiful!
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,10,"The best of the trilogy! The actor were a perfect match. You could feel very pain and every joy. That's also because the director had a perfect timing in nicely detailed scenes, tensed conversations. She made it a true lovestory. Made me wanted to watch the next sequels!"
" I always give the benefit of the doubt...
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,1,"I don't give one star ratings simply because I didn't like I movie. I always give the benefit of the doubt. I give ratings low because movies deserve it...and this one deserves it.Scenes don't click. The acting is atrocious. There is no building of tension and the character development is minuscule. Theses are the positive aspects of this movie.As a married man, I read the books out of curiosity. They are not bad! But the movies are absolutely horrible and a waste of time.Thankfully these were shot digitally as to not waste good celluloid..."
" It wasn't that bad
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,4,The things in the movie were so hamfisted and not subtle.Christian Grey is an abuser and a stalker. And really controlling.The actors don't have much chemistry.But the cinematrogophy looks somewhat neat. Costumes look nice.
" One of the best
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie. It has everything: love, pasion, money, desire, drama."
" Why are movies for women so poorly written?
",2018-10-26 00:00:00,1,"I, as a woman, watched this movie out of curiosity. I was never interested in it, but I want to see what the hype was about. I'm still questioning what the hype is about.So the main character Christian Grey is a young rich corporate owner, yeah how likely is that? Considering all he thinks about is sex all fricken day. They don't really elaborate on his intelligence and wit that help him create the business he owns. They could've done that in 5 minutes but whatever.Ok so let's focus on what the main story is about. The girl they picked for the story is the. absolute. WORST. Why would they pick a VIRGIN to somehow all of a sudden be interested in BDSM?? Literally she's in it for the money Mr. Grey somehow makes.Those two things could have been different, and this movie may have been a little bit better."
" Mixed feeling...
",2018-10-23 00:00:00,8,"Now, I think I should write this review. Don't know where my loyalty lies. Perchance, owes to the fact that I'm a novelist and screenwriter myself. Half my body, that is from the head to waist, says E L James should have let the original version of the screenplay come alive on screen while the other half, this is my waist to my soles, says Kelly Marcel should be thankful that the novelist, upon whose work her screenplay was based, worked on her adaptation to ensure that a 'faithful adaptation' was produced. I still don't know."
" Just awful!
",2018-10-21 00:00:00,1,"Horrible lines. Bad acting. No chemistry.They should've done a screen test of the two actors before deciding to shoot the film. Jamie Dornan is worse than Dakota in this film. Obviously, the lines are bad because of what it is based off on. But besides that, the two actors didn't showcase their acting abilities as well as they could have."
" Must be open minded to watch this movie
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,10,Fabulous... a fantastic love story... watch the complete trilogy to understand the plot...
" Great Love Story
",2018-10-07 00:00:00,10,Loved this first installment of the trilogy as the love story of Anna and Christian is born. Liked the casting and overall look of film. I recognized the book in every scene. I was not disappointed.
" Why do films like this keep getting made?
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,4,"Seriously - what is the appeal for films like this to be made? So many negative critic and user reviews. There is no romance, drama or admirable traits in the protagonists. It was a painful watch. I'm being generous with the 4/10 because I appreciate the hard work of the crew who work behind the scenes to make an earning."
" If everyone hates the film and it has a 4.1....why did it make so much money?!
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,3,"I never had any intention of watching ""Fifty Shades of Grey""...none. However, when IMDB recently revamped their Bottom 100 List and I saw the movie was now on the list, I felt I had to see it. After all, I constantly am checking out the list to see what new additions there are so I can watch them. I do occasionally like seeing a bad movie...they can be very entertaining and unintentionally funny. Now ""Fifty Shades"" is very different from any other film on the list (with the exception of ""The Last Airbender"") in that it WAS a mega-hit and lots of people liked it...though at the same time its score of 4.1 on IMDB is anemic....making it a love-hate sort of picture.Anastasia Steele (great name, huh?) is a dim sort of lady....and I'm sorry but there's no better way to describe her accurately. When she goes to interview a big-shot businessman, Christian Grey, she has no idea what she's doing, hasn't prepared in the least and asks him only banal questions. She seemed rather dull and with little personality and it was difficult to see what he saw in her. Yet, despite this, inexplicably Grey is now obsessed with her. In some ways, he seems like a nice guy--such as coming to her aid when she's drunk in a dance club soon after this meeting. But in many, he gives so many signs that he's not normal in the least...and rather creepy and possibly very dangerous. He's incredibly controlling and in response to her getting drunk he says ""If you were mine, you wouldn't be able to sit down for a week"". In other words, for getting drunk and behaving stupidly, he'd paddle the crap out of her! He then has her sign a non-disclosure agreement--saying she'll never tell anyone about him!! Soon, they are embarking on a weird S&M relationship...and that's when the film shows a lot of nekkidness, though it's of the soft-core variety. But he is clear...this is NOT love and he doesn't want to be close to anyone...and he doesn't even want to actually sleep with her...just have his way with her.What I find so bizarre about the whole ""Fifty Shades"" phenomenon is that in the 21st century, the actions of BOTH Anastasia and Christian are the exact opposite of what society is telling us folks should be like or what romance should be. There really ISN'T any romance...and he doesn't want to date her. It's not so much just the S&M aspects that I found bothersome...it's more that you have a man who dominates a woman and controls her and she is passive and does whatever he says. Her needs are also not particularly important and he wants to control every aspect of her life and breaks into her apartment when she isn't home. This is NOT the feminist idea of today...at least not what folks SAY they want in a relationship. I simply do not understand this dichotomy...nor why folks loved the books and films...yet also claim to hate them! I also worry that a film like this could set the stage for date rapes, as here in the film it's supposed to be romantic...but in real life, it could get you imprisoned. Weird.So although I found the message strange and possibly dangerous and the writing occasionally silly, what about the techincal aspects of the movie? The movie is very polished--with lovely and very appropriate music, excellent cinematography and is very artistic. For this reason alone, although I didn't like or respect the message, the film deserves more than a few stars on IMDB. I should add that although the film features a lot of nudity, I really didn't find it all that exciting to watch...mostly because the film was just creepy. It also didn't come off as sexy....just creepy. And, it probably would NOT be a great date night film...as your date might think you are...just creepy. Watch it if you'd like...I just didn't particular enjoy it nor understand WHY it made so much money...I just found it, believe it or not, to be rather dull."
" No
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,1,The biggest b......s the we have ever seen. Unbelievable nonsenses . :) Laughing out loud :)))
" Nailed it!
",2018-09-14 00:00:00,2,"One of my favorite novels has finally came on the big screen!
Well, it really was better than the novel in something:
First, it was faster and non-boring like the novel.
Second, it was absolutely more erotic.
But it wasn't an amazing movie, 'cause it had the most dumb thing in the novel:
The ending was definitely bad, I know that it was from the novel, but I didn't like it in the novel too!
Well, the cast was sometimes ridiculous!
So, Fifty Shades of Grey is such a good movie.
The things I liked as a movie was:
The cast (not beside the novel) was good, and the couple was really talented, but as a novel fan, I expected more.
The sex scenes was really erotic and romantic!
The story was lovely and fast.
That's all the things I loved and hated about this movie, and I think that the reviews was really unfair and hard on it!"
" Some intresting ideas
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,7,"I liked that scene at the end where she said oh, this is why you want to punish me? this is what this whole thing is about? and then she left and didn't let him touch her. I think that was such a brilliant scene and also the idea was so nice and also the move basically helped me understand sadomasochistic people better."
" What the hell?!
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,1,"You ruined the whole plot, that story could have been such a romantic piece! If didn't read the book you will not understand nothing about this movie! They lost all the human connections that are in the book, all the humor and the important stuff! They could have lost all the sex of the and focus more on how they met, how he invited her for coffee, or how she finds out who is Robinson, why the not touching....?! The actors don't have any chemistry at all! Because everything it is so disrupted nothing makes sense! The friendship between Kate and Anna should have been more... I don't know friendship! This movie could have been a great one, but it is just awful! If have the book don't watch this!"
" Laughable and Cheesy
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,2,"My Rating : 2/10Predictable, corny and silly.Laugh away and be mildly entertained."
" Surprisingly realistic characters
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,7,I have not read the book. This review is mostly about realism of the main characters of the movie. In some movies I notice that they really well match the logic of real life. E.g after my own divorce I noticed in some divorce-related movies that the scriptwriter certainly has observed very closely how a divorce evolves. I had similar feeling about this movie. I (a boy) was abused as a sex toy by an old woman in preschool years. Based on my experience the psychological profile of main male character seems very realistic -- yes that's the way one can feel and act after abuse -- request endless weird/cruel proofs of love and still not believe. Also the female character seemed quite realistic -- compassion was driving her into the relation with that quite weird person and at same time she had quite good ability of psychological self-protection so she resisted to falling into that abyss. Of course in the movie everything is amplified.I guess that one reason why many reviews say the movie is nonsense -- mostly people have not been in such situations (good for them). I admit the acting could be better :-)
" A film that needs to have justice done
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,7,"I don't understand where the hate against this movie comes from: if you adjust your expectations you get rewarded. To start with, it's not a piece of art, it's just another romcom, a teenager movie. And no, it's not porn, erotic scenes are very decent imho, the camera always stops before showing too much, and if someone believes teenagers nowadays would be shocked by these scenes, you don't know what you're talking about. I expected the protagonists to be lousy, yet I must confess they are convincing in their roles, and believe me I had a prejudice against them! 
I find the story be very suitable for today's young generation - in this material world obsessed with sex and false images here there are the two characters being authentic ( she is a virgin at more than twenty, no false breasts, quite common facial features, romantic, looking for the human being beyond the public image and the wealth; and him, looking for a true, ingenue and smart girl) - something unusual among the plethora of in-human movie characters. 
So if you understand every story is a form of message, this is a good story put in the form of a movie"
" Cringe galore!
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,1,"This movie had me cringe so hard, its one of the worst I have ever seen. Absolute crap! Thankfully I caught it on TV because it would have been a shame to pay for this garbage!"
" Fifty Shades of Grey
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,5,"Viewing this as a standalone movie with no underlying implications, I will say Fifty Shades was interesting to watch. But below that, the relations are beyond troubling and ridiculous, which I knock it 2 stars for. This movie, and especially the books, try and normalize rape instead of focusing on the acts consenting adults engage in. Christian is a complete control freak, and the movie was based off of a Twilight fanfiction; thus, he is Edward from Twilight, and the awkward and forced ""romance"" could hardly be more cringe-worthy."
" Sad commentary on Film today
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,1,"Luckily did not ever pay to see this 'film' but it is on cable TV often much to my shock. If ever there was a low-brow soft porno film, this is it. The acting is atrocious and wooden. Nothing really happens except the woman is abused and pilloried throughout by a nauseating man who is supposed to be sexy, but is the antithesis of it. This picture brought filmmaking to a new low. It is so sad to see films like this boring piece of rubbish when we think of the golden age of Hollywood with its wit, humor, drama, inciteful writing, direction, editing, music scoring, everything that came together to make great films. The fact they are making a third version of this sick story is unbelievable. I hope no one goes to see it. What's next, soft-core snuff? Shame on the 'actors' who portrayed these perverted characters....their careers might never recover. Minus '1' is the rating it deserves."
" I didn't like it
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,1,As a brief my rating should say more than you need.
" What was that????
",2018-06-11 00:00:00,1,"Wow what a movie! Compared to this 'the room' is a masterclass of writing, directing and acting. I only wish they could have cast Tommy Wiseau and Elizabeth Berkeley in the lead rolls and let Michael Bay write and direct. That would have been a significant improvement over this horror show of a movie. It's like they tried to make a soft porn movie but forgot to put the porn in. If you want a good laugh it's worth a look but as a movie it ranks amongst the worst ever made"
" Not bad but not great
",2018-06-08 00:00:00,7,I did not read the book so I had no high expectations and thought it was ok.
" Porn?
",2018-04-27 00:00:00,1,"Just could watch few minutes. There is tons of movies which leave deep feeling even after several days past. Unfortunately, commercially controlled brains brought millions to this kind of porn."
" Glorifying mental abuse
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,1,"It's very sad that this movie glorify mental abuse, and takes back the image of the women a hundred years."
" People who rate bad miss the point
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,10,"I love this movie serie. I have watched them all and also read the books. The movies is so much better without the many detailed sex scenes. What is best With the movie serie is about the story of Christian Grey. Why he is a sadist, How Ana makes him a better person, able to feel love and enjoy life. I love the chemistry between the caracters, even though the chemistry between the actors could be better. I have seen it many Times, just for the feeling of this complicated relationship"
" Simply ruined by the ending...!!
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,1,"I saw the rating of the movie is very bad, but still everyone talking about this movie like a good one. That was the first reason why I decided to watch the movie. And the second was pretty 'Dakota Johnson'. By the way the movie was really intense to me for the eagerness of what will be next, like will he make her as his girlfriend and become a nice person like she ever wanted? going to be a forever happy one? etc. I almost felt like she conquered 80% of him and kept it going to 100%. But tragically the last 15 mins changed everything and spoiled the soothing pace of the movie. She gave up on him, and gone from his apartment because of things that never meant to be happened. Even though something horribly happened, I had a faith like any other viewer that he sooner or later showed up in front of her and beg for her love and apologize for his peculiar conduct. But the odds are favored at the end, like nothing happened and they were separated for a life time I guess! The author may be an intelligent person but I wonder, what kind of intellect was that at the end that he made. Couldn't the authors be a normal person and think like a normal person?"
" Depressing. Boring (in no particular order)
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,1,"The first 15 minutes of the movie is the best part: it is the part when you anticipate something great. But that something never happens...unless all you wanted was to look at a couple naked.
I finished watching this film while multitasking...i finished it only because i'm trying to understand why women gladly support the financial survival of this piece of art.
If you feel like risking time go ahead, but don't say I didn't warn you.
There was no tension, nothing to keep the viewers interested."
" ' Roll your eyes at me again and I will put you across my knee!'
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,7,"Though a few years late in viewing this immensely popular film and not having read E.L. James series of novels on dominant and submissive sexual experiences, the 'better late than never' applies. No, this is not a 'great movie' but as adapted for the screen by Kelly Marcel it is entertaining (though a bit long) and it is cast with credible appearing characters (the central focus couple spends the better part of the 125 minute film without clothes and pushing the usual standards of X rated to the limits - almost). Sam Taylor - Johnson, the British female director manages the situation well. Shy literature student Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) rooms with the worldly Kate (Eloise Mumford) and goes to interview the wealthy Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) as a favor to Kate who is to interview Grey for the school paper. She encounters a beautiful, brilliant and intimidating man. The innocent and naive Ana starts to realize she wants him. Despite his enigmatic reserve and advice, she finds herself desperate to get close to him. Not able to resist Ana's beauty and independent spirit, Christian Grey admits he wants her too, but on his own terms. Ana hesitates as she discovers the singular tastes of Christian Grey - despite the embellishments of success, his multinational businesses, his vast wealth, and his loving family, Grey is consumed by the need to control everything. He gradually introduces (? seduces) into the realm of submission and dominance - and the film ends with a cliffhanger that guarantees the continuation of James' novel. Johnson and Dornan have fine chemistry and make the affaire noir credible. The others in the cast who contribute well are Jennifer Ehle (Ana's mother), Marcia Gay Harden (Christian's mother) and bit parts by Victor Rasuk, Max Martin and Luke Grimes among others.Be prepared for a lot of visual body contact - but of course everyone knows the story and its reason for being because of all the flutter about James' novels."
" Half my brain is missing thanks to this movie.
",2018-03-07 00:00:00,1,"When it comes to the best selling book, 50 Shades of Gray, I was never familiar with it nor did I ever read it, I only became aware of the movie after I saw a trailer of it and I had no interest in seeing it due to it's content. So late last year, I plucked up courage and sat down to watch 50 Shades of Gray and I absolutely despised it. From it's piss-poor writing and uncomfortable sex scenes to it's god-awful acting, this is easily the worst movie I have ever seen.The story begins with a collage girl named Anastasia Steele who goes to interview billionaire Christian Gray when her roommate is unable to go. Upon arriving at his office, Anastasia fumbles her way though the interview but Gray takes a shine to her. After she leaves, he stakes her at her job and soon begins to shower her with gifts and she attends a photo-shoot with him. Later on, Gray attempts to get Ana to sigh an agreement to stop her from telling anyone about their love affair and tells her that he only has relationships that involve bondage defined by a contract. What follows in Ana being Gray's sex slave while Christian's more interesting side comes into play.This day in age, some people no longer understand what acceptable or excellent is but instead settling on uninspired and consider that great and the benchmark for what movies and filmmaking should be and it sadly seems that even something as wretched and foul as 50 Shades of Garbage can't even be considered dull but rather just laughably bad as there are people who have praised this movie for the actors and for being so romantic, something I clearly didn't see. While I have never read the book, it seems that a lot of people who have read it hated it as in order for the reader to like it, they needed to use their intelligence. The successfulness of the book is established in its fictional viewpoints and while imagination can provide a person with certain feelings than most other things, the movie certainly doesn't live up to what it promises even for the most idiotic minds, let alone somebody with a wildly gifted mind. The only desire the movie will grant you is how quick you can rush out of the theater or how fast you can turn off your TV.As somebody who against sexual abuse including BDSM, every time Christian and Ana are on screen making love, it made me groan in pain and was gut-wrenching to watch. The failure of the screenwriter to develop the sexual relationship between these two is nothing short of appalling and while Christian may appear to be every woman's dream man but instead molests a young woman simply because he had issues with his own mother and is committed to using abuse to get what he wants rather than actually having a relationship with Ana who seems to have no sexual fondness until she meets Christian and yet willfully goes along with anything he asks her to do even if it means her getting abused just shows me how sick and perverted this movie truly is.If you read an actual romance book like Outlander, the lead is somber and disturbed for reasons that have significance and ability and is someone who commands admiration, not expect it just because they're a rich playboy and who has already shown themselves in ways that consist of pain, blood and jeopardy, not by pushing women to have sex with him though bullying tactics. How E.L. James was able to take a moronic Twilight fan fiction and turn that into a best selling series then into a movie franchise is beyond me. A 26 year old tycoon and a shy collage girl who feels the need to say oh my every few minutes, seriously?! Is this what writing from a woman's perspective has become?! Great job on that one, Kelly Marcel. Of course, there have been people who have watched the movie or read the book who have disregarded that throughout the movie, there is molestation, non consensual lovemaking and lots of physical, spoken and emotional abuse where Christian beats, spanks, hits and bullies Ana and he even controls every aspect of her life from the food she eats to how long she sleeps and yet shows not even a crumb of love for her. What kind of person would do something like that?! In fact, I would so far to call Christian and Ana just might be the worst on-screen couple since Edward and Bella.As for the script, it's a complete joke, something that would have been laughed off the Lifetime Channel. The dialog is easily the worst I've ever heard spoken in a feature film. In fact, the movie seems to be adrift in whatever time period it is as there are times throughout the movie where certain words are used in a certain way that is intended to come across as edgy and outrageous but it instead comes across as pathetic while the character growth is non-existent which is made even more laughable because the two leads have zero on-screen chemistry which left me not caring about either one of them nor are they interesting in any capacity. Yeah, Gray's taste in women may be seen as appealing to some but it comes across as repulsive. For the viewer to become attached to a lead in a movie, it has to be because he or she is charismatic or has a backstory that is interesting or makes us feel for them, things Bela Lugosi in Dracula has because people find him compelling and not because of him being a vampire but because he's a man with a past along with actual individuality and charm while Christian Gray is a bland and blank slate devoid of any personality or charisma.The performances are just as bad, but not even Leonardo DiCaprio and Cate Blanchett could have worked with such horrible dialog, and while Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dorian are god-awful in their roles, a lot of that can be attested to director Sam Taylor-Johnson's lifeless directing and the fact that the two leads didn't like working with each other. Dakota is far from convincing as Anastasia and comes across as a vapid and weak woman who needs a man to be with her at all times and Johnson fails at playing the part while Dorian comes across as an overbearing, creepy and unlikable moron who can't seem to be able to smile throughout the entirety of the film but instead uses the same idiotic, overly-somber facial movements for the duration of the movie. All the supporting characters are equally pointless and uninteresting.The one great thing about this mess of celluloid is the photography and aerial shots; they look spectacular particularly the in-fight shots of Seattle or when Ana and Christian are flying, but apart from that, 50 Shades of Gray is not worth watching, I beg you, please do not go see this movie. Your brain and soul will thank you for it. In fact, watching paint dry would be more entertaining then watching this movie."
" Terrible.
",2018-03-02 00:00:00,1,"Terrible, although these actors' careers are not over as the box office made a fortune."
" Fifty Shades of Grey has sex...that's about it.
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,2,"I cannot believe I actually watched this. Me, who solemnly swore he wouldn't watch such rubbish, made the bold choice to watch this for the sake of his friend. That's how kind I am. I would succumb to this for friendship. Honestly though, this has less substance than a used condom. I'm not even going to summarise the ""plot"", because there was hardly any. Young girl falls in love with rich man who creates a contract for some submissive dominance relationship thing. I don't know, and I don't care. The film is shot well atleast, and has aesthetic appeal. Don't forget the hardcore foreplay and rough sex...oh wait, it's tame? Oh dear. I've seen more convincing sex (and better plot) in a 70's soft porno. The screenplay can be best described as monotonous. Example: ""I don't make love. I f*ck...hard"". Or even: ""Because I'm fifty shades of f*cked up, Anastasia"". What even was this!? Have we, the human race, actually come to this!? I can't comprehend the stupidity of this dialogue and how undramatic it was. The most excitement I had was attempting to work out the word for a 'vagina wig' which I'm sure Dakota Johnson was wearing. ""Hmmm I know it sounds like mankini? No wait, I'll FaceTime my mum, she'll know...MERKIN! It's a merkin!"". The sex, which the plot clearly revolves around, is too funny to watch. Whips, chains, rope...we got it all, and it's hilarious. Then the accompaniment of generic pop songs, oh yes it gets better. Bursting into Ellie Goulding's ""Love Me Like You Do"" has never felt so good. Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan were abysmal, not their fault though to be fair. Goes to show that a screenplay is the most central and important aspect to a captivating film. And captivating this is not. However, my life is now complete. This film brought me joy. It is so atrocious that I actually loved it. Get ready for when I watch the sequel, I can't wait..."
" Read the book instead!!
",2018-02-25 00:00:00,1,"If you've read the book, this movie does not do it justice. If you just watch the film, you'll wonder what the hype was all about. Disappointing."
" In my top 3 worst movies EVER
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,1,"This movie is SO unbelievably cringe that it's almost unbearable to watch, that's all there is to say about it."
" Meh...
",2018-02-08 00:00:00,1,"I had zero expectations, before watching it, based on all the shitty reviews.Dakota Johnson is actually pretty with a very nice body. And I enjoyed seeing her naked alot. Since it's not possible to give zero stars on imdb anyway, that one star goes to her body. The acting is not as horrible as I expected. But certainly not impressive either. There is chemistry between the two leads. Why people say there isnt any, I dont know. The movie is not PG13 either as I expected it to be. Having finally seen Fifty shits of crap, I can understand why women enjoy this. As a man however I was pretty bored.Why Anastasia put up with Christians behaviour and the way he treats her, his BDSM-needs and pretty much everything else is hard to believe.Anastasia being a virgin, when meeting Christian (even though she's an american) is also hard to believe. Her not knowing what butt plugs are and appearently having never watched porn either, is also unbelievable.Those scenes where he gets mad about her visiting her parents and actually follows her there, would have made any sane woman break up with him. Just as the ridicoulus contract as well as him saying he will pretend to be her boyfriend one night per week. What the hell is his problem?? Yeah, yeah Ive read about his troubled childhood and the woman who had him as a BDSM slave for 6 years. But that does not justify Christian being a complete asshole to Anastasia. Why women would be turned on by someone treating ther that way, I have no idea. But Anastasia does put up with it. Untill the very end of the movie anyway. Where he whips her ass cheecks six times and she suddenly has had enough and leaves him. She puts up with his dominant abusive attitude during the entire film, but him whipping her is appearently too much?? 
 
Avoid this unless youre a dumb middle aged housewife, that finds this more interesting than actual porn. No men should ever watch it. Not even to please their girlfriends or wifes."
" Boooring
",2018-02-07 00:00:00,1,"Two years later I found this movie surfing channels on TV (I avoided seeing it at the time it was released because of bad reviews about both film and the book).They were absolutely right... It was sooooo boring, I fell asleep. 
Nothing interesting happened.
It never caught me at all.It's useless to write anythng else. A forgettable flick."
" I could deal with the SM, but not with the male lead
",2018-02-03 00:00:00,2,"This movie seemed preposterous to me. I mean, I've got no problem with the idea that some people are turned on by being dominant, even by inflicting pain, and I'm equally O.K. with the idea that others might be turned on by being submissive, or even (though more rarely) from receiving pain. But I can't get my head around the idea that a beautiful, sexy, smart, interesting woman like Anastasia (as portrayed by Dakota Johnson) would have any interest at all in a mindless, boring, selfish, cardboard cutout of a man like Christian. He has money. Great. That's always a plus. But is having money really enough to make up for his utter lack of any discernable personality? I don't understand what would motivate this woman to do anything she does."
" An attempt to normalise perversion.
",2018-01-24 00:00:00,1,"I find it extremely hard to believe that we live in a society that tolerates such films. Not only tolerates : people pay money to see them. What are the potential consequences? How many women's masochistic tendencies will be reinforced by films like these? Have we lost it, collectively ?"
" Garbage.
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,1,4 stars is way too high. I feel it is my social responsibility to help lower this rating. Awful.
" I Put A Spell On You
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,2,"People talk like this is the worst movie ever made, like it's some Ed Wood Plan 9 fiasco. Well, it's a very bad movie all right. But it's not that bad. Can you really hate a movie that starts with a sexy cover version of Screaming Jay Hawkins' ""I Put A Spell On You"" over the opening titles? I mean, Creedence Clearwater Revival covered that song. It's Fifties rock, and it's the real deal! (Idea for a movie: John Fogerty plays a beloved sixty-something rock legend who has a secret side as a pain-inflicting Dom! They call him the Midnight Choogler . . .)Anyway, this movie is horrible, but not because there's too much brutal violence or hardcore sex. It's just that Master Grey, the handsome boy billionaire who like to tie women up and punish them, lacks all human personality and is a totally lifeless character. Fifty Shades is not a real romance, because there is no romantic hero. There's just an empty suit.See, when you read a real romance, like OUTLANDER by Diana Gabaldon, the hero is dark and tortured for reasons that have weight and stature. He's a guy who commands respect from everyone, not just one impressionable young girl. He's a guy who has already proved himself in ways that involve real blood, sweat, and danger. If someone's going to spank a young girl, it ought to be someone who knows something about pain. A brawler with a broadsword, a warrior from a proud people, not some faceless billionaire who pushes buttons. Fifty Shades fails because this Grey guy is just not an interesting person. His sexual tastes may be interesting, or shocking, but other than that, so what? Think about Bela Lugosi in the original Dracula. Women find him fascinating for reasons that have nothing to do with his vampire nature. Like when they ask him about fixing up his new home, Carfax Abbey, and he says, ""I shall do very little repairing. It reminds me of the broken battlements of my own castle, in Transylvania."" Dracula is a man with a past, a real identity, real allure. Christian Grey is banal, empty, as lifeless as the models last year's fashion magazines. I keep wanting to say that Dakota Johnson was great as Anastasia. She was, but only because the script actually gives her something to work against. Oh, and I love the fact that her blonde roommate turns out to be nice and not killed at the end."
" Worst. Movie. Ever.
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,1,"The two most wasteful hours of my life. I watched it because I was curious; needless to say, I no longer am. The only tolerable parts of the movie were the sex scenes because at least there were no poor, stilted attempts at conversation. I can't believe that anyone ever enjoyed this."
" A lot of passionate
",2018-01-20 00:00:00,8,"Fifty shades of Grey is a drama about a love story of literature student Anastasia Steele and rich businessman Cristian Grey. This film is directed by Sam-Taylor Johnson. The story based on the first part of the popular erotic trilogy «Fifty shades of Grey». which is written by E.L.James. The main characters are played by Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan. 
The plot is extremely passionate and fascinating. Young women fall in love with a mad businessman, who has problems with aggression and doesn't trust people. Anastasia want help him, but she must make an effort to do this.
The film is worse than book because of the fact that script isn't written by E.L.James, but the cast is excellent. Leading actors play completely realistic, especially in sexual scenes. 
I would recommend it because the story is truly interesting and if you didn't watch it, you wouldn't understand the sequel, which's script is written be E.L.James and it's fantastic. To sum up i want to say that Fifty shades of Grey was a box-office hit."
" Fifty Shades of Grey Review
",2018-01-08 00:00:00,5,Never read the books but my wife wanted to watch it so we did and it wasn't too bad of a movie. Entertaining enough for me to agree to watch the second and third once it comes out
" The Room ver 2
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,1,"This movie, from the storyline like from a dreaming girl about sex life with a great rich man, doesn't make sense, jumping from here and there with nonsense things."
" Fascinating movie that will liberate something in you
",2017-12-22 00:00:00,8,"Somehow I had to see this movie as I picked it up by intuition in the local library. It was full moon the night I watched it...and boy it was powerful! 
The story gripped me and I could feel the fear, lust and passion during the sexual scenes. This is not a movie about an SM relationship however...it is much more in my opinion. Especally when you watch the sequel '50 Shades Darker' and upcoming '50 Shades Freed' (february 2018).Let me explain; I did a little research on the Internet and it somehow puzzled me that both the movie and the books had very bad reviews. While at the same time from the books more than 100 million copies have been sold Worldwide! It was a real hype at the time. So what is going on? 
My take on it is that somehow the author had the genius to connect with a deep collective wound that resides in all of us: sexual abuse and repression. You only have to look at the statistics; 30/ 40 % of women sexually abused...smaller percentages with men. And history books that are full of plundering gangs and armies....killing the men and raping the women. I could feel the struggle and growing strength in Anastasia when she was torn between love and the feeling that the abuse was not Okay! 
And without spoil anything for new viewers...something of love continued, and the promise of the 3th movie ""50 Shades Freed"" tells you where it is going. And maybe if you watch these three movies you will just like me experience some liberation from this deep rooted wound, and feel more free and trusting in your own sexual relationship. 
Looking forward to the 3th movie for sure!"
" I quite liked it
",2017-10-23 00:00:00,6,"Finally, being a straight male and therefore not in the market for the traditional girls night out, I watched this surreptitiously on TV a few days ago. I have not read any of the books so am judging the film purely on its own merits. OK, so yes it is far too long and the BDSM element is vastly over- hyped, being extremely tame by present-day standards. But for me it does have some erotic charge in the ""will they, won't they, what will they do?"" sort of way. And the two leads are undoubtedly attractive (Dakota Johnson in my case). Dakota is very well cast. What is curious about the whole thing is that it is really just an old- fashioned rich boy meets poor(ish) girl romance that could have been made 60 years ago. Perhaps that is what others mean when they say the script is clunky. So in all, not a triumph, but not a turkey either."
" Wasn't that bad
",2017-10-08 00:00:00,7,"The movie wasn't near as bad as all these reviews seem to be making it out to be. Get over yourselves people. And to all the people saying Dakota Johnson is ""plain""... Ya know, not every guy likes a spray tanned plastic painted whore. Some of us prefer the nice girl next door look. And if you seriously are saying you didn't think she was hot in the movie, you are just deluding yourself. It's not the best movie I've ever seen, but it wasn't that damn bad. Geez."
" Bland tripe just not worthy
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,2,"I had heard so much about this movie (and book) that expectations were high. Wrong! Its quite simple. A movie will entertain, make you laugh , cry get turned on. This movie did none of the above. So much hype for such a sad piece of garbage. So this totally filthy rich dude thinks he can pick up a female and get exactly what he wants. The female protagonist is not so ready to give over to his good looks and grand bank account. This would never happen in real life. If a multi millionaire with super hero looks approached just about any woman she would bend over backwards (literally) to satisfy him. Not so this average looking virgin. Sorry the whole thing smacks of Hollywood over-hype tripe rubbish. Don't bother. Oh by the way the acting is bad the female is not sexy even totally naked. 'A' bust little boy chest? Really? They could have at least tried!"
" Just an OK movie
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,5,"Where do I begin? Lets start with the good stuff... Firstly there is the music score by Danny Elfman gets a big stamp of approval.(barely). Secondly, Cimentogrphy by Seamus McGarvey was fantastic and beautiful. And lastly, the over all Style of the film with production design was sleek. So what was the issue. It is in my opinion:CONTROL: the author E.L. James massive ego killed it for me. It is very difficult to translate a book to film successfully but it can be done. Schindler's List, Gorilla's in the Mist, The Great Gatsby, Silence of the Lambs and Atonement to name a few. But with this film it's did not come across. And this is a prime example of the author, E.L. James having too much control on the source material. Whenever the film tries to be a movie because somethings in novels cannot be translated into a visual medium, E.L.James practically chokes it back to a novel format. Slap my forehead, Fifty Shades has the full symptoms of The Phantom Menace. We've seen this happen with George Lucas controlling influences and his team of ""yes"" peopleCASTING: the two main leads Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornam; two good looking people who ""should"" have and can act. But in Fifty Shades of Grey they both look like this is their first acting job. There was no soul or believable in the characters of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. So it comes down to casting. If the leads are right..like Clarke Gable and Vivien Leigh in Gone With The Wind..the film can be good. And sometimes exception, for example, Lord Of the Ring trilogy.WRITING (SCRIPT). The story is very simplistic. Boy meets girl. Fall in love and they go through the tribulations of a relationship. But likes kinky stuff, girl doesn't like it but she has hit the jackpot. She has successfully nabbed a billionaire. So she goes along with it. Script is so bad that a 5 year old could of written it better. And it has E.L. James in the writing credits. A middle age woman with no previous experience as a film writer. There are parts where you get the feeling something is right, or important information for the audience are glossed over. Scenes that need further exploration are abruptly ended. Dialogue is stiff and goes into the territory of...oh God help us...yep...Daytime television. CHARACTERS:. Ana is poorly develops, weak and needs a man to rescue her. She has no ambitions a of a modern woman, no driving force that motivates her to follow her destiny. NOTHING!!! No interest, no hobbies, no backbone. Christian JUST is dull and boring. A handsome man with absolutely no real character arc. Is he arrogant? NO Is he an interesting person? NO Does he go through life changing events in the movie which affect him and Ana, he grows and become a different person. But do we get this on screen. NOPE the audience has been ripped off. Christain is the same person as he is in the beginning. Think about, what truly changed him as a character, what event categorically changed the fundamentally of this character. And there it is again, what were all the characters motivations in this movie? Sadly all the characters lacked connectivity with the audience and came across as fake.I don't want to trash Fifty Shades of Grey like many critics and reviewers, because honestly, we've seen worst. I will say this is an OK movie not a masterpiece."

",2017-09-25 00:00:00,1,"My god. I've never experienced so many strong emotions while watching a movie. The first act had me bored as all hell, the second act had me laughing in my seat when I really shouldn't have been, and the last act had me horrified. What will Hollywood think of next?0/10"
" My eyes ... oh God my eyes
",2017-09-25 00:00:00,1,"Have you ever watched a film which leaves you with physical actual pain ( no pun intended believe me ) i did and its fifty shades of Grey . It was bad not in a normal kind of way , it was highly revolting and yet and if watched by the group of prankster friends ( like i did ) was an unintentional comedy. Mind you it was still annoyingly bad. A retarded woman goes to see Norman Bates wanna be and falls in love with him. He beats her and tells her he cant love her but will sexually, emotionally and physically hurt her she stays long enough to receive the flogging of her life then runs a way. The end"
" Who thought this was a good idea?
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,1,"FIFTY SHADES OF GREY is a film every bit as bad as you've heard. The screen adaptation of the best-selling erotic novel exploring the topic of bondage, you can tell this started out as a piece of Internet fan fiction, based on the TWILIGHT saga, that became inexplicably popular. It's like a cheesy Mills & Boon romance with some unexpectedly dark subject matter involving violence against women, and yet some women seem to get a kick out of this. I don't see why.As a film, this is a dog. Badly-scripted by someone with a tin ear for natural-sounding dialogue, and with embarrassingly wooden performances from the two leads. The much-hyped sex scenes feature extensive nudity and lots of athletic moments, but not once is any of it erotic or appealing. Instead it feels cheap, tawdry, and rather sleazy. I can't believe they've made sequels, either."
" Simply Awful - Spoilers
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,1,"It's not because you're in your 20s and still a virgin that you're a child in your head. She's so naive, an eight year old would understand more about sex and relationships today than her. Then, you expect some sensual light porn, thinking that might compensate for the lack of of everything else, but it never comes. You barely see anything in Grey's red room. It's just disappointing."
" A beautiful love story
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,10,I was convinced that this movie was going to be good. The quality is magnificent and the actors have a great load of sex- appeal. Not to mention that the movie was better than the book. The ending is almost tragic and it shows that the relationship wasn't going to work due to Grey's difficult behavior. Just hoping that the next movies will have happy endings.
" Inconsistent Rubbish
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,3,"Where to begin on this movie. I could rattle off mistakes and errors as long as a Torah and they'd be all to do with this one movie but to save people and me the time I'm just gonna name a few. Casting , directing , plot , overall pre film hype and the list goes on and on and on. Starting with casting I do think that people have been a little more than critical sometimes in Rita Ora's role of Mia Grey as I think more screen time would have been more of a true reflection to judge her character to see how she faired on screen as it's not easy mastering a different art form different to your preferred profession (just look at Cara Delevigne before she did Valerian) and where they decided to cast Dakota Johnson as Anastasia Steele came from I don't know. I have seen actors/actresses play worse parts (like Abigail Breslin playing Baby in a Dirty Dancing remake) and that I don't believe really is her fault as a performer you can only take a role so far. The plot of the film comes as this mysterious rich good looking man of many talents that has many secrets he doesn't tell. It's not a terrible movie and it's target audience probably isn't aimed towards me or most men in particular but from a reviewers point of view it could be better. Casting 4/10- Jamie Dornan slowly and transitionally looked he was still finding the role as an actor and was good in places but a wrong casting with Dakota Johnson. Plot 2/10- No real love story to the piece. Mainly focuses on domination and erotic scenes which might have been it's aim but possibly I thought it was more of a love story theme as a genre. Pre-film hype 3/10- It was successful in the box office so it's doing something right but mainly a film that reaches a target audience of the female gender."
" Even after all the bad reviews decided to give it a try! And it was worth it!
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,8,"I read a lot of bad reviews about this movie and at first I was very skeptical about it. But then, I decided to watch it anyway. It is important to mention I did not read the book so basically I have no reference and nothing to compare to.And all I need to say is I love the movie. It is not perfect but I really enjoyed watching it. I found it super hot, sexy, romantic and full of sex! Yes, it is full of sex and I loved it. And it is not like the porn type of sex. It is way very artistically and the cameras simply did a great job. It is the beautiful type of sex.The acting was very realistic as well. It was cute and funny. I would say imperfect. And that's what made it special on my point of view. It approached reality like it should be. I would surely recommend this movie but just keep in my it won't be as all the Hollywood movies. It will be something else."
" As bad as you probably heard everybody say about it
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,5,"A normal and shy girl gets to interview a very wealthy man and soon after, against all expectations, they start dating. Their relationship is very far away from being normal, as he is a very difficult character with many necessities and desires, as she'll soon find out. Due to his posture and financial position, he's able to offer very expensive and diverse gifts but in return, he demands complete obedience and loyalty, even coming up with a contract regarding their private life, with many clauses which are to be respected by both parts. Although she seems happy on the outside, she was expecting more from this relationship and the aspects she's about to find about her partner will prove to be questionable, to say the least.It's a movie which had an interesting premise, of a normal poor girl which enters an unexpected relationship with a person who's out of her league, but soon gains a stereotypical course of events which seems to come directly from a soap opera. They fight, make up using one of his expensive gifts, fight again and so on. Nothing interesting happens and the interest which was present in the beginning soon fades away. Unfortunately, much more disappointing than the main part of the movie is the finale, which ends abruptly, without any warning or logic. I can understand when the producers of a movie want to create suspense for a sequel but this is exaggerated. It ends just like a soap operaAs an overall thought, I'm pretty much disappointed about every aspect of this movie, except the soundtrack which is simply astonishing. I didn't like the actors, I didn't like the plot and I certainly didn't like the finale."
" Whatever it is, it's awkward all the way.
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,3,"I saw so many low reviews here, then I just finished watching it, I feel the urge to justify what I just watched.I've never read the book, never felt that I have to watch this whatsoever, I do have friends active in dungeon scenes and BDSM but this movie is not related to any of the hardcore stuff at all, and no inspiration at all. This movie is not ""legit"" BDSM, not legit ""porn"", not legit ""obscure poetry"", not legit ""Love Story"". It's just a piece of AWKWARD patchwork.Basically it's a story of a newly graduated girl who's virgin to love and to sex and fell for a rich okay-looking guy who has issues expressing true emotions cos of childhood trauma and blah blah blah, and he thinks BDSM is his way-out.Basically that's it. What makes me think the whole movie is an award patchwork is that.. 1. In the beginning they fell for each other super quickly by simply staring at each other All The Time(that explained why people feel both leads acting quite poorly). There's no clue or reason why he/she? Because she's stupid/pretty/naive??? because he is the only successful sorta okay-looking young biz man left? Nothing suggested in the beginning, nor later. Just leave audience like what??!! (so this is the flattest way you could to interpret love at first sight) And where does that emotional attachment between two characters that director you try to build come from??2. If people are looking forward to some steamy scenes, and/or take a glimpse to BDSM, this movie is way too disappointing. The movie amplified Anastasia's(played by Dakota Johnson) nervousness, naivety, fear and Trying, to boost Grey's(played by Jamie Dornan) S/M behaviors. And it turned out no emotional calls to the audience, no real steamy actions appeared to empower the dark theme the audience may have wished to be surprised...There are way more European erotic movies and/or porn at least provide the sensation, sometimes even knowledge. Not even European erotic movies, one French movie called Les Regrets, it's about two people in their 40s fell for each other, sex scenes in that was even more appealing and enjoyable than this one. 3. Details in the movie, lives of 2 leads and so forth, seemed super redundant. Some reviews here said Grey is a stalker, but hey some boys/girls love to show up to give the other half surprise. The problem is the pacing of the normal life scenes were shot so boring and so flat(there's no powerful punch in this movie that make the audience care) No point, no connections in details themselves. Anastasia's mom and dad have no function and no inspiration in this movie. Their roles could have been deleted. Grey's suit and demeanor are so stiff that it confused me if the actor's acting really bad or the character is stiff in such a horribly boring way. I felt Dakota Johnson was trying to play a poor lovely girl and it was okay to me but I wished the director and male lead could have been different. It's just an awkward patchwork."
" The movie seems like a steamy fantasy of a master of English literature.
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,6,"I haven't read the novel so I can't compare the movie with the book. The movie seems like a steamy fantasy of a master of English literature. Perhaps it is a fantasy of the author herself. Is it coincidence the protagonist is a graduating English Literature major? Ana Steele (Dakota Johnson) is a graduating college students whose roommate has an interview with 27-year-old billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Drnan). The roommate becomes sick and Ana offers to go in her place. Christian and Ana are instantly attracted, and the next day, Christian visits Ana at work. One night, Ana is out and gets drunk. Christian arrives to her rescues, taking a passed out Ana back to his place. He doesn't take advantage of her and the two begin a relationship, which seems normal at first. In a romantic comedy style, the morning after their first real night together, Ana makes breakfast in a button down shirt, complete with ""Beast of Burden"" by the Stones playing. They are comically interrupted by an unexpected visit from Christian's mother. Soon, Christian reveals his true colors. He's controlling and wants a dominant relationship, particularly when the lights go out, although he's completely open about it—so open he wants Ana to sign a contact, submitting to his desires. This is not new to Christian. He tells Ana she is #16. Ana struggles with the decision to sign the contract, while struggling with her feelings towards Christian. Christian struggles with his own emotions as he tries to woo Ana into signing the contract. Truly a steamy thriller, but different then what's out there. It starts off slow but it is necessary for character development. The producers must've had fun with the MPAA board to keep the rating at R and not NC-17. Clearly the target audience is women, but it's cerebral enough that a guy can appreciate it."
" I can relate to the girl, but can't understand the man
",2017-06-26 00:00:00,8,"I heard friends' spoilers about the movie and thought the story was awful, and I thought I would be much smarter if I were in such a situation.Recently I watched the film, and I take back my words. I can now understand why two of my friends (one girl and one guy in their late 20s) told me it was plotted in such a natural way and things looked normal in that situation.The woman was spotted by the guy for a reason. She looked intimidated and submissive in the first few encounters. She admires him. She is attractive. These gave him the wrong impression that she can be used as his sexual slave. Hence the contract and everything that has nothing to do with love were brought into the scene at the early stage, and their relationship was based on simply sex and probably material rewards, not much to the girl's satisfaction.She knew it was dangerous but she was also attracted to him, maybe in her heart she likes to be the submissive, to a certain extent. His pursuit has been contradictory which makes her want to know more. There were multiple times she retreated, but the sweeteners he gave (imagine how many girls have been taken onto airplane journeys by their dates), his persistent pursuit and the nearly overwhelming care have melted her. And not to forget, he did give her a romantic first night. For him, it was simply to ""rectify the situation"", but for her, he was the first guy she has ever wanted to have a romance with. She was led on by desire but their relationship seemed to went too far on sex but not on other aspects. I knew it will die soon. Interestingly, despite the man had shown it clear at the beginning that he does not do romance, his feelings for her grew deeper and her refusals at certain points have wakened him up to realize he wanted to fight for her. It is not easy at all. Considering his history of being sexually abused by an older woman who even became his friend, sexual abuse was considered normal and enjoyable to him, so their conflicts are intensified as their relationship became acknowledged by people around them before themselves even knew where they were.Overall, it was a relationship based on physical attraction later became serious and problems got intensified. I relate to this girl strongly that when a young girl is innocent, curious and loving, she would not know what it means and how it feels to be with this seemingly perfect guy without trying. When she tried to say no it was also difficult because he did not give her a break and he looked perfect by other people's eyes. On the other hand, it was a bit hard to understand the man, partly because the long abusive sexual relationship he had in his childhood. The male actor did not make the character stand out probably also because the role is hard for him to relate to."
" Nice movie
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,8,"It's a good movie.The plot is interesting.The storyline is engaging and the production quality is spot on.Even the sex scenes are great, although we don't have much of that in the movie.The soundtrack is particularly awesome.I love the camera angles in the movie as well as the ending.It was a nice movie that got me thinking about it for days.If you had not read the book, I'd definitely recommend this movie.Great movie."
" Expected more
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,5,"Heard from few females about this movie, said it was so.... wonderful, so perfect. I wonder what's so perfect about it? The strange virgin girl that falls in love with a guy who told her damn straight that he's not interested in romance and just have that urge to whack her before each sex act. FOr me this is not just stupid, but it saddens me that such people can really exist and that someone even approves that and find it ""perfect/romantic/thrilling"" (facepalm). Other than this stupidness i find strange how some people are bad at understanding what they're being told, as we see the actress gets very upset when getting whacked too hard even though everything was explained clear as day what to expect (facepalm). Of course it is so romantic to give your virginity to someone who doesn't need relationship, than to find that prince that loves you all his live (that photographer for example). I really can't understand how women can like this movie? It goes against everything that they so much value, or are they just lying to us (wouldn't be very much surprised). Everything else in the movie is tolerable and the rating it has 4.1 is very much deserved"
" Incredibly boring
",2017-06-02 00:00:00,3,"Well. That was a waste of time. They sold a lot of tickets based on the book's reputation, but I would have walked out of the theater after the first 39 minutes. It is that boring. Bad acting, slow pace, just plain uninteresting. I watched it online out of curiosity as to how it could have such a low rating. Now I know. If you see an IMDb rating of 4.1, just say no. Walk away. Go watch the grass grow or paint dry. You'll be more entertained."
" Best love story of this generation
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,10,"The books and movies are empowering to woman not Degrading to them!A lots of people seems to have so many problems with the books saying it's trash, or simply saying it's straight up abuse! which are nothing but lies or course! This is a passionate love story about two damaged but not entirely broken souls. Who find love and strength in each other."
" Kept me interested
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,10,"I never read the book but I may soon. I heard a lot of hype about the book and never saw the movie. Now, two years later I decided to watch it on cable t.v. Today was my second time watching it. The reason why I liked it is the reality of him and her and how couples play games with each other in real life. I liked their chemistry a lot and of course, I loved the ending the best! I look forward to reading the book and watching the second movie, which is out in 2 days. Perhaps women look at this as a fantasy but to me, I liked her strength and I'm sure it was not easy for her to do what she did. I'll probably watch it again. Christian Grey is handsome and he reminds me of an old friend who looks like him when he was his age."
" Beyond awful
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,1,"He had to tie her up to keep her from running away from this movie. I wonder if they tied the audience to their seats to keep them from running away? This movie is beyond stupid. Who knew a twenty-something college graduate could be so incredibly gullible. Thank god I didn't actually pay to see this ""drama"" in a theater. On the other hand it does put you to sleep in a rather gentle way without drugs. I wonder why she never tied up Mr. S & M man? It would have made a more interesting movie."
" well they could have done better with it.
",2017-04-28 00:00:00,4,"The plot is interesting in essence and within itself wants to promote a fight between love, social propriety and lust, unfortunately the acting was uninspired, and the script never lead you deep enough to believe in the characters.The film counted on an nonexistent 'edge' to keep us interested as it gravitated to and from the control freak billionaire's all too politically correct behavior and a an uninterestingly enacted (should have been all consuming) burgeoning love from his love interest, the ending was as well a let down depicting a woman's capacity to 'do the right thing' and all is well as ends well. We never get a feel for the tortured billionaire's psych or feel any of the many hooks that should have torn at his love interest, all to be overcome by her passion, love, what have you (This since she has the unique opportunity to be in relation with this powerful man).All in all i feel let down, there is nary a statement made by this film other that 'stay in your safe place' lol"
" Wish I had seen it in the theaters
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"How anyone could not like this film is beyond me.The acting from both leads was superb and on point. The chemistry was ridiculously awesome, evident, and ongoing. The music was phenomenal. The cinematography was amazing. The wardrobe was perfectly fitting and proper. This film left me wanting more, wanting to see it again and again and of course, in total awe of Mr. Grey in all his conquests. Johnson is a gem and Dornan is everything a girl could ever want in a man who hides his feelings well while offering safety, protection, and all the ultimate pleasures the body can handle.Although this film portrays a different lifestyle from many, there is truly an underlying romance that shines brighter throughout the film, beyond lust, desire, pleasure, pain, and control. They fall in love and the passion is overwhelming.I look forward to watching it over and over again and every sequel thereafter, forever. This film is warranted in this decade, could not have been better, and leaves you wanting more in the best way possible. Watch it with an open mind, open heart, and pay close attention to the body language of the leads. It will draw you in!"
" Terrible
",2017-04-09 00:00:00,1,This was the worst movie iv ever seen!!!!!!!!! What the hell?!?!????????? It was just porn!!!!! I hated the story the acting everything!!!!!!! I couldn't take the stupidity so i stopped watching After 30 minutes !!!! It was just a movie to interest girls in being submissive to rich men!!! Hated it
" Now that was terrible..
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,2,"with Fifty Shades of Grey,you better save your money,time and popcorn.this movie is anything but good,full of flaws,terrible acting and directing,you will clearly notice the lack of emotions,the lack of chemistry between the main characters,coldness overloaded between them. the plot was real boring and weak,the scenes were lifeless and of course the soundtrack which was a disaster,actually you can notice easily that the music was louder than the character's voices,with a huge awkward and silent gap here and there between them. in the books,Christian Grey was supposed to be a charismatic intense and controlling man,well i haven't seen any of these with Jamie dornan,instead it was pure coldness,i had the feeling like Jamie was afraid of something,he didn't enjoy it,and if he really didn't why did he even bother get the role! Dakota Johnson was no better either,but you can tell she did maybe like a little bit the character of Anastasia steel,but still real bad acting. in a brief conclusion,this movie is a trash,especially for those who read the books just like i did,don't even bother buy a ticket to watch it,save your money for a movie worth your time and energy."
" One of the worst movies ever made
",2017-04-08 00:00:00,1,"This is a truly disturbed and terrible film. There is no real plot but just some sadistic moments. Why didn't you just make a porno? This was almost everything short of a porno without any real story. Most of us are adult enough to watch nudity within a broader and coherent film. In this case we have cheap nudity that pretends to have a story. Someone as sick as the male lead would never be in charge of such a large company, large companies are run by actual busy and hardworking adults.The writer of these books must be truly disturbed to write such worthless filth. The director of this rubbish is even more disturbed to adapt these books that are not good enough for toilet paper into a film. What is bewildering is the number of women that are into it. The female psyche will forever be an unending mystery. People commenting on their figure is inappropriate but watching a sadist film with submissive sexuality at the female's expense is alright."
" zero shades of jamie !
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,1,"what was that ? i have read the book,and regardless what s been reported ,and all the fuss,i found it genuinely entertaining and original,... a good movie would have made it memorable,but...,how do i begin ? ...this movie was a joke,a bad joke!!!! it felt like a cheap boring aimless documentary, it has no soul,it was a disaster,i mean what were they thinking?????? jamie is like miles away from being the flawless charismatic ""christian grey"",no personality,no depth, nothing,just a superficial, absent minded ""dude"" who s just there to make money.. dakota,nonetheless,seems a little bit more devoted to the role,but doesn't do better either,... zero chemistry and zero attraction between the main characters make you feel uncomfortable,i mean these two seem to confuse reality with cinema and are just busy avoiding each other and it is way noticeable on screen. no sound track,no charm,no story,no emotions and no point of the whole drama. this movie is a dead piece of art,which has intentionally turned the story into garbage ,with a lousy director and a failed cast,... why the effort ,if there was no interest in the book,for whatever reason it might be,... what a waste of money and time..Hollywood at it s lowest!!!"
" Why Am I Giving It A Ten
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,10,"I watched Fifty Shades Grey yesterday March 19 2017 from my European Union Croatian HBO Telekom Provider at my Asus S 200 E Notebook with Windows 8 Pro 64 Bit installment. God knows I tried not comparing 50 Shades Grey which is a second part of the novel thrillogy and a first part of a cinematic thrillogy to an original 9 1/2 Weeks but it is just impossible not to. I read every novel from a thrillogy and the first I read was a novel Fifty Shades Freed 23rd September 2013 as a to be continued first (...) part of a novel thrillogy which would be a third part of a cinematic thrillogy scheduled for a premiere February 2018. I am not going to be reviewing pros and cons but an overall cinematic impression. From my respectful perspective, I would not utilise any part of this cinematic artistry for a sales and marketing campaign. That written, Grey's cinematic fashion is awful. It is as if director utilised a fashion designer retro creativity to remind viewers of a fashion from a 9 1/2 Weeks cinematic artistry which would be ridiculed with a denim street fashion. Secondly, Christian Grey is not handsome enough for a suit nor for a denim. I would rather visualise Grey in a some kind of an uniform. In such a manner, it would become rather interesting for a director to destrict his uniform appearance to submissive because, in a matter of a Fifty Shades Thrillogy, Christian Grey is a submissive even though cinematic story evolves around submissive philosophical tutorials given to Anastasia Steel. In my not so humble opinion, this would be a difference between 9 1/2 Weeks and a Fifty Shades Thrillogy which an author El James, due her a wee-bit infantile approach, did not successfully disclosed to a reader nor to a viewer. Nevertheless, I am giving it a ten for this childish approach even though I would never invest my rationalised financials into this cinematographic piece."
" Fifty Shades Of Christian
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie recently. I didn't read the book but it made me want to read it and so I went and bought it. I find it a very interesting movie to watch. Not your normal movie but a very decent one. It shows us a young handsome businessman Mr. Grey seducing a young naive student Miss Steele who has fallen in love with him as they both explore different feelings, which leads to destruction like most passionate relationships. I can say that this kind of love is complicated but it makes it worthwhile because of the attraction of its opposites characters. It has drama and excitement.What went wrong is that some parts are not written very good. Like the beginning it should have been more intriguing. The sex scenes should have been for both satisfying and the end wasn't very pleasant...Honestly I would rather see Chris or Liam Hemsworth as Mr. Grey, but we can't have it all... The actor Jamie Dornan, except from some minor mistakes and parts I can say that he played Christian very well. He was very attractive & sexy and really knows how to handle a woman in a seducing and romantic way.The main problem in the movie I believe is the main actress. Anastasia should have been more interesting and more flattering, that's the opposite of what Dakota Johnson offered in this film. There's not enough acting and zero chemistry with her opposite partner. I had high hopes for the female character but I think they chose wrong with her for the sexy and romantic scenes.. I wanted more romance, more passion and more sex between them. It's sad that is too late now to replace her.Overall I think it's a great movie. Worthy to watch. That's my point of view."
" I May Never Go To The Movies Again
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,1,"Have we really sunk this low? This is what's considered entertainment? Poor Tippi has to see her granddaughter splayed all over the screen! This nonsensical tale is so tasteless, not to mention un-erotic, it makes you wonder whether the entire human race has lost their brains. It'll put you into a 2-hour coma. Poorly acted. Inane dialog. Hey, nice scenery. Did they have to steal the giddy glider rendezvous from the remake of ""The Thomas Crown Affair?"" Have they no imagination of their own? Can't think of any redeeming qualities here. Someone please clue me in. No, wait! Better off spending your time reading D. H. Lawrence if you're looking for a wee bit of titillation. At least you'll get some exposure to good writing. And get this - ""Fifty Shades"" was such a sensation it merited a sequel! I give up. I'm going into hibernation. See ya!"
" What do you expect
",2017-03-14 00:00:00,6,"I thought I wrote a review of this film at the time but evidently I did not. All I can say to help you enjoy this movie or not hate it is, what do you expect? It's a kind of trashy, pretty pornographic book put onto a cinema friendly big screen...You're not going to get full on sexual content because the 18 certificate doesn't allow it, so of course the sex isn't going to live up to the books. The book itself revolves tightly around the 2 main characters (as far as I know) and their SPOILERS relationship/sexual contract and indeed, that's what you get.The acting doesn't seem great and the toned down sexual content could easily disappoint viewers expecting better, but if you go in expecting these things as I did, it's a lot less offensive than people seem to be finding it. I'd say the worse things about it are the main female character's acting, she can be pretty annoying to watch, and her Lip-Biting-Count although even that is only about 3... but that is already 2 too much.You might not agree with my review or find it useful, but that's my view on the movie. Quite dull and annoying characters, very insular, but basically does what you'd expect given the constraints of the transfer... That said, I'm writing this after just having seen the second movie which is actually way better and develops into a more normal story of romance and drama."
" Very true to the book, but more suggestive eye acting required
",2017-03-10 00:00:00,6,"Not sure what all the fuss was about in terms of sexual content with this first of the trilogy movies: you see more sex in one episode of the television show 'Shameless'. There was very good casting with some of the actors: Max Martini as Taylor (looking forward to seeing more of him in the second film), and Eloise Mumford as Ana's best friend Kate (beautiful as well as an excellent actress, although her part in the film was smaller than in the book). The film is limited as to what can be achieved in 2 hours: There was so much more content in the book than in the film. And there lies the challenge. I think the scriptwriters could have done a better job to include more dialogue to clarify: how Ana's parents reacted to Christian (as well as Christian's parents to Ana), and how upset Ana became as the story progressed, as she was subjected to matters with which she lacked understanding. They didn't convey how Kate was aware that Christian was making Ana ""cry all the time now"" as she dealt with her feelings of confusion, and was very protective of her friend. There could have been many more meaningful glances from Christian to show how totally enraptured he is with Ana, how this attraction is supposed to grow throughout the story, and his constant inner battles that she must be too naive for him to initiate into this 'lifestyle' so he should leave her alone. Still, the locations and sets were spot on, the content which was included was very true to the book, and overall the director did a good job to capture this budding 'romance'."
" Should of left it as a book
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,1,"I read the first book because of the hype but it was poorly written and had cheesy dialogue. Watched it on HBO one day. The movie was cringe-worthy and the dialogue is even more embarrassing said out loud. The sex scenes aren't shocking and there's no conflicts in the story. Just two people who try to date and know they shouldn't but they try to make it work and it doesn't.There is no chemistry between the leads. Jamie Dornan looked so miserable and was wooden but Dakota Johnson at least tried. One positive of the film is Sam Taylor-Wood direction. She took a lot of heat for the film but she did the best she could with the material given. My biggest problems are the portrayal of Christian and Ana. Christian is a creep who enjoys having sex and beating women who look like his birth mother and kind of just blames it on his childhood. He stalks, tracks Ana's phone, tells Ana what to eat and controls her. Christian's child molester, ""Mrs. Robinson"" doesn't face any consequences.Ana thinks she can change Christian and at the end of the film, gets mad at him and then leaves even though she knows what he wants and what he's going to do. Romance doesn't cure an abusive relationship and I hate how it's portrayed as a fairy-tale. Kind of feels the author of the book hates women and doesn't know a thing about men."
" Tame but watchable
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,6,I didn't read the books or the reviews before I watched the film. I found the film to be very tame really. It did keep my interest which was surprising as nothing really much happened. I don't know why people are saying it was domestic abuse or rape. He did nothing to her that she hadn't already agreed to. It's called consensual.
" Interesting movie on the struggle of recognition and sexual consent
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,6,"I didn't expect to enjoy this movie at all, but, to my surprise, I did. It is a movie about the struggle for sexual recognition and freedom. It is about a couple who love each other, but they cannot give in and completely surrender to each other's desires. This movie is deeply existential and Sartrian. In love, as Sartre says,""the lover wants to be 'the whole world' for the beloved"", and sexual desire is mainly about conflict (in the Hegelian sense of the master and slave dialectic). In this struggle for owning each other and subjugating each other's desires (in other to affirm our freedom as individuals), they both lose. Although they both understand the game of sex and love in the end, they are unwilling to play by it (by surrendering) and they both end up hurt. I was also very impressed by how feminist the movie is. He is obsessed with obtaining her consent. All her experience with men was with men who were totally indifferent to her desires and consent. Remember the man (her friend outside the pub when she was totally drunk) who was almost forcing himself upon her just to get a kiss. The movie shows us what real consent looks like: straightforward, negotiated, not taken for granted, with safe words with are able to communicate refusal. And, precisely because of this, it is seen as unromantic. Yes, our culture eroticizes sexual violence and rape and we would rather criticise the man who asks us explicitly if we consent than the man who takes it for granted and doesn't care. The main character is obsessed with getting her consent. He is very attentive to her wants and desires. She is not used to it and that's precisely why it seems so strange to her (and to us). I didn't rate it that well, despite all the good things in it, because it is not directed very well, the actors are not that good and they could have tried a bit better with the script. So, it is not a good movie overall, but it makes many excellent points."
" Good adaption, loved every bit of it
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,10,"I started out reading the books awhile ago before I saw the movie because I'm one of those people who will read a book before watching the film and I have to say that this was definitely a good adaption. I now, after watching it the first time, have watched it too many times to count. To begin with, the plot line is perfect if not lacking a few scenes from the book or adapting them slightly. The actors play the characters perfectly too and are how I would imagine them to be from the books and can no longer imagine them any other way. They give the characters some emotion, backstory and personality and I would not have them any other way. The sex scenes are...should we say very interesting and are again mostly how they are imagined in the book. I love this movie and it is one of my favorites and not only because of the sex scenes but because of the stories and their character arcs leading to the end."
" one of the worst movies i've ever seen
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,1,"wasted 1.5 hour just waiting for something important to happen; or even for just some ""sum up"", or finalization of idea, but the ending was a complete disappointment, as the movie in total... completely not worth spending your time... actors and actresses play is terrible; the girl's mood during the whole movie is one and the same... these roles could have been played much better... even in Georgia it would be shoot much better :)))))))"
" Disappointing
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,2,"This film was being advertised and raved about all over Brisbane a couple of years ago. It piqued my interest, and I just now got the opportunity to watch it. What a letdown. The actors have little on-screen chemistry; the scenes, although somewhat erotic at times, are pretty clichéd; the storyline is predictable and the ending is unresolved. Even the support actors did little to raise the level of acting. Much better watching for suggestive eroticism is 9 1/2 Weeks with Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger, or if you want a silly but entertaining romantic romp, select a Hugh Grant movie, which at least will involve a reasonably high level of acting."
" A terrible romance from an awful novel
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,3,"Based on the popular novel by E.L. James, Fifty Shades of Grey tells the tale of a wealthy billionaire and his lover as they pursue BDSM. Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is tasked with interviewing the wealthy mogul Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) to help her roommate. There is an evident attraction that only grows as Christian shows up in her life continuously and sends her expensive gifts. Anastasia finds his intrusions bizarre but can't help but be attracted to his wealthy lifestyle and multiple talents. The movie is really boring with a plot that plods along spotted with the occasional sex scenes in a bland attempt to engage viewers and I guess appeals to women. The first book was exceptionally awful but I don't think I will ever read the second or continue the series. Grey's behavior is that of a possessive stalker and seems to be able to get away with this behavior because of his wealth and status. Anastasia resists and sees that there is still something good in this man she has come to know. She worries about his past and the older woman who corrupted him in his youth.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
" Better than i thought it would be!
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,7,"I loved this film, and unfortunately am now in love with Christian Grey. I don't read much, so i had not read the books. In a way I'm glad i had not so i started to watch this movie with an open mind and not knowing the plot. So, Mr. Grey is vulnerable and makes you want to do ANYTHING for him.... even getting involved in his sordid world of BDSM. He makes you want more, but also hate him for not letting you into his 'real world'. I love the mix of passion, sex and emotional role play. Anastasia still digging into his feelings, looking for signs of the 'real' Christian. He keeps his past close to his chest and will not let her in. This made me want to be Anastasia, and be in his strange world. I am looking forward to 2nd installment of Fifty Shades Darker as this film ends with a longing to know what happens next!"
" Nice to look at, dirty but tame
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,8,"Fifty Shades of Grey is a good adaption to the novel of the same. The main issue is that the famous novel is not great material to adapt to begin with. The lead girl did a fine job selling the innocence quality of her character and the virgin curiosity of a woman about to be immersed in a world of seduction. I did not feel the male lead sold his character that well. Overall, he was pretty to look at but did not convey the right carnal energy to make us believe he has something going for him other than his good looks and MONEY. He did do a good job showing the anger and the dominating side of their sexual relationship. It was hard to believe they could be in love, but these are issues from the book."
" I wish I was dead
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,1,"This movie is actually drying my vagina. It's making me never want to have sex. Not because of the fetish stuff, just these two fools are making it asexual somehow. Starting with the kissing, it looks like two goldfish going after the last piece of food. Next, Anastasia Dead-eyes Steele is verging on Kristin Stewart in public level awkward. He looks like Roadkill and his ""contract"" is the worst piece of shite I've ever heard. These two morons had about as much chemistry as a turd stuck in a dog's ass fur. I would rather pluck my eyes out with forks than watch this again, or any of the future sequels. Im just sorry that even after plucking my eyes out, I'd still have this movie burned into my brain. I'm going to be having PTSD flashbacks of this movie for the rest of my newly asexual life. Also she has bad boobs."
" Disappointed:(
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,3,"I have personally never read the book. The series didn't interest me too much since I heard about everything at work. My husband had listened to the audio tapes and said the movie should be steamy. Once the movie started we realized how boring it truly was and he told me it was not like the book. Not much steaminess, snooze fest and too many giggles from older ladies. We're going to see John Wick 2 this year instead of Fifty Shades Darker. If we decide to see fifty shades 2 we'll wait till it comes out online. Bottom line, my suggestion is not to waste money on this. If you can borrow the movie to watch for free I would do that."
" In short: Kelly Marcel (screenplay)and E.L. James (novel) you could do better and Dakota, good luck with that new agent.
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,2,"I love movies and as such it was entertaining to a certain degree and shooting scenes as well as camera angles were well placed; they kept me basically going to watch the movie to the end. Unfortunately, being a psychotherapist myself, I missed out on the why for Christian Grey's background for his ' pleasure ' phobia and having a short introduction of his mother I missed the plot regarding Christian's torment completely. I could understand Anna's attraction to the man that Christian portrayed but her misunderstanding of his pleasure for punishment unfortunately only came out only a little at the end. Controlling men aren't always the beefed up tough guys you see in the movies who yell and scream to get their way. They can be the soft-spoken boy next door or the well-educated, amiable extrovert. That was the only part well introduced in the movie. Christian uses his methods to train Anna like a puppy. When she obeys, she gets a treat. When she disobeys, she get nothing — or worse, punishment. I was continuing to watch the movie in order to find out what made Christian the man he decided to become? Perhaps, during an his younger years he was made to feel powerless through the process of his parent/s using him to compensate for their own sense of powerlessness. Not only had his own boundaries been violated; the parent's own need to feel a sense of power had also being denied. Sometimes this continues into the next generation and again into the next. But no, the movie did not give me an answer. There are many reasons why men become controlling and abusive and the only poor reason in this film seemed to have been that Christian had grown into a rich man to compensate for something he had missed out in his childhood. Again no scene in this movie made this transparent. On the whole, I found this movie not the slightest entertaining and in a way very noneducational. I left the theater with that nagging question: Who puts this out and thinks it could be a success?The movie was nominated after all for achievement in music and two nominations for performing ' Anna ' as breakthrough performance and as an actress most in need for a new agent; the awards went on for worst movie of the year, worst picture, worst actor, worst screenplay, worst director and so on."
" Just bad writing
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,1,"""Hi. I'm a handsome, rebellious billionaire who has mild non-threatening kinks that are supposed to paint me as spicy. I've been looking for a homely, dim-witted, dull woman who lacks any kind of depth or personality - just like you.""-there. you have now experienced the whole movie.I get the gimmick. The idea that a woman who has nothing to offer can land a good-looking (?) billionaire who excites her must appeal to all women who have nothing to offer. It's like shooting middle-aged female fish in a barrel. Fortunately; any woman with an ounce of intelligence, of self-respect, won't fall for it."
" Underdeveloped, not erotic, but not that bad either
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,6,"There has been so much fuss about the book on which this movie is based upon, and the movie itself that I decided that I give it a try out of curiosity. Fifty Shades of Gray is mostly an exploration of erotic love and of relationship dynamics, which is what is shown most of the time in the film. Two people fall in love but there are important things that aren't provided by the other, things demanded by the other that cannot be easily fulfilled by their partner. The story is also about a girl growing up into a woman, i.e. a girl going from wanting to please to be loved, to a woman who has needs and is not afraid of letting the relationship go if those aren't fulfilled. The story also explores why some men, in this case Grey, are into BDSM, why do they need to punish women and have a dominating sexual relationship to get erotic pleasure. I thought that all those things are real issues that affect real people all the time. I've come across directly or indirectly with men who were very similar to Grey, a sweet well-mannered outside and twisted souls inside that were into practicing BDSM to feel ""a man"".For me this movie is nothing to be passionate about, in any way. I didn't find the movie as shocking or bad as some people portray it, but I found it underdeveloped: sketched story, superficial exploration of the characters, TV-film production not Big-Screen production, and not really erotic.The main point of the film is getting to know why Grey is into kinky stuff, but this is barely sketched because this is, clearly, the first of a series of movies, and it was clear even before the last installment came along.I thought that Dakota Johnson does a good job in the film, perhaps the best of the cast, and goes from naive girl to a woman in a believable way.I thought that Dornan was not the actor for this role because the character needed of somebody with more dramatic register and a bit of an edge. Dornan doesn't have it, unfortunately. I thought he would be great in a normal romance movie, not in this one.I thought the Dornan and Johnson have no real chemistry on camera and the erotic scenes didn't turn me on at all, which is totally anticlimactic. I remember, in contrast, how good Nine Weeks and Half was at exploring a couple's intimate relationship with eroticism. The art of the erotic is not in having a sex scene, it is in the way you construct that scene and, most importantly, in the way the two people involved in it seemed to be into each other and enjoying it. I felt that Dornan and Johnson weren't fully present there.To the puritans and haters I would say that there are few sex scenes in the film but not too many. That there is nudity but no full frontal nudity and no genitalia are on display. That this is supposedly portraying a BDSM relationship but it is actually showing more a BDSM fantasy that real BDSM. That even though the male character is dominating the woman character, they have fully agreed on advance on that being consensual. That although there are sex scenes, there are films that aren't portrayed a sex movies and have plenty more sex and rougher one and nobody focus on those things when commenting on the film. Finally, if erotic scenes and intimate relationships really worry you, or you cannot deal with them, don't watch the movie :).Overall, an interesting plot, never fully developed, not a good direction or production, but not as bad as I expected."
" It's not so bad!!
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,7,"Oh you guys! You love to hate Fifty Shades. It's fashionable to trash and sledge it. I thought it was all right. Dakota Johnson was perfect for her role. Jamie Dornan was not as good, but he is really committed to the role and is watchable. The lighting and direction are good. The script has nice elements of humour and largely avoids clunky soap opera dialogue. It's wrong that Johnson has most of the nudity of the two leads. The sex scenes are quite tasteful, if a bit slick. The movie tries hard with a believable plot about Christian Grey shying away from real intimacy due to abuse. The supporting cast including the lovely Marcia Gay Harden as Christian's mother, are great. One objection I have is that the abrupt ending is so blatantly left open for a sequel, it's ridiculous. But overall, a surprisingly good film"
" Understandable Bad and Good
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,6,"So before i actually review this I must say one major thing: I skipped through all the sex scenes, and there were a lot of them. Now apart from that I understand wholly why a lot of people dislike this movie. The soft-core sex scenes were excessive, unrealistic, and lacking of actual chemistry between the main characters Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. But like I said earlier, I merely skipped those scenes. So what's left is the true story-line of a billionaire man who was taken advantage of as a naive child and has no other was to express himself than through the same form of ""pleasure"" he is accustom to in the first place. The reaction and depths of both Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele is more than what is focused on in the movie. The struggle Anna has to understand the horror of Christian's life and past is quite memorizing. It is a true challenge to understand the trauma that occurs in a past like Christian's; let alone try to understand his trauma through the same ""torture"" or ""pleasure"" the he himself had to grow accustom too. I was sincerely surprised by the past that Christian Grey had; my thoughts coming into this movie were primarily that it was another sex-addict's happy movie and that I would eventually add this movie to the list of disappointing movies I've watched, however, I am pleased by the background that is provided through the movie. My main issue with the movie (aside from excessive sex scenes) is that the ending was so abrupt and lacking that I was more mad by that part than intrigued by the movie. I will happily wait though from Fifty Shades Darker to come this February to see where this leads."
" fabulous!!
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,9,"what a marvelous movie!! I was so excited that now that i will close my laptop ,I will exercise everything they did !!! It has a deep meaning and an ending that no one could ever imagine!! The critics about the movie should be unemployed as they do not know how to do their job properly!! I would put 10 out of 10 stars but ....the first place is taken by another movie..... The guy was so handsome that I thought I lost my vision from his beauty!! He had a great performance ,he should get an Oscar for that!! I cannnot believe this inspiring movie for the reason that has too low rating. I recommend it to all the people of the earth and the planet system. The combination of the anger and the passion and love and the peculiar chemistry of those two lover birds was excellent."
" I LIKED this movie, LOVED the book.
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,8,"I've read all three books, so I had to see the movie. The books are INCREDIBLE, but so much of the book was left out of the movie! I guess I can understand why some of it would have to have been cut out, so they could get an r-rating, but they didn't leave enough in for people who are meeting Anastasia and Christian for the first time. I think, if you haven't read the books, you won't really understand what the relationship means to each of the characters or how it changed who they were as people. I can only imagine what I'd have been thinking, while watching the movie, if I hadn't ""met"" the characters in the books before hand. I don't think I'd of liked the plot or storyline or chemistry between the two lead actors either, like a lot of viewers who have written reviews about this movie. I'm hoping the second and third movies are better at showing the personalities and characters of the two leads and better at showing what this relationship really is and what the relationship means to them each. The movie, ""Fifty Shades of Grey"", made it seem as though Anastasia was this fragile, nieve, stupid little girl. It made Christian seem like all he is, is this rich, ""I get what I want, when I want it"" kind of axxhole, who only cares about himself. In the book, you can see how this relationship changes how they see themselves. The movie doesn't fully explain how the relationship has made each of them, in completely different ways, stronger people.Like I said, I loved the books, but the movie left me upset and wanting, no needing more. I will still be going to see the next two movies, when they come out, even though I really do not expect them to be any better. Well, I don't know, the third book really doesn't have a whole lot of sexual stuff in it, so now that I think about it, I think the 3rd movie will actually be great."
" BDSM? Nah, just Chick-Flick through and through
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,1,"Thank God I'm not the only one here thinking the movie was horrid. I really hate to admit it, but it was even worse than Breaking Dawn, despite being equally horrid. At least Breaking Dawn has an actual plot, but I think I've heard Fifty Shades'plot somewhere else, like, it's oozing in every adult-romance novels there is. The only difference that those chick flicks dealt with normal sexual preference instead of BDSM.When I first heard about BDSM theme of the novel (haven't read it), I thought it'd be about a BDSM maniac guy and his one hell of twisted life. But, after watching the first half of the movie, I thought, ""What the hell? It's nothing twisted, it's totally chick- flick!""I'm never a big-fan of chick-flicks, and it's hard to determine which one's more irrational; zombie's falling in love, sparkling- skinned vampire, or impeccably gentleman-like BDSM maniac. I think I'd opt for the last to be the most impossible. Yup, bottom line.I don't understand what the big fuss people were talking about this movie. Honestly, after the first half of the movie, I practically sleeping in the second half. It's everything to be expected from a chick-flicks; a hot, billionaire, impeccable gentleman, and proper guy falling in love (well, maybe, since I never read the novels and most likely would never, thanks to this infernal movie) with an innocent young woman and (most likely) would change him someday. *yawn* It's too chick-flicks, I can barely stand it.Acting aside, they're just as wooden as Kristen Stewart, everybody could see that. For me, it's nothing more than a delusional fantasy of every girl. Well, who wouldn't fall for a hot, billionaire, impeccable gentleman, and proper guy even if he's a maniac? You get a new car, new laptop, a room that you could decorate all you want, and a romantic date every weekend. And then you get to have your own personal health-monitor and not to be afraid of venereal disease when you're having 'fun' with said guy. Now, sparkling-skinned vampire becoming even more and more realistic. Blah...Honestly, I prefer sparkling-skinned vampire. Sure, both guys are impeccably gentleman-like. But the vampire was consistent throughout the movie(s), while the BDSM maniac doesn't even sit well with his own contract. It's just doesn't make sense."
" Take that Feminists!
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,10,"I give this movie 10 stars simply for pissing off all the annoying feminists out there. Is it the best movie ever? Nope.Is the acting amazing? Nope.Is the pacing ingenious? Nope.Are the sex scenes all that amazingly passionate? Nope.Does it do its job of irritating those who are uptight about sexual fetishes and want to control other peoples thoughts and opinions of it? Yup!Face it, it's needed in the mainstream. Get use to it feminists. Passion and sexuality rule the world."
