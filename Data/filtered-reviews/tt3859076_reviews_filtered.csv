" Great Story
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,10,This movie is a great watch. Dan Rather was a staple on the evening news in our household.
" To Tell The Truth, The Whole Truth, And Nothing But The Truth!
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,8,"It's sad to see this movie so misinterpreted and misunderstood to this day. But is exactly where the corporations want viewers of this to be. Intrigued, confused, and damning. Decades ago, journalists wanted to get 'the scoop', and often worked in unison or competitively to do so. If something was amiss or a blank spot to integrity and credibility that was deflected and brushed aside, a journalist or competitor would delve deeper to get the answer and/or 'the truth'. News and journalism was a form of 'law'. To deliver a complete story as best as possible, and either be supported by other journalists, or discredited and questioned with opposing evidence. But the start of any news story is usually 'a good question'. And in the case of Marla Mapes and Truth - did G.W. Bush complete his full tenure at the Texas National Guard, as there seems to be many questionable gaps in visible blank spots compared to others that had served. And the disturbing outcome was all nearest to Bush said he did - end of discussion. Then what of these gaps and incongruousness? And general response was 'they don't exist, and if they do - they shouldn't' And the American public majority AND news outlets AGREED! And for the evidence Marla and her team acquired, that freely existed, and/or were highly suspected links to support what could be freely obtained - the question remained open and unanswered. Why do these gaps and deferrals exist? And what became 'news' was the persistence of Marla and Dan Rather et al to get that question answered that would conclusively 'fill those gaps' in part or wholly. But instead, they became pests to Bush's re-election, and condemned as having 'an axe to grind'. I think Marla, Dan Rather, and the movie makers failed to illustrate is the fact that Marla, Dan, and CBS would've been fine if TNG, The White House, and those that were indirectly involved COULD substantiate with evidence Bush's full service and/or the hopefully understandable reasons why he couldn't complete fully. And let the public decide from there. But sad to say, the news is not like that anymore. And sadder to say - will never be again. The American public won't allow it due to imposed A.D.D. from 'sound bites', 'headline scrolls', 'top stories' of whatever the media says is the lead. And of course the media now is totally corporate and corroborative to 'profit leveraging'. Be it for the news outlet, the parent company and affiliates, to political contracts that may need a boost in awareness and support. And American's today will buy it - ALL of it! As long as it's served in fun size easy to digest doses."
" Horrible!
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,1,"What a terrible choice of Robert Redford to play Dan Rather.
Not believable at all."
" Generic, but VERY captivating mostly because of C. Blanchett and R. Redford acting perfection
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,8,"""Truth"" is not an investigative documentary, but a dramatic retelling of the events from mostly one perspective - Mary Mapes. The film itself is compelling and well told. The casting of both R. Redford and divine C. Blanchett is excellent - they're capturing the essence of their real-world counterparts rather than doing a shallow imitation. It comes as no surprise that the veteran actors are magic together, but the supporting get short-changed a bit, especially E. Moss and T. Grace (who is again one-dimensional and always the same no matte which movie he is in). Dennis Quaid's talents are wasted, too. To conclude, the film's ideas are universal, but it will mean most to Americans, who will know the iconic position of Rather in US journalism - so they will like it or hate it, it just depends are the republicans or democrats.Rating: 8+ (Here, Blanchett gives another stellar performance that rates among her best)"
" Some of the best actors in hollywood couldn't save this candy-coated cardboard pellet
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,3,"I don't know how accurate it was, but the movie itself was the epitome of glossy Hollywood garbage. Every shot looks like a commercial for soda and everyone is overly, nauseatingly beautiful and fake. It couldn't feel less realistic. Even the actors (and there are a number of really great ones here!) couldn't save this polished turd."
" A story about shoddy rushed political journalism - but it's not clear what the message is
",2020-01-14 00:00:00,7,"Short summary: Election coming up. Bush's numbers are not great. Mary Mapes already made some Bush critical reports, but they may not be enough. She has a loose contact who may have some interesting documents about Bush. That contact is a staunch Bush critic who has been criticized before for being biased and erratic in his critique of the president. He demands a contact with John Kerry's camp to set up a book deal. Mapes tries to set up both. Mapes runs with the story and instead of seeking the advice of experts she calls the documents real. On air CBS 60 Minutes says the documents were authenticated by experts. So, even if they were real CBS News lied on air as that statement is a fabrication. No such thing happened and CBS News later had to apologize for this story and fire all the people responsible for this error. It's called one of the greatest TV errors. A full network blundered and then defended the story for weeks until it was clear that they had to apologize and seek forgiveness.It's a very interesting story. But the movie has some glaring errors. One is that it just doesn't show even 10% of the errors Maple actually committed. Secondly, Maple is an overly emotional woman and cries and shouts all the time. It's probably how she really is, but it just doesn't work at all in the movie. There is barely a single scene where she seems in control of her emotional state. This makes her out to be a person who in reality should have a hard time even working in a convenient store let alone a big company.Now, in real life there were many more errors in this reporting. That's just not possible to show in a short movie, but you could make a TV show about errors in how they reported this story. While watching the movie there is some doubt about who did what or who was how biased. In reality the news story wasn't bad, but the reporting was terrible. It's still an interesting story. It's just that this was a rush job to make Bush lose his election. Had they waited till after the election for example, the story could have been much better and with concrete proof. Today some say that Bush's team set up CBS News to completely wipe out the whole story. But I'm not sure that's true either. Both sides have denied that they produced them, one side is surely lying.Mapes playing the political game while trying to make a factual based news show is just perplexing. I don't see how she could keep her job after contacting John Kerry presidential campaign and keeping contact with them. And then she made 9 other just as big errors in just this one news story. This is one of the cases were one ought to look over all her former stories for CBS News. But only they have the data on those stories so we'll probably never find out what errors she made where.It's a good movie, but the real story is much more scary and has many more errors in it. And the overemotional lead actress makes it more about a woman crying than the news itself. It's fine, but misses the mark for someone like me who wants to see more facts and fewer silly scenes."
" I've read that some people say this movie is terrible...
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,10,"But I strongly disagree, the problem was with the documents which wasn't the damned point of the story in the first place! Everyone knows now that Bush used his fathers connections to get out of going to Vietnam and that he got to do as he pleased where he did end up and wasn't held accountable, it's a well know fact that Bush Jr is a shiftless weasel, period! It was all just misdirection going after Dan and Mary, yes the documents were apparently questionable but the facts about Bush not having to go to Vietnam and how that was arranged and all the other stuff was absolutely the truth, I am quite certain his daddy was worried his idiot son wouldn't do too well over there, yet another perfect example of white rich man privilege!"
" Well-executed movie presenting one, and only one, side of the story.
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,5,"""Truth"" is a film much in the ballpark as ""Argo"" - cinematically excellent but factually questionable. The script is smart, the film proceeds at a rapid clip, and the performances, especially that of Cate Blanchett as Mary Mapes, are excellent. It's worth watching. It's also worth, however, realizing that this film is based on Mapes' own book on the disastrous 60 Minutes II ""expose"" questioning George W. Bush's National Guard service in the early 1970s, which quickly lost credibility shortly after its airing weeks before the 2004 election.There is no law requiring that movies or documentaries be fair, accurate or reflect all sides' recollection of events, and this movie is clearly sympathetic to Mapes, Dan Rather, and the other staffers at CBS that rushed the piece into production despite the shakiness of both human and document sources. Network executives, as is usually the case in such films (think ""The Post"" and ""Kill the Messenger"") are depicted as spineless in the face of attacks on the network's staff by Republicans and other networks. Those real-life individuals have blasted the movie's depiction of events but, alas, a film based on their perspective wouldn't fit the normal Hollywood narrative concerning the idealization of ""plucky, brave, intrepid reporters only seeking the truth in the face of partisan and corporate pressure."" What's peculiar about this movie is the near-godlike depiction of Rather by Robert Redford. Whether such marbleizing of a veteran but VERY flawed journalist was driven by Redford's own ego or infatuation by the actor, producer and/or director is a mystery.An unstated, and unanswered, question hovering over this movie is whether CBS's personnel (or those of any other mainstream news organization) pursued this story with such doggedness over five years had it been a Democratic candidate or president, especially a progressive one. Enjoy the film, but don't expect tough questions like this one to be addressed anytime soon."
" Satisfied
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,9,"Very addictive. History, based on facts, shows the difficulties of the journalistic world and its risks. I recommend especially to journalism students and adepts."
" Wonderful Kate Blanchett/Robert Redford movie drama
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,9,"This is a brilliantly acted, plotted, scripted and filmed movie about an important moment, and better still, is true. Wonderful insight into a large corporation and how events can unravel when things don't go as scheduled. If you love excellent drama then with this gem you have all you need. There are some poignant moments that will move or inspire, excellently framed by location or by way of the script itself. It would have been nice if the deleted scenes I saw on my dvd had actually been in the movie. I think it was a mistake to delete them. The pace and drama were excellent and the overall movie could have withstood a longer time frame. I thought the special features could have pictured the real life characters or given up more of the whole story. What I'm saying is that the movie was easily good enough to further my interest in events, and with that I would have rated this a 10. Overall a very interesting and concise piece of filmmaking."
" TRUTH....And Consequences
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,10,"The press has often been called the ""Fourth Estate"", serving as a check on undue influenced against the other three pillars of our democracy, the Executive, the Legislative (Congress), and the Courts. But the rush to get the Big Scoop out there, which began with the rise of CNN and other cable news outlets at the beginning of the 1980s, and the tendency to ""spice"" things up with entertainment paraphernalia that has nothing to do with news has led to mistakes being made. This became especially true after 9/11. And the most notorious (though not necessarily egregious) example of this came about in 2004, where an expose done by CBS News on the military record (or possible lack thereof) of then-president George W. Bush blew up so badly in their faces that it resulted in their longtime evening news anchor Dan Rather basically stepping down from the job he had held for twenty-four years. The story of that scandal was brilliantly told in the 2015 political docudrama TRUTH.Robert Redford stars as the legendary CBS news anchor who worked with 60 Minutes Wednesday producer Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett) in 2004 on a story where documents are found that suggest that Bush's service record, during the time that the U.S. was involved in the Vietnam conflict, was of a rather dubious nature, and that he may have gotten preferential treatment to join the Texas Air National Guard to avoid actual combat in Vietnam (unlike John Kerry, whom a pro-Bush political action group managed to successfully smear during his 2004 run for the presidency against Bush). Topher Grace, Elizabeth Moss, and Dennis Quaid are the crack team that Redford and Blanchett assemble to uncover the truth about the contradictions in Bush's record, including interviewing an officer (Stacy Keach) who gives them documentary evidence that Bush may have gone AWOL (Absent With Out Leave) from the National Guard in Alabama in 1972 and 1973. However, the bottom falls out in the aftermath of the story airing on 60 Minutes Wednesday in October 2004, just weeks before the election, when accusations surface that the documents may have been forged on Microsoft Word, and didn't use the same print type that was used on military typewriters of the early 1970s. Keach admits to not telling the truth to Blanchett or Redford to protect the identities of those who had given him the documents; and it isn't too long before CBS News, under the protection of chief Andrew Heyward (Bruce Greenwood), must make the decision to investigate whether the procedure was done wrong, and whether Blanchett's liberal politics had any bearing. While no actual evidence is ever found of either bad procedures or political ax-grinding playing a part, Blanchett finds herself out of a job, Redford's career in some tatters, and CBS News itself having to eat a huge amount of crow.Vanderbilt, who had already written the screenplays for, among other things, 2003's BASIC and 2007's ZODIAC, not only adapted Mapes' book but also made his directorial debut here with TRUTH, bringing the whole CBS News/Dan Rather/Mary Mapes saga to light, with a look at how journalists, particularly of the caliber at CBS, tried to put an important story together, but wound up being smeared with accusations of trying to smear a sitting president's military record, flimsy as that record may have been, while the pro-Bush ""Swiftboaters"" tried to politically maim Kerry, an actual Vietnam war veteran. Both Redford and Blanchett do good turns in portraying, respectively Rather and Mapes as people who doggedly tried to expose malfeasance and found themselves being targeted for some of that same kind of malfeasance by the people they were trying to investigate. Grace, Moss, Greenwood, Quaid, and Keach also do good turns; and the film itself does try to show this true story from both sides without malice. But it does make clear that malice was done, just to the integrity of the Fourth Estate.The saga that was depicted in TRUTH may very well turn out to be the defining event that would lead to what we saw got started in 2015 with the ascension of Donald Trump and his shrill shrieking calls of ""Fake News"" to journalists who question his veracity and other right-wing politicos of his type. But it is also a film that reminds us how, in the struggle to be the first on air with a big story, the news media can be easily manipulated; how it has to fight back more than ever against the Orwellian term of ""Fake News""; and why good, dogged journalism is needed more than ever. While people at CBS, and TV journalism did suffer from this incident, TRUTH makes the case that they need not have suffered in vain."
" I believe
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,7,"Pretty good film depicting journalists trying to get dubya down before a second mandate. It backfired against them. True or not, lots of people tried to avoid going to Vietnam and even escaped by thousands to Canada. This could not bring him down."
" Blanchett! Blanchett! Blanchett!
",2018-05-20 00:00:00,8,"Blanchett! Blanchett! Blanchett! (Over-dramatisation of ending takes away from mostly measured, cerebral tone of the rest of the film. Maybe more affecting for American audiences where Dan Rather appears to be almost presidential. His final speech to camera was over-blown.) (viewed 1/17)"
" Courage
",2018-05-02 00:00:00,8,"This is a dramatization of the events that lead to the resignation of Dan Rather(Robert Redford) and firing of Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett) of CBS news/ 60 Minutes. It shows us how the reporters gathered the Bush air force reserve story and were rushed to meet a deadline. About a third of the way through Rather canonizes Mary Mapes by telling us her biography. The production includes scenes where they have to tell her the resume of Dick Thornburgh, something that most likely didn't happen but was done for us ""stupids"" in the audience.Redford did a good job. You could close your eyes and see Dan Rather when he spoke. Nailed it. Blanchett did a convincing job of Mary Mapes, a woman who depicted as a hard and honest worker with daddy issues. Since Mapes wrote the book on which they based the script, expect to see a story told from her viewpoint. People who ""are now or have ever been a liberal"" might enjoy this film more than a conservative.Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Trying to turn biased liars into heroic figures insults anyone's intelligence.
",2018-01-28 00:00:00,1,"So Dan Rather and his Producer Mary Mapes report that there's a smoking gun 'letter' that proves George W. Bush's father's political connections evaded Vietnam. That's the only truth here. It was in the environment of 2004 Presidential election, and the obvious motive was to draw contrast to John Kerry who did serve in Vietnam and help Kerry defeat then-President Bush. This 'letter' proved to be a fabrication as the font used in the letter wasn't invented until more than 20-plus years later. Thank God this falsification occurred before the election, but I shudder to think if had not been found to be a fake until after AND Kerry had won in a close election... So why would there be a movie made showing rank liars and people trying to undermine our democracy by lying and hiding under the First Amendment AND making them heroes? Just watch CNN or any other of the 'main stream' news and you'll realize that they are no longer concerned with reporting facts and context, today they are trying to manipulate you by 'reporting' things as they see it through their liberal narrative. PERIOD!This is probably one of the lamest movies I've ever seen, trying to pull every emotionally manipulative string. What else would you expect when the co-writer is laughably Ms. Mapes herself?? Talk about self-indulgent. But I guess the biggest question is: which movie executive gave the green light to this sh!tpile and who even went to see it??"
" A movie about father and daughter, and her husband
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,8,"Yes, it's a film that sheds light on the finest parts of journalism. But I value this movie because it's a story of a woman who had been harassed by her father all her life. If it weren't for that father, the protagonist may have not become the fighting woman she is now today.The most moving scene of all, however, is when we find out the reason she married her husband. A girl like her would marry a guy like him for that sole reason, and I know because I am that girl.So is this too personal to be a movie review? I hope not. There are probably tons of women out there who live family lives like that of the protagonist. And to know the true value of this precious piece of work, you need to see it, and then you need to get your partner to see it, and then you need to find a way to talk about that scene with your partner, and just a few words exchanged about that scene will make your life so worth it. For that reason, this is one of those great movies like ""The Machinist"" or ""Gone Baby Gone"" which cannot get enough attention because the gorgeous part is only in its spoilers."
" Compares favorably to The Post
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,8,"I saw The Post this week and decided to also watch Truth at home to compare two stories about journalism and the media. I found Truth to be just as compelling a story as The Post, with a steller cast and screenplay, with plenty of drama, even though I knew the general outlines of the story and the outcome for those at CBS News. I did not know a lot of the details about how CBS, Mary Makes, and Dan Rather were caught up in some unfortunate mistakes that had little bearing on the veracity of the claims about Lt. George W. Bush and his time in the Air National Guard. This story paints an even larger story about how corporations react to bad publicity and right wing pressures that if anything have gotten worse over time. The movie does a good job in presenting how much fact checking is involved in major news stories, and how easily it can all become unraveled through a series of small errors that add up to one large error. The movie makes a strong case for the truth of the story hence the title of the movie. Cate Blanchett is outstanding as Mary Mapes and Robert Redford is excellent as Dan Rather, and the supporting cast is uniformly excellent. This is a movie that contains top flight actors across the board. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. It is a worthwhile two hour investment."
" Slick and pointless
",2018-01-17 00:00:00,5,"In 2015 who could possible give a sh$$ whether a former (by 7 years already) president skipped out on his National Guard duty
It's like Contarded-Americans blathering on about Obama's birth certificate after he's out of office. 
Nobody cares. They're in the history books
So if some picayune detail about George II can't possible hold viewers' interest - I was bored to death by the time Topher Grace showed up 15 minutes in - are we supposed to care about the journalists? 
Nobody has ever heard of Mary Mapes or any of the other clowns in this drama not named Dan Rather. And Rather was a caricature of a self-satire of a self-important TV talking head years - maybe decades - before the events told in this story. 
On the other hand I did learn that Rather pounded A&W Root Beer-sized mugs of scotch. So I guess that's something."
" Journalism Problem With The Watergate Legacy
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,7,"I like the performances in this film. Nice to see Redford doing a Dan Rather imitation. Cate Blanchett is superb as Mary Mapes whose book and real life experience is brought into the fore front here. Stacey Keach and other support cast is excellent too.The problem here is that despite the Watergate type atmosphere like ""All The Presidents Men"" which this imitates, there is some major screaming that has to be done and I am doing it here. Dan Rather had to step down as CBS anchor after this George W. Bush National Guard story aired. It is replayed in this film.The story is Mary Mapes digging out the facts about the story. The failure of Journalism here is shown in it's most graphic detail. ""Why is the story important?"" It is only important because there was an election going on. Even if all the facts were proven (and they weren't), there is no crime. Nixon tried to destroy the two party system. Bush might have gone AWOL. Fact not pointed out in the film, Dan Rather actually did go AWOL walking off the CBS News set when he threw a tantrum.The film actually insults Rather. It points out vividly that he went to air without any verification of the story just trusting Mary Mapes word. I can hear Walter Cronkrite turning over in his grave on this. Rather does not look good on this, and CBS News does not look good either. It is an important film because it does point out what CBS News did recently to Scott Pelley. One night on CBS Evening News, Scott was interviewing one of the top people on the collusion of Russia in the Trump Election. Everything went off well and good until Scott actually had the guts to ask him if he really ""had any real evidence of the collusion?"" The guy got angry, would not answer because he could not answer the question (he obviously had no proof) that Scott had gone
 off script with. Within a week CBS had demoted Scott off the Evening News anchor job. This is proof of the establishment that is illustrated in Mary's story and is actually more than a little scary.Rather was a field reporter during JFK's killing and in Dallas. He fed Walter live reports on November 22, 1963. Among those initial reports were hints of a vast Right Wing conspiracy being involved killing JFK. When it came out that Oswald visited/ defected to the USSR, lived there, found a bride there, came back here and then supported the ""Fair Play For Cuba Comittee"", it is much more logical that Oswald was a ""Left Wing Conspirator"". One of the great ironies of history as it is written is that a Left Winger really shot JFK, Case Closed.Now, getting back to ""Truth"", the problem here is just that. The Truth here gets murdered for no good reason. It keeps happening now, because the main stream media is too busy manipulating public opinion through rigged polls which have even less facts than this Guard story, and reporting them as news stories. The real truth is that when a main stream media uses the same sources of polls for news stories as Rush Limbaugh (Pew Research), Houston, Journalism has a real problem. This film wastes a lot of good performances by trying to make a certain type of Journalism look good. What the film really does (I wonder if this is the point of Mapes Book) is make Journalism look very bad. Case Closed"
" Is it news or is it conjecture?
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,7,"CBS prime news producer Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett) and her staff investigate allegations that George W. Bush was given preferential treatment while in the military which kept him out of Viet Nam and that he may have also been AWOL for a periods of time. Believing the memos in their position are hard evidence validating their claims, they prepare a segment for their weekly 60 Minutes program. News veteran Dan Rather delivers their findings before their viewing audience just months before the 2004 presidential election.This film illustrates how people can convince themselves they are doing the right thing for all the wrong reasons and leads to the beginning of the downfall of news organizations. If you're not sure how the news is produced, you might want to see this one."
" Giving CBS the middle finger
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,7,"Powerful non-fiction drama about the modern-age tactic of tearing apart someone else's news story for fear of its validity--or rather, finding a vulnerable link in that story and attacking it, dissecting it in the public eye, until nobody remembers anymore what the point of the actual story was supposed to be, only that a flaw was found and therefore it's a crock. Cate Blanchett is excellent as ""60 Minutes"" producer Mary Mapes who, just prior to the 2004 presidential election, thought she found a tasty piece for the television news program on CBS: questioning whether President George W. Bush received preferential treatment during his time in the military. With hard evidence in the form of letters and documents that Bush did skate by (going AWOL for one year), Mapes and her team beat a five-day clock to produce the story news-anchor Dan Rather (Robert Redford) reported on the air. All appears to be fine after the segment airs, but when pro-Bush camps go after the accuracy of the documents--perhaps smelling a liberal bias--Rather, Mapes and her crew are all called on the carpet by nervous network executives. An investigation of journalism, of television news and its ethics, of politics in the business of TV news and the internal workings of breaking a story about a story all come to the fore here, in generally grand fashion. Redford, initially, seems a curious choice for Rather; he looks nothing like the legendary television personality, though he does have Rather's cadence down and you come to believe in the performance. Blanchett and her support, Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Elisabeth Moss, are all terrific. Director James Vanderbilt, who also co-produced and adapted Mapes' book, ""Truth and Duty: The Press, the President and the Privilege of Power"", does fluid, engrossing work. While the theatrical film faded fast at the box office, it plays very strongly on cable or home video. This might have been the perfect HBO event movie, the intimate medium of television a better fit for the material. *** from ****"
" Cate Blanchett at her best
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,8,"If you couldn't tell by the title, Truth is a true story. Cate Blanchett plays the producer of 60 Minutes, Robert Redford plays Dan Rather, and Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace, and Elisabeth Moss play the supporting crew. In 2004, right before the presidential election, Cate hears of a potential story that President George W. Bush's military record might have been fabricated. With something that serious, they'd better make sure they have a reliable source and can defend such an accusation, otherwise they'll face a terrible backlash from the American public, their own network, and the government! If you remember what happened in 2004, you won't be that surprised by the plot of Truth. But if you're too young to remember, or you weren't paying attention to politics back then, it's a very suspenseful and tense story. Cate Blanchett gives one of the finest performances in her career; I was baffled as to why she was nominated for an Oscar for Carol that year instead. Robert Redford is also very good, and before you get mad at him that he's not doing a good Dan Rather impersonation, you should know he chose not to imitate. He wanted, well, a truthful performance, rather than one that would garner gasps and giggles from the audience as they say, ""Wow, he's just like him!"" Dan Rather himself was very pleased with the film, and with Redford.Not all politicos will like this movie, even though James Vanderbilt's screenplay is very thoughtful and suspenseful. If you're a die-hard Republican or thought Robert Redford should have minded his own business in All the President's Men, you might not like this one."
" Disappointingly unnecessary level of expletives
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,6,"It's gotta be me, because nowhere else in the reviews did I even see this mentioned. I thought it was a reasonable movie given that I had never heard of this ""scandal"" before, but the thing that turned me off it completely was the level of language. I cannot for the life of me understand how movie writers, producers, directors, actors think that language of this nature can enhance a movie experience. As with most movies these days one has to tolerate a certain level of profanity otherwise all we would watch would be ""G"" rated movies and, as a result, miss some great movies which also contain some language, but certainly not to the extent of this one. I would be very reluctant to recommend this movie to a friend."
" An Interesting Watch!
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,7,"Based on American journalist and television news producer Mary Mapes' memoir Truth and Duty: The Press, the President and the Privilege of Power, 'Truth' benefits from an interesting screenplay, that brings a true-story on the big-screen. With a top-notch cast giving their all & the pace, that almost remains consistently on point, help 'Truth' into a compelling watch.'Truth' Synopsis: Newsroom drama detailing the 2004 CBS 60 Minutes report investigating then-President George W. Bush's military service, and the subsequent firestorm of criticism that cost anchor Dan Rather and producer Mary Mapes their careers.'Truth' is a political docudrama, that re-tells a scary true-story on people who were misguided & later suffered their rich careers. 'Truth' delves into perspective & how back-stab can end careers & reputation. Watching these people at CBS lose their might, despite what they intended to be a strong, shocking revelation, offers shock value. Its interesting to see how their investigation begins & how it all fizzles out. Its sad, but the treatment remains gripping.James Vanderbilt's Adapted Screenplay is consistently engaging, but its flawed as well. The Writing gets flabby in the second-hour & once the fiasco occurs, the narrative begins to stagnate. The culmination is well-written, though. Also, the pacing is razor-crisp in the first-hour, but loses momentum in the second-hour. And these flaws show up unexpectedly & come up as minuses. Nonetheless, 'Truth' never gets boring or unengaging, despite its hiccups. Vanderbilt's Direction is credible. Cinematography & Editing are good. Art & Costume Design are excellent.Performance-Wise: Cate Blanchett as Mary Mapes is sensational. Her performance stands out. Right from a flawless American accent, to the helplessness in her eyes & in her body-language after the fiasco occurs, are beyond exemplary. Robert Redford as Dan Rather is first-rate, adding tremendous grace to the part. Dennis Quaid as Colonel Roger Charles is in top-form after a long time. The veteran is superb. Topher Grace as Mike Smith & Elisabeth Moss as Lucy Scott are effective, although under-utilized. Bruce Greenwood as Andrew Heyward is brilliant, as always. Stacy Keach as Bill Burkett is terrific. Others lend great support.On the whole, 'Truth' is an absorbing watch. Definitely, worth your time!"
" Truth Be Told
",2017-07-01 00:00:00,9,"For the record, I am not affiliated with any political party. Being the hardcore moderate that I am, I watched Truth with an open mind and as objectively as possible. Based on a news story by Dan Rather and 60 Minutes, the movie appears to have gotten some inspiration from The Insider, even ripping off a scene from the Michael Mann classic (and one of my all-time favorite films). I can see how some Republicans may not like Truth, but I always appreciate a good story about people against insurmountable odds. The movie's very well-written and directed, backed by a superb all-star cast. And that's the truth."
" Excellent drama, heavy thoughtful film, with unsatisfying end
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,6,"Truth (2015): saw this film on FX just now, starring Cate Blanchett, Robert Redford, Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace. A compelling story about journalism and the advent of internet journalism. A bit slow at start, then moves to a false ending when we see the reporters made a successful ""60 minutes"" show about G. W. Bush's alleged receipt of preferential treatment in the National Guard, weeks prior to his re- election in 2004. Scandals arise when it was pointed out that the documents presented in the show is possibly a forgery, the last half of the film deals with how the reporters must now try to fight back in defense to their report. Cate Blanchett is perfect as usual. She's strong but fragile at the same time. Her portrayal of Mary Mapes, the producer of the ""60 minutes"" show, on the verge of losing her job while standing up to the multitudes of 'bullies' trying to discredit her is the main drive of the film. She just brings so much depth into her characters. I can't get enough of her. That said, due to the possible political bias in the movie itself, there are some assumptions that the movie is trying to feed the viewers, and I'm not sure it is as politically neutral as it can be. The movie speaks in volumes about what the general crowd thinks now of investigative journalism, and our (dis)ability to separate truth from fiction. A piece of film worth thinking about, but somewhat not super satisfying at the end."
" Never let the facts get in the way of a good story.
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,5,"This is a very good film. The cinematography, writing, acting, pacing, and most everything else just works. Particularly satisfying is Redford's portrayal of Rather, while not an impression or imitation, treats the man with the respect which is his due. Based on Ms. Mapes's book covering the ""Rathergate"" scandal, it tends to cover both sides of the issue - was the story politically motivated? The film says ""No!"" but the words say ""Yes!"" It's left up to the viewer to decide - which is a welcome and refreshing movie experience in the days of Michael Moore leftist propaganda.The problem I have with the story is the constant assertion that the CBS 60-Minutes news team did no thing other than pursue the truth. This is not the case by the film's own revelations. The team starts off with a clue that George W. Bush was AWOL during his ""privileged"" tour in the Texas Air National Guard, and that he was ""released early"" so he could attend Harvard. At times it reads like Stone's JFK with conspiracy theories flying about and fingers pointing at enlarged documents on the wall, building this ""solid"" case that Bush was deliberately put out of harms way because of who he is while others died in Vietnam. While the film does touch on John Kerry's ""purple heart"" debacle - it fails to mention stronger issues such as Bill Clinton being the beneficiary of friends in high places regarding Vietnam. The 60-Minutes crew has just one problem - they can't find any collaborating evidence to support their theory. They call everyone they can find and it isn't that no one is willing to talk about it, but they are constantly told there is no story here and getting hung up on. ""No stings were pulled"" they are constantly told. Suspecting that everyone is afraid of Bush, and rather than ""following the facts to the truth,"" they continue to dig, and end up finding Bill Burkett, who has copies of two memos that seem to suggest that Bush was AWOL from the Air National Guard. They don't say that, but it's what Mapes WANTS to believe, and so they go with it. AWOL stands for ""Away Without Leave"" which means a soldier who has orders to be at a post at a certain time was not - in fact - there at that time and in violation of those orders. A soldier is not AWOL if he is away WITH permission - something the film glosses over. That is, we never know if Bush has permission or not - just that he was not on base to be evaluated - according to the memos.They try to have the documents authenticated, and two of the four experts refuse to do it because they are not originals. Mapes pushes forward, backed by the belief that even if the memos themselves are fakes, the information on them is at least true, and that's good enough. They put the story together, and because 60-Minutes is being pre-emptied by - shudder, a Billy Graham crusade - they decide to push the story out in four days rather than - well - actually baking the story more before rushing it to air. According to the film, they were editing footage seconds before air time. But, it would seem, it was more important to get ""the truth"" out about Bush in the election year sooner than later, then say, do their jobs.Calamity ensues after the airing, with everyone pointing out the very obvious proportional fonts used in the memos, the fact that they were copies of copies, the New Times Roman Font, and a silly stunt about the super- scripted ""th"" which indicate that the memos were produced using Microsoft Word. They actually dig through boxes of documents looking for a super-scripted ""th"" to ""prove"" that it was possible in 1972 to have a typewriter with such a feature. Tap-dancing and straw- grasping at its most desperate.The film ends with an inquest, where Mapes defends the memos insisting that they must be real because of the intimate knowledge a forger would have to possess in order to create them, but then make the ridiculous mistake of creating them using Microsoft Word. That alone screams that the documents should not have been trusted, but Mapes did anyway because - well - you can't un-ring a bell and if it gets Kerry elected then it's all in being on the Right Side of History. Yet, it still doesn't excuse why the memo format wasn't questioned until it was pointed out to them. The punch line is that Mapes needed them to be true so they could smear Bush. Right or wrong, true or false, the story was run to smear Bush, which is NOT pursuance of the truth even if it should end up being the truth.The film never takes a solid position on Bush, and I think that's the point. What is the truth here? It's left up to the viewer."
" Only Two Years Old, and So Much Has Changed
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,8,"This film came out in the twilight of the Obama years, and it's now 2017, and how the country has changed. I resisted seeing this film because I knew it would make me angry. And it did. But that does not take away from the story, and especially the acting. This film is more about Mary Mapes than Dan Rather, and the roller-coaster ride she and her crack team of reporters (all beautifully played by Dennis Quaid, Elizabeth Moss, and particularly Topher Grace) took while investigating the military background of soon-to-be-re-elected George W. Bush. Although I have not researched this myself to confirm, the film mentions that Mapes, Rather and CBS wanted more time to verify the sources and evidence, but ""60 Minutes"" and other hard news programs were being relegated to late hours with millions of less viewers, to be replaced by evangelical programming and reality TV shows. In the end, the film is about how hard news was once, as Rather says at the end, a big draw for viewership. Americans had an insatiable appetite for the truth. The Watergate Hearings in the summer of 1973 was the top rated show of the summer. I am old enough to remember the days when ""60 Minutes"" was the number one viewed show for years in a row. This was when most Americans had only 4 or 5 networks on TV to pick from (the big three, plus an independent station or two, and PBS; Fox did not arrive until much later). The elimination of the FCC Fairness Doctrine in 1987 by the Reagan Administration allowed news networks to air on cable presenting woefully one-sided material without a requirement to present the other side. This led to Fox News on the right, and MSNBC on the left (although I would argue MSNBC does in fact present the other side with Morning Joe and other conservative- leaning anchors). Fox News does not...liberal guests or, in the case of Alan Colmes, anchors, were there to be whipping material, and were shouted down or cut off completely by the conservatives.We are now living in an era of over 500 cable channels, not to mention the internet (and the internet will probably be the one place where Americans can get unfiltered truthful journalism; that is, if the Trump administration does not eliminate net neutrality). Americans are more interested in sports, reality TV, and Game of Thrones, and have been turned off by the news, with the exception of the 70+ Fox News addicts out there (who are akin to heroin addicts). When Dish Network threatened to drop Fox News from their roster, because NewsCorp raised the rates (and it was Dish's free market decision to do so), I saw posts by Fox News addicts complaining that they could not sleep ""without their fix of Fox News."" Thanks to this brainwashing, the New York Times, Washington Post, NPR, Time Magazine, etc. have been dubbed ""fake news,"" while the National Enquirer and New York Post are trusted by this group as ""legitimate."" Something the real Rather has been fairly vocal about. But I digress. If they could turn back time, would Mapes, Rather, and CBS had waited until after the election to present the story, or not, if the sources had been revealed to be inaccurate as they were? Who knows. It is a fascinating story, and although many right wingers in my family adamantly refuse to watch the film because of its story, the ""liberal actors,"" and their irrational hatred of Dan Rather (""a traitor and a commie"" to them), the movie is not the extreme left wing film they may imagine. The Oscar-winning ""Spotlight"" actually had more of a left slant than ""Truth.""Robert Redford as Dan Rather is a revelation. Redford doesn't look much like Rather, but he's mastered Rather's mannerisms and vocal style in the same way Christopher Plummer mastered Mike Wallace in ""The Insider."" Seeing this film some 40 years after ""All the President's Men"" was released is also interesting; how much news has changed, regardless of media outlet. And Cate Blanchett as Mapes...what can I say, an incredible performance. Watch out Meryl Streep--Cate Blanchett is on your heels as the greatest female actor on the planet today. The film could have been a little longer to flesh out some characters (Moss more or less disappears after the first half), but highly recommended. Especially in this era when ""facts"" are being deemed as ""fake news"" by the current President, while conspiracy theories (as the Republicans called the story Mapes broke in 2004) are being called ""real news."" I didn't hear a fraction of the anger the Republicans displayed in 2004 from the Democrats when Fox News called Barack Obama a ""non American."""
" The early rumblings of fake news
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,7,"NO SPOILERS- The story, script and direction keep this movie moving along at a decent pace which is a good thing because it's excruciating to look at Redford(who looks 90)as Dan Rather- I think someone else should have been cast for this part. BUT(and that's a big but), watch this movie to see Cate perform, who I am becoming convinced has taken the field, and is now the best female actor in the business."
" ""Rathergate"". Too interesting to miss!
",2017-04-13 00:00:00,8,"This is a dramatic re-creation of the fall from grace of CBS news anchor Dan Rather (Robert Redford). Controversy swells after erroneous reporting is blamed on newscaster Dan Rather and his CBS News head Mary Mapes (Cate Blanchett) following a segment on 60 Minutes exposing how President George W. Bush received preferential treatment to avoid being drafted to the Vietnam War. The aftermath's bottom line cost their highly respected jobs. The R rated presentation also features a cast including: Dennis Quaid, Elisabeth Moss, Topher Grace, Dermont Mulroney, Stacy Keach, Bruce Greenwood and Rachel Blake."
" A lead reporter with ""issues"" trips over herself, brings down the mighty
",2017-03-13 00:00:00,2,"The movie is about a reporter played by Cate Blanchett, who uses some really questionable documents as proof for a story she wants to believe, then gets stung by the blogosphere. Cate is doing a piece about Bush in the National Guard, but proof pivots on some really ghetto looking documents. It doesn't help that the guy providing the them looks like the kind who would run over your foot at Walmart on his rascal scooter, then you would feel too sorry for him to complain because his oxygen tank fell off the cart. The docs sort of look like they were faked by an 8th grader too.The movie is not so much a historical piece, because it is so biased toward Dan Rather and Blanchett's characters. It is more of a feminist statement gone haywire.. It would be like if Blanchett entered a teen bikini contest to protest it's objectifying women, then was aghast when she didn't win. No matter the crowd ran out screaming, she entered to make a point, damn it, and you had better look!!! ""OK, OK, maybe I can't prove the story, but I just know it's true!!!!!""The reporter is the type Blanchett was was born to play. Big , bossy, brutish bitchy and blonde, she not so much works but more elbows her way thru the film . In addition she has all the props- wimpy house hubby, special needs type son (only ONE kid, natch), bad knock off of a Tudor house and sensible shoes--YIKES! It's no wonder she got fired, I kept worrying she was gonna get murdered. She has issues, MAJORLY, and they are of the deep rooted Daddy variety. She wasn't gonna ever end up on a stripper pole ( for obvious reasons), so instead she goes out hunting for revenge, but instead of her bod uses a pen, with mixed results.I remember when Dan Rather got his first mega media star contract, decades ago but well into seven figures. In the film, they ask him why he went into ""journalism"". He should have answered ""you call this journalism""? but instead quipped ""curisosity""......yea, right. ? Remember that line from the film "" Broadcast News"", when the guy asked his father ""what can you do if all you can do is look good?"" A square jaw and veneer job can sure come in handy. hey Danny?"
" When Reporting was still good
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,8,"Not all of it that is, but you still had some people with integrity. People who may get disillusioned by what hardships they have to face for reporting the truth. And others who try to detract from the actual points that are being made. Of course you can see this as another piece/attack on President Bush. But that would be narrow minded, because while he is the main target of the story (and you could say that there are a lot of analogies to the soon to be POTUS), the heart of it is more than that.And having these actors in it portraying actual people is something that helps and elevates the movie. It's tough to not like them, for their passion, for their love of their job. And it's hard not to feel their pain and or joy depending on how successful they are or the obstacles they have to face. A very engaging movie, that takes you in ... about something at least I wasn't fully aware of"
" Daddy, please stop.
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,4,"This film is bad.This film feels a lot like that year's Spotlight, only with a much worse script and less competent direction. So far as the acting is concerned, where to place the blame is a bit difficult. It just feels awkward sometimes. That awkwardness, though often due to clunky delivery, is largely derived from the dialogue. Vanderbilt doesn't seem to know how to write it. A lot of the double speak Cate Blanchett's character uses to address both her abusive past and her journalistic struggles is heavy handed and obvious. Nothing is subtle. Certain lines are clichéd to the point of being cartoonish (""don't you understand?""). While the dialogue and direction I feel pretty well explains middling performances from competent actors like Blanchett and Redford, sometimes actors are just bad. There's even a bad child actor. Not all children are bad at acting. Some are very good. They are like any other actor and should be judged on more or less the same standard as their adult counterparts. With that in mind, the child actor in Truth is still bad. Like his adult peers it isn't all his fault, some of his lines are just terrible. The bad adult acting suffers the same, though the flat delivery really doesn't help. Flatness is not the only problem though. Like I alluded to with Blanchett's character's heavy handed double speak, Vanderbilt is not good with subtly. At one point he seems to doubt so much that his audience gets the point that he dedicates a three minute speech to a character basically laying out his political opinion just so we don't miss the point of his two hour movie. It's honestly a little surprising that an experienced screenwriter feels he has to resort to it. It's not surprising that this is Vanderbilt's directorial debut. While the direction of the actors is generally not the best, most other aspects of the film just go to show his inexperience. There is visually nothing interesting. The cinematography is generally flat and the only variation in shots is how centered or balanced they are, which, given the somewhat stale office setting much of the film takes place in, isn't really that impressive. The lighting, color, and set design are all serviceable, nothing more. There didn't seem to be any thought to having the visuals of the film play any real role in telling the story (There is one shot which does show a power imbalance purely through the way a large number of characters are situated across the protagonist, demonstrating the odds being stacked against her, but honestly I wouldn't be surprised if this was coincidental given the pattern for the rest of the film).Given that Vanderbilt has a lot more experience with screen writing than he does directing, it's not surprising that he felt comfortable using spoken word alone to tell this story, but then what's the point in making it into a film? The only other way to really enhance the story through the medium would be with its music. It's too bad then that the score is totally bland and forgettable and is really more working in the background than enhancing or transforming the emotional weight of a given scene. When this film is not mediocre it is bad. It does almost nothing to utilize the medium of film and makes me question why Vanderbilt didn't just keep to the writing and leave the direction to someone more competent. Maybe if you have strong feelings on Bush you'll find yourself ignoring how bad it is. I think though, if you look at this thing objectively, you'll realize it wasn't worth your time."
