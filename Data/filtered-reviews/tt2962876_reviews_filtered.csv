" Portrays some illnesses accurately
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,6,There's no doubt that the script writing was done poorly. There are 3 main character and only one was dynamic. Many missed opportunities to shed light on the other two illnesses. I believe that the actors themselves did well with what was given to them. I'm not sure if the Tourette's was played accurately but I'm well aware that the OCD and anorexia well portrayed very well. Though the poor script diminishes the well-done portrayal because the characters have no story. They aren't written to throughly talk about their illnesses and it's affect on their lives. The road trip cliches were also added in but some were made necessary for the ending. I believe this had potential to be greater then what it was but not as bad as most are making it out to be.
" All and all an enjoyable adventure.
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,8,"The few movies that catch our heart not necessarily by their story but their characters; this movie has indeed made its place in that list. This movie with its interesting and extraordinary characters made a simple story compelling to the audience. As the story goes on, audience gets involved with the characters. If you are expecting some thrill or plot twist, you are in the wrong place my friend.Director Grand Wells has chosen this movie for his debut which is basically the remake of the German movie ""Vincent Wants to Sea"". Vincent's life, a teenager with tourette syndrome, shattered after the sudden death of his mother. His father enrolls him in an experimental home/clinic for special children. There he stole Dr Rose's car and escaped from that home with his new friend Marie, a girl with eating disorder. Alex, his roommate and an OCD patient, also joined them by accident. They decided to go to the ocean where Vincent can scatter his mother's ash.Three teenagers wih totally diverse personality, totally different philosophy towards life start a remarkable journey while they are chased by Vincent's furious father and a tensed Dr. Rose. Will they reach their destination??"
" Bland script and feeble storytelling has this going nowhere.
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,2,"The critics all panned this and now I can see why. Should've read the critic's reviews BEFOREHAND so I wouldn't have wasted my time watching this on prime.What really irks me is that lots of people live with these diseases, and they tend to do it with a lot more grace than this movie possesses. This film trivializes and makes a mockery of these afflictions. It's simply lazy writing and lack of research. The characters in this are completely defined by their respective challenges. Not one of them seem to have a personality. They just have illness. And that completely rings false. And the person who directed this clearly didn't have the slightest notion of what they were doing. I wonder if Kyra Sedgewick realized what she was signing up for. A shame."
" Truly an amazing experience
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,10,"Although some say this film is boring, I believe that it was a beautiful heartwarming story.I absolutely love robert sheehan, I love a lot of stuff hes been in like, the umbrella academy and misfits. Hes truly an amazing actor so that made this even better.This film isnt exactly action packed so if you like that sort of thing I wouldn't recommend it but if you like something more about characters finding themselves and discovering who they are ,I truly would. The only thing I was confused about was the character of alex it looked like he had feelings for Vincent but it was only very subtle. I heard someone say that Vincent just leaves Marie at the end but no he doesn't as in the last scene hes telling alex they'll go see her the next day."
" Great hidden gem.
",2020-03-22 00:00:00,8,"I watch a lot of movies on Prime. Every so often, these little gems pop up that I have never known existed. Anything with Dev Patel or Robert Sheehan in is usually worth watching and Zoe Kravitz's performance was an added bonus.Not sure why there were a few poor reviews but then every film is not for everyone.Whilst I laughed out loud at some of the situations, I did have a voice asking whether it was appropriate to make light of these devastating conditions. However, the way it resolves in the end just satisfied me enough that it was worth it.Definitely recommend a watch."
" Sponsored by Marlboro
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,1,"Idiotically emotional story line. It's like corn syrup or msg. You get this flavor in every American production. Poorly factual on the psychological disorders which I find a bit disrespectful. All in all yet another American film for entertaining someone who likes Spider Man. Not my cup of tea. I decided watching it for Sheehan because he is quite picky with his work but this one was clearly a mistake. Just stop the movie at 1:23:03. This movie is as successful as that product placement. Sorry Robert, no matter what you do the ones we hate will be the ones who pay the best."
" Very bad story. It isn't movie.
",2020-01-02 00:00:00,1,"I see actors trying hard, cameramen doing their job, but this story can't make it.
Very low, uninteresting script that would get F mark in highschool."
" My Review- It's a funny and sad movie
",2019-06-22 00:00:00,7,"I just decided to watch because of Robert Sheehan and his acting.
I couldn't stop laughing...
It is worth to watch this movie if you don't have anything to see.
I empathized with and I felt related within the son the main character and dad relationship."
" A Powerful Must Watch Story
",2019-03-03 00:00:00,9,"I stumbled upon this little indy movie and I am so glad that I did. Illnesses like Tourettes and OCD are often portrayed in movies as a comic effect, or something very small-scale like occasional cursing or refusing to touch a dirty door handle, when in reality these illnesses are often crippling for those who suffer from them. I have never seen a movie that portrayed these illnesses, particularly Tourettes, in such a realistic light. Robert Sheehan and Dev Patel are absolute powerhouses in this film, portraying their respective illnesses with such realism that I absolutely believed them to be real. The story is fairly simple, but the acting is what really brings this film to life. It is at times extremely painful to watch, particularly the beginning as we are introduced to the characters, and as an audience member it is difficult to watch these young men struggle with very serious issues and aspects of their illnesses.
I think this movie is an absolute triumph, and a must watch in order to gain a new perspective into those who are suffering from illnesses that are often taken much too lightly."
" Best movie for people like me
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,10,People with tourette's will definately love this movie .
" Manipulative Rubbish
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,3,"This is another example of where the score shown on IMDb (in this case 7.1) is no indication at all of the merit of a movie. Usually, my own rating is within a hair of the IMDb score; not in this case.
This was 96 minutes of Hell for me. I didn't warm to any of the characters at all and I actively disliked most of them.
Please, before anyone accuses me of not understanding or of being insensitive to mental illness, I am personally acquainted with it and have a much better understanding than most.
This terrible movie made OCD and Tourette's syndrome look almost like fun; I have the impression that we were supposed to laugh every time Vincent went into one of his unconvincing profane rants or when Alex's OCD manifested in some particularly silly way. It probably wasn't the film-makers' intention to belittle the suffering of individuals affected by these conditions. But, all the same, this movie had at least the appearance of a comedy despite the fact that I didn't laugh even once. I had a complete lack of sympathy for the three sufferers and a dreadful desire for this lot of tripe just to end.
Thankfully, I didn't pay much for the DVD. It's not one I'll ever watch again, so very poor was the movie.
Please don't waste your time on this crap."
" Awesome!
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,9,"This is a truly beautiful and tender film. It Portrays three individuals with quite severe mental illnesses, and shows all of us a path to recovery via compassion and a sense of humor. The script is fantastic, and the acting/directing is sublime.Zoe Kravitz and Dev Patel are artists to be admired, but they outdo themselves in this film."
" A beautiful, sympathetic look into the dark world of mental illness
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,8,"I was absolutely blown away by this movie. I thought it was brilliantly done and is award worthy. Definitely a must see, especially for those suffering from any form of mental illness within their lives.I had never seen any of these actors before but I thought they did an amazing job. I can definitely see how some people could be put off by this movie but you need to have an open mind and an understanding heart to truly appreciate it.I love movies with a parent vs. child struggle and I love it even more when both the parent and child learn a lesson in the end and are able to settle their differences and see eye to eye. You are able to feel for all of the characters and the writing is truly poetic.My favorite part in the movie was how music positively effected the moods of Alex and Vincent. I have heard that music can effect our brainwaves and I found it amazing that this was so comforting for them.The only reason I am not giving it a perfect score is because I wish they had chosen to portray OCD in a manner aside from the ""germ phobia."" This is the most commonly depicted form of OCD but it is by far the most common. OCD manifests in many different ways and I wish they had chosen to illustrate that more in Alex. But I still think his transformation was brilliantly done.There are definitely some disturbing elements of the movie but I feel that the beauty and growth that the characters experience far outweigh any of their tragedies."
