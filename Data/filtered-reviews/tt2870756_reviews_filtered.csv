" One more great film by Woody Allen
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Excellent romantic comedy. Great laughs, very clever dialogs, charming atmosphere, smart script that makes you change your kind many times, as if you were the character. Woody Allen did it again! Colin Firth has an excellent performance, and Emma Stone obviously goes well too."
" the script was moving me on a personal level
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,7,"Til a certain point, it was very nice to watch this film. The photography and the direction fascinated me, and the script was moving me on a personal level, making me see, from a different perspective, a little bit of my recent mental and spiritual evolution was like.After the prayer scene at the hospital, the film grew stronger and tense because of the protagonist's doubts, and for a moment I thought the message of the whole work was to praise skepticism. But that view just made me get cheated again by the script.Ultimately, you need to know the secrets to know how to truly love. And that some experiences only serve to shape our personality and the way we see things."
" I wanted i better! A cute cliche movie with some hints of clever thinking!
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,6,"Plot:A romantic comedy about an Englishman brought in to help unmask a possible swindle. Personal and professional complications ensue.Analysis:I am a fan of Woody Allen's work, I think his understanding of style and beuaty is brilliant, most of his works are very clever and deep, they spark with creativity and even those who doesn't, they have at least something unique and philosophical behind them. Sadly, this movie belongs in the second category and it could definetely be a hit if it wasn't a weird mix of very cliché romantic comedy stuff with some Woody Allen clever ideas.I think I can't describe this movie well-enough. On one hand it should be a totally mediocre story but instead, those little elements Allen does make it.. Cute?.. I think this is a suitable word for that. I am pretty sure everyone will be able to anticipate what is going to happen, there are not many surprises and seems like one of the least impressive stories he has ever written. At times, there are themes that were tackled like if being rational and seaking for the truth is worth the misery and the bad mood, or whether it is okay to think irrational sometimes, when do feelings and instinct overcome the rational way of thinking, all of those were pretty interesting stuff but I would rather watch them in a movie with a more clever plot, this is the classic formula of romantic comedy just a little bit enhanced.Visually, Magic In The Moonlight is obviously beautiful and absolutely astonishing to watch. Those beautiful landscapes, the way Allen uses sunlight to create atmosphere, the beauty of nature and the classic elegance of that age, they are all things that made this a lot more interesting than it should be. Watching something that touches your heart with the amazing picture is a positive feeling that does help this movie to be above average.Both Emma Stone and Colin Firth did their best with the roles they had. Emma plays a charming young lady and manages to be exactly what the movie needed, she is gorgeous to look at, she has cute reactions that match the character's personality and she can be really good at casual roles. On the other hand, Colin Firth had to be really abnoxious, his character is a rationalist who doesn't only hold into his pessimistic opinions but has a snubbish look on everyone who chooses something different, he is a misanthrope and that is obviously what makes the anithtesis with the young lady. Colin did a great job, he is usually the more serious and clashy guy, but this role was something way more challenging, he managed to be not just good, but quite memorable due to his abillity on making you despise him for his attitude but still finding him charming, a very good performance in a movie that was probably a little bit too mediocre as a story for that effort.Conclusion:I don't hate this movie, this could be actually really good, I am just disappointed it wasn't. There were many good things, it's was pretty, it had some great acting moments, Allen had some great ideas but it needed a little more effort to be pleasing. Unfortunately, I wasn't completely satisfied from this film and it's a pitty because I really wanted a good movie that deals with issues like these.Rating: 6.5/10"
" Age difference a put-off
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,3,Cute movie. Good acting. The double your age romance is a put-off.
" Loved the set decor, wardrobe, scenery and music.
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,8,"Woody Allen knows how to create the mood, yet again. I loved the period in which this rather flimsy story was made. I liked Emma Stone, Colin Firth flirting! The movie didn't require a lot of thought, just enjoy it for what it is."
" A Winner
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,10,"What's your criteria for judging a movie's worth? How do you 'rate' films. Here's a five point system I use:
1. It has to look good. The cinematography, the shots the pacing...they're most important.
2. I have to care about the story or the characters. The storyline is second only to the visual.
3. On some level it has to make sense. Even if it's a suspension of disbelief story, it has to be believable in its own context.
4. It should be well acted.
5. The score should add to the film's presentation.Magic in the Moonlight gets high marks in all five areas. See this film. Let it wash over you. Listen to the dialogue. Emjopy the camera work and the scenery."
" Movie Perfection
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,10,"I declared this movie as my favorite after watching. It bumped Dangerously Liaisons right out of my top spot.Everything about this movie was beautiful, brilliant and perfect: casting, setting, location, acting, costumes, music, storyline, character development. Even the ending, which has always been Allen's weak point, was lovely.It's Woody Allen's best work, in my opinion."
" Not so magical but rather generic
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,2,"Magic in the moonlight is anything but magical. The story starts off with an interesting but rather typical premise about a magician (Colin Firth) act wanting to disprove the authenticity of another magician (Emma Stone) claiming by others that she is the real thing.Here this film takes place in the 1920's so the dialogue consists mostly of Colin Firth speaking intelligently and witty, with the typical British mannerisms. After a while it got dull.This film doesn't seem to go anywhere in which we don't see. Labeled as a romantic comedy and it was as predictable as they come. First both leads are in relationships with other people then once they start spending time with one another, they fall for another, end eventually end up with each other.Very few scenes of any magic and when the obvious ""twist"" was revealed, there wasn't exactly much to look forward to in the end. What we received is quite a dull, bland and at many times a boring feature."
" Quirky but Quick
",2020-05-07 00:00:00,6,"Another quirky flick by Woody Allen! It was enjoyable, funny, and had me guessing most of the movie with a good twist ending. The romance aspect was just slightly forced and quick. There isn't much development between the character's relationship before they're suddenly in love. It kind of made it feel like puppy love, or inauthentic. Though it was a fun film that I would watch again on a rainy day just to laugh and feel sappy!"
" Ugg a bad remake of pride and prejudice
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,4,Colin Firth I adore and Emma Stone is a stunningly good actress but neither of them seem remotely in love or challenged by the other in this badly rewritten pride and prejudice or dumb and dumber Bridget Jones esq film rip off. Colin Firth plays a magician and Emma is a medium who he endeavours to debunk. The one shoddy seance and the odd tibets of personal info she throws out are obviously contrived but somehow Firth thinks it's all real then he doesn't then he does lol boring. As far a a comedy about wealth or faith that some reviewers are spouting its pretty obvious both men are wealthy so she can take the wealthy young one or the obviously wealthy old one hummm not sure why she decided how she did maybe the young guy was too tiring she seemed to like sitting on swings and reading. Woody Allen should stop making movies trying to justify his young girl wife and not drag all these good actors through the muck! I would have given a one but I do usually love these actors!
" Thanks to the lovely scenery & GREAT cast but oh so maudlin!
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,4,"Woody Allen is tired and sentimental in his old age. He is now a pastiche of himself and a pretty syrupy one at that. The actors in all his films end up playing nothing more than an extension of Allen's ego and it seems to become more and more so as he enters his twilight years.He now just recycles and does variations on his other movies and in this case, it's something of Woody Allen meets Oscar Wilde-as-dilettante. The great actors in this picture are actually kind of incidental. As always, INCREDIBLE cast but they could have been played by soap actors!! So marvelous to see Simon McBurney, Aileen Atkins and Jackie Weaver...and poor Marcia Gay Harden, may as well have not even been in it...her part is so throw away! Allen squanders the talent he casts and that's more and more so as time goes on.I wish Allen had something new to say; instead he's now so far up himself that he has forgotten who he was and what his charms were and how witty his insights were. It breaks my heart but I really just find his work to be disastrously recycled and THAT is about it. Thanks to the gorgeous scenery and what little the cast have to do here...it's the only thing the flick has going for it."
" Stayed with it for 45 minutes :\
",2019-10-19 00:00:00,1,"So I did watch the first 45 minutes, then switched it off and watched an episode of The Durrells instead.
While watching The Durrells, I came back to wondering why I didn't like what I saw of Magic in the Moonlight.
Firstly, I found the tone of the movie kind of nasty, mean-spirited. I don't know if this is supposed to be a sneer at stately British manners, or of period pieces taking place in Britain, or a send-off of old British movies. Or is it supposed to be a love letter to any of the above? It doesn't work as any of these things. Why would Woody Allen spend the time and money to make a mocking film, if that's the case. Don't know. At any rate, as I said, it is not successful as any of these types of film.
Anyhow, I found the acting wooden. I didn't find any of the characters to be sympathetic. I didn't care what happened to them. I love Colin Firth, the rest of the cast was wonderful too, maybe with the exception of Emma Stone. She's won an Oscar, so I expect she's a good actress, but I didn't feel that she was up to this role, unless again the problem is with the direction.
This could have been a really nice little film, or even a successful comment on a period in British culture, but in this film anyway, Woody Allen is no Robert Altman. It just made me sad :\"
" Romance running on idle - one of Allen's duds
",2019-08-15 00:00:00,3,"It is clear that Allen wrote the main character with himself in mind. The neurotic babbling in the dialogue shows this way to often. It just doesn't suit Colin Firth at all, and it brings down the whole experience with him in the leading role. Owen Wilson might have pulled it off, like he did in Midnight in Paris, but Firth? No.Other than that, it s a film that certainly isn't lacking beautiful scenery and clothes, but it does lack attention to detail and more than often feels rushed in its production and editing. Some scenes ends too abrutply. On many occasions the emotions of the characters isn't accentuated by close ups (and acting!). And to keep a magical shimmer throughout, the photographer decided to always shoot at 6 pm to catch that setting sun light, regardless of the actual time in the story. At 3 pm in one scene, the characters casts long shadows on the cliffs for example. Details perhaps, but still annoying. And for the romance part, there is no spark whatsoever- Firth again to blame, so the whole idea with the film falls flat.Stone, McBurney and Atkins are great in their roles, especially with the flawed material they had to work with. The others are forgettable."

" not very interesting
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,3,"HERE BE SPOILERS - READERS BEWARE...In ""Magic in the Moonlight"", a professional stage magician is asked to enquire into the life and times of a young lady said to be a genuine medium. It's a neat premise and it could have given rise to a bundle of jokes and witty observations. Sadly, the jokes and witty remarks are few and far apart. By the same token, there isn't much in the way of suspense or thrills. This is a pretty boring movie, where the period detail is asked to do much of the heavy lifting.At least part of the boredom stems from the lazy characterizations. Our professional magician, for instance, is an atheist, a cynic and a sourpuss, with all three qualities being closely linked together. Surely this is a string of clichés ? In this world, there are many people who do not believe in some kind of deity or religion, but who have a happy nature and a positive, adventurous approach to life. Meanwhile millions of other people go through life being both deeply religious and deeply bored or depressed.Moreover, a radical unwillingness to be lied to is a fine moral attribute which adorns both believers and non-believers.Near the end, our magician protagonist falls for the pretty medium, although by now he knows what he suspected from the outset, to wit that she is a fraud. The movie spins this as a happy event, implying not only that lovers cannot be but foolish, but also that every human needs a good dose of illusion and enchantment. There's an element of falsehood here - raking in money by defrauding the old and defenceless is radically different from spinning amusing tales, providing harmless entertainment or offering spiritual comfort.Apart from that, some nice acting, nice locations and nice music."
" *Sigh*
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,5,Emma Stone and Colin Firth do their with Woody Allen's uninspired screenplay.
" Not Classic Woody Allen But Still Charming
",2019-04-09 00:00:00,8,"When it comes to direction, Woody Allen wears many hats. It's just a matter of which hat he's wearing. Whether it be rather serious affairs like ""Manhattan"" or ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" to the more farce driven tales like ""Curse of the Jade Scorpion"" and ""Everyone Says I Love You"". After the success of 2013 Oscar winning comedy-drams ""Blue Jasmine"", Allen decides to with a more lighter fare romantic comedy ""Magic in the Moonlight"".Woody Allen seems more accustomed to European settings which has been quite frequent since 2005. Set in the year, 1928, we have the mysterious illusionist and professional exploiter Stanley Crawford (Colin Firth) was preparing for a sabbatical when he was called upon by his confidante who is also an illusionist named Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney) to travel to Cote D'Azur on the French Riviera to debunk the mystified psychic named Sophie Baker (Emma Stone) and to reveal her secrets. She appears to have the gift of communicating with the dead and the dark roots hidden from rich European aristocrats. So he sends Stanley on this mission to get as much information on her if she's authentic or if she's a fraud. Stanley has experience worldwide going under the name Wei Ling Soo no one even knows his real identity. So going by his alter-ego and unlock her secrets he will stop at nothing to reveal the fraud she really is.This is where he's introduced to Sophie and she seems to have the uncanny ability to actually uncover hidden truths from these wealthy civilians and Stanley seems impressed with her, but is still skeptical even though the trickery she performs doesn't seen to have no real subterfuge. Stanley seems to question time again if this so-called fraud the real deal.Allen seems to have the historical context pertaining to the old school style of magic and illusions that was quite popular in in the 1920's. In some ways, Firth shares similar idiosyncrasies to the like of the legendary Harry Houdini who also specialized in revealing the truths from mediums who allegedly can communicate with the paranormal. The costumes truly fit the time period and being the aficionado of the old school jazz era music, that too comes alive in this film that's a classic staple in Woody Allen movies.The romantic interlocking between Stanley and Sophie never comes to mind here. It's only a matter when Stanley takes his mind off socializing with the dead and shifting his way into the lust he has with this talented medium. Firth just seems naturally at home with his performance as he's done these roles many times before. Meanwhile Stone has the rich, believable aura about her that has the right amount of charm to blend into the 1920's atmosphere. But aside from Firth, Stone and McBurney, the supporting cast also adds to the charm of colourful characters as the light up the screen. We have Hamish Linklater as Brice who like to serenade Sophie with love songs accompanied with his ukulele. Jacki Weaver is also very wonderful as a widowed Grace who is curious about the contacts with the dead regardless if it's true or a hoax. Eileen Atkins is also whimsical as Stanley's Aunt Vanessa who seems to like this Sophie character.Come in this film with low expectations and you'll be fine. In fact is showcases just hoe versatile Woody Allen truly is. Aside from the world of magic and illusion, as well as the humour, romance and decor, ""Magic in the Moonlight"" is photographic the whole way through. From Emma Stone's flapper to Firth's tuxedo to lovely view of the French Riviera and the exquisite mansion there's more to like about this movie. Sure it's not in the same level of classic films of Woody Allen's, but it's a little something to saviour the moments."
" A Whimsical Delight that Leaves You Better Off
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,9,"I truly don't understand the negative reviews. This film was whimsical, with the right amount of cynicism - an absolute delight with a genuinely unpredictable twist. To say this film was pleasant from start to finish would be an understatement.I don't believe I stopped smiling throughout its entirety - I was in awe, and I certainly didn't have high hopes for this film as I've been going through Colin Firth's filmography, this has been towards the end of my list, but much like Firth's character, I'm not ashamed to admit I was wrong.This also highlights a character I've come to favor in all aspects of life. One that is pessimistic, sarcastic, rational, held back by their own stubbornness and is shut off to the idea that life can be enjoyable, yet has the potential to be entirely changed - the most pleasant opposite - a person that is often overlooked and deemed unchangeable. If only someone were to come along and shake up their stance, we would find a pearl in the rough. A person, that as Sophie said, is ""rather obnoxious, but not entirely unappealing"" - a character that Colin Firth plays very well.I don't know what it is about a Woody Allen film, but it has a way of being just the right amount of romantic, witty, narcissistic, realistic, dry, timely - it's everything I want out of a theatrical escape, and I've come to see it as the precise aesthic my mind is constantly caught up in, longing for and romanticizing."
" Lovely romantic comedy in which Emma Stone is as beautiful as an oasis in a grim desert and Colin Firth is his usual English clumsy self. Just lovely, lovely.
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,8,"Woody Allen is a pessimist, yet he keeps churning out all these romantic movies as an antidote against the cruel and rational world he lives in. And this movie is exactly about that subject which relates to all those people who have to believe in something magical out there in order to keep their lives bearable.The story? Emma Stone is a psychic fortune teller who can read people's minds. Colin Firth a rational man who wants to reveal that Emma is a fraud. Will he succeed in revealing the truth or will something entirely else and more lovely start to blossom during his investigation?Emma Stones eyes have never seem bluer and Colin Firth is his usual English clumsy self. Those 2 actors are a comedy match made in a romantic heaven and the result called ""Magic in the Moonlight"" is just lovely, lovely. Suited for all ages, for anyone who just wants to have a laugh and dream away with a romantic movie with a terrific feel good vibe."
" Delightfully Magical
",2019-01-15 00:00:00,9,"18 December 2014. Among the most magical elements of this delightful movie is its un-Woody Allen like quality. Never a big fan of this amazing director, Allen has demonstrated a superior, qualitative ability in directing and photographing this supremely cerebral, witty, and plot-driven movie.Each scene possesses a charming color palette, with vivid colors, hues, and tones, shadows and sun highlights that vibrate the visual senses adding even more life to the actors. The extended dialogue that Allen is known for isn't typical Allen dialogue, but much more elegantly natural in its content and delivery. The plot is also more subtle and the twists more creatively sedate but powerful.This seriocomic romance movie charms with its delivery, making it one of the most enthralling, mysterious romance period movies of the year. Magic might be considered a more low-key version of the more mainstream Saving Mr. Banks (2013) or the comic version of American Beauty (2000)."
" Colin Firth brought down this film
",2018-10-18 00:00:00,5,"Firstly I'm a Woody Allen fan. I like most of his movies and love a few. But this is perhaps the worst Woody Allen movie I've ever seen - and I've seen about 30 of them.The positives: Cinematography and color palettes were gorgeous. Emma Stone was brilliant, believable, compelling and radiant. The plot was innovative and relatively original.The Negatives: There's only one. There was zero chemistry between Emma Stone and Colin Firth.
The responsibility for that falls largely, if not entirely, on Colin Firth's shoulders. Any critic who gave this a Metascore of 100 or a 10 in IMDB has either never really been in love or was watching an entirely different movie - or in the case of the media critics, were paid off. I honestly can't see it any other way. Very disappointing."
" think of life
",2018-08-19 00:00:00,7,"The whole life, you spent publicly against spiritualism, and then,you'd have to come out with it and say that you were wrong. Yes, this movie is the one about spiritualism and containing something about China in Woody Allen's movie."
" Boring + Huge Age Gap
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,1,"This movie is not only boring but also has the icky, makes you wanna barf kinda HUGE age gap between the couple.. I think it's only fit for Woody Allen. I really find this so bald when you married your girlfriends adopted child and while everyone talks about you're a child molester.. Guy has the nerve.. Sorry but we are in 2010's and maybe your children is so brainwashed and to be able to get married to you with this age gap, no self assured woman has this kinda age gap in her romantic life.. How can the audience find them attractive together he is like her father?! The only reason I watched this because I wanted to watch Emma Stone but now I'm not sure that I wanna watch her anymore.."
" A Starchy Rom-Com
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,4,"I saw another Woody Allen film, ""Wonder Wheel"" just the other day. I was overwhelmed by Kate Winslet's performance even if the film is not one of Allen's best, Kate Winslet makes it a must so I started searching for other Woody Allen films that I may have missed. Magic in the Moonlight (2014) I didn't even know this movie existed and it has Colin Firth in the lead. Colin Firth has been a favorite actor of mine since Apartment Zero (1988) and Emma Stone won the Oscar last year. I organized my evening to enjoy every minute of this unexpected treat. Well. the film looks wonderful and it has Eileen Atkins in it but the romantic aspect of the tale left me completely cold. Emma Stone projects discomfort more than anything else and Colin Firth performs as if he was on a stage. Every line is recited and their chemistry is also acted. By not believing in them the entire film felt like a plodding attempt at something that never materializes. Maybe next time."
" Simply magic
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,10,"Loved it brilliantly written by a genius Woody Allen one of my favorites. I loved the story it kept me captivated the story well done with a nice twist.Woody Allen at his best, and I loved Colin Firths character he does so well. It doesn't start off as a romance but ends up as one.The female lead played a brilliant part, and shamefully i do have to say i worked out the plot very quickly but it didn't spoil the film for me not at all."
" Magic in the Moonlight
",2017-07-31 00:00:00,4,"Magic in the Moonlight was an especially good-looking outing for Woody Allen in 2014. Despite its brilliant cinematography, however, the film didn't have much else to offer. Woody Allen explores well-traversed territory here when he follows a 1920's magician in his plot to expose a fraudulent spiritualist. His magician Colin Firth is an atheist, of course, and has no patience for reveling in the company of frauds. The spiritualist, Emma Stone, nearly has Firth's character convinced until he is brought back by his stubbornness which kept him from believing in anything more than the life we have on this earth. Magic in the Moonlight is certainly one of Woody's fluff pieces, but it's not as fun of a fluff piece as some others, most notably, Scoop. The film is notable as the only time Woody Allen comes close to giving into some kind of religion, though."
" Good!
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,7,"Sophie , challenges his rationality while bringing out the romantic side of him without his own awareness. The twists and turns are extremely logical and pleasant to watch as designed by Woody Allen's script and unbelievably delivered by these two great actors. It is almost like a suspense story and we are sucked in right from the beginning to follow the cast and explore together. Emma Stone shines with her charming eyes and smiles while Colin Firth reminds us of a young and babbling Woody Allen. As Sophie, Stanley and even Woody Allen make a living creating illusions, perhaps we are all living in a self-inflicted reality to help us get through life. But what's wrong with it if it enhances our senses, making us appreciate life and be happy? Maybe we do not really need to be so rational all the time. Let our body tell us what is happening (Stanley's tossing around at night). Just go with the flow and enjoy the ride that life throws at us."
" Decent Yet Shallow
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,7,"(Flash Review)This was a picturesque little movie that lightly touches a world- renowned magician who exposes fraudulent magicians and fortune tellers. He comes across on young woman who is very clever and needs to spend more time to figure out her illusions. If he can't figure her out, will he believe she is real and of course she is attractive so will a romance form? The story was OK but for me the climax was muted and the romantic angle a bit unbelievable. It was a visual pleasure and the illusions used were.nifty. Decent acting but the story was average and already slipping from memory."
" It wasn't magical at all
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,5,"This COULD have been a much better movie, easily.(Note: This review is a TOTAL SPOILER; I'm assuming you have already seen the movie and want to know whether you agree with me, or you don't care to avoid spoilers.)The scenery is crazy beautiful, and the first act is a nice setup. We know Stanley is going to fall for Sophie, and Howard is just the obsequious hand-wringer to put them together and then get out of the way. We just don't know how.The first act is great. I can't tell which characters are as they seem, and which ones are deceptive. The interplay between Stanley and Sophie is fun.But as soon as Sophie reveals she knew of Stanley's subterfuge -- which he did so that he could reveal HER subterfuge -- it begins to fall apart.After they visit Aunt Vanessa and she gets him to fall for the con, their borrowed roadster breaks down. After hours of fruitlessly attempting repairs, a downpour threatens to drench them both. They jump down a ravine and discover -- WHAT A LUCKY COINCIDENCE! -- they were next to an observatory that he visited more than once before. But he didn't recognize it before?Also, why is the observatory well-lit, fully powered, clean, and yet vacant? Whatever. I can let that go.Stanley is alone, facing a pretty, young, and totally dripping-wet woman who is putting his arm around her because she is chilled to the bone, and who just convinced him that she possessed actual clairvoyance. So he does what any man would naturally do.He takes a nap on a marble bench while she paces around. Yeah.He had to, because we needed a couple of hours for it to get dark AND for all the thunderclouds that had overcast the sky to vanish. When he awoke, Stanley opened the clamshell doors of the observatory. They happened to be standing precisely where they could see a beautiful, romantic crescent moon in a starry sky without moving a foot.There you go -- Magic in the Moonlight. Because  he's a magician? In moonlight?Except we find out that it wasn't romance. Later, she point-blank asks him, at a dance, whether he's ever thought of her ""as a woman."" He ruthlessly and coldly destroys the notion. Not even a hint of sympathy for her misunderstanding.I'm left thinking that he's gay, which would make this movie a LOT more interesting, or that he's playing a con of his own -- hunting the hunter, so to speak, which would also make it more interesting.But, no. I'm just going to cut to the chase. He does love her, we find out later. He's just an absolutely cold-blooded, egotistical jerk who only cares about himself. In fact, when he proposes to her, it's basically a suggestion to her that he will ""let her"" marry him, instead of the forgettable but incredibly wealthy puppy dog of a person who wants to give her everything in the world.What girl could resist a chance to run away from the lap of luxury and adoration in order to be with a guy who loves her enough to offer his lack of objection?There should have been plot twists around who conned who. Did she fool him? Did he fool her into thinking that she fooled him? Until the 3rd act, these seemed like possibilities.She did fool him. But he didn't discover he'd been fooled. He just abruptly decided that he was being fooled, during a monologue-y prayer for his Dear Aunt Vanessa.Not that it mattered. He decided that the same woman who helped torch his career with the Howard's assistance was the woman he would ""let"" marry him. The same woman who tricked him -- the ultimate skeptic -- into sincerely praying to God to save his Aunt Vanessa.Did he fool her into thinking that she fooled him? No, his only effort to fool her was in the first act -- a ham-handed job that she easily penetrated in the first act (even though we learned later that she already knew, thanks to snake-in-the-grass frenemy Howard). He just really sucks at dealing with love and romance, and would rather make her feel like an idiot than tell her that he might actually like her. Yeah, he's just helpless in his heart when it comes to her.And at the end of it all, do you know what's better than letting a filthy rich puppy dog give you anything you want for the rest of your life while he sings insipid songs at you? I'll tell you. It's being a 25-year-old world-wise professional con-artist woman who suddenly decides she's really, truly, totally in love with the 53- year-old curmudgeon she just finagled into throwing away his own spiritual awakening, who knows he can't trust her further than he can spit, and whose reputation and career she just trashed with the help of one his best friends. It's not that I think that May-December romances can't be fun to watch (not that I ever want one of my own -- I do not). Some Cary Grant movies are like that, and I enjoy them immensely. But they all have a lot more to offer in their characters and their stories than this movie had.This one had Woody Allen at the helm. That probably should have been enough of a warning.I really should have known better. Maybe I'll watch his earlier movies, but I'm done watching anything new from him."
" ""Whatever works"" reboot starring Mia Farrow lookalike
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,7,"The main character is similar to the one in ""Whatever works"", pessimistic and know-it-all ; he too reluctantly falls for a younger and less learned woman, which helps him see things under a different perspective. The girl happens to look quite like young Mia FarrowWoody Allen preferred to revisit this story as a period piece (the one of Gatsby) and in France where he seems to prefer to work recently. Happy-ending happens, but not the same way as ""Whatever works"" - no fall involved in the final twist...I personally prefer ""Whatever works"", due to richer intrigue and characters (and to Ms Wood...) ; however, this one's philosophic message (how to be optimistic...) is more developed"
" Someone must tell Woody: maybe you've lost it a little
",2017-04-21 00:00:00,4,"Oh dear, where to start? The plot, the acting, the direction, the dialogue, the characters? All of them are so utterly two-dimensional that quite soon watching Magic In The Moonlight becomes a chore. And whatever the film, whether comedy, tragedy, art-house, slapstick, watching it should never become a chore, whatever else it might be. And sadly as the man who came up with the plot, wrote the dialogue and directed the actors Woody Allen must take sole responsibility.I have seen several Woody Allen films, but too few to pass judgment on his career - as in whether or not he has lost his touch - but one thing I can suggest is that perhaps his films don't ever come alive if he isn't in them. Certainly he was in all the other films of his I've seen and none - though they are certainly from the earlier years of his career - dragged so limply as this Magic In The Moonlight.The plot: well, on paper it can neither be praised or damned. There's the old saying that it isn't the joke, but the way you tell it. So I'm quite prepared to accept that another director (perhaps one who isn't content to point his camera at stagey set pieces and have done with it - the only movement is a tracking shot, but that's it) might well have done something with what is otherwise a pedestrian plot.As for the acting, well, a the end of the day and with few exceptions actors are only as good as the direction they get and the material they have to work with. And here they are horribly short-changed. Wooden and stereotyped don't even begin to describe what we see. The same is true of the dialogue: to be blunt it is awful.Wit? There's none, though there are lines which I assume Allen thought might makes us chortle. In truth they are little more than a hack writer's pastiche of Oscar Wilde.I must confess that I am writing this halfway through watching the film, mainly to take a break from it. I shall go back to watching it - I shall, I promise - and perhaps somehow the whole sorry film will redeem itself. But I'm not holding my breath.Perhaps Allen has reached the stage where no producer dare tell him what he has written and how he is directing is mediocre. Well, if that's the case, I hope he reads this review. The whole thing is embarrassingly lame. There, Woody, I've said it. Sad, but true."
" ""Not another fake psychic...what a pestilence they are!""
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,6,"Although on the thin side, this romantic comedy set in 1928 turns out to be one of writer-director Woody Allen's better latter-day films. Colin Firth plays a British illusionist who performs successfully throughout the world under the guise of a Chinaman from the mystical Orient; he's an unbeliever in the spiritual world, however, and is therefore curious to meet the houseguest of a wealthy American family vacationing on the Riviera: an intuitive lass who claims to be an actual psychic. Firth's doubtful magician, an atheist who is amusingly brought to his knees in prayer after falling in love with telepathic Emma Stone, stands in for Woody Allen but doesn't do a Woody impersonation (a relief). Still, there's no magic between Firth and Stone as a movie-couple (they don't match up well), and the gaggle of comedic supporting characters bustling about the lush location haven't anything funny to do or say. Ultimately a benign film, but one that entertains in patches...and it's always enjoyable listening to Allen's dialogue, especially when his alter-ego continually weighs both sides of a situation without ever giving up his pessimistic nature. **1/2 from ****"
