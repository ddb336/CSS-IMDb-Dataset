" Not really a movie for me
",2021-04-01 00:00:00,2,"Not really a movie for anyone.I understand that cult stuff in movies and by far this was not a good execution.Acting was below average, jump scares not at all relevant. In full view of camera angles and script I don't really think this movie did a good job.It seemed to much like a rough draft and with a few more days in the work or a prewatch could of been improved."
" Screw all these high ratings
",2021-04-01 00:00:00,2,"This terrible acted, crap cinematography film, with a least than mediocre script and crap plot line does not deserve the ratings everyone is giving it. How on earth is this film at 5.8 not even my favorite crap horror movies deserve a 5.8.If you are looking to be disappointed after seeing this and wondering why it was rated so high then do so. But in all honesty the movie is at the very least a 2. And most possible 2.3."
" Boring and unrealistic
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,1,"Why didn't she just leave?! Why are people written so stupid in films just to keep the plot going? No one in reality would've stayed in that station once the ghostly things began happening. Only in fictional movie land are they that dumb. 1 star because for a ghost movie, there was zero suspense. And you'll spend the whole time wondering why this woman is so stupid."
" Great spooky movie
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,7,"Great plot, lots of good scares and great storyline. Excellent choice for scary movie night!"
" Started very well..
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,6,"I was really enjoying this, right up until they decided to show daft demons with pointy teeth.Up until then, the tension has been really well managed and built, but they destroyed it by trying to go for cheap scares.Have to say the lead actress was excellent, thoroughly convincing.Had it not been for the cheap scares, this would have got an 8."
" Last Shift - one letter from accuracy
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,2,"The premise is just painful. The daughter of a murdered cop is left by herself, on her very first night of duty, to guard the old police station that is being abandoned by the force for their new digs. What is later revealed is that the reason they built a new station is because the old station is haunted by serial killers who committed suicide in the cells. The haunting became so bad that the upper brass petitioned and fought for the new station. But that doesn't keep them from leaving an inexperienced rookie alone to guard the place on its last night. When the hauntings begin terrifying her and she reaches out to her lieutenant for help, rather than help or support her, he threatens to fire her - for the same fears that drove the entire force to another location. Oh, and those serial killers haunting the place, yeah, they killed rookie's dad.Those are the stronger plot points. Past that, it's nothing but the same trope over and over and over and over again. Something crazy happens. She goes to investigate and it gets awful... never learning her lesson, until a tragic ending.There are many great horror films you should take the time to enjoy. This is not one of them."
" It'd be so much better as a psx video game
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,4,"The director (also writer), does a great job showing us creative horror imagery, but fails miserably at telling a story. the whole movie feels like a 90s playstation game, throwing creepy level at you without a clear, straightforward tale.
the worst you can do is copy silent hill and put the protagonist in a situation where she has to escape. that'd at least give her a passive motive to move the story along. so we, the audience (not game players, experiencing first hand) don't have to wait around for the next ""area""... because everything in between is excruciatingly boring."
" I've watched a lot of horrors...
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,9,"But this one made me jump the most!! It's eerie, it's frightening & the story is good too. A friend recommended this movie to me & I watched it with no expectations, now I'm frightened to even sleep with the light off tonight. A very well done movie, it's intense from start to finish. The only reason I didn't give this movie ten stars is because I'm now so stressed lol."
" Creepy and better than average
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,6,"A genuinely scary and well-made horror film, but it does not hold well due to it conforming to too many genre clichés. It runs out of steam by the end, but in saying that it does provide a shocking conclusion. A good lead performance drives the film along, but therein lies many a face-palm moment where the actions of the main character make little sense (she is frustratingly too calm about all of this and not at all fazed by what is happening at times). Other than that there is some great scares, superb tension and some horrible and terrifying scenes. There is some superb camera-work at the very end during one sequence. A better than average horror that would have benefited from some stronger writing."
" Utter rubbish
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,1,"What a load of incoherent old toot, a waste of an hour and a half of my life, and waste of basically a very promising scenario. The film has so many horror cliches it actually became funny, all it lacked was vampires and a ghost going ""Wooooo""."
" Metaphysical police ghosts
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,7,"This is a genuinely good ghost story. A rookie police officer left to babysit an empty building gets a bit more than she bargained for when the building transforms into a metaphysical portal to hell.Haunted, in every sense of the word, by the ghost of her cop father who died in the line of duty while rescuing hostages from a bizarre satanic cult, officer Loren struggles to differentiate reality from the apparent paranormal activity plaguing her first night on the job.What begins as a series of innocuous weird but harmless events escalates in increasingly intense violence. The building slowly but surely envelopes Loren in a hellish nightmare.Last Shift is an entertaining ride that's full of creepy jump scare fun."
" A few scares but unremarkable
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,5,"A female rookie does a night shift at a now defunct police station, she is alone in the building, but is she?
This did start off quite well, it did engage me. The scares start off subtle at first but over the course of the movie the horror becomes increasingly graphic, which is where it starts to fall apart. Genuinely creepy at times, unoriginal and cliched at others. Juliana Harkavy plays the cop Jessica Loren, she is in practically every minute of the film and does a decent job. But like so many modern horror movies the end was a let down, for me this is a watch it once and forget about it by tomorrow film."
" Great idea. Poor execution
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,5,"A rookie cop spends her first night on duty as the sole officer at a police station that has just permanently closed. As her shift gets underway she starts to see and hear things that make her think she's not alone. Her belief that 'old hands' are playing a prank soon gives way to suspicion that the building may be haunted.Good atmospheric setting, good story, good central performance from Juliana Harkavy, but it doesn't quite work. Individual elements that with someone like James Wan could have been fantastically creepy, somehow fail. With figures passing behind objects, yet failing to emerge from the other side, objects repositioning themselves with impossible speed, there are obvious influences from The Conjuring and Poltergeist (to name just two). There's also heavy inspiration from John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13. Sadly, it's a pale imitation of all of these. It does get better in the last 15 or so minutes, but not enough to save it. 5/10"
" A Creepy, Good and Saddening little Movie
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,10,"I enjoyed this movie a lot and it caught me of guard, because I was expecting nothing. The acting is great and Juliana Harkavy carries the movie excellently. The Film Deserves a much better rating and it is definitely a movie I will keep in my collection. I give it a 10/10 just because I can."
" Not bad but I'd have liked a more definitive denouement...
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,6,"...in a very minor way it mirrors an experience I had myself. We have lots of jump scares and a little bit of exposition. I like the idea that the ghost of the dead cop killed in the raid returns to try to save the heroine, his sense of duty extending far beyond the grave. Perhaps the hooker she encounters at the back of the police station is actually one of the surviving girls they rescued or indeed the spirit of one of those who was killed, returning to find some justice for her death? No sequel? I like to think that the heroine survived her gunshot wound, talked her way out of the insane asylum (""Yeah I was driven temporarily insane by being left all night alone in the station where the people who murdered my father committed suicide but I'm all better now, I just want to move away and start fresh"") and went back to burn the cursed precinct to the ground, defeating the evil once and for all."
" EVIL DONE RIGHT!!!!
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,10,"If you don't care to read my rant & my opinions on what makes something scary n just want to know if you should watch this... I honestly haven't seen a scarier movie since Event Horizon. If you're a fan of PRACTICAL effects, & isolation (or one location) horror? This is a MUST WATCH!!! Keep in mind however, it's violence is BRUTAL!!
Okay... to start, I am a MASSIVE horror fan, I go through month long periods of watching at least one per day. This means I've seen basically every classic, many, many great films, & far too many very bad ones. This one is easily in my top 10 of scariest. If that's all you need to know, cool! But below I'll explain WHY.Different things scare people. Some are afraid of SLASHERS (serial killers), some of GHOSTS, some of ALIENS, some of DEMONS, etc etc. None of these, & not much at all can really get under my skin. I've seen it all, if you want to scare me? You are gonna have to come with some top notch PRACTICAL effects, bizarre concepts, unsettle me w/ things that are foreign to our understanding of what ""should be""... meaning, blood does nothing for me... a crazy killers does nothing for me... so what does??Things that are bizarre, unnatural, or simply SHOULDN'T exist/be! You can see an example of the ""shouldn't be"" w/ a monster moves in a way things don't move, such as jittery, or the joints/legs improperly located, yet somehow function ...movies that have these things on display include, THE THING, THE VOID, SILENT HILL & others.What's nuts is LAST SHIFT didn't use those ""weird"" tactics... it somehow was able to use concepts such as, SERIAL KILLERS, GHOSTS, DEMONS, & isolation...things I typically don't even both with anymore...So how can this do what the others using its tactics can't? The camera shots, the close up moments that aren't simple jump scares, but force you to take in the moment, the story itself, the acting, & above all else... THE PRACTICAL EFFECTS!!! The makeup in this film is just out of this world!!! The evil entities are just straight up BRUTAL & NASTY looking! I LOVED IT!!! The film doesn't care to try & explain why evil is evil, it also doesn't tuck you warmly into bed with a Hollywood ending. I know 2 people who asked me to shut it off, ONLY due to them being too freaked out & worried about nightmares!!!The actress as well did an incredible job at selling it all...I don't know how she's not more well known, as all I remember her being in was THE WALKING DEAD...(she's one of the two women in S3 that the Governor runs into, & I believe gets killed during the final fight at the prison) not ONLY is she awesome, but she is an ABSOLUTE STUNNER!!! Gorgeous isnt strong enough to describe her beauty!Typically, if you're a horror fan... you're well aware that on IMDB, even the BEST horrors don't often get above a 6.5, so I for the most part will give anything that sounds good a watch if it's at least above a 4.0. This being 5.1 is...respectable, however I believe it deserves to be AT LEAST at a 6.5!!! I give it a 10/10...I'm rating it as a HORROR film, not just as an overall film. Because we all know horror is like comedy... it's given small budgets, limited releases (usually), the stories are always far fetched... &
So they never really get the respect they deserve."
" Pretty damn good.
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,8,I have to say this is one of the best horror movies of this decade for me. It's very simple but it does everything very well and delivers an excellent atmosphere all throughout. If you're looking for a downright scary horror experience then this is a must watch.
" Horrible!!!
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,1,Horrible movie. With no real ending. I fill sorry for losing my time on this movie.
" Pleasant surprise
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,8,This one is a seat edge. I want to see more from that director. Creepy as fxxx. Loved it
" Genuinely creepy well made horrot
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,9,"I like me a Horror movie. I will watch some quite awful films sometimes. As a horror fan its part of the course. Last shift is a treat of a horror film. One location and truly amazing lead actress. Loren or Juliana is superb and plays the part of the tormented rookie to a tee.
She is a unique leading lady of horror.
The suspense is built masterfully and the plot directed perfectly. Whilst I willed the beautiful Loren to just leave the police station and exit the horror show, it would have been counter productive to the impending horror.
There are some good jump scares and grotesque imagery and manifestations.
All in all last shift is a great suspenseful and foreboding movie. Give it ago. You won't be disappointed."
" Mehhhhhhhhhhhh
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,4,"Maybe if the budget was higher it could have been a good film. The story was there, the main actress could definitely act, it was just lacking massively from the budget. The so called jump scared just weren't scary at all. I could be generous and give it a 5 but guess what I'm not generous."
" Hidden gem!
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,8,"Not very often I find a horror movie worth shouting about, but this is something to tell all about.
Amazong suspended and perfectly shot! Please don't hesitate to watch and have a pillow ready for the roller coaster ride of suspense."
" Been there, don't that.
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,6,"I feel like I actually have seen too many horror movies at this point. This one isn't particularly bad, it is quite good but has a lot of unused potential. It has a good main actor, good camera, good soundscape. One rarely get all of this in one movie!What ruined it for me, at least so much that I can't fully recommend to watch it, was the way the story is forced into the movie. The creepy and often scary parts which this movie clearly offers and plays out well, are interrupted with a storyline, that itself is interesting and useful for the movie, but at the same time very simple and could have been explained in other ways. I don't think the story has to be explained by in-movie movies and conversations with random appearing characters. It feels like the movie builds up tense and shivers, there's strange creepy happenings when suddenly someone or something has to explain bits of the story. That's not scary, it ruins nearly every moment.The movie could have been better if the story was maybe teased in the beginning and unfolded at the end instead of the given interruptions.Also I don't get some of the characters introduced. Some comments on here spoil those and yes, some characters seem useless to me. At some point in the movie I wished the main character was left alone for just some time instead of throwing new characters at her every minute. The most thrills I got was when she was playing solo on screen, creating that certain horror vibe I actually like a lot.Still, this is a movie one can easily recommend to horror movie fans (hence the 6*) though it still uses plain old jump scares and ruins some really creepy moments to expose the (not so complex) story. If you haven't seen many horror movies, this one has several good scenes to frighten up your night!"
" 7 or 8
",2020-10-21 00:00:00,8,"Not sure what to give it. Because of it's genre, I'd give it a 7, but, taking into consideration of it's genre, or within that particular genre, more like an 8. There is never a dull moment. That's what I liked about it. It didn't drag at all.
And Juliana Harkavy is one attractive looking woman, and a good actress."
" Last choice
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,1,"I can't believe this is currently rated a 5.8, While it had a few creepy scenes, the dumb sensless choices made by the lead actress ruined it for me. She was so annoying and stupid."
" Jump-scares abused
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,7,A good low budget movie with decent acting. the ending made sense to me as the senior officer turned out to be dead too but it was a bit anticlimatic. the main character's acting skills made it a whole lot more watchable. all in all a good one for horror lovers.
" Similar to hereditary
",2020-10-03 00:00:00,9,"Just watched Hereditary, this movie has the same Demonology, both good movies. This was scarier."
" I watched this two years ago...
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,9,"...and I came back to review it because I've never forgotten it. I'm not really sure what all the low ratings are about, unless they were determined to pick the movie apart. And let's be honest, that's no fun. If you go into this movie expecting a fun time and to be really, truly scared by several scenes, it will deliver. After I watched it the first time, I actually said I'd never watch it again because it was that scary. And I've most horror movies."
" Well made and scary low budget horror
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,8,"If Assault on Precinct 13 were a horror movie about about a lone officer in a station where a Manson Family style cult committed suicide then this is what you'd get.
It was simple and low budget but it delivered some solid scares and kept you guessing. Genuinely chilling.
Just watched this again and it still gave me goosebump. This low budget horror really gives a lot of bang for its buck."
" Does not stick with you.
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,4,"I watched this movie twice. Why? Because I completely forgot that I have already seen it. I cannot tell you what is going on. The acting is good, the setting is creepy and relatable, it has good scares and a good premise. Yet it does not work. When stuff starts to go down, you get really excited and then my brain just shut off. It took me 40 minutes to realize that I've seen this movie before, which is so weird- how did I forget about this, this is good, I thought for a brief moment...
No, no it's not."
" Spoopy.
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,8,I went into this not expecting much and holy moly it's creepy. Just watch it.
" Better than most high budget horror
",2020-08-11 00:00:00,9,"This movie is extremely under appreciated and more than worth a watch of two. Super creepy, the main actress is phenomenal, and the story isn't half bad either."
" Not Bad, Not Bad at all
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,7,"I admit I'm a fan of low budget horror films. This film manages to create a chilling atmosphere, give some nice jump scares, and some nice twists. Juliana Harkavy gives a terrific performance and the direction and editing is pretty tight. It also had some originality, often lacking in the horror scene. I would much rather watch this than yet another found footage rehash.If you're a horror fan,give it a shot."
" Strange Scenario, Some Suspense Inbetween
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,6,"I thought it would be a strange behavior to put a greenhorn cop into the last shift of a police station. I would have thought, that theese honors would have been upt to the old cops, which did their job in there for the last years. But then tried to ignore that fact.It is strange what happens then. Some of the moments in this movie were like ""ok, that can happen"". But then there were unreal moments inbetween, that really shocked me. The more the movie moves foreward, the more clear some incidents become. That's what made me hold the line.At the end, I have to admit that I was shocked at some point, but it was not really new. Scenarios like these are a dozend for sure. I would recommend it for horror newbies. The many jump scares could have changed against more suspenseful scenes."
" A low budget horror film that is a blast !
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,7,"This film is very entertaining considering it's unique plot line and low budget !
The main character officer Jessica Loren is brilliantly portrayed by Juliana Harkavy (who I believe won an award for her performance in 2016) she never breaks character and is continuously impressive in the main characters role!
The film centres mostly around the case of mason family wannabes haunting Jessica because of her past of her father being a cop and unfortunately being killed by them, this allows the watcher to delve more so into the theme of mental health and how she is effected by her past unable deter what's in her head and what's reality.
This easily puts us on Jessica's side and makes the ending shocking !"
" Don't waste your time with this!!
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,1,"Total disaster! The movie was a shot in the oven. Literally. The policewoman went back and forth all the time because she heard something, but unfortunately nothing great happened. There wasn't a single moment of horror. The movie was a sleeping pill! 1/10 *"
" To fans of horror: this one surpasses expectations and is surprisingly effective
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,8,"Everything about this film on paper screams straight-to-DVD s**tfest. As someone who is a fan of horror and very critical of them, I can say 'Last Shift' is better than it has any right to be. This supernatural horror is not just a solid effort from an unknown cast and crew - it's impressive.When rookie cop Jessica Loren is assigned the last shift at a transitioning police station, she's tasked with waiting for a hazmat crew to come and collect evidence. But her first shift will become her worst, as a series of paranormal occurrences force her to confront a lingering evil.Perhaps most importantly, the direction is excellent. Anthony DiBlasi shows a real grasp on atmosphere, with eerie whispers, gruesome hallucinations, and poltergeist activity each achieving the desired effect. Through these psychological scares it fleshes out a story that is appropriately dark, sinister and subversive, adding to the atmosphere. And even though it gets into a noticeable rhythm, the scares remain fresh and creative, and the tension is slow and sustained, which is rarely seen these days.'Last Shift' is a horror that deserved a place on the big screen instead of being relegated to streaming platforms. It's superior to most modern entries in the genre, is well filmed from beginning to end, and contains many creepy surprises.7.5/10"
" it has its moments
",2020-03-29 00:00:00,7,"Slowly this flick moves between a ghostly story and pure imagination, it's up to you to decide which way it goes. Sometimes I liked the flick and sometimes it was a bit too much of the same or a bit too slow.What i did like is that there's nothing I can see was done CGI, so on part of the effects they were done on-camera. This flick is a pure jumpscene horror and not that much is explained.Well done flick as I see it on the point of effects, acting was okay.Gore 1/5
Nudity 0/5
Effects 3/5
Story 2/5
Comedy 0/5"
" I love how people give such crappy movies high ratings. It makes no sense
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,1,"There is no campy appeal, well the storyline could have been a good idea, the execution made it so that it was just downright trash and the acting was on par with a Sci-Fi original film, as well as the special effects. There's nothing inherently scary, interesting or even good about this movie.I do not understand why anybody would ever give this over one star. I could even make it through 30 minutes of it because it was so bad.A rookie cop, alone in a decrepit, broke down about to be demolished police station with ghosts of the Manson family chasing after her, need I say more? It's boring, drawn out and just downright stupid. Don't waste your money or your time."
" Solid Horror with a solid script
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,7,First horror film I have seen in a while that it looks like someone actually wrote a script for.
" Huge potential but ...
",2020-01-19 00:00:00,1,"The movie doesn't make any sense. The officer witnessed a lot of weird supernatural things, and act as it was normal. Very stupid. The movie doesn't make any sense. She basically ignored everything happened on the station and follow working. Crap movie."
" Laughable and a total cliche
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,3,"Started well and the main character is kinda good, but for me it went way off the rails when the exaggerated bloody characters (not really well done by the way) appeared... it got totally unbelievable.Not my kind of horror, I think this film is tacky and a total boring cliche.If you like seeing the usual bloody/disgusting entities and are willing to ignore the weakness of the story and lack of creativity, maybe this film is for you."
" Great movie here!
",2019-11-17 00:00:00,10,"Horror is the only genre I watch, well almost, and I have seen a lot, but let me tell you, the last time I felt chills was watching The Others, and then I saw Grave Encounters, and Last Shift.
Now I'm not scared easily, but this one made me watch it again just to feel what I felt the first time.And guess what, even with all the spoilers, it was still scary. Now that s what I call a great horror movie!"
" Good lead actress stuck in a low budget bore
",2019-10-01 00:00:00,5,"A rookie cop spends her first shift at a police station that is closing due to scaaaaary reasons. And of course scaaaaary things start to happen. That's about it. This is a low budget movie that gets by on its creepy atmosphere and a convincing performance by the lead actress. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but the last 20 minutes or so are a total mess, right up to the very blah ending."
" Not good
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,4,I don't know why if felt like residents evil. Don't watch it by the way
" Waste of time
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,2,"Nothing special all of its scares and tricks you have already seen in every other horror movie, This whole movie is a horror movie cliche, had to turn it off terrible movie do not waste your time"
" Solid horror movie
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,8,Is definitely a creepy movie with the right jump scares
" Creepy but lacking
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,6,"Mannn, I really wanted to fw this movie, it had a lot going for it. Fresh concept, good acting, creepy atmosphere, original scares, minimal jump scares. But the story execution felt kinda lacking fam, can't lie. It takes waaaayyyy too long for the protagonist to clock the frigging station's haunted and to just leave, nothing long. Kinda seems like after a while you don't know what's really real and when you get to the end you still don't know which is frustratingI guess I'd say I'd recommend it, just for the creepy imagery and that but its not like a top notch banger"
" Genuinely scary... worth the watch But def not the best
",2019-05-31 00:00:00,7,There were some seriously scary moments in this. I watch a lot of horror movies and this one genuinely creeped me out. Main actress was great and the premise was cool. The end was.. disappointing. The last 20 minutes weren't as good as they could've been and weren't consistently scary with the rest of the movie. Kind of predictable. What pissed me off the most was.. she wasn't actually trapped until the end and had SO MANY OPPURTUNITIES/VIABLE REASONS to LEAVE or call the police and ask for back up. No rational human would voluntarily stay in there unless .. you know.. they were in a poorly thought out horror movie. But again I will say the scares were wicked good and creepy as hell. Conclusion: A frustrating hypothetical situation to watch but definitely worth it for the scares!
" Briliant isolated horror ...
",2019-05-30 00:00:00,9,"Jessica Loren (Juliana Harkavy) is working the last shift at a closing police station, alone, with only a fairly unhelpful police aid on the end of a phone as support. Harkavy is excellent, carrying much of the film through every creepy moment, remaining stoical and diligent at all times as events become ever more fraught. As a viewer, you are with her all the way in a way that is rare in films of this type. And then there's Monica, who keeps calling, and Monica's predicament may be even more unnerving that Loren's ...The building is another effective 'character': old and tattered, with peeling paint and unhygienic kitchen and rest areas. Not quite a typical haunted house, but a clinical and unwelcoming place by its very nature, and hardly reassuring to poor Loren or the viewer.Tight and focussed direction from Anthony DiBlasi (who also co-wrote) keeps the frights coming relentlessly, and the results are loaded with the kind of unforgiving thrills and jump-scares that are genuinely frightening, and that big budgeted Hollywood blockbusters would give their Halloween masks for. My score for this excellent frightener is 9 out of 10."
" Such a frustrating film
",2019-05-28 00:00:00,1,"Some genuinely creepy moments but also a lot of stupid and illogical character and plot moments that kept taking me out of the film It was a bad movie. The idea of it is pretty cool but the way it was directed made it lame. They should have done reshoots to fix some of the issues. Maybe it would have been better with a different director? It's full of clichés too. Wish the movie was as scary as the poster makes it seem. i am wondering who give this movie 6 or higher truly what a shame. this movie was terrible. the main character's behavior was unrealistic, crappy writing."
" Great low budget horror
",2019-04-22 00:00:00,8,"This film has a very high ""creepy"" vibe going on. I've never experienced a general fright from any horror movie but, there are a few that tend to get under my skin and linger after watching. this is one of them low budget made extremely well. Great acting from the lead actress. special effects and makeup were perfect for the budget. this film proves you dont need millions of dollars to make an above average horror film."
" Not even a strong performance can save a ridiculous premise
",2019-03-27 00:00:00,5,"Okay...think about it:A rookie cop is being tasked with guarding a full-size, entirely empty precinct...where the people who murdered her father only a year prior and who hanged themselves in the very same cells...completely alone...overnight...on her very first day?Really??Still not ludicrous enough for you? How about nobody checking on her when 1) she keeps reporting impossible phone calls and 2) she actually tells her superior that she's *seeing things*? Again...on her very first night.Usually, when a movie disappoints me it is because the plot does not live up to an interesting premise; this one didn't work because the premise in and of itself was so spectacularly stupid that it's impossible to suspend that much disbelief. Worse, it is completely without any self-awareness and absolutely devoid of humor. If you want to ask your viewer to accept the impossible, the least you can do is offer a nudge-nudge here and there so they can be in on the joke.And it wouldn't even be hard to fix-have her on the job a few months and her partner calls in sick, maybe. Allow ten years to pass since her father's murder instead of one. Giventhe main Big Bad a few darkly funny lines. Something. Anything would help.Such a shame, really-there are some legit scares to be found and Juliana Harkavy delivers a strong performance, but freaking Meryl Streep could not make up for such a paper-thin plot. Hopefully, future casting directors can judge Harkavy's talent outside the context of this almost insultingly stupid script."
" Acting good, plot and direction not so much.
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,2,"To put it briefly, this is like Room 1408 buy in a haunted police station.Just a lot worse written. Have the character just going from room to room, repesting some of the scares, many calls. With the character only trying to leave twice, one she leaves but goes back to answer the phone. Why? You're out, and you know stuff is happening but I guess listening to the same girl saying the same stuff over and over is important?Second time she leaves that door wont open. so instead of shooting at the glass she goes back inside for more spooky exposition and same trio making faces and singing.
Not even bothering to try the back door.So we have the spooky trio ghosts that are evil. But why is the police ghost also evil????On room 1408 the character does whatever he thinks to try get out of the room.Here in a whole police station she just goes from room to room to show more jumpscares.As a short I could have seen this working. Novice cop alone at haunted police station is tortured by cultists ghosts making her go insane. the end.There's no arch no nothing. Nothing matters. Why should I care and cheer for a character that doesn't show any interest or motivation to survive and just serves as a scream girl to be lured from room to room for the next scare.Giving 2 stars for the main actress, even with what she had she did a good job. The rest, dissapointment."

I must admit,I've seen many horror movie and it doesn't make me scared or shocked.
But yes,This movie is the first one to do so.The jumpscare,The horror atmosphere,Everything is in a good place.Just watch it by yourself and you'll understand it.

" One of the better horror movies I've seen in years
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,10,"I saw this movie a couple years ago and it always amazes me. With a low budget they managed to scare the witts out of you with subtle unexpected jump scares, a creepy tune you'll hate yourself for huming later and creepy visuals. Not to mention the acting is wonderful for a lower budget film. I never get scared from movies often, but this one was a very nice change of pace from mainstream horror movie tropes."
" Can be good film but this's suck
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,2,The acting is really terrible and lot of terrible shooting scene but story line of the film quite not bad.
" Caught me by surprise !!!!!
",2018-10-29 00:00:00,8,"Figured it to be cheap and cheesy, but it's really good, acting is great story was mildly subpar but for the budget it's good. Love the jump scares."
" True Horror right here
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,9,"Scary, mysterious and it will make you think about what's real and what isn't, a really nice horror movie, , only negative thing to say about it is the ending, wasn't expecting it to end like that, felt kind of short."
" Watch it. It's a decent movie.
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,7,"This movie is actually pretty entertaining. Give it a try. It is a B-movie, yes. But the scares are very effective. I would say it is one of the more scarier movies that I have seen in a while. Also, the writing is pretty creative. I dare say you wont get disappointed."
" Scared Me
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,8,There is some legitimately good scares in this movie. I enjoyed it.
" Worth watching
",2018-10-08 00:00:00,7,"If you can ignore some of the acting, and low budget effects, Then you can really get into it. Horror movies with bigger budgets can't do what this movie does and that's keep the suspense almost trough the whole film."
" It's looks original at first but it's another generic horror
",2018-10-06 00:00:00,3,"I struggle to really enjoy a movie with a cop as a protagonist but with this movie I tried because it's not a simply Law and Order Narrative.I liked how it hit the ground running. It went straight to the point, no need for filler like in The Conjuring or something.It's not a bad premise and at one point I was really affected by the situation where you don't want to though the towel in on situation out of fear of being branded a quitter.But the whole thing develops poorly. It's generic Satanists-are-evil stuff. They don't call themselves Satanists but its basically the same thing aesthetically.The bulk of the movie are uncanny little camera tricks that remind me of those silent movies where would play around with what the camera could do rather than focus story. The effect is more laughable than anything,"
" A really creepy movie to watch with friends.
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,6,This movie certainly isn't amazing but if your bored with some friends and you wanna watch a scary movie this is a good one to watch. It's scary and keeps you on edge the whole movie. The plot isn't very good and the story telling isn't amazing but for a small budget horror film the movie is fairly good.
" One of the best movies on Netflix...Period
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,9,"Might be the best horror movie on Netflix. This really is a hidden gem that needs more exposure. A quality horror movie that exceeds expectations. Its an interesting story that keeps you guessing, terrified and satisfied because unlike other horror movies it actually has an ending. Stop searching reviews and watch this now. You will get scared and you wont be disappointed. Youre welcome, enjoy."
" Nightmare at the police station
",2018-09-13 00:00:00,4,"Was really intrigued by the premise of 'Last Shift'. The poster/cover and advertising also looked quite creepy. Was encouraged a little by the average rating and divisive reviews, considering my recent viewings of low-budget films which tended to be poorly received on both counts. So it wasn't as if 'Last Shift' didn't have anything going for it. It actually did have a sizeable degree of potential. 'Last Shift' didn't really live up to much of its potential, turning out to be a film that was nowhere near as good as its premise. It is not unwatchable, it has its good things, and there are certainly far worse films, not just overall but of its genre. It is sadly a case of losing steam far too early after a promising start, with a good first third, and playing it too safe, not enough new ideas or risks and it gets silly and at points dull.There are good things. Was pleasantly surprised by how good the production values were, the film is very well shot, eerily lit and makes the most of the simple but atmospheric locations. The editing is cohesive at least as well. The sound is not overbearing or obvious, not making the scares too foreseeable.Juliana Harkovy is a credible lead and as said the first third is good. It is creepy and suspenseful, with not too much of an over-reliance on jump-scares and did find myself biting my nails and jumping a little at times. Unfortunately, the rest of the acting is pretty non-descript and the character writing is yet another case of having bland characters and also being frustrating in how they behave, a bugbear of mine is hasty and less than logical decision making and there is a lot of that in 'Last Shift'. The script never feels natural or flows and it is very difficult to take it seriously. The direction is uneven, assured in the first third but somewhat leaden towards the end. Momentum is lost and some of the film gets tedious. Furthermore, the tension, creepiness and suspense goes and is replaced by a lot of face-palming, predictability, tedium and silliness. The final act is a mess of incoherence and intelligence-insulting dumbness and then culminates with an ending that doesn't feel like one at all and reeks of the writers not knowing how to end the film and taking the easy way out.Overall, lacklustre but not a waste of time. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
" Truly enjoyable and creepy supernatural effort
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,9,"Arriving at a run-down police station, a rookie officer covering the night shift at the station is continually confronted by a series of supernatural antics about a demonic cult haunting the premises and sets out to stop the spirits from staying there only to be dragged into a darker situation.Overall this was a rather enjoyable effort. One of the best aspects featured here is the slow-burn build-up of the storyline here which is rather creepy and chilling. The idea of being alone in the police alone, crumbling and about to be torn down as it is, provides this was a stellar setting for what transpires throughout here as things rapidly spiral out of control. Not only is the initial setup shown taking place in a decrepit, run-down location full of faulty lighting, crumbling stained walls and just leftover debris from their collections that serve as the perfect type of backdrop for the later insanity to follow up on. The general buildup of that insanity is handled masterfully, going from the small shock type of scares to far deeper and grandiose pieces. From the homeless man who interacts with her alone in the building to the rearranging of furniture and the visit from the spectral officer which is revealed through a spectacular gag, the small scenes are a great counter to the larger freak-out sequences that build-up a fantastically chilling atmosphere throughout here. Ranging from hooded figures in front of a mirror not following with their reflections to distorted figures appearing and chasing her to a stellar sequence featuring the cult members projecting themselves onto a screen and interacting with the objects in the room, it creates the fun tactic of creepy actions happening in a creepy location that always works well. That leads into the finale where it has a lot of tense, creepy fun when it really lets loose. With the storyline giving off the truth about the various torments and tactics against her, this allows for a pretty lively and energetic segment where it puts on some really creepy ideas involving the cult figures bringing up some fun work with the deformed ghost chasing her around the station, the various ghosts popping up for a series of brutal quick gunfights that provide this with the perfect twist here which turns a seemingly supernatural-leaning effort into a more realistic type of story which adds a lot to the creepy imagery. Alongside the fine gore and the demonic makeup, these hold it up over it's few minor flaws. About the only real issue with the film is that it seems to have a feeling that she's never in any real danger. The various actions that are played out here, from the interaction of the cult members to the phone calls and all the flashing demonic figures seen throughout the building, are not in the slightest bit threatening to her and opt for more of a mental torture and psychological breakdown which is expertly accomplished yet never means their plan makes sense. It's more just a series of flashes and then they disappear, really coming off rather like they're toying with her instead of putting her in danger which lowers this somewhat. As well as a few flimsy effects pieces at times, these are all that hold this down.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and Nudity."
" Go with recommendations from people with similar taste, not numerical score averages
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,7,"This is one of those movies where I see a 5.7 average and think ""this is why it's better to go by user reviews from people that share your taste, rather then numerical score). This movie is really good. Actually it's the best horror movie I've seen this year, and I've been on a horror movie kick for the last few weeks."
" My first review
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,8,"I love watching horror and suspense movies. I've even branched out to some foreign horror films because it's hard to find good horror films that won't leave me rolling my eyes the whole time I'm watching it. Blood and gore doesn't scare me - psychological horror does. I think it's because that seems more likely a possibility to actually happen in real life than ghosts and made up creature scenarios.I had seen this movie pop up a lot when I would do a search for horror films on Netflix but I always bypassed it thinking it was pry just another stupid eye rolling film. I can't believe how much I didn't NOT like it.I've never seen the main character before but she is very striking and I think she did a very good job carrying the movie by herself for the most part for not being that well known. That's usually something a well known established actor can/will do so I'm curious to know how the directors came to find her and know she'd be capable of carrying the film on her own. I'm married to a cop and I thought her actions and responses really mirrored what an actual cop would do in similar circumstances. It wasn't just a pretty bimbo actress trying to be a cop. It almost seemed like she did ride alongs with real cops to prepare for this film.This movie really held my interest and I was on the edge of my seat waiting to find out what would happen. I really liked the parts where the lead would see something then turn back and things would be changed. The film
did a good job of portraying how the mind works and how it can play tricks on you.I didn't like the cop in the beginning. I guess he acted weird because of the effect of the station on him BUT when you don't have that knowledge yet when you first start the movie it just seems plain over the top. If I had been that girl I would have left right away and called someone about that whack job.I didn't like that they threw the homeless guy in for filler and I'm bothered that we don't find out the deal with that photograph she finds in one of the lockers showing a little girl on a man's shoulders. Who are those people and how do they relate to the film. I kept expecting them to circle back and tie it in but in the end I was kept hanging.I thought the woman who was outside the station smoking did a good job with her short screen time. She could have played that part way over the top to ill affect but she managed to make her role believable.I guess the part that really stuck with me the most is the one where the cop stops by to check on her. When he came onscreen I was thinking ""oh ok he will leave and she'll call the other station and reference him and no one will have ever heard of him"" or something along those lines but when he turned around and walked away and you could see the back of his head it was kind of chilling. I wasn't expecting that.The ending was ok. You spend so much time becoming invested in this rookie and then it ends and you're like ""Really?! That's it?!"" But I have to say it was a much better ending than a lot of horror films. At any rate in spite of that I would recommend this film."
" Best horror movie
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,10,Sooooo freaking great. Vv scary and very unexpected things happen. Well thought out and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it
" Creepy, Above Average Horror Film
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,7,"Last Shift was a decent horror film, albeit littered with horror clichés and brought down by an abhorrent, semi-confusing ending. Worth watching for the great one-woman performance by Juliana Harkavy and the various long-take scenes. And some really good scares."
" Messes with your head!
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,9,"This is one of my favorite horror movies of all time. I almost feel like this movie is my little secret that I get to share with the few others who have seen it because it truly is a hidden gem. Genuinely creepy without relying on jump scares, a very unique and well-done plot, a fulfilling ending, and not to mention the compelling scares, are what make this movie amazing. This movie is just another example of a low budget non-Hollywood movie that outshines all the other Hollywood jump scare (playing loud music as a friend taps the character on the shoulder out of nowhere) nonsense. The only problem I have with this movie is that it barely goes over the top and gets slightly far-fetched at times; I wish it would have stayed a little more grounded and not get too carried away at some points. This is why I cannot give this movie a 10, but I have seen so many horror movies and this is one of my favorites and I would highly recommend this to people as long as they have an open mind."
" Not Bad
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,9,I am a horror fan. I love all things horror especially when it comes to horror movies. This was a good film in my opinion and I haven't heard of it until I watched it with my friend and we really liked it. It is a creepy movie and it's a good movie too. I mean it does have it's annoying ghost movie plot sequences but i do like this movie.
" A very very very good horror
",2018-06-19 00:00:00,9,"If you are used to being constantly let down by insipid, uninspired, or derivative horrors (or simply by bland horrors rated highly by ""critics"") then you need to see this. I am a fan of very good horror and my fave films include the Descent, Neon Demon and the autopsy of Jane Doe. This film features a female cop (with lips to die for, lols) who has to do a last shift at the cop shop where he father served, only for this to occur on the anniversary of a mass suicide of many satanists at the station a year before. the film contains many jump scares but is still very original and includes some of the best moments (done very well) that I have ever seen done in horror. Watch out for the moment where the ""concerned cop"" comes to check in on her - thats one of the moments I mean. Gripping, tense, and very well-paced. This is a great horror film and Im really not sure why it isnt rated higher than it is."
" Go watch it for the amazingly well done jump scares
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,7,"This is an underrated horror thriller which gets most things right- the pacing, jump scare and even acting is pretty decent which is a shock since no one has really heard of this film. DiBlasi is a talent to watch out for judging by the way he gets everything right with a limited budget. Last shift is a great film. (Go watch it for the amazingly well done jump scares)"
" Surprisingly scary, watch this!!
",2018-05-19 00:00:00,8,"I was genuinely delighted about this movie. A really talented cast, interesting story and believable effects. Very few movies nowadays actually scare me so I was happy to feel the creeping terror. The ending was awesome too and was like an icing on a cake. The only thing that I didn't enjoy was the overwhelming exposition. To be fair, I don't know what would have worked better, but the phone calls, floating pictures and what not were kind of irritating. Anyway, enjoyed this over all and that's why 8/10."

" I am safe in the arms of our master
",2018-02-16 00:00:00,9,"Jessica ""Cuddle Bug"" Loren (Juliana Harkavy) is a rookie cop on her first shift. She is standing guard over an abandoned police building awaiting Bio Joe (Jason Fusco) to pick up the remaining evidence that is also hazmat material. There are odd things going on within the building that appear to be more than just ""settling."" Her dad was a legacy who had died a year earlier in a shoot out with the cult group ""The Paymon Family"" modeled after the Manson family.Clearly the police station is haunted as Jessica descends into seeing illusions and growing more confused as she is determined to finish her shift against all odds.I really liked this ghost/slasher haunting. Sarah Sculco had that Squeaky Fromme crazy down pat. Joshua Mikel played his own cult leader. They are not Satan worshipers. ""The devil is just another b**ch of the Lord.""Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Incredible
",2018-01-18 00:00:00,10,"Others might not think the movie is as good as i'm saying it is, but this is my opinion. The movie actually scared me, which is something that doesn't happen often with horror movies. It didn't need to be a generic slasher film in order to induce fear. It delved deep into psychological fear, which is what I like. Not many movies can successfully do what this movie did. The story itself interested me, and during every twist in the storyline, I was on the edge of my seat. Yes, there were jumpscares, but not predictable ones. Sure, here and there there would be some weird scenes, or scenes that I felt the movie didn't really need, but the fact that they made something out of nothing and actually made it good, makes me think it deserves a 10 out of 10 rating."
" Twists that don't turn
",2017-09-08 00:00:00,3,"I wanted to like this movie but between the predictable ending, the equally predictable jump scares, and the fact that the ""monsters"" were given too much screen time added up to a pretty mediocre movie. Before the half way point I managed to guess correctly that this would all be in her head(or maybe it was real, the ending made me feel that the director wasn't sure either). When it comes to scares, by the second half I could tell when the jump-scares were coming. The monsters/villains/demonic-entities often showed up well lit, the best horror movies almost universally clothe their monsters in shadows knowing it will hide any shortcomings the monster may have. The worst part of the movie personally was when the interview tapes played by themselves resulting in a torrent of cliché and the best chance to make this movie something far better. During the scene with the interviews the leader of the killer cult that now haunts the police station states that they are not devil worshipers while hinting at some force in hell that existed far before Satan took up residence, missing the chance for some good old fashioned cosmic horror, the movie never comes back to this. All in all there are worse movies to spend your time on."
" Incredibly slow paced and then it just ends once it started to get good...
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,4,"It was my love for the horror genre and the movie's cover that made me stop and pick up this movie. I didn't know anything about the movie or who were in it, nor had I ever heard about the movie prior to finding it. But I still decided to give the movie a go, because it might actually turn out to be a hidden gem.This is a incredibly slow paced movie and there is very little of any interest happening all the way up until the 50 minute marker. There was a little bit happening up to then, such as weird phone calls, strange noises, stuff moving by itself, but nothing overly interesting or particularly spooky.There were some nice and interesting enough visuals throughout the movie, although you shouldn't set your anticipation up for something groundbreaking or spectacular though.I wasn't familiar with the actress Juliana Harkavy prior to this movie, but I must say that she performed quite well in this movie, and did put on a rather convincing performance. So she definitely carried the movie quite nicely. Actually, I wasn't familiar with anyone on the cast list. And I do enjoy watching new faces and talents perform in movies, because there is no associations to previous roles.The visual and special effects in the movie were actually quite good, just a shame that they weren't used in an abundance. The effects were used in moderation, but the movie would definitely not have suffered if they had turned it up a notch and put in more effects. The gore, mutilation and mayhem effects were quite nice.Once the movie actually starts to get interesting, which was around 75 minutes into it, then it ends shortly there after. Seriously? It was so anti-climatic as it could be."
" fun for horror fans
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,8,"The film is totally underrated. The viewer will sympathize the hero since the beginning of the scary incidents and will suffer along with her during all this escalation of horror. I understand the low rating as the ""Last shift"" sometimes it gets quite brutal and actually it gives pure horror. For some people Last shift might become ""heavy"" for their stomach (or heart). The only negative is it does not present anything innovative that could add something really new."
" Surprisingly Good!!!, Highly Recommend you watch this!!!
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,8,"I actually hadn't heard of this when I settled down to watch it, But i have to say I was very pleasantly surprised!!!,It is very effectively done, Extremely well made, A simple idea but so well executed it keeps your​ attention throughout.I really liked the story behind the characters,I really can't think of anything negative to say about it, If your a big horror fan like me you will probably be sick of how many bad horrors are out there but occasionally you get a treat and this is one of those treats, Now sit back,turns the lights out and enjoy!!!"
" Loud noises aren't scary. Neither is this movie.
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,2,"This movie had a interesting premise: ""A rookie cop's 1st shift in the last night of a closing police station alone turns into a living nightmare.""Too bad the ""living nightmare"" is a headache involving loud noises and screams every few seconds along with bad jump ""scares"" which stop working the moment they showed up. In-fact the sounds are also used as jump ""scares"" before the actual jump scares show up. It's THAT bad.Creating a movie based on Manson family alone should be a bad idea. There is nothing scary about a bunch of crazy people going around shooting or killing random people. Maybe it was scary back in the day when it actually happened, but now we've seen worse acts committed in movies alone, forget in reality (ISIS).Let's talk about the actress, the protagonist who's supposed to carry the whole movie on her shoulders. The movie lasts for about 80 mins (excluding credits of course) and ONLY after 70 mins, you for the first time, will see a ""horror"" expression on her face. In those 70 mins, she looks mildly annoyed and suffering from constipation. That look refuses to change except in the last 10 minutes. I started laughing at the ""scares"" accompanied by her constipated look.In-fact, I was so bored that I actually started focusing on her uniform, how cheap it looked, her shoes which were like Nike shoes, her awful police logo.. it's all just cheap. Event the police station where this takes place looks like a small hospital which they tried to pass off as a police station (with ONE CELL). Terrible plot, terrible acting, no horror and a wasted premise on crappy Manson family. Great. Another waste of time after I sat through State of Emergency.2/10 - 2 for one thing I liked about the movie.. which I forgot while writing the review. :))"
" Fun for a low budget horror
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,6,"Pretty fun for a low budget horror. My biggest complaint is I think they really blew an opportunity. They revealed things way too quickly. It's a simple fact of horror movies; the more you show the villain, the less scary they become. When you reveal the monster (or in this case, ghost of a crazy murderous family) they lose their shock value. I kept waiting for a bigger climax but was sorely disappointed. All that said, brilliant set up, great execution using a single location, and awesome acting. It's worth a watch!"
" Creepy and Intense
",2017-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Directed by Anthony DiBlasi (Dread), Last Shift is a well-written and decent horror movie.Revolving around newcomer officer, Jessica Loren (Juliana Harkavy) who starts her first night shift in a police station that is basically abandoned but needing ""security"". She is greeted and soon left alone by her rather intense commanding offer and strange occurrences begin to unfold as the night progresses. The movie is pretty fast paced, there's a load of jumps scares and it has some pretty creepy moments. I'd recommended it."
" I respect what they were trying to do.
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,5,"When newcomer officer; Jessica Loren (Juliana Harkavy) takes her first night shift in her police station, she – along with the audience – notices an immediate that there is something wrong with her new post in the station. After her discomforting commanding officer; Sgt. Cohen (Hank Stone) leaves, strange occurrences begin to unfold as the night gradually progresses, leading to a moderately discomforting venture for both the lead and audiences alike.Harkavy is a convincing young actress who I would be happy to see get more work in the business. She carries the weight of this film on her back and we grow to genuinely fear for her safety, as we learn more and more about his backstory and her motivations as to why she seems so determined to stay and complete her shift, rather than taking the more sensible option and leave the station to safety. The supporting characters however certainly leave something to be desired. While one likable side character does appear around half way through the movie (this being Officer Price, played by Matt Doman), he does not stay for long and really only serves to add a little more depth to Loren's history. He does nothing to further the plot or in any other movie, doesn't even stay long enough to leave a lasting effect on the audience. The only reason he is as memorable as he is, is because all the other characters are bland shells that only slightly resembles humanity.Other characters include a drunk homeless man who breaks into the station, however he serves no purpose aside from being a prop for the director to cause jump scares and be a play thing for the paranormal entities – which in turn, frighten Officer Loren. Sgt. Cohan is an unnecessarily disturbing old cop who first introduces himself to with a very peculiar attempt at a jump scare. He yells at Loren when he first sees her and creates much tension in the scene that follows. His character is never expanded upon and is just presented as an unlikable, rage-filled man. I believe the intended effect is to show how this station has left a haunting effect on its residents, however it is never shown in a manner that we can relate to. She doesn't seem like a tortured soul, just like a child with anger management issues.There are a few other characters throughout the narrative, such as a prostitute, a group of young female cultists and a serial killer (played by Joshua Mikel), however none of them are particularly noteworthy. However despite the abysmal character writing, there were many other aspects of the film making that truly reaches above and beyond my expectations. The while the narrative, falls into the many typical tropes of the genre. the movie shies away from using the musical score build suspense or add sharp, loud sound effects to the jump scares and instead chooses to allow the scenes to play out how they would in reality – allowing the intensity of certain scenes to grow entirely through the eerie silences and echoing sounds that rattle through the 'empty' halls of the police station.The cinematography is also impressively done in a way, not typically seen in the Supernatural/Horror genre. There is an extended shot within the last ten minutes of the film that lasts for an exceptionally long time during an action filled shoot out in the station. This is intended to give the impression of a documentary style police raid with the camera staying consistently within a mid-shot of Harkavy's back in the left of the screen while the action is shown from a perspective likewise to her own. As a result, whenever the opposing gunmen turn to face Harkavy, they are also looking at the viewer, adding to a certain amount of audience immersion. By this point in the film, because we are rooting for Officer Loren to survive this onslaught, the fact that the film maker's made this choice shows that they have a strong awareness of which aspects of the film matters more than others. We connect to our lead in a way that allows this last few minutes to feel whole-heartedly immersed in the events. However, despite my respect for this prolonged scene, it leads to an ultimately abrupt and unsatisfying conclusion that leaves a lot to be desired. Without giving anything away, it ends in a manner that not only doesn't tie into what the narrative was leading you to believe (yet it doesn't have a plot twist), but also isn't conclusive in any particular arcs. They say that the ending can either make or break a story and here it certainly does apply. While the movie does have other problem, had it ended in a way that made a little more sense narratively, I would be a little more forgiving of these issues. However as it stands, my feelings of Last Shift are incredibly mixed. Director Anthony DiBlasi also Wrote and Edited this film and I can see he is a talented film maker, and I hope he gets more work in the action oriented side of film making, however, as a writer he has a lot to improve upon."
" This movie gave me cancer
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,3,"The ending was just so bad that it lost the whole momentum it had going on. A lot of loose ends, plot holes, and things not explained. That said it had okay jump scare scenes, great sound effects, and some neat but not unique visuals. Would never recommend it someone I give a s*it about. Since I am obligated to talk about this high school project someone attempted to call a movie for ten lines (IMDB rules), this paragraph is here just like more than half of this movie to fill up the space/time required. Let this comment be as irrelevant as ""Last Shift"" should be... Thank you for your time, it was better spent here than on this ""movie""."
" Absorbing if confusing horror
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,7,Last Shift is a decent enough supernatural horror about a rookie cop left to look after a police station on it's last night. She is plagued by visions of demons which may be linked to her past. This is a bit of a slow burner and if you've seen many supernatural films there is nothing really new here. It isn't a particularly scary film but it is strangely absorbing helped by a good performance by Juliana Harkavy who commands most of the screen time. It is often hard to follow what is real and who is who and a lot of the film is left open to personal interpretation. There aren't many loose ends tied up neatly for you here and in this case I think that makes it a better film. It's certainly one I would watch again to see if it made any more sense. Last Shift won't appeal to everyone but as far as this genre goes it's a pretty decent effort.
