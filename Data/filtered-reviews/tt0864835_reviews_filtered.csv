" Unique enough to enjoy and watch
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,6,"It may not have Oscar winning talent or the most interesting plot, but this movie does have Penny, and that's good enough for me."
" Adults trashing kids films
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,9,Parents should judge a movie based on how their children react. My daughter first watched this movie when she was 3 and she loved it. At the very least it helped develop an interest in history. Two years down the line and she's still watching it.I'm looking forward to enjoying the same experience with my youngest daughter when she's old enough.

" Smart family fun
",2021-03-09 00:00:00,9,"Mr. Peabody is the most successful and accomplished dog in human history. Using his ability to talk and a genius mind this dog is a business titan and also a scientist, ingenious inventor, gourmand, olympic medalist & and has practically every other skill imaginable. When Mr. Peabody discovers a small baby, Sherman, abandoned in an alley Peabody makes it his life goal to be the best father for Sherman he can be. While giving the small baby something Peabody never had , a place to call home. Just like everything else, Peabody is skilled in anything he puts his mind to. His crown achievement, the invention of the WABAC, or 'way back' , a time traveling orb of sorts capable of amazing things. Using this 'way back' Mr. Peabody & Sherman travel to influential times in history including King Tut's reign in Egypt, Leonardo da Vinci in Italy and Agamemnon's exploits in Greece. All going smoothly, Sherman inadvertently breaks the rules of time travel and now it's a race against time to mend the holes they created in history in order to restore the future to it's scheduled course.A very well done animated piece for kids and adults alike. This one makes history fun quite honestly and puts enough spin on the time traveling genre to make this film unique. Probably one of the funniest kids movies out there, jokes the kids understand and all the pun's for the adults to enjoy. For it being a remade classic the filmmakers did this one real justice. I also love the fact that sneakily kids actually learn something, although it's not 100% historically accurate. An amazing selection of voice actors here and they all mesh perfectly together. Full fledged smart fun for all-ages."
" Very good
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,8,"With the premise that ""If a boy can adopt a dog, why can't a dog adopt a boy ??"" The film begins with this thought and the dog, Peabody, always rejected as a puppy, resolves through studies, to become someone in life and succeeds. He ends up adopting an abandoned boy, Sherman, and so he educates him in a way that many children and even adults would like. Through a time machine, built by Peabody, he teaches by living in the moment with Sherman. But as always, this becomes a problem when rules are set for use and the weakness of all boys appears: A girl. Very creative and humorous, a great adventure for the whole family.Film seen on the 17th to the 18th of February 2021."
" Suprisingly great
",2021-02-18 00:00:00,8,"Witty, clever, fun and even better than I expected! I'd really recommend it"
" Mr. Peabody & Sherman on 4k ultra hd
",2021-01-25 00:00:00,8,"Being a mediocre fan of history, I wanted to watch this movie but the Amazon.ca price, for a 5 year old movie, was too much.Found a single copy in Canada's Shopper's Drug Mart for C$6.99! Looking forward to watching it. Now on upgrade Upscaled 4K and Dolby Vision coming soon on Universal 4k ultra hd release April 2021"
" Very entertaining
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,9,It's a great film that is worth your time. It's perfect if you are looking an animated movie to watch. 9/10 recommend.
" One of the best Dreamworks and time- travel movies.
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,8,"Ok, this movie came out almost 7 years ago and it did not come out on Netflix until New Year's Eve 2020 so I finally got a chance to watch it and I think it is a decent time-travel film and an amazing Dreamworks film. Talking about the story, it focuses on family, time-travel and history. This time travel movie is not like Back to The Future or 2019's Avengers Endgame, just like the other time-travel films such as Back To The Future which has of course time-travel but also heart and talking about Endgame which has time-travel, action, comedy and heart. This movie has time-travel, heart and history. Talking about George Washington and Agamennon whose history are fictional but quite historical and also getting a cameo from Einstein, this film is quite successful in transforming history to fiction but keeping the historical magic. The relationship between Mr. Peabody (Ty Burrell) and Sherman (Max Charles) is quite appreciated and I also agree. Talking about the chemistry between Sherman (Max Charles) and Penny (Ariel Winter) is also great. Overall, if you could not get a chance to see this movie 7 years ago in theaters, it is available now in Netflix."
" First you think it's good then you reliase
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,6,"After finishing the movie, I was like ""ok, it's funny one, the story is not so bad and the animation is fantastic"" then I reliased. Who is the target audience? Kids, right? No, because in the end the moral of the story is ""let your kid grow up"". There is almost no mortality for children in this one.However, I would find very hard to believe that this movie can be watched without skipping a few minutes here and there with a normal adult brain. Many clich√© and predictable story. So in the end, you can only enjoy the animation and the perfect Mr. Peabody."
" Good for kids, not much else.
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,5,"This movie has many fun sequences which are balanced out with dumb scenes and humor that doesn't land. If your kid wants to learn history, show them this. It has some cool references to historical events. The stuff that isn't time travel though is pretty basic and uninteresting."
" Time changing
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,6,"I didn't watch that much of the show but I enjoyed this movie.Peabody and sherman were great characters, with funny moments and scenes, and learning history along the way."
" CUTE CHARACTERS, RICH CGI, AND ALSO GREAT VISUAL EFFECTS.
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,10,"Rich Storyline and a Great Update for This 60s CharacterI saw the trailers and I expected it to be more concentrated on time travel and not have much of a story line. Well there is. A fantastic one at that! ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" is a wonderful story about a dog who adopts a boy.The film also has lots of animated things to love - like history, comedy, romance, suspense and so much more. To make it even better - characters come to live thanks to the brilliant voice-over actors such as Ty Burrel and Max Charles.The film starts when a young puppy is growing up in different shelters. From a very early age he shows everyone how very special he is. He is intelligent, athletic and smooth. He wins many prizes, but his greatest adventure happens when he adopts a boy. Together they go through multiple adventures and troubles but able to stay together.I love so much about this film. The film itself is fantastic! I love how they take twenty five-minute shows that had old, colored 2-D animation and turn it into modern 3D animation with the use of modern technology.My favorite scene is when they show the story of how Mr. Peabody adopts Sherman. They show points throughout Sherman's little life of great moments, like his first step in 1709. Then it shows how he finds Sherman. That is definitely a sweet and loving part!"
" Marie Antoinette
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,5,"Marie Antoinette never said ""Let them eat cake""
but it is still a good movie. Just that one scene."
" Wait What
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,6,"Mr. Peabody is Ty Burrell? WHAT.
And Leslie Mann? I did not expect that.
Also I'm a bit confused about the ending... Why would that happen?"
" Excellent modernisation
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,8,"Hollywood has given me plenty of reasons to be sceptical of modern remakes of animated classics but this film more than surpassed my expectations. The characters are funny, the time travel plot leads to many new scenarios and the rivalry with Penny is very entertaining. Even though the different time periods seem unrelated, the story all builds up to something bigger."
" Very poor; a convoluted watch-once film
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,2,This movie is very poor; it's a convoluted watch-once film. It's full of stupidity and plot holes; they forgot about the other Penny. I'll concede that it will make you laugh twice but you could spend your money and time watching much better movies.
" Dog-tor Who?
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"I'm surprised I liked this as much as I did, considering it's Dreamworks. While Mr Peabody's puns get old after a while, there's other non-pun jokes and visual gags to make up for it. It's also surprisingly educational for the most part. It's like an animated ""Doctor Who."" Or rather ""Dog""tor Who. Mr. Peabody even has a bowtie. They had an opportunity to make some Doctor Who jokes and missed it. The animation is fluid, and impressive. This is probably the best Dreamworks movie I've seen since ""Turbo.""
Grade: A 9/10 4.5/5 stars"
" Great film
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,2,10 out of 10 I like it alot.
" Top movie for all ages.
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,10,"Funny, intelligent and a great story. I used to watch the rocky and bullwinkle show as a kid. Couldn't have complimented it any better. Love to see a second one."
" A fun little story!
",2019-12-20 00:00:00,6,"A funny little story about Sherman, his friend and a dog, Mr. Peabody, who seems to be the father of Sherman. A quirky little history lesson with Einstein doing a Midnight Cowboy (1969) reference. In my opinion, it is no way near of being as good as some of the older Pixar movies such as monster's inc, Toy story and a personal favourite of mine, Ratatouille. However it is a amusing hour and a half of a pretty well made movie. It does a way better job portraying the meaning of what being a human is, than Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, and it's not even three hours long!"
" Unrealistic movies are the best
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,5,The movie starts out fine. The characters are fine. The animation is fine.However midway the movie slows down and loses that charm that it once had.On a character note sherman makes silly decisions just so he can impress a girl that hates him. I call this pathetic.Overall the movie starts off great. Midway it slows down and by the end it runs out of gas.This is a Movie that I've always wanted to see for years I finally see it and I'm mildly satisfied.
" Mr. Peabody and Sherman
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,4,All the characters really got on my nerves. And a dog adopting a boy sounds even more ridiculous when you say it out loud.
" Ted Key rolling over in his grave
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,3,Ty Burrell's voice was on point. Other than that. Bland. Unnecessary plot devices. Took away from the whimsical intelligence of its predecessor. Good background noise but that is about it
" A bit of a mess
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,6,"I wasn't aware that this was based on an old TV series when I saw it; I just watched it with fresh eyes as a stand-alone film. The animation is good, but the plot is mostly a convoluted mess. The characterisations and script are dated and cliched. The historic references are interesting and entertaining if woefully inaccurate. What saves the film is the speediness of it (very fast-moving), it's one of those films that some children would enjoy, but few adults would."
" IT IS AN ADOPTIVE RELATIONSHIP
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,7,"Having grown up watching the original cartoon, I was a bit disappointed in the film. That is not to say kids won't enjoy it, but an old guy like me will just shake his head. On the plus side of the coin is the modern animation. They managed to keep the pun aspect of the cartoon, although my selective memory believes the older cartoon was more intellectual in that regard, On the negative side was the voices. I didn't like them. Sherman was okay, but not great. Peabody sounded like ""Uncle Martin"" from ""My Favorite Martian"" trying to imitate someone on ""The Big Bang Theory."" Hint: They named the blond ""Penny.""Sherman ends up developing feelings for the most contemptible girl in school simply because she is blond with big blue eyes. When social services shows a prejudice against a dog adopting a boy, even though the court approved it, I couldn't help think there was an underlying message for child viewers that ""different"" parents can adopt children too. Not that I am against gay people adopting children, I just thought it was interesting for the creators of the film to introduce this side bar.I did like Ariel Winter as the voice of Penny.I liked the ending of past individuals using modern devices"
" Nothing Special, But Not Bad
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,6,"Nothing new or groundbreaking here, unfortunately. They really could have made this a lot better by tweaking just a few things.Overall, however, this is still a decent animation. There are some solid laughs and a few very fun moments in here. Recommend for anyone trying to get their cartoon fix."
" Educational and entertaining fun for kids of all ages.
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,8,"An educational and entertaining fun animation with a good range of historical settings and characters. Great animation and an ok story with a moral message, although the inclusion of the villain seemed unnecessary, especially as they were one of the weaker aspects of the film."
" A fun animated adventure that got overshadowed.
",2018-09-21 00:00:00,8,"Mr. Peabody and Sherman isn't the greatest animated film ever, but it's also not the worst by any means. Largely overshadowed by The Lego Movie on release, Peabody definitely was the black sheep between the two and a single viewing explains why, but I digress. While the film does have plenty of historical humor you would expect, it is first and foremost a kids and family film, so expect plenty of puns and a few fart jokes. The latter certainly makes this film a bit more of a chore to watch because the history jokes are funny on all levels, even some of the puns. 
 
Voice acting was good enough for all the characters, but that's all it really is, good enough. I feel like a lot of actors could have been replaced and I wouldn't have noticed in terms of quality nor would I miss any of them if they were switched. Even Stephen Colbert wasn't too memorable, which is disappointing (Especially when you consider his flawless stint on Rick and Morty). Now all of this negativity certainly doesn't ignore the 8 rating I have given Peabody, because the animation and story certainly make up for the missteps the film makes. Ancient Egypt had beautiful sand dunes and felt dusty enough to feel irritating, the battle of Troy was exciting and captured the chaos of the fight perfectly, and the opening in the French Revolution was just plain funny.Mr. Peabody and Sherman isn't going to stay in your memory the way Toy Story or The Lion King did, but it's funny and gorgeously animated which only sugarcoats its fun story baked into a cake for Marie Antoinette."
" Bad history
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,2,"This film gives itself a huge pat on the back for debunking the Washington-and-the-cherry-tree story, and then turns right around and peddles the myth that Marie-Antoinette said, ""Let them eat cake."" Most movies about history end up repeating legends and lies, but they don't generally insist at the same time that they're superior historians of the truth. The old Sherman and Peabody cartoons did silly takeoffs on history that weren't accurate, but they weren't pretending to be; they were just for fun, and as a kid, I understood that. Some aspects of this new version could really confuse children who are trying to figure out how to understand and learn about history, and the braggadocio is just annoying anyway."
" Great animation movie for a family outing
",2018-05-30 00:00:00,8,This is a sweet film and harkens back to the old school style of animation. It succeeds for this very reason- this is a fun film by Dreamworks which can be enjoyed by the entire family. The voice actors do a fine job and the fact that no one is a known face or voice only helps assist the movie. (Great animation movie for a family outing)
" An outstanding update of the genius dog and his adopted son
",2018-05-25 00:00:00,7,"I rented this movie from the library some time ago and enjoyed it. There were plenty of celebrity cameos and lots of good moments with people in history. I hadn't seen this many historical figures in a modern setting since Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Plus, that time travel machine. And all the visuals and a good story which kept me interested. The voice acting was pretty good too. A good way to consume time on a Saturday if you want to watch an animated movie."
" Fun and clever.
",2018-04-08 00:00:00,8,"This is a pretty good movie. Aside from a few minor plot holes and dumb moments, I have no complaints. The animation, characters, and story are all fun and interesting. I'd recommend watching this."
" Fulfilling funtime
",2017-12-30 00:00:00,8,"Watched this last night, wasn't expecting much but to my surprise it catches your attention after sometime with it's great adventures of time travelling and little bumps of comedy. Have complete set of emotional values that every Father and Son should have. 
A good family time movie, worth your time and also gives you some history lessons that's keep you interested."
" An unexpected great!
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,10,"Mr. Peabody, a highly intelligent dog and very different from all his kind, becomes the first to adopt a human being. Together with his son, they use the secret time machine to travel into the past and explore all the corners of history. Everything goes normal until Sherman goes to school and has a fight with one of his colleagues. This event triggers an unexpected visit from child care which are determined to take Sherman away, but Peabody is determined to change their mind. He organizes a special dinner with the child's parents and the representative from child care but his plans are soon to be altered by Sherman's ego who will ultimately put the stability of the time continuum into peril.Although it begins atypical, this movie presents an interesting story featuring a dog who can do practically anything and his attempts to maintain the course of time flowing in the right direction after his son and the latter's colleague travel back unattended and without permission. It is very impressive with the dog's abilities and the animated special effects which provide a special aura to the atmosphere.Its story is interesting and although not groundbreaking, it manages to keep your attention throughout the whole picture. Despite the fact that Sherman is quite a troublemaker, mainly due to his friend, he plays an important role in the movie's intrigue and slowly starts to mature in order to impress his father. This movie came as a pleasant surprise for me as I wasn't expecting such a quality animation from this title but it proved me wrong and I enjoyed every single part of it."
" Fun adventure with time travel jeopardy
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,7,"First part of the movie i would give 12 out of 10 points. Really fun adventure film, not only for kids. Since the dog hypnotized girls parents, i waited to see also how they arrive back, but what never happened. For me from this part when they left Mr. Peabody in old Creece, it went kind of messy, off-road rally (like lots of weird cartoons). From this part i would give 2 out of 10. So, median score i get than 7."
" Nice
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,10,This movie is so fun.I highly recommend watching it. funny and entertaining. Kids love it. Adults love it.Everybody loves it. the story of the movie is amazing as well. Adventure roller coaster of a movie. Good screen play. This film has some of the finest voice actings I have ever heard in an animated feature
" Deliberate Misogyny - Very Offensive and Shameful
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,1,"There is so much sexism in this horrendous stinker of a movie that it has obviously been deliberate. The hateful portrait that was displayed of an early women's advocate, the obvious lack of female historical figures (not a single one in the final scenes), the mean female stereotypes and caricatures, the language that deliberately omits girls and women (all dogs need a boy, all men and dogs are created equal...why not people, or children??) and most disgusting of all, one of the female characters is abducted and nothing is said about it. In fact, the audience is supposed to think this act of violence upon a female character is a good thing. So much for respect for women.I can only wonder what is wrong with the male director and male scriptwriter - their disdain for women and girls seeps through this repulsive little film and watching it with my daughters and my sons, I felt very angry at these men who so wantonly and deliberately tried to attack women and girls - no doubt their core viewers. It sickened me and there is no way I will put this shameful movie on for my children ever again. Misogyny is not a trait I want to promote, unlike those who made this rubbish."
" Beter than expected!
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,10,"When i saw the trailer i thought that it won't be so good, c'mon a dog adopting a child etc. In the beginning i got a little irritated by Peabody's look, But it was alright. The movie was awesome from the beginning till the end. I can't believe what people are saying about this. But for me it was an awesome movie. A DON'T MISS INDEED"
" A funny and clever adaptation of the '60s cartoon.
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,8,"Out of all the cartoons that aired on television in the 1960's, the best one by far was probably ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"". While the animation was cheap (as most shows were back in the day), it's was great featuring some funny laughs and memorable characters that will be remembered for years to come. They were also many other segments during the show with the most famous being¬†one involving a intelligent canine named Mr. Peabody and his boy Sherman who go through many various places in time thanks to Peabody's latest invention, the WABAC.¬†Flash forward fifty years later, and the duo have now appeared for the first time¬†on the big screen thanks to the help through DreamWorks Animation and ""Lion King"" director Rob Minkoff, and I can happily say that I was satisfied with the results they brought. ""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" has the same charm and clever humor that the show had while adding the right amount of heart leading¬†to a very enjoyable movie.For the past years, the gifted¬†Mr. Peabody (Ty Burell) has been tutoring his adopted son Sherman (Max Charles) on history while using a time machine called the WABAC. They have gone through many different places at different times, like the French Revolution or the days of Van Gogh, the list goes on. Having¬†travelled thru time for many years, Sherman has become a very educated student in history which angers a jealous girl named Penny (Ariel Winter) leading to a fight that ends in the principals office. Worried that Sherman might get taken away by an angry Child Protectives Services agent (Allison Janney), Peabody sets out to make peace between the two kids hoping they can¬†reconcile. However, Sherman's only way of impressing the girl is the time machine, which results in her getting lost in Ancient Egypt. After warning Peabody about the incident, Sherman and him go off on a crazy time adventure to try get Penny home.While many other time travel movies have basically outdone flaws that were present in the show (""Back to the Future"" is a notable¬†example), the story still feels rather faithful and funny. One notable addition was¬†a new backstory involved with Peabody finding¬†Sherman which I¬†liked¬†better than the cartoon as I thought¬†it lead¬†to the movie having some good heart to it. The story,however,¬†isn't¬†without its flaws. While I heavily enjoyed the bits involving the time travel, the subplot about Sherman being taken away was very unnecessary. It felt very forced into the story and even to the worst part of the movie which, without spoiling, involves one of the characters defending the other. ¬†The animation was pretty good. While it does have some awkward moments¬†involving¬†characters drawn specifically in a 2D format being turned into computer models, I thought the environments created felt faithful. The colors also popped out of the screen which I always love to see in DreamWorks' movies. The characters are also pretty fun. I particularly enjoyed the father-son¬†relationship of Peabody and Sherman. I thought it was handled perfectly which lead to some good emotional moments. The new characters might turn people¬†off though. While I thought Penny was a nice addition and thought she had a good chemistry with Sherman, I did not like the CPS agent. She¬†was a perfect example of a one-dimensional character as the only emotion I got from her was anger. That's it. It was frustrating to see no other emotions coming from her. However, it's really a nitpick.""Mr. Peabody and Sherman"" was a very fun movie. ¬†I thought that, despite it's problems, it had a fun story, some good¬†animation, and some really funny characters. While children might get confused by the movie at parts, I think that the film will entertain¬†them. I certainly was entertained, and I think that's worth the price of admission."
" Uninspired but Decent
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,6,"Sweetness and good-natured humor seep from the pores of Mr. Peabody & Sherman, an animated adventure film based on the ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" shorts. While not as inventive as 2014's Lego Movie, Minkoff and company managed to bring the 1950s cartoon into the 21st century without completely abandoning the fun self-awareness of the original. A mixture of Indiana-Jones-style adventure, fast pacing and an onslaught of dog puns make this a decent, if somewhat uninspired, outing. It's the story of a genius dog and his human son who travel through time and space learning history and causing havoc along the way. As with most time travel stories, the stakes are high but the peril never quite connects. There are some sloppy moments and missed opportunities especially in the time travel elements. When you have all of time and space at your fingertips, you shouldn't squander that opportunity. However, the focus is clearly on the innocent humor, great action and father-son relationship. Burrell nails it as the witty dog-dad, describing the science of everything and keeping it light, all while saving the day. The set pieces are stunning, recalling the under-appreciated Adventures of Tintin in their exuberance. In addition, its study of parent/child relationships is touching and attentive. Sure, Dreamworks is still trying to be a bit too hip, forcing time-sensitive one-liners and unneeded innuendos when simple and tight storytelling would suffice. Yet while it's far from groundbreaking or completely successful, it still manages to be much better than most of the wasted garbage that's been dumped on the theatres this year."
" The Shermanator.
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,7,"Taking a look at the TV listings of ""family"" films getting shown,I was intrigued to find that along with the major blockbusters,that more overlooked animated titles were being shown. Only knowing the title previously from spoofs on Family Guy,I felt it was time to meet the real Mr. Peabody & Sherman.The plot:Since going to court to get the right for a dog to adopt a human boy (!)Mr. Peabody uses a time machine to travel across all historical eras with his son Sherman. Getting in a fight with Penny,Sherman runs the risk of being expelled from school. Wanting fix things,Peabody invites Penny and her parents round for dinner. Mending things with her family,Peabody pushes Sherman to find ways to fix things with Penny. Struggling to find something in common,Sherman breaks Peabody's rule,and gives Penny a time machine tour.View on the film:Rolling out with a loose history lesson,the screenplay by Craig Wright/ Robert Ben Garant/Thomas Lennon & Michael McCullers bends lively Sci-Fi with quirky Comedy,as the square pegs of Peabody and Sherman are delightfully placed in historical events that have a surprisingly risqu√© chop (including a guillotine!) Sprinkling Penny and her family into the time fold,the writers deliver a kind note on family bond that skips becoming sickly sweet thanks to dry wit humour and an energetic time travel adventure which allows Peabody to cross watches with Washington and Antoinette.Witnessing some of the biggest events in history,director Rob Minkoff gives the movie a zany shine,lit by crisp blues and dusty yellows taking Peabody and Sherman across Egypt and deep into the criss-crossing time tunnels. Retaining their original design, Minkoff gives each of the characters distinctive rough edges,that emphasis the off-beat comedy exchanges in Peabody and Sherman's time keeping."
