" Kung Fu Panda 3
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,5,"The first two films are pretty much the same quality, good fun for the kids and not bad for the grownups, I had the feeling that the third film in the trilogy would be exactly the same, but I was prepared for that. Basically, in the spirit realm, elderly tortoise Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) fights against his old comrade turned adversary, spirit warrior yak Kai (J.K. Simmons), who has defeated all the other kung fu masters in the realm and taken their chi. Kai traps Oogway and takes his chi but is warned that he will be stopped by the Dragon Warrior, he takes this as a challenge and returns the mortal realm. Meanwhile, Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) announces his retirement from teaching and passes the role of teacher to the Dragon Warrior, Po (Jack Black), who realises that teaching kung fu is not as easy and injures the Furious Five. Po feels crushed with his failure, but Shifu advises Po that instead of trying to be like him, he should try to be himself. Po returns home where he meets a panda, Li Shan (Bryan Cranston), who turns out to be his long-lost biological father. They quickly bond with each other, much to the jealousy of Po's adoptive father Mr. Ping (James Hong). After introducing Li to Shifu and his friends, the Valley of Peace is invaded by an army of jade zombies, or ""jombies"", which Kai has created from the chi of past kung fu masters. After defending the valley from these creatures, Po and the Five learns through research that Oogway and Kai were once brothers-in-arms and close friends. After Oogway was injured in battle, Kai carried him to a village of pandas who healed him with their mastery of chi. The pandas taught Oogway how to utilise chi to help others. However, Kai wanted the power for himself and tried to steal the chi from the pandas, forcing Oogway to banish him to the spirit realm by ending his life. To defeat Kai, Po must learn to master the use of chi himself. Li offers to teach him by taking him to his secret panda village. While Shifu and the Furious Five stay behind to deal with Kai, Mr. Ping stows away to try and drive a wedge between Po and Li. Although Po is eager to learn chi, Li tells him he must first learn the relaxed life of a panda in the village. Kai takes the chi of every kung fu master in China, including Shifu and the Furious Five, except Tigress (Angelina Jolie), who escapes the subsequent destruction of the Jade Palace. She finds Po and the other pandas to warn them that Kai is coming. Afraid, Li and the pandas prepare to run away. When Po begs Li to teach him the secret chi technique, Li confesses that he lied about knowing it, fear he would lose his son again. Heartbroken and enraged, Po walks away and isolates himself to train vigorously and prepare to fight Kai. Mr. Ping realises that Po has become happier with his biological father in his life, so he tells Li that Po being mad at him is part of being a parent, but that Po will forgive him. Ping then tells him that Po will need them both to stop Kai. Li goes back to Po and says the pandas will help him fight Kai and his army. Realising what had previously made him fail as a teacher, Po agrees and teaches them to use their everyday activities as kung fu skills. Kai arrives and sends his minions to capture Po, while the pandas, Ping, and Tigress fight them, distracting Kai. They defeat the jombie army, but when Po tries to use his signature Wuxi Finger Hold on Kai to send him back to the spirit realm, Kai reveals that it only works on mortals, not spirit warriors. Kai and Po fight each other, until eventually Po uses the Wuxi Finger Hold on himself while gripping Kai around the neck, transporting them both to the spirit realm. They fight again, and Kai subdues Po and begins to steal his chi. Using what they learned from Po, his friends and family use their chi to empower him. Po breaks free and harnesses their chi to create a giant dragon figure and quickly overpowers Kai. After taunting Kai, Po then gives him the power which overwhelms him, destroying him and restoring all the fallen masters and the Five to normal. In an ethereal golden pond, Oogway appears to Po and informs him that his journey as the Dragon Warrior is complete, he is declared to be his successor. Po chooses to return to the mortal world, and he and his extended family all return to the valley, where they continue practicing kung fu and chi. Also starring Jackie Chan as Monkey, Seth Rogen as Mantis, Lucy Liu as Viper, David Cross as Crane, Kate Hudson as Mei Mei, Wayne Knight as Big Fun / Hom-Lee, Al Roker as Sum, Jean-Claude Van Damme as Master Croc, Blue Peter's Radzi Chinyanganya as Mi, Pax Jolie-Pitt as Yoo, Knox Jolie-Pitt as Ku Ku, Zahara Jolie-Pitt as Meng Meng, and Shiloh Jolie-Pitt as Shuai Shuai. Black remains likeable as the title character, Simmons is suited to voicing the big villain, and the supporting cast also do well. As I expected, the quality of the story, the animation and everything else was just the same as before, but there is nothing wrong with that, it was a fun family animated comedy adventure. Worth watching!"
" Not as good as the previous movies but still solid
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,7,"There are two main things that happen in this film. One is the return of Po's father. The other is the bull-like creature, Kai, swinging his luminous daggers around and stealing people's chi. In terms of storyline it's simple, but all over the place at the same time. Kai is on his way to steal the chi of Po and the others to become even more powerful than he already is. After Po is reunited with his father, it is made clear to him that that only a chi master can defeat Kai; so Po must journey to the secret panda village in order to master chi before Kai comes to get him. It turns out Pandas were historically chi masters Eventually Kai finds where Po is and there's a battle.The reunion and father-son bonding scenes in the temple were actually quite nice (as was the jealousy of Po's stepfather, Mr Ping) and I wish there were more scenes like that because for the most part I found myself bored. One of the key draws for these films is that they're funny.In terms of the new characters I kinda liked Kai, and actually possibly even wanted him to win, which is really bad. Some of the pandas in the secret village were good. When Po is talking to them he says things like 'you look like me, but a baby; you look like me but old; you look like me, but fatter' and so on, was funny. There was a glaring error at one point. When the village is under attack from Kai, Tigress runs to the secret panda village to get Po. But how did she find the panda village so easily? It was meant to be secret! Overall, It wasn't an awful movie, but it was not on par with the first two instalment."
" A worthy inclusion to the series.
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,10,"While not really outdoing the first two films, Kung Fu Panda 3 has all the trappings of a fine third entry in an acclaimed film franchise. Some of the humor feels sillier compared to the prequels, but eventually gets better as the conflict is developed. The film is fast-paced and gripping as it delivers a successful blend of action and comedy, served with heartfelt father-son moments that continue to warm my heart. It also doesn't eschew the philosophy or the magical score that aided the first two films in a great way.The voice acting is still good, and there's nothing to complain about. The story is written in a way that while it may initially seem silly, it only ends up getting better and stronger as it goes on to unfold. The makers continue to serve us with first-rate action sequences. Since I watched the film in 3D, I enjoyed it even more than I guess I could've enjoyed in 2D. In the second half of the story, you'll get a lot of emotionally resonant as well as exciting moments that will eventually make you forgive blemishes if any.All in all, this is a pretty good film and a worthy inclusion to the series. If you loved the first two films, especially the second one, you might be expecting another strong plot, which it does have, except it doesn't feel as intense. Nevertheless, this is a family-friendly action comedy that works very easily for kids and families. And the philosophical messages it offers are not easy to forget. I was completely satisfied by the time it ended."
" Not as clever or funny as the other two, but still good
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,5,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is definitely my least favourite in the trilogy, it has the least interesting villain and the film's characters a bit less ingenious. It still gets praise for the action sequences and animation but I feel like the stakes are lower and it's lost a bit of heart that made the original so great, as well as this I just didn't find the jokes or humour as funny as in the first one, more cringe inducing than anything else in the delivery of some.5/10: Passable entertainment but not as great as the other two"
" kinda felt weird...
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,6,"Compared to the other kung fu panda movies, this one was a bit of a strange experience, at first i wasnt able to figure out why but now i think i can say why. there are 2 reasons as to why this movie fell flat, number one is the inclusion of ""chi"" in this movie, its a magical thing that plays a heavy influence on the movies plot, im not going to get into the exact details of what it is (go watch the movie if you want to know how it works) but the problem is that its magic, in a kung fu panda movie. now the previous 2 movies did have some magic in them, but it was never nearly this heavily plot relevant by any means, the last 2 movies were mostly about learning self discipline and control, not controlling magical forces to defeat a ""spirit warrior."" at best, the magic in the past 2 movies was just the icing on the cake, here though this the main focus, which made me feel like i was watching some fanfiction written by an 8 year old. now for the second problem with the movie; the villain kai, or more specifically, his abilities. the movie is very inconsistent with kais abilities, he seems to have the ability to instantly turn people into his own jade zombies if he can just get within 5 feet of them, but for some reason he only does it when the plot needs him to, all the other times he just ""fights"" everyone for seemingly no reason until the writers decide thats enough and he turns them into jade zombies. the movie never explains how exactly his powers work and it seems like the writers did that on purpose to make things easier for them. also the movie had a few major conveniences throughout it, which was annoying. im not gonna spoil it here but youll definetely notice it, especially the one during the final battle. overall it it just fell flat in my opinion, give this one a watch if you want but dont expect it to be as good as any of the previous ones"
" Spirit Warrior
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,7,"Round three. Fight!Po (Jack Black) aka the Dragon Warrior is back for a third episode. He's just as jolly, just as loveable, and just as hungry. After defeating Tai Lung in part one and Shen in part two, Po has to face Kai (J.K. Simmons), a kung-fu master from the spirit world. After taking Oogway's chi in the spirit world, Kai has opened a path to the mortal world in order to take the chi of the Dragon Warrior.As in part two, we get even more backstory about Po here in part three. Po's birth father, Li (Bryan Cranston), has found Po and has come to take him home to a secret panda village. There Po hopes to learn how to summon his chi in order to defeat Kai.While not quite as funny as one and two, KFP3 holds its own. We get some new characters which mean new voices: J.K. Simmons, Bryan Cranston, Kate Hudson, and four of the Jolie-Pitt kids. KFP3 is solid for a third installment."
" Great finale
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,8,"I really like the premise of this film. Po finally manages to meet his father and the other pandas. There is a great threat that defeats the old masters and is now coming for the pandas. Whatever is Po to do? He is way over his head but he finds a way. This film has everything we love from the Kung Fu Panda series - action, comedy and emotions."
" funny
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,8,"Po must protect the villagers and practice new kung fu while becoming a real kung fu panda. How difficult this process is, I really like this movie"
" A great movie
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,9,"It's still a great movie which represents China though I have to admit that they should do something to retrieve its declining scores.
It seems that the plot is more exciting than the first one and second one of the series.It is a progress."
" Did I just watch a Dragon Ball episode? Epic and a worthy finale to the trilogy. Dreamworks did it again!
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,8,"I have recently rediscovered myself and my taste in animated movies. Until recently I only had eyes for Disney productions and Dreamworks' traditional animation (Sinbad, Prince of Egypt, El Dorado) and their first computer animated Shrek movies. I had memories of watching Kung Fu Panda and not seeing the appeal, now as a 24 year old my eyes have been opened. I believe Kung Fu Panda and How to Train your Dragon are 2 of the best trilogies I have ever seen not only in animation but in movie franchises.The style, the tone, the essence, the spirit, the themes, they all fit together like if they were a miniseries with no gaps between productions. I said it once and I'll say it as many times as they are needed, DreamWorks know where to take their franchises. If they nailed the idea, the sequels not only expand it but add new themes that, while some riskier than others, they fit well with the rest and everythign feels self-contained.Again, the characterisations are sublime, the return of Oogway was legendary, the final battle was legendary and I believe that's exactly what they went for. It feels epic because it is the conclusion of all the loose threads. The throwbacks to questions that find answers in this movie. A pitch perfect use of symbolism, mystical and ethereal imagery to represent the inseccurities and the life lessons one has to learn. And as I said with the other two, this movie keeps the fighting spectacle. It is jaw-dropping how anime-ish it can get with this sort of fights now that the full potential of the ""martial art"" has been reached.I thought about, I thought that because in the previous movies they touched on very magical and mystical aspects but they never got to deep into it. So I wondered if they'd ever tackle the whole Chi aspect, the life energy within that the religion preaches. It was ethereal and whimsical. I don't want to spoil anything else, but it is magical and epic.IN CONCLUSION, if you are reading this you have seen the other two movies and if you liked them just let you know you are in for a treat. It might not be the better one of the three, but i is let loose as it is over stylised many times, the plot is pretty simplistic and straight to the point, and it even rushes some times. However, it is enthralling, amusing and a really gorgeous looking movie. It's worth it just for the finale. How they treated the whole dad-reencounter and the dynamic between the two parents, the portrayal of the other pandas was quirky and provided good comedy. All in all, this last movie was about Po (all of them where, but still, this one dug even more in finding who he really is). The soundtrack is amazing and epic as always (although I knew of the song they used from Imagine Dragons and after hearing it 3 and 4 times it grew a bit tiring, like if I had it in loop all the time). And Oogway, my favorite character, was given some backstory and more screentime so that's a mega win for me.But yeah, this is a Dragon Ball episode, Goku (Po) does the dragon attack(chi dragon attack) and bursts through the bad guys chest (it just gets in, but the inspiration is clear)"
" Kung fu panda 3
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,9,"Time to go back into the world of DreamWorks animation. I had read more information about the company's corporate shakeup that not only involved several people replace and relocated, but it also involved the closing of the Northern California studios and the reduction of the output of feature films. It seemed like a formidable movie fiscally, until the release of last year's Home, which I mentioned that I didn't care for. I guess I wasn't the only one as the critical reviews were tepid, and the box office numbers were low (not a failure, but not even close to a hit). Has DreamWorks truly learned?If the new original features aren't doing well, then the next strategy would be to take advantage of some of their past hits. Shrek, Madagascar, and How to Train Your Dragon seem to be the franchises that they like push and make more sequels and television programs. I like those movies (except Madagascar), though my favorite is the Kung Fu Panda films. This is the ultimate ""don't judge by its cover"" story as it's dumb title is really a silly martial arts story that teaches a lot about Chinese philosophy. Po's training is taken the next step in Kung Fu Panda 3.Master Shifu (played by Dustin Hoffman) has announced that's he's stepping down as the teacher of the Furious Five: Master Tigress (played by Angelina Jolie), Master Crane (played by David Cross), Master Mantis (played by Seth Rogan), Master Viper (played by Lucy Liu) and Master Monkey (played by Jackie Chan). Shifu says that the only one who can teach them is the dragon warrior, Po (played by Jack Black). Po is still his silly self and doesn't feel like he can be a good teacher. It's evident on the his first day when the masters are unimpressed.While visiting his adoptive father Mr. Ping, a large panda named Li Shan (played by Bryan Cranston) comes looking for his long lost son. Po is excited to finally meet his father let alone another panda, who were thought to have been gone. Shifu knows that the Panda's were masters of controlling chi, so he tells Po to go with his real father to discover chi. Within the hidden Panda village, Po learns more about being one of his own and learning more about his family.Meanwhile, Kai (played by J.K. Simmons), a powerful spirit that can take away one's chi has entered the mortal world in order to gain chi from all the Masters. Tigress shows up at Po's village to reveal that all the masters have been taken by Kai and it's up to Po to fight him and teach Kung- Fu to all the pandas.I really appreciate DreamWorks for not only taking Chinese martial arts and philosophy seriously, but for taking the story of a Kung-Fu fighting panda just as seriously. Not only is Po really learning more about what his skills can do, but really seems to be growing as a personor a bear.Kung Fu Panda 3 still boasts some of the most beautiful computer animation I've seen from DreamWorks. It is so atmospheric, that this is one of the few movie worlds I'd love to live in.The characters from the previous movies are all back and play up their parts just fine. The newcomers Bryan Cranston and J.K. Simmons both bring in their own spark, fitting in just fine. Without giving anything away, I only have two gripes. While J.K. Simmons does well as Kai, he's not as intimidating as Gary Oldman from Kung Fu Panda 2. Also, when Po's father Li Shan make a big discovery about himself, it's a little rushed.I'll give this eight Chinese scrolls out of ten. This is a part of a series that is just so funny and beautiful, that I find it hard to find much to nitpick. Kung Fu Panda 3 is a great piece of family entertainment that should get both the parents and children engaged. I hope these characters continue Kung Fu fighting for a while!"
" Entertaining and funny but flat story
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,7,"After the fantastic first movie where Po is a classic hero after being a loser, where the villain has his own story and where the others play a role making Po the character he is, came a second movie with a dark, deep and personal story greatly told, and now we have just an excuse to make Po even more bada** fighting a villain nobody cares for and who came out of nowhere. This makes me sad because it was getting more ""mature"". But I understand it is a kids movie, so it's still entertaining and pleasant to watch, and I'm pretty sure the kids love this movie."
" the performances still good.
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,8,"More kinda like the original, this sequel improves the story of Po and manages to make me apreciate very much this movie.The animation is better than ever, and the performances still good."
" As good-looking as ever
",2020-04-23 00:00:00,8,"Very good, funny and perfect action, Kung Fu fighting is also vivid, the panda baby inside is super cute. Aside from the plot, the animation is as good as ever, and this time the animation incorporates other style elements, a bright, simple paper-cut style. The plot is also reasonable, the Chinese elements are very strong and worth watching!"
" Kung Fu Blanda
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,6,"It's official. ""Madagascar"" is the only perfect Dreamworks trilogy. How this got an 80% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes is beyond me. It's not completely horrible, but it's not amazing either. It's just ok. It just exists. It's ""meh."" The plot is pretty much ""Madagascar 2"" all over again. In fact, it's pretty much every Dreamworks sequel with a ""2"" in the title all over again. Main character meets long lost parents. Whoop de doo. Dreamworks has only done this in ""Shrek 2,"" ""Madagascar 2"", and ""How to Train Your Dragon 2."" Think of a better plot for sequels, Dreamworks. There's not much originality here. There's even a scene after Po first meets his dad where they fanboy over all the ancient Kung fu artifacts (you know, like how Po did in the first one.) Even some of the dialogue is rehashed word for word in this scene. Also, some scenes from earlier in the film are later reused again, literally exactly the same. Lazy!!! The ending also feels ripped from the last Harry Potter. The villain steals the souls of the other Kung fu masters in order to become immortal . (Horcruxes.) There's more similarities but spoilers so...but trust me, if you've seen Harry Potter 7, you've seen this. There are some positives with the animation though. It's incredibly detailed. Close ups of the pandas' arms deserve to be freeze-framed so you can appreciate every individual arm hair. But plot wise, and even humor wise, this plot had nothing new to offer. Stay home and watch the first movie, and every Dreamworks sequel with a ""2"" in it. You'll pretty much be getting this anyway.
Grade: C+. 6/10. 2.5/5 stars"
" Decent
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,6,It was a decent movie but previous movies were much much better.
" So funny and amazing
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,7,"Not quite as good as Kung Fu Panda 2 since it does rehash some plot elements from Kung Fu Panda 2, but Kung Fu Panda 3 is still a solid entry in this kung fu fighting franchise."
" Nothing more than a cash-in
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,3,"The third instalment of this animated franchise is by far the weakest. It lacks the fresh origin story of the original and well-developed expansion of the sequel to instead deliver a retread and mish-mash of previous themes and tropes. The action is broader, the villains more outlandishly supernatural, and sadly the silly humour is back and threatening to overwhelm. The ensemble cast remains fun, but the format is wearing thin by now and this feels like nothing more than a cash-in."
" Kung Fu Panda 3 : Rocks.
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,8,KP 3 resurrects the energy of the story it brought from the first. More funnier and graphically beautiful the film maker establishes strong back story from the first two and also brings the enhancements of the scope of the characters.The best thing I like about this is the fun and jokes it provides the audience and it is re-energizing entrance to the franchise.
" Too bad for putting politics in movies
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,1,"The Abominable movie brought me here, and I gave it a rating. The producer put the nine-dash line political issue in the film. Too bad. I boycotted this company."
" Wait
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,7,Wait who the hell is rating those movies now why is it so overrated
" My Review!
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,7,"It focuses on an upgrade to Kung Fu. If you ask me, this part is challenging the first of the trilogy. It's kiddish, sweet and funny. A movie kids as well as adults will remember.
So, clear your schedule and the big screens is the right way.
P.S: The first one still holds the top rank!!!Pace Out!"
" I loved it!
",2019-08-27 00:00:00,10,I think this is the best one of the trilogy. I hope they make a 4.
" Kung Fu Panda 3
",2019-07-31 00:00:00,4,"Too many overweight panda jokes. Unlike the last two movies, they aren't funny."
" Daddy's Home: Panda Edition
",2019-06-20 00:00:00,7,"While decent, this movie really didn't need to be made. It has a central topic of fatherhood which isn't quite as well executed as it could've been. Most of the humor aims to center around the natural humor in fat pandas. This humor feels like the directors changed their target audience to be younger and also to appeal more to Happy Meal toys. They definitely ran out of interesting villains and put in an underdeveloped guy who likes green. I want to say that fighting his own team is well utilized as a battle mechanic here but it honestly doesn't make for exciting action. Decent movie in quality but one that feels pointless."
" Not nearly enough awesome Kung fu.
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,8,"The clear and obvious conclusion of this trilogy, ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is filled with the same jokes and action of its predecessors. Even the music (an interesting rendition of an Imagine Dragons) is a not-so-subtle or apologetic nod to the climax of this film. While the kung fu is still amazing (as it should always be with the control of CGI), there almost seems to not be quite enough of it."
" No match for the predecessors.
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,6,"Ambivalence reloaded ! The innocent humor, the charm of all the characters continues to impress, 10/10 for that ! The philosophical nerve seems lost except when first Shifu and then Po exemplify 'I ence reloaded ! The innocence, splendid humor and the charm of the characters, even the new Pandas, continues, 10/10 for that ! Animation - as splendid as ever The philosophical nerve seems to be gradually dwindling, there were only two times I felt it - once when both Shifu and Po practice 'I am trying to turn you into YOU' and when Master Oogway reveals that he chose Po as he had seen the past and through the future. The villain, Kai, fails to make a mark, seems more like a backstreet goon. The plot itself is cliched and handled hastily, for example, how can accomplished masters like Ox, Croc. make a mistake of directly engaging Kai and losing their Chi ? The end(everyone 'donating' their Chi, the Spirit Well etc.) is unbecoming, especially, when this movie is desperately attempting to resemble the first part. Even Hans Zimmer disappoints - no welcome additions to the earlier classics !"
" Another fun movie with Po
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,6,"The Good Stuff (from best to least best)1.) The animation in this movie is beyond superb. We've come to expect beautiful art styles in the Kung Fu Panda movies, but this movie takes another step in ensuring every shot looks absolutely stunning2.) Hans Zimmer's score does great work in enhancing all the impactful scenes. From the very first scenes in the spirit world, to the grandiose theme of the main villain Kai.3.) This film is just plain fun. As expected from Po at this point, he is a lovable anti-hero of sorts that is just trying his best to be apart of the world of martial artists he always looked up to as a kid.The Bad Stuff (from worst to least worst)1.) The comedy in this movie was clearly designed much more for kids when compared to the first Kung Fu Panda movie, and especially when compared to the 2nd movie. The jokes definitely work sometimes, but its mostly bland slapstick.2.) Besides his theme, the main antagonist is mostly forgettable, which is sad when you think back to how great Lord Shen from Kung Fu Panda 2 was. Overall just a safe and uninspired villain.3.) The Panda's introduced in the movie were also all pretty forgettable. Though it is hard to compete when you have the Furious 5, Shifu, and Oogway already.Overall this movie continues down the same path as the previous 2 movies. Po must find something within himself, and use it to overcome the bad guy. It amps up the visuals and soundtrack, but lacks in the new characters and comedy."
" Kung Fu 3 Review
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,10,"Po (Jack Black) has been reunited with his long-lost father Li (Bryan Cranston) - but their cheery reconcilation is interrupted by the fiendish Kai (J. K. Simmons), a demonic warrior who is determined to take down all the kung fu masters...
If the closing words are to be believed then this will be ""The End"" for Po the panda, and if so it's a grand farewell. Directed by the second film's Jennifer Yuh Nelson, along with Alessandro Carloni, part three doesn't simply repeat the themes of the previous two but expands them, while maintaining a high hit-rate on laughs and gorgeous production design.
Po (Jack Black) has been tracked down by his long-last father (Bryan Cranston), which would be great news if it weren't for the god-like warrior who has come from the spirit realm to destroy every kung fu master. So it falls to Po, who is still a bit dubious about being the Dragon Warrior, to learn who he can be and, in his relationship with his dad, find out where he came from. And we all get a chirpy lesson in the philosophy of ch'i, which is something to do with plants and closing your eyes.Although there are now multiple characters on screen, and a big expensive pile of household names voicing them, everyone gets something worthwhile to do. There's confidence in the storytelling, which is swift and cheerful without the darkness of the last film, that allows for silly incidental comedy moments. By now the team has a great handle on the absurdity of the whole thing. Where else will you get to see a kung fu-fighting chicken or a panda dressed as a warrior dolphin?"
" I feel that this one is too rushed
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,6,"I feel that this one is too rushed, so it seems very hasty to start, carry and turn. The new characters are particularly impressed. The new female panda blurs the relationship with the tiger. The whole scene is like entering the Wow documentary: the mist of Pandalia"
" An intersting film for entertainment
",2018-12-31 00:00:00,7,"There are plenty good reviews about this film, so I am going to be fast.Kung Fu Panda 3 is a film, like the others, in wich you are not gonna find something special. It just the typical story about a hero but recovered with the occidental vision of the ""oriental culture"". So the only point needs to be to see this film to get some fun and enjoy the characters wich are the best of the film."
" Solid Trilogy
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,9,"No sure how they can make 3 consecutive marvelous movies like these but they did. Not even Toy Story is on the same level because Toy Story 2 was just an okay movie, Toy story 3 had good moments that's about it. And the Lion King movies...well lets say they should have stopped at 1. Shrek is nothing.KFP3 just a marvelous non-rushed movie, like all 3 it has a deep meaning that only the spiritual inclined can understand.Great trilogy and I can't wait for the 4th installment if they should continue."
" Still Holds Strong For the Younger Viewers
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,7,"This third installment is under the direction of newcomer director Alessandro Carloni and Jennifer Yuh Nelson. After a five year sabbatical, the film is voiced by the cesspool of talented performers including Jack Black, Bryan Cranston, Dustin Hoffman, J.K. Simmons, Angelina Jolie,and Kate Hudson among others. Continuing his efforts into his ""legendary adventures of awesomeness"", Po (Black) truly has his work cut out for him. There are two threatening burdens that come his way. The first being something from the outer world and then there's something more closer and personal. The main thing on a lot of people's mind is does this movie truly hold up? Or is this movie just an excuse to put a hole in your wallet?No question this film was to lure in the profits from us poor suckers since Dreamworks has been struggling financially, so they have taken their more successful film franchises and made sequels out them. But was ""Kung-Fu Panda 3"" a necessary one? Not exactly needed, but it was still enjoyable that had a lot of heart put into and carried a positive message to boot. And sure it's saturated with cliches that you see in today's animation world, but as long as the kids are having fun, that's really all that counts the most.Until they had taken their direction to the Panda Village, I was feeling a little bored with the story. The pacing was slow and the situation was quite eccentric. It was one of those off to a rocky beginning, but got better in the latter second half. And sure this film depends heavily on unoriginal formulaic plot devices that has been done to death a million times before, the structure still has a mass appeal that does justice for Dreamworks so no blame to them for not trying. The whole message about being the best you, you could possibly be is quite satisfying for the kids watching this. It was warming in the heart when the main protagonists were telling Po that it was him who made these characters who thay are and what they stand for that really lifted my spirits even though their quips were pretty hilarious in exchange. The script was almost flawless that there was very little to complain about and the story's flow goes by in a nice immaculate package. I would have a legitimate beef if a forth installment comes into works. By then it would truly wear out its welcome. Under all the sugary sweetness there were moments where the inner kid in me had a barrel of laughs knowing all the pandas that were in the village and besides pandas are both funny and cute to look at. But it's still deducts points for being unoriginal and a weak beginning.Granted the animation is the strongest quality about the film that makes it so extraordinary. And sure we can see that this movie was just a generic colourful template of vibrant colours and eye-candy effects, this film has animation that stands on its own merits. It's quite refreshing that at times it can showcase both styles of animation from the old school 2D animation to the more modern 3D. In this day and age I thought it was a relief that people and animators can still remember the 2D format and it was utilized to great effect especially the backdrops. The characters are well fleshed out and the baby pandas were so adorable you just want to take one home and adopt one.When it comes to the voice-acting in most part it was well executed. Jack Black truly stands out as Po and never loses his step or his enthusiasm in making the character his own.I felt that Angelina Jolie didn't have much to voice over here and in the first half of the movie her character was quite non-existent. J.K. Simmons stood out as the villain character and I think that after his Oscar win ""Whiplash"", it will be hard for him to break out of typecast. I was a bit letdown that Rebel Wilson had a no-show for character because the character she plays was customized for her to play. Nothing personal to Kate Hudson, but as Wilson's replacement she's just badly miscast.In the end, we see a beautifully crafted animated sequel that was not necessarily needed but an effective warm story though it has been done before better or worse. Sure it was made for the milking in the money, but still forgiven because it got better if you get past the murky opening scenes. The voice acting was superb especially from Jack Black, but the absence of Rebel Wilson was a bit of a downer. The kids and parents will truly have a ball and when all's said and done that's all that matters most."
" Don't judge a sequel by its first part.
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,3,"I was hoping for a lot and expected a lot and above all a lot of fantasizing but unfortunately we arrived at the same point as at the beginning of the movies.
it's practically the first part again just this time it makes less sense because of what we have experienced so far so many characters are suffering from flanderization.
Almost all characters have become more stupid and can not notice the simplest connections and it does not matter if that is just funny it's just not tolerable for this movie.
But what I find most sad is this film has neither heart nor mind.The ideas that appear in this movie just do not fit the concept we saw before and everything is so stupid and so ""... I just saw that"" I did not felled anything the whole time, I just waited until it was over. After I did not felt as if I had seen a movie but as if just a fast train had passed me by.
I did not even really felt that I saw a movie but that just just gave me access to it. The villain ""Kai"" is pretty generic and interchangeable his Kratos weapons have some cool abilities but that's the end of everything positive about him.A secret panda village where the pandas are withdrawn and sheltered from all other people's life is actually a nice idea but sadly destroyed is both the world building and the dangers that were built up with the last two movies.
the character design is quite uninspired and repetitive so I am sorry for all voice actor and animators because you can clearly see and hear that effort has been made.And with all the fat, stupid, constantly eating pandas, we get the stupid idiotic children's movie that I expected when I first heard about ""Kung Fu Panda"".
I do not know what to think of the film of which I thought he is super dumb was super cool and the film of which I thought he is super cool what super dumb.
At least I can say that these films surprised me from start to finish and that I definitely have to be more careful."
" 10 stars
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,10,"As a fan of funny animations I should say Kung Fu Panda series is one of the best series because it shows that if you want to be a hero, you can if you want to do anything, you can and just you have to try over and over. Moreover it's a really fun and you can have a great time when you watch it especially when you watch it with your family."
" With beautiful visuals, good comedy, thrilling action, and nice heritage lessons, Kung Fu Panda 3 is a worthy addition to the franchise
",2018-06-06 00:00:00,9,"In 2008, DreamWorks Animation attempted to make an animal wuxia martial arts action comedy with more focus on story and character development. That movie was Kung Fu Panda, the story about Po, an overweight fanboy who gets chosen as the Dragon Warrior improbably by Master Oogway to defend the Valley of Peace from Tai Lung. The Furious Five and Master Shifu doubted him at first and tried to kick him out, but Po managed to embrace himself and defeated Tai Lung. The movie was well-recieved both critcally and financially in USA and China and launched a new franchise for DreamWorks.Three years later, Kung Fu Panda 2 came out, continuing the story from the first by exploring Po's origins and having him fight against Lord Shen, an evil peacock, who had a connection to the panda. It dealt with themes such as genocide and adoption which gave the film a much darker tone. Despite it's underperformance domestically due to it's competition with The Hangover Part II on the same year, it did better in China and other countries and was also well-recieved by critics and audiences. Later, a tv show called ""Legends of Awesomeness"" arrived and despite receiving mixed reviews, it lasted for three seasons.With the first two films being critically acclaimed hits, a third film was in the works and later, in 2016, Kung Fu Panda 3 arrived. It continues where the second film left off with Po having a hard time taking the role of teacher after Master Shifu retires. Later, Po's biological father, Li Shan, finds him and reunites with him. Meanwhile, an adversary of Master Oogway named Kai plots to take the chi of all the kung fu masters. Po has to master chi and save the world once again while trying to learn more about his true heritage.Now, this review is based on my perspective of the film itself. I understand that it's considered by many to be the weakest of the franchise and prefered the first two better, but coming across as a fan who loved those films and other DreamWorks Animation films as well, I think that this was not only as good as the first two, but also an underrated film from 2016. Yes, I'll admit, it's not a perfect film and again, I understand why it's considered to be the weakest, but as a third entry of a very successful franchise, it's a solid continuation.Before I give this film some praise, there are some problems that could've been fixed, starting with the tone. There are some funny moments that were amusing, but the first two films were mature and balanced the drama with the comedy, whereas in this one, the rest of the silliness jars with the tense moments, which makes the tone very uneven. Next is the villain Kai voiced by J.K. Simmons. Now, to be fair, J.K. Simmons did a superb job with his vocal performance with a mix of funny and threatening and the action sequences involving him are amazing to watch, but his sympathetic detail was lacking in comparision to Tai Lung and Lord Shen, which had plenty of detail and made them very engaging and relatable. Not a terrible villain, mind you, but could've been so much better.And last but not least, the development of Furious Five and Master Shifu. Now we all now in the first film, Shifu had a connection to Tai Lung which really fleshed out his character and while he had little to do in the second film, at least he decided to help Po and the others in the climax. Unfortunately, he seemed to be underused here, and The Furious Five are once again underdeveloped, which is the same problem I had with the first film. Now, people can argue that they weren't given much to do in the second film, but at least they contributed more to the plot. Here, they even have less screentime. Only Tigress was the least wasted and the subplot revolving her and the little panda was cute, but unfortunately, her role was very minor compared to the second film, which gave her vulnerability especially when she comforted Po after he told her about his connection to Lord Shen. It would've been better if she and the other Furious Five members went with Po and his biological father so they can interact with the pandas. If DreamWorks Animation makes a fourth film, they better put them back into action.That's it for my problems and again, this is based on my perspective. Now, here are my praises for the film.Yes, the story does have too much siliness and it lacks the maturity of the last two, but it does a fine job answering the question fans have asked since the second film ended: Will Po finally meet his biological father?. Also, it balances the drama with the comedy well and gives plenty of heart to the film particularly to a scene where Li Shan mentions Po's deceased mom and that makes for a very tear-jerking moment. It also does a nice job continuing the progression of Po's character growth how he's going from student to master. Even the interaction between Mr. Ping and Li Shan is well done and it doesn't go into the rivalry cliche.The action sequences, much like the last two films, are very exciting and thrilling with some solid choreography. And although I do miss John Powell, Hans Zimmer does a great job representing the themes he did for the last two films.The characters are still likeable as they were. Po is still a lovable panda who remains relatable as each film progresses, Mr. Ping continues to bring a heartwarming side when he interacts with Po and in a scene where he interacts with Li Shan. And while Shifu and the Furious Five didn't get much to do, they're fine just the way they are. Also, Li Shan brings heart and sincerity while some of the panda villagers are one note, they're cute and so is Mei Mei. And then there's the animation and sweet heavens above it's gorgeous. The backgrounds are lush especially the panda village which I absolutely appreciate the most and the character animation is superb with expressive details on their feeling and reactions. Other stuff including snow, sand, grass, and rocks are greatly detailed. Even the Spirit Realm is so beautiful to look at.Overall, Kung Fu Panda 3 isn't a masterpiece and yes there are some things that could've been fixed, but as a third movie, this deserves my recommendation. It's gorgeously animated, thrilling, heartwarming, and most of all, a solid addition to the franchise. Thumbs up! :)P.S. Happy 10th anniversary, Kung Fu Panda 1! June 6, 2018"
" Alireza.Akhlaghi.Official
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,6,"The third section of Kung Fu Panda, in level of preseries even somewhat stereotyped versions, was made in terms of visual charm.
The confrontation between evil force and good force with each other, and the evil that is always defeated, forms the trio of animation, but with a deeper look we find that the core of Kung Fu Panda is in fact the effect of the Chinese Kung Fu on all the different segments of the animal community.
Of course, the subject of bulk on these trio is ignored in the confrontation of Kung Fu characters, which goes some way towards parallel Kung Fu philosophy.
The mainstream Kung Fu Panda III is based on energy of the collective spirit and its impact, which is well known in shape of the animation.
Finding the father and community of the pandas is a kind of triple turning point in animation, so that Panda's character (pou) sought to find his own origins from the beginning.
The struggle in the spiritual world with the evil force that all the friends of Pou have captured, in a way different from the before series, together with the energy derived from the collecting spirit, depicted a different, more attractive, and more abstract, space for Kung Fu Panda.
Apart from the techniques of making this animation, the lovely characters associated with Poe, more than the previous two series, but as a supplement, the Pandas community was well replaced."
" Horrible!!
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,1,This movie was just awful. Terrible plot. Stupid characters. And all in all just a boring movie. The whole time I wanted to leave the room but I suffered through it! To not believe the hype!!
" Marvellous

" great

" A very epic and satisfying conclusion.
",2017-12-07 00:00:00,9,"There are two animation studios out there that know how to make their sequels better than the original movie. The first one is notably Pixar and the second in my opinion is DreamWorks. Most of the sequels they have done in their franchises notable their second movies have stunned me by how they improved upon their predecessors. ""Kung Fu Panda"" was no exception. The second film not only stepped up the comedy and action, but really succeeded in its drama. So when they announced a third movie, I was both eagerly excited and yet very nervous due to having bad memories of ""Shrek the Third."" I went in the feeling the same and left very satisfied. ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is easily the best out of the franchise as it does contain all of the elements that made the second film fantastic and builds to make a very satisfying conclusion to the series.The dragon warrior Po (Jack Black) has been given his final lesson by Mater Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) in this case learning the art of Chi so then he can take on his role as teacher of the Furious Five (Angelina Jolie, Lucy Liu, Jackie Chan, David Cross and Seth Rogan respectively). He realizes very quickly though that he is not a good teacher and tries to set out how he can find himself. During all the hubbub though, his biological father Li Shan (Bryan Cranston) finally reunites with his son and tells him of a secret panda village high above the mountains, much to the jealousy of Po's adopted father, Mr. Ping (James Hong). However, an evil yak from the spirit world named Kai (J.K. Simmons) returns to the mortal world and is out to destroy everything his former friend Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) had accomplished, notably taking away the Chi of the kung fu warriors he trained and turning them into jade zombies. Knowing he's near, Po must find out how to learn the art of Chi from the pandas and defeat Kai before all the warriors are captured.The story is certainly the best element of the film. It once again steps up the comedy, and drama of the second film (even showing us the saddest scene again) but what the film really stepped up is the action. Oh wow, is the action suspenseful. This was easily what the films were building up to. The battles in this film are just epic. They keep you on the edge of your seat and make you worried about the characters, though they still throw in some comedy to keep the laughs coming. The climatic battle at the end, which I dare not spoil, is honestly one of the best action scenes put in animated film ever. The animation is yet again beautiful. Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson succeeds once again at blending elements of 2D and 3D animation together perfectly and also creating some beautiful backgrounds. The spirit world in particular was just eye popping. I loved how the colors in the background looked. As for the characters, there once again great particularly the new ones. I really like Li Shan and the other pandas in the village. But by far, the character that really succeeded was Kai. What a fantastic villain! I never thought that he would be able to top Gary Oldman's devious character of Lord Shen but wow, J.K. Simmons knocked this character right out of the park. He's such a devious jerk of a villain yet he still has some comedy to him. He actually did have a very funny line during the final battle that really made me laugh. It's exactly what I expect. ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is yet another example of a great sequel with a fantastic story, beautiful animation and really good characters. This is a really good sequel. I'm pretty sure that DreamWorks will probably stop the series here because I seriously don't know how they will be able to top this. It's just a great sequel and certainly one I'll really remember."
" Monkey Voice Actor
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,9,"Jackie Chan was the voice actor for this movie but for some reason, his voice sound different from other kung fu panda movie. The voice actor from this movie sound almost like from the TV series by James Sie. The fight scene voice sound like jackie chan but other parts doesn't sound like it. Other parts sound like James Sie or other Asian voice actor."
" Kung Fu Panda 3 wasn't good.
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,7,"Nothing in this movie is funny at all. Po is a character, who was amazing, who makes dumb ""jokes"" throughout the whole movie. The character development is weak and the plot should have been more serious. The ""comedy"" in this film ruins the whole movie. The other movies in this series are better than this."
" It was never about the fighting
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,10,"As Tigress says to Po you cant win this with kicks and jabs, and so many reviewers failed to get the point. Ultimately this is about enlightenment and leaving the self behind. Po did not win in the spirit world by defeating his opponent but by giving him what he wanted.Sadly there is simply no straight line to gain enlightenment. It is rare to find people who can come to inhabit the universe like Po and experience the joy that involves.Po's teaching is to be the best ""you"" there is, and get over all the rest. It is sad that more people did not get the message. Frankly the ones who hate this the most reject the message, or they simply prefer the fighting even though it is really not the reason for the movie to exist.Peace"
" What can be given could also be taken
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,8,"Kung Fu panda is funny as always. you can watch these cartoon with family. There combines fight and jokes. I really love second part, so I decided to watch the third. And...I was disappointed. Yes, there was much jokes and fun.... But I love Kung Fu panda because of fight and dynamics.But jokes so excellent and pandas are so cute. However jokes must be free additional not more...Maybe I am too old for cartoons.Actially I love cartoons there are no violence, no vulgarity here. There are all the best here. And there was a magic. OK, not actually magic but chi.It gives great responsibility. You can destroy the world, or create new. It is dilemma. You can healing by giving someone your chi. Kai decided what can be given could also be taken. He decided to tale all chi too himself (it is mad, isn't it?). It was too much for him. Too much power can laid to die. Sometimes people forgot that great power is great responsibility.It must not be forgotten. I love visuals, especially in spirit reality.It is so real. There is so much gold (I love gold).So picturesque, so wonderful. and I really love music,it is so...fantasy. Hans Zimmer made great job. It is so full of life, battle, ...paphos. So I added three songs to my playlist.Coclusion:It is good cartoon for child and his families. It has excellent music and visuals. It has finny jokes. What also need for family watching?"
" The best of the movies so far...
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,6,"I must start by stating that ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is every bit as good as the previous two movies, and then some...This is without a doubt the best of the three story lines told so far, and it is also the movie that had the best jokes and comedies, at least in my opinion.And it is the concept of the story and the way that the story is told that makes it stand that much out in comparison to the previous two movies. There was just something more appealing to the storyline here; perhaps it was the fact that Po got to find other pandas and thus get closer to home.""Kung Fu Panda 3"" has some very nice animation work, just exactly like the previous two movies. And the characters in the movie are all memorable, outstanding, colorful and well-rounded.As an animated movie, voice acting is a crucial part and can often be a make it or break it kind of resolve. And the voice acting in ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" turned out to be good. And they have a very nice ensemble of actors and actresses on the list to do the voices for the colorful animated characters. It is great to see returning voice cast come to bring the characters to life on the screen, and I was especially impressed with Brian Cranston here in this third movie. And believe you me, that this franchise has some easily recognized voices on the list, and quite an impressive list that is.The art work and style is good as well, continuing in the established style of the previous two, so it is very easy to relate to the established character and world in which the move about.If you enjoyed the previous two ""Kung Fu Panda"" movies then you definitely will enjoy ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" as well. And it is quite worth the time and effort to do so.My rating of ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is a solid 6 out of 10 stars easily."
" Least favorite of the series
",2017-04-11 00:00:00,4,"This movie was probably my least favorite of the series. It was fun, but very distracting. It is obvious that the idea for Master Kai's weapons, were taken straight from the God of War video game series. Kai is in the Spirit World. And he has blades that can control the spirits of the masters he defeats. And the blades are attached to his wrists by a chain a mystical chain. While Kratos's Blades of Exile are not green and cant control spirits, they do attached to his wrist by a mystical chain. And cant be removed by himself. Much like Kai's. But the Claw of Hades (also from God of War) can control the spirits of the underworld, much like Master Kai's can control the chi orbs of the Masters that Kai has defeated. They just combined the two weapons into one. So they entire movie, I thought I was watching ""This Ain't God of War. Panda Edition""Wasn't the only thing wrong, but its what was most distracting."
" A lot of fun
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,8,"This is a great movie. Kids love it. It starts good, with a lot of fun,Poe finding out that he has a dead and a whole colonies of pandas. Poe struggling to learn the Che, Whole palad's get's destroyed, and at the end get's very emotional with Poe wining over a General Kay. It is Entertainment to the end. We watched it over 10 times at least :-)."
" Not bad at all
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,9,"I've seen the first two movie, that we're very good, maybe better then this. But i enjoy this too. The same comedic Jack Black, with the help of the other character converge to a good final. I liked the fact that there are many famous actors who played the roles very well and bring a welcome doze of comedy. Recommend it!"
" Good Fun Movie to Watch
",2017-03-03 00:00:00,8,"It is really hard to make good sequels after a famous first movie. Because there is less room for character development, villain seems predictable, and fun factor is usually less. I did not enjoy Kung Fu Panda 2 a lot and I feared that the movie will face a similar fate. But I have to inform that the movie is a good one, if not the best.I felt the story development was hurried, and the movie ended too quickly. I can also feel that prime target of this movie was kids who will not think a lot about some improbable emotional aspects which can be seen in the movie. You cannot take this movie too seriously.There were funny dialogues, also there were nice quotations like ""Sometimes we do wrong things for right reasons"". There were many instances in the movie when you would laugh. It is a nice film. Just do not think too deeply about the plot of the movie, as many things might not make too much sense to a mature mind. Hopefully, we will be exploring the Kung Fu Panda's world more in coming future."
" Naive and whimsical Po is still going strong
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,8,"Kung Fu Panda 3 is about what you would expect. A roller coaster ride of gags, goof ups and outrageous martial art outbursts.Po is himself, clumsy, naïve, martial arts master and funny. As usual he is accompanied by his friends from the previous movies including the somewhat reluctant Shifu. The wise turtle Oogway from the first Kung Fu Panda is back as well, kind of.Naturally there is a big bad villain, General Kai, who it turns out have some past relations to Oogway. General Kai is pretty good as a villain with a suitable maniacal expression on his face. Then of course, a bull in itself is already projecting bad temper and violence so it is a good start.The main story is of course about defeating General Kai but Po's reunification with his (real) father and the rest of the, funny and very clumsy, inhabitants in the Panda village is taking up a large part of the movie.In general the story is quite nice with some nice twists.It should come as no surprise that Po, as usual, saves the day in a cataclysmic showdown with General Kai. There are some great animation effects in the final battle.At the end of the day this is a quite recommendable family movie."
" Kung Fu Panda 3 is a really good movie and a good ending of the franchise
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,8,"I'm a lover of the Kung Fu Panda movies since i was 8 years old. The first one is a really great movie. In that moment, i couldn't see the movie in theaters because my parents were busy in that moment, so i saw on DVD. The second one I achieved see in the theater in 3D with my family and it was amazing. The best of the franchise. And when i heard about the third one and saw the trailers, i was really excited because they past 5 years after the last one. I also saw with my family in 3D, and i really enjoy it. First let's talk about the animation, that is probably the best one in the franchise. All the colors, the characters designs, the scenarios,the action scenes, everything is fantastic in the animation. The humor is effective and it got some hilarious moments. The voice cast is really well done with talent voices of Jack Black, Bryan Cranston, James Hong, J.K Simmons, Dustin Hoffman, Angelina Jolie and others makes the movie a really watchable time. The story is interesting and great to see a continuation of the second one in stated to reap it the same movie. The score of Hans Zimmer is beautiful as always and makes the action scenes and the emotional moments effective and fun. And the last good thing about the movie are the characters, they are really likable and they still being the same characters as we know it. My favorite character of the franchise is probably is Mr. Ping. Unfortunately, the movie has some defects. The biggest problem of the movie is that even is that funny, there are jokes that don't make me laugh like the testicle joke or when the same jokes of the movie are repeated, and sometimes make me think why they try to be the most funny movie of all like Shrek the Third did. Not even that the tone of the movie although it is not bad,it sometimes want to be Kung Fu Panda 1 for some of the jokes you have. And the last problem with the movie is its villain. Kai is not a very powerful or frighting villain like Lord Shen or Tai Long. It has some funny moments, the concept of the villain is really great, the design is fantastic and J.K. Simmons dose a great job, but his is the most weakest villain of the franchise. So yeah, this movie has been throwing by people calling the best of Kung Fu Panda series, the worst of the series or the weakest of the series. And yeah, I would lie if I said that this is the weakest one. But for the other hand, is better than Shrek the Third respect in the writing and humor. It's a shame that this couldn't have the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature because it could be great if Kung Fu Panda were the first trilogy in be nominated in that category. But, i think that the Kung Fu Panda franchise is the best franchise that Dreamworks give us. Kung Fu Panda 3 even is not the best one in the franchise is a really good sequel which knows that who to end and not be another shity franchise like Ice Age or The Land before Time. 8.9/10"
" Worthwhile, charming and visually-stunning.
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,7,"Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016) is worthwhile, charming, and visually-stunning. Personally, I have found the previous two entries in the series to be thoroughly entertaining. Yet again, this film proves to be tons of fun. It does not feel like a movie that is specifically pandering to kids, and in turn, will end up being enjoyable for the whole family. It also presents a genuinely positive message in an innocent-like manner. The action scenes are really fun and the quippy one-liners remain witty throughout. The voice cast does a decent job, with Jack Black once again being the driving factor. As for complaints, I would say that there are no shocks, twists, or anything that would implicate emotional investment. But hey, I really shouldn't be complaining about that kind of thing. It's Kung Fu Panda 3."
" Po stays lovable yet again
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,7,"Three installments in, the novelty of Jack Black voicing a clumsy, dopey and constantly awe-stricken warrior panda who overcomes all his obvious deficiencies has worn thin. That's a fact of any franchise that leans on the same conceit over and over. Still, there's something eternally lovable about Po the ""Dragon Warrior"" that makes ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" more enjoyable (or easier to stomach) than most of its animation franchise contemporaries.Although it's four and a half years later, the same creative team behind ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" returns for the three-quel, assuring a level of quality in the animation and storytelling. Director Jennifer Yuh Nelson brought a greater degree of visual splendor to ""2,"" and in tandem with longtime DreamWorks animator and story artist Alessandro Carloni, ""3"" has comparably engaging visuals and kinetic energy.Writers Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger have been the mainstays of Po's adventures since the beginning. Although they didn't conceive the original 2008 story, they've scripted all three films alone, something that rarely can be said about animated films. They demonstrate in this latest chapter how well they know the hallmarks of the franchise they helped create and what the essential storytelling components are. In this adventure, the valley comes under attack by Kai (J.K. Simmons), a warrior bull that had been trapped in the spirit realm by Master Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) – the wise turtle master of the previous films – for hundreds of years. Kai has mastered the ability to steal the chi of all things spirit and living, and stealing Oogway's chi has given him the strength to cross over. Now, Po must quickly master the mystical power of chi if there's any hope of stopping Kai.Although the problems and conflicts of all the films have been episodic, ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" completes the circle of Po's character arc. Po must constantly rise to the occasion despite improbable expectations being placed on his shoulders every time, and this film seems to complete his journey as Dragon Warrior. This thread gives the franchise a continuity that matters. Every lesson could be totally different in each film, but, as purveyors of children's content, the DreamWorks team behind these films recognizes the importance of reinforcement. All of Po's adventures tie back to the same ideas in different ways.The film also wraps up the mystery of Po's parentage as we quickly meet his birth father, Li (Bryan Cranston), who tells him pandas were the old masters of Chi and he can learn if he comes with him to the secret panda village where a host of new characters await. This is not good news as far as Po's adoptive father, Mr. Ping (James Hong), is concerned, and the film explores some challenging family dynamics in a sensitive way.The same kinds of jokes and slapstick from the previous movies persist in ""Kung Fu Panda 3,"" but they're not noticeably flatter than they were the last time. The same plot devices have been recycled, but they're no less engaging than they were the last time either. The same lessons can be learned from this film as the last couple times, but they're no less meaningful. All this to say ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" is a ""meets expectations"" sequel, and as the third movie in a franchise eight years running, ""meets expectations"" is a compliment.~Steven CThanks for reading!

" Great to have my name in the credits
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,9,"If you only do what you can, you will never be more than you are now. Its an honor to work for a movie as great as KFP3. DreamWorks did an awesome job. Must watch movie. Best animation till date. Kung Fu Panda has always been my favorite franchise of all time. Looking forward for a 4th edition of this epic Title, As master Shifu says, Time is just an illusion, there is only the now. Talking about the villain, Kai has return! I guess Kai was the best ever character villain. Way to go Dreamworks!!! Love the Po character given to me as a souvenir for working on this. As Po says, Listen closely because I'm only going to repeat this ten times."
