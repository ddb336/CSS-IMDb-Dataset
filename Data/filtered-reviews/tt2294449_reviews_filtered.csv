" Just as Fun as the Original
",2021-02-17 00:00:00,9,"22 Jump Street series is a nice addition to the Jump Street universe, a self aware sequel that moves the Narcs onto the horrors of University. Although not as realistic or as entertaining as the first movie's setting (though Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill did not remotely resemble even 22 year olds in high school) it was more funny and the college setting was more extravagant in a self aware way so much that the Korean Church police headquarters becomes better and Ice Cube says that it is due to a higher budget. The action wasn't as fun as the first film but in terms of the ending man the helicopter ride the Mexican setting everything was pitch perfect there was even a certain car that is worth seeing. Overall it's a worthy sequel to the satiric and fun first film, another 112 minutes of entertainment make sure to watch and pay attention because 22 Jump Street is another great addition to the buddy cop film genre."
" Just made the mark
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,7,"The first one was so good it was going to be hard to top it. It has some funny moments, but I will always watch the first one more than this one."
" Forgotten But Not Gone
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,4,"Well, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have been promoted. Instead of going undercover at a high school - yet again - to break up drug rings, they are going undercover at a college to break up drug rings. Otherwise, it's the same old same old, with lame, self-referential jokes, sexual situations and a lot of guns.The tv series this was based on was the launch pad for Johnny Depp's career. It was intended as a variation on The Mod Squad. Initial excitement slid quickly, and it left the network after three seasons. Hollywood, however, not only can't leave a classic property alone, but must beat it to death, they also do it with lesser works, a movie revival in 2012 was successful enough to warrant a sequel. It hasn't been heard from since,"
" A sequence well done and more fun than the first!
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,8,"It is one of the few things that happen in Hollywood, when the sequence is better than the original. The film is funnier and more fun than the predecessor with the actors on autopilot, but even more at ease in their roles."
" Amazing
",2021-01-11 00:00:00,9,"This movie is great ,but definitely not better than 21 jump street."
" Awesome sequel
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,8,"Held its own to the original. A couple corny parts, but very funny and worth it"
" Just as hilarious
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,8,"Fans of 21 Jump Street will not be disappointed at all in 22 Jump Street, which is really rare for a sequel. It's every bit as funny as the original, and everyone still seems like they're having a blast while making it. Even though it's a light comedy, it still manages to draw you in and surprise you. I won't go so far as claim there are dramatic moments, but it is realistic and sweet even though it's silly.As the end of the first movie promised, undercover agents Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill go to college for their next assignment. Sent to find the dealer of a new on-campus intense drug ""WhyPhy,"" they soon split off in different directions. Tatum joins a fraternity and the football team, and Hill falls for a beautiful art major (Amber Stevens West) he meets at a poetry slam. Taking different paths takes a toll on their friendship, and the bickering ""couple"" makes us laugh during every minute. As we follow both hapless agents searching without any leads, their boss Ice Cube gets just as hilariously frustrated as he did in the first movie.Keep your eyes open for Peter Stormare, Nick Offerman, Queen Latifah, and repeat performances from Rob Riggle and Dave Franco. The very modern humor might not please your parents who watched the original television series, but the younger crowd will laugh themselves silly."
" Self-Aware, Satirical, And Exactly the Same
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,8,"Schmidt and Jenko are back to fulfil the promise at the end of the first movie; that they'd next be going to college. It turns out this meant online courses in order to intercept smuggling codes, but it's not long until the promise of watching Schmidt and Jenko navigate actual college is met. They're on the case of another new drug running rampant across the campus called WHYPHY; Work Hard? Yes. Play Hard? Yes. (probably the cleverest name for a drug I've ever heard), which has already claimed the life of a young student. Their bromance is tested, they get wrapped up in frat initiations and extracurricular activities, and experience every facet of college living, before the final showdown during spring break.22 Jump Street is a sequel that knows it's a sequel, and takes every opportunity to let you know that it knows. A large portion of the humour revolves around this self-awareness, pointing out how everything's going to be exactly the same as the first time, or jokingly teasing a third movie (and beyond). But there are other packets of humour around as well, including the return of digging into them over their age, likening their professional partnership to a romantic coupling, and of course a wealth of references and homages to other slices of pop culture, including Tatum's role in White House Down, Hill's role as a surrogate Seth Rogan in Superbad, Benny Hill, NWA and Ice Cube's career, Batman's choice of transportation etc etc. Clear comedy highlights for me included Channing Tatum's complete dedication to Jenko's penny drop moment in the office, the end credits full of posters and teasers for fake sequels, and the awkward kiss fight between Schmidt and Mercedes. In all three cases, the skits go on for just as long as they need to, pushing the boundaries of what might be considered too long, but remaining funny enough throughout that you only crave more once they finish.And honestly that's there really is to say about this movie. It's nose-snortingly laugh-out-loud hilarious from beginning to end. It's remarkably clever and self-aware, and never outstays its welcome. It even shows some flashes of cinematic brilliance such as the tripping scene, but of course it's a shallow movie that's just fine for how shallow it is. There's a joke or a reference every minute so it's easy to miss a bunch just through sheer laughter. I give it a solid 8/10, especially for a comedy."
" Surprisingly a brilliant sequel!!
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,8,22 Jump Street is a sequel to the 2012 film 21 Jump Street. The plot follows the two police officers that go undercover at a college in order to find the supplier of a new drug. There is not many good sequels to films but this is excellent. Surprisingly it was brilliant and very enjoyable to watch. It's certainly is worth watching.
" The first movie scrapes a pass mark but this sequel falls well short
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,4,"21 Jump Street's main appeal was the lead performances from Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, but they aren't able to salvage this lazy rewrite which quickly becomes tiresome and childish."
" ""It's...literally... the... same""
",2020-08-27 00:00:00,8,"And somehow it isn't at the same time. Well, it is. The movie smartly plays with how unnecessary and repetitive this sequel is, and with that, gives us enough meta jokes to enjoy the same kind of trip.In the end though, it's hard to argue this isn't just the same thing over again, and the good thing about that is they put the same effort on it, so it is as good.The difference for me is that while is not as good in the first two acts, while their were the best parts of the original, it gets even more absurd in the final act (which is hard to do, considering how absurd the final act of the original was), making it absolutely insane and funnier still. Plus, the end credits are awesome too, completing a really satisfying sequel and ending of a good short lived revival of a franchise."
" Diplooooo
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,7,Great soundtrack and Diplooo. Also original tracks from Ice Cube and a surprise appearance from Seth Rogan
" Identical storyline, different setting!
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,7,"Just like the first film, it's funny straight from the get go with an interesting opening, that interesting part of it became a meme.From the start the film follows a similar story line to the first however with a different setting and characters switched around.During the film there is tons of easter eggs to be spotted such as a possible third film coming and ice cubes office being referred to as an ice cube. Alongside the easter eggs the the action sequences are great and fast paced, but not so fast that you can't enjoy the action and understand it.The ending is great with a interesting build up to the end."
" Fresh and funny
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,8,This film continues the raunchy humour of the first film which I really enjoyed. This time it really expands on the storyline so it is very fresh. The actors are great in their comedy. It has some lighthearted poking at its own sequel status.
" Copy and Paste.
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,2,Exact same as first movie same story same everything. Really unfunny and one dimensional lame characters. Movie lacks any real humor or any depth or substance. The humor is really forced and comes off as extremely corny and cringy. That fact that this movie is rated a 7 is a joke.
" Actually liked it better than 21 Jump Street
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,8,Normally sequels suck. It's hard for moviemakers to capture the original spirit that captivates audiences the first time around.This ain't that type of movie.22 Jump Street does what the original one did and surpasses it in some areas. Not to mention that it continues to poke fun at itself while taking it to extremes in certain areas.Great film for those seeking some adult humor mixed in with action.4/5. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum do it again.
" Writers were too lazy!
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,4,"It's 21 jump street but in college, same plot with same conflicts
I didn't laugh but twice, It wasn't totally boring but It was a useless movie"
" An overall improvement
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,7,"'22 Jump Street' is an overall improvement on '21 Jump Street'. However, it kinda levelled out by the end.Its predecessor started slowly but got better as it finished, whereas 22JS does the opposite. Terrific beginning which gave laughs, though it lost its way a little by the conclusion. This one has an excellent initial closing credits, one of the funniest I've seen."
" These two b**ches went to college!
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,9,"I LOVED this movie. As good or better than the original, which is so rare I can't remember the last time someone achieved that. Obviously, this is silly escapism humor so I think you have to view it in that light, but the movie never aims to be more than goofy laughs with some bromance mixed in.22 successfully sets up a plot that engages while taking every opportunity to poke fun at itself and multiple movie genres, much like the first one did. It might help if you are familiar with some pop culture, as the movie is filled to bursting with quick little Easter eggs and references that are 'blink and miss it' types.It also revels in taking movie cliches and flipping them on their head for yuks, like a ""fight"" scene where Jonah Hill's character Schmidt is intensely uncomfortable when one of the villains repeatedly believes the fight is about to degenerate into a sexy Mr. and Mrs. Smith battle-to-bedroom make out session or when Channing Tatum's Jenko drops his Q-Tip into another guy's meat sandwich and they gleefully declare that they are sharing a ""meat-qute,"" a term for the scene in romantic comedies when the couple to be first meet each other in a cute and humorous way.The movie never takes itself seriously, constantly making fun of itself, the previous movie, or other works the cast have been in; the last ten minutes of run time are devoted to absurd ideas for the next few hundred incarnations of the series, all but slamming the door on the idea of making any more while still managing to be suspiciously reminiscent of other series that didn't know when to quit.I was never a fan of the original show, so I watched '21 Jump Street' reluctantly only to be pleasantly surprised at how fresh they managed to make the idea feel. '22' admirably carried on the tradition, building a light hour and a half around the two charismatic leads that didn't overstay its welcome and left me in a good mood."

",2019-08-15 00:00:00,1,The sequel proves that stupidity comes in abundance...
" Not as funny as the first
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,6,The first film 21 jump street is brilliant this is average. It's more or less the same kind of jokes with a plot that's not so good. Channing Tatum isn't funny and neither is his blonde football friend. Schmid's girlfriend isn't really interesting and it doesn't go anywhere. They should do the men in black crossover because that would be a lot better than the new one
" Above Average: 6.0
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,6,"Comedy sequels are unusual beasts: on one hand, they have to be about as funny as their predecessors, enough to justify their existence. But on the other, if the humor strays too far from the original, it gets harder to call it a sequel. Such is the dilemma faced by 22 Jump Street. Seeing its huge box office haul, it's probable that those who wished to see it have done so already. However, for those who haven't, you'll get almost as much enjoyment from watching the first one again. Yes, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are still a great class act, and there are plenty of great comedic moments. But too many of those moments are recycled, and starting to get a bit stale. In this regard, the film is funnier than it perhaps should be, but this is barely enough to keep it afloat."
" it's inking in my mouth
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,9,"Hysterical. just as good as the first one. never dull, constantly entertaining. I love that it made fun of itself a bunch of times, and also sometimes being a parody of other movies and their sequels. so much of the comedy is clever and smart. the writers know what we like. this is my kind of comedy. great musical score once again (5 viewings, 2/20/2020)"
" Hilarious!
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,8,"Just when you think sequels are all about doing the same with a bigger budget... well ... along comes 22 Jump Street. As funny as the first, if not better in many parts. You may have to be of a certain age to appreciate the ice cube references, but this duo will undoubtedly give you the gigs!"

" 5 Conglomerates Control 90% US an Europe Commercial Media Results In?
",2019-04-03 00:00:00,1,"I read through quite a few reviews to see if anyone else got the joke. This movie made a couple of hundred million profit. Sequels don't have a great reputation. How good could the word of mouth have been? Instead of the audience laughing at the movie, the movie laughs at the audience. No it isn't the first time. But now they don't hide it."
" Usually I hate movies in this feild. But these movies are FUNNY
",2019-03-20 00:00:00,8,"I will mention that the humor in these movies are dumb, but thats expected! If you go into this movie expecting a dumb and funny movie then you wont be disappointed. And props to them for not using naked woman to sell this movie (like so many other (comedies do)."

" there are too many discussions about friendship that seem to have nothing to do with the main line of the plot
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,6,"Compared with the first one, there are too many discussions about friendship that seem to have nothing to do with the main line of the plot. Causes the plot to push sometimes slowly and sometimes abruptly. Then the funny intensity is not enough, the lower limit is too high."
" Even better than the first
",2019-02-12 00:00:00,7,"Hollywood demands sequels. But this is one that literally bites from the hand that feeds, making fun of the fact that it treads the same ground with minor changes and inversions. It's also just as funny as the last one, taking the ridiculous notion of bringing 21 Jump Street into modern times and succeeding in spite of such a dumb concept.Two years later, (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are back on the streets and after drug dealers led by Ghost (Peter Stormare). After failing spectacularly, they're dropped back into Captain Dickson's (Ice Cube) program, which has moved across the street to 22 Jump Street.Now, Jenko is the popular one becoming friends with the jocks like Zook (Wyatt Russell, son of Kurt and Goldie Hawn) and Rooster (YouTube actor Jimmy Tatro). Schmidt hooks up with Maya, who ends up being Ice Cube's daughter and hijinks, of course, ensue.The supporting cast makes this one, from Nick Offerman, Rob Riggle and Dave Franco returning from the last film to appearances by Queen Latifah, Jillian Bell, Bill Hader, Anna Faris, Seth Rogan, H. Jon Benjamin and Patton Oswalt. There are also appearances by nearly every actor from the 21 Jump Street series that didn't make it into the last film.Finally, the end credits spoil tons of sequels that are coming to this movie. Sadly, one of the real sequel ideas - MIB23, which would combine 21 Jump Street and the Men in Black series into one movie - has never come to pass."
" Great sequal
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,7,After the first film you would think that making a second could spoil the franchise but there are so many funny moments and it really holds its own a definite good movie to watch
" As silly and funny as the first one
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,7,I wouldn't say it's better than the first one like most critics seem to think but it's as good. There are some very funny moments but I admit the part that really got me laughing was the awesome ending credits sequence.
" The humor is crude and predictable
",2018-10-31 00:00:00,5,"I like that 22 Jump Street is very aware that it is a sequel, but I didn't find this one to be as funny as the first one. The constant stream of improvised moments dialogue makes the humor almost predictable. And it's much more vulgar than it needed to be. The end credits sequence is hilarious, though. It's almost worth watching just because of that."
" Self-awareness only takes this sequel so far
",2018-10-15 00:00:00,7,"Very early on in ""22 Jump Street"", the guys are basically told to do the same thing as the last time since that's their best chance for success. While it's nice to see the screenwriters basically admitting that they're following the template of the first movie, it still leaves us with a sequel that's more or less trying to recreate the success of its predecessor. On one hand, using the same framework opens the door to variations but, at the same time, it's hard to avoid a sense of 'been there, done that'. Then again, the entire premise of the series is inherently limited, so there's only so much that you can do with it.After going undercover at a high school in the first movie, the duo take the next logical step and go undercover at a college. Once again trying to infiltrate a drug ring, the story obviously feels similar to the first movie. Where the differences lie is mainly in the interactions between Jenko & Schmidt. This time around, Jenko is the one who fits in better, which ultimately creates friction between the two. In the end, I'm not sure that the story is different enough from the first movie but it should please fans looking for more of the same. Probably the only area where the movie improved upon its predecessor was in the action department.As for the cast, Channing Tatum & Jonah Hill are of course back again and they're just as good together as they were the first time around. Ice Cube & Nick Offerman make welcome return appearances as well. Joining them is the always reliable Peter Stormare as the requisite bad guy along with Jillian Bell, Amber Stevens West & Wyatt Russell. Not a bad group but probably not quite up to the standard of the first movie. There is, however, a nice surprise appearance by Queen Latifah.In terms of production values, the movie can't be faulted. With the original directors returning, the quality didn't dip as is often the case with sequels. In fact, a larger budget enabled them to add more spectacle to the mix and they were able to accomplish this without overshadowing the movie's comedic core.Even though I enjoyed the movie I was nevertheless left with a feeling that it wasn't entirely necessary. I appreciate the self-aware approach to producing a sequel but, in the end, the result was still fairly formulaic and predictable in spite of that. While the excellent end credits sequence just about single-handedly justified the existence of the movie, I'm not sure what it says about a movie when the end credits is the best part."

" Maintains A Top Standard

I can't lie, I enjoyed the film, especially the ending when Jonah Hill ""returns the favor.""After taking orders from their yin-yang, they make the same film.Yes, they made the same movie twice. The humor was silly, inane, yet at the same time clever such as a silly chase scene taking place in front of ""The Benjamin Hill Center for Film Studies."" Anyone not hip to Benny Hill, might miss the real joke looking at a chase scene that is otherwise unappealing.At one point our undercover guys act like a couple breaking up ""Maybe we should start investigating other people."" Tatum has met a meat head football player who thinks identical to him, leaving Jonah Hill as the third wheel.The film had a number of good one liners, such as ""I don't know if I like you sober."" The scenes worked fairly well, building upon each other.Parental Guide: Plenty of F-bombs. No sex or nudity."
" a self aware sequel
",2018-05-24 00:00:00,7,"22 jump street knows what it is and takes advantage of it, it knows that it's a sequel to a movie that is a remake to a stupid tv show, it makes fun of cop movies and subvert the cliches of cop movies and makes fun of 21 jump street and make fun of sequels, there times where the jokes that are a bit draggy, theres is character that just have one joke and it gets bit annoying, overall I thank it's a very funny movie, it has good action and great jokes, also i recommend watching 21 jump street first because you wouldn't get some of the jokes."
" FUNNY AF
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,9,This film made me laugh several times. It was so funny. If you love laughing then i recommend this film. If you like channing tatum then I recommend this film. Also if you like Jonah hill then I recommend this film.
" 22 Jump Street is not as good as its predecessor, but it's ever so close!
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,6,"This was SO much fun to watch. Screw writing a review, the soundtrack just makes me want to throw a party right now. Seriously downloading that shizz immediately. In this sequel our abysmal police officers are sent to 22 Jump Street (a much better title than 21 Jump Street 2) to go undercover in a college to bust...you guessed it, another drug dealer. This drug is called ""why-phy"" and makes you ultra focussed before sending your mind down one heck of a trippy trip. That scene alone, was just a beauty to behold. Channing Tatum dancing in a rainbow land, adjacent to Jonah Hill listening to hellish rock music. Majestic. That obviously conveys the contrast between them and they do go down a rather formulaic personality clash only for them to regroup to try and save the day! That's my biggest problem with the film, it's far too formulaic and is pretty much a rehash of its predecessor. I get it, don't fix what is not broken but with a bigger budget this was more unfocused. In fact I don't think anyone cared for the actual plot this time. What this did do though, was pull a damn good twist in the middle which I did NOT see coming. One of those moments where I shouted ""Oh. My. God. Nooo no no noooo!"". If you've seen the film, you know what I mean (hint: involves parents visiting the college). The script was self-referential and clearly used this awareness to poke fun out of itself, which was a smart move. The end credits showed that hilariously. Best end credits scene I've seen in a looooong time. Jonah Hill was occasionally good but again, I just don't like him. Channing Tatum was not as consistent with his line delivery, some of them fell flat. The action scenes were well filmed and had some flamboyancy to them which made the experience all the more enjoyable. That's exactly what this is, a damn good enjoyable flick with some hysterical scenes...and a kickass soundtrack which I'm downloading right now. No joke, turning my laptop on now."
" Not as good as the first but still an entertaining and smart comedy with some great sequel satire.
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,8,"Most of the comedy in '22 Jump Street (2014)' comes from some stellar sequel satirisation, with its incredibly smart meta-textual commentary feeling like it does much more than just 'hang a lantern' on the numerous issues it calls out. Though some of these issues do plague the piece due to its follow-up nature, they're always made a part of the joke and are never truly detrimental. The flick isn't as good as the first (though, it's close) mainly because it is so similar to it and doesn't quite have as strong a handle on its characters or narrative. Still, it's a highly entertaining and amazingly funny flick that will surely keep you smiling throughout. 8/10"
" Pretty Good Follow-Up!
",2018-02-10 00:00:00,6,"Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Wyatt Russell and Ice Cube star in this 2014 action-comedy sequel based on the TV series. This picks up where the last film ended with cops, Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) sent undercover at a local college to find a drug supplier. In the process, they begin to question their partnership and make new friends. Russell plays Zook, a football jock who befriends Jenko and Cube returns as Captain Dickson. This is a pretty good follow-up I liked better than the first and Hill & Tatum are great together. I recommend this."
" Great sequel with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and plenty of charisma to boot
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Is '22 Jump Street' as good as '21 Jump Street'? Quite possibly, which is a big achievement, seeing as the original was one of the better comedies of the last 10 years! This film has just as many laughs - if not more - and does a great job of poking fun at itself and the ludicrousness of most Hollywood sequels.There's a few more car chases, but they're unconventional and quite amusing with the commentary the two leads provide. A fair bit of the humour comes from the fact that their undercover disguise as college-age students (i.e. they should be 18-21), which is totally unbelievable, seeing as Hill is 30 & Tatum is 34. Plenty of referencing the first film and stupidity of repetition in sequels (mostly by Offerman's Chief of Police - ""EVERYTHING is EXACTLY the SAME""!) and even casting the bad guy from 'Bad Boys II' - Peter Stormare - as the villain in this!Pretty good support cast - the Yang Twins are great as the across-the-hall stoners, Stevens is good as the love interest and Ice Cube has more to do in this film, which is a good thing and leads to a few hilarious scenes.Best bit of the film? Probably the many joke sequel posters/trailers they show! Highly entertaining and just plain funny to see how far they can stretch a premise. Quite reminiscent of 'Tropic Thunder', but definitely had the crowd in stitches! I do hope they make a third film, but if not, both 21 & 22 Jump Street will stand as some of the best action/police comedies ever made."
" Very good at what it does
",2017-11-03 00:00:00,7,"Well you may think this here is pure Hollywood formulaic comedy onanism that barely holds up a framework to merely work a quick plot, a couple of processed jokes and mix it up in the right convenient format with regards to length/acting/politics etc...And there's certainly a part of that, but this one here is actually well built and worth a watch. The management and resolution of suspense about who the bad guy really is for instance is really good, and it is as everything else in the flick: it doesn't take itself seriously, while still being well crafted.A couple of gags are a bit overcooked, and it isn't laugh out loud funny the whole time, but some moments are well worth the time (""do you like weather ?""), the secondary characters are very good, the action scenes are original and fresh and don't have that feeling of instant boredom as they only start like most action movies over the last decade, it's got very good pace and doesn't feel stretched or stale at any moment. And of course there's a good little moral woven throughout and at the end, and all in all it may beat the first.Good stuff. A deserved 7.5/10."
" Just like the last one
",2017-10-25 00:00:00,8,"This sequel makes no bones about the fact that it is trying to repeat the successful formula of '21 Jump Street' the Jump Street operation has moved to a new superior premises opposite the old one and Schmidt and Jenko are once again undercover in an educational establishment this time they are trying to find who is dealing a new designer drug in a college. Jenko quickly becomes friends with members of the football team, especially quarterback 'Zook'; this leads to our dynamic duo being invited to join a frat house Jenko fits right in but Schmidt realises it's not for him so goes and hangs out with the art student. While the athletic Jenko enjoys a night with the boys Schmidt spends the night in the bed of Maya, a beautiful arts student. Before the case is solved suspects emerge and an innocent man is arrested before Schmidt and Jenko finally face down the real culprits during Spring Break festivities.If you watched '21 Jump Street' and weren't amused then don't bother watching this; however if you enjoyed it then you should enjoy this just as much. The plot is basically the same as the first but the college setting allows for some different gags. Many of the gags are very meta with talk of everything being just the same as before and the sight of an empty lot with a '23 Jump Street' hoarding just waiting for their next HQ. While much of what happens isn't surprising a few unexpected things did happen the best being when we learn who the Maya's father is; possibly the funniest moments in the film resulted from this. The identity of the dealer is also a little bit of a surprise. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a good chemistry as Schmidt and Jenko and Ice Cube is great as their boss. Of the non-recurring characters Amber Stevens West and Wyatt Russell impress as Maya and Zook. Overall I wouldn't say this is the greatest film but if you enjoyed the first and want more silly fun then this is well worth watching."
" A Sequel that kept it up to the first part
",2017-10-20 00:00:00,9,"The only thing that I found weird is the whereabouts of Schmidt's girlfriend from the first part, they didn't really make any mentioning for her, which is obviously weird, but that aside, I loved this movie, it isn't any quality-lower than the first part, we're seeing different jokes, different plot line, same point, not straying too far from the franchise, and most importantly our favorite cast leads. Need you more ? NO.I would really like to see 23 jump street or whatever but the ending scenes clarified that it needs great originality to come up with another part, but let's just hope !9/10 Definitely would watch again"
" funny
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,6,"it was funny enough to consider as a good part 2 of the 21 jump street movie . it mocked itself few times saying its just like the 1st time but it wasn't which was a good turn seeing the same thing over and over again is frustrating which this movie kept to its minimum job well done by Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill was good Just like the 1st time ;)"
" Story is Not as Good, But Comedy is There
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,7,"Sequels sometimes suffer from not being able to live up to the predecessor, in this case, 21 JUMP STREET. Like the title of this review suggests, the story is not as good as the first film, but the comedy is definitely there. This time around, Jonah and Channing go to college to find the supplier of a new drug, WYFY.This film is somewhat of a mirror to the first film, in which Jonah played the popular kid in high school, and Channing was the nerd. This time, Channing is the jock and Jonah is the nerd. They still work under Captain Dickson (Ice Cube), but now at 22 Jump Street (across the street!).One of the funnier moments include a drive through campus in a golf cart style vehicle, chasing/being chased by the drug dealers; recklessly destroying anything and everything, much to the chagrin of Capt. Dickson. The other moment is the dinner that Schmidt has with Capt. Dickson, staring him down the entire time.A good film, suffers from sequelitis, but still funny."
" The level has decreased
",2017-06-28 00:00:00,4,"""22 Jump Street"" is an American 110-minute movie from 2014, so two more years only and this one has its fifth anniversary already. It is of course the sequel to 21 Jump Street and Jonah Hill as well as Channing Tatum reprise their roles here. The number of writers and directors who worked on this one here is fairly high, but eventually we have a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth. I liked the first film more than this one here. This may also have to do with my general dislike for two-time Oscar nominee (still hurts to say that) Jonah Hill, who is an incredibly untalented actor in my opinion. I like Channing Tatum more, but not to a level where I would say he is one of my favorites. Other than these, I was familiar with Offerman, Stormare and Ice Cube I believe. But they did not really have that much to work with anyway. Eventually, it is all about Hill (and Tatum). The plot occasionally reminded me of the first film when it is about the struggles in their friendship. But of course there were also major differences, for example in whom to consider the main antagonists. Unfortunately, I must admit that the villains, if you may want to call them that, were not really that impressive or memorable in my opinion. And also there was not one performance at all where I would say this one really stood out. I am a bit baffled to see that most people really liked this sequel and enjoyed it as much as (or almost as much as) the first film. I mean the first film with Jonah Hill of course. The Johnny Depp approach is once again something entirely different. Anyway, as a whole I would recommend this work really only to those who adore either of the two lead actors (and probably do perceive see Hill's acting here as really cringeworthy at times) or really, really loved the first film (more than me who ""only"" liked it). I think there were too many lengths in here for me to recommend it and it may have been better at 90 minutes runtime with better focus. Watch something else instead."
" Too long, too little substance
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,4,"There are a lot of week spots here, sadly. It's clear that ""22 Jump Street"" doesn't take itself seriously, but that doesn't make it funny.It's hard doing good a comedy. It takes good writing, timing and spot-on dialogue, none of which is present here. The film would have benefited from a shorter running time, and should perhaps have ended after the first arrestment. There's simply not enough material for the running time it has. Hill and Tatum have a few nice moments, but it's not enough and their chemistry is not very strong."
" On par(if not better) than the original; Would Recommend
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,8,"Directed by Phil Lord and Chril MillerStarring Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum and Ice Cube​ Plot Overview: Soon after they stopped the craze of HFS, Schmidt(Jonah Hill) and Jenko(Channing Tatum) go back under cover in College to stop a new drug from killing people.General:Overall: This movie is, first and foremost, hilarious. My main flaw with its predecessor is that the comedy got stale after multiple watches. That is different here. I've watched this movie more than '21 Jump Street' and still laugh continuously throughout. The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is great, even if it follows a similar plot thread to the original. The story is, yet again, very similar to the original but the movie embraces that and uses the fact its a sequel as a gag. I appreciate that but it doesn't excuse the fact its still a copy and paste with some uses of 'Find and Replace' for certain characters. Despite this, it's still just as enjoyable(I personally think more) as '21 Jump Street' and fans will most likely still enjoy it.The type of people who will like it will be fans of the more aware comedy and definitely fans of '21 Jump Street'. Would Recommend.Detailed:Both Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum were good as Schmitd and Jenko respectively and the chemistry they shared didn't feel forced and felt natural. Ice Cube was great as Captain Dickson and gave on of the funniest scenes in the entire film. Peter Stromrae was fine as The Ghost but he was still just a typical mob boss and didn't impress me much. Both Amber Stevens and Jilian Bell were great as Maya and Mercedes respectively, with Mercedes being one of the funnier characters in the film. Wyatt Russel was pretty weak as Zook and, along with Maya, was not a very compelling nor even that humorous character.I adore the entire premise of these movies but I do admit they've exhausted all possible ideas and to continue this franchise but be insulting the previous two films. Again, it was a full rehash of the original which was annoying but it still hits similar notes and retains the charm the original had on its initial watch but continues this throughout.The cinematography was decent for the most part but the editing could be quite choppy at point and it feels like some entire portions of scenes were just cut out. The effects were awful and the green screen was terrible. The actual costume and set design was actually pretty good and distinguished itself from the original. This movie is first and foremost a comedy and in that respect it succeeds. There is also some interesting action, even if it comes of as cheesy and can be a little stupid.The end credits are brilliant and the satire provided with them is absolutely genius and hilarious. The music was fine.Personally, I really enjoy this movie and feel like its more enjoyable than the original.8/10Would Recommend."
" Hilarious
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"The same friend who recommended that I watch 21 Jump Street also suggested that this one wasn't anywhere near as good. Unfortunately I am going to have to beg to differ because I discovered that the sequel was absolutely hilarious. In fact I was surprised that it was actually better than the original film (though it certainly wouldn't have worked anywhere near as well without the previous film). Where the first film had no qualms in laughing at itself, this film literally went overboard in poking fun not only at itself, but also the fact that it happens to be a sequel.Well, our heroes from the first film have returned, and as was suggested at the end of the first film they were going on a new assignment in college. Mind you, these guys to have a tendency of messing things up, and that is what they definitely did in the latest bust. However they are given another opportunity, and in a way it is following the similar theme of the first film – drugs are appearing in a college and they have to bust the supplier before it gets out too far. However there is one major catch – don't expect everything to be the same. For instance, if we remember from the first film that Hill was the popular one and Tatum wasn't – well everything has switched back to the way it was supposed to be.Honestly, I'm not sure if there is all that much more to say about this film, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but rather it is just what it is – an amusing film that pokes fun at itself. Sure, it is also about college life, but the thing is that there are plenty of movies out there that are also about college life. In fact there are so many that promote the college life that people seem to want to go to college simply to experience the lifestyle. Hey, I can't comment because the only reason I went to the university I went to was because of the prestige, and also the fact that a heap of my friends were going there, so yes, it was basically the lifestyle.However, the thing is that there are a couple of really interesting twists in the film, which I have to admit raises it beyond simply being another laugh out loud college flick. Okay, we also must remember that they are police officers, and they are on a case, so it sort of works both ways, but as with the previous film there is always the tendency of getting so caught up in the rolls that you are playing that you end up forgetting the reason that you happen to be there, which is basically why they ended up messing everything up. Still, since it is a comedy the major characters are of course going to have the propensity of messing everything up, and messing it up big time, which in part is where a lot of the laughs come from. It is certainly an enjoyable movie, and definitely a worthy sequel."
