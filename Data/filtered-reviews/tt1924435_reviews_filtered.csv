" A little bit funny
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,4,"This is another of Marlon Wayans' thrash comedies, don't get me wrong. It may have some funny bits but that's it. Plot is largely dumb."
" Occasionally funny, mindless movie
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,4,Ok if you want to watch some mindlessly juvenile entertainment. Made me chuckle a few times but not worth 2 hours of my life
" lets be pigs
",2020-11-21 00:00:00,7,Lets be cops is a harmless comedy movie about 2 guys 1 black the other white dressing up and pretending to be cops. Like all movies it starts harmless until things become outrageously dangerous.Throughout there is nonstop fun and silly crap.You'll get a good laugh.Its a rare fun comedy movie. ITs very rare to see a comedy movie this good these days.Verdict: Lets be smart. Go see the movie for once.
" New girl episode
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,7,"Honestly, it's a cute movie. I laughed out loud multiple times. It also has a lot of heart. Well worth the watch"
" Surprisingly Hilarious
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,9,"With some great chemistry from Damon Wayans Jr. and Jake Johnson, Let's Be Cops proves itself to be a surprisingly funny and very entertaining action comedy, that may seem familiar, but is quite enjoyable. I'll start off with the films flaws. The beginning of this film can feel a bit underwhelming, and even a bit choppy for some reason. It can be a bit predictable at times, and there are a handful of cliches that you have certainly seen in other cop films. However, despite all this, the film is able to be a incredibly hilarious action comedy- with laughs to spare. I loved the pairing of Wayan's and Johnson, as well as the improvisation of a lot of their lines and characters, as well as some from the rest of the cast. There are a few other supporting standouts in the film: such as Rob Riggle, Natasha Leggero, Keegan-Michael Key, and Andy Garcia. The film makes use of its wild and fun premise, and actually puts a lot of thought into the plot of the film as it goes on. It may not be the most realistic comedy, but I can certainly say I appreciate the effort it took with wrapping this film up, and giving it a conclusion that's not only satisfying, but surprisingly well made. By the end of the film, you will almost feel like you have been taken on this journey with them. That fact, and the fact that the main characters are more than just simple cop film archetypes, is what truly makes the film so special. And one I wouldn't mind watching again sometime soon.
My Rating: 9.25/10"
" An underrated gem that is a lot darker than the trailers suggest.
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,7,"This movie got overlooked when it came out but it's really not a bad movie at all. There are lots of hilarious moments and the jokes hit more than miss.It's a movie about two guys who are unsatisfied with their daily lives and decide to pretend to be cops for fun but get so deep into it that they can't get out since all of their fellow cops are none the wiser (which is completely unrealistic, but this is a movie, so just go with it). And of course, since they are now forced to do real police work without any kind of training whatsoever, they are waaaay in over their heads and hilarity ensues.Surprisingly, once they start having to fight real bad guys, the movie takes a bit of a dark turn. At that point, it becomes more of a ""Lethal Weapon"" type of comedy than the silly type of comedy that came before that. The sudden change in tone is a bit jarring and kind of takes away from the movie IMO. It was as though the movie was trying to be two different things when I wish it just would've stuck to just one.Having said all that, it's still a movie worth watching and is far better than what the critics said about it."
" So bad it was good
",2020-06-04 00:00:00,7,Super funny but also had a good amount of action and character development! It has a wonderful cast and crew who had great chemistry together! Best part of the movie was the end it really got me!
" Love this movie
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,9,"This movie is worth more than a 6.
5 stars its 8 or 9 easily. Very funny"
" Great movie to laugh
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,10,"Watched it with my best friend. Mainly ""men-humor"", all in all very funny and finally even really exciting in the story.Loved all the actors!"
" 2-hour New Girl
",2020-02-12 00:00:00,6,Surprisingly really funny even though it's a 2 hour episode of New Girl without the new girl.
" Waste of good idea
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,3,Could be good comedy but it wery bad. Childish but not movie for kids. Waste of good idea.
" Ignore the low reviews, this is a surprisingly funny movie.
",2019-10-25 00:00:00,9,"Hollywood relies on top billing comedy actors and stand ups and then delivers predictable storylines and action scenes. So recent comedies have become a parody of the comedy film format. I was worried this film would follow suit, but It was a pleasant surprise! It didn't rely on cheesy funny moments and kept me entertained throughout. I want a film that gives me something different, even if it feels a little unrealistic. I mean for God sake the most popular films of this century are about a rich entrepreneur that events a flying metal suit and joins a group of enhanced aliens and superhumans to protect the universe against a giant alien with a magic glove! So being a little farfetched isn't really a reason to hate on this film. This is easy viewing and a film you go into on a Friday night because there's nothing else to watch. And you won't feel robbed, because it's not a film that you really invested any thing in. You had no expectations and had nothing to lose. But guess what? You enjoyed it, and that's what it's all about. So enjoy!"
" The buddy cop movie in all of us!
",2019-10-07 00:00:00,10,"Don't listen to low reviews, if you like a buddy cop film with great comedy and great acting, this is for you!"
" Stupid
",2019-09-27 00:00:00,4,This movie has bad acting and a lackluster plot. The humour doesn't really cut it.
" Nice ,funny and not boring
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,9,"It is a nice movie,with a funny and twisty plot, Andi Garcia is perfect once more, but everyone is generally good.You will laugh,and that is all that matters."
" Let's Be Cops handcuffs itself into being the laziest comedy I've ever had the misfortune of watching.
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,1,"This is a first, ladies and gentlemen. I have never done this before in the entirety of my life, let alone in my current amateur critiquing days. You ready? Approximately fifty minutes in, I turned off the film. I couldn't do it to myself. I just couldn't! This. THIS. I made it through 'The Love Guru'. I survived 'Jack and Jill'. I watched 'Movie 43' and lived to tell the tale. But not this simple-minded ""comedy"". It flamboyantly waved everything I despise about modern American comedies right in my face, and I screamed ""No!"". Sit back and prepare yourselves, this isn't going to be pretty. Two friends, who are deemed failures in life, dress up as police officers and impersonate them in an attempt to spruce up their lives and have fun.At the time I turned it off, the tone somewhat shifted into tackling local vigilantism with some strands of ""taking justice into our own hands"", but I didn't care. I witnessed enough torturous humour to cement my sentiments early one. As you know, I'm not susceptible to comedy. Without tooting my own police siren, my resistance to laughing is impenetrable. Fortunately there was no struggle here, as not a single line of dialogue was effective. No smiles were cracked. No chuckles were heard. I was dead, inside and out. Let's Be Cops is, essentially, a five minute sketch drawn out for an hour and a half. You aren't going to take anything away from this feature. Nothing. Just the solidification of one's natural ability to withstand self-torture.Firstly, are the main characters that are so abhorrently frickin' unintelligent, that they had to physically type the words ""impersonating a police officer offence"" into a search engine, and be subsequently shocked by the revealed punishment? Have modern audiences degraded their minds so substantially that they find a naked obese man body slamming into one of the ""cops"", resting his sweaty genitals gently on their cranium, hilarious? Have we, as a species, become so unsophisticated that finding enjoyment from a child being forced to stab a man double his age to be outrageously funny behaviour? I apologise that I like my comedy with a hint of intelligence, but this was woeful. Absolutely frickin' dreadful. I'm sick and tired of these modern traits plaguing the genre. ""Oh, well if we have the characters dress up as officers, then atleast we can shove ten minutes of partying, purchase a soundtrack predominantly comprising of dubstep and get those pubescent teens booking tickets immediately!"".The screenplay literally comprises of scenes, unconnected to each other, that play out as if they were one minute YouTube clips. Ah, they got the wrong dress code for the masquerade ball! Woops, frickin' hilarious though, right? Game developers wanting to make a video game that includes zombies. I can't breathe. No, not because it's so funny that they are commentating on an entire industry, but because they ARE commentating on an entire industry. God frickin' damn. Johnson and Wayans had no chemistry. None. The former wouldn't shut the hell up and was infatuated with the sound of his own voice. The latter looked so out of place and timid that Johnson was just eating him up alive. Then the sexism. Oh God, the sexism! It's ridiculous! A group of women floundering along shouting ""Ohhh we have to kiss cops *mwah*"". Go away. Stop. Enough.You want to make a pro-police comedy? Grab a notebook, watch 'Hot Fuzz' and record the amount of times you laughed. Was it more than once? Well, that'll be one more than this piece of soul-draining pointlessly stupid incomprehensibly anger-inducing ""comedy"" has to offer.Y'know what? I'm not even sorry I didn't finish this. Which is a shame, as D'Arcy looked to have put in a good performance. However, life goes on. This is the turning point. I'm not buying another modern comedy again. Unless they're unanimously praised, I'm avoiding them like the plague. Quite possibly one of the worst comedies I've watched, capitalising on crude behaviour for apparent laughs. Let's Be Anything But Cops. Heck, Let's Be Gravediggers."
" A goof in the movie
",2019-08-22 00:00:00,8,"When Ryan is watching the college football game at the party. It shows the QB hike the ball at the 20-25 yard line, and then screen looks at Ryan for a split second, and it goes back to the game, on the same play the QB now hiked the ball, but he's at the 40 yard line."
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,2,"I hated it a lot. i wanted to leave before it was finished. it was almost 0 funny. neither of the main characters should be a lead in a comedy, or in anything for that matter. so many parts that were supposed to be funny were met with the sound of crickets. so many corny cheesy stupid parts. i just wanted it to end (1 view)"
" A fine comedy
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed the movie. With some good background songs according to the situation and occasional laughs, this was a fun movie to watch. Don't expect a total laugh outburst, but it can definitely lift your spirit."
" Film class review
",2019-01-25 00:00:00,10,"This movie is about two friends who pretend to be cops and end up finding a drug cartel dealer who is running Los Angeles. The friends try to talk to the real cops to tell them but the head of the detecive unit is the head boss of the group selling drugs. This movie has exaggerated angles, lots of close ups, and low angels. My favorite part of the movie is when they are being chased and are trying to be killed by the cartel for knowing who is involved and the two friends team up to take down the whole cartel. This movie is very funny and has action so you get action and comedy in the movie."
" Honestly, hilarious movie.
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,8,"The movies has its flaws, that's alright to say. However, this in my opinion is the kind of movie you just shut off and watch it. Needless to say, I enjoyed the movie. It was hilarious in my opinion."
" THIS IS MY COLLAR
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,4,"Two guys from Ohio haven't made it in LA and plan on returning. Ryan (Jake Johnson) a former Purdue QB relives his glory days, but doesn't have a job. Justin (Damon Wayans Jr.) is a video designer who has designed a cop patrol game. Our duo use the uniforms for a masquerade party and discover the perks of being policemen. Unfortunately they cross paths with a crime boss (James D'Arcy) leading to an improbable turn of events.I failed to find the humor in the film. This is apparently made for teens. The humor was lowbrow crotch in the face screaming man type of stuff. I was bored with a formulaic film that lacked any kind of clever writing or dialogue.Parental Guide: F-bombs. No sex. Male nudity."
" I really liked the movie
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,10,It made me laugh a lot and that's all i ask from a comedy
" This movie is halarious
",2018-09-15 00:00:00,10,This movie is halarious this movie and bad grandpa and this movie is just sheer comedy this movie is just like 21 and 22 jump street!!!
" Really Funny
",2018-08-31 00:00:00,8,Let's Be Cops was a really funny film with a great story idea. I think it's definitely worth watching.
" Below average
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,4,"A mix up of unpleasant and weird people, movie started good, seemed funny, but ended up regreting wasting 2 hours watching it, really needed better event sequencing, the black guy is really obnoxious and annoying, never seemed to be an all-round character."
" REALLY ENTERTAINING
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,7,"A good comedy movie, mixed with adventure.
Can't say bad."
" People think this is funny ??
",2018-04-26 00:00:00,1,"I can't believe all the ratings above 1 or 2 stars, I saw this movie not expecting anything and still found it so boring and stupid, what part is funny ???? The only part I liked was Nina Dobrev on shorts, she looks pretty hot, but outside of that this is a total waste of time, not funny at all."
" Definitely worth watching!
",2018-03-04 00:00:00,8,"I am not American, but I had so good time watching the movie. It was surprisingly very-very-very entertaining and made me laugh out loud several times. Which is rare.The idea is simply extraordinary and the production is generally a success. It's fascinating as you can keep the feeling of ""yeah-this-could-really-be-happening"" because the comedy is just so well done. While you know it could not be happening. It's hard to explain.Definitely not waste of time but good-quality fun."
" Good to not know anything
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Watched this last night on a lark on FXM. To say I'm pretty ignorant of most movies in the last 30 years or so would be an understatement, and I certainly never heard of this one, which was great, because I hate the dreaded PRE-CONCEIVED NOTIONS.
 Thus, when we figured out quickly that the two stars were actually gonna try to be cops, we knew we were in for a fun ride, and we were also 99% positive that the heroes would come out (somewhat) unscathed at the end.
 Main reason this got a ""10"" imho, is because it was a knee-slapping, laugh -out --loud comedy, and mainly, because it was unexpected.
 A final note - Nina Dobrev - wow, what a hottie! With my wife at my side, I had to keep the drooling to a minimum...."
" I thought it was going to be funny
",2017-12-09 00:00:00,3,I don't mean to come off harsh but I thought this movie was lame the comedy was sloppy. It was okay at one part but all and all I thought it was lame I liked a few parts but at the end I thought it could have been better. I am into dumb funny movies but this movie was over the top.
" The movie is much bigger than the idea itself
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,7,"Well, come think of it, it'd be a real challenge to get something big out of this concept of 'Lets be cops', but this worked very well. I laughed when I was supposed to love, I focused when things got serious, and voilà, the movie just delivered. Good acting, good directing, good script, and good movie-environment with likable actors.What a nice movie to watch with the mates ! 7/10"
" Simple Idea yet brilliantly funny.
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,10,"I'm not going to lie, the idea of having men pretend to be cops is not hilarious or genius, however the story, the actors and characters completely made it worth it. There was not a minute where I was not laughing. Completely kept me entertained and would watch it many many times."
" very funny!
",2017-08-07 00:00:00,8,"man, let me just start by saying that this isn't an over the top blockbuster film like everyone seems to expect from every movie that comes out now. For some reason people have these attitudes towards movies that aren't packed with insane plot holes and story details wrapped up in a cgi blanket to attempt to blow your mind. This movie is really a funny movie, no matter what anyone says. My girlfriend was having a bad day and I was low on energy to try to entertain so we went to see this for a few laughs. It didn't disappoint. I didn't go in with high hopes that there would be any real reason to like it very much but it came around within the first few minutes of the movie. We both left feeling better and like it was worth it, (and I am an adult so the 'teenager type jokes' that one reviewer referred to are unfounded). Jake Johnson really sells the image of a guy just looking for any kind of change in his life and Damon Wayans Jr. is and actor that really puts a lot of work into whatever role he is in. I don't want to ruin any of the movie with bits and pieces that I enjoyed more than the others so I am leaving you with this. If you have a desire to get enjoyment from a film without becoming emotionally invested in a story that lasts 3 movies or longer with hints and clues popping up all over the place eluding to a next installment of whatever series, (and enjoy comedy of all types) then I would recommend this highly. Not artistic, not over done, not offensive to the degree some say, just straight up good comedy. Waaay better than the terrible Seth Rogen movie ""the Neighbors"". Hope this helps."
" ***
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,8,"Two losers attend a masquerade party and thinking it's a costume party, dress up as police officers. This gives them the impetus to act and be like police. From e-bay, they purchase a police car only to meet up with the gang that had damaged their fender earlier.These gang members represent much more of a threat than first determined. They have been shaking down businesses to take them over so that they can launder money through them.There is romance and disagreement between our two friends along the way; they even fool real cops into thinking they're the real deal and soon team up to get the goods on this awful gang.Light fanfare and at least the police are depicted in a positive way."
" Hearty laughs
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,6,"I have a weakness for silly gross and cops comedies, and Let's be Cops has it all. I didn't expect anything from this movie, to be honest, as the ratings are quite (too) low everywhere, and I didn't know the actors.Johnson and Wayans have great chemistry on camera and are believable in their characters, that is the most important thing in cases like this.The story is a police prank gone too far and for too long mixed with a police investigation of a drug cartel. The story is very entertaining. Of course, this is a formula of a movie, with stereotypes, comedy formulas that work every time, the ending we expect, and situations and dialogues that will make you laugh. At least made me lol several times! Nothing original, for sure, but the ingredients are mixed in a nice flavorsome way, the actors are all good in their respective roles, and the end result is truly enjoyable if you just want to spend two hours having a good time."
