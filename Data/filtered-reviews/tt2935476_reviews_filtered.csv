" Kept me interested ....
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,9,"... even though I was fairly sure (but not certain) how it would ultimately play out. Great cinematography, dialogue, acting, casting an exquisite scenery. Period piece - a tad slow (but not terribly so, and probably necessary for compatibility with the era). Very relaxing, rustic. The characters were interesting (even the cad), despite being somewhat stereotypical; but the dialogue and action redeemed them, and I guess most people have to fit some stereotype or other. Had read Hardy way back in High School, but never this story, and love Carey Mulligan, so it seemed opportune to rent.. although I'm glad I didn't actually read it, because I gather that this novel might not have been one of Hardy's best."
" I would recommend it
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,8,A movie i would definitely recommend. Specially if you looking for a strong female lead character.
" An excellent main male character who could show what true love means
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,8,The leading man character is the best I've seen in stories so far. The main female character however is far for perfect and needed more experiences to grow up. It made you wonder what's so special about this girl that the man was willing to wait for her and work for her. Hah! Love comes in many forms. Some people get to receive the love that they do not really deserve but will make them realise to become a better person because of it.
" An excellent adaptation that feels modern
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,9,I love it when period drama's aren't afraid to show tension and chemistry in their love stories.. and this one has it in spades.Carey Mulligan is incredible as always and Michael Sheen will just break your heart.Absolutely adored it!
" Pretty much just annoying
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,2,"When I went to watch the movie I was promised a strong independent woman. A woman who doesn't need a man, who learns to survive in the salesworld run by man and sends away workers who don't respect her. Except that is not the story at all. It starts that way, sure, but within minutes she shows her true self. She is a woman who barely makes any decisions of her own, and sometimes even active asks man to choose for her! She says she doesn't need a man but very quickly marries a man she barely knows and has never really shown any respect to her at all! Every time she speaks to any of the 3 main guys she acts like a crushing schoolgirl, either not saying a word or being easily flustered.
The whole story is pretty much just three guys fighting for a woman who says she doesn't need a man. You could have replaced her with a sack of potatoes and it would have barely affected the plot.Also, when she eventually chooses the shepherd(seeing as the soldier is dead and the rich guy is in jail, so not really an active decision), she is pretty much begging him to stay, offering him everything. Nothing strong about it, it any way.Clearly a woman written by a man."
" Hard to watch
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,4,"I watched this thinking it was a cute romantic movie, well boy was I wrong. I didn't like watching the main character make bad decisions. But if you like dramas with a LOT of suspense this movie might be for you! Hopefully you enjoy it more than I did. :)"
" Creditable, if not charismatic
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,7,"In reviewing this film, it is hard not to contrast it with the classic 1967 version. This modern re-telling lacks the epic grandeur of this earlier film, and of the original novel, and, at under two hours in length, does feel somewhat rushed in places. Carey Mulligan may lack the glamour of Julie Christie, but is, perhaps, more convincing as Bathseba. One could never quite believe in Ms Christie as a hard-working farm-owner, prepared to get up at the crack of dawn and get her hands dirty, but one could, just about, believe that of Ms Mulligan. Matthias Schoenaerts is creditable as solid, dependable Gabriel Oak, though he may lack the charisma of Alan Bates. More problematic are Tom Surridge as Sergeant Troy; he seems too lightweight, lacking the steely menace and sexual allure that Terence Stamp conveyed; and Michael Sheen, whilst he makes Mr Boldwood sympathetic, also makes him into a nervous, indecisive character. Bathsheba (in the novel) is incapable of reconciling herself to marry him, though she admires and respects him, because he is simply too old, and too staid for her, and this is lost. The script is by David Nicholls (who also scripted the BBC version of Tess of the d'Urbervilles), and he captures the central themes, though the compressed running time means that some of the subtleties are lost. Although it can feel a little prosaic and pedestrian, more like a TV version than a cinematic epic, it is a creditable version of Hardy's classic novel, the best part of it being Carey Mulligan's performance."
" Speedrun
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,3,Great acting but the story runs so quickly . It's like doing Lordnof the Rings in 30 minutes . It need length
" falsely embellished
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,4,"This movie has amazing music, scenery, clothing, good actors... yet it made me feel nothing. Pace was too fast and character development was of low quality. As a viewer, I did not feel at all attached to any of the characters, nor did I sympathise with them, which comes in contradiction with the fact that they're supposed to be tragic. We see their hardships but they pass by indifferently, as the movie, in my experience, fails to ""touch"" the viewer. I have not read the book, nevertheless, having seen the trailer and the ratings, I had some high expectations that the movie failed to come up to."
" This is what failed good intentions look like
",2020-10-19 00:00:00,5,"I get it. Bathsheba was supposed to be an independent and empowering women who refused to settle but chose to cultivate her own farm. However, she fails at everything she does and she even settles, changing her mind so suddenly, to a wrong guy. Then, of course, she does what any desperate girl would do, giving up her career over a guy. And Gabirel Oak is her knight in white horse because he comes to rescue every time Bathsheba is in trouble. The scene where farmers cheer and clap after Bathsheba gets in the water to move the sheep is so corny, and the director already has prejudice that that kind of action by women should be cheered and roared. The director, Thomas Vinterberg, took the feminism backward or wrong way.Story development. Well.. the story never develops. When the plot is trying to go somewhere, it just jumps to another event, never completing the story. I did not read the book, but the book is very praised. When you want to make a movie out of the book, please please dele unimportant chunk audaciously and focus on a few important ones. It is just hard to watch a few sparsely dropped and unfinished stories.Setting is beautiful, wide, and free reflecting Bathsheba personality, dream, and hope."
" Far from the madding movies!
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,Every Bathsheba wishes to have a Mr Oak in their life who sees them for who they really are and believes in them no matter what! Free-spirited Bathsheba and dependable Gabriel have complementary personalities. Behind every successful woman is a supportive man.
" Beautiful, but something was missing
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,6,"This movie had lots of good moments. It was beautifully filmed, sometimes it reminded me of poldark. The music and costumes were stunning! But, it didn't have any soul or feeling. Even in the most intense scenes I didn't feel anything. It felt like they just wanted to be done with it. I don't know, I just expected more feelings."
" ""I Don't Want An Opinion On The Matter; In Fact, I Forbid It!""
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,7,"With these words uttered by Bathsheba Everdene (Carey Mulligan), I'll take my chances and express mine. There is much to enjoy about this film, most of the acting is good, the cinematography is breathtaking, as are the costumes and production design, not to mention the soundtrack by Craig Armstrong. People who were not familiar with the story prior to seeing Thomas Vinterberg's take on the classic 1874 Thomas Hardy novel may not understand why the story takes the twists and turns it does, when on the surface, the path of the heroine seems so simple.However, with Thomas Hardy, nothing is that clear-cut when it comes to human beings (specifically, human emotions), class differences, society rules and most importantly, fate. That is a word that is always present in his novels.As I said, the acting is good, but what really mars this film is its condensed running time; because of that, character development and several important plot-points are either downplayed, glossed over, or completely omitted. Perhaps the filmmakers and studio thought that 21st-century audiences wouldn't have the patience to sit through a film that was longer than two hours (the 1967 John Schlesinger epic-style movie ran nearly three hours, while the 1998 Masterpiece Theater miniseries clocked in at about 208 minutes), and in order to play up the romantic aspect of the film and to ensure that the audiences would get a pay-off, a few scenes were invented to capitalize on the relationship between Mulligan's Bathsheba and Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts). If you have read the novel or have seen the earlier adaptations, you already know how the story ends, but Vinterberg apparently felt that particular aspect needed to be emphasized more. While that's not necessarily a complaint, it does hinder some of the other characters and their dynamics that they shared in the original story.Michael Sheen, as the second of Bathsheba's suitors, the lonely and repressed William Boldwood, is something of a casualty (although not the only one) because his obsession with Bathsheba, who is almost young enough to be his daughter, is just hinted at, but not expanded upon. His rivalry with Sargeant Frank Troy (Tom Sturridge) is virtually non-existent, which was an important key to his character, and builds up to the story's climax. Troy, who succeeds in winning Bathsheba's heart for a short time, before his true character is revealed to her, is very one-dimensional here, again due to lack of character development and motivation, as well as the fact that his relationship with one of Bathsheba's farm workers, Fanny Robin (Juno Temple, who is not seen nearly enough in the movie) is treated in almost a fleeting manner. The tragedy that ensues doesn't feel as powerful as it should have been, in large part because of this. Bathsheba could have used more development as well; while she did manage a farm (an unusual position of power for a woman to have at that time), she was still a female in the Victorian era and her choices were limited; she had no romantic experience when Oak and Boldwood entered her life; she mistook passion for love with Troy and his deceiving ways made her a victim in that situation (as was Fanny). Troy is actually the true villain of the piece; while Bathsheba is careless and thoughtless at times, she doesn't really mean to cause harm to anyone. That's the difference between her and the man she married on a whim without really giving it much thought. Since, however, Troy is not given the screen time to show this to the audience, and a very important plot development that leads up to the climax in the book and the other two film versions is completely absent here, it may be hard for some to see what the point of the film really is.As the man who loves Bathsheba (""More than my own life,"" as he states in the novel), Schoenaerts is fine, but I would have liked a little more emotion and passion in his portrayal. While Gabriel is a steadfast, kind and patient man, despite his love for Bathsheba, he's not afraid to stand up to her or voice his opinion when he believes that she's wrong or being foolish. Schoenearts doesn't really convey Oak's frustration and heartbreak where Bathsheba is concerned. Mulligan does well with what she is given to work with, as do the other performers (Sheen is particularly effective). Mulligan and Sheen's rendition of the folk song, ""Let No Man Steal Your Thyme"" was a very good choice as the title and lyrics of the song clearly have a double meaning and even foreshadowing. Hardy's love of folk music was always present in his books and his prose.Entertaining enough and glorious to look at (although perhaps a tad too clean in terms of its depiction of rural life of the time), but if you want to see an expanded version of the story, watch the 1967 film or the 1998 miniseries. The book is, of course, in a class all its own."
" If you haven't read the book, this movie will look very silly
",2019-12-08 00:00:00,4,"I have to start with the pros: very good visual production, costumes, music and acting.
Now the cons: the script is really bad. And considering it's based on a book already written, this movie feels like a very swift summary of the novel, a trailer, without any in depth analysis of why things happen, how each character feels about what's happening and no real purpose for anything.... Halfway through the movie I felt disconnected, wishing it to be over, not caring for any character and considering it a waste of time. Probably there was not enough time to include all the action in a 2 hour film, as it usually is, but maybe some unnecessary long scenes could've been shortened for the sake of introducing new ones.
Nevertheless, I really want to read the book now, to see whether there's a better development in written than on screen.
I've seen better period dramas adapted from novels , this one didn't do it's job, in my opinion."
" Beautiful but more maddening than madding
",2019-12-07 00:00:00,6,I grew up with the book and the Julie Christie film when I went to the cinema with school and have loved both ever since.I also loved the 1997 ITV adaptation with Paloma Baeza (probably one of the finest TV film adaptations of a novel).This new version of the film has so many possibilities ... gorgeous filming and cinematography and a brilliant cast (thats the 6 stars) but the story is so chopped up and so much is ommitted that there is very little character development and however hard the cast try the script is just not fit for purpose.I presume they edited it down under 2 hours but that is no excuse - the book needs the scope of a 3 hour epic (at least).My recommendation is watch the TV version or the Julie Christie version rather than this.What a pity - I genuinely wanted to like it and see a fresh interpretation.
" Hardy's birthplace Dorset UK -a special place
",2019-10-09 00:00:00,8,"If you love this film, if you love Thomas Hardy, if you love rural Dorset, you need to know that plans are afoot to build 3500 new homes on the precious rural boundary of Hardy's birthplace, Dorchester!
Search for STAND Save The Area North of Dorchester to learn more and to support us. Thank you!"
" Beautiful period costumes but the character lack depth
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,6,It's hard to fall into this movie. The characters were not fully developed for such a complex and beautiful set. I would definately recommend it as a part of a study on period costumes and to take in the exquisite scenery.
" Very well done
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,9,A masterpiece. But only after you have read the book. All the emotions captured beautifully. It is only a pity that Troy's character and therefore motives for his actions were slightly changed. I wouldn't find any fault in this movie otherwise.
" No no no I will not.
",2019-06-11 00:00:00,10,"I didn't want this movie to stop. I just didn't. Hard life, hard work, loss, love, human torture of feelings from all areas of life. This was so good. so good!"
" A Hardy cut down
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,6,"Carey Mulligan has a difficult job in her hands. She is following in the footsteps of the divine Julie Christie who starred in the 1967 film version of Far from the Madding Crowd. You can understand why men immediately fell for her.Mulligan's Bathsheba Everdene is a modern, independent Victorian woman trying to make the Dorset farm she has inherited into a success.Stoic Gabriel Oak (Matthias Schoenaerts) is the neighbouring sheep herder who falls into hard times. Oak now works as the manager in her farm. A request for her hand in marriage in the past was declined by her.Wealthy, middle aged landowner William Boldwood (Michael Sheen) is also charmed by Bathsheba and his offer of marriage is also refused.Rakish, dashing soldier Sergeant Francis Troy (Tom Sturridge) does get to marry Bathsheba but the union is doomed. Troy was meant to marry Fanny Robbin (Juno Temple) who went to the wrong church in their wedding day.There is an economy in the screenplay. Oak's sheep fall off the cliff very early in the film here. Director Thomas Vinterberg has made sumptuous looking film, wonderfully lit countryside scenes with the sun shining. However this is not the Vinterberg who was one of the leading lights of the Dogme 95 movement.Far from the Madding Crowd comes across as a superficial romantic drama. The deepness of Hardy's novel is missing but it can be found in the 1967 version of the film."
" You had me at the soundtrack
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,9,"I have listened to the soundtrack many, many times. And until today I had not seen the film but I went in with high expectations. Just to make the story short; I loved it. The vibes were breath taking. The actors were amazing and the soundtrack is oh so good. Highly recommend you see this and experience it for yourself."
" Idyllic but it relinquishes the harshness required of Hardy's story
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,7,"A British romantic drama; A story about a headstrong Victorian woman who inherits a sheep farm in a remote area of Dorset. She struggles to maintain her independence while being courted by three very different men - a stoic farmer, a dashing, reckless soldier and a lonely older man. This is a well photographed version of the novel by Thomas Hardy, which deals with themes of love, honour and betrayal. It has less of the harshness of the novel and has a more succinct storyline, but is no less striking in its depictions of beauty and foreboding atmosphere.
Care Mulligan is well cast as proud beauty Bathsheba Everdene, though the differences between the three suitors are less pronounced in their differences. Sergeant Troy lacks power from an actor who is too young for the role. Schoenaerts' Gabriel Oak, however, gives a fine performance, stirring all the emotions. The film is well produced, strikingly shot, and captures Dorset countryside beautifully."
" A mostly interesting period piece/romance
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,6,"I haven't read Thomas Hardy's novel on which this film was based, so I can't say for sure how closely it adheres to the source material, but the narrative that is presented under the assured eye of Thomas Vinterberg is engaging. The performances from Carey Mulligan, Matthias Schoenaerts and Michael Sheen are also decent.Whilst I enjoyed the narrative, I didn't particularly find any of the characters that compelling, as there was more of a focus on story than character development. Other minor faults include some pieces of dialogue sounding rather unnatural at points, but this wasn't too much of an issue.Then again there is much to enjoy on a production level, with some lovely cinematography complimented by naturalistic lighting in the English countryside, whilst the musical score adds lots of gravitas and emotion to every scene.In the end this is something I would recommend."
" Great production
",2018-12-25 00:00:00,10,Amazing version of this classic story. Loved the cast and the filming and acting were first vkass
" Pointless remake
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,4,"If you saw the original move be prepared to be appalled. If you haven't, you'll probably find it watchable. I found it a passion less dewy eyed film with modern sensibilities. The actors aren't bad, but with the exception of Michael Sheen, they are lightweight and unconvincing. Cary Mulligan wears an expensive wardrobe in every scene and looks like she would struggle to open a door never mind run a huge Estate. Could only manage the first hour."
" Remake without a point
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,6,"Despite the strong first impression the sheer prettiness of this film makes, it wore out its welcome with me fast. The simplification--perhaps the dumbing down--of the dialogue has made these Brit Lit characters curiously inarticulate. Some of the acting is understated to a fault. Boldwood is reduced to someone who might more aptly be called ""Stiffwood."" Gabriel ends up seen but little heard. Sergeant Troy, however, comes on loud, looking like a tin toy soldier with painted red cheeks, or perhaps Gigolo Joe from A.I. The film club preview audience I was in applauded ironically when he got his comeuppance. While Ms. Mulligan does make a perky, punctual Bathsheba, here's the thing: ""We knew Julie Christie. Julie Christie was a friend of ours. You, young lady, are no Julie Christie!"""
" Enjoyable
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,7,"In 1874 in the farming country of southern England, a young woman (Carey Mulligan) of independent means and spirit is wooed by three very different men (Matthias Schoenhaerts, Michael Sheen, and Tom Sturridge).The story of the film is enjoyable though rather simple at times, veering occasionally into soap opera territory. What matters most is how it is presented.
Director Thomas Vinterberg brings out the beauty of the Dorset countryside with the great aid of cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen. Likewise, the performers all do fine work (especially Mulligan) in their many close-ups. It's a rather pleasant experience overall."
" Storyline decomposed
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,7,"The gist of the original is gone, hello simplistic hollywood. Quite nice & pastoral and interesting but nowhere near the original, especially the end.."
" Far from the Madding Crowd
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,7,"Very dramatic and extreme with the in-fighting, but quite interesting."
" Prefer Schlesinger Version
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,6,"Left me detached compared to '67 Christie/Stamp/Finch/Bates film. I gave that 8 stars. A scene that seemed to capture the times so beautifully in that version was the meal Bethsheba shares with her workers. There, she sat inside while her staff sat outside like they were at a picnic! In this version it all takes place very quietly in the dark with little obvious joy. Anyhow, worth seeing but watch the Schlesinger film for a better adaptation."
" Cinematic perfection - well, very nearly!
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,9,"Having read the book probably close to 100 times I was prepared to be disappointed in this screen version. However, the cast crew so perfectly captured the spirit of Hardy's novel I was deeply moved. Wonderful cinematography with painstaking attention to detail provided a visual feast.
Carey was a believable Victorian woman with an independent heart, which showed that she had really studied the book. It was uplifting to see her as a flawed but sympathetic character, without Hardy's sometimes patronising comments about 'women's frailties' sensed in the background.
I am entirely in love with Matthias' Gabriel Oak.
Although perfect in itself I would have loved the film to be longer to take in some more of the scenes from the novel.....particularly the one in the Malthouse where you see Oak amongst his friends and where Bathsheba rescues Oak from asphyxiation at the beginning of the novel, as this is very romantic.
The only real criticism I would have of the film is the opening gambit about Bathsheba's name, which isn't in the book as Hardy had a very clear reason for choosing her name."
" Great Cinematography and Acting Matched with Atrocious Writing and Pacing
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,3,"What an absolute waste of potential. The cinematography ... enchanting. The acting ... captivating. The writing ... incoherent and illogical. So much so that I couldn't help but wonder how this got through preliminary editing stages.Unlike most complaints of illogicality, this has nothing to do with suspense of disbelief. It has more to do with the overwhelming question riding in my mind throughout this film. ""Why""?Bathseda goes from a strong and enforced independence to abject stupidity in moment. Really. After having rejected 2 men, within 10 minutes of the nearly 2 hours of this film, she falls for and marries a man she met in the middle of the night while walking back home, and who just so happens to be a selfish drunk. Why?Perhaps you could just explain away her stupidity with love, but the film takes no time with it. Any emotion is thrust upon the viewer without even the simplest of justification. At best, weak explanations are added in afterwards to quell these questions (she married him was jealous and required a distraction; if you say so). Then within minutes the next man falls in love with her (all the men in this movie just fall in love and propose, there's no time for any justification behind this love that would actually make this movie interesting) and then shoots the husband who by the way was thought to have drowned. Who needs any sort of background behind any emotion when they can just throw love at the screen. Who needs any motivation? We have time constraints people.Moreover, the primary character, Bathseda, is so utterly unlikable that at best you can feel abject apathy. She fires a man who she is indebted to after he dared point out her capriciousness (after, notably, she asked for his opinion). This is until she needs him the next day when her livestock fails. Perhaps some found this stubbornness and pride endearing. I didn't. By the end of the film, my only investment was hoping she did not get her happy ending after so callously and irresponsibly using the people around her.The film only gets 3/10 stars because of the cinematography, which I can't stress enough, is so utterly amazing. Additionally, the acting was rather well done, with Carey Mulligan being a notable standout. It's a shame such cinematographic and acting skill was wasted on an atrocious plot."
" It reminds me of others, but it does not reach them.
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,3,"Watching this movie, I remember ""What the wind took"", the problem is that that same makes this worse. It is a feminist film, which at the same time goes against itself. For my taste casting is very bad. Neither is she the woman by all men would move heaven and earth, nor are they the men by which they would do it.It is too long and at no time has you tied. It's a love story, the rest is the least and you do not get to touch the sentimental side. You're not expecting me to choose any.The photograph also brings nothing. No help is a photograph without more.The address, since it does not get to hook you up, nor to catch you is not good. He does not know how to take the movie. He does not even have the camera. Neither did the casting wellI try to be a love movie. I am trying"
" ""It is difficult for a woman to define her feelings, in a language chiefly made by men to express theirs.""
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,7,"Since seeing the 2012 film The Hunt earlier this year,the memory of this magnificent, emotionally raw work has stayed with me. Hearing about director Thomas Vinterberg's adaptation of Thomas Hardy's book a few years ago,I was pleased to spot it airing on the BBC,which led to me joining in with the crowd. The plot-England 1870:Working on her aunts farm, Bathsheba Everdene catches the eye of neighbour Gabriel Oak. Falling for her,Oak asks for Everdene's hand in marriage, but is turned down by Everdene,due to her being too independent,which Everdene believes Oak would end up hating. As Oak leaves the village to go in search of work, Everdene inherits a farm from her uncle,and receives marriage proposals from William Boldwood and Sergeant Frank Troy, but turns them down to retain her independence. View on the film:Largely filmed in Dorset, director Thomas Vinterberg replaces the dour darkness of The Hunt with a beautiful English countryside landscape,with Vinterberg reuniting with the Hunt's cinematographer Charlotte Bruus Christensen to get down on the farm of rolling hills, a water colour palate,and the men offering Everdene their hearts in magic hour lighting. Separating from the crowd, Vinterberg uncovers Everdene's most inner feelings via smooth as silk tracking shots that close in on each subtle emotion that goes across her face.Giving this adaptation of Thomas Hardy's book more of a feminist slant, the screenplay David Nicholls displays a real precision in the dialogue of capturing Everdene's inner straighten, and refusal to be viewed as a damsel waiting for her prince charming. Kept to a brisk 112 min run time, (not the 119 IMDb say) the limitations of time lead to none of the men being as fleshed out as Everdene,with Michael Sheen giving more emotional depth to William Boldwood ,than appears on the page/dialogue.Joined by Sheen, Juno Temple and Matthias Schoenaerts, Carey Mulligan gives a magnetic performance as Everdene,thanks to Mulligan showing Everdene's startling femininity in close-up,and delivering the dialogue with a confident firmness that makes the maddening crowd go wild."
" Far from interesting
",2017-09-14 00:00:00,5,"Thomas Vintenburg is known for his harrowing dramas; and Thomas Hardy was known for his harrowing novels. It might not seem so surprising therefore that the Swedish director should direct a film of a Hardy novel; except that 'Far From the Madding Crowd' is more like a rom-com than a typical Hardy book, inviting us to sympathise with a feisty heiress surrounded by good-looking suitors. Like any conventional rom-com, the ending is known from the start, and the only real question is how we are going to get there. It's true, Hardy uses a rather sui generis mechanism to get rid of two of his three rival lovers; but nonetheless, the story is somewhat familiar overall and I found it rather dull."
" Felt rushed
",2017-08-28 00:00:00,6,"Having now seen this twice,I feel this adaptation could have been so much more. Let's start with the good points; cinematography is beautiful, the countryside has never looked more stunning, makes me want to visit it more often. The actors are on form - Sheen really delivers,the part of Liddy is also worth noting. The music is also good and doesn't impose.Now the bad, it felt as if the director picked the main bits of the book that he remembered from class and packed them into the film. The atmosphere and build up is definitely missing. I think half an hour more could have added more and given it the payoff that it deserved. In short it ended up being a late Sunday evening affair that should be on a TV screen rather than cinema."
" Far From my Expectations
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,6,"Far From the Madding Crowd is one of my favourite novels, so I was looking forward to what looked like a well-cast, nicely shot film. The truth is, however, that if I hadn't read the book first, this adaptation would not have encouraged me to read Hardy's novel. It's not a bad movie by any means, but it does have a few problems which were maybe unavoidable in adapting this late Victorian classic into the contemporary cinematic environment. I had two main problems in this respect; the first is that of timing. The running time is just under two hours, and yet a good third of the book is swallowed up in just the first fifteen minutes. This is not necessarily a bad thing, however I felt as though all that extra time could have been better spent in exploring Bathseba's interactions with her second and third suitors (Troy in particular, but we'll get on to that). Rather Oak takes up much more of the screen time than necessary, and, being a naturally stolid and stoic character, does not provide for that compelling a screen presence.The second problem ties much into the first, in that the sped-up first fifteen minutes gives us a foundation whereby Batsheba openly declares herself to be an independent, DIY woman who 'don't need no man', which is not really carried through for large chunks of the rest of the film. In the novel, Bathsheba's independence of spirit is demonstrated through her brusque actions, often blunt speech and stubborn pride, rather than simple declarations of her ambition and character. As such, when in the film, she falls for Troy, (especially in such a short amount of time given the length of the picture) it is quite jarring and doesn't really fit with what they seemed to be going for at the start. For most of the rest of the adaptation, themes, ideas, and even the scenery are presented with the subtlety and restraint characteristic of Hardy, but I feel the independent woman stuff unfortunately didn't work as well - which is a shame.As such, it makes it difficult for me to recommend this film unless you've read the book first, as seeing this adaptation could possibly impair the experience of what is a wonderful novel. Again, I may sound quite harsh on what is a competently made, well-acted, well- scripted, well-scored movie. If you simply want to see these things, by all means it is a perfectly enjoyable diversion for a few hours. However, if you're yet to discover Hardy's Wessex (oddly changed to its real- life parallel Dorset in the film) I'd recommend you dive into one of the English language's finest authors before viewing this particular adaptation."
" Makes one really swoon and there's not much maddening
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,7,"The book is a masterpiece, it's perhaps Hardy's most accessible book and one of his best, his way of words and vivid descriptions as well as the beautifully realised characters demonstrate that. Some may question whether he was on Bathsheba's side or not, not so to me.Of the three versions seen of 'Far From the Madding Crowd', this 2015 film is my least favourite. This is not meant in a bad way, that it's still good with a lot to admire says a lot about how excellent the 1967 film (which holds up even better than when first reviewed five years ago, when much younger and with a less diverse taste in film and when less perceptive and more headstrong in how opinions were expressed) and the 1998 TV adaptation are. Those who love the book will find various aspects underwhelming, but taken as a film judged on its own two feet it's a worthy effort with many great things. Which is what makes it disappointing that it wasn't even better.'Far From the Madding Crowd' (2015) is not perfect. It does feel too safe and more of a conventional period piece when there is much more to the story than that. The structure, basic details and the essence of most of the characters (excepting Troy) are all there and the romantic elements (more heavily emphasised here) is done incredibly well, but the depth is missing.You can tell from seeing the previous adaptations regardless of whether you've read the book or not that the characters are not as complex, as said Troy is far more interesting than his treatment here. As is some of the rural colour like the lack of refinement for the locals and how they loved to gossip, near-jettisoned in favour of emphasising the romance more. 'Far From the Madding Crowd' is also a quite bold and at times idiosyncratic story, the previous two adaptations captured the boldness and wit more. The wit comes through in this adaptation certainly, the boldness doesn't.Just as problematic is the writing and performance for Troy. As said more than once already, Troy is much more interesting in the source material than here and with more complexity. One, as said above, doesn't even need to have read 'Far From the Madding Crowd' to know if having viewed either of the previous two adaptations that Troy is more villainous than usual and is rather one-dimensional. Tom Sturridge didn't do it for me, the way the character is written does work against him but he never looked comfortable in the role and fails to bring out the rakishness, solider-like demeanour and charm (regarding the latter one does need to see what Bathsheba sees in him, that is a failing here). Occasionally the film is a tad rushed, especially in the stripped character development of the underdeveloped characters that are not the four leading ones.However, 'Far From the Madding Crowd' looks ravishing. Especially in the cinematography that is even more radiant than Carey Mulligan's Bathsheba (the late harvest scene is indeed just one of the highlights), while the scenery and costumes are beautifully detailed and evocative in their meticulousness. While spare, a wise decision, Craig Armstrong's music score is every bit as good as the scores for the previous two adaptations, with every scene that it appears in beautifully scored and sensitively used. The rendezvous in the woodland is a masterful marriage of visuals, editing (also very much stunning in the film) music, acting and amorous atmosphere.Even when adaptation-wise the film feels too on the safe side, the script still manages to be very literate and the wit and tragedy of the story come over amusingly and poignantly. The story is, despite the lack of depth, still compelling and the heavier emphasis on the romantic element registers so strongly that it makes one swoon. The romantic tension is done very well too. Won't talk about the feminist slant that has been mentioned at the risk of it causing controversy in later reviews, other than that perhaps it wasn't really needed.Most of the characters come off well still. Bathsheba is particularly well-realised, one gets the sense of her being an ahead of her time unconventional character and because it's a long way from irrelevant today one can still relate. Thomas Vinterberg directs with a lot of spirit and, other than Sturridge, gets great performances from his heart.Carey Mulligan is one of the standout components of 'Far From the Madding Crowd'. Her wonderful, hugely compelling performance captures Bathsheba's fiery free-spirit, affecting nuances faintly modern nature, beauty and eagerness, even when Bathsheba is prouder than one would expect and not as vain. Matthias Schoenaerts is a sensitive, integral and remarkably dignified Gabriel Oak, with brooding eyes and an expressive understated face. Another standout is Michael Sheen's Boldwood, Sheen devastates and Sheen brings many colours to the character that allows one to feel sorry for him.In summary, admirable, gorgeously mounted, spirited, romantically swooning and very well acted, but too safe. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
" A rural romance
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,8,"Bathsheba Everdene, an attractive young woman living in rural Dorset, has caught the eye of local sheep farmer Gabriel Oak. He proposes to her but she declines, she values her independence in an era when married women were effectively the property of their husbands. Soon both their lives undergo major changes; Gabriel loses his farm after his dog chases his sheep over a cliff edge one night and she inherits her uncle's large farm. She needs a shepherd so employs Gabriel; while he is still poor there is no chance of romance but he still loves her and is determined to make a success of his life again. Meanwhile Bathsheba jokingly sends a Valentine's card to wealthy but lonely neighbour William Boldwood; he soon falls in love with her but once again she declines a proposal. Then she meets Sergeant Frank Troy and is swept of her feet. He had previously been due to be married to a girl named Fanny Robin but believes that she stood him up at the altar, no realising she went to the wrong church. She makes a bad choice but will she ultimately find happiness?.Since I haven't read the book I can't comment on how accurate a rendition of that story this is but as story I rather enjoyed it. Carey Mulligan puts in a fine performance as the spirited Bathsheba and Matthias Schoenaerts is solid as Gabriel, Michael Sheen and Tom Sturridge also impress as Boldwood and Troy. There are a few 'tragic moments' but for the most part life looks surprisingly pleasant in Victorian Dorset; the harvest scenes look like jolly fun rather than the backbreaking work I imagine it was in reality this isn't really a problem though; this is more fun to watch. It isn't obvious who Bathsheba will ultimately end up with, Thomas Hardy isn't renowned for happy endings, but it is pretty clear who we are meant to want her to be with and who we really don't want her to be shackled to. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of costume drama as well as a romance that isn't a rom-com."
" Not a patch on the 1967 adaptation
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,3,"I watched this adaptation of Hardy's novel for the first time this evening, hoping it would at least have some of the spark of the original 1967 version. It does not. Carey Mulligan was cool, distant and just not convincing, whereas Julie Christie was sexy and emotional as well as being a hard-headed business woman. The male leads in this new version were equally like cardboard cut outs, although Gabriel Oak did have something of the original Gabriel about him. The memorable scenes from the original version just were not there, for example the meeting of Troy and Bathsheba at Maiden Castle, the actual Iron Age hill fort, was played out in a wood.....and was not at all sexy. The lesser characters also did not come over as country farm workers....the scenes where they sang and got drunk just were not good enough. If you want to get the closest feel to what Thomas Hardy was writing about, stick to the 1967 version and read the novel too."
" A poor comparison
",2017-08-20 00:00:00,7,"I am a lover of the version which starred Julie Christie, Peter Finch and the wonderful Alan Bates so it is impossible not to draw comparisons with this new version. Carey Mulligan is a favourite actress of mine but she is not the Bathsheba that Christie was. You could really believe that men would fall head over heels in love with her. Carey Mulligan is just not that beautiful. The new version looks good but again, nowhere near the lyrical beauty of Schlesinger's film. The story is well told but lacking in the power to draw one in like the earlier version. Finch was just superb in the first film and one really felt his anguish and pain due to his love for Bathsheba."
" A definite ""do see"" movie
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,10,"Diane and I watched this engrossing anð captivating movie version of a book that she had read in high school; obviously, we viewed the film at her behest because I avoided the book when it when it appeared on my reading list in my lower class.I mention all of this background to give the readers, such as they may be an idea of why I rated the film as a Ten. I did so because I thought, as well as Diane, that it was a superbly moving film that the Director had rather meticulously adapted from an older book into a faultless adaptation as a brilliant movie.I was unfamiliar with the story in any way so the entire unfolding of the beautiful film was completely new to my philistine ways. The film followed the story line of the book in a journeyman like manner but in a precisely soft adaptation of the book's story line. The dialogue was never arrant or off-putting. In short, it was a wonderful movie that could easily be viewed on several occasions."
" Superficial Film Adaptation of a Great Book
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,3,"Watch the GREAT BBC adaptation of the Hardy book. This is a waste of time. Sturridge is particularly bad and miscast as Sgt. Troy. Jonathan Firth, the brother of Colin Firth (King's Speech, Pride and Prejudice), is a much better Sgt. Troy. The BBC miniseries had the time to fully lay out the plot and address the intricacies of the book. This version is like reading bad cliff notes. The dark atmosphere is also all wrong. You don't get a sense of the gritty yet vibrant everyday life surrounding the characters. Farmer Oak (sturdy as an oak) is just a love sick calf in this film. In the BBC series, you see a subtlety in the performance and not a depressing dogged joyless devotion to a women who can't make up her mind. The BBC version also shows you Bathsheba's caring relationship with the town folks who depend on her for their livelihood. You see how and why she becomes so devoted to them and how their lives are intertwined. Accordingly, you understand why her marriage to Sgt. Troy is a disaster beyond her own story and so poignant. The one thing that makes this film bearable is the performance of Michael Sheen. He is simply superb. In the BBC version, the actor played Boldwood as a raving lunatic. It is all wrong. Sheen's performance gave you compassion for the character and displayed the depth and pathos of his devotion and unrequited love for Bathsheba. He is a much better actor than the man who played him in the BBC series In fact, Sheen's performance is the only reason to watch this mediocrity."
" Simplistic Plot
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,6,"What a simplistic plot!!! like a children's story all her mistakes are resolved for her, and get out of her way. She married the wrong guy? Oh no problem, the other guy who she likes least will kill him for her, so she can marry the guy she likes best, who by the way was ignored so far, and stupidly just remained by her side! Oh and since I have to write 10 lines, I will add more of her charms! She behaves selfishly, does what she says she doesn't want to do, and never seems to take responsibility for her actions. Somehow, she is such a sweet and lovely woman that she can do whatever she likes, and people will still love her. And the point of the movie is unfortunately this, that after she makes mistakes, the right choice is always available for her to come back to."
