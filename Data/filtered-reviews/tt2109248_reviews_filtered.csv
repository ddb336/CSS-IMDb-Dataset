" The beggining of a new trilogy, the best and most mature Transformers movie, with excellent cinematography and soundtracks!
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,8,"Fantasy/action movie. After the closure of the first Transformers trilogy, this film comes as the promising fresh start to a new trilogy. Apart from Optimus and Bumblebee, there's no other character from the previous movies, though there's a connection to the third film and the big fight in Chicago. The fourth film is The Age of Extinction for Transformers. After the great battle in Chicago, all cooperation with the Transformers is interrupted and a CIA team hunts down all Transformers. The only collaboration between the people and the CIA with Transformers is with Lockdown, a lone, merciless and experienced bounty hunter, who pursues Optimus. So the Age of Extinction is very pessimistic for all Transformers. A financialy struggling inventor with his daughter accidentally finds the wounded and weak Optimus and decides to help him, until he finally confronts the CIA and Lockdown and they all become fugitives. The new trilogy, though Bay's well-known humor remains, is much more serious and mature than the previous one. In place of the immature young Sam comes the engineer inventor Cade Jagger (Mark Wahlberg) who lost his wife early and raises his daughter alone, while CIA involvement and the impending annihilation of Transformers make things more dramatic. The film also brings some positive messages, even though it's an action movie. Also, the film was very well-crafted, filmed both in China and on the ice in Antarctica, while the extinction of dinosaurs was also linked to the plot of the movie (dinosaurs and landscape of the films were highly realistic, excellent work on that part too). Also, Megatron, although he returned as Galvatron, was much inferior in design to most films and remained in a second villain role, since the main villain was Lockdown. Still, in this film, one of the great weapons of the opponents was the huge alien ship, and one of the best scenes, the scenes with the skyscrapers, so it was very reminiscent of the third film and the huge robot drill in the skyscrapers. In the technical part of the film, Bay really surpassed himself and is giving ""directing lessons"". Excellent effects, unique shots, landscapes and scenery, as well as close-ups with perspective, slow motion scenes, and excellent filming on set, cinematography in its best! All this combined with top soundtracks by Steve Jablonsky and the unique masterpiece of Imagine Dragons, Battle Cry which was probably the best and most fitting track of the entire Transformers series, but also the relaxing and enchanting All for You. Age of Extinction was technically the best film of the entire Transformers series by far. Even if you haven't seen the previous trilogy, you can start with this movie and skip the intensely immature elements of previous movies, while enjoying great shots, great soundtracks and plenty of action.Personally, it's my favorite movie of all Transformers movies, though in scenario it's a little inferior to the third movie which was the most complete in my opinion."
" Nah I don't like these type of meaning action movies.
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,1,"Stop streaching the story like chewing gum, it's getting already taste less."
" This is not a good film
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,3,"I really dislike how this franchise portrays women and overall I think it sends the wrong message. I do like the idea of the American hero combined with alien robots, it's a recipe for good entertainment, especially when it involves Stanley Tucci, but the execution was unimpressive at best and I ended up being bored half the time."
" They're losing it
",2021-02-08 00:00:00,5,I enjoyed the first three but this one is bit of a downhill. They were losing what they were good at. So yeah.
" Plot
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,4,"Transformers Aee's plot was ridiculous. Even though the scenes of the movie are beautiful, the story handling is bad."
" Superb movie
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,10,Another best from series. Age of Extinction is best than Dark of the Moon
" Reviews have been way too harsh
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,10,"Transformers 4 is definitely not a 5.6 on IMDb, bizarrely low rating! Not a ten either, to be honest, but I just felt the desire to try to do a tiny bit to nudge the overall rating higher.Great music, editing, CG, and a little more story, quite charmingly told. I like Bay's visual style, I think it's unique and very compelling, beautifully lit and warm. Sure, his movies are clunky in parts, but they're just great popcorn fare, so I can't see why he gets such bad reviews, seems unfair!And the transformers in this movie are quite fantastic as well, plus a nice and long bit of storytelling, a real journey. So a totally decent bit of entertainment, easily a 7 - 7.5 on IMDb!"
" Fun, good action, but way too long and pointless plot
",2020-12-08 00:00:00,6,"There are some very cool battle scenes, and this movie is a great way to break in a new 5.1, or 7.2 sound system.On the downside, the plot is flimsy, if not downright confusing and baffling. And the movie is entirely way too long, with too many battle sequences which waters down the overall product."
" Its Shiny and Awful
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,3,"Its looks as good as any of the Transformer movies but that's as far as the compliments can go.A terrible plot (and plot is too strong a word).Does have the odd funny moment but not remotely enough for such a long movie.
The longer I went the more I was thinking 'well at least it looks good'!The best part is you can drop it from the first trilogy.Autobots...Deactivate"
" I just enjoyed.
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,10,The movie is great I love it <3 and enjoyed it. I'm a transformers fan. This is another hit but unfortunately I was so much late when I add the review I watched this in the year it released. However the movie is good I love it.
" Some badass action sequences covered in an lacklustre story
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,5,"Age of Extinction (2014) is a sort of a soft reboot of the continuing series. I have an genuine affection towards the Transformers movies, they are sort of my guilty pleasure films. Even though I have mixed feelings towards this movie, I've got to say this is the worst of the Bayformers for me.With an entire new human cast, the plot is still much of the same. The story is very lacklustre and formulaic. You know how this movie is starting introducing the characters, the gonzo weirdness happining in the middle with a bunch of exposition, and the explosion packed last act with lastly Optimus Prime delivering a speech written straight out of Shakespeare. The fault I place at Ehren Kruger who wrote the screenplay solely for himself, and I don't get why Paramount or the producers didn't look for a better one. Also the script who is otherwise very self-serious and grave still find place to some parody of itself. An old cinema owner in Texas talk about the new movies coming out just being bad sequels and remakes.The acting is not good, Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) is the cliche american single-dad hero living on a farm in Texas. He has some interesting thing going on in the start when he shows his inventor skills and meeting Optimus Prime, but then he have to share screentime with his uninteresting daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) and has some excruciating jabs with her racing car boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor). The movie is going for a more darker and gritty version this time. That is mostly clear with the bad guys. In the lead we have Attinger( soullesly played by Kelsey Grammer) and the laughably tough guy with a dark cape and glasses James Savoy (Titus Welliver). Stanley Tucci is the best part out of all the characters, and it was hilarious how he just went totally out of his character in Hong Kong and yelled at every thing happening. For our robot friends we thankfully got some cleaner designs and new characters with a distinctive personality (My favourite Hound voiced by John Goodman). And Galvatron is outshadowed by a much more compelling villain in Lockdown. His subplot with Optimus Prime should have had a much bigger role. It has to be said that this movie follows the trend by the one before of being way more violent and aggressive than its predecessor. Especially the heroic leader Optimus Prime just seems pissed the whole movie for being stucked with these pitty and tiny humans.We don't come for the Transformers movies for the plot but for the awesome action as many have pointed out. And to finish my positive feelings towards this movie, the action is good. Some highlights are the prologue, which shows how the dinosaurs was eradicated . An aerial battle in Chicago, and the last 20 mins when the dinobots finally show up. This movie lasts 2hr45mins which is obviously too long. The pure raw destruction we see in the last 20 mins are delightful, with Optimus riding Grimlock and a giant spaceship sucking up everything consisting of metal. The action choreography is an improvement, especially seen in the 1v1 fights between the robots. It is way easier seeing who is who than the first movies rapid editing. The visuals are a bit uneven but mostly good. It looks more shiny and clear especially on the transformers. But some probably unfinished scenes, contains a blurred background that are easily notable. Also the new transformation pixel thingy looks horrible. The technical achievements have always been top-notch in Transformers, and the score by Steve Jablonsky is both emotional and earth shattering. Other flaws in this movie is the over abundance of product placement. Bay don't care anymore. He just shows an entire scene revolving around Marky-Mark drinking a bud-light and threatening a random citizen. Then in the last act we just travel to China for no apparant reason (Galvatron literally says, ""Get the seed to the largest city"" Hong Kong really?) than to please the asian market, and if you look at the global box office it was a success. This earned over 1 billion dollars. Critics can rave negatively all they want but this franchise clearly shows that if the audience shows up nothing else matters."
" Wahlberg Explosions!
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,6,"I was a huge fan of Transformers growing up in the late 80s and early 90s watching the cartoon series and collecting almost all of the action figures. Then years later as an adult it was announced Transformers was getting a live action movie so naturally I was excited to finally see my favourite Autobots and Decepticons on the big screen fighting and transforming into awsome vehicles and weapons. I went to see Transformers (2007) on opening day and it was a load of rubbish and it only got worse with each sequel. Then when the awful Shia LaBeouf trilogy finally ended I was looking forward to the franchise going in a new direction thus Transformers: Age of Extinction was made.I have only recently gotten around to watching Transformers: Age of Extinction due to the fact that upon release it got bad reviews and quickly ended up in on the bargain shelf at my local movie store.I surprising enjoyed this Transformers movie I mean it's by no means a masterpeice of cinema or anything but compared to the previous Transformer movies it's certainly a step in the right direction for the franchise.The main parts of the movie I enjoyed were of course the action scenes which look amazing and show off the much better CGI effects than in the previous movies. This being a Michael Bay film though there are a few too many explosions throughout the movie but considering the fact that it's a Transformers movie it's to be expected at this point. The fights between the Transformers are actually pretty cool and are full of swords, guns, grenades and of course metal fists. There's also some pretty cool looking dinobots in this movie which have some interesting designs the only downside to the dinobots however is now the Autobots look like the Power Rangers going into battle with their Megazords.The list of things I didn't like about this movie is sadly at lot longer than the things I did like. The first issue I have with this movie are the human characters Mark Wahlberg's character is enjoyable and has some genuinely funny and badass moments however he is followed around by his teenage daughter and her boyfriend throughout the entire movie. The teenage daughter is the most annoying and unnecessary character in the entire film her only purpose in this movie is to be eye candy for teenager boys all she does is get captured and complain. The teenage daughters boyfriend is also a completely pointless character I guess he was added in mainly so Mark Wahlberg's character isn't alone in the action scenes till the other side characters show up but other than that he serves no real purpose in this movie other than to annoy people with his fake Irish accent.The second issue I have with this movie is just how ridiculously implausible some scenes are I get that this is supposed to be just a science fiction action movie about robots from outer space but it's the small things that often ruin what could of been a great scene. The two things I kept noticing consistently throughout the movie is no matter what happens to the characters they manage to keep perfect hair and makeup aswell as not having an inch of sweat on them dispite the fact that they wear the same clothes for days and get into ridiculously over the top battles and spend most of the movie physically running at full speed. Mark Wahlberg's character is meant to be a scrap inventor who collects old junk but he looks like the most jacked up, clean and well dressed hillbilly in existence same with his daughter she puts on lipstick at the start of the movie and by the end it's still on her lips without so much as a smudge.I lost count of how many times the main characters should have died throughout the entire movie. They survive everything from explosions, car crashes, fire, gun fire, being inside a Transformer while he transforms, falling into a Transformers hand from fifty foot drops like it's a safety net. They just walk away from every battle without so much as a scratch on them if you took a shot of alcohol everytime Mark Wahlberg should of died you'd die from alcohol poisoning.The movie also has way too many plots and side plots going on all at once this movie is over two and a half hours long and it manages to cram in three different main story plot lines aswell as ton of pointless side plots that are unnecessary and boring.The last thing I will say about this movie is that I personally felt that it is just too long after two and a half hours of explosions and Mark Wahlberg you can't wait for the movie to end they could of done us all a favour and cut out all the filler and the pointless side characters and made this movie an hour and forty minutes of action that would of been more than enough.I recommend watching this Transformers movie at least once it definitely has it's flaws but compared to the previous movies it's at least an enjoyable action movie that manages to deliver on it's promise of explosions and robot fights."
" Bring ShiA labouf back
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,3,"Mark wahlberg sucks, the story was poor, we want the og back"
" There were improvements to the franchise
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,5,"Age of Extinction holds a dismal 18% on Rotten Tomatoes and 5.6 on IMDB and whilst there are better blockbusters out there these scores are a bit harsh. Most criticisms focus on the subplot between Shane and Tessa (i.e. the Romeo and Juliet law scene), the catering to the Chinese market, and the product placement. These weren't unwarranted but there were some improvements, like reducing the number of Autobots down to five and giving them some characteristics. I would be lying if a scene where Optimus Prime fights a robot dinosaur appeals to my inner 10-year-old. I personally think the bulk of the plot where Transformers are getting hunted and an company experiments on them would have fitted better as the first sequel."
" Better than the last knight
",2020-09-10 00:00:00,7,"This is movie is underrated. The action scenes are phenomenal, the composing and cinematography are some of the best things about the movie. I'll admit that writing at parts could've been a little bit better and sometimes gets a little messy but it really does have its moments where it shines"
" Elements to be enjoyed but a bit lengthy
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,6,"I'll start by saying this isn't the worst of the Bay Transformers movies and I can't quite fathom how this has a lower user rating than Revenge of the Fallen. Let me explain how I feel about the inner workings of Age of Extinction and where I feel it falls in quality in comparison to the others. Let's talk dialogue... it's not good. It's pretty bad in fact. At best it's okay and at worst it's basically laughable. ""My face is my warrant"" stands out. The characters (humans at least) are also not up to par with the LaBeouf trilogy with the exception of Stanley Tucci who is as magnificent as ever and definitely the stand out. Story wise there's basically nothing here, that being said I didn't exactly expect Citizen Kane. I must say I do like the 'Remember Chicago' backdrop and Autobots in exile subplot as it is nice to know despite the lack of Sam Witwicky we still inhabit his world and the practically apocalyptic events of Dark of the Moon weren't forgotten whilst AoE was being conceived. The action is a little less consistent than that of the first 3 but it still has a few of those jaw dropping set pieces, namely the ones with the Dinobots who are near perfect and my only complaint is that they showed up so late to the mix. The sequences with Galvatron are fast, flashy and exciting, although I'm not particularly a fan of his design, especially after the brilliant redesigns in the first few and the original Galvatron from Transformers: The Movie. Lockdown is also a pretty fine addition to the franchise, his unaligned loyalties to either Autobots or Decepticons makes him far more interesting than he has any right to be. In summary... Age of Extinction is a fine popcorn flick that falters where it's script is concerned but succeeds in being a visually engaging, mindless action romp. I'd place it above Revenge of the Fallen but no where near as good as Dark of the Moon or Transformers (2007). A strong 6 to a light 7"
" Transformers: Age of extinction
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,10,I am 36 years old and I grew up watching Transformers the cartoon and playing with the toys in the 80's. The franchise had achieved mind share. The plan worked.The first and second live action movie didn't do much for me. The one I enjoyed the most and actually felt something for was Dark of the Moon.Until Age of Extinction. I really enjoyed it.
" Waste of time
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,3,"What a load of garbage. This film is a complete mess with incomprehensible CGI battles, shaky action, no storyline and completely unlikeable characters. At least the original trilogy had a stuttering buffoon we could follow as an audience surrogate. There are no redeeming features in this film and no reason to watch it."
" Above average...
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,6,"""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie and the fourth movie of the ""Transformers"" franchise, in which we watch Optimus Prime being hunted by a bounty hunter and a mechanic with his family along with the Autobots trying to help him.I consider ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" as another average Sci-Fi movie that had a simple but interesting plot, some good interpretations and an average direction made by Michael Bay. It's not a bad movie but it should be far better than this and as in the previous movie I believe that it did not reach its true potential. Since I had already watched all the previous movies I was expecting something equally good with the first movie which surprised me and it reached the potential of ""Transformers"". Unfortunately that did not happen with this movie and I do not believe that will happen again."
" A virtual lobotomy.
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,1,"Michael bay movies are dumb by themselves which is compounded by the fact that Bay apparently thinks that his work actually has cultural value. If he was just open about the fact that he is a one trick pony that produces mindless fluff for an audience of retarded goldfish, then it would be fair play, but NOooo! He actually tortures writers with these empty action extravaganzas.If this is you guilty pleasure. Fine.. But if you rate this movie higher than a 4, you have mental issues."
" Transformers: Age of Marky Mark
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,6,"The fourth installment of the franchise started a new trend for the transformers, Autobots and Decepticons alike, downward. Not to say this wasn't an entertaining film for you can always count on Michael Bay when it comes to high quality action and special effects. Unfortunately, action is not a story line (Sorry Michael).I'll give Wahlberg a B+ here because he played Cade perfectly, but that doesn't mean it was a good role to begin with. The other people in the movie get a C, and the voice actors, especially Optimus, are still great.I had fun watching this movie and I love the transformers series. It's cool, exciting, and definitely different, but this installment is just not that good. Outside the action and explosions, there isn't really a plot that thickens or twists that really draws you in. Megatron is back, of course, but that doesn't mean the magic of the transformers series is. I still got my oohs and ahs and laughs out of this film like the others so I really can't say it was all that bad though."
" For Michael Bay, what matters is the visual spectacle. The bigger the explosions and the shorter the actresses' shorts, the better
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,6,"""Age of extinction"" is a kind of reboot of the franchise, being a sequence of ""Transformers: The Dark of the Moon"", after 3 years of the events in Chicago. It is the first feature of the series that does not have the participation of Shia LaBeouf, main actor in the first three, and has a completely renewed cast, with the exception of five robots: Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Brains, Ratchet and Megatron (now in the form modified to Galvatron).A few years after the great confrontation between Autobots and Decepticons in Chicago, the giant alien robots disappeared. They are currently hunted by humans, who do not want to be in trouble again. When Cade (Mark Wahlberg) finds an abandoned truck, he could never imagine that the vehicle is actually Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots. Much less that, in helping to bring him back to life, Cade and his daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) would be targeted by the American authorities.Before getting into these equal elements, though, let's look at the differences in Age of extinction. Ehren Kruger, responsible for the ""script"" of the two previous works, returns to the same position looking for a kind of reinvention of the mythology of the series. We saw the insertion of creators of the Transformers, who only appear at a glance, but are mentioned throughout the plot. With that in mind, the opening minutes of the projection take us to a prehistoric Earth, revealing that the extinction of the dinosaurs was, in fact, caused by alien beings. A cut, then, takes the work to the present, where researchers discover a frozen robotic dinosaur. Here we could expect a repetition of the first film, with the awakening of Megatron, but the text decides to insert this pleonasm in an even less creative way. The tyrannosaurus robot is overlooked for most of the work.In the United States, on the other hand, one of the criticisms of the previous film was that the city of Chiacago was practically entirely destroyed, without any consequence for the residents of the city. Michale Bay, as always, was only concerned with destroying everything. In this fourth part of the franchise, we see that the tragedy generated commotion among the Americans and the Transformers came to be seen as threats. Even the Autobots, allied to the humans, became targets of the CIA's relentless hunt. However, despite its promising start it was soon lost amid explosions, destroyed cities and empty characters. The exchange of Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) by Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) changes little in the story, the character remains just a piece there in the middle, a lever to activate the flame of Optimus Prime, the eternal hero of the day, and greater focus of the film. After the death of the maternal figure, Cade and his teenage daughter Tessa (the beautiful Nicola Peltz) try to live together, despite the differences between them. A specialist in robotics, Cade tries to extract from his repairs and inventions the sustenance of his home, without success. In one of his negotiations, he comes across an old truck and decides to take it to the ""laboratory"". Little does he know that the old can is none other than the leader of the Autobots and that his problems are just beginning. Here, the script tires the viewer through a completely unnecessary subplot between father, daughter, Tessa Yeager (Nicola Peltz) and her boyfriend, Shane (Jack Reynor). Unintelligible and predictable jokes occupy the many minutes that see such interactions on screen, already building the biggest of the work's problems.It is also worth mentioning Stanley Tucci (from The Hunger Games) and Kelsey Grammer (from X-Men: The Final Showdown) as the illustrious time to pay mico in the series, a position occupied in the previous features by John Turturro and John Malkovich, but here with less embarrassment. As Joshua Joyce, Tucci is a scientist who develops a technology that makes it possible to create Transformers. Grammer, for his part, is Harold Attinger, a veteran agent who coordinates the hunt for the Autobots. However, absolutely none of this saves the production of sameness.
The new cast, as much as they bring a new story and, in certain cases, even different characteristics, are only brief distractions for what really matters: the battles between robots. They are mere knickknacks that are only there to give the film the human element, essential for there to be some thread of identification in this context. In light of this, it does not matter how bizarre it is to see a Mark Wahlberg broken into playing a robot creator or that a rally driver hired by Red Bull is hiding in the countryside of Texas, in the middle of nowhere. Coherence, what for in a Transformers movie? As it could not be otherwise, the film suffers from the exact same filming problems as its previous ones. Shaky cameras, frantic montage and lack of creativity in the design of the creature's mix, creating a complete visual mess. The repetition also extends to the script when we realize the complete irrelevance of the villain within the plot, which had already presented an effective antagonist. The feeling left is the old attempt to insert even more action scenes in a feature film that already has an exaggerated number of them. When we arrive at two o'clock, all we can do is look at the clock in desolation and see that there are still 45 minutes of CGI overdose. Michael Bay proves, once again, with Ehren Kruger, that they can't do anything different and even a reboot proposal is more like a remake. The few qualities of the work are completely overshadowed by its marked defects. The incredible thing is that such bizarre situations present in the series' scripts are so ingrained in their core that now Michael Bay himself plays with them. That's what happens when Optimus Prime is found inside an abandoned cinema - in fact, how a truck ended up in a cinema ... forget it! - And the former owner of the place complains that it was good in the old days, when they were making real films, that now only half-bowl sequences and remakes were made (a sign of irony turned on!). Or when Stanley Tucci's character, full of delicious debauchery, jokes in the elevator about being chased by giant robots and CIA agents who wanted to kill him and still have an alien artifact with the potential of a nuclear warhead in hand. - all of this in Beijing, it's good to stress! That is, the absurdities are already part of what is expected from a film in the franchise.""Age of extinction"" makes the same mistakes as ""Revenge of the Fallen"" and ""The Dark of the Moon"". More explosions than it should, while new robots are presented in a shallow and flawed way, being used with a sloppy appearance in production. Coherence does not exist and old characters are ignored, while the past is used only around the events that are used to build the new pursuit. One of the main defects of this film and of the whole series is the long duration of the editing. It's almost three hours, which results in an incredible amount of unnecessary twists and some false endings. The constant search for a bigger battle than the previous one is too tiring. For all this, the only way to leave the cinema quietly after so much flying towards you is to recline the seat and try not to think too much. As much as you like to see robots fighting each other on the big screen, this dramatically reduces any impact that the film could cause.This is even more serious for those who have seen the previous features, since the effects, especially the transformation of vehicles into robots, are no longer impressive. Robot dinosaurs are amazing and visually stylish, featuring an interesting variety of ""species"". But their origin is so poorly explained that many people leave the room without understanding why they appeared or how Optimus Prime ""domesticated"" them. Once again, I remember: it's Transformers, that is, any kind of logic goes far from the idea that the writers have for the series. Autobots are more and more beautiful and well rendered, much more organic than in previous films, real living beings. And the highlight goes to its diversity, never explored before. We have a Samurai Autobot, Bumblebee has a more ""ninja"" aspect, and there is an Autobot that mixes something between a war general and a bearded dwarf, who even smokes a cigarette made with a bullet shell. It remains for Michael Bay, director of the previous features, to juggle with the camera (something he knows very well how to do), to generate some adrenaline. As in the previous film, specifically, 3D also deserves to be highlighted. In addition to the ""items flying from the screen"", we have interesting depth work, creating layers in the visual and making the visual experience much more immersive, something very interesting for the film.For Michael Bay, what matters is the visual spectacle. The bigger the explosions and the shorter the actresses' shorts, the better. ""Age of extinction"" is superior to the second film, Revenge of the Fallen, but inferior to the first Transformers and also to The Hidden Side of the Moon. The well-balanced humor of the original is missing and the grandeur of the third. For those who are fans of the series, it doesn't matter: they will see you and probably love you - the basic rules of the formula are there, don't forget. Strange as it may seem, the bright spot in Age of extinction is Mark Wahlberg. With characteristics of action hero, his character, Cade Yeager, is much more interesting than the dull Sam Witwicky of Shia LaBeouf, protagonist of the previous films. Too bad Cade has arrived now, when the series seems to have so little to offer. A change in direction might be a solution to give the franchise a new lease of life."
" This hurts to watch.
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,1,"A dang near 3 HOUR MOVIE. Oh my gosh. I don't have problems with long movies. I have problems with long movies that suck, which this does."
" This movie's just terrible in every way.
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,1,"Unlikeable characters, incomprehensible action, unfunny jokes, way too long, some of the worst product placement Michael Bay has ever done.Not even effects are that good this time. That's like the one thing the other movies had going for them.
It's all horrible.There are good films, there are bad films, and then there's this, whatever it is.Awful, just awful."
" Absolute Trainwreck.
",2020-05-13 00:00:00,1,"Truly one of the worst disasters I've ever had the misfortune to endure. Stilted and unconvincing acting, indecipherable action shots, some of the most banal dialogue ever written, a lack of continuity that boggles the mind... this movie had it all. It truly stands out for failing SO hard in SO many categories, but even all of the aforementioned deep and terrible flaws pale in comparison the editing that was apparently done by a child with ADHD and a LOT of sugar.
This was possibly the worst piece of drivel I have ever seen. Avoid at all costs."
" Didn't someone told the makers that they need a story also
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,5,"Transformers: Age of Extinction is a science fiction action movie directed by Michael Bay and stars Mark Wahlberg, Nicola Peltz, Jack Reynor, Stanley Tucci, Kelsey Grammer, Sophia Myles, Li Bingbing, T.J. Miller, Titus Welliver and James Bachman. Voices for transformers were given by Peter Cullen, Frank Welker, John Goodman and Ken Watanbe.
The best part of the movie is the movie is very action packed with amazing special effects and unfortunately these are the only best part of the movie.The start of the movie is good and interesting but as soon as the movie progresses it's fells apart as director wanted to try too many things.Acting is just ok and Mark Wahlberg is under-utilised. The biggest drawback of the movie is headless plot and length. The movie also gets slow and boring in between.The movie is purely for action lovers and some viewers can be disappointed with the length of the movie."
" I like this movie alot. Some problems though.
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,8,I like the autobots. I liked the action sequences between them and the decepticons. The plot to me made more sense to me then the plot to the other movies. It made as much sense as the 2007 movie. The seed part not so much. I don't agree with the hate. If you like the other three then you might like this one. Lockdown was a pretty cool villan and the special affects were really good and vivid.
" A total reconstruction of the franchise
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,10,"As I predicted in my review of dark of the moon.In fact I was surprised when this movie came out. The Sam Whitwicky story didn't really have anywhere else to go, and all of the other government ""agencies"" and other aspects of this universe had crashed and burned. So there was literally no one left to rebuild the franchise, other than the autobots themselves.And of course all of the autobots get a downgrade, then, and upgrade, including Optimus prime.Also this film is peppered with great character actors like Stanley Tucci, as well as a lot of new fresh faces.What is extremely interesting about this film is that they used a lot of real life robots that actually function...This film brings the Autobot universe to its lowest Nadir and then back up to its peak, while also delivering a lot of Autobot history. Were the Transformers born or were they made? That's not quite answered in this film either, it seems that we learn one history in one movie or comic or cartoon, and then a different one in another.But that's what makes transformers great and why kids continue to love them to this day, because they are always changing, always transforming, while staying the same- mainly in the case of Bumblebee, and I was very pleased that they started making individual transformer films."

" Solid reboot
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,7,"This is, yet again, another time when I disagree with Rotten Tomatoes. This movie is AWESOME!!!! Just forget the previous 3 films happened. This is both a sequel and a reboot. Only this time, the movie works. I think Micheal Bay is learning from his mistakes. Although this film is not without flaws of its own, it's not a pop culture travesty like ""Transformers 2 and 3"" were. The plot is original, (well, as original as you can get when the movie is about robots fighting each other and also based on a property that's existed for 30 years), the dialogue is humorous intentionally, and the soundtrack by Imagine Dragons makes this film even better than I expected. However, the film overuses slow-motion shots. I don't mind if it's used once or twice, but not during every fight scene. Contrary to popular belief slow motion does not make everything look cooler, It can, if used sparingly and correctly, but not like how it's used here. I felt like this film focused to much on the human characters. The movie is called ""Transformers,"" not ""Humans."" If some of the unneccesary scenes, such a one of the characters drinking milk on the roof for 5 minutes (I'm not kidding, this is a legitimate scene. Seriously.) and had used that time to show what we came to see, robots beating each other up, the film could have been a bit better.
Grade: C 7/10 3/5 stars"

" Optimus CRIME
",2020-02-06 00:00:00,1,"I re watched this film today, it was on Netflix and thought why not. Maybe I was in a bad mood when I first watched the film because I remember it was utter garbage when I saw it in the cinema.And yeah it's still utter tripe... unless you are a toddler this film is about as entertaining as a wet kipper on a Wednesday afternoon.The script is terrible. The 'humour' is soul destroying, the effects are good until you see the whole Mazda zoom zoom transforming in mid air nonsense... those effects are dreadful in comparison to every other CGI In the film so I'm not sure why they kept them in (other than not giving a damn).And while I'm on that subject... are we suppose to believe that humans are able to roll out this tech and the transformers never were able to ?!?? Like REALLY?! Anyway I am lacking anymore will to write anymore.. just recalling this drivel has me pooped.Ultimately this franchise has become a cash cow with this film in particular the lowest of the low. The popularity of the series Is fueling its own downfall. It seems to me that anyone Involved in the filmmaking of this poo feels no pressure to make an effort as the film will sell anyway. REBOOT PLEASE"
" Enjoyed everything but the boyfriend
",2020-02-04 00:00:00,10,"Enjoyed the movie as much as other except the daughters boyfriend. He's just a s#!t head and honestly a very horrible individual toward the dad. He really is an unnecessary character with a stupid personality that brings nothing to the movie, and it kind of ruins all scenes with him involved. Other than that just enjoy what you can"
" If you like lots of action, explosions, and giant fighting robots, this is for you!!!
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,9,"I can understand why this movie has a rather low rating. The script isn't the best. So if you're all about the plot, character development, and the overall flow of the storyline, this probably isn't for you. The first half had little action with lots of dialogue which was a little confusing as to who's on whose side and what everybody's intentions are sometimes, but you figure it out. Then the second half of the movie is pretty much all battle scenes and no storyline. I think people are over exaggerating and non-appreciative for the sound and visuals because it wasn't that bad to deserve all the 1-3 star ratings. My other small complaint was this movie felt a little too long. But boy oh boy does it deliver with some epic battle scenes! If you're like me and don't care too much about all those other things I just mentioned, but more so like a good action-packed movie, you'll probably love this. The visuals are just as amazing as all the other transformer movies. There are even more giant robots fighting, very cool cars, and of course explosions. What stood out in this movie was the soundtrack which was hands down better than the first three transformers. If you're an audiophile with a legit sound system, this will blow your mind, literally! And I'm not talking about a wimpy soundbar or dinky satellite speakers, I'm talking a system with 15"" ported subwoofers and 5+ channel bookshelf/tower speakers. It's the bass you need to experience with a movie like this. I only have a 5.1 sound system, but the surround sound is already amazing, and this movie furthermore supports Dolby Atmos, so I can only imagine what that would be like! My subwoofer got a good workout as well shaking the house with all the explosions and other intense bass frequencies. It's not very often the cooling fins on my sub amp get as warm as they did with this movie. Overall, I was still very satisfied after finishing the movie despite the subpar script. I'd say the simplicity of the storyline and endless action make it geared more towards teenagers. This movie definitely has a different overall flow and style to it, so know your preferences before watching this and leaving another senseless 1-star review."
" Haha, oh my God....

" Revenge of the Fallen has competition
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,3,"Dull and pointless film. Michael Bay tends to take one step forward six backwards. The plot is not ideal and casting Mark Wahlberg wasn't an inspired choice. I still don't understand this storyline and I've seen this 3 times since release. Transformers was on a steady decline after the first film, with only Dark Side of the Moon providing a slight glimmer of hope. Unsure why they thought such a mind numbing film was necessary. Much like ROTF, this has no real excitement to recommend it. Most of the other films has incredible spectacle for the finale, but not here. Too much of everything, excluding a coherent plot."
" Entertaining.
",2019-12-21 00:00:00,7,"This is not as near as bad as the critics want you to think. It has nothing really new for the franchise, but it has good action and a reasonably entertaining plot. It's a Transformers movie, what on earth are you expecting? If you think it's bad, then so is the rest of this franchise. It's a teen movie, ffs.Not the best Transformers movie, but definitely not the worst."
" Poor, cliche, dispensable...
",2019-12-12 00:00:00,3,"My recommend is: don't watch this movie, is just a lost of time"
" Best Transformers movie until now
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,6,"A more compelling narrative sets off the fourth movie at brisk and more endeavouring story. A new menace and foe is introduced, as if the decepticons hadn't bern enough.A colorful portrait of greedy capitalists and misunderstood patriotism blends well with the storyline.New visuals add more soul and character of our beloved Transformers, who in previous movies have been stale and one-dimensional. Should you know the original cartoons, you will also rejoice with the addition of much beloved Autobot allies.Changing the primary cast from nauseating Shia LaBeouf to Mark Wahlberg and Kelsey Grammer has added significant depth to the characters although Michael Bay persists in exagerated use of emotional clichésAge of Extinction holds a darker and deeper story than the previous editions, and comes with a hearty recomendation...."

" Michaelbaychian
",2019-08-30 00:00:00,5,"The fourth chapter of ""Transformers"" franchise signs a kind of little reboot, changing actors and characters. But this doesn't manage to improve the saga that remains giant and noisy entertainment cinema. In particular, in this movie the narrative structure is composed by two oppositions, good and bad men and good and bad aliens, with the interference between the teams. They are treated themes like familiar problems (father, daughter and daughter's boyfriend), alien invasion and especially the problem of identity and origin of life for these living machines. But all this inputs are just put in a too much long cup without a real examination of psychologies and without a strong plot: we can see the movie pass from a fast and furious-like car film to actions to catastrophic epopea. In all these cases the aim is just to entertain superficially the spectator with explosions and apocalyptic fights that are the true (the only) quality of this movie. As the others: there a lot of worse action or sci-fi mainstream movie, but the entire Transformers saga is weak and commercial. Two words: Michael Bay."

" Above Average: 6.0
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,6,"The second and third Transformers films were awful. There's no getting around it. Lacking any self-awareness, and full of cringe-worthy scenes, both Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon rank among the worst films ever made. So imagine my surprise when I was watching Age of Extinction, and was actually enjoying myself. It's not a great movie, of course (and it's arguably not even good). But compared to the last two films in the franchise, it's practically a masterpiece. But that's not to say that it's very dissimilar its predecessors. The human characters are still less human than the robots, the dialogue is dubious (though the ratio of action to dialogue is considerably higher this time), and it can get visually confusing to decipher what's happening onscreen. But these are flaws that the other three movies had as well, and Age of Extinction easily tops all but the first one in terms of pure quality. I had fun, and that's more than I can say for my experience with Michael Bay's last six years."

I was annoyed for half the movie.I liked and hated this movie. I liked most of the stuff to do with the transformers and I hated everything that had to do with the humans. EVERYTHING. The whole cast was terrible. lots of bad acting and horrible dialogue. and it was barely funny when it tried to be. made me realize how great Shia and John torturo were in the last 3.michael bay went a little overboard with pushing the limits of believability. lots of parts where you say there is no way they would ever survive something like that. some of the action scenes were phenomenal but some of them were a little confusing and hard to follow. a bunch of stuff in the movie seemed to try to mimic what they did in the third one. Definitely a lot of questionable parts but whatever. a lot of corny and cheesy parts...very late one night, i wanted to watch a movie but i knew i probably wouldn't be able to stay up for the whole thing. so i picked something fun that i didn't mind stopping halfway thru. and i was happy i chose this one. i looked forward to finishing it the next night.i keep coming back to this movie. the good parts are awesome. the great parts are amazing. goosebump-inducing. i watched most of the human parts on 1.6x speed. i should've just skipped em. i think you can edit this movie into something half-decent. and i would watch it again but skipping all of the human-only scenes.

" Stunning visuals and action sequences.
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,6,"The film has a new cast and I must admit I really enjoyed the characters. They have more depth and I cared more about them. It also did not have the annoying romance interest set-up that was present in the previous films. Mark Wahlberg makes a credible hero and breathes new life in the franchise. Stanley Tucci stars as billionaire Joshua Joyce, an engineer who now builds his own Transformers. He is such a great actor and I enjoyed him in this installment.The visuals and action scenes are once again spectacular. The photography is the best in the series so far. The cinematography is also outstanding. This was INCREDIBLE!! For a film almost 3 hours long, this fast-paced action fantasy thriller was never boring. I must be honest, I did find the first half better, as the second part becomes incredibly CGI-heavy. It was nevertheless still entertaining and amazingly well done. We're also introduced to a few new Transformers.The only thing that really annoyed me, was the American flag. I mean, it was just everywhere and always in frame! Michael Bay is oh-so-patriotic. That was just too much..."

" Revenge of the Fallen was worse
",2019-05-10 00:00:00,5,"I don't think anyone in their right mind would spend time writing a detailed and analytical review of a Transformers movie. These movies are clearly made to sell toys and make bank from the kids that go see it. Since this movie was directed by Michael Bay, there are certain things you should expect - shots of female bodies from low angles, overuse of slow motion, American flags, helicopters with dawn in the background, amazing CGI and productions, and 5th grade dialogue. All are present in the movie. If you go see it keeping those things in mind, you may even enjoy it a little bit. I can't rate it higher than a five because it's Michael Bay extravaganza and I can't rate it lower because the dialogue was hilarious and the action was great."
" Mind numbing nondense
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,3,The 'best' part of the film is when there's a car chase from America to China and it takes less than 2 minutes. Apparently it's the next city down the road. With logics like that you can get an idea about the rest of this mess of a film.

T.J. Miller also was a nice addition to the cast, but I'm surprised he didn't play a bigger role in the end.
I liked that they tried to freshen up the crew of the Autobots and 1 of them worked pretty well while the others are quite forgettable.
The addition of the villain and his plan is alright, but they could've given him more rememberable gadgets and looks when he is by foot.
The beginning and the ending of the movie are decent, everything in-between is a lot of mediocrity."

That's why I abandoned this saga years ago.Recently, on an unoccupied afternoon, I decided to give it another chance with this one and I've regretted ever since! This should-not-be-called-a-film is nothing more than a series of CGI put into a non-sense plot. It's so stupid and illogical that at some point, I just kept fast-forwarding to watch the next CGI robot battle, hoping to finally get some fun out of it. But no, in the end, the only thing that I had was just a headache, and I was so mad with myself for losing my time on this garbage.And to Box-Office-killer Mr Bay, as he will no doubt continue with his style (and make more and more money...), I really hope that he can give more ""brain"" into his future products. No offence, cause I, too, am a fan of good CGI, and a just-very-simple plot could be fine in this type of film.

I thinks transformers 4 is a good movie because there is action, the movie is very good for the cast special effect are really really good .I like the story it is slow in the beginning but the end is beautiful there are the full action, there are a fight there a the explosion it is a war. I doesn't like the moment when the women is in the space because is no fight it is very slow and sad. The best moment in transformer 4 is when obtimus prime go to fight the king of the robot, obtimus win the fight and the king help obtimus for the final fight. The end is weird because the builder of the enemy help the autobots , the movie is full action if you like the action, you can love transformer 4 for the action and the story, you should like it.
//In my opinion the movie is amazing. The special effects are really good, the sound of battle are wonderful, the robot looks real, the robot can also be transformed into a vehicle and I like the main characters. I like the colors in the movie, there are many colors.

",2018-09-24 00:00:00,1,"Easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Too much budget not enough plot. Who the hell wrote this? Some intern who needs a break? Well the only thing they're continuing to break is this franchise. What's worse is Michael Bay isn't slowing down. Michael, take a hint. You're sucking at these movies. Take a step back, take a deep breath and take your time writing these movies, make them suspenseful. Don't rely on Special FX to make your movie."
" THERE'S A MISSILE IN THE FAMILY ROOM
",2018-09-10 00:00:00,6,"The movie starts in the Arctic, prehistoric times, Mexico City, Texas, and Chicago. I was expecting good bots vs. bad bots for control of the earth, and got something similar...after all there are so many places a story can go and unfortunately they decided to give us a taste of all of them. Mark Wahlberg, the world's greatest inventor, on the brink of poverty, is introduced early so we know who saves the world while also trying to save his daughter Tessa's (Nicola Peltz) purity. Nicola Peltz is pretty but no substitution for Meagan Fox. I know. I need to move on.As expected Wahlberg does what his overpaid salary commands him to do. I am ready to walk out of the theater and then...they decided to do the same movie all over again in freaking China. I really did like the added family drama and not simply making this a metal on metal movie, but apparently Michael Bay has a brother in the salvage metal business and turned this into an over extended bot contest.The one guy with decent lines gets killed off early. No sense entertaining us with witty dialogue, as that might take away from the mindless special effects. The film was way too long for m"

" Burt Reynolds couldn't save this movie.
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,3,"Ok, yes he could. There is no movie unsaveable by Burt Reynolds, but he'd actually have to try. Most movies he could just phone in and make amazing."
" Simply though to go through
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,3,"The first bit of the movie were ""so-so"", but I could maybe, maybe buy into that. Even though I thought it were already a bit over the top and incoherent with the story.But very soon, everything goes sideways. There is generally no storyline, no actual plot. The dialogue in the movie is very poor and has no real depth to it. In the previous Transformer movies, they have managed to also have some fun dialogue, but if they are in this movie, I totally missed them.The movie tries to save itself with alot of action, but sadly its not very good or memorable. And the particleeffects looks aweful and poorly implementet.
Also the movie is packed with product-placement, I don't mind some product placement, as it can make a movie look more ""real-world"". But here it's over the top and only an attempt to finance a bad movie, from an otherwise good franchise.The last 1½ hour or so, were nothing but action, but without coherency and without that plot I mentioned, well it is just wasted screentime.
I could not watch this movie in one sitting, and even during my second sitting, I simply did not manage to watch the last 15 min. or so. 
Fair enough, you might not fall asleep to this movie, but it has nothing else going for it."
" Not a masterpiece, but not horrible
",2018-07-08 00:00:00,7,"Alright, alright, this is not the best movie ever made, but it's way better than some people give it credit for.
But genre-wise it's a weird movie.
There's action, drama, sci-fi, an occasional bit of comedy and a truckload of product placement, notice all the supercars. Of course it's supercars and not regular everyday cars, which in my opinion would make much more sense.
Also keep an eye out for the 2001 Cadillac Cien concept car, it makes a very brief appearance. It still looks brand new, though it were 13 years old at the time.I don't know if you'll like this movie or not, I guess it depends on what you compare it with.But if you have two and 2 hours and 45 minutes then you could watch this movie.
Just be prepared for a lot of GCI."
" Embarrasing to watch
",2018-06-14 00:00:00,4,"Yes, we know Transformers movies aren't great, but even as someone who can appreciate 1 and 2, this number 4 is just horrible.
You'd think Bay would listen a bit to what people have to say about the first 3 movies and take that into account but no. Or maybe he did and somehow managed to enhance everything that was wrong with the previous movies and crank it into one movie. 
The most generic actors you can get (yes, even you poor Mark, Texan overprotective father), the CGI isn't as good as it used to be, probably because they're trying too hard to make original looking stuff. And remember Sam's parents being embarrassing for 5 minutes? Well, in this movie, the Mark manages to be embarrassing through the entire movie. You want to see a father tell his super hot 17 years old daughter she can't have a boyfriend, in the middle of a fight for their lives? Yep, that's how low it sinks. Do yourself a favor and skip this, and if you really need to watch robots punch each other, go watch Transformers 1 or Pacific Rim."
" extinction promised and delivered
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,3,"I am a huge fan of the Transformers, been that since I was a kid back in the 80s, I loved the movies too, but this movie ruined just about everything I hoped and liked about them. Too much on all and any level. Too many explosions, too much of a mess, too much talking, too much dialogue gone wrong, too much product placement, too many unlikeable heros. Mark Wahlberg is mediocre, to say the least, you couldn´t care less about his daughter, Tessa,and Shane. Repulsively conservative world view, too martial, Bumblebee either behaving like a teenager or an oversized bodyguard of humans he has never met before, being handled by random humans like a slave, no bonding, no character evolving, no connection, no chemistry, utter ruin. Plot holes everywhere. Shane fastening his seat belt in the middle of devastation, which takes place in China for no reason whatsoever, just to please the crowds. The legend called Optimus Prime, looking like a robot on steroids delivering the one cheesy line after another, ending the kill of Lockdown with the words ""honor to the end"" and then ""defend this family, defend...what they can be"" without providing a single reason and any answer on the reasonable question: Why?! Ratchet has practically been slaughtered, he himself, Optimus, was more than once almost taken out by these same humans and ""what they can be"", he has stated that he is done with humans and Earth but now all of a sudden, having killed Lockdown, the sky is blue again and his creators would be well advised to ""leave Earth alone, for he is coming for them"". Optimus, the leader of leaders, is bipolar or something? Why should anyone care about the Yeagers or any human whatsoever? Then the Dinobots degraded to pets chewing on highly advanced robots, which by the way can disassemble and reassemble themselves anytime on a molecular / particles-whirling-in-the-air level, but are exactly that easily stabbed, beheaded, shot at, dismembered and chewed upon by just about anything. Then the product placement which has here gone to extremes. Then random new Autobots out of nowhere, no justification, no plot involvement, just guns and random explosions all over the place. Then Galvatron or Megatron reincarnated complaining around with a high pitched voice calling to ""his brothers"" that they find him ""that Seed"" and having no share in the story whatsoever other than a few explosions and a lot of ruin ""his brothers looking for the Seeeeeeed"" cause. Then Galvatron disappearing just as easily with the words ""we will meet again, Prime"". Seriously? That is the all-powerful Megatron reincarnated? What are you? 12 years old? It is supposed to be Megatron for crying outloud. I could go on forever and it would not change a thing. This review is the exact same mess the film was. What a disappointment! 3 stars for the very nice rendition of a very virile independent Lockdown and the Dinobots randomly ruining anything in their pass (but unable to coordinate their own movements...anyhow, I am done here too)."
" Addition Of Wahlberg Still Does Not Save This Movie
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,6,"I have seen all of the Transformers film and this has to be one of the lowest in the franchise. The addition of Mark Wahlberg to boost star power was a nice touch but certainly did not save the film. His character is an inventor, witty, comical, hell bent on protecting his daughter. TJ Miller was a nice nugget until he bowed out so early in the film. 
It was a nice caveat that we saw Kelsey Grammer as the antagonist in the film as a defiant and power hungry CIA director. The continuity of the film kept with the franchise story but most of the autoboots are gone. Special effects as always drove the film to a higher rating. I wasn't in complete disappointment but as far as the franchise goes this laid an egg. There is action and some well thought out dialogue, firey scenes with the bots. Afternoon filler."
" You'll forget about it after a good night's sleep and, honestly, that might not be a bad thing.
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,4,"'Transformers: Age Of Extinction (2014)' is not awful but, just when you think it's been a while since anything stupid happened, the film will throw a racial stereotype or an inappropriate joke (some about statutory rape, no less) or an egregious one-liner or a blatant sequel-bait or an incomprehensible plot-point your way and you'll be reminded of the sobering fact that you are indeed watching the fourth Michael Bay 'Transformers' film. The fourth in a franchise showing no signs of slowing, though relegated to spin-offs it may now be. The picture is just about serviceable in the sense that it didn't anger me, but it is also just plain bland and instantly forgettable. It is also far too long and seems to be making itself up as it goes along. It's the kind of movie that you struggle to remember after a good night's sleep and, honestly, one that you probably don't want to. 4/10"
" People have to stop driving on the Bay Hate Train
",2018-03-01 00:00:00,7,"Admittably, the Transformers Franchise got worse with every movie since its really interesting first one. But Age of Extinction has to be seen as a reset of the universe. It got rid of most of the really cringy and annoying assets like Sam and some of the annoying perverted Transformers. It doesn't try to be very deep and interesting, the plot is simple and easy, a bit too long, yes, but at no point I got annoyed by the story. Most of the characters, especially the autobots have destinct roles, they don't have to be introduced, they're part of the team and do their job. Gelvatron has a really nice plottwist and some scenes are decently funny. The whole movie has some Logan vibes to it, of course without very deep conflict and not near as much emotion.I guess people still go into the movies and watch Transformers with some kind of expectation about a surprisingly good plot or expect that Bay suddenly changes his style from brainless explosion slaughter to something deep. But if you watch this film with no expectations, or at least want some action and good fighting for an evening with friends, you will be pleasently surprised. The film delivers exactly this, Good Action."

" One of the worst movies of 2014
",2018-01-04 00:00:00,4,"Wow. Michael bay has just made another bad movie. What kind of movie is this. A movie with so much of explosions. The reason hated this movie was because the film was too long and there was bad acting and also too much of destructions and bad CGI effects. Mark wahlberg was ok in this film. But one thing it's starts from girl walking through a street and then come to a boat flying in the air which crashes into an apartment building in Hong Kong is being shot. There is racism in this movie too. Plus by the way, No one asked for a sequel. This movie has the same problems like revenge of the fallen. But the dinobots were still my favourite from the movie. This movie is awful and I don't want to see a film like this again. 4/10"
" GD17D015 D. Turbold BS100
",2017-12-05 00:00:00,7,"Despite making a marvel of a film which is visually such a spectacular mammoth, the film's story is nearly paper thin and spills out straight from the good versus evil bottle. Sadly, I was expecting more on the story front. Echoing the sentiment that the world has had enough of Autobots, the film kicks off with the auto bots being hunted down. A broke Texan engineer, Cade Yeager is the one who lands up in trouble after he buys a broken truck which he intends to dismantle and sell off to fund his daughter Tessa's college education. My only problem with this film is its story which affects the action bits too! The drill was that the humans kept getting caught and kept getting out of it. The too-much-excitement becomes a staple after a point, when you tend to become unfeeling about it. The Hong Kong based climax probably appeases the fans of the franchise in the region, but is in my opinion a slack ending of sorts."
" Makes me sad thinking about how good these movies COULD be
",2017-11-24 00:00:00,4,"(Very minor spoilers.. I won't get into the story, but do mention a few instances or lines among the criticism.)So, I was a huge Transformers fan growing up. English isn't my mother language, but I watched Transformers without subtitles and actually learned English quite a bit before ever taking English classes in the 3rd grade, just from watching Transformers.When the first movie came around, I actually watched it several times. I absolutely loved it, seeing the Transformers and how incredibly well they had been done. Sure, the humor was there, but with Shia and the goofy family, it somewhat worked in a similar tone than whatever humor the cartoons had, yet kept the story grounded being serious enough to carry you throughout without rolling your eyes.The same can't be said about the later movies. With each iteration, I feel like the series has been pushing towards the kind of humor that Jar Jar Binks brought into the Star Wars movies. Ever since the ""twin"" autobots in Revenge of The Fallen, I've quite hated the way the transformers are depicted in general.This movie is a great example of what I mean; We do get introduced to new characters, but they are pretty much all complete humoristic caricatures of character cliché's. When the movie is having a bit more serious tone and taking itself and the story a tiny bit more seriously, it works - and reminds me why I'm even bothering to watch, but for most of the movie, it absolutely makes a joke out of itself and every character on the screen, with the exception of Optimus Prime.Even Bumblebee started off somewhat right; loyal, protective, yet having a bit more of a sense of humor. It made him different in the first movie, as he was a tiny bit more like humans, being able to crack a joke, when the rest seemed more ""alien"" and ""robot"" - not to mention serious about their task. This worked. Now all of them are depicted as jokesters and Bumblebee instead was depicted as this peevish, mischievous kid that can be provoked to act against all logic, just because someone says the car form he has taken isn't as cool as something else.I absolutely hate that.Then there's the one-liners - or whatever you'd wanna call them.. lines that are just put there to .. I don't know, bring around some supposedly powerful moment without there actually even being one.. like Nicola Peltz character suddenly asking her boyfriend ""Well are you still glad you met me?"" after doing the one heroic thing she does in the movie - and he goes ""Always""... Yet nothing in the entire movie ever suggested that he would've changed his mind or not glad about it. It served no purpose. There are several these kinds of clichés that make you roll your eyes even if you're trying to like the movie.This was actually my third attempt at watching this movie and I finally made it to the end. The idiotic humor, the forced ""heroism"" and absolutely tired cliché's that keep on repeating (overprotective father thing needs to be reminded of every 5 minutes during the entire mid part of the movie - and we all know that in the end the boyfriend is ""accepted"" for doing right. We've seen it countless times.) keeps this movie from being even OK. The CGI is again top notch and I can't even imagine how good of a movie a talented writer and director could do with this kind of production value. I'm also trying to remind myself that the humor is there for kids... but truth be told, I've seen countless Disney and pixar animation films that are way less childish and smarter about humor and the pacing, use of the humor. Here, the humor just devalues the movie and makes you not take characters or the plot seriously.I'm planning on watching the next one, Last Knight after this... I see it has got a review score even lower than this. Oh dear."
" Worst movie ever. Of all time.
",2017-11-23 00:00:00,1,"From the first 10 minutes of this films near 3 hour long running time, this has nothing but offered me a massive f*ck you to the face! The story lacks detail and heart only relying on a barrage of special effects, dumb choice of shameful dialogue and acting, useless and tiring scenes no one cares about, containing over 100 tons of product placement at every scene while explosions go off uncalled for in the background! If you have an IQ of 160! Avoid this at any particular cost!"
" Transformers: Age of Extinction
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,6,(SPOILER ALERT) Transformers: Age of Extinction was not really a bad movie. But it did take away the story beforehand and set it up with new cast members and a story that doesn't go along well from the previous films and yet was a little disappointing. But Interesting in my opinion.
" DinoBots!
",2017-09-21 00:00:00,6,"Good, enjoyable action flick!Mark Wahlberg looking tough, saving his daughter and the world.Totally not necessary to be almost three hours long though!?A sequel movie that is not afraid to make fun of itself though. One of the best lines, ""Man, I hate sequels they always suck and never do as good as the first."" Bonus points for self deprecation!Worth a rental - but forewarning it's a three hour tour."
" Uninteresting pile of garbage
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,2,"So after the previous Transformer movies we could expect the worst here but for some reason we got sucked in again. This time because of the promise of Dinobots, and be honest, who doesn't think the Dinobots are cool?! What a disappointment this whole movie became! The story is very unbelievable and although there are metallic robotic dino's, they were just dino's and not saying ""Me Grimlock"". It becomes very obvious this is all product placement and pandering up to audiences in China. And worse, a large portion of the movie us a discussion about underage sex and trying to normalize it. Why? We want to see an action movie with dinorobot's and not some sexual fantasies from the director. Also the end is completely unbelievable: the evil robot owns Optimus and the other Autobots but then 3 humans step in and kick the robot's ass. I mean come on, I understand they need to shoehorn humans in but like this? No way! This is one of the few movies I played with my smartphone for a long time because I was bored out of my mind so avoid this one!"
" Pretty good
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,6,"This movie was pretty good. Especially compared to the previous ""Dark of the Moon"" installment. There was a lot of action and a lot of transforming robots, as always. The story was good enough, I enjoyed watching this film. I will say that hearing Optimus Prime threatening to kill someone every 5 minutes was a little jarring. Not because they didn't deserve it or because I'm a pacifist, but because it is totally out of character. Also, the animation for the ""new"" transformers transforming process is not good... First, the animation is glitchy sometimes. Second, it is more like ""magic happens"" then getting to watch a vehicle morph into a robot. It just is not appealing. Aside from these minor details, the movie was entertaining and I would recommend watching it if you are a fan of transformers."
" Worst Transformers movie in the franchise.
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,2,"I am a huge Transformers fan and absolutely loved the first three movies. After the first one my brother and I even followed on with some of the old TV series Transformers from DVDs we had bought and later on Transformers Prime.With the first three movies there was consistency with actors, characters and story-lines. You could make clear connections from one movie to the other and you could understand the plot. The Autobots were badass and you recognized them by their personalities, and by the vehicles they transformed into. Human interaction wasn't weird and it seemed that both robots and human beings had a mutual respect for each other.Age of Extinction completely destroyed the Transformers franchise in my opinion. I can't remember if I first saw it in cinemas on my birthday or later on, but I can definitely remember not being impressed with it. I couldn't make the connection between the last movie and Age of Extinction and couldn't understand who the new 'bad-guy' was what his story was, where he came from, nothing. There wasn't really any substance as to why all the Autobots were being killed off either. The new actors tried their best but I must admit that I couldn't find connection with them either because they weren't the ones I grew up watching. The movie lacked charisma and to be honest the Dinobots weren't all that impressive either. For such an addition that is so important, their revelation was poorly done and the amount of time they were actually seen was very little. Throughout the entire movie, I didn't know who any of the other Autobots were except Optimus, Bee, Leadfoot, Brains and Ratchet. Overall I did not understand the plot of the movie. Full-stop. There was nothing that pulled at my heart- strings or that would leave a lasting impression. I'm a pretty big Michael Bay movie fan, but I feel that he lost the plot with this movie completely and literally. His movies are great if they're done right... This one wasn't. The only reason I gave this movie an extra star is because CGI and SFX were pretty good. You can always see improvement when it comes to movies that contain loads of CGI and SFX.As for the next movie that's coming out (The Last Knight), I don't see how it would be any better; but I might be wrong. The trailers make it look alright, but that's as far as I'm going with that. In fact I am not fascinated or impressed at all about Optimus becoming a Decepticon -if that's even the correct terminology still used. The only reason I'm going to make a note of watching it is because Anthony Hopkins is in it and he's one of my favourite actors."
" Franchise Extinction? No such luck!
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,5,"Mark Wahlberg is a definite upgrade on Shia LaBeouf, if what you're looking for is a tough, heroic presence... I also like the 'Americana' vibe of the beginning (sunsets over rolling green hills, etc). There are echoes of Ruby Ridge in a Transformers movie, and I'm impressed... but it ultimately comes to nothing. It progressively gets noisier and more cluttered, and my engagement ebbs away.The plot is pretty simple; there's some element (""Transformium"" - very creative!) that the C.I.A want to use to build new tech, and the Decepticons want control of to build an infinite robot army... so when everybody is in place, it's just one giant chase scene to decide whose hands it rests in. Fair enough. ... but why in Einstein's name must it take so long??! Two and three quarter HOURS for a Transformers movie?? That's bordering on a war crime, surely! It's like each movie is in competition with the last over how much unnecessary destruction it can wreak, and how bloated it can be.I'm in a small minority of people who like the movies more, the less robot fights they have in them... All that clanking of metal upon metal? Let's just say that I'd hate to work in a foundry! Robots beating each other up just isn't my bag. I like the alliances, the talk of honour, and the backstory... I just could do without the junkyard scraps!... but then, in the end, the sun sets as the swell of the music rises up... and I think to myself: ""Damnit Bay; you almost had me!"" He knows how to make an epic; it's just a shame that - like an eight year old boy - his idea of substance amounts to banging things together, over and over again!"
" Where the f is Shia and Fox?
",2017-08-16 00:00:00,5,"These movies have gone done hill drastically since the departures of Shia and Fox. At least Turtorro is still here! Don't get me wrong, I love giant fighting robots as much as the next guy, but these plots suck and the characters are boring. Mr Walhberg is a fine actor, but he never should have been cast for the main role in these movies."
" ""Transformers: Age of Extinction""- The continued fall of a once-promising franchise...
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,3,"I'm going to be perfectly upfront in admitting that I actually really enjoyed Michael Bay's first entry in the ""Transformers"" saga upon initial release in 2007, and I still maintain that it's a solid and entertaining work. It's not a great film by any means, but it's got a certain charm to its humor and it's wildly thrilling thanks to Bay's trademark kinetic visuals and ferocious editing. It's a perfect Summer popcorn film, full of eye-popping effects that still hold up and some charming performances from the cast.Then there were the sequels. Oh, boy. I will with some shame cop to the fact that I was one of the few defenders of the second entry in the series (""Revenge of the Fallen""), though in retrospect I've come to realize the movie to be nothing more than a woefully pale imitation of what came before- only bigger, louder and a great deal dumber. This was further compounded by the third go- around (""Dark of the Moon"") which thankfully cut back on the stupidity of that second film... but still wasn't able to stand on its own thanks to its own plethora of issues with the troublesome cast (replacing series co-star Megan Fox with a vapid Victoria's Secret model being particularly mind-numbing) and an over-bloated run-time. Needless to say, by the time the credits rolled on that third movie, I was pretty much done. And I ended up deciding that I was content with merely revisiting the first movie while ignoring everything that came after.But unfortunately for me, curiosity reared its ugly head, and I ended up popping on the fourth movie, ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"", about a year back for laughs. I figured with a few beers in me and a couple friends to joke around with, it might be worth checking out once. But, yeah... it's a complete and utter mess. A confused, bloated, boring and shockingly hard-to-follow dumpster fire of a film. And it sadly signals the biggest step-down in quality of the franchise thus-far. Trading in those belly-laughs and genuine gasps of excitement that the 2007 film specialized in... and instead delivering consistent groans of disbelief and annoyance.The film has no coherent plot to speak up, and instead is comprised of a writhing mass of tenuously connected ""story-lines"" that don't really mesh together all that well. I watched the film... I really did. And I can't remember a darned thing about it outside of the brain- destroying action and obnoxiously loud sound effects. It's something about how the Transformers are all being hunted down, and Optimus Prime ends up becoming entangled with a single father played by Mark Whalberg? And at the same time, some weird tech-genius CEO is ""cloning"" Transformers for military application? And there's this weird Transformer Bounty Hunter who is somehow in league with the military despite the military supposedly hunting down the Transformers? And somewhere in there, there's Dino-Bots and a random Doomsday- Weapon peppered in? And the opening implies that the Transformers have been around even longer than previously thought? And about a million other things are going on as well? You'd need enough Ritalin to kill a horse in order to understand what's going on in this movie.But maybe you don't care about the plot or the characters, and you're just interesting in explosive action and crazy visual effects. After all, that's what these movies are all about, right? Well, even on that front, this film feels bizarrely underwhelming, and it's just kind of dull and monotonous. Not only have the computer-generated effects not improved since the third film- they look like they've taken a step back, and objectively look even worse than they did in the first movie somehow. The Transformers have that weird plastic-y look to them that comes with bad rendering, and the animation is way too smooth, making them look more akin to Looney Tunes than real-life robots in disguise. I was half expecting Optimus to dig himself to Albuquerque by the time the film ended... And the action is so overdone that it loses all impact. The first film was so clever in how it built up to its explosive climax. This one just basically throws everything at the lens possible as often as it can, and it completely desensitizes the audience. You can't go so excessive so often, or else it loses meaning.And don't even get me started on the downright creepy and unsettling ""Romeo and Juliet Law"" subplot the film likes to throw in your face constantly. Yeah, the film has several scenes dedicated to the fact that the protagonist's 17-year-old daughter is dating a 20-year-old after they met in High School. OK, whatever, it happens I guess. But the movie doesn't just let it go... it reminds us of this fact way too often and goes into long-winded spiels about how it's ""totally legal"", and it becomes really unsettling really quickly. It feels less like the movie trying to set up conflict... and more like Michael Bay trying to explain why he thinks it's OK to objectify young women. It's really gross how much the film is obsessed with this minute plot- point.If there's one thing I can say to the film's credit, it's that Whalberg is a very likable and charismatic actor, and he's a good replacement for previous star Shia LaBeouf. And yeah, you do still care about the returning Autobots, simply because we've come to enjoy them after three previous films. But that's really all the film has going for it... The rest of the film is just a messy re-skin of what came before, but made way more convoluted and pointless by the needlessly excessive carnage, ridiculous script and creepy subtext. And for that, I give it a very poor 3 out of 10. Just stick with the first movie, folks. That's the only one that matters."

",2017-07-15 00:00:00,1,"At first I tried to give this movie a chance because Mark Wahlberg seems like a really nice guy and seems like a chill celebrity.But after watching the first 10 minutes,I felt like I was being punished and had to watch this terrible movie for 3 hours which felt like 10 years.Two of my least favorite characters are the daughter of Mark Wahlberg's character and her boyfriend who Wahlberg's character hates because he is 21 and she is 17,and how their relationship is illegal is dragged on for the entire movie.And I'm starting to know why it had a big budget,it was because of all the product placement in the movie.And I have to stop there because I can write a novel of how terrible this movie is."
" The 4th one is better then the 2nd one
",2017-07-14 00:00:00,9,This a great movie It is better then Transformers revenge of the fallen. And that is not easy to do. The first movie of Transformers is better. Transformers dark of the moon is also better. Transformers the last knight is also better. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. It is very fast past. This a great movie. 5.7 is a good ratting. But this such a great movie that 5.7 is underrating it. This is an 8. Not a 5.7. This is so such better then The fast and Furious. This is better then Suicide squad. And that is not easy to do.
" I liked it better than third, but still not very good
",2017-07-10 00:00:00,5,"It saddens me how poorly the Transformers franchise has gone after such a great start with the first film. In that one they hooked you right in with the helicopter attack. The second film was a bloated mess, the third was just too much Shia for my tastes. This one, Shia and his annoying parents are gone (they were okay in the first film, but their comedy got tiresome quickly) and we get an inventor and his daughter and boyfriend because we just have to jam these films in with so many subplots involving the humans that at times you forget these are Transformers films! The cartoon which was used to sell toys had better stories than these films and the movie certainly did! The action in this one is rather good and there are still some cool scenes, but nothing like the opening scene in the first Transformers live action film and certainly nothing as totally awesome as Optimus Prime totally kicking butt in the animated film. In these films, humans have to save the day, and not super humans either, just everyday people that would die within a minute of the blasts going off all around them.The story has a backlash against both Autobots and Decepticons due to the attack on Chicago where if the Autobots had not returned the Decepticons would have brought Cybertron into our atmosphere and used humans as slaves, but apparently everyone forgot that the Autobots saved the day. Well we have evil humans hunting down the robots with another robot which makes no sense, but hey, when does plot matter in these films. Meanwhile, Optimus is in hiding, apparently he took some bad damage from an ambush. Only the Autobots can restore his health or not, not to clear on how he simply got himself back together. Some inventor guy is making his own Transformers that fly apart when transforming and creates Galvatron who turns into a semi like Prime; meanwhile, Lockdown, the robot working with the humans to track down the transformers can turn himself into a cannon which is what Galvatron turns into in the comics. So they apparently cannot do Megatron right the entire series, but then make a random made up robot turn into something Megatron/Galvatron turns into...there is more, but the film ends exactly like the others with a big fight in a city, this time Hong Kong, my guess to kiss the butt of the Chinese so it will do good over there.I liked the Autobots in this one as they were actually kind of distinct. Loved Hound and the one that was like a samurai. Galvatron is pretty much a non factor during the last portion of the film, which is pretty much how Megatron was in the previous film, though at least in that one he got a shot in. The movie is all over the place, there is some good action in it, but the story is a convoluted mess beyond explanation. Apparently, it is the most difficult thing in the world to make a Transformers film where good versus evil, so lets add evil CIA agents, strange inventors that suddenly become important, a whole plot about some creators wanting Prime and a whole slew of subplots about dating and being able to drive! It is just a mess as far as story and the movie is so long! So, this film had its moments, simplify the plot and cut the running time down and it would be more passable. As is it is a bloated mess as far as plot. Then there are moments that make one scratch their head. Like I understand the boyfriend coming in and driving his car during the scene near the beginning with the agents, but at the end of the film they get into a broken down heap and he drives the important device rather than them driving in one of the Autobots. Also, the whole plot where they turn on the Autobots is just stupid especially considering they want to work with another Transformer in Lockdown. Just a lot of crazy stuff going on and then you have the agents who have lost desperate to just kill the good guys; however, why they are in a rush is beyond me. They could just stay in hiding and when everything cools down they can go kill them. Like I said, better than the third, but none of them have the feel the first film had. This franchise should probably be stopped for a while and perhaps rebooted ten or more years down the line."
" Transformers: Age of Extinction is the most boring movie I have ever seen
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,3,"I'm a pretty big action fan, but I still expect more from entertainment. I expect good characters, a decent plot, and good action sequences. This film has none of that. This movie is a nearly 3 hour long un-fun, boring turd fest that couldn't keep my interest for even 5 minutes. It's plot is all over the place, it has unfunny humor, confusing action scenes, awful characters, lukewarm acting, and a TON of product placement. It's like every 2 minutes it cuts to a commercial. Of course, I rented it, but it still wasted my time. Overall, don't watch it. Heck, don't even rent it. It's not worth your time or money."
" Disappointing
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,5,"By far the most disappointing movie of the 5 transformers films. Nowhere near as exciting as the other 4, too damn long approaches 3 hours long with 2/3 of he movie focusing on human nonsense. When the transformers are on screen though, it's action packed, exciting and explosive. Unfortunately it's rare that you see a transformer in action in this movie making a lot of appearances it not fighting for a while up until the end where the action definitely picks up. But my least favorite of the franchise."
" A goofy action film with dazzling special effects but poor dialogue and ridiculous plotting
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,3,"The fourth movie in the Transformers series delves even further into Earth's history and introduces a new main character. Michael Bay continues his unique style of action spectacle directing though the target audience appears to be more international. Before humanity, the Transformers visited and wiped out dinosaurs. A discovery in Artic by the explorer Darcy (Sophia Myles) shows signs of their early presence. In Texas, Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) discovers a strange truck while salvaging junk from a movie theater with his assistant Lucas (T.J. Miller). Cade's daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) can't get a scholarship to college and the family is in financial trouble. In Chicago, Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammar) coordinates an operation that sends a task force to hunt down Transformers led by James Savoy (Titus Welliver). The transformer they cooperate with, Lockdown, does not discriminate between Autobots and Decepticons.Cade discovers the truck is actually Optimus Prime who had been trapped by humans and forced into hiding. Attinger sends Savoy and the Transformer hunters to Texas to investigate the truck sighting. They use brutal tactics on the Yeagers until Optimus bursts out of the barn and Shane Dyson (Jack Reynor), Tessa's boyfriend, drives in to help them escape. In the ensuing chase, Shane shows off his driving skills and Lucas gets vaporized. Cade does not approve of Shane dating Tessa and investigates the BlackOps organization that attacked him. Optimus updates his look and assembles the remaining autobots, including Bumblebee. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
" Transformers Age of Extinction movie.
",2017-06-24 00:00:00,3,"Although I did not have much interest in it, I actually thought I would give it a chance. I think the selling point for me was having Mark Wahlberg headlining. Now let me be clear about this: he is an acceptable actor, however much of the movies he does are not very good or not very interesting. It could either be the way his characters are written or the way he portrays them or could just be the movie itself. This one is up there as one of my least favorites. I tried getting invested in the beginning setup, but at the forty, forty-five-minute mark, I realized there wasn't much to hold on to. What little story there is, I can't even really remember it without having to look up a synopsis. It wouldn't matter. I could care less one way or the other. I suppose the action scenes are OK. There may have been an annoying side character or two, but nothing to get too upset about. There wasn't anything I was really bothered by. Generally, I found it bland, gimmicky and lightweight. I mostly just remember the feeling it gave me towards the end when the battle sequences were endless in like the last hour of the movie (it's long at 2 hours and 45 minutes). There I was watching it. About an hour and a half had gone by, at which point I already found it to be a sub-par action movie. I could see there being two battle scenes in the end at the most, but there were 3, 4, 5, maybe 6 battle scenes. It was never-ending. The first ending battle scene I thought okay. Then I thought all right maybe that wasn't the finale. Then I was like, this has to be the last, right? Then, it isn't over, still?! It is just so much, although it isn't as bad as Revenge of the Fallen, which stands as one of the worst movies of all time. I am sure there are these bloated action scenes made because it's expected to be a summer blockbuster. That has got to be what goes on in the minds of the people behind it; make it bigger, louder and more explosive because it's set as summer escapism. They wouldn't think of releasing these movies during Oscar season. It is especially likely these movies aren't remembered by the end of the year anyhow."
" Bad worst part
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,1,"I loved the 1st 3 parts, but this is the worst part. i hope the 5th part will be better we wanna Ironhide and the kid in the 1st three parts i didn't like this part i'm sorry, but what the problem of you guys it's too stupid to make this bad Affects you just wanna money from the Chinese"
" awful walhberg
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,1,"so it wasn't,t enough to kill the franchise , now we have to watch another Transformer (The last knight) with AGAIN the same awful acting in this case Walberg, it's a shame, the movie was OK, just that and that's for the other actors (except walberg and the boyfriend) the FX, and all the people who worked in this movie...it's a Shame that u have to call Anthony Hopkins call back Duhamel to try to make a good movie of a Flop,he can't do nothing if the lead actor is AWFUL, you had so many good actors, SF great actors, you had to choose the BURGER one6 really?, I am not going to waste my time seeing another atrocity....I am so SAD, I missed, Turtorro, Shia Leboeuf, Megan Fox, I bought the first transformers, I never bought the Walburger ones...I prefer to remember the great ones, than being deceived again."
" Cheese and Crackers
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,3,"This movie made me hate babies.But, somehow I remember it. It's a mystery how. There may or may not be a plot to this movie. I don't know it's ambiguous. The last 40 minutes are things blowing up and the robots occasionally shouting something offensive. Never thought I'd get bored of explosions.Marky Mark tries his very hardest. Stanley Tucci is kind of cool at first, then becomes a little too goofy and cheesy. Kelsey Grammar is in this. The characters are mostly poop. Optimus Prime is not himself. Marky Mark tries to be likable. He sort of succeeds. I hated his daughter. Her boyfriend is even worse. There is a scene near the end where he almost died and I thought to myself: ""If he dies, this movie will go from a '3' to a '5'."" Sadly, he lived. The villain, Lockdown, was kind of cool, he actually had presence and was imposing.This movie sucks. I went into it with a turn off your brain, just give me robot-on-robot fighting. Did not even get that."
" Makes the Transformers movie series deeper and more complex
",2017-06-01 00:00:00,8,"This film truly repaired (almost everything) what we hated about the first three actions.Bad: We are introduced to three new Auto-bots (Hound, Drift, and Crosshairs) who really show up with the only backstories being on the back of their toy boxes. The 4 dinosaur robots, without any true names (we fans know their names, but the those are not the fans do not) appear in the film serving as Dues Ex Machina. Some racist stereotypes still exist and Tessa was really not that far off, have you seen some the girls in real life, I'm not sexist, but I know a lot a girls dress with mini shorts (and some men walk around shirtless, or with a half naked girl on their shirts) The blood (energon) of the transformers is on a continuity error, since in 2 and 3 the color had an orange color now to a green color such as when part Prime's head fell off and green stuff splattered out vs. Megatron's blood when he was killed.Good: The movie does not suddenly involve Unicron (I hope they never bring him into the series he was not really a good idea in the original series being that he was killed his first appearance and showed up as a head and in a reference in the Beast Wars and was compared to Predacon Megatron's Ship) or does anything else that would appeal to fans only.Establishes a deeper past into the Transformers relations to humans. Continues to develop the movie Optimus Prime making him aggressive to humans, and the Rachet's and Leadfoot's deaths were actually taken hard by the Autobot crew. All the Cybertronion transformers are given personalities, I say that because excepting Galvatron the prototypes were just goons being controlled by the other baddie. There are three antagonists in this film, all with different goals.Improvements: The racist comments from the first 3 were put on a minimum where the only that movie could offend people is if they took extreme pride in being Irish.Best: Perfectly makes human-transformers relationships more realistic where now there are actually teams of ex. military hunting down the transformers. All main characters are given a goal and a personality,Antagonists: Attinger: not wanting any more innocent deaths that are caused by the battles of the transformers. Lockdown: just an alien bounty hunter with a grudge against the Autobots and Decepticons, since they are always starting wars against each other. Protagonists: Optimus Prime: his aggressiveness is now at a peak, which the comic lovers know where it started(hatch lings)who is really angry at the humans who suddenly turned their backs on the Autobots (I will do a deeper analysis on Prime on my twitter page, KadDaws) Cade: a single poor father trying to do the best for his daughter, and unintentionally gets involved into an alien civil war."
" This is the first movie I seen where I literally walked out of the theaters
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,1,"Sorry for the late review, but I remember going to the movies with this girl I knew at the time and at first we were gonna see Tammy starring Melissa McCarthy but the tickets were either sold out or we were too late for the showing. So we decided to see Transformers 4 Age of ExSTINKtion, and man when I tell this movie was awful, it was painful to sit through. The movie was too long, from what i can remember, the action was stupid, the jokes fell flat, and we didn't even sit through the whole movie, we just walked out. I really enjoyed the first movie a lot, the sequels are just awful. I give this movie a F-, 1 0ut of 10 stars."
" Better the second time
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,6,"I've been playing with Transformer toys since the beginning, loved the cartoon series and animated movie, but have mostly loathed what Michael Bay has done to my beloved franchise. His first movie was decent, the second appalling, the third passable, and when I left the movie theater after watching this fourth installment, my general feeling was, ""Whatever."" Being a little hard of hearing, I couldn't hear much of the dialog and was seriously confused about what was going on (not that Mr. Bay seems to worry much about telling a coherent story). I had been meaning to get back around to seeing it again at home where I could watch it with subtitles, and I was finally able to do just that. This time, I paid very close attention to try to understand the story and was rather surprised to discover that there was a very nice story that played out in a relatively orderly and logical manner, but with enough unanswered questions to leave you wondering where they might take the story in subsequent installments. Being all too familiar with Michael Bay's brand of humor and obsession with never-ending battle sequences, I had adjusted my expectation and found myself, overall, quite enjoying the film. I liked (or at least, didn't hate) many of the characters, including the main actors. There were also some very cool transformations and special effects. My main gripe with the movie (and I still have many of them) is that Michael Bay just doesn't know when to quit - this movie is entirely too long. He's made the same mistake before. The action sequences are so frequent and so long that I end up getting simultaneously bored and traumatized (never imagined that would be possible). If he could just scale back on the incessant action and ridiculous humor, I might start to actually form a moderately positive opinion of him - but I continue to hope that they'll hand the directing reins to someone (pretty much anyone) else."
" Butt hurt comment on reviews. Sorry not sorry.
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,10,"I'm just going to say that this movie was actually really good. If a Transformers ""fan"" out there claims this movie was bad, then obviously they aren't too much of a fan of the series. If you actually think this movie is bad, you should go watch Spongebob again, because action movies aren't for you. I've watched this movie more times than I can count and I must say to see many reviews trash talk it makes me sad. How are you going to say it's ""awful"" or ""the worst of the series""? Then tell others to save their money? Maybe they'll like it. Telling people not to watch it is honestly silly. Some people like different things. Yes it's your opinion, yes it's a review of the movie and your thoughts but really? Give your opinion, but never assume people won't like it."
" Wow.
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,10,"There are no words. I have been at the theater on opening night for every Transformers movie, and this one is no different. There is no activity more engaging than spending three hours of my life staring open-mouthed at aggressively CGI-ed visual stimulus with little substance and no attempt at development to speak of. Although uneducated moviegoers‒‒unlike myself, who can boast a film repertoire including some of my favorite modern masterpieces such as the Avengers series and Independence Day: Resurgence‒‒may view this kind of experience as ""unsatisfying,"" or a ""general waste,"" there is nothing I personally enjoy more than films with pore-established stories and characters that don't require clever storytelling to introduce and reveal through good direction and a well-written screenplay. That way, I don't really have to pay attention to the boring social commentary between the empty action that I'm spending my hard-earned money to see.Transformers: Age of Extinction undoubtedly deserves Best Picture this year‒‒it was exactly what I look for in movies; I can't wait to bring the kids to see it tomorrow‒‒but if that doesn't work out, at least I know I can count on it at least getting Best Makeup."

" Not Nearly As Fun As The Original Trilogy
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,3,"As long as human beings enjoy grabbing a large bucket of popcorn, a soft drink, and settling into their theater seat, there will be a market for ""Transformers"" movies, as they are the very essence of escapist cinema. What the original ""Transformers"" trilogy had going for it, though, was the fact that is was also just so much doggone fun! I am often viewed as a somewhat pretentious movie-watcher (liking films that make me think/feel), yet I liked all three previous films in this series while friends who were much more casual viewers fell away. I guess I just liked how much FUN it was to kick back and watch them! With ""Age of Extinction"", however, the serious tone throughout completely destroys any opportunity for fun. This is all robotics and family issues and government corruption. No time for levity whatsoever.For a basic plot summary (some spoilers), ""Age of Extinction"" sees inventor (junk dealer?) Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) and his daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) find the long-lost Optimus Prime after the Chicago Wars of previous films. By this time, a shadow sect inside the government (led by Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammar)) has partnered with a robotics company/laboratory (led by Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci)) in order to create Transformers...thus rendering Optimus and his original crew obsolete and thus expendable. Predictably, the plan goes haywire and a giant battle ensues...this time featuring Dino-Bots!There are two main issues with this movie that made it a disappointing experience for me:1. I still found myself marveling at some of the robot battle scenes, but this time there is no levity whatsoever. A two-and-a-half hour film cannot be whirling robot parts and explosions 24/7 (despite director Michael Bay's probable contrary views!). There needs to be some down time for character development and humor to create a balance. This film had no of that. Whereas the interplay between Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox was so dead-on and relatable to its target audience, this one is stereotyped and about as cardboard as a script can get. The characters never develop, the humor is forced a large portion of the time, and thus this movie is utterly vacant beyond the Transformers themselves.Also on this note, I think that LaBeouf's absence is the biggest downfall. Say what you want (and one could say plenty) about LaBeouf's personal life these days, but in my mind he MADE the ""Transformers"" franchise. Without his hyper-kinetic energy, many scenes just fall flat.2. This movie is WAAAAAAAAY too long. Chop off the last 45 minutes, and I'd probably bump it up a whole star rating. The last segment, though, is just about as bloated and un-inspiring as a film ending can get. I actually began wishing that the movie would just end, but instead was ""treated"" to battle after battle seemingly without end. As I said earlier, had earlier portions of the film balanced things out a bit better, maybe this type of ending wouldn't have seemed so over- the-top. As it was, though, it just dragged on, and on, and on.Overall, I have a hard time believing that Steven Spielberg's name is still attached to this iteration of the franchise. He doesn't get involved with too many stinkers, but this is one of them. I can't guarantee that I won't view the inevitable next movie in the franchise, but I can with 100% certainty say this: I will likely never again be ""really, really excited"" to see a ""Transformers"" flick. That ship (sadly) has now sailed."

If you want brainless entertainment go see this one. The film is what it's supposed to be, a real blockbuster made to make money out of it, nothing more nothing less.Decide for yourself if you want to go watch this. I respect every filmmaker and I'm the last one to bash on someone's work.Great entertainment, great graphics, maybe a half an hour to long but nonetheless not a waste of my money."
" Bring New Life to the Franchise? EPIC FAIL!!!
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,3,"Ever since the perfectly fun first movie, the Transformers franchise has gone downhill extremely fast. This film was Michael Bay's attempt to resurrect the series. While I didn't see this film in the theater, I still had a small amount of hope for the movie. Watched it on TV and, holy mackerel, this movie was HORRIBLE!!!In my opinion, after this ATROCITY, the series is all but dead. Let's dive into this masterpiece of failure.The story of the film is that the Transformers are now being hunted down. Apparently, a new Bounty Hunter has taken control of the humans trust, and the Autobots are in dire need of help. Ironically, Optimus Prime turns to mechanic Cade Yeager, played by Mark Wahlberg, his daughter Tessa, played by Nicola Peltz, and her boyfriend. The story of the film is okay, but the writing and dialogue is about average. The characters are either hit or miss. The only characters I like are Cade Yeager and a new Transformer played by John Goodman. Most of the new characters are awful. As is the fact that only Bumblebee and Optimus are the only returning classic Transformers. The new ones are very unforgettable.One of the biggest negatives I had with the movie comes down to anticipation. Specifically, my anticipation to see the Dinobots in action. This was DESTROYED! The Dinobots are only in the last 30 minutes of this almost 3 HOUR MOVIE! That's right, the movie is almost 3 HOURS LONG! All the movie is is explosions, CGI, and Michael Bay stereotypes jammed down our throat! I didn't like it at all.In conclusion, Transformers Age of Extinction is an absolute waste of time! The characters are unforgettable, the story is average, and the special effects are unbearable, as the film is trying to rely on explosions and CGI. If you're going to watch a Transformers movie, only watch the first movie. That is a legitimately great movie. This film, while not the worst (that is Revenge of the Fallen), is still VERY VERY BAD!!! Transformers Age of Extinction gets a 4/10! Nothing will convince me that Transformers The Last Knight will be good!"
" The worst big budget movie i have ever seen
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,1,"Of the hundreds of movies I've seen, there are only two or three i just couldn't make it to the end of. Transformers 4 wins the award for being the only one from a prominent studio. It is possible that the final act contains something worth watching. Perhaps they all have an orgy. Maby they break into song. They could all roll into Michael Bay's office and ask him what the hell he was thinking. My money is on more of the same agonizing uninteresting 'action'.It's just not fun to watch. I've always thought the Transformers looked a bit silly in the movies. They lack the weight and solidness you'd expect from hulking robots but at least the first three movies had something of a plot, even a Michael Bay plot. No luck here.Just a mess of crap cg with some of the most blatant product placement I've seen."
