" Profound
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,9,"Absolutely stunning images from photographer Sebastião Salgado, and a documentary that informs us of not only of his fascinating life and travels, but also something deeper and disturbing about mankind that we all would probably rather not think too much about. It had me in that opening sequence at a gold mine in Brazil, with extraordinary images and these lines from Salgado:""When I reached the edge of that enormous hole every hair on my body stood on end. I'd never seen anything like it. Here, in a split second, I saw unfolding before me the history of mankind. The building of the pyramids, the Tower of Babel, the mines of King Solomon. Not the sound of a single machine could be heard. All you could hear was the babble of 50,000 people in one huge hole. Conversations, noises, human sounds mingled with the sounds of manual labor. I had returned to the dawn of time. I could almost hear the gold whispering in the souls of these men.""Throughout the film, the photographer's comments are brilliant, adding not just context but amplifying the humanism or despair of the images he captured. We see native peoples hidden deep in the continents of South America and Africa, the struggles of the working class and refugees, the hellscape of Kuwait during the first Gulf War, and genocide and famine in Africa. Beware, there are many, many images which are truly horrifying and depressing, leading Salgado to lose all faith in mankind, saying:""We are a ferocious animal. We humans are terrible animals. Here in Europe, in Africa, in South America, everywhere, we are extremely violent. Our history is a history of wars. It's an endless story, a story of repression, a tale of madness."" And then later: ""When I left there (Rwanda), I no longer believed in anything, in any salvation for the human species. You couldn't survive such a thing. We didn't deserve to live. No one deserved to live. How many times did I lay my camera down to cry over what I'd seen?""Balancing this out a bit are fantastic photographs of wildlife, and the heartwarming re-planting of a forest in Brazil. Salgado not only muses over the longevity and power of the trees, noting that the little sprouts he's holding may live 400-500 years, but also the oneness of all living things. It's a deeply profound, moving work, and I thought director Wim Wenders did a great job framing it all, incorporating a great soundtrack, and then remaining for the most part in the background to let Salgado speak through his extraordinary life experiences and photos. This is one to seek out."
" Most Powerful
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,10,"Everything in this documentary is moving and over-whelming. The dialogue, the events described, and the photographs of Sebastião Salgado. He traveled the world and encountered so many varieties of the human experience. A very unique testament to the human condition."
" This is not a Wim Wenders film !
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,9,"This is a documentary from exceptional Salgado
who demonstrates his astounding work..This is 90% Salgado and 10% Wenders."
" Marvellous Documentary.
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,10,"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ♠The film follows 40 years of Brazilian photographer Sebastião Salgado's work from South America, to Africa, Europe, the Arctic, and back home to Brazil focusing on international conflicts, starvation and exodus, and natural landscapes in decline.Absolute Must-See."
" Human and Nature
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,9,"Humans are part of the earth like salt. But if the balance between salt and the earth is broken, suffering will come in droves. The presentation of black and white pictures makes us realize that the love of man and nature is indispensable. Believe everyone can recognize human and nature after watching it."
" Documentary about art, love and people and the world
",2020-04-07 00:00:00,10,"As soon as the film deals with the biography of one of the greatest photographers in history, it reveals his thoughts and intentions in photographing suffering people. In addition, the special and special visual style of the film is excellent."
" THE SALT OF THE EARTH is another exemplary documentary whose subject's intrinsic quiddity outweighs the filmmakers' brilliant mastery
",2020-03-26 00:00:00,8,"""Rightly, humility is one major attribute which audience can relate strongly to the artist himself, appearing as a soft-spoken, compassionate polymath with fluent French, Sebastião finally confesses, after his grueling experience of witnessing and capturing mass death (succumbed to famine, draught, diaspora, malady, or manmade weapons) firsthand on the tormented continent of Africa, he finds himself losing hope in humanity and deems that no one is not worthy living after all, the career hazard takes a heavy toll on him, and just through his works on screen, audience can vicariously fall into the nadir (if not as deep as his), an utter disillusion of mankind's raison d'être, should the film have finished at that moment, it would become a total blast to not give a toss about anything, at all.""read my review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
" A Truly Harrowing, Beautiful Tale of Tales. Unforgettable
",2020-03-15 00:00:00,10,"It was around 2 minutes into this film that I realised it was going to be one of the most important things I'd ever seen. It is. It is profound, jarring, I had to constantly stop it, mesmerised at the destruction; and the construction.. In a sense wholly Buddhist, in my limited understanding of Buddhism. If i hadn't dwelt on scenes, anyway' Scenes of utter desperation and desolation that lead to slides of beauty, hope, perseverance and regeneration. It is everything about us. Totally humane yet totally human.
I wish everyone on Earth could watch this. Everyone that needs to. Everyone needs to. Unforgettable"
" Superb Documentary...
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,10,Salgado is one of the best photographers... Absolutely worth of watching... Two thumbs up...
" A fine film
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,7,"This French-Brazilian documentary follows the life and work of photographer Sebastiao Salgado who was born in Brazil and spent much of his adult life in France .The cinematography of this film (including those of Salgado's photographs) is sharp and stunning just as the subjects of the photographs are real and disturbing. They provide a history of well known famines and wars of the past half-century.At times, the images become overwhelming. The rage and passion one feels at the start turn to numbness and withdrawal later on making it easier to understand Salgado's comments on his extreme disappointment of humankind.As the later part of the film turns to environmental causes, there is actually an optimism to help heal the pessimism felt earlier. In a practical way, the film gives us a hopeful direction that could actually work.Perhaps with less time spent on some of the images and more time spent on Salgado himself, there would have been more balance. But the film still succeeds with its good intentions."
" Only good because its using salgados photos
",2018-11-19 00:00:00,8,Half of the movie shows pictured from salgado's spectacular work. That is just amazing. The rest is not that great. You are better off looking up his photo books actually.
" An accurate documentary about Salgado's life and job
",2018-10-16 00:00:00,7,"Salgado is one of the most important and significant photographer in the world. He is also a man with a strong and complicated soul, who lived an intense life full of travels and adventures. 
This documentary is a well done and accurate movie shot by Wim Wenders with the support of Salgado's son to better know his thoughts, view of the world, method of working and experiences with humans and earth. 
I saw it after a Salgado's exhibition and he helped me to have much more information about him, entering his world. But it is also a wonderful message of hope and careness for our planet that both Salgado and Wenders want to send to people.
I appreciated it very much, although it is maybe too long and, trying to cover all his life, it touches many themes and points but only superficially. Also, the figure of Salgado remains detouched and cold, so that it is not so easy for the audience to empathize with him and with his projects. Everything is well done, but there is a general lack of emotion and fiction. 
In any case I think it is a documentary that everybody should watch."
" narcissistic
",2018-06-08 00:00:00,6,"I found the documentary a bit boring. The story about this family and his kids etc didnt make sense to me and i didnt like the scenario or wenders close up of the photographer all the time.
I found this a very narcissistic film and not a great story."
" A powerful portrait of one of the greatest photographers of our age.
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,9,"Brazilian photographer Sebastao Salgado's understanding that a portrait is an exchange between two people, his unfailing compassion and his technical skill have created some of the most memorable photographs of the last 50 years. Salgado's exhibition Exodus, dedicated to refugees, made him an observer of genocide in former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and left him haunted and defeated by the savagery of our species. But helped by his long term creative partner, his wife Lelia, the photographer went on to document the unspoiled places of our earth in Genesis, with photos of an almost hallucinatory beauty. Wim Wenders' film, a masterclass in the power of documentary simplicity, is a moving tribute to the man and his work."
" Humanistic photographer returns to basics after witnessing sufferings on earth
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,9,"Impressive! My jaws dropped, my eyes opened wide and my heart ached as I watched these stunning images taken by veteran photographer Sebastião Salgado. It hits more as he explains the background under which he took those pictures. Born in Brazil, he is more than a photographer, a photojournalist, an anthropologist, an adventurer, a loving husband and a father. He is a humanist who shows us the world through his lens and the emotions he captured and feelings awed. He is also very lucky to have a wife who supports his dream and passion. They plan and work together to build massive projects which let Sebastião away from home for lengths spanning from month to years. Looking at his pictures, we are like traveling in time and space while freezing at certain moments. The feminine, the skeletons, the piles of corpses, the hollow eyes of young refugees, the massive camps like ants against the beautiful backdrop of the African savana, the determination of a little boy who walked to flee expulsion. Then the workers, the Indians and Siberian tribe braving snow storms, the Nenets who live near the Arctic Circle and the polygamous Zo'é who wear a wood stick under their chin. Fascinating! What is valuable is Sebastião explains the situations under which he took the pictures and how the situations still haunt him or move him. The pictures are stunning. The photographer's life is equally interesting. He is so honest and humble in showing how much he cares about humankind, the earth and his own family. After witnessing the sufferings on different continents, his project came one full circle to Genesis as he explored the earth, its wildlife and untouched human civilizations as it has started from the beginning of time. We saw his humbleness towards nature and animals as he described his journey. In the end, he himself came one big circle and return to Brazil to replant trees in his father's farm which had dried out for decades. After a decade, shades re-emerged and even the jaguar returned to the forest. Sebastião was hopeful that the waterfall he saw when he was a boy would eventually return. Quite a realization after traveling around all corners of the world and starting to appreciate the very basics. I think we should all learn from him to respect nature – both the wild and human. I watched it twice in three years and I would watch it again if I have a chance. Highly recommend."
