" Reminds me of Homestuck
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,9,Pretty good. Has trolls. Solid 9/10 for troll content. Would have given it a 10/10 if there was a Homestuck reference. Oh well. Still a good flick.
" It could have been worse
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,6,I was so scared before watching this. Thought it would be the worst ever. But it wasnt really that bad. Songs are acceptable and there were some funny parts. Plot was clever. There were annoying characters but most of them were likeable. So glad it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be.
" Ownt, Cute ...
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,8,"I think I am a troll, joy, optimism, positivity, singing all the time, dancing whenever I can, lots of love involved, colors everywhere, I just skip the hug time and my fart still doesn't come out glittery ... And the graph, all fluffy, gelatinous, shiny, colorful, except in the world of Bergens, but they themselves are pessimistic, surly, moody and unhappy, they are cute, they are all adorable, they want to squeeze... ""Happiness is not something to be swallowed. is inside of you"" Ownt, Cute ..."
" A Cute Family Film
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,9,"I really enjoyed this movie. Its story was super cute, the music was great, and it had a good message about being positive. Anna Kendrick was meant to make movies like this. Her voice literally stole the show as Poppy, and I'm so happy they got her to sing in it. I never knew I needed Anna singing 'The Sound of Silence' in my life until now. Also, the characters were super cute. Poppy and Branch had great chemistry, and their character really complemented each other well. I never felt like their relationship was forced. Sure some of the jokes were for little kids. But hey, it is a kids' movie, and there were plenty of one-liners that I thought were funny. I would defiantly recommend it, especially if you have kids or just need a little positivity in your life."
" Very simple for the kids.
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,3,"Bright, Colourful, Shiny and Sparkly with Loud Music and Cute Characters. I'm pretty sure this film wasn't aimed at me as a target audience, but more the 2-3 age group who just like flashing images and music with a beat.
Credit where it's due, they did pick some great songs, but as an adult watching it, I felt that it was like the child's equivalent of 'Pitch Perfect' or 'Glee', with some elements of 'The Borrowers' and all too gimmicky. I'm glad my Niece is too old to ask for all the merchandise that accompanies the film, before it fades out like the other fads we've all seen before (Says the Uncle that forced 'Teletubbies', 'Tickle Me Elmo' and 'Barbie' on her).I do like the message that you don't need others to make you happy, because it's always there inside you. Even if it is an incredibly dumbed down message and with a very basic and over used storyline.Overall I would say that if you're looking for something to keep your toddlers happy for 87 minutes, then ignore most of what I've said above, but if you're an adult looking for a trip back to your childhood with some great adult innuendo thrown in, stick to 'Toy Story' or 'Despicable Me' instead."
" Too bad
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,1,Why does a song that is actually good have to be in a stinker like this. Watch Hamilton if need that singing in movies need satisfied.
" Terrible.... but not the worst
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,2,"Luckily I wasn't the only one that didn't like this film. Critics didn't like it, audience didn't like, I don't think it was that big a hit at the box office"
" Horrible
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,1,"I saw this four years ago in theaters and I have not seen this in a LONG time. That is because it is SO, SO awful. The plot is so terrible. It was clearly nothing but a cash-grab to sell troll toys to kids. The movie sent out some horrible messages to viewers. Also, this mess is PACKED with cliches and even has a rip-off of Cinderella for one of its subplots. It's annoying how DreamWorks wasted the talents of incredible actors, such as Justin Timberlake, Anna Kendrick, and James Corden by making them play characters in this abomination. They have so much potential and have acted in far better movies (for example, Anna Kendrick and James Corden were in Into the Woods together before doing this movie). So...yeah."
" May be giving the kids wrong impressions
",2020-11-04 00:00:00,4,"The best thing on this is the animation. On the singing, only few good songs; the others not so, due to the good vocals being overwhelmed by music edits.Guardians should guide the kids on understanding:
1. Poppy should have obtained Branch's consent on using his private space, cause that is respectful of differences in characters.
2. People do not need to be always happy. All emotions are important.
3. You do not have to dress and alter self, like Bridget did, to be liked."
" Relevant for our current world situation
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,10,"The message of tolerance, of diversity, of love, and of music radiates throughout the entire film! It will make you laugh, will make you cry, and it will make you believe in the miracle of music bringing people together! The message of learning to accept the differences in others is reflected in our current racial atmosphere. We have to allow people to be themselves, sing their own songs, and we have to learn to harmonize with other groups of people."
" I was warned...
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,4,"An incredibly pointless, overly sweet tale- with very little thought at all put into it- Trolls is well accompanied to the many other random animated flicks that are soon to be forgotten over time. I can't say this film is a disaster, nor can I say it's boring. For how dreadfully annoying and gimmicky this film is, I was never bored during it, then again, I assume that if I was I would have a problem since the amount of sparkling lights within one scene is almost enough to blind someone. The film is a musical, but very little of it original, if you want to call it that at all. Its songs are mostly covers of much better songs, and some of the covers- namely The Gorillaz 'Clint Eastwood', are absolutely dreadful. Its plot is absolutely ridiculous and incredibly thin, as well as its characters provided. Each character feels like one giant cliche, no matter how many angles they try to put on it, and the storyline seems like a hodgepodge of much better animated films. The animation is decent, although a bit odd at times, and its humor is quite all over the place and often very uneven with the tone it tries to set. There are parts of this film where I am convinced it was just a giant commercial, and plenty of scenes I feel are incredibly filler and useless, then again if they wern't there, this film would maybe be 45mins long. In the end, Trolls is a film I am more than fine with never seeing ever again. It's a mostly forgettable animated wannabe, and besides a few hilariously ridiculous lines that I can't wrap my head around, I doubt i'll remember much of it after tomorrow.
My Rating: 4/10"
" Bright and colorful
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,7,"This is a super solid, fun, colorful kids movie. Nothing more, nothing less."
" An annoyingly awful movie
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,1,Never seen anything quite worse. I hate this piece of garbage they call a movie.
" Colorful movie that's great for the kid in all of us
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,10,"Months ago, when Universal released Trolls World Tour on demand in addition to playing at drive-ins due to the pandemic, it became a game changer. Before you see that movie, see this one first from 2016. This movie was a huge hit for Dreamworks Animation and was one of the last ones to be released by Fox before Comcast took over DWA and handled distribution of their movies starting with the final How to Train Your Dragon movie which was amazing. As for Trolls, it's catchy and there's a lot of fun songs. The animation is bright and the pace is quick."
" Colourful consumerism at it's worst
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,1,"It's a film based (as far as I can see) around the message that consumerism will not cure unhappiness. The thing is, it uses a toy that was sold in all sorts of shops (and still is) as it's inspiration. Helped sell millions of singles of Justin Timberlake's song that was made for the film and lurches from one auto-tuned song to the next in a blinding slap in the face of colour and glitter. I'm sure it's enjoyable for some children but any self-respecting adult should, and probably will hate it."
" Enjoyable musical film for kids and adults alike
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,8,"Thanks to being a parent I have now seen this film much more often than I'd like, but it still manages to be fairly entertaining. Poppy and Branch have a great dynamic, and I have to say that Justin Timberlake did an amazing job with this film's soundtrack. I look forward to being made to watch the sequel 5 times a day after that comes out...."
" A 90 minute Hasbro Commercial
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,7,"I love animation and own a huge collection of Disney, Pixar, and Don Bluth films ( among others). This movie is pure ""dreck"". It is designed to sell toys and only can appeal to very young children. My 2 granddaughters, both under 6, adore it. I could hardly sit through it. It borrows shamelessly from ""Cinderella"" and everyone in the movie (except for the cute little trolls) wants to eat someone to achieve true happiness. All the trolls want to do is play and party. A soundtrack with bits and pieces of many songs from the 60's and 70's. It has one decent song ""Can't Stop the Feeling""."
" Cured my depression
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,10,"So cute, light hearted and fun. Would recommend to anyone who needs a cute feel good movie/ pick me up :)"
" Very upbeat
",2020-06-01 00:00:00,7,"This film is a surprisingly heartfelt adaptation of the trolls toys. The premise is that the ""Bergens"" want to eat the trolls and end up capturing some. The other trolls band together to save them. Along the way we get the highlight of the film, Bridget the Bergen, who has her own little storyline that intersects with the trolls."
" Fantastic Film
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,10,"My 21 mo daughter loves this movie. We stumbled upon it a couple weeks ago and now she asks to watch it daily. She loves the colors, music and especially the dancing. The story line is cute and the music is awesome."
" Just amazing one
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,10,I love this movie and I will watch the next one On September
" Good
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,7,"Good fun with some nostalgic music. Kids definitely like it, adults will also have some nostalgia when hearing music and a good way to deliver a message."
" This movie is kinda Strange
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,1,"Not gonna lie, Trolls don't like singing instead there are a mythical, cave-dwelling being depicted in folklore as either a giant or a dwarf, typically having a very weird looking, to be honest, if you live in Scandinavia"
" A Kind of a Waste of Time
",2020-05-02 00:00:00,3,"The movie has a great plot, a great concept, and a weak storyline.
The movie is good enough for smaller children, but for people above age 13, it's somewhat annoying and or boring.Looking at the trailer, I had high expectations. When the movie started, I was excited. 20 minutes into the movie I lower my expectations, 10 minutes later I am getting bored.
The character Poppy is just annoying, her friends are also annoying. Branch is a sensible character whom no one listens to, he is ultimately proved right. Thus, eventually Branch should be the lead character, and Poppy should be the supporting role not the opposite.
After watching the whole movie, I've realized that I don't like the whole scenario of Trolls and Bergen's. The eating part is fine. I'm talking about the two extremes, one is beautiful, bright, kind, happy-go-lucky and the other is this dark, disgusting, sad, and bad.
There are so many times an unwanted situation or outcome could have been easily avoided, but it just wasn't.
Nowadays, I don't think that in most kids movies, a lot of effort is put into story building. Most kid movies go like this - good guy hates bad guy, bad guy hates good guy, bad guy hurts good guy a little bit, good guy ends bad guy in the most bad and humiliating way possible.
There weren't any good plot twists. Most scenes were predictable. I mean everyone knew that the loud partying was going to have consequences. Everyone saw that coming.
Conclusion: WASTE OF TIME & MONEY
PS: Now that I think of it, it was just a way to empty parents' pockets by tricking them into thinking that this is a great kids movie."
" Trolls
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,7,"Being a raver at heart, it's fun to watch these troll live in the ultimate psychedelic fantasy. With non-stop music, dancing, hugs, and trippy hairdos, these Trolls know how to keep it PLUR!I'm not usually a big fan of musicals, but this movie has a nice variety of songs and keeps them short, fun, and too the point. Never a moment to get bored. Most of the songs are very cliché, generic, pop songs, but they are catchy and upbeat, so it's hard to complain.Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake have great chemistry and put a lot of personality into the characters. I think they nailed it.I feel like the team that made this movie did a great job collaborating between the writing, acting, and animation to create lots of really great moments for characters that a truly hilarious. Unlike most comedies, this one seems to get funnier each time I watch it. I can't get enough of the fun characters and find myself smiling throughout the day thinking of the great moments in this film.Creative musical numbers like ""Sounds of Darkness"" perfectly complement hilarious comedy scenes like the encounter with M. Cloud, and lead me to believe that the guys who directed this movie have a lot of talent.I'm surprised this film doesn't have a higher rating. I really can't think of what is not to like, but I'm guessing it's just one of those things where you either love it or hate it. I can see it becoming somewhat of a cult classic. I really hope it made enough money that we will get to see a sequel!"
" Unsuspected amazing movie
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,8,"I thought this would be just a cash grab with beautiful colors and the most popular songs at the moment but i was happyli wrong. Not only it has amazing diverse songs that usually don't see in these kind of movies,the characters(some at least) are well written and enjoyable."
" cant give it too much hate
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,5,"Its a very standard family film with a lot of music. now im not that big of a pop fan, but it was alright. animation was pretty decent with a lot of originality. it hit the ""colourfull"" aspect very on the nail.5/10: its alright"
" Amazing movie!
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie has been my daughters favorite since it came out! It's Trolls everything in her little world! We love the songs and the story and brightness it's colorful, and it definitely catches the attention of little viewers who at sometimes can be hard to have them sit through a movie!"
" Can't Stop This Feeling
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,10,"Trolls is a perfect Dreamworks Animation family movie of the year. It has heart, joy, laughter, and all the fun. Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake are perfect singing Trolls in the movie. Now this is a perfect musical film since The Road to El Dorado."
" Annoying
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,2,"The most I can say about this movie is it made money off of young children's entertainment and a hit Song track cover. There really is nothing else to say about this film. It's characters, plot, and songs are annoying, and the fact that kids will be singing the latest 2016-17 pop song for 6 months until Despicable Me 3 comes out and we have to sit through a movie about a bald jaundice child, this movie makes my head go from a migraine, to a full on explosion."
" Lovely movie 👌🏾
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,10,"Had to watch this in time for Trolls World Tour and I must say I really did enjoy it. Loved the voices, the music and the overall plot was marvelous. The whole family enjoyed this and they won't stop bothering me to get Trolls World Tour."
" Amazing visual and audio work
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,10,"The musical numbers are perfectly matched with the creative design of the animation which is so unique and impressive. Gotta love a kids movie that doesn't drive you crazy whatsoever, even after the 20th viewing."
" Not funny did't laugh
",2020-03-08 00:00:00,2,Awful comedy terrible music definitely do not recommend.
" A fun adventure!
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,8,"This movie is unique, fun, and imaginative! It makes you want to sing and dance! You'll feel happy just watching the Trolls do their thing!"
" A very near perfect film.
",2020-02-27 00:00:00,9,"Although Animated, and targeted to a younger audience, the quality of script writing, character development and morals being taught, are of the highest quality.
Timeless and an instant classic for all ages!"
" Fun music, quirky, great characters with funny lines
",2020-02-08 00:00:00,10,"I love the music, and so does my daughter. She's currently obsessed with both the movie and the soundtrack. There are some hilarious one liners, and I also really love the characters of Brigit and King Gristle and their storyline. There are so many good things about this...it's definitely worth a watch!"
" Horrible
",2019-11-27 00:00:00,1,"I respect people's opinions on this film but I hate it, the characters are not interesting and neither is the plot. For a movie with bright coulors it's actually dark a plot point in the movie is creatures eating trolls and a chef getting fired for one little mistake, also Branch is grumpy because he blames himself for his grandma
getting eaten. It turns out that things are only bright and colorful is because they are happy and when they are not they turn grey also the music is boring and didn't use it in a creative way. They also have a character being treated like a slave for no reason who also has a useless plotline about her trying to date the king who looks like and acts like a child. But I have to give the cast credit for trying. The twist villain is stupid and has no purpose except to get eaten at the end by a hill. Also what the hell is that pink thing with the green hat it doesn't look like a troll. And why does Mr.Dinkles turn gray too I don't think he's a troll either. This has got to be the worst movie ever the Emoji Movie is better. This movie makes Shark Tale look like a masterpiece.I hate this movie and I would give it a one out of one hundred"
" Best kids movie
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,10,Love the songs and it's a really funny movie. My kids love this movie. A movie the whole family can enjoy
" Very cute movie
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,8,"I was skippy when I first watched this movie. I thought it was going to be cheesy. I was wrong. This is probably the most colorful and cutest movie I have ever seen. The artwork is nice, so nice that I even saw a behind the scenes of it.
Artwork is excellent. The animation is great. The characters are cute and funny. The story is actually pretty good with a great twist. Poppy, the main character, is so cheerful that she makes me cheerfully when I watch this movie. It was so sad to see her sad, but I do have a question, why are all happy characters pink? (Ex: Unikitty) The story is well paced and easy to follow. If you have children, this movie is almost perfect to watch with the entire family."
" Trolls
",2019-08-02 00:00:00,6,I can definitely tell that the makers of Shrek were behind this.
" dont see it
",2019-07-06 00:00:00,3,The movie was bland boring and annoying. SEE another movie
" Not surprised at all.
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,4,"Trolls may not be DreamWorks Animation's best movie, but it's also not the worst that they've made, since you can't always know what to expect from them all of the time and there a moments that the studio releases amazing and unfortunately most of the time many bad and mediocre movies, so that's why i have a very complicated relationship with the studio, because they are part of my childhood and i want them to succeed like Walt Disney and Pixar and make art, but i don't see this nowadays. The movie fails so much in the most important aspects like story, characters, screenplay and (of course) huge percent of the music, since it's counted as a musical, but that doesn't mean that i didn't find enjoyment watching it. At least i can say that it's way better than most animated movies that are released by Illumination."
" Trolls
",2019-06-01 00:00:00,9,"Justin Timberlake is a well known singer/songwriter, with his all time hit song being, ""Can't Stop the Feeling."" His recent appearance in the movie ""Trolls"" capitalized on that. The movie runs song after song, featuring the mentioned song as the ending notes of joy. I'm fifteen. I think that this wasn't a waste of time and money. I have little brothers. They would watch this movie 10 times if they could. Making my feelings towards the movie above par.As a fan of music, I appreciated the songs that were both featured and played. Justin did a great job working with other artists such as Ariana Grande to come up with the movie's melodic soundtrack. Anna Kendrick definitely sings her handful of the music, with the majority of them being upbeat, live life to the fullest sort of songs. This is great if you enjoy a catchy song that gets stuck in your head throughout the day. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a song played on loop every now and then.This movie was a very predictable movie, with having nearly everything being wrapped in a nice, glitter-filled bow. When the inciting event came around, I could think for one minute and depict how the movie would end. But, I guess it was nice to listen to all the songs whilst my prediction unfolded.I think that if you are a child who is looking for a fairly humorous, childish movie, then ""Trolls"" is your film. A mom who has children should consider this movie for a fun weekend with the kids. Who knows? Maybe she will have a nice song stuck in her head too. I would suggest this movie for all who would like some laughs and a catchy tune."
" Great film
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,10,It is my 2 year olds favourite. It is very funny and has great songs he loves dancing along too. It is full of bright colours and strange creatures :)
" This deserves a higher rating!
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,10,"I'm surprised to see a 6.5 overall score. This is one of the best kid movies in recent years. It's hilarious, cute, entertaining and watchable over and over again! I enjoy it every time. I'm not sure what these ppl are basing their low scores on, but let's rate it for what it is. A funny interesting entertaining kids movie with a great message! I think the voice actors do an amazing job as well, truly. Especially Justin Timberlake which is very surprising, but also Ana Kendrick, it makes this movie! Love it and will watch it years to come with my LO's."
" Trolls Review
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,10,"The trolls live in constant fear of being eaten by Bergens, a race of much larger beasts who want to gobble them up to absorb their cheerful essence. When a number of trolls are kidnapped during a party, their leader, Princess Poppy (Anna Kendrick), sets out to rescue them.
Fuzzy-headed residents of many a '90s school desk, Thomas Dam's ugly little Good Luck Trolls don't have much backstory to bring to the screen. The LEGO Movie showed that lack of in-built narrative can be an opportunity to let your imagination run wild, but this aims lower.
A creative team that has worked on various Shreks and Kung Fu Pandas has put together a plot that is just about good enough to get it from beginning to end without confusion, but doesn't hold anything in the way of real surprises. The Trolls are a happy, clappy, huggy band who live in a tree in the middle of a town occupied by much bigger, even uglier monsters who believe the only way to experience happiness is to eat a Troll. Talk about your bad neighbourhoods. The bare bones of this story give every scope for taking absurd flights of fancy with the comedy, and the few times it decides to do that it bursts into life. Too often, though, it's happy to just be cute. Cute is nice enough, but clever and funny are better.
The voice cast lifts it. Anna Kendrick, as the young leader of the Trolls, knows how to do adorable without being overly saccharine, and Justin Timberlake plays it pleasingly low-key as the most cynical of the Trolls. Much of the rest of the famous voice cast - James Corden, Gwen Stefani, Russell Brand - are there to add name recognition, rather than any real character. To dislike something this permanently upbeat would be hard. It's too... pleasant to really annoy. It's funny enough to induce smiles if not laughs, and sweet and likeable, if nothing more."
" Best movie ever!
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,10,"We absolutely love this movie! My daughter is 3 years old, i'm 43 and it's our favourite!!!! So colourful, great music, very fun and cute!Watched it over 20 times since Xmas. Can't wait to see the sequel!"
" Horrible all around
",2019-01-02 00:00:00,1,"This is a movie with crude humor and horror scenes fit for a teenager, but with a plot so ridiculous it can only be meant for children. The humor that isn't crude simply isn't funny, and the songs typically have little to do with the plot. This movie is not enjoyable by any definition, and I really do not recommend that you allow your kids to watch it."
" This movie is trolling parents
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,3,"I swear that Trolls is trolling parents. Because while this movie is full of bright colors and peppy music, which kids love, the story is nothing more than a series of worn-out clichés that are merely a vehicle to get from one lackluster karaoke number to the next. The animation was decent, but other than that, Trolls is just annoying. Please don't let there be a sequel! *checks the internet* DANGIT!"
" think it was good but my kids didn't like it
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,7,"My kids said it was so girly because of all the glitterregards
joseph jackson"
" amusing and delightful
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,10,A phenomenal children's movie that can entirely apply to the lives of modern adults. A superb examination of depression and how environmental factors can impact someone's views on their life! Truly beautiful with excellent motivational techniques for all ages.
" Singing trolls.
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,7,"The animation is good and has some likeable characters. But there are flaus like some of the songs are annoying and the Bergans are stupid, because their beleif is stupid."
" This movie is phat
",2018-11-27 00:00:00,10,This movie is fun. Songs are great. Jokes are funny. Characters are cool. Anna Kendricks and Justin Timberlake are great together. The kids love it! Boys and girls.
" Hands down the worst
",2018-11-09 00:00:00,1,"Hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. Can't think of a single halfway decent scene. It ruined the word ""troll"" and was a feature length music video for I got this feeling."
" Feelgood
",2018-10-20 00:00:00,10,"Awesome feelgood family film
Give it a go, watch to the end - you won't be disappointed! Let go for a while...
Justin's last song made me emotional"
" Saccharine and sactimonious
",2018-09-25 00:00:00,3,"Just a very loud and annoying movie. Kids will probably enjoy it and that's fine, but there are so many other better family films out there--Kubo, Iron Giant, Coco, ParaNorman, Coraline, Zootopia, Captain Underpants, How to Train Your Dragons, etc.. Tries way too hard to be this uber-happy movie and for some that's gonna be great, but I found it to be incredibly annoying and kinda arrogant. It's also absurdly predictable. Guessed that one character would be a Judas the second they popped up and was right. Not bragging or anything--it's Trolls--the film just doesn't have anything going on under the hood.The message is pretty awful. Be happy all of the time and if you're not, then something is wrong with you. It's like one of those 1950 propaganda films except with far too much energy. Sure, it's colorful and not badly animated (it's Dreamworks, duh), but it's not all that special either. Not very funny, for me at least. I do have a pretty weird sense of humor but this movie had some real groaners.It's a shame when Dreamworks phones it in. Dreamworks has, in the past, turned in some wonderful movies that are a cut above flicks like Gnomeo & Juliet. They made KUNG FU PANDA STARRING JACK BLACK of all things into something worth watching regardless of age. But between films like this and the equally pitiable Home, they may have lost their way with the recent acquisition. Or this may have just been their b-team while everyone with genuine ideas and talent works on films like Captain Underpants and Kung Fu Panda."
" Entertaining enough kids' feature
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,7,"My fiance made me watch this one and to my surprise it was not as bad as I thought it was going to be. It provided a bit of entertainment and featured some funny moments within its running time. We would later watch The Emoji Movie and that would be as bad as I thought it was going to be and she did not care for that one either. This one though managed to create funny and entertaining characters considering this thing was likely made to just to create more toys for the kids to go out and buy as the trolls here looked like more detailed trolls than the ones released sometime in the late 80's early 90's. The story has these creatures called Bergens basically eating the trolls because it is the only way they can be happy as trolls are singing and happy creatures in this film. The leader of the trolls though devises an escape and they end up forming their own town outside the realm of the Bergens. The cook of the Bergens gets the blame and is expelled from the city and life goes on peacefully for the trolls, that is, until the trolls throw a really big celebration that catches the eyes of a certain cook who is then able to capture some trolls and take them into the home of the Bergens to get back into the good graces of the new king. It is up to the super positive Poppy and the really negative Branch to infiltrate the town of the Bergens and rescue their captured friends. It had some really good music in this one and I liked the character of Poppy and the one Bergen who helped Poppy out, Bridget. I found it humorous when they started doing one of those music montages when they were giving Bridget a makeover and it gets cut short because Branch is not singing.So I enjoyed this film a bit, the only reason I did not rank it higher, I am not the biggest fan of computer generated films. I prefer live action films and my favorite animation type is anime. Not to say I don't like them all, just not my favorite media, though I am definitely in the minority because a lot of these films do so incredibly well including some that just seem so mediocre. This one is enjoyable enough, but I think it was because of Poppy's incredibly positive attitude even as she is being wrapped up by a spider and passing out that won me over."
" This needs waaaay higher ratings
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,10,"Trolls is hilarious, great for kids...but there is a TON of humor that I know was meant to go above their heads. And I dug it. The rave scenes- so damn funny. The subtle festival vibe the trolls have is awesome. Great cast, voices were chosen perfectly. Soundtrack - excellent! Will pull you in and having you singing everything later. I don't even have kids, but I watched this on a flight -- and then watched it two more times at home lol."
" Marvelous
",2018-09-08 00:00:00,8,"Honestly, I had a wonderful moment when i was watching this movie.Those words in the movie especially the lines (happiness is inside of us someone has to help to find it) splendid words absolutely. Moreover the total credits departs to the director the way he narrated the whole plot just spectacular. one and half hour it disappears as like seconds. Now i am so happy with a open mind and my views how i feel is extremely something positive way. Let every child enact to proceed from their initial carrier picturing kind of movies like these. May be would assist them for a better tolerance,kindness and generous beyond on them to civilise themselves in the amid enormous of peoples"
" Goofy, ridiculous and hilarious
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,7,"This movie is extremely random. It is goofy and ridiculous which actually makes it hilarious at times.Although they may break out into song more than expected, it makes the movie more humorous.The story is somewhat predictable but it is still enjoyable to watch. The film also includes a positive message in the midst of all the ridiculousness.This is a movie that isn't excellent but it definitely will make you laugh."
" A Joy
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,10,"This film makes me want to kiss Justin Timberlake. The kids love it, I love it.I can even overlook James Corden, whose unbearable conceit shines through even in his 3 lines as a character in this movie. I can't stand him in anything, he is a pet hate - but even he can't ruin this one for me.Good fun, classic storytelling - the reviewers who don't get it probably don't have kids is my guess.If you are the type of person who will critique ""realism"" in a kids film called Trolls then yeh, should probably skip this one."
" What is going on?
",2018-07-24 00:00:00,2,"This is the worst movie i ever seen. The story is to simple and the whole idea is stupid. I wached it on cinema becuse i wanted some laugh-time, after the first 3 seconds i just wanted to leave the cinema. So booring and the songs just make it whorse, ive tried to say it for a long time that when characthers sings in to the camera they ruin the movie. Nobody would do that in real life!"
" Cute but the singing is so disappointing
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,7,I guess you should expect sound production of every sort but i also expect it to be seamless and very high quality. Well it's not. Or maybe JT is really that bad. The movie is all in all very enjoyable
" A cute and creative movie that all ages will enjoy!
",2018-07-07 00:00:00,9,"At first, I came in thinking the movie was just going to be a mediocre kids movie. Afterward, I think its one of my favorites!"
" Kids will love this but grown up??
",2018-06-08 00:00:00,1,"The most happy person go bad when their happiness go away. When Poppy lost her friends she took Branch's place , ruin his place only because she is unhappy that time. What Branch believe what Branch build for his happiness Poppy destroy within a second when Branch reject her proposal to rescue their friend. You think you are a happy person don't think you are good too. Chilling out side all time, bring danger on yourself and then spoil other happiness because you are not happy, their thinking doesn't match with them."
" Hooo boy
",2018-06-01 00:00:00,3,"Felt more like an illumination film than a DreamWorks film honestly... As an adult it had lots of cringe... Wanted to look away but I couldn't. Anywho, it's probably good for kids but heh I'm in my 20's what do I know bout a child audience"
" Good kids' film
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,7,"When the joyful Trolls are threatened with destruction (the monstrous Bergens eat them in order to gain momentary happiness), it is up to the relentlessly cheerful Princess Poppy and the morose Branch to come to the rescue.I'm sure you remember those ugly little toys with the massive sticky-up hair from your childhood: well, they take centre stage in this romp through a confrontation with their mythic ages-old foes, the Bergens. The source of the conflict is the simplest of things - happiness - and this plays a major part in the motivations of all the principal characters.Given that Trolls are - well, Trolls, there is inevitably a similarity of appearance among them, but the character designers have done a good job in making each character well differentiated so that they are easily recognisable. Similarly, the Bergens have strong individual hideousnesses (is ""hideousnesses"" even a word?). And the voice cast, headed by Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake, does sterling work, with the singing being as good as the acting.Given the trend for movies to look drab, dark, dull and desaturated, it was a pleasure to see a film which positively pulsates with prismatic polychromaticism. Some of the musical routines are the modern equivalent of the spectacular Busby Berkeley mass dance routines from Hollywood musicals of the 1940s, only bursting with colour. The story is primarily functional, but it carries a moderate amount of emotional payoff as the main characters all have decent character arcs. The resolution might be accused of being glib if this was not primarily a kids' film. Even so, there is a lot here for adults to enjoy.And I've always enjoyed Cyndi Lauper's True Colours (despite its overuse in UK TV advertising): the routine in which it is used here is exquisite and moving. It might have been written expressly for this movie."
" Definitely a favorite in our home!
",2018-05-14 00:00:00,10,I have a few small children that live with me and they're absolutely obsessed with this movie! We watch it at least 5-6 times a day and it never really gets old for us. We love it and it's so cute!
" A brilliant story for the kids.
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,10,"I disagree will the low score Trolls has on IMDB!Trolls is a truly fun movie, with heaps of energy, colour and soul. The musical adaptations are superb."
" Not Enough Effort
",2018-03-24 00:00:00,5,"Such a disappointing lackluster film that could have been so much more if the effort was put in. The animation is unoriginal and bland. The design of the trolls were colorful and bright but the rest of the environment and design of the antagonists were under saturated. The over use of popularized music was absolutely obnoxious. The only exception was the ""True Colors"" sequence which actually took the song and developed strong emotion. The interaction and chemistry between characters was undeveloped especially with our two leads. You only lightly scratch at the surface level of their romantic/platonic friendship when other films, such as Beauty and the Beast and Zootopia, play out this relationship so much better."
" Cute movie
",2018-03-23 00:00:00,10,"I don't know why there are so many negative reviews, this movie was fun for the whole family. Loved the story line and the music...your kids will love it"
" Super Cute
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,7,Not as lame as I thought it was gonna be. Really enjoyed it. And Bridget? I wish I could pull her out of the screen and hug her.
" Trolls doesn't measure up to Dreamworks standards..
",2017-12-21 00:00:00,1,"Based on the popular toys, Trolls centers on two tiny trolls called Poppy and Branch, who go on a quest to rescue their friends from being eaten at the annual Trollstice, held by the miserable Bergens.When I first saw the teaser trailer for Trolls, I knew it would be something quite unbearable, and BOY was I right! The whole movie is offensively patronizing, and lazy; Instead of being original, or creative, it pads out 80% of it's narrative with characters randomly performing recognizable pop songs. With little to no concern about whether these jukebox musical numbers, help the story to move forward, or add something to the film. It's the oldest trick in the book; Emotionally manipulate the audience by referencing happy pop songs that sound comfortably familiar. It's much easier than coming up with your own material to satisfy them, or enrich their minds.This isn't my only gripe with the movie though; It's lead characters are SO one-dimensional and bland, that we know how their character arcs will play out as soon as we see them on screen! Not to mention, the film also forces these two into a romantic connection, just because it's the usual Hollywood tradition. Plus, it's because the studio thinks that audiences are suckers for anything romantic. This just comes across as formulaic and contrived, because they share SO little chemistry; They spend most of the movie arguing.The cherry on top of Trolls problem's has to be it's desperate and cringe-inducing attempts at being cool, hip and relevant to today's generation. From having characters rap out of nowhere, to having a troll baby scream ""YOLO!"" at a crazy rave party. It's so embarrassing, and it's going to date this movie TERRIBLY. Trolls is a desperate, awkward and uninspired movie, with nothing creative, or imaginative to offer. To say that I didn't like it, would be an understatement."
" Does not deserve a G rating.
",2017-12-20 00:00:00,1,"First off, if you are a Christian, do not let your kids see this movie. The main idea of this movie is essentially that the way to get rid of an evil spirit is just to ""be happy"" enough, which is obviously not what the Bible teaches.Second, even if your family isn't religious, your kids have no business watching this movie. Either they will be creeped out by it, in which case they are too young (like I said, the ""G"" rating is outrageous), or they will not be creeped out by it, in which case they are too old or too mature to be wasting their time on this mindless drivel.Not only this movie, but the entire genre of ""overly-happy sappy generic messages, pretty colours"" is an insult to any one who has ever experienced the real world. Similar to shows and movies like My little Pony Friendship is Magic, Sofia the First, Puppy in My pocket, or Care Bears, they are overly-sweet, vapid, pandering, the characters aren't put in any danger, or the characters themselves have no personality. While I was relieved that the movie WASN'T overly-sappy, or this decade's version of ""A Troll in Central Park"", it instead tries to be hip, cool and relevant, all while failing. Not to mention that the characters aren't put in any danger. Don't let your kids watch Trolls, or the upcoming TV show. Buying them the toys is fine, but keep them away from the upcoming animated series. Trolls has no educational or moral value. The whole theme of the entire Troll Dolls franchise is that all your problems will just go away if only you and your friends just ""Be Happy"" enough. American Greetings, if you're reading this, than all I have to say to you is try telling that to the the little kid who just lost a friend to cancer, or the kid who's dog just got put to sleep.There are some who would defend this movie as being just harmless fun even if they do acknowledge that it doesn't have a very strong moral foundation. To that I say, first of all, anyone over age 4 will be bored to tears over this intelligence-insulting movie. It is not fun, and as for me, I have no fond nostalgic memories of the Troll dolls themselves. Second, little kids need to be learning how to be effectively dealing with the problems life throws their way, and learning that ""Happiness"" isn't always enough. They also need to learn the harsh realities of life, like the fact that holding hands and standing in a circle with your friends shouting the ""Happiness is inside you"" message over and over again will not bring your dead grandmother back."
" I HATE this movie!
",2017-12-13 00:00:00,1,"There are very few times in life, that I can say that a film has felt like it has ROBBED me of something; like I felt like less of a human being when I walked out of the cinema. This is one of those rare cases. So, Trolls is the newest film from Dreamworks Animation, and boy howdy are they heading backwards with this one! It's based off the old troll dolls that have been around since the 1960's. In this movie, there's this race of trolls, who are living in a forest, they've got lovely lives, they dance, they laugh, they hug a lot. But then one day, this big bad thing called a Bergen comes, and takes some of the trolls away to be eaten. And now it's up to the princess Poppy, played by Anna Kendrick, and this grumpy troll named Branch, voiced by Justin Timberlake to try and get their friends to freedom... and yeah! From that synopsis ALONE, you know exactly what's going to happen in this thing! Okay, now listing one positive: The animation in this movie, isn't half bad; it's very bright, it's very colourful, it's very pretty to look at, so I'll say good job on the animation team for that! But NO. I'm not being nice to this one, let's just get into this MESS. Watching this movie has got to be one of the most insufferable cinema experiences, I've had in a while! This film just feels like an excuse to have a string of pop songs stacked together with a vague, insanely predictable plot, woven in between them. If you have seen a kid's film, you have seen this plot done, and done better, a hundred thousand times, before! It's all about finding happiness, and being happy, and I HATE films that have messages like that. Throughout this whole movie, I kept thinking back to films like Inside Out where the lesson was, the necessity for unhappiness. It's okay for kids to learn that being unhappy, isn't always a bad thing! Being sad, or angry, is important for a person to experience in life, especially nowadays! In movies like Trolls, the lesson is quite simply ""Be happy, all the time always, and everything will just sort itself out."" That is an AWFUL message, and it annoys me that we're STILL getting movies that teach it to kids! The characters in this movie were beyond, obnoxious; just the way they would talk with these INSANELY dated phrases: ""Solid burn, Branch"". Solid burn, returned"". It gets terrible! Now let's talk about the songs. Yeah, they're bad. It's just the fact that they were bad, it's the fact that they take up the MAJORITY of the movie! Every 5 minutes, they will just cut to another pop song, and then another one, and then another, and then another, and then another. It was just this endless of infuriating pop songs, that just never seems to end! Half of the songs didn't even make any sense, I mean there's a moment when the characters start singing ""Clint Eastwood"" by the Gorillaz, and I was just left going, WHY? As a person who is really not a big fan of musicals, in fact I hate most of them, this was my impression of what PAIN would be like! Not to mention the fact that the movie is INCREDIBLY annoying, it's also got some of the moronic, and potentially harmful messages, a kid's film could HAVE in this day and age! We are living in a time, where emotional problems in children are becoming more and more apparent, so just telling them to just put on a smile and be happy, and then ALL their trouble will go away, is not only stupid, it's DANGEROUS. So, to sum up, this movie was just disturbing. The characters were insanely annoying, the plot is recycled from 100 other kid's films, the songs make me want to take a cheese grater to my ears, and the message is some of the most BACKWARDS a kid's film can BE."
" I know this is just an unpopular opinion, but....
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,1,"I did not like this movie, for several reasons:1. The characters were flat, one-dimensional, and oddly unlikable. I didn't like Poppy, because she was just a huge modern Disney Princess cliché, and Branch was incredibly rude and obnoxious.2. The message was basically ""be happy, all the time always, and everything will just sort itself out"". That is not only a terrible, and dangerous message to 5 year old's, it's also painting the world in a black and white format, which is not how the world works. Kids need to learn knowledge and awareness to survive in the real world. And finally..3. Why would Dreamworks make this movie? I get it was probably just trying to be a simple, kids movie cash-grab, but that's not an excuse for sucking. Remember, Dreamworks can make amazing movies from time to time, like The Prince Of Egypt, or Spirit, that can even battle 1900's Disney movies. While this movie isn't the worst by Dreamworks standards, it's still a bland, cookie-cutter movie, made just to sell merchandise."
" Good for kids but for people older... that's another story
",2017-11-20 00:00:00,2,"This is the biggest letdown that Dreamworks ever made! They try to be Disney but TOO MUCH SINGING!! Disney movies are better because they limit their singing. Anyways they sing so much that I don't know what's the story, hell if there is a story. It tried to be hip for kids and ends up being all hipster and stuff. I rather watch that cheesy horror movie with the same name then this crap. DON'T WATCH IT!!!"
" I don't quite understand the message of this movie
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,4,"As far as contemporary kid's films go, this film is what you should expect; it's relevant to young children with it's jokes, references and song choice and the visuals are somewhat pleasing. A young child will love this movie for sure but for an adult it can be a bit of a pain to sit through due the aforementioned features. Now, the reason I watched this film is because my younger sister turned it on at a relatives house whom we were visiting- I decided I may as well watch it too. Towards the beginning, I had no interest in the film of course, until a bit later on, I try to search for the message of the film. The ogres or whatever- the deplorable looking guys that eat the trolls- spontaneously start singing ""Clint Eastwood"" by Gorillaz. This is what really confused me because this is a song about smoking weed to get happy, and those creatures likewise,eat the trolls to be happy. So my guess is that the song choice was intentional, a belief backed up later by the film when the main protagonist says some tripe about 'not consuming things to be happy'. Is this film a 90 minute advert on not doing drugs? I guess my mind looks too far into stupid superficial things when I'm bored. If you're looking for a good family movie, just watch Kubo."
" The Happiest, Loudest, Craziest Movie in awhile
",2017-11-16 00:00:00,9,"This movie is just made of joy, to be honest. Our main characters are surprisingly multidimensional in more than just how they're animated, Poppy and Branch are full fleshed out characters, and the story is absolutely wonderful. It's a very Smurf-y tale (the TV series, not the movies), but it puts a nice spin on it with great animation, music, and characters. The dialogue is great for all ages in my opinion, and it never leaves wit behind even with its mildly slapstick-like sequences. It helps that the humor is quite a few grades above fart and poop jokes. The animation is smooth, and the textures are amazing--it looks almost like stop animation in most places with the attention to detail to make everything and everyone look kind of fuzzy. All in all, the would receive a 10/10 if the ending hadn't been quite as abrupt as I felt it was. The story cruised by smoothly at a regular pace up until the last few sequences, when I felt it was a little rushed. But it's one of my favorite movies, and it brings a smile to my face every time I watch it or hear one of the songs."
" Fun, comical family movie. The bad reviews are idiotic.
",2017-10-30 00:00:00,10,"Great movie about choosing your attitude despite your circumstances, the importance of community, and the weight of leadership. A welcome message amidst a culture of isolation, device addiction, and hyper group-think. I might be a tad bias since the two main characters basically have the same dynamic as my wife and I. Cloud guy is awesome."
" Can't Scrapbook Your Way Out of This
",2017-10-30 00:00:00,4,"Trolls was not that great. Definitely not one of Dreamworks' better films. The troll characters were adorable, but a bit over the top. There wasn't any attempt of characterization with anyone except the two main trolls. The rest were just filler and background noise. Making their personalities super happy and hyper was fitting for the quirky dolls I grew up with in the 1990s, but the dialogue and story were so badly developed that the whole movie lacked the entertaining aspects it should have had. Not even the villains were interesting. I couldn't even tell you their names. The animation was done really well (no surprise as Dreamworks is great). Making the environments look like arts and crafts, with felt textures, glitter and sewing, was a neat way to build the world, even if it looked cartoonish at times. The scrapbooking was super cute. I loved that Poppy made elaborate cards for all occasions (or just because). It resulted in some funny situations. It did feel like Dreamworks tried to make up for the bad story by making the imagery really busy as a distraction, and that didn't help the situation.I was expecting original music, and was a bit disappointed to find out that the songs were mainly mash-ups of popular hits. With the exception of a few, not even very good hits. Justin Timberlake's voice was wasted in this. He only got one song, but it was one of the better ones in the movie.Overall, I probably wouldn't watch this movie again."
" This movie is a masterpiece
",2017-10-28 00:00:00,10,"this is the best movie ever and I am really surprised how this movie rating is so low, it should be given an eight out of ten in my opinion.It should also win an Oscar.It's that kind of impressive animation which makes u happy, delightful and confident on a gloomy day.This movie gives you hope, positivity to never give up. anyone's mood will be cheerful after watching this wonderful animated movie. please do watch, highly recommended."
" Best movie ever made!
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,10,Trolls is like one big huge party all the time. Princess Poppy is such an amazing troll that I aspire to be like. There was not one second that I was not enjoying. I watch the movie at least twice a week. Branch is such a crucial part and how his character develops through out the movie is admirable at the least. Trolls is truly a cinematic piece of excellence! :)
" Suggestion to producer
",2017-10-17 00:00:00,10,"I hope the producer of this movie reads this, I think you should make a Trolls 2 and it should have Poppy and Branch falling in love and getting married and tell a story about Poppy getting kiddnapped by the same spider creatures that she fell in the web of in the first one and then Branch rescues her and then poppy gets pregnant and has troll babies with Branch but make it like Trolls 3 for that part. :)"
" Exactly As Expected
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)These tiny little Trolls are full of gleeful jubilee, smiles and hugs who live carefree lives except for one gigantic fear; the Bergens. The Bergens believe the only way to feel happy is by eating Trolls. The Trolls have recently retreated to a land far from the Bergans. Now the Bergans are sad as a society. One Bergan catches wind of the Trolls location and now their village is in jeopardy. In additional to that storyline, there is one Troll named Branch who refuses to sing, dance or give hugs, which Princess Poppy tries to remedy. Will the Trolls escape the Bergans? Will Branch ever find happiness? There are a few other story lines but overall the story at times of filled with swirling and bursting colors, chases, some decent humor, some moral lessons as well as several singing numbers all of which little kids will enjoy. Young kids may be unnerved by Trolls in peril. Not as deep a story as Toy Story or Inside Out but still a fun movies to enjoy with kids."
" Do you have a shred of inner child? Or not?
",2017-10-04 00:00:00,7,"I am a 70 year old male who spent most of the last two months visiting family including my grandsons-in-law, ages 1 and 3. During the last week, Trolls was on endless rewind from morning until they went to bed. I paid little attention to it until I happened to hear/watch ""True Colors"". Later that day I sat down with the boys and watched it with them.So here I am reading all the IMDb comments on the value or lack there-of in this movie. The low-star crowd, have much to say, pages of words, about its lack of complexity, value, maturity, blah blah blah. I got here by way of looking up Cindi Lauper's song, which happens at the crux of the film, a song that is all about, ""Do you know who you are?"" and ""Do you know that I care?""So all you Burg dwellers, who are you? What do you care about? When was the last time you actually looked at a deep blue sky and multi-shaded clouds or the moon and stars? When was the last time you really listened to someone you care about? Or do you get all your happiness from your fancy car or McMansion? I know, I will rewrite Trolls to be more ""realistic"". That ought to cheer everyone up!Branch arrives a few seconds too late to save Poppy but decides to see if any of the captives are still alive. He arrives a few seconds too late to save them too but stumbles across the king's cape-bauble and frees Creek. The two of them head back and gives the Trolls the sad news. All turn gray and wait to die. But between Branch and Creek (who ""cOhmmmms"" them back to some semblance of self preservation) they all leave the area. Generations pass and the Bergens discover dentistry, skin care and barber shops and are not quite so disgusting looking. But inside they are as clueless and ugly as ever. The old myth about eating trolls fades into obscurity and they never figure out how to be happy on their own. They spread their dirty little town into cities of filth and coal dust to drive their trains and steam cars. They build roads and highways and spread their ""civilization"" to all ends of the planet.In the meantime, the Trolls, still gray, find that if they are quick and clever, they can make a decent living by stealing food and pretty baubles from the Bergens. Before he died of old age, Creek founded a religion, which was just as cynical and self-serving as he secretly was and his priests live off donations from the other Trolls.Just about the time that every square inch of the Bergen planet is covered in asphalt and every inch of sky is obscured by gray clouds of smog and coal dust; every plant dies from lack of sun and water, the seas turn to pink/gray muck from a super bloom of algae and the temperature climbs to 300 degrees which results in everyone and everything dying a horrible death.The EndIt's a kid movie! Get over it! Is it great? Well, it's not Casablanca or The Big Chill or Citizen Kane (Thank Goodness). But yeah, I liked it. And I think that anyone who has a shred of inner child left will like it too. Grownups! Phegh!* * * * * * IMDb. I realize that the following may get me kicked off but...Since my post, I have had a chance to watch my own TV and discover what's going on in the real world. My little attempt at satire is a little to close to comfort. Why am I surprised to find that the Bergens really are in charge and nobody seems to be able or willing to do anything about it? I stand by my original statement.Groan-ups! Phegh! Phegh! Double Phegh!"
" Cuuute!
",2017-09-12 00:00:00,7,"This animation from DreamWorks really got me into it! Although I'm not a huge fan of this genre, there is something about this movie I do appreciate: the scenes full of joy and happiness which create a delightful atmosphere, the little trolls who make everyone smile and laugh and, of course, the fact that it has some music into it, which makes it a great musical, also. It's a kid's movie, I admit, but hey, there's plenty of room for others like me and you, who are a bit ""older"" to enjoy it and have fun watching it. So, what are you waiting for? Go see it!"
" Hollywood must believe children have lost their ears and brains
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,3,"I just don't know what to think anymore. The only way this movie would be good is if you were on a lot of drugs because then all the colors might look mystifying. Otherwise it was horrid. The voice acting was laughable. I don't get how someone would hire Justin Timberlake again after the Shrek sequel he was in. Apparently, displaying that you're awful at voice acting does not keep you from getting voice acting roles. Yet, he is cringe-inducing again. As he has before, his lines sound like they're being read, not said. The script panders way too obviously. It's pretty much only written to get a LGBT endorsement so that nobody can say it's a bad film or else they will be tarred and feathered in public. Due to this, it loses all artistic credibility instantly and becomes another failed PC bandwagon movie."
" An animation only for kids
",2017-08-29 00:00:00,6,"After escaping the infamous Trollstice, a tradition among Bergens which meant eating a troll in order to be happy, the cutesy and happy trolls are once again discovered by their nemesis. As some of them were captured, princess Poppy sets out to rescue them, accompanied by a sad and grumpy Branch which had a troubled childhood.This beautifully animated film depicts the musical adventures of two trolls who attempt to rescue their kind from extinction, while discovering the world and each other's difficult character. It's a very simplistic movie, which seems to be intended only for kids, or at least under 12, because the main characters behave just like them, or in some cases, even like spoiled brats. They are full of colors, dance and joy, leaving the plot and the action way behind. It's extremely predictable and boring, the only thing which saves it from the misery being the animation which is flawless and its music, which seems to be the cure for everything.It is really sad when you see such a film which can be much better that what was achieved here, fall into obscurity because the producers didn't know that even an animation requires a decent plot in order to be good. Even more surprising is the fact that it comes from people who directed Shrek, which simply cannot be compared to this one. It's a below average animation which unfortunately can only be enjoyed by kids."
" Really good fun for kids and adults
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,8,"As with some other kids movies especially Frozen, I thought this was going to be a hour and a half of pain and suffering. To my surprise after watching it with my 2 and 4 year old, I was pleasantly surprised at what fun it is. OK not an original story but the pace of the film, bright and good animation with catchy songs puts a smile on your face. For those who are saying they don't get it, lack of plot and seen if all before, I would say; cheer up, life is too short to be a bloody misery. Good clean fun!Ps - might of given it an 8"
" Dreamworks, you still got it! :D
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,10,"This film was awesome! I've seen this multiple times after buying it on DVD! This films still remains awesome after watching it over and over again!The music is this movie was really catchy and excellent and the characters were great and the acting and story line was again.... great! This movie is up there with my favorite movie Sing. However, Sing still takes the lead but this doesn't mean that this movie is not great!Overall, this movie was amazing and had great music and.... everything about this was great!10/10"

",2017-07-29 00:00:00,10,"Maybe it was time for this GROWNUP to have a good cry about something important; like love. I have watched this movie three times with my grandson; maybe not ALL of it but most. The music is on point and the message is awesome. I recommend for anyone who wants to laugh, cry and hope."
" Fantastic movie with a wonderful message!!!
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,10,"This is by far one of the best animated movies I've ever watched. It is creative, funny, colorful, and above all it has an important message..... happiness lies within! We don't need things (trolls) to make us happy, simple things like dancing, singing, and hugs can make us happy. It's a very moving movie if you think about the real meaning behind the movie. The music is fantastic, me, and my 1 and 3 year old daughters dance throughout the movie in our living room. This movie makes us happy! Thank you Dreamworks Animation!!!!!!!!!"
" Trolls is a pretty adorable movie, but it has little else going for it.
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,4,"There's been a weird trend recently of companies making uninspired movies about nostalgic toys: we had Battleship a few years back, and the Transformers series has been a huge hit, so now we've got Trolls. Why is there a movie about brightly colored toys from the '60s? Sure this isn't as bad as The Smurfs, but it's nothing special.Trolls is a simple adventure movie starring the cheery Princess Peppy (Anna Kendrick) and downer Branch (Justin Timberlake). When a group of trolls is captured to be eaten by the evil Bergens, our leads set out to rescue them, and you can guess the rest of the story.Just about everything is bright and adorable, and the plot is punctuated with pop songs that range from Justin Timberlake to Earth, Wind & Fire. There are a couple original songs as well – my favorite is written by the duo behind last year's La La Land and Broadway's Dear Evan Hansen – and the big show-stopper is without a doubt the ubiquitous ""Can't Stop The Feeling!"".Despite featuring a whole lot of songs, though, Trolls is hardly a good musical. Very little of the music contributes to the story itself, and your enjoyment of the songs will come more from recognizing them than from their quality or what they accomplish for the story and characters. While this can work in another film, Trolls simply isn't strong enough to support itself under threat of its viewers thinking of something else. If you're not pulled in by the bright colors and flashy musical numbers, you'll sit there bored until you notice that you're only about 20 minutes in.It may appear unreasonable for me to care much about the quality of a kids' movie like this, but I want to hold DreamWorks Animation to a higher standard. They have put out some great work; their second film ever, The Prince of Egypt, features some of the best animation that I've seen in a movie, and the How To Train Your Dragon series has provided some of the best reasons for us to continue paying for 3D theater tickets. DreamWorks has been very hit-and-miss lately with their releases, though, and I would call this one a miss. Movies like Trolls, as well as Home from the year before it, just look lazy in comparison to what the studio can make.Overall, Trolls is innocent enough and is a fine movie to put on in front of kids; they'll be entertained by the colorful visuals, and it has a fine enough moral. You won't find much in terms of quality, though, and the movie ends up feeling about as plastic as the toys it is based on."
" Trolls
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,7,"Everyone recognises the popular toy Troll dolls, created by Thomas Dam, launched in 1959, becoming a fad craze again in the 1980s and 1990s, most popularly as pencil toppers. Well, it was only a matter of time before they were given a makeover and turned into a movie. Basically, Trolls are small creatures living in almost everlasting happiness, singing, dancing and hugging all day. While the large creatures, the Bergens, can never feel happy, only to discover that devouring a Troll can make them for happy for a moment. The Bergens hold an annual festival, called Trollstice, for all Bergens to gets its feeling of happiness, caging Trolls ready to be eaten. But the captured Trolls escape through underground tunnels, on the day that Bergen Prince Gristle Jr. would eat his first Troll. Twenty years later, the daughter of troll leader King Peppy (Jeffrey Tambor), the extremely happy and optimistic troll Princess Poppy (Anna Kendrick), throws a big party to celebrate the Trolls' escape. But grey troll Branch (Justin Timberlake), who has a secret crush on Poppy, warns that the loud parties will attract the Bergens. Branch's fears come true when Chef (Christine Baranski), who was banished from Bergen Town all those years ago, sees the Trolls' fireworks. He captures numbers of them; Poppy and others manage to hide, but none of the other Trolls dare to venture into Bergen Town to rescue their friends. Poppy initially goes to save the captured Trolls alone, but a reluctant Branch accompanies her. When they reach Bergen Town, the Bergens are preparing to hold Trollstice that night. They witness Troll hostage Creek (Russell Brand) apparently get eaten by now King Gristle Jr. (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), but Poppy is hopeful he survived. The rest of the Troll captives are being guarded by a Bergen scullery maid named Bridget (Zooey Deschanel), who Poppy and Branch discover is in love with Gristle Jr. The Trolls strike a deal with Bridget: if she helps to free them and confirm if Creek is alive, they will help her get a date with Gristle Jr. While setting Bridget up for a date, Poppy argues with Branch who refuses to sing. He reveals that as a child he caused his grandmother to be killed, after Chef found him because of his singing, he has blamed himself ever since, causing his colour to turn from blue to grey. Poppy comforts him, and Branch reluctantly agrees to help Bridget and the Trolls. Using their colourful long hair, the Trolls transform and disguise Bridget into Lady Glitter Sparkles, gaining the attention of Gristle Jr. They date at an arcade restaurant and roller rink, and he asks her to be his ""plus one"" at Trollstice, and mentions Creek, who is alive and being held captive. Returning to Bridget's room, Bridget asks the Trolls if they can help disguise her as Lady Glitter Sparkles at Trollstice. But they make her cry refusing, because they can no longer help, and the Trolls leave and attempt to rescue Creek. The Trolls are then captured by Chef, they are shocked to discover Creek had agreed with the Bergens to help them capture the rest of the Trolls, in exchange for not being eaten himself. Creek returns to the Troll village and uses a cowbell to bring out the rest of the hiding Trolls to be captured by Chef and the other Bergen cooks. With all the Trolls captured and soon to be eaten, Poppy loses all hope, she and the other Trolls turn grey. But Branch, who has been typically grumpy, sings for Poppy to cheer her up, and through the song confesses his love for her. Singing together, all the colours of the Trolls are restored, including Branch himself. Bridget is ready to sacrifice herself to save the Trolls, before they can be served, but Poppy does not want to abandon her Bergen friend. Poppy reveals that Bridget was Lady Glitter Sparkles, and says that Bergens don't need to eat Trolls to be happy, as Bridget and Gristle Jr. found happiness. The Bergens all participate in a sing and dance with the Trolls, making them feel happy. Chef refuses to accept the peace, and tries to kill Poppy and Branch. But Chef is sent rolling out of Bergen Town, with Creek, later to be eaten by a giant creature underneath them. The Trolls and the Bergens agree to live in peace, Poppy is crowned Queen of the Trolls, and she and Branch share a romantic hug. Also starring John Cleese as King Gristle Sr., Gwen Stefani as DJ Suki, and James Corden as Biggie. Timberlake and Kendrick are well chosen voicing and singing, as are the supporting cast members, DreamWorks purchased the Trolls brand and turned the Danish creatures into less ugly and more colourful critters. The result is a visually scrumptious and upbeat experience, featuring a surprisingly great soundtrack of songs, including the fantastic Oscar and Golden Globe nominated song ""Can't Stop the Feeling"" by Justin Timberlake, a most enjoyable family animated musical adventure. Very good!"
" Brings Back Memories To The 1980's Saturday Morning Cartoons
",2017-06-25 00:00:00,9,"Back in the 1950's an artist from Belgium named Peyo created those lovable blue-faced whimsical little creatures named The Smurfs. By the 1960's, a Danish woodcarver named Thomas Dam built a wooden doll for his young daughter, which like the Smurfs, would become a cultural icon better known as The Trolls. These cute little peculiar critters with their over-the-top pointy colourful hair have become one of the most popular toys in the 1960's and continued to have exceptional fame in the 1970's and again in the 1990's. It should come as no surprise that these iconic toys would be spawned into a full-length animated feature that inspires you to yearn for Saturday morning cartoons to come back so I can enjoy them with some sugary cereal.In their first animated feature (hopefully not their last) we see these cute little trolls, whose purpose in life is to be happy and spend their days dancing, hugging and singing jovial songs. It truly shows that the animators have taken this film by heart as they made the characters possess a softer, plushy skin complexion as opposed to the hard-plastic I remembered during the 1990's. It was also clever that the animators gave them generic clothing partially because naked trolls would not sit well the sensitive viewers. With the vibrant colours, the spontaneous musical numbers, the caressing and hugging, this will surely attract the younger audience, the adult with the inner child nostalgic for those 1980's cartoons or just anyone having a good time at the movies.Even though their village is permanently marked with glitter and happiness, they are an easy target to a group of unhappy goons known as the Bergens. They believe that the only way they can achieve happiness is if they must eat a Troll at a festival called Trollstice. As Bergen leader Prince Gristle (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) is about to indulge in some delightful Troll happiness, the Trolls rebel by evacuating from their homes. Twenty years later, the village of Bergen Town is equally wallowing in misery while the Trolls are in preparation to one of the biggest parties since their escape under the watchful eye of the most ecstatic and whimsical of the Trolls Princess Poppy (Anna Kendrick) not letting anything get in away even from the very pessimistic warnings from the gloomiest of the Trolls, Branch (Justin Timberlake). Their partying catches the attention from a witch-like Bergen named Chef (Christine Baranski) who ends up kidnapping them which lead to Poppy and Branch to go on a rescue mission.What makes this film truly stand out is that it works on plenty of nifty creative ways in its storytelling all the while succeeding in keeping the kids entertained for the next 90 minutes. It was cool that they juxtaposed classic songs like Funky Town and September and doctored it with rap remixes. Even the Bergens get some fun out of the music like Gorillaz' ""Sunshine in a Bag"" and Lionel Richie's ""Hello"". We do some fairy tale subplot involving Bergen scullery maid named Bridget (Zooey Deschanel) who is head-over-heels with Prince Gristle. Rounding out the impressive cast is John Cleese as the Bergen King was a pleasure as always and Russell Brand as hipster like Troll named Creek who later becomes a traitor to them.Sure the message is that happiness is not an outer beauty but an inner beauty is simple, it succeeds without falling victim of being preachy or rubbing it in our faces. And surely enough if you have kids they will have a ball with this movie and the adults will surely recall a time when watching cartoons as kids is truly a sign of our childhood innocence that will remain in our memories forever."
" Barely a movie
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,1,This movie is so fundamentally terrible it makes me want to rip off my foot and beat myself to death with it. I understand that this is a kids movie but that is no excuse for the complete lack of story or decently written dialogue or the disgusting art style that makes my eyes want to vomit. The soundtrack alone is enough to render john Williams unconscious. This movie is total garbage and painfully unfunny at times. I would recommend using the $10 you saved by not buying this movie from the bargain bin at Walmart to buy me some toothpicks that I could use to tear out the part of my brain that remembers this dsteaming pile of cat feces.
" A fun time with the kids
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,7,"YES... even fun for the adults. You'll ind yourself singing along during the movie.Now that its out of theaters, the kids are watching it near every day!An adventure with a lesson- Life is what you make you it! Friends sticking up for friends in the most colorful and musical of ways. LOL.Will leave you with a craving for cotton candy *wink* or a Chia Pet. :)"
" Fun for what it is
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,7,"This is a fun little silly kids movie. And it works really good. Again do not set any high bar or standard, just accept this for the animated fun that it is. And you don't even have to be a kid to enjoy it. There is enough for everyone. You shouldn't mind singing too much, though the songs are also very free and with Justin Timberlake at the helm you know you got a hit in the making.I actually knew one song before I had seen the movie. But that's just because it got very popular quickly. It may be the same for you. The story is simple and I wouldn't even really spoil anything, especially because it is very predictable. Just sit back and enjoy if you can and are willing too"
" I was surprised.
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,7,"I thought this movie was going to be a snore fest of non-stop stupidity, but I was surprised. It knew what it wanted to do, and it did that very well. It wanted to be a ""feel good"" movie, and it is. It's animation is awesome, very visually interesting and pleasing. There was some very talented voice acting and writing, and at certain times it can get a little dark. And i just love how the ending turned out. It was an ending that could've very well gone wrong, but they did it right."
" Justin Timberlake So Drastically Overshadows Anna Kendrick That You Can't Help Disliking Her Character
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,5,"Anna Kendrick's character is an obnoxiously giddy, shallow, empty-headed princess whom I grew to dislike so intensely that, even when she redeemed herself at the VERY END of the movie, I couldn't start liking her. Justin Timberlake's character, whose backstory amazingly requires that he not sing, is the only troll character with a personality and I loved him instantly. Timberlake's character's one featured song (True Colors) was a decidedly one-sided duet with Anna, who was more of a back-up singer than a partner, only singing on her own when the script called for her character to ""speak"" the words in the lyrics to Timberlake's character. Timberlake carries it well though, and the True Colors scene is one of those I find myself replaying on it's own just to listen to him sing it again.Reducing my rating by 5 stars is mostly due to my disappointment in the characters. But overall, this is (as others have said) a brightly colored pop jukebox musical that *mostly* leaves you feeling good (though at the end of the movie, I was still disappointed that Anna Kendrick's character wasn't swallowed up by one of the big fuzzy bugs).I don't watch entertainment movies, especially animated movies that target children, from an intellectual perspective. What's the point of being entertained if you're not willing or able to suspend disbelief AND intellect!? So I don't criticize jukebox musicals the way that some snobbish-sounding reviews do. If they contain songs I love that make my foot move involuntarily to the beat, I'm happy. So most of the credit for the 5 stars I did give goes to the movie's ability to do just that. It has great songs that make you feel good. This is definitely the kind of movie you can put on when you need a little boost in your mood."
" Its a decent movie
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,5,i like this movie its an OK movie but not the best movie dreamworks made i think that they can do better but still i liked the story but it felt like a big musical if u want good music go watch south park bigger longer and uncut that is at least a lot better and it has a message thats better.
" Disappointed with the language for a children's movie
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,5,"This movie is definitely intended for children. I'm disappointed with the language they insist on using for children's movies. In the first few minutes of the film they say ""Oh my God"". This language is not acceptable in my house, and I don't know why it can't be avoided in children's movies. My young daughter repeats things she hears in movies, as I'm sure a lot of other children do."
" An annoying, overly bright, and unfunny movie.
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,4,"Have you seen one of those television shows that shows a parody of a kids show? You know, the parodies that show only happiness, overly bright colors and obnoxious characters? Luckily, you only watch only about ten seconds of that, but try imagining watching an hour and half of that. It sounds painful and trust me, it is because that was a description of ""Trolls"" in a nutshell. This film is overly obnoxious, unimaginative and so annoying that I was really considered to stop watching the movie. However, I managed to get through it somehow. It was a very unpleasant watch and I still don't know how I did it, but I succeeded. Do you want to know how bad this film is? Well, I'll tell you.The story focuses on some creatures known as the trolls who are happy all year long and do nothing but sing, dance, and hug every single day. They hide from very grumpy creatures called the bergen, who used to eat a troll every single year so they can experience happiness which they never experience. One day though, the former Chef Bergen (Christine Baranski) finds the Trolls and captures most of them so she can bring them to the King of Bergen Town, Gristle (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) who has never experience happiness in his life. Shocked by the capture of her friends, the happy-go-lucky princess of the trolls, Poppy (Anna Kendrick) teams up with a stick in the mud troll named Branch (Justin Timberlake) to go rescue her friends. And that's it. You can probably guess the story from there.The story is one of the major problems with the movie. It's not only predictable, but also unoriginal as we have seen the story of a happy-go-lucky character team up with a stick in the mud character many times before in the past, with some movies doing the story much better. The characters are also obnoxious. The two main characters are both heavily unlikable. Poppy is so obnoxiously annoying for being happy-go-lucky throughout the majority of the movie and not really having anything funny to say or do. Branch on the hand, is unlikable for being a jerk constantly. He doesn't really have a personality other than being a jerk and the reason for him being this way is so ridiculous that I actually burst out laughing because I thought it was so stupid. That was the only laugh I actually got from the movie, but not for the right reasons. I forgot to mention that the movie was a jukebox musical. It doesn't sound that bad, I mean it does have some pretty good songs like ""September"" by Earth, Wind, and Fire, but trust me, they're not pleasant to the ears. The songs are glossed with auto-tune which is the very definition of ear poison. Not only is it horrible to listen to, but it also wastes actual singing talents like Anna Kendrick who we have seen sing rather well in movies like ""Pitch Perfect."" So, after all my complaints is there anything good in this movie? Well, I can name a few things. The animation is great. Even though it did become irritating after awhile for being to bright and colorful throughout the whole movie with nothing dark in it whatsoever. it looks like actually objects you usually use when you make a scrapbook reminding a lot of those Nintendo yarn games like ""Kirby's Epic Yarn'. I also did like two of the characters in the movie. I enjoyed the characters of King Gristle and Bridget (Zooey Deschanel) and I also like their romance subplot that they had. Even though, it was basically a rehashed version of Cinderella, I thought it was cute.Other than that, ""Trolls"" was a pretty painful movie to watch. It was so bright, so annoying and so obnoxious that I'm baffled that DreamWorks thought it was suitable for a wide release. I don't know what else to say about this film, it's just bad. Now I'm going to rest my eyes for now so I'll be able to review my next movie. I'm just happy I didn't bleach them."
" Better than it had any right to be
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,6,"If nothing else, ""Trolls"" rally capitalizes on the sweetness of Anna Kendrick' she shares a nice chemistry with Justin Timberlake in the movie, but she also has the pretty singing voice to match. And it's a voice that's right at home with the candy-colored visuals (seriously, it feels like your eyeballs are snorting Pixy Stix).The real surprise is in the story's depth (a kids movie that urges an appreciation for what you have is downright novel, these days), but it's an enjoyable ride throughout. The songs are good, the humor is more hit than miss, and the talent involved is evident. The replay value (for me) doesn't seem all that high, but it's a nice surprise. Considering the tchotchke source material, I don't think anyone was expecting much. If anything.6/10"
" I didn't like it
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,3,"The only reason I saw this movie is because my friend took me to the movie theater and I hardly ever get to go so it was a special treat for me. I asked her what movie we were seeing and she said Trolls.I already had a feeling I wasn't going to like this movie, but I thought I might give it a shot.The plot is pretty dumb. It's about these trolls that sing and dance all the time and hide from ogres to avoid being eaten. Pretty basic and simple and dumb plot. This movie was also trying WAY TOO HARD to be funny. I didn't have a real laugh once. I might have forced some fake laughs but that's about it. I couldn't stand the jokes. That cloud guy was extremely stupid. It was a stupid character that had legs and and wore socks but no shoes. It is just pure garbage! And I can't stand the troll that has sparkles come out of its butt! Honestly, most of the jokes are just annoying and not funny. What are they trying to put in kids heads?I know its intended for little kids, but I'm imagining myself watching this as a little kid, and I'm still not liking it.I only gave it 4 stars because I kind of liked the little love story between the king ogre and the servant ogre. I also didn't mind the main character she is the one that make the movie watchable."
" cute, but unoriginal
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,5,"I enjoyed the animation this movie delivers, but was disappointed with the lack of originality.the Trolls themselves were someone else's creation; I recognized parts of the background music from an original soundtrack created by Trent Reznor for another the movie, The Social Network's row boat scene; all the songs the trolls sang were popular hits.this movie was just a conglomeration of other people's original work; why couldn't they put in, at least, one original song?"
" ""True Colors"" Cupcakes & Rainbows-Singing Dancing & Hugs...What's Not to Like?
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,8,"Happiness is a Warm Troll according to the ""Bergens"" the Nemesis of the Ever Singing, Dancing, Hugging Trolls. They are the Embodiment of Happy, at least Most of Them.A Troll Named ""Branch"" (Justin Timberlake) is the Exception. He is a ""Prepper"", a Survivalist that Fears that the there is a Bergen Under Every Bush and He has No Time for Partying like ""Poppy"" (Anna Kendrick) and the rest of the Trolls.That's the Set-Up for this Dreamworks Animated Movie. The Trolls have been Spotted In and Out of Pop Culture since around 1958 (created by Thomas Dam as a makeshift Christmas gift for his daughter).This is a Movie with ""True Colors"", to say the least. It Explodes with Color, Sparkle, Glitter, Cupcakes, and Rainbows virtually Non-Stop.While the Troll Camp and the Bergen Village that Bookend the Movie are Generic, but Fun and Repetitive at times, the most Creative of the Three Acts is the Second as our Two Adventurers Travel to the Rescue through Scary Forests and Encounter some Bizarre, Nightmarish, and Funny Creatures.Overall, it's a Low-Concept Movie with a Number of Highlights and can be Enjoyed by All Ages but is Specifically Toned for the Ultra-Young.Its Eye Candy is Impressive, the Jokes Work for the most part, and the Pop Songs (spanning many decades) are Surprisingly quite Acceptable for even Musical Interlude Haters."
" Songs an adult can enjoy...finally
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,8,"This movie is the definition of today's POP culture including the songs, colors, animation and plot. It's a simple plot and it sticks the landing. Like good kids animation does, both motion or book form, it does not attempt to be realistic. It's a cute story that is fast paced and as an adult, it mixes new and old songs that were perfect for the movie and very good remixes, to the point I could actually listen to these songs in the car with my children verses ""Let it Snow"" or ""Do you want to build a snowman"" which make me want to jam ice-picks in my ears. I'm not a fan of the most recent Disney movies (i.e. Frozen) plots or songs. This movie does not try to cram complex concepts like the death of parents or falling in love in 5 minutes which leaves gaping plot holes, from an adult perspective. It's not trying to be grandiose. It's a kid movie told on kid level with enough nostalgia to rope parents in who are in their 30's and 40's. Think old school cartoons Smurfs and Gummy Bears crammed into one told with modern animation and songs."
" loved it
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,8,"I took my 4 year old to the cinema to watch this. We laughed, we cried, we sang along, we bought the DVD and have watched it several times a day since. I'm still not bored of watching it. Christine Baranski is brilliant and worth watching it alone for. The rest of the cast is brilliant too. The music selection complements the action very well, and we had to get the soundtrack the moment we got home."
" It's a great movie for everyone
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,8,"I've read some reviews and to be honest some take this movie WAY TOO FAR and it's not a fair review for what is a really good movie for your family and/or children to really enjoy. As far as some characters that people can ""relate to"" in a kids movie and making a review comparing them to themselves and their life and how a certain character sends a wrong message is absurd and a little too much. THIS IS A KIDS MOVIE!! It doesn't send any bad messages whatsoever. My 5 year old loves it and I do too really. It's very funny, has good music, characters are unique and colorful. Only thing negative is the darkness in some of the Bergens and that they remind me of the movie Boxtrolls which I couldn't stand. But, they don't ruin the movie at all and I can live with most of them. Anna Kendrick can really sing and I had no idea she had that in her and of course Timberlake was great. I highly recommend this movie! In no way does it deserve anything under a 7/10!"
" Fun Family Film
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,8,"So after reading a lot of negative reviews I decided to give my input. This film is very fun for every age. One downfall of this movie is that every troll (except for Branch) is exactly the same with no real different personalities. Also I wish they would have made this film a little more emotional (except for the final scene). I say this because I don't feel like the trolls were ever in any real danger. However, after saying all that I really enjoyed this film and so did my entire family. I also loved the music in this film. Justim Timberlake did an amazing job."
" Family fun
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,10,"Keep in mind, this is a movie intended for kids!!! If you find singing in movies annoying, this isn't for you, but kids love it for the most part. I know mine did and I even liked it. Perfect for family night, if you are old school like I am. It is a refreshing tale of semi unique features that teaches courage, kindness and that its okay to be you. Very family friendly, cute and sparkly!"
" Garbage
",2017-03-02 00:00:00,1,"It disappoints even the lowest expectations. Has absolutely no value and seems like a poor attempt to invoke 90s nostalgia, while being targeted at little kids born after 2010. I couldn't stand 5 minutes of it.Kids who like shiny colors may like it."
" Good but Bad
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,7,"In the 1990's were a famous toy line of small Troll dolls with bug-eyes and frizzy colorful hair despite still looking the same in design that still creeps me out today. A decade later DreamWorks Animation Studios said to themselves that this deserves a movie.I have some opinions that i found both good and bad about it, and I may be wrong but it can still count. The movie has it's moments were characters can be funny, annoying, cute...maybe too cute. This movie's animation I love about it with it's fluffy feeling about it that reminds me of walking through a Toys R Us and in a colorful teddy bear aisle.The characters I mostly relate to Branch (Justin Timberlake) with his grouchy attitude, paranoid for danger, and isn't a parting type especially a scene where he throws a guitar in a fire, I snickered. The main character Poppy (Anna Kendrick) is always enthusiastic, creative, and is an amazing singer, despite all those features she still shows emotion that still makes me enjoy them the most.The Story feels like a reminder with a Lord of The Rings like adventure with the two main characters Poppy and Branch attempting to rescue other trolls from ogres that eat them to feel happy, that is sad. The plot still feels like another Dreamworks plot what reminds me of Croods, Puss in Boots, and Madagascar, but still feels good with their execution.Personally I am starting to get sick when it comes to animated children's films that decide to put in new trendy songs like how a teaser for this had the whip song which was a huge insult actually.This movie features some and it's own song ""I got this feeling"" by Justin Timberlake (Voice actor of Branch)The humor can be both annoying and reused throughout the film while some can make me crack up so the comedy is a minimum.Overall, the movie was good with cute and creative characters and animation that i thought was still appreciative by DreamWorks as usual. I would recommend this movie for a quick watch and enjoy the concept of what it brings with the music it brings."
" My kids seemed to like this OK
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,5,"My kids seemed to like this OK. It wasn't too scary for my sensitive 8yo girl and yet I should have known better when my 6yo boy said he figured it out and ""didn't want to ruin it for us."" The intro to the situation and characters was interesting enough, but about half way through I wanted it to end. You may enjoy it more than me if you like pop music videos and lots of trippy animation. I was hoping for some laughs, but left with only a couple chuckles. I gave this a 5/10 and would skip it on family movie night at home. You'd probably be better off just buying the soundtrack if people still do that kind of thing?"
" Awesome Kids movie
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,8,If you are looking for an educational movie the title Trolls should have already detoured you. It is a kid friendly family movie me and my husband were both able to sit through the entire thing without just despising it. Very colorful and upbeat which kept all 5 of my kiddos ages 5mon-6yr entertained. It was a good children's movie that I will probably purchase.
" Good enough
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,4,"In a way, Trolls is a musical. There was too much singing, that eventually got tiring. But other than that, it was a cute movie. The one thing (other than singing) that put me off at first, was the troll eating (I mean, wasn't this supposed to be a children movie? if I was a kid, I would have been a little scared by that). But the story unfolds quite smoothly after that, and so the whole eating thing was nicely explained. Another negative was the many (many!) weird creatures. There were the trolls and their enemies, some talking clouds, not to mention all these creatures that wanted to eat the lead character. Other than that, the story was cute and the animation was very colourful and had a happy feeling and positive message. So, my rating is 4 out of 10 for Trolls."
" fun silly movie
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,7,"yes, this is a movie for young viewers, but it is fun. silliness and a simple story. but frankly we don't have enough of them in this movie era. the colors are great, the animation is fun and frankly as an adult, i did enjoy it. this movie is pure escape. it is fun to hear the voices of such esteemed actors playing such fun characters. Sometimes i think so many reviewers feel they must pan movies as they don't relay various critical standards.. However, this one isn't one. i like many types of movies and this is one of them. a purely fun and colorful take on things. enjoy it for what it is and don't over think it! not all movies need that. it is great for kids and adults if you look at it as being simply fun! i am well over 21 and liked it very much!"
" Far too sweet. makes it weak.
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,5,"So I did not realize that trolls are still popular. I remember all the Tweens had at least one back when I was in jr. High a long time ago, but now I can see from this movie how diverse the toy line has gotten, in their plot to sell them to the masses.This movie shoves so much sugar into my throat I thought my teeth were going to rot. It's like some one just poured a big bag of it into some Kool Aid and you have to ask yourself do you like Kool Aid or the big sugar rush you just got?And by sugar, I'm talking about the parade of pop songs. The music is good, how could in not be when you got Justin Timberlake singing. Ana Kendrick is pretty good too starting us out off the bat with two original songs (possibly the only two)the film produces.The animation is really, really, I mean really colorful. Blindingly colorful once again used as fluff to sugarcoat the fact that the movie really has no substance.It's kinda insulting the lack of actual effort I'm getting from this animation.I'm not really into musicals but my mind is an open book. Trolls did nothing to change my mind on the musical. The songs are really good but I got little from it. Most likely because the film also uses some stock classics with very few original songs. I kinda hate it when musicals do that. Stop taking other people's songs and write your own for the movie.Hearing Timberlake and Kendrick duet off of True colors was beautiful, but would be just as satisfying hearing them do it on a soundtrack versus watching their voices come out of the Trolls.Just a little too pop perfect."
" like the trolls, not the eating
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,6,"Trolls are happy little singing creatures and Bergens are a large miserable species. The Bergens discovered that eating Trolls gives them happiness. Each year, the Bergens hold a Trollstice festival where they eat Trolls to be happy. It's prince Gristle's first Trollstice but the Trolls escape. Chef (Christine Baranski) is blamed and banished. Twenty years later, Trolls are carefree. Poppy (Anna Kendrick) holds a noisy party while Branch (Justin Timberlake) warns of discovery by the Bergens. They are discovered by Chef and some are taken. Poppy tries to rescue them with reluctant help from Branch. Gristle (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) has since become king. His maid Bridget (Zooey Deschanel) secretly has a crush on him.Surprisingly, I like the Trolls. I like their bright colors and penchant for singing pop songs. The Bergens are fine and the lesson to be happy actually works. I do have a problem with eating the Trolls. It's very creepy and ill-fitting for a kids movie. There has to be another way to make the concept less horrific. Maybe they could simply absorb the happy energy leaving the Trolls asleep. It's a hard thing to get over and get comfortable with."
" One of the best movies ever!
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,10,Trolls is a movie about courage and friendship as well as forgiveness and understanding each other:) they did an amazing job with the music and theatrical parts of this film. it was touching at times and fun at others. at the end of the day everyone finds true happiness and music is a big part of the celebration. What could be better than that!!!! love love love this film and highly recommend it to everyone at any age:)
" Humorless, Creepy, And Boring For All Ages
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,1,"Given the cuteness of the wacky-looking and iconic little 1960s Troll dolls, there were infinite possibilities for a lively and fun-filled movie adaptation—along the lines of Toy Story.Instead, children and their parent are given a mawkish and edgy fractured fairy tale. The creators try to prop up this train wreck with a lot of psychedelic razzle-dazzle computer graphics, dancing, and gratuitous pop music adaptations – From Simon and Garfunkel to Percy Faith. Nevertheless, though the CG is rich in lively colors and choreographed scenes, the dreadful story is humorless shades of gray.The film starts out with very creepy characters called the Bergens whose only joy in life is to eat Trolls on – believe it or not – ""Trollstice."" Really? Maybe the title should have been something stolen from the Twilight Zone, i.e. ""To Serve Trolls."" This is not a terribly engaging or buoyant start, and too dark for younger audiences. It goes downhill from there when we learn that a lead character's grandmother was eaten by a Bergen long ago. And so he's a pouting Grinch through most of the movie. An insufferable 90 minutes of screen time is wasted on learning how the Trolls avoid being the next dinner entrée. This long-winded tale of forgiveness and redemption is lost on children and a dragged-out bore for adults. Unlike such contemporary animation classics as Shrek, there is only squandered energy in this film. There is nothing terribly humorous, no cadence of seat-of-pants action scenes, no slapstick comedy relief. The only running gag is a sparkle Troll that sprays enemies with glitter, like is some secret James Bond weapon. And, a hippy-dippy cloud that makes a slightly amusing cameo. This film is so anemic, it is light-years from anything ever created by the Disney geniuses - a dismal failure of imagination, simple playfulness, and comic relief."

" I have to confess I really enjoyed it!
",2017-02-18 00:00:00,7,I expected this to be another identikit kids animated movie like we've seen so many times before over the years. You know....typical cash in on a franchise or trend doing the rounds at that time.However I will admit I really did enjoy this movie. It has some great music in it. Some unexpected (and great!) 80s covers included throughout and overall it did have some great dialogue and funny little moments mixed in there.Yeah so the story is pretty predictable but the voice talent and the animation carries it off so well you don't mind so much.Its not gonna win any awards but there are worse ways to spend an afternoon with your kids.
" Great Kids Movie!
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,10,"We went to the theatre to watch that movie me and my 3year old daughter. We enjoyed the 3D experience. We bought the DVD and we've been watching it over and over since! The songs are very good! The French translation and songs translation is very bad, some songs there's just the music going on without signing loll seriously! We love the remix song of True Colors!!! Its our favourite part. !!!"
" Why would kids think nightclubs and being eaten alive are fun?
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,2,"My five-year old and four-year old did not like this film for several reasons.1) Constant scary creatures trying to eat the Trolls is the only excitement, and it's basically a bit too scary for them.2) Parties which involve DJs, dancing, and disco lights are not parties by my kids' reckoning. That's a party for people between the ages of 15- 25 only. The Trolls were hardcore clubbers. My five-year-old, not so much.3) There were three times my kids laughed. That's not enough. The trailer for Despicable Me 3 had more laughs.4) Nothing *cool* happened expect a Troll hitting a spider in the head with a frying pan. 5) The Trolls were superficial idiots. My kids *got* that and neither is in Year One yet."
" Glitter, and more Glitter...HUG TIME
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,7,"Justin Timberlake is a well known singer/songwriter, with his all time hit song being, ""Can't Stop the Feeling."" His recent appearance in the movie ""Trolls"" capitalized on that. The movie runs song after song, featuring the mentioned song as the ending notes of joy. I'm fifteen. I think that this wasn't a waste of time and money. I have little brothers. They would watch this movie 10 times if they could. Making my feelings towards the movie above par. As a fan of music, I appreciated the songs that were both featured and played. Justin did a great job working with other artists such as Ariana Grande to come up with the movie's melodic soundtrack. Anna Kendrick definitely sings her handful of the music, with the majority of them being upbeat, live life to the fullest sort of songs. This is great if you enjoy a catchy song that gets stuck in your head throughout the day. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy a song played on loop every now and then. This movie was a very predictable movie, with having nearly everything being wrapped in a nice, glitter-filled bow. When the inciting event came around, I could think for one minute and depict how the movie would end. But, I guess it was nice to listen to all the songs whilst my prediction unfolded. I think that if you are a child who is looking for a fairly humorous, childish movie, then ""Trolls"" is your film. A mom who has children should consider this movie for a fun weekend with the kids. Who knows? Maybe she will have a nice song stuck in her head too. I would suggest this movie for all who would like some laughs and a catchy tune."
" A Bombardment of Pure Joy and Happiness
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,9,"I don't know what's wrong with those people who gave this movie a rating below 7, but they definitely need professional help. Cause if you don't feel that this movie is great, then there must be something really broken inside you! This movie gave us nothing but beautiful music, great adventures, hilarious comedy, with a little hint of fairy tale inserted (Hello, Cinderella!). It also gave us a strong moral lesson, which is to never give up hope in any kind of bad situation. It also tell us to be brave, kind, and always try to see the bright side in everything. How can it be called anything except amazing? I'm a guy, but I'm deeply touched when I saw Poppy's sadness killing her happiness, turning her whole body grey but then Branch started healing her and reviving her colors back. I have to admit I cried when I witnessed that heartwarming event. The songs which were picked for this movie is spot on! Each and every one of them brushed this movie with joy, thrill, and spirit. This animation movie is nearly perfect in every aspect. If you want to feel happy, then you definitely need to watch this movie."
" To Troll or Not to Troll
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,1,"The only reason I can think anyone would rate this anything but zero (or one star, in IMDb) is for trolling purposes, i.e., to induce other people that haven't utterly and completely wasted their time to go and waste it.The upside (yes, it has an up side, that's why it manages to not be the worst film I've ever seen) is that it DOESN'T have original songs (or, so says my wife, which recognised most of the songs). Take Disney's ""Moana"", for example, all original songs, and all either annoying or unfitting. This film managed to fit several known songs in the context of the story, including Cyndi Lauper's ""True Colors"" (the only song I recognised), what absolutely doesn't mean the songs were not annoying (yeah, I like ""True Colors"", but then again, who doesn't?)The story is a wild exploitation of the Cinderella tale, mixed up with the Smurfs cartoons and ""Xanadu"", the musical film, and generally doesn't make much sense, altogether.The ending is made obvious in the first few minutes, when the soon-to-be first-and-only love of the then child spoiled prince appears on screen as a faded servant in the castle.The story is very straight forward, with an unimportant twist of making one extremely unimportant character turn on his friends for his unimportant life (it could've been any other character, it wouldn't make any difference, maybe it could have made the twist more ""twisty"" if it had been a more significant character, but then again, what for?)Not being a Disney film, two characters actually seem to die in flames, although that's not explicitly shown, but I felt better thinking the circumstanced villains were gruesomely dead, burned alive, to never return in ""Trolls 2"".The film ends literally where it starts, on the tree of the trolls, in the city of their foes. Citing Grug (The Croods), it's a long and sucky walk, in a circle. There wasn't a single laugh (or even a chuckle, or a smirk) during the whole film, or thrills, or emotions, other than boredom and an actual sense of shame for being watching it (except for ""True Colors"", which amazingly fits on the scene and in the plot).I really don't understand why this film was produced. Just to sell some toys?! I can't believe people would spend money doing that!"
" Very mildly amusing.
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,5,"'TROLLS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A computer-animated kids' flick, based on the popular dolls (of the same name). It's a musical-comedy-adventure, about two trolls who attempt to rescue their friends from giant creatures, known as the Bergen, that eat trolls in order to be happy. The film stars the voice talents of Anna Kendrick, Justin Timberlake, Zooey Deschanel, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Christine Baranski, Russell Brand, James Corden and Jeffrey Tambor. It was directed by Mike Mitchell (who also directed the 2010 computer-animated hit 'SHREK FOREVER AFTER') and Walt Dohrn. and it was scripted by Erica Rivinoja, Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger (based on the dolls by Thomas Dam). The movie was a hit at the Box Office, and it's received mostly positive reviews from critics. I thought it was OK. Trolls are creatures who are always happy, and they're constantly singing, dancing and hugging. The Bergen are much larger creatures, that are never happy; and the only way they can ever be happy (briefly), or so they believe, is to eat trolls. The trolls had been imprisoned by the Bergen, but they escaped. Now they've been located again, and several are captured. Two trolls set out to save their captured friends. The movie is colorful, and always visually pleasant to look at. It's also filled with catchy, and very upbeat, music, and it will probably make most children laugh. There's not a lot in it to entertain adults though, but it is a pretty well made kids' film. I found it to be very mildly amusing.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/xGBv2IpDjDc"
" The Vidiot Reviews...
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,4,"TrollsTroll Dolls were only fun to play with as a toy when you had a bag of firecrackers. And while none of the imps in this animated-musical explode, they do sparkle.When the troll princess (Anna Kendrick) celebrates her tiny touchy feely tribes (Russell Brand, James Corden, Gwen Stefani) liberation from the unemotional Bergens 20 years ago, their singing and dancing attracts their former captors.Now, her eternally optimistic highness must work alongside naysayer troll Branch (Justin Timberlake) in order to save her subjects from becoming dinner.Glamming up an ugly chambermaid (Zooey Deschanel), the trolls set out to seduce the Bergen king (Christopher Mintz-Plasse).Butchering an array of classic songs that kids will no doubt accredit to this saccharine adaptation of the wild haired figurines, Trolls' boilerplate storyline and Smurf-like characterization is the opposite of its somewhat inventive animation.Incidentally, trolls actually live under bridges and eat suicide jumpers.

" Terrible plot and message for kids
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,2,"This is going to be my first review, I reopened my account just for this. I must say that I am disgusted by the terrible message this movie gives off for young insecure and impressionable people. I had a really nice time with the movie for a while, but only because I could relate heavily to the slightly pessimistic lone wolf troll called Branch. It was such a nice breath of fresh air to see a character not being ""perfect"" according to society's norms these days. Branch is a loner who seems to be at his best when enjoying his own company, he is organized and he has made an effort to stockpile resources for the future years, while all the other trolls just partied and socialized until it became their downfall. This movie is an introvert's nightmare. It quickly becomes clear they wanted to portray that it is not okay for branch to not want to party and socialize all the time, he is presented as weird and none of the other trolls really want to interact with Branch because he is not like them. I wanted to be sick, when I realized that Branch had to have a tragic background story to be the cause of his ""terrible and wrong"" personality. People are not all the same. There are optimists and pessimists, extroverts and introverts, good days and bad days. Portraying that the only right way to be, is to be outgoing, social, physical and to party all day long, could easily make kids feel even more pressure to be perfect according to society. Like there isn't enough pressure from the rest of the entertainment industry on kids already. Kids are already bombarded through music lyrics and videos and through social media. This movie should have celebrated diversity and realized that there are many ways to be happy and to enjoy life. Beside the message that diversity is wrong and that you all must be mindless indoctrinated dancing candy floss puppets, the movie had an extremely weak plot. The unhappy Bergen want to eat the trolls in order to find happiness (very not so subtle metaphor for us that antidepressants and other addictive substances are bad for you and wont give you true happiness, as we know, dancing singing and socializing is the only way for one to achieve that), trolls get snatched and brought to Bergen town cause of their careless nature. Remaining trolls eat all of Branch's stockpile of food in his secret bunker and do nothing. Branch and Poppy go to Bergen town and rescue the kidnapped trolls and of course implement their propaganda upon the inhabitants, freeing them from their chains of despair through dancing. Oh, and Branch becomes like all the other trolls – ""One of us, one of us, one of us"", *creepy brainwashed stare*I would recommend The Lion King if you want to learn a thing or two about life, and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs if you enjoy movies containing characters with different personalities (Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey).2/10 for the visuals."
" The message was about teaching the truth behind falsified believes.
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"This is a good film than how it was labelled. At least I enjoyed it, despite being an adult, particularly a male and a bachelor. It looks more a little kids' film than for anyone else. Because the film was based on the famous dolls. Usually film comes first and then follows its dolls to the markets. But this film has a reverse concept and a very much acceptable. Yes, it was not great as Disney's or Pixar's animations, but the DreamWorks animation is always there behind these two, considered the third best and according to that limit, you should expect the film.It's a musical like most of the animations are and one of the tracks made into the 2017 Oscars for best film songs list, but the film did not make into best the animated feature. Directed by the director of one of the sequels of 'Shrek' series. Technically, it sounds awesome with cute character models, colours, songs, music and particularly the voice-overs. The story wise, it's not bad, except the concept of eating trolls makes the real young kids go fright.Good for families and even better if you choose to watch it in digital 3D format. The runtime was good with a fine pace. In the line of smurfs, gnomes, fairies, and now these trolls to add in the list for children to watch growing up. Don't bother watching it if you are an adult and only like and enjoy adult films, other than seeing it neutral, as well as opinioning. Purely an entertaining film and I strongly suggest it for the little ones.7/10"
" Sorry to be a 'Troll', but...
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,5,"Just the other day, I was debating with myself: why don't I enjoy the film Groundhog Day anywhere near as much as I used to? Bill Murray is hilarious, the plot is hugely original, so could my problem be?Then the reason became clear: It's the ending. Isn't Murray far more appealing as the sarcastic, wise-crack jerk he is at the start, than the all-loving, all-generous good Samaritan he is by the movie's close? No wonder I always turn it off twenty minutes from the end when I rewatch it... the dilution of this sardonic icon into a walking, talking Care Bear is too much for my fragile brain to endure.Now we have Trolls, which has a similarly detached individual, in an animated picture full of hugging, dancing, and unbearably cheesy songs (both original, and covers). Guess what? He's the only tolerable one among these big-haired, auto-tuned, singing little munchkins... So, I wonder what'll happen to him...Yep, it's Groundhog Day all over again (pun intended) as sweetness and rainbows are GOOD, and sarcasm and cynicism are BAD. Pur-lease. The same tragic brainwashing even befalls to a group of fierce ogres, who have their nice, metropolitan cityscape transformed into a garish, multi-coloured nightmare. I hope they have sunglasses for when they wake up every morning.So, the upshot is: You can keep your glitter-pooping trolls and your break-dancing ogres, I'll stick with the REAL interpretation of those monsters e.g The ones that live under the bridge, and the ones that'll break your bones to make their bread. Or, something. If that means I walk about with a raincloud over my head forever, so be it. Far more preferable than being a happy-clappy, hippy conformist, any day.

",2017-01-30 00:00:00,10,"I didn't intend to watch this movie but my kids wanted to see it. I was doing other stuff while they were watching it and somehow I got into it. The songs were really nice with some new ones and some covers of 80s songs. The story is pretty basic but the dialogue is very funny. Cooper made me laugh out loud with his sparse lines. Its too bad that we didn't get to know each of the trolls as they seem all interesting. The movie is not that long so I guess there was not enough time to flesh them out.Overall, its a light-hearted fun movie which will put you in a good mood... if you give it a chance."
" Disturbing and Immature
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,1,"Pros: One song is okay if you close your eyes and ignore the movie, during the course of this song the main character is eaten at least 3 times by various plants and monsters. All of this is colorful and ""fun"" of course.Cons: Just because you add rainbows and glitter doesn't mean that it's okay for the main character to be eaten and decapitated in a children's movie.The antagonists are raunchy and immature and eat the protagonists. They are shown eating the protagonists and this is a key plot point. Kids who can pick up on that will not be distracted by the fancy colors.We don't enjoy watching nasty creatures give each other wedgies and kick each others butts while naked trolls fart glitter.Walked out 30 minutes into the movie and even that was too much."

The themes in this film are pretty great but the execution of the film not so much. From the beginning to the end there are a number or sing and dance along's that were only in the movie to pass time. There are a lot of good things in the film and a lot of bad one's, however the number of bad ones are heavier. Overall, this film tried to be for adults and kids but failed.

Definitely a movie worth watching at home with your family. Teenagers won't probably like this much, but young ones and their parents will absolutely love it. Considering the fact they're not a Disney fanatic. I actually had to buy the soundtrack album because the songs were so good. Love Justin Timberlake's voice and ability to put his soul into his singing. Now a days movies for adults, like action, comedies, horror, just plain suck. The only kind of excitement I get, or movies that I like, is from kids movies. That is just sad. So sad."
" Fabulous film for kids, might be the summer movie of 2017
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,6,"I've seen them all from Shrek, Finding Dory, Ice Age, Madagascar, Toy Story, there's no animated movie I haven't seen. I think Wall E is my all time favourite as the story is very well produced and has many adult themes, but can very easily be understood and liked by kids who may not see all the nuances in the story, but would enjoy it anyway. Ice age is my next favourite for similar reasons and I think like old time fairy tales it can teach kids a lot about family, friends, staying positive, reaching goals etc etc. I love all of them for the same and sometimes different reasons but sadly Trolls will never be in the favourite list. It's a fabulous movie, the colours and textures, the designs and the warm fluffy feel, the farting (and ejaculating!) glitter and poo-ing cupcakes are all (mostly) right on the level of young kids up to maybe 10 years old. The singing and hugging and trendy chat are all going to be spot on for that age group and the story of course is traditional: beautiful people hurt by nasty villains fight back and win. However I would be extremely surprised if many adults liked this on an adult level. It's cutesy and lovable and if I had little ones I'd definitely take them and enjoy the film, but I would never watch it on my own (except for reviewing it) and I'd never watch it again as I have done with most of the others. I think most kids will be entranced, will maybe learn a song or too, and for smaller ones I can imagine the DVD being played over and over again. I gave it a 6 out of 10 partly because of the sexual references that I just think have no place in a kids movie, otherwise it would have easily got an 8."

It's a musical which you would expect since Justin Timeberlake and Annna Kendrick are the 2 leads. Every now and then, a somewhat sexual innuendo will pop up but honestly it took me a few times to watch it in order to catch them. While I may be sick of, simply because my 3 year old refuses to watch anything else, it's actually a cute little movie and keeps the kids entertained. I recommend parents show this their children and just hope they don't get as addicted to it as mine have."
" Not deep, but surprisingly fun, even if you're not a kid
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,8,"While most professional critics were pretty hard on 'Trolls', attacking it's forced upbeat tone and synthetic nature, and while I can understand those comments and more importantly that it lacks the depth and risk-taking of the very best animated films, I can't dismiss the bottom line that I had a very good time watching this, laughing out loud a number of times. Basically the Trolls are an absurdly happy lot, whereas the comparatively giant Bergens are miserable by nature. Except when they eat a Troll. Then they briefly become happy before falling back into malaise. Hence, conflict! :-)There are some very funny, witty lines, some great character designs, some effective animated slapstick, and some clever, slightly twisted use of songs from the 70s and 80s. Yes, cynically those songs were probably used to help the adults in the audience who brought their kids, but they work really well in the context of the film. This IS a film aimed at younger kids. It doesn't have the more sophisticated plot and character twists of – for example – the Pixar films. But it does have a good heart and a silly sense of humor (and even a nice message), and – at least on the night I saw it – that was enough for this old guy (and my wife), both a good 10 times older than the audience this was aimed at."
" Love the positive vibes and creative, colorful animation! Instant good mood!
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,9,"I'm a 30 year old man, so probably not what the producers envisioned as their primary market, but I still love this movie!Being a raver at heart, it's fun to watch these troll live in the ultimate psychedelic fantasy. With non-stop music, dancing, hugs, and trippy hairdos, these Trolls know how to keep it PLUR! I'm not usually a big fan of musicals, but this movie has a nice variety of songs and keeps them short, fun, and too the point. Never a moment to get bored. Most of the songs are very cliché, generic, pop songs, but they are catchy and upbeat, so it's hard to complain.Anna Kendrick and Justin Timberlake have great chemistry and put a lot of personality into the characters. I think they nailed it.I feel like the team that made this movie did a great job collaborating between the writing, acting, and animation to create lots of really great moments for characters that a truly hilarious. Unlike most comedies, this one seems to get funnier each time I watch it. I can't get enough of the fun characters and find myself smiling throughout the day thinking of the great moments in this film.Creative musical numbers like ""Sounds of Darkness"" perfectly complement hilarious comedy scenes like the encounter with M. Cloud, and lead me to believe that the guys who directed this movie have a lot of talent. I'm surprised this film doesn't have a higher rating. I really can't think of what is not to like, but I'm guessing it's just one of those things where you either love it or hate it. I can see it becoming somewhat of a cult classic. I really hope it made enough money that we will get to see a sequel!"
" Family fun
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,7,"Trolls is not the best animated movie out there, nor the most original plot out there, nor has the most outrageous characters out there. However, Trolls is family fun and has both fun and heart. The main thing is that the movie doesn't pretend to be anything or take itself seriously.The message is simple but powerful: there is always a reason to smile and be happy, even in the saddest moments you can find a glimpse of light to lift you up. Some people are grumpy because they are sad inside. Your people is important, so you care for and take care of them.The movie is gorgeous regarding coloring and texturing.The characters are likable, albeit a bit simplistic. Not original because, well, these trolls have been around since I was a kid, some decades ago.Some of the scenes are very funny! There is adventure, comedy, cheekiness, music, funny villains, dancing, singing, farting, some tears, and what's not.The music is lovely and uplifting. Justin Timberlake has done at great job at selecting the music score and composing the main theme of the film. Both Timberlake and Kendrick are lovely in their respective roles.I watched this movie during one of those cry sessions where the cinema is full of kids. Most small children didn't get the jokes in the story, so I think that the movie is suited for 6y.o+ and adults. Most adults there had a ball and laughed as much or more as their kids.To be completely fair, this is one of those movies that you can grab in DVD or BR and watch it at home if you have a tight budget and need to prioritize what you see in the cinema."
" This movie made me happy
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,10,"No really, it did. I couldn't believe how nice this movie made me feel as I was watching it. The story is a pretty standard hero's journey, but with the evil trolls or grendels or whatever eating happy trolls to get happy themselves. It seemed a little dark at first, but everything works out in the end of course, as this is a kids movie. It shows good and bad in equal measure, which I believe is how we should educate kids, not keep them in a bubble. The lessons it teaches are actually nice, don't give up, persevere, happiness is within. The boy troll (Timberlake) is so funny, especially in the beginning. Anna Kendrick is hilarious with snappy dialogue. The songs are a bit old fashioned, the fact that the writer is nostalgic really stands out. But they fit the story, rather than being just music breaks, so it's good."
" My review of the movie Trolls.
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,4,"The story is so disjointed, especially in the beginning. Also, why is the black troll only happy once he turns another color? Hidden racism. I mean they break out in song that doesn't have anything to do with the story. Some of the songs don't even relate to the story. The story is way too predictable. Even my 5 year old granddaughter knew what was going to happen. It just was the feel good movie it poorly tried to be. The story also wasn't developed very well. I mean it just jumped right in there not giving the viewer any reason to like the. I just found them to be annoying. Take a tip from Pixar. Be original. Don't just pick a book or story and throw something together and expect audiences to like it. That's how that movie feels."
