" Lefty junk
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,1,"The usual lefty junk, used to justify mass immigration, while not dealing with the downsides, for the local population.A feel good movie for lefties, while ignoring the reality of their bizarre ideology."
" The one that fills your heart !!
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,7,"Movies are generally made for entertainment, there are only a handful movies that goes straight into your heart every year, The Good Lie is one such movie. The story follows the journey undertaken by a few kids in a strife ridden and civil war torn Sudan, Africa. The movie also focuses on the perils of their newly started lives in the United states of America. The Good Lie is a great eye opener for people living in developed countries on how difficult life is in general for people living in poorer countries, despite them reaching developed countries. It is also a gentle reminder for those who think reaching a developed country is an end to all ""their"" problems. The movie opens up all borders on the humanity front that is closed politically in the world that we live in today.Armed with a great screenplay the director has worked wonders on exploring the human touch in this high octane filled emotional drama, The Good Lie is beautifully edited in such a way that even a single scene in the movie remains totally focused on the story. Production design, Music, costumes and make up are decent for a tale of this nature. Acting levels are in fact very good for a majority of ""non-regular"" actors who are civil war survivors themselves, Reese Witherspoon delivers a neat and subtle performance that does some justice for her talent.Overall, The Good Lie is a ""Must"" watch movie for everyone along with their entire families to understand compassion, struggle, the joy of companionship, sacrifice, triumph, love and humanity. The movie will definitely fill our heart with goodness and touch our soul, its very hard not to get emotional after watching it. The Good Lie will also remind its viewers on how lucky they are to have the lives that they are living. Two Thumbs up for the effort and execution and a standing applause for its spirit."
" This is humble and subtle filmmaking and is a must watch.
",2020-09-29 00:00:00,7,"Reece Witherspoon's presence as an indomitable Kansas City charity worker may be its main selling point, but the heart of this fact-based drama is the long journey taken by a group of refugees from the Sudanese civil war."
" Almost best Christmas movie even...
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,9,"... if there was a slightly better casting :)

" A real must-watch. This is relity!
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,"This is one of my favourite movies ever. Wonderful (true) story, perfect directing, great cast, and awesome acting all around. It´s gritty and a complling watch."
" Disgusting movies with disgusting stereotypes!!!
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,10,"Honestly, I'm rarely bothered by Hollywood's negative and condescending portrayal of Africa, but for some reason this movie really offends me.The refugees didn't know what a phone was? Had encountered lions in Sudan??? These are harmful stereotypes, and rarely true. They are propagated to make Africans seem backward and somehow subhuman.Someone might say, well it's just a movie- however Africans are asked these kind of dumb questions every day, and it's appalling. I once asked a white colleague to google Accra (capital of Ghana) and she was shocked to see pictures of mansions, five star hotels etc comparable to anything you would find in any Western country.
Africa has a thriving middle class- professionals in diverse fields, who live very well, have 2 or 3 international holidays every year, yada yada. Yet the Western media and Hollywood are not interested in telling THAT story, because it doesn't fit into their narrative.This negative stereotyping agenda constantly being pushed by Western media and movies must stop. It encourages so much ignorance.
Africa is not a country, it's a continent. Every country in Africa has affluent people as well as people struggling. This is not unique to Africa, there are inequalities in every country in the world.To push such a negative narrative is very dangerous, especially in these racially- sensitive times.
Let us all educate ourselves, there is no need for such ignorance in this age."
" Good Film, but Forgettable
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,6,"A feel-good film based on a true story. Some timelines were condensed and half-assed, but I guess you need to make a film somehow.3/5. Some parts felt a bit slow but I did enjoy."
" The Good Tale
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,9,"The concept of a Good Lie is not new to me. It was called a White Lie, a lie told where no harm is done. Said mainly to save face. It was a common idea and I am surprised by the amount of commentators to whom this idea seems new.
This movie is very, very good. It is about a family of Sudanese refugees who eventually settle in the U.S. after their village was over run by rebels from the north. After 13 years as refugees they are resettled in Kansas to start a new life.
Their travails were not easy and this story is told with equal amounts of horror, humor, acceptance and grace that in no time at all the viewer is rooting for them.
Reese Witherspoon is awesome as usual and should be proud of her role.
This is a movie that should be shown in every classroom, especially in the mid west states to where a good portion of these refugees settle.
If this movie doesn't touch you, you need help."
" Heart touching
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,10,"The story is very heart warming as i have seen this movie in june 2019, and these days sudan is again under war and civilians are being killed there. I can feel their pain and fear through this movie"
" Not something to be proud
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,4,"Dear Americans,You guys hired Sudan's mainly for jobs and religious conversion.Itstechnically another form of slavery.Cant agree about the boasting this movie makes"
" The movie that everyone must watch
",2019-04-23 00:00:00,10,A strong movie that faces the inhuman reality of life
" A Great Story Told Well Enough
",2019-03-11 00:00:00,7,"The first hour drags down an otherwise solid movie. The film begins with a long title card and then spends 30 mins showing everything that the title card established. Even aside from the redundancy, this opening section was slow and the child actors were pretty bad.
Once it moves past that section though, the movie picks up and the fish out of water scenes are cute and fun. The cinematography and editing never gets very good, but the story and characters remain interesting enough and the performances are good enough for an entertaining experience. There's nothing groundbreaking here, but it's all competent enough to make for a pretty good way to spend ~2 hours."
" A heartstring-tugging drama with a lighthearted feel
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,6,"The Good Lie is a simple little movie that makes you appreciate all the things you have. The cast features real Sudanese refugees in addition to more seasoned actors, and everyone pulls their weight. Plus, even though this is a heartstring-tugging drama, it also manages to maintain a lighthearted feel."
" Good movie
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,10,It is a beautiful and nice movie and his history is very fantastic
" Nice story but cringy dialogue
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,5,"Great story up until when the the siblings win relocation to the United States..The it all goes sugar coated after the sister is separated from her brothers. Surely they would have known this before they came from Sudan. Then the dialogue goes mega cheesy. The ""Chicken Joke"", the Sudanese name for Reese Witherspoon character, in particular the doctor brother. All the African fish out of water stereotypes come out. The employment counselors (Reese Witherspoon/Corey Stoll) , the immigration people,their support officer (Sarah Baker) all bend over backwards to help these brothers. We know that doesn't happen. Its fantasy. The sister is relocated to live with Reese Witherspoon (not believable) Also one of the brothers smashes up a phone booth and gets arrested. Then nothing is mentioned about that. Then one of the brothers goes home (the doctor) and a different brother comes back on a forged passport. Ridiculous!"
" Soul Stirring, Engaging, Entertaining treat!
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,8,"'The good lie' is the name of the movie. It is far away from the reason or the topic what movie aims at delivering. The movie aims at portraying how relocation of 3600 orphaned children (called lost boys of Sudan) takes place after civil war broke in Sudan located in Africa.The movie is named so because of the story it highlights. A family is relocated to America along with what I call the second chief. After relocation they found out first chief is alive. The second chief travels back to Africa, lies in the documentation of first chief by giving his own documents and himself stays in Africa. It seems that the second chief can be of more help in Africa rather than America as he had worked as a medical assistant.Final Verdict: The story portrays something that is a winner. It is heartwarming, engaging and entertaining. It is worth adding to your collection."
" First movie to touch me so much that I was compelled to write a review.
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,10,"I'd never heard of this movie until it showed up on premium cable TV. I'm so glad it did, but wish it had gained the respect and popularity it so deserved. 
The young men and woman actors captured the despair, fear, and hopefulness of what the young refugees must have experienced perfectly. 
The one scene in this movie that touched my heart more than any in this, or any other movie, was the one where the orphans are settling into thier new home on the first night. It is just getting dark and you can see the worry on thier faces. I myself have been in a new place/situation many times in my own life. This scene reminded me vividly of what I'd almost forgotten. I remembered being in a new place, lying there as it was just getting dark, and feeling so afraid and longing for people and places I loved. No matter how happy one might be to be in a new place, that fear and longing are such a strong feeling.
I thought Reese, though a good actress overall, over-acted a bit in this film. Her dialog AND her delivery, were a bit too trite. Doesn't take away from the movie though. I highly recommend it to everyone."
" disappointing for anyone who has lived in Africa
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,2,"Just a heap of common places, clichés and overall unrealistic depiction of southern Sudanese people, Africans in general. I confidently watched the movie seeing all these good reviews but could not really even watch it all. I am unsure if anyone who has liked this has ever lived in Africa. and I can't believe people would believe African are so naive and aloof."
" The best touching movie I have seen
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,10,"One movie that was really good that may be the most underrated movie because it wasn't filled with with Hollywood drama and promotions was the movie ""The Good Lie"". Most African based type movies I have seen are always good. I love how this movie starts with a few guys born in Africa who try to advance together and try everything they can to get to America and live happily together. Especially about learning about their child hood in Africa they lost a friend who they thought was murdered long ago. I don't want to reiterate the entire movie, but I cried with the ending when they all found their friend they lost in Africa and the main character gave the friend his ticket so he could go to America with the others so he stayed in Africa where it turns out he would be happier in the first place as a doctor. All in all, I loved this movie absolutely 10 out of 10"
" Worse than the white Savior stereotype
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,1,"I must have been watching another film apart from everyone else because this is terrible. This film offers a ""feel good"" vibe meant to make us go, ""good for them!"". But in reality this war was brutal and went unattended for years by so many countries. Then you make a movie about the few who survived, never to see their home again. Feel good? They were brought to the U.S. and exploited, it is on screen for all to see! Also the freaking condescension is brutal to watch. ""This is ice, it is frozen water!"" Give me a break. This film is worse than the standard white Savior B.S. this is a self righteous, depressing, look what we did, pat yourselves on the back and shed a few tears B.S. But hey they made it to America, forget the millions of others who didn't even make it out of Sudan or the sorry state it is currently in now, and let us keep patting ourselves on the back."
