" The perfect soldier creates a hero out of a loser
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,8,"Her playlist was indeed good David. After they lost their soldier son, a friend of him from the army showed up at their house saying their son wanted him to tell them some stuff. It kept me guessing a long time what's off about him and it didn't turn out to be a cheesy thing. It was good to watch him beating the bully kids at the bar after school for the late soldier's nerd younger brother. He also stood up for the girl at the party and beat her ex and helped the father get a promotion by killing his superior. It was such a functional guy as he was designed to be the perfect soldier in a military lab and he managed to escape. He killed everyone that knew about him because he was designed to leave no trace of him behind. He killed the woman at the house when they busted the house. On his way away from the house he deliberately crashed the father's car and killed him too. He also killed the girl she helped and made love at the party and blew up the diner. Then the siblings with a military police ended up in a Halloween maze as the boy was grounded after standing up for himself and beating the bully who called him a slur. He came over and put on the cd at the DJ booth that the girl made for him and the kids survived because the boy managed to stab him with the knife he gave him as a gift. They were sitting at the back of a van outside with firemen and the girl saw him coming out disguised as a fireman. And they said one of the bodies inside didn't have his teeth. I'd love to watch a sequel to this as the anti-hero was flawless and really fun to watch."
" Good start but goes bad.
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,5,Movie started off great and Dan Stevens is great but when the feds get involved the plot goes nuts. Up to that point the story was believable but the feds response was unrealistic. It is too bad it had potential.

",2021-03-15 00:00:00,3,"Bad writing, bad acting, waste of 2 hours I can never get back."
" A slow-burn creep thriller that boils over into psychotic, action-packed mayhem.
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,8,"Everyone else pretty much covers all the high points so I won't take up your time with a long study on everything cool about this movie.I was having a grumpy day, a bad day. Plopped down in my chair, turned Netflix on and literally just hot play on the first thing they recommended. I didn't give a flying f--- I just wanted t take my mind off the day.Holy hell. Military conspiracies, dbag high school bullies, super-soldier experimentation, beer, drugs, grenades. Oh, and Prom Night on Halloween. All set to some radical 80's chillwave synth. Good Times!While not a AAA title by any means, it is a top-notch B grade thriller that does everything right.
So if you're looking for something to kill 90 minutes, but still want something engaging and interesting with solid acting, great direction and story, you can't go wrong with The Guest."
" Not horrible, but not very good either.
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,5,"The story goes absolutely nowhere. So you are watching this mysterious guy, but there are never any real answers."
" terrible
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,1,I made an account just to rate how bad this movie was. The good reviews made me watch it but it's a huge waste of time trust me
" What is this ??
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,2,Really bad movie on every aspect. I don't understand how this movie got so many good reviews. I honestly think they must be fake ...
" The Guest
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,7,"I remember hearing about this film when the leading actor was interviewed by Susanna Reid on Good Morning Britain and asked if he had to ""beat off"" loads of American actors to get the part lol, it was rated well and sounded good, directed by Adam Wingard (You're Next, Blair Witch). Basically, Spencer (Leland Orser) and Laura Peterson (Sheila Kelley), with their children Luke (Brendan Meyer) and Anna (Maika Monroe), are coping with the death of their eldest son, Caleb (Chris Harding), killed in the war in Afghanistan. They are visited by former army sergeant David Collins (Dan Stevens) who claims he was Caleb's best friend and appears in a photo alongside him and his troop. He tells the family he wanted to visit them to help Caleb take care of them. David is polite and friendly, and Laura invites him to stay for as long as he wants. David hears of Spencer's troubles at work, and he sees Luke return home with a bruise on his face, caused by bullies at school. The next day, David and Luke follow the bullies to a bar. David assaults all of them and uses his knowledge of the law, and a bribe, to stop the bartender from telling anyone. David goes to a party with a reluctant Anna, where he makes a good impression with her friends. He saves her friend Kristen (Tabatha Shaun) from her violent ex-boyfriend, and they have sex. David asks Anna's friend Craig (Joel David Moore) where he can buy a gun. On their way home, Anna offers to make David a mix CD. David gives Luke advice on dealing with bullies and gives him his butterfly knife. He meets Craig and his friend to buy the gun but kills them and steals their weapons. Anna becomes suspicious of David and calls the military to ask about him. She is told that David Collins died a week earlier. The call alerts a private corporation called the KPG, headed by Major Carver (John Wick's Lance Reddick), who assembles a special forces team and heads for Peterson's home. Anna then learns about Craig's death, which her boyfriend Zeke (Chase Williamson) has been blamed for, and that Spencer's boss died in mysterious circumstances, leading to Spencer's promotion. Anna takes David's phone to take a picture of previous numbers he called, asking Luke to research them. Luke is confronted by the bullies at school again, but he fights back. Luke is taken to the principal's office, Laura and David arrive and the principal may have no choice but to expel Luke. But David coerces the principal into believing it was a ""hate crime"" against Luke, for being homosexual, and threatens litigation against the school, unless Luke is instead given after-school detention for a month. Following this, Luke talks to David and mentions Anna's suspicions of him but promises not to investigate any further or tell anyone else. While David helps Laura with the laundry, Major Carver's team arrive and attack the house. David kills all the squad except for Carver. Realising his cover has been blown, David kills Laura. He drives away and kills Spencer who was on the way home. Carver picks up Anna and informs her that her parents are dead. He reveals that David was a test subject in a military medical experiment and was ""programmed"" to kill anyone who might compromise his identity and will not stop. Meanwhile, David kills Kristen and pulls a grenade to blow up the restaurant where she works. He goes to the school to kill Luke. Carver and Anna arrive there before David, and enter a haunted house set up for the Halloween dance. David turns off the lights and plays Anna's mix CD, then kills Luke's teacher and Carver. Anna shoots David with Carver's gun, but David stabs her in the leg and attempts to choke her, while the gunfire damages a light and ignites a fire. Luke stabs David with the butterfly knife, and Anna is freed. David tells Luke that he did the right thing and gives him a thumbs-up before collapsing. Anna and Luke rest in the ambulance as the firefighters arrive. They overhear that only two bodies were found, and Anna is shocked to see one of the firefighters limping, it is David in disguise who escaped. Also starring Ethan Embry as Higgins, Jesse Luken as Drew, and Candice Patton as Sergeant Halway. Stevens, best known previously for starring in Downton Abbey, proves a terrific choice as the antihero who appears to be a charming ""guest"" but is a sinister stranger. The first half is a questionable but interesting series of moments where the lead character shows his violent and manipulative side, and the second half goes all out with guns blazing and explosions, it is written relatively well and is a good throwback to 80s style B-movies, a watchable thriller. Very good!"
" ""Never let anyone pick on you.""
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,6,"There have been some pretty egregious cases of stolen valor reported over the past few years, but this fictional one goes way beyond bizarre. The explanation offered by Major Carver (Lance Reddick) for David Anderson Collins as a military experiment gone wrong was too simplistic to get away with, but it seems like the screenwriters went with it anyway. But I did like the way Dan Stevens portrayed his character, especially the smooth way he ingratiated himself with the Peterson family and some of the townies. But boy, plot holes and a lack of common sense occur way too often to make this a credible story. Like when Carver's assault team opened fire on the Peterson house without knowing if anyone else was in there. Really? And then, when David makes his break after killing everyone but the Major, how is it Carver arrived so far behind the crash scene that killed Spenser Peterson (Leland Orser), when he took off with David still in sight? Another Carver goof occurred when he yelled to Anna (Maika Monroe) and Luke (Brendan Meyer) to run away in the Halloween spook house; nothing like letting your enemy know exactly where you are when it's a matter of life or death. Predictably, the ending is telegraphed way back when David offered Luke his military knife, giving the younger brother a chance to make the save right before the cops arrived. But wait a minute, or did he? We're supposed to believe that after getting shot and stabbed big time in the middle of his chest, David makes his exit disguised as a fireman? As Joe Biden would be so apt to say, ""Come on, Man!"""
" Candy Coloured Psycho Thriller
",2021-03-04 00:00:00,9,"Adam Wingard's 'The Guest' is a sleek, intelligent and thrilling candy-coloured art-house psychological thriller that boasts a psychotically charming performance from blue-eyed brit Dan Stevens and an intelligent script packed with original twists and ample thrills.A grieving family inivite a seemingly innocent, well-mannered, charming guest that claims to be a close friend of their recently departed loved one, into their home. As soon as you lock eyes with David you succumb to his undeniable charm, you believe he has good intentions without caring for any explanation, just like the Peterson's.There's a quiet but deadly swagger about him; suave, mysterious, calm, charming, yet an extremely dark aura permeates from his presence. You know something is amiss, but you're so entranced by David's persona you fail to acknowledge or accept there is something incredibly dark and mysterious about him, that is until it's too late.Dan Steven's is extraordinarily talented and criminally under-appreciated. He can switch from quiet, polite and charming to darn right psychotic and intimidating in a split-second without ever feeling anything but authentic. He demands your presence, drawing you into every scene with his telling eyes and mysterious demeanour.Director Adam Wingard's 'The Guest' is a homage to genre cinema. He calls back to classic thrillers of past in order to reinvent the genre with something fresh, thrilling and wickedly fun. Every collective aspect, from the intense synth score Cliff Martinez would be proud of, to the taut tonal shifts, the cutting dark humour, the Tarantino-esque violence and the intelligent screenplay combines in harmonious fashion, creating a film with a perfect fluency.Check out my IG @MovieFestUK"
" Loved it, re watch material
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,8,"Wow this was so good and I did not expect it to be. Love the retro soundtrack and all the performances were spot on. One of those movies where you route for the bad guy, for sure."
" Loved it
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,8,"My only issue with this movie is that I wish it was a little bit longer and had extra scenes within the movie. It feels like it's missing extra scenes. Apart from that: great acting, story, directing, soundtrack, and atmosphere. The atmosphere is just perfect and the pace as well. There is a lot of mystery here and it unfolds beautifully. Dan Stevens acted his ass off as usual and the rest of the cast fit right in. There should be a sequel but Hollywood just loves giving us more of the remakes and cheap stories."
" Don't understand the hype
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,3,"Don't get the hype on this one unfortunately.
An alright premise let down by less than average acting and poor writing.
The last 10 or 15 minutes aren't bad, but it's not worth sitting through the whole film for it."
" Loved it!
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,10,"Dan Stephens was brilliant, the way in which he switches from charm to menacing in a moment and his American accent make this worth watching for this alone. I had not rated him as a great actor but will now look for other movies with him in it. One to watch as you really can't quite make up your mind as to what you think of him until towards the end!"
" Garbage
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,1,"Many movies require a suspension of disbelief, but this requires one to have no brain whatsoever.
I think it's safe to say by now that most good reviews on this site are from cast and production staff of the movies themselves.
I refuse to believe anyone with intelligence and integrity would say this movie is anything but the utter trash that it is.
I could go into a long list of all that is bad in this diabolical waste of celluloid but I really feel that time has already been stolen from me.
Avoid."
" Ratings can be deceiving, this movie is an perfect example of that
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,3,"The main character who is Everyone's best friend is all of sudden turns put to be a badass wanted criminal by the Army the plot literally doesn't make sense, other half of the movie suscks, don't waste your time on it."
" Mysterious, thrilling, captivating and a BOMB soundtrack to boot!
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,10,"I loved so much about this film. It's probably closer to a 9.5, but I couldn't lower it to a 9.
It is shot so well. The colors are fantastic and used very stylishly with the music and other effects (like light and smoke.) This film is visually very pleasing.
The story is very intriguing, and kept me wondering throughout exactly who ""had it right"" in the story. Every turn was so satisfying, and your like for each character grows throughout the whole film. The acting is very well done.
The film pulls at your heart strings a couple of times in a very compelling way, not cheesy at all.
Finally, the action is great. Good fight scenes throughout.
In terms of the ending, simply perfect. Makes you crave an immediate sequel!!
I just loved everything about this film!"
" Unexpectedly Good
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,8,"I liked Dan Stevens in Downton Abbey, but hadn't seen him in anything else since. This title kept popping up and I decided to watch. Definitely a departure from Matthew Crawley character and a fresh peek at his acting talents. I was pulled in by David, like the family did. Even though I know more is supposed to happen (the trailer), but the family didn't and I felt like one of them even after watching the trailer. David is an amalgamation of past troubled soul come hero types (Rambo) mixed with some serious psychosis. Give it a whirl. Had room for development though I was satisfied with the end a la our favorite 80s and early 90s fair."
" A fun watch
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,6,"Although it was an entertaining movie, stuff didn't add up and the ending was kind of stupid. 6/10 ."
" Fun, intense and entertaining
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,9,"Dang, that was good. Really wasn't expecting to enjoy this as much as i did, but i literally couldn't take my eyes off the screen (Could be because Dan Stevens is freaking PERFECTION here). Not one dull moment, it's intriguing from the start, up to the last second. The build up of tension is so good and than boom, all hell breaks lose for the finale arc. What a ride. Why i didn't watch this soon is a mystery, but i'm so glad i finally did."
" Some 80s synths and a handful of funny moments
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,2,I see what they were going for with this but it's not any where near as clever or funny as the critics and reviews say it is. Planet Terror did this kind of thing way better as it was rammed full of references and the cinematography and styling was spot on. This is just incredibly amateur and basic and needed so many more hammy moments to elevate it.
" Insult for the mind
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,3,"Anyone who consider themself a cinema lover can't stand watching, especially the second half. As the things get ""wild"", movie starts to fall on itself. Total waste of time though it doesnt look like so at the beginning."
" Totally rambling script to show a lot of over the top violence
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,1,"We know these movies of the nice stranger corrupting a family. From the beginning it seemed this was not the best of them. The nice friend this time is a monster of Frankenstein, a programmed ideal fighting machine. At least the original Frankenstein monster was somehow sympathetic. This is just was he is a poor construct of a script writer. And then the music at the end, sort of light uplifting music making the end into a musical of violence. And the military police, so absolutely ridiculous unbelievable. Yes a waste of time and so Americain to put up another 90 minutes of violence. They love it."
" But what really happened to their son?
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,6,"It's great movie.Main actor did great job.I love the ending.There are still questions left.David told to his friend?'s mother like..your son had human subject?
But this guy became violent and experiememt was failed.Then their son is died because of failed by army??
They didn't explain about the most important part.But you can imagine whatever you like.
This movie had dull scene but still great movie.This guy is british?Nowadays most of hollywood movies's main roll are not american.They got really amazing american accent.Most of the time i believe they are probably american actors/actress..Then actually no.Bit ironic,isn't it?haha"
" "" I Was Not "" . . .
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,2,My take is different . .I'm generally easily pleased and I was not.This 'Guest' will not be invited to any of my future parties.This is because I like to be entertained in an enjoyable and believable way.
" Strange ...
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,5,"Yea... im not sure what to say.. the movie started out good - mysterious quality, Dan Stevens is gorgeous and plays the part well, calm and collected, but you know he's probably actually a bit of a psycho and is hiding something major.. but it seems like he cared about Caleb and really is trying to look out for his family even tho he's obviously on the run for something .. about halfway through you start to question the sense of it all, and then it literally turns into a nonsensical 80's slasher film where there's not even any point in any of it and the acting and entire plot turns into a campy mess... very odd. The ending is totally unrealistic too. Soundtrack is weird.. yea i don't know lol. Very disappointed after about halfway on. I'd say starting halfway through or maybe almost 3/4 of the way through, this could've been such a much better film, if they at least could have kept him continuing to protect the family and not try to kill them all, like maybe truly formed a bond with them even despite the fact that Anna was trying to turn him in. I mean I understand that he was part of an experiment that altered his brain but, he protected them the whole time and then just kills them lol. Would've been better if he was able to breakthrough and truly at least just care about them, and then had the family protect him once the military came for him and like hid him and helped him escape. Could've had more substance but it just went in a different direction. Disappointing to say the least. Not what I was expecting. Expected more of a psychological thriller but got a campy slasher film."
" All is well - excpet the ending
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,7,"Well, till 70-75 mins out of 100 - this movie holds your nerves...till then, i was thinking the imdb avg rating should be 8+. But at the last 30 mins it proved me wrong. Another example where it almost failed - even after going in quiet promisingly.Being said that, this is worth watching; but don't keep much expectations. Also there are mutiple notable flaws can be found in the movie. Like why the military special force will come with only 6 shooters OR why Caleb's sister doesn't call 911/discuss the matter seriously when she found something mysterious on David! Ignore them...The story develops when an unwanted guest joins Peterson family and things keeps on happening. Acting wise everyone does it quiet well. & JUST Loved Dan stevens as David, his acting probably suppresses most of all the other messes created by the script. Soundtracks are nice too.Recommend: Yes."
" A Hot Mess...but Kinda Enjoyable...Just
",2020-12-15 00:00:00,6,"This thing starts off OK with, David, a soldier cozying up to a family who lost their son in battle. David is intent in making this family's life better...in the most violent ways. Where it all goes wrong is when it's introduced that David is some escaped super soldier. Then the movie throws logic out the window and it turns into an 80's B-horror flick. There's lots of things that don't work from story details to character inconsistencies to unnecessary body count. It's worth watching for Dan Stevens' performance and the music score, but it's a hot mess from top to bottom."
" Suspense thriller
",2020-11-24 00:00:00,8,"At the initial stages the movie feels like a feel good movie that might have a conventional ending. However as the plot thickens it triggers a sense of curiosity as to what might be the next scene. While keeping it entertaining throughout the movie it ends with an unconventional twist in the story. Overall it is worth watching if you have palate for suspense thriller.
Note: You would be disappointed if you only like happy endings. ."
" I absolutely love this movie
",2020-11-22 00:00:00,10,This is a movie I didn't know about but I was missing out on a great movie
" A wonderful TV movie
",2020-11-12 00:00:00,8,"I remember liking this movie when I watched it 5 years ago. It looked like a TV movie but the story was very appealing, acting well done, and directing superb. I liked it a lot, and I downloaded the soundtrack which was ""stylish"" (a word used multiple times to describe this movie by other reviewers).This movie (or this adapted short story) is really a study about psychopaths. Forget about the negative affiliations our culture has put out about psychopaths, they have been a very important step in human evolution. The Yakuza in Japan, psychopaths. The Italian mob, psychopaths. Most fortune 500 CEOs, psychopaths. The Pawnee warriors, psychopaths. Some US soldier deployed to wars in 2014, psychopaths. Most politicians, you guessed it, psychopaths.There has been an evolutionary need for someone who can switch their feelings off in order to protect their loved ones. Do you ever wonder why your lovely friendly German Shepherd can be so nice to you, but will rip the face of your enemy? This is what psychopaths do. They have a mission, to protect their loved ones. Be sure to know who they are and be on their side."
" A Decent Thriller
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,7,"A really decent thriller, sometimes you expect these B-movies to be poor, but The Guest has many good qualities. Most importantly, it is a thriller, and the climax certainly has you on edge. Stevens plays his part well, and although it may be a cliché character, at least it's executed properly. Mostly though, the music interweaved into the story really creates the best atmosphere throughout, and improves the overall watch substantially.However, the plot is somewhat unoriginal, with clichés frequent. There are big gaps which would connect all elements of the film to help it make perfect sense. Plus, a times you just wonder how daft people can be, and whether in real life people would actually go along with half of this stuff?"
" Hello 2014, the 80s called
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,5,"Ok, this actually was a decent movie until near the end. However, was it a SPOOF? The music and some of the hairstyle and things were SO set in the 80s. If this movie wasn't a spoof, then the music for the movie was INCREDIBLY dated and the ending made you think you were watching something like ""Carrie"" or ""Fright Night"" from the 80s. Had the soundtrack been updated and the ending been not so cheesy, it could've been a better-rated contemporary movie."
" It's amazing that this has an average of 6.7 out of 10.
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,1,What a pile of garbage this movie was. Plot makes no sense and the character development was so thin. Top that off with mediocre at best acting and you have The Guest. This is 90 minutes I will never get back. The fact that it's scored almost a seven out of ten blows my mind. I've seen better work at a middle school play.
" Pretty shocked by the good reviews, by all means - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME
",2020-10-18 00:00:00,2,"Poorly written script, mediocre actors (except of the two kids), AWFULLY BAD SOUNTRACK although I really like 80s, and by you're half into it you know you're doomed with a movie that is actually a really bad B-Movie. Don't, just Dont"
" A Stylish, But Rather Vapid Thriller
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,6,"Pros:
1. The combat is greatly choreographed, hard-hitting and exhilirating to watch.
2. The pounding bass soundtrack does a good job at heightening the tension and suspense.
3. Dan Stevens (""David"") gives a fantastic performance.
4. The comedy is subtle and, when it lands, produces some hilarious moments.
5. The violence and gore is brutal and unforgiving, especially when Laura Peterson (Sheila Kelley) dies.
6. The pacing, considering the minimum substance, is incredibly succinct and well-done.
7. The entire last fight scene in the haunted house high school setting is beautifully shot, entrancingly intense, and just enjoyable to watch.Cons:
1. ""David"", who comes from a military background, is conveniently reckless in answering a secret call right outside the Peterson household, which ends up being the beginning of the end for him.
2. Somehow ""David"" survives, and it just feels like a cheap way to pave the path for a sequel.
3. The tone is a little confusing at times as the movie doesn't seem to know when to introduce the comedy, and when to play it serious.
4. The characters of Laura Peterson, Spencer Peterson, and Luke Peterson (Brendan Meyer) are heavily underdeveloped."
" More movies should be like this!
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,8,"An 80's inspired thriller horror comedy about an ex-navy seal who shows up to a family's home and claims he was enlisted with their dead son in the same unit. The family is charmed by him and he is allowed to live with them. He fills the void of the dead brother by looking after the little brother and sister and helping the father and mother - unfortunately what he does to help them is commit murder and other crimes. The girl catches wind that he is up to no good and call the military to report him - and that is when the fun starts. The Guest is funny, smart, self-aware, violent, and heartfelt."
" Awful
",2020-09-20 00:00:00,2,"Awful movie. terrible acting, ridiculous and boring"
" Did we all watch the same movie???
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,2,I'm not sure if this movie is supposed to be serious or not. The acting could not be stiffer and contrived. My husband and I were lol'ing at the end because WOW. Just wow.
" Satisfying thriller
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,9,"Dan Stevens is so cool especially in this and so is the music! Starts off a little awkward but when it picks up it'll make you smile at least I do. Adam Wingard is very good at his craft, I very much enjoy his films! I love how menacing some scenes turn out to be unexpectedly. I wanted to buy it years ago I still should Netflix is great though."
" It's not Mathew from Downtown Abbey
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,5,(this review contains spoilers) An interesting low budget thriller. I was not sure if it was lifetime movie or not. Kind of reminds me of an ABC movie of the week. Dan Stevens does a great job acting like a complicated person the looks he gives and give anyone the chills. One thing I liked about it was not predictable. In the scene where the military contractors show up one would think like most hero movies he saves the family he is living with who considers him a true friend not here. He takes them out.All in all a good effort
" Engrossing and Surprising
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,9,"Tension builds up throughout. Characters are well developed. Some shocking moments. With a couple of exceptions, very realistic. The lead character carries the film, but the supporting actors were very strong as well."
" An interesting Guest
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,9,"The Guest (2014) starring Dan Stevens. Suddenly when David (Dan Stevens) turns up at the Peterson household, he makes a show of expecting nothing more than to pay his respects over their son Caleb, who died while they were fighting together in Iraq. Caleb's grieving mother (Sheila Kelley) is happy to learn more about what happened to her boy, and insists David he stay for a night or two, rejecting his worry that he'd be an imposition. The father (Leland Orser) accepts David, too, grateful to have a drinking buddy to justify his hard turn to the bottle, and his teenage son Luke (Brendan Meyer) benefits from having a big-brother type to protect him from bullies. Only Luke's older sister, Anna (Maika Monroe), seems hostile but eventually she comes around."
" 7.5/10 Loved it but.....
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,8,"I did like mainly as the lead guy is gorgeous and you want chemistry to go further between him and the girl.. but major plot holes if he really was trying to stay off the radar than rather than going around killing people mainly the guys he was suppose to just pay cash for a few guns for then he wouldnt have aroused a load of suspicion about himself prompting the daughter to check up on him. Another point that didnt make sense was to kill the mum & dad after theyd been nice to him. The secret agents already knew he was their he wasnt disposing if evidence he was creating it. Same with going after the young son & daughter in real life pointless when he would need to be escaping the town not hanging around it.. wish we couldve got a bit more out of the end too with him and the daughters fight him torn whether to kill her or feelings stopping him wouldve been better. The son stepping up was right on .. his dying scene a little cheesy.. I still all in all loved the film. Liked the soundtrack characters
He was suave, mesmerising and good as a skilled soldier killer
I will probably watch this again. I like these sort of desert countryside killer movies
Also great soundtrack. The music choice and cinematography as the daughter comes up behind him and says you killed my parents is beautiful!!! Very retro style so 80s. I've watched this film about 3 times in 24hours so definitely entertained. Sad it only made half of its budget back I put this down to not the film being bad but it not being publicized enough for release ive only just heard of it in the comment section on imdb which maybe decide to watch of it wasnt for that comment never woildve known about it. Shame. Think one day this will become a cult classic like other films that didn't do so well such as bad batch etc"
" A+ till end
",2020-08-15 00:00:00,7,This was an A+ movie until the end when it got all 1980s Jason Freddy Krueger like with the crazy music and unrealistic that one of the military place is following him. Expecting a bigger finish at the end for the amount of damage this guy did. But the beginning was very very good
" So great that I'm Still waiting for a sequel
",2020-08-13 00:00:00,9,"I love this film, it's one of the best and original thrillers of the last decade."
" Is this a comedy?
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,3,Because I laughed so hard at how bad it was. Icing on the cake was Major Carver's girlish scream complete with O face. And to think that was the take they deemed good enough for the final cut.
" MYSTERIOUS.
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,7,"It's predictable, sure, but also mysterious. Dan Stevens shines as the almost machine-like antagonist. Terrific. Plot is lively, simple and fast pace. Ending is a little surprising. Worth checking out."
" Truly epic thriller
",2020-07-28 00:00:00,9,"Love this film, you never really know quite where it is going, starts out as one thing and ends as another. The film goes beyond your expectations in terms of its structure.Dan Stevens should really get much more work based on the solidity of his performance here, even though he's the basd guy he isa likeable to the last minute.The film is topped off by one of the best scores i've ever heard, a truely rocking score that highlights its 80s influences.I saw this for the first time in 2014, i've seen it a dozen times since then, i never lose the passion for this."
" Which film did these reviewers watch?
",2020-07-25 00:00:00,3,"There is no way on earth that the people giving high marks to The Guest actually watched it. What a stupid, stupid movie! I certainly hope the Military Police in the real world are smarter than two teenagers. Ugh!"
" stylish retro horror/thriller
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,8,"I gave it only 8 for two things. The first is the electronic soundtrack. I get that it's because the movie is retro, but damn, the last time electronic music in a movie sounded good was in Terminator. Ever after, it's pretty much a bad idea.The second is that it is maybe a little too much of an homage to fun horror/thriller movies - too retro. It has echoes of old slasher movies like Hallowe'en, Carrie, Nightmare on Elm Street, and that's fun, but it's kind of soulless. It had a pretty good momentum building, on its own merits, without having to resort to winking at the past. In my view, it kind of diminishes what had been accomplished otherwise in the film. It became quite a bit less interesting, where potential was promised but not fully developed.That said, it is fun, it's fast, Dan Stevens is a great as usual. I'm getting the feeling that he is fairly particular in the projects that he chooses. It's a good thing :) It shows! If he's in a movie, it's going to be worth watching.I'd also like to add that I really don't think there's any subtext about how the military treats its soldiers, etc. It's a plot device, almost a kind of shorthand back story, that everyone knows and therefore needn't be explained."
" good not great
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,6,"Laura Peterson is home alone when a stranger shows up at her door. He claims to be David Collins (Dan Stevens), an Army friend of her late son Caleb who died in Afghanistan. She invites him into her home. Soon, his outrageous ways start influencing the various family members.I really like Dan Stevens as the crazy guest in a psychological thriller. The incident with the football team at the bar is perfect. I'm rolling with a slow descend into a dysfunctional family chaos. Instead, the movie adds an outside military story. I am less impressed with turning this into a shoot them up. By doing that, David's interesting psychological disturbance becomes an experiment gone wrong. In some ways, it's less scary. This is good but it could have been great."
" Great thrilling movie
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,9,Great suspense movie. Movie builds suspense from the beginning. Viewer trying to figure out the main character that what he is about and what he wants. And then slowly movie gets fast and action is also tasteful.
" A fun time
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,8,"This is really good for a B movie and is a ton of fun.Don't expect high budget writing, but its honestly a blast."
" Great way to throwback to old school horror!
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,8,"So this movie is about a mysterious ex-soldier showing up to this family's house and claiming to know there recently deceased son. You can see the family is still grieving and welcome him in to stay with them for a few days till he figures some things out, but soon the kids start to suspect something may be off. Dan Stevens gives a great performance and from the minute he is on the screen you get more and more curious about his character. Straightforward plot and easy to digest. Plus it had awesome/violent action mixed in with the horror. I loved the 80s style soundtrack and stylish directing. I really recommend checking this one out!
My actual rating is a 8.2/10"
" Ripped off by NF again!
",2020-07-14 00:00:00,1,"The movie started off slow, but gradually got interesting and mysterious, with minimal explanation as to the identity and purpose of this stranger, coming to an exciting actionful/chase thriller in the last 20 minutes or so. Only to be let down by a poor explanation and cop out ending! Don't bother with this one."
" Great hidden gem!
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,10,This is a great movie! Keeps you tense amd the twists and turns are great..and the acting was incredible. I was very impressed
" I do love oldskool movies
",2020-07-08 00:00:00,5,"And I had high hopes for this one, but I have mixed feelings. Or I am just too old anymore for this teenager craps 😅 The best word is awkward for this movie I think. First of all; there's nothing wrong with the acting. I'm delighted to see Dan's toned body, get it back, you are too skinny at the moment!😄
If you wanna make an 80s movie, make an 80s movie, but in the 80s. It's a common problem these days. Everyone wants an 80s Movie that takes place in the 2000s. Not going to work.
I loved the music, but made it just more awkward. I don't really know how express myself. Probably bc this movie is very messy. Shame,shame,shame."
" Alright but I would not recommend
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,4,Very corny and low quality. The plot was okay. If you like 80s nostalgia then this might be a movie for you. Personally I would just watch an 80s thriller instead.
" HORRIBLE
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,1,"The worst movie I've ever seen.
Don't waste your time."
" Not for everyone
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,1,If you're like 70 years old and like to watch a 60s 70s movie remade then this movie is for you otherwise this movie sucks ass. But I guess the film makers were going for this wierd corny thriller. A lot of positive reviews led me to watch but man was I disappointed. I was waiting for the story to pick up but it did not. I would def not recommend this movie.
" Garbage GARBAGE acting and everything else
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,1,Giant waste of time. Stevens should have stuck with Downton Abbey. Acting was horrendous and the plot is predictable and boring. The only thing I can assume is it has high ratings because people invested in the film got a bunch of friends to rate it.
" Baffled
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,1,"I've no words for the good reviews. Silly movie, poorly acted."
" So fun
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,9,"Ok so we have Dan stevens, the girl from it follows, and the kid from fear the walking dead, the one that survived the plane in a great fun movie. I watched this movie once when it first came out. It's June 24th 2020 now and I found it on Netflix. And I didn't remember a single thing. It's pure genius. It's like watching an 80's film. Not for everyone. Which is ok. But don't down people and say they have no taste. I'm sure there's movies you have seen that I don't like. Or others don't like. But if you havnt watched this movie. Give it a try. Has an awesome soundtrack as well. Also I see alot of people saying it's predictable.....which obviously the synopsis pretty much tells you what's gonna happen....for the most part.....but bravo for being able to read and booooo for feeling like your predicted the movie on your own. Just enjoy something instead of taking it so dang serious. Your negative reviews bore the people that love this movie. Anything below a 7 digging the movie got a thumbs down from me. P.s. I'm real not a bot paid to do this. If I was I'd be filthy rich 😂"
" UNTHINKABLE, FANTASTIC
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,10,"This film, The Guest, is a well written and directed script. It is not a low-budget film, the setting, and the plot a prefect. Don't believe that you can figure this one out, you're going to have to keep your head on a swivel and be open-minded. The fighting choreography is like one from a Bruce Lee film. Undoubtedly, a must-watch, and I promise you it will leave you saying, ""Well, I didn't see that one coming""."
" Oh boy...this isn't good!
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,1,"I watched this movie because I watched a youtube video of hidden gems on Netflix then saw the high ratings! How it got those ratings I have no clue! There are so many plot holes in this movie! The movie starts with a lot of potential then just completely falls apart. My review will contsin spoilers, so if you are planning to watch it, this would be a good time to stop reading.The acting in this movie is B material with a couple recognizable faces probably added to give some credibility to the movie. The plot is the whole stranger shows up and is not the good guy people think he is. One of the biggest problems I had with this movie is the characters action made no sense and wouldn't be how someone would reasonably act! For instance, David (the titles guest) shows up at the door of the Peterson's home where Laura (mama Peterson) answers and lets him in. We find out he served in the military with Laura's son and was with him when he was killed in action. So what does mama do? She invites him to stay the night in her dead sons room which, by the looks of it, never changed after her son left for the military! Really? The Leland (dad) comes home and initially has a problem with him there but has a beer and he is ok with it. Keep in mind that this is a good looking man he doesn't know and Dad is comepletely fine with it despite having a 20 yr old daughter (Anna) living there and of course his wife. Ya...not happening, yet it did! As the movie progresses we get to see David isn't who everyone thinks he is. After initially helping out the family, he helps Luke (the son) with his bullies David decides he needs to buy a gun. We get to watch a scene where he meets a gun dealer, decides he wants all the dealers weapons. Instead of buying them (the movie hints that this guy has alot of cash) he kills the dealer and his friend for no apparent reason. Why? Niether of these guys knew anything about his ""secret"" and he had the cash to buy them all. Why murder them and draw unwanted police attention. In another part of the movie we find out he murdered Dad's boss and his bosses wife to help Dad het a promotion. Of course he made it look like a suicide so nobody is the wiser. Anna decides somethings up with David so she does some snooping and finds out David died in a fire some time back! She then asks her brother (Luke) to do some internet detective work. Then we get a scene where Luke confronts David in a scene that makes no sense at all! He tells David that he knows he killed his the gun dealers and his dads boss and wife. He also knows he isn't who he says he is. Then tells him he is completely fine with it and his secret is safe with him. Keep in mind he just told him his sister asked him to snoop around and she thinks David is a murderer! Nice brother you got there Anna!A secret government group then visits Mom. She is outside the house hanging laundry and David helps but heads back to the house just as a two big black SUVs arrive. Major Carver questions Mom then David reapears and proceeds to start shooting at the HEAVILY armed men picking them off as he goes. He runs back into the house as Mom stands around in shock. The government guys begin to completely unload there (i think they are AK's, im not good at recognizing firearms) AK-47s on the house, hundreds of rounds are raining down on the house. What does Mom do? Run? Take cover behind one of the SUV's? Nope...she runs into the house the that is being turned into swiss cheese...really! She is eventually killed by Davis who is apparently wearing a bullet deterent because no rounds hit him, except for one that buzzed his leg. David is also a great shot, he hits everything he shoots. Also, the heavily armed government guys aren't wearing any protective gear, no body armour...ya, that makes sense! Eventually David makes it to a vehicle and thats when we get an absolutly ridiculous editing job. As he drives away from the house, David shoots the tires out on both SUVs, you see the tires hit and that side of the vehicle quickly lowes to the ground making them undrivable! Not 5 seconds later we see the Major hop into one of the SUVs, which now appears to have 4 completely intact tires. A shot from above as he is pulling away shows that both of the SUVs tires was untouched! What? The Major gives chase and isn't very far behind, David has about a 5 second lead. The we get a cut where we see Dad on the long dirt road driving home. David is coming the opposite direction. Instead of tring to drive past Dad, David decides to hit him head on. What? The Major is on his tale, why do this. He gets out of the vehicle completely unscathed then walks over to Dad as shoots him! All i could think of during this scene was ""where is the Major? He was right behind him and now he is nowhere to be seen"". David then goes to the resturaunt where Anna and her friend (who he boned earlier) work. He asks her friend where Anna is and she says she doesn't know. He then shoots and kills her in the middle of the resturaunt in front of the other customers and walks out. As he is leaving he takes out two gernades and tosses them on the floor blowing up the entire building. Why shoot the girl if you were gonna just blow the building up anyway? Ya...that makes sense.The final scene is at Lukes high schools haunted house where he is working off a punishment. All our characters arrive. David kills the teacher watching Luke, then he kills the Major. David chases Anna and Luke around the maze. Anna and Luke decide to split up. Eventually Anna gets the drop on David when she finds the Majors gun. With a fog machine going Anna shoots David in the shoulder, he falls down and is covered by the fog. When Anna walks to where he dropped, the fog (which is about knee high) parts and David is gone. He then attacks her and pushes her to the ground, how she didn't see him get up and move is beyond me because he was directly in front of her. As he is trying to strangle Anna on the ground Luke stabs him in the back with a knife David gave him earlier. After getting stabbed in the back, he stands up and Luke stabs him in the chest leaving the knife inside him. He falls and ""dies""! Problem solved! Cut to EMTs taking care of the two of them. Firemen, Detectives, Police and EMTs are all over the scene. We hear a fireman tell the detective there were two bodies inside and one had his teeth broken out. Hmmm....there should be 3 bodies! We then see firemen exit the building and one has a limp! Guess who it is...its David in a firemen suit! So where did that guys body go? David must be super human! He gets shot in the leg, gets in a high speed head on collision, shot in the shoulder, and stabbed in the back and chest. Yet only has a limp! During the course of things we find out David is part of some secret experiment but no details are given. I was gonna give it the benefit of the doubt and assume this experiment gave his some type of super healing powers but I had to toss that asside. Cuz if thst were the case, why is he still limping from the very first wound he got?The movie ends there. There is so much more I could have included but this review is already long enough as it is! Do not believe the high ratings...there is no way they could be real. The movie has no redeeming qualities. The acting is awful as well. Watch at your own risk!"
" Almost so bad it's good but ultimately just bad
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,4,"A slow build-up that makes you wonder whether something interesting is about to happen (spoiler it doesn't). Then halfway through an about-turn and we are in a low budget action movie and then the final few scenes and its a cheesy 80s teen movie. Not sure whether this was meant to be a comedy or not, but 4 stars, because it made me laugh."
" Irresponsible Script
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,5,"Reasonably good acting, but too many plot holes, poor development, and unanswered questions. And the ending tries to be smirky clever but is lame in light of everything that has happened. As an aside: this is an innocent family still grieving a son and brother who died in the Army, and thus it was an extremely insensitive script."
" What does war do to a man?
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,6,"Adam Wingard's The Guest is an entertaining thriller, but if there ever was a film about the debilitating effects of war, here it is. The action sequences here are no different from any other action movie of recent years, but the underlying themes add an extra layer of meaning.The movie follows a soldier who appears at a family's doorsteps claiming to have fought alongside their deceased son in the army. The soldier, played suave, if not charming (and appropriately unhinged later in the film), by Dan Stevens, is welcomed into the family and allowed to sleep in his comrade's childhood bedroom. Soon, the family's daughter begins to suspect his involvement in a series of deaths that hit close to home.The soldier, a man by the name of David Collins, insinuates himself in the family's lives. David makes it his mission to ascertain whether they feel loved by the lost son, and improve their lives to the best of his abilities. The father - after multiple beers - confides in David and confesses to him his insecurities at work. The son, Luke, is inhibited and bullied, and the daughter, Anna, is stuck in a plodding relationship. The dad's superior is found inexplicably dead, the bullies are hospitalized, and the boyfriend is being penned for a murder he did not commit, with evidence heavily suggesting otherwise. Anna has her suspicions.There's a fine line being drawn between a hero and villain. Like a hero, David's actions are intended for the betterment of the family, but like a villain, the means are increasingly macabre. The fight scenes in the first act look on the surface to be badass, but the violence is not to be gawked at. For example, in an early scene set in a bar, David attacks a group of high school students. Many will invariably deem the fight ""cool,"" but what we have here is a grown man bullying kids. The morality of the students is questionable, but the course of action is gratuitous, nonetheless.There's the usual stuff like the convoluted and over-the-top reveal that David underwent a special intelligence experiment (technically a spoiler but I won't divulge the specifics). There's the obligatory scene where the daughter overhears the guest calling a hit. And there are some equally clichéd scenes sprinkled throughout.But protruding past the frankly familiar facade, the film offers a scathing look at not just what war does to soldiers and their families, but the damage the military itself does to people.David is a man made into a weapon by the military. This disregard for the sanctity of life is prominent throughout the film. A teacher is brutally stabbed by David and the camera pans to the corpse - lingering - to suggest that the bloody death is not a product of mental illness or substance abuse, but military intervention."
" A Good movie
",2020-06-18 00:00:00,7,"This movie made me feel that I'm spending an evening to watch TV's movie during 90's .
Even the plot has holes but I spent good time watching it , this is a truck of movies , smile plot but good acting and producer"
" Super violent
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,5,It wasn't bad compared to a lot of films. A little Life-time-ish. I was engaged for most of it.
" One Giant Plot Hole
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,1,"I'm surprised at all of the high ratings for this movie. I'm watching this in 2020 and I can say for certain that this movie wasn't good, not even for 2014.The plot for this movie was pretty over the top! There were so many holes in this movie all the way through the ending. The acting was subpar and there was no character development and backstory at all. Just some random guy who was friends with the protagonists' dead son/brother in the military.Not sure where they were trying to go with this one but if you are looking for time to waste because you have nothing better to do, then you may get a kick out of the action. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend watching."
" An OK Movie At Best
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,5,"06/16/2020 Within the first few minutes of this movie Dan Stevens (the principle male character) and Sheila Kelley (the mother) lack acting credibility as they both engage in insincere/unrealistic/not believable dialog. Neither does the storyline ring true, but putting all of that aside this movie will still hold the viewers interest until the end. Bon Appetit'Suggestion: If you want to watch an excellent ""Unwanted House Guest"" movie then consider watching ""The Perfect Host"" 2010 with David Hyde Pierce as the principle actor. That was a wonderful, fun filled, forever memorable movie!"
" Disappointing and predictable
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,4,"I hate to be one of those people that says, ""I knew that was gonna happen!"" However, I found myself saying it over and over again. This movie is predictable as hell, with some seriously stupid character decisions. I genuinely do not understand the high ratings. You can find much better thrillers out there."
" Not bad, except for the horrendous music
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,7,Sounded like a bad hair salon soundtrack. It detracted so much from the movie.
" Really??
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,2,What a waste of time ... although I echo Anna's last words but for different reasons
" Love Dan Stevens! Thumbs down on the movie
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,4,Absolutely love Dan Stevens! Can't wait to see him in a lot more films! Too bad this particular movie is lacking.
" I'm not sure if this was supposed to be quirky but....
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,2,I only gave it a 2 because this movie.....well honestly I'm not even sure why I gave it a 2. It just seemed really badly written and the acting was worse than a middle school play. It began okay but then just went down hill really quickly. I really started laughing at the movie as if it were a comedy. It was as bad as killer clowns from outer space and that movie was horrendous.
" We've been here before.
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,1,"Someone use the word ""unique"" in describing this movie. Unique it was not. Every cliche from every thriller movie. Predictable high school drama class acting. No spoiler alerts needed. You'll figure it all out before the endng."
" Terrible
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,1,"This movie is just complete nonsense. For starters, the lighting throughout is bad. The acting is subpar by most of the actors. The dialogue is amateurish. The action is okay. But the story itself is totally unbelievable. David leaves an obvious trail to follow, right from start. He is not subtle in any of the actions he takes so as not to blow his cover. Anna figures the whole thing out and tries to play detective, but does not call the police? You have a guy supposedly using a dead military man's identity, someone you are 100% positive has killed your friend and you are just going to enlist your friend and brother to help with your sleuthing...then also tell him you know? Then there is the incompetent secret military dept that comes after him with big guns and just storm trooper it up. He easily takes out all these men, kills a bunch more people without blinking then gets taken out by two teenagers. But wait...he pulls a Michael Myers at the very end! Oh and the soundtrack, complete garbage other than the obscure 90s song playing at the diner that fits nowhere in with the rest of the tunes."
" Don't believe the hype
",2020-06-13 00:00:00,4,"It's presented as this indie gem that's poking fun at its own cheesiness, but it really is just your good old B movie. And it's actually taking things too seriously to just be stupid fun; there are some parts that are laughably bad, I'll grant you that, but it's obvious they're just happy accidents."
" I Compare This Movie To A Half Bowl Of Rancid Oatmeal
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,6,This movie was clearly written by two different people who never discussed their ideas with one another. Writer One was developing the characters and had a decent story going; up to The Big Laundry Day Shootout. After that Writer Two took over and the story just ground to a halt. The half-developed characters became boring and I could swear they were replaced by cardboard puppets.
" There Are Other Movies
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,7,"I don't know why some thrillers need to be downright unbelievable.Homage. Stylized. Fine. This is some standard Blumhouse fare to me. If it weren't for the irredeemable guest.All that aside, the movie is definitely entertaining."
" Geez, what was that?
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,2,"The previous reviews must've been written by 12 year olds. There was nothing good or entertaining about this movie.The whole movie was ridiculous, but towards the end it because unbearable. I still can't believe I watched this all the way to the end."
" Entertaining, then stupid, then funny
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,7,"We liked it for the first 2/3, lots of action.Then when the army guys get involved the action became unrealistic and Keystone Cops like.It got to the point of being funny.Still, it was entertaining even after all of that.No problem with the actors, they seem to be well cast."
" DO NOT WATCH

" Gripping without even trying
",2020-05-14 00:00:00,8,"(WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD)
I really enjoyed this film, Dan Stevens plays a very convincing bad guy, his empty gaze when the camera is Close is very good and he portrays the character perfectly. The film is fairly slow with not much happening in the middle apart from an awesome fight scene. But being a slow film suited it perfectly whereas other films it ruins the movie. The character development is really good as you slowly start to see the ""real"" David Collins come out. David is one of those characters you really shouldn't like but can't help liking him. The movies twist is awesome, finding out that David is actually a medical experiment gone rogue is fantastic and after he kills the mum and dad who took him is such a good moment as it shows the emptiness of his character. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the ending. I'm all for a good cliff hanger but this one didn't suit the movie. So what happens is the brother who was supposedly his friend ends up stabbing him in the chest when David is trying to kill his sister. David falls to the floor as if he is dead. Then when the brother and sister are sitting in the ambulance you see David walk out dressed as a fireman and that's it. This is how I would have ended it. David managed to kill both the brother and sister showing that there is nothing he won't do to protect him self. He gets away with the murders and walks away from the school and the credits role. Then mid way through you see another family eating dinner and the door knocks the mother opens the door and David is there, he introduces himself in the exact way he did to the previous family and she lets him in and that's the end. That's just my opinion, however this film is great if you like action thrillers. Great movie."
" Embarrassing
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,3,"Poor acting, poor script, daft storyline, starts quite well but goes downhill from there. Dan Stevens is obviously looking for action men movies. Maybe not, Dan."
" Cracking Thriller
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,8,When a soldier turns up at a family's house whom are grieving the loss of their son in the war he claims to be have been there when he died and was a close friend. They welcome the guest into their home and their lives as way of coping with their loss and he immediately starts improving their fortunes. However his behaviour becomes more sinister as the stylish the thriller unravels leaving you wanting more a praising the excellent performance of Dan Stevens sad the charismatic guest.

",2020-04-30 00:00:00,2,"The movie was enjoyable until around the mid-point.Beyond that, it spiraled into a B flick at best.It was almost like to original screenwriter, director and producer were all replaced...so bad.Like a couple of the actors, so I hope they aren't remembered for this"
" Worst Movie ever
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,1,"Waste of time, most rubbish movie ever.... no idea at all"
" Brilliant
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,7,"I really liked this movie. It was short-medium length which was perfect as I never found myself getting bored and it wasn't rushed. The acting by David seemed a bit too much at first, but as the story progressed I found myself appreciating it a lot more. Feeling of suspense was also very well done. I haven't had a movie get my heart rate going in quite a while."

" Original

" enjoyable nonsense
",2020-01-14 00:00:00,7,It was off to a good start and kept me interested even if it was an old story. Got a bit silly at the end but the laughs were there all the way through. Dan stevens was great and over played the role to the hilt.
" Unordered notes and remarks
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,8,"Genre: Suspense, Action
+ amazing, energetic soundtrack (synth?)
+ good performance from especially Dan Stevens
+ very captivating atmosphere and immense suspense~ premise gets introduced very skillfully so that it is at least a bit believable
~ starts out very cryptic and suspense is generated by lack of knowledge; then gives some information and ratchets up the actionending that is both strange and cliche at the same time"
" It is so bad its funny
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,1,"Let me tell you guys, don't waste your time watching this one. even a kid can write a better plot. Really!! The genre of this movie is action-comedy, but it is actually an action movie. yet it so bad its funny as well."
" Came for soundtrack, stayed for the plot
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,9,I am a great fan of industrial music so when I found out that there is the soundtrack by DAF and also some gothic rock bands I knew I have to watch it. Moreover the main character is portrayed by Dan Stevens that I loved in Legion. So I found the movie the next day and oh boy it is good. The secret of his personality is not revealed till the end. And the finale is a thrilling action. I am just careful not to spoil anything that much I think it is great to advise to all the people.
" Seriously, don't bother.
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,3,"After reading a lot of the reviews on this film, I thought I couldn't go wrong. What I watched, simply did not match the rave write ups! It was cheesy, predictable, and very badly done. So...I decided to re-read the reviews; anything with 7/10 score or higher was clearly a fake as they used the same descriptions and wording."
" Cool
",2019-10-16 00:00:00,8,Awesome music and acting. The fight scenes are legit!
" The Guest
",2019-10-02 00:00:00,9,"""The Guest"" is a 2014 action thriller film directed by Adam Wingard and written by Simon Barrett (You're Next) that is a must watch in October. David, a veteran (played by Dan Stevens who gives a perfect performance), shows up at the Peterson's residence that consists of two parents (Sheila Kelley and Leland Orser), a daughter (Maika Monroe from It Follows), and a son (Brendan Meyer) claiming to have served with and have been the best friend of their son Caleb who died in the war and it's his mission to assist Caleb's family in any way he can. David's charming personality and the family's grief leads to him staying at their house, but there's always something a little off about David when he's not being watched. Without getting into spoilers, strange things begin to happen that seem to be related to his presence and the plot moves on from there. Shots of Halloween decorations and bare trees really set the fall atmosphere and is done subtly enough to call this a Halloween movie. The Guest has a kick-ass soundtrack of music from the 80's ranging all the way to modern times in an alternate universe where everyone listens to goth industrial synth-wave. Did I mention it's hilarious too? There are some genuinely funny moments even after things get intense, but it's a weird dark kind of humor that might not work for everyone but gets more laughs of out me than most recent comedies do. To quickly describe the film, I would say its Terminator meets Halloween, and it works exceedingly well. It's safe to say that The Guest is not only my favorite Halloween-time movie, its one of my favorite movies of all time."
" Dan Steven's the man..
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,9,"Few movies are run so successfully by a single actor as this. Dan Stevens as 'David' hooks us to the very end and even though he's the baddie, we start rooting for him and hope he doesn't die. Which eventually happens.
Loved the film. Dan Stevens with his near perfect expressions for every scene."
" Bourne again
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,5,"The Guest is a routine action horror thriller of a stranger that starts out to be helpful. He is just hiding his psychotic feelings underneath.David Collins (Dan Stevens) turns up on the doorstep of the Peterson household. He tells mum Laura that he served in the army with her son Caleb who was killed in Afghanistan.David swiftly fits in with the family who have been badly affected with the death of Caleb. David helps out son Luke who is being bullied at high school. Only daughter Anna is suspicious when her boyfriend is arrested for murder.When the military police show up, all hell breaks loose. David is a one man killing machine who took part in some secret army program like the one Jason Bourne took part in.With it electronic score, The Guest harks back to those straight to video horror thrillers of the 1980s like Hider in the House.It is a serviceable film, Dan Stevens puts up a spirited performance but it quickly falls apart by the end."

" Visually beautiful but unoriginal mash of violence
",2019-07-22 00:00:00,5,"The myriad references to other films like The Terminator and Jason Bourne show how unoriginal this flick truely is. Although well acted and masterfully filmed, the plot is simply a little too predictable.The positives about this film are well known to those who read other reviews here: David (Dan Stevens) is portrayed by a strong, charismatic actor who keeps you watching till the end. The good-looking characters, locations and outfits are all neatly displayed by a professional team of film makers. (Though I would be utterly surprised to find a waitress wearing a stunning outfit like that in real life.)The catch, however, is the predictable truth behind the mysterious smile of main character David. I guessed he could either be a cyborg, a mutant, or some other superhuman creature. He turns out to be a military experiment by the government, my oh my. Accompanied by the obligate wave of violence and nearly indestructible qualities of the anti-hero (himself, David) in the story.Ideologically, this movie is not far away from a glorification of violence and war. It seems logical that the viewer will root for the irresistible David, who lures every character towards weapons or drugs/alcohol. This character type could have been interesting, if it hadn't been used a million times before. The mould of an attractive, rebellious but lethal protagonist has been explored many times in the past.As the film's income didn't surpass its budget, it's safe to say that it is more suitable as an example for upcoming directors of photography (hence the professional visuals) than for an average audience capable of predicting David's unrealistic martial art skills from miles away."
" Thrilling, funny, stylish and unique
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,10,"""The Guest"" surprised me in a tremendous way!
All the acting was great, especially from Dan Stevens, who gave a hostile vibe to the character of ""David"".
The action sequences were incredibly well shot, the score was fantastic and the ending at the Halloween themed school party with the horror maze and songs like ""Vengeance"" by Perturbator or ""Anthonio"" by Annie playing became one of my favorite scenes in a movie!
The Guest is a truly unique Horror/Thriller masterpiece!"
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,7,"This is an example of a great ""regular"" movie. interesting, suspenseful, and good albeit brief action. a touch of horror and 80s movies. great soundtrack, reminded me a lot of Drive's (1 viewing)"
" Fun Thriller
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,7,"This is a low-budget little thriller with some awesome action moments, some witty dialogue, and an overall great tone and atmosphere. While I wouldn't go so far as to call this a horror film, it certainly has some thrilling moments. I'd recommend this to people who like action flicks, thrillers, or 80s vibes. It might be predictable, but that doesn't take away the amount of fun it provides."
" A Caller Who Just ""Wanted To Help""
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,7,"This tightly paced action thriller uses an extraordinary mash-up of influences from various genres of old movies to entertain in a stylised fashion that's guaranteed to please nostalgia freaks and the many fans who will find its combination of horror, dark humour and suspense completely irresistible. Its straightforward set-up creates an expectation of what's to follow and that's exactly what's delivered in a plot that's completely devoid of any real twists or surprises but is nevertheless redeemed to a great extent by the charismatic Dan Stevens, some exceptionally well-executed action sequences and the subtle and well managed way in which the tension early on the movie is allowed to develop and grow so naturally before the point at which things really start to heat up.Recently discharged Army Sergeant David Collins (Dan Stevens) calls at the home of Laura Peterson (Sheila Kelley) whose son Caleb had been killed in the Afghanistan war and as well as describing how Caleb was feeling at the time of his death, tells the distressed Laura that he and Caleb were good friends and points to a photograph that she has on display in her home in which he's standing close to her son. David is soft-spoken, well mannered and polite and Laura invites him to stay overnight so that he can tell the rest of the family about Caleb's time in the Army.Caleb's younger brother Luke (Brendan Meyer) quickly bonds with David who becomes his protector against a group of boys who regularly bully him at his High School and Caleb's father, who self-medicates heavily with alcohol and has work problems, also starts to enjoy David being around. On the other hand, Caleb's teenage sister Anna (Maika Monroe) doesn't take to the family's new houseguest so readily and treats him with considerable caution. Despite this, she allows herself to be persuaded to take him to a party at her friend Kristen's (Tabatha Shaun) house where he deals very effectively with a problem that his hostess has with her difficult ex-boyfriend and then sleeps with her.Now enjoying an apparently open-ended stay at the Petersons' place and having favourably impressed almost everyone, David even briefly softens Anna's resistance when he makes positive comments about her tastes in music and shows off his impressive physique when he emerges from the shower at her home. Despite all this, Anna's suspicions persist and when she makes a call to an Army base to find out more about David, sets off the dramatic, spectacular and terrifying sequence of events that propel the story to its crazy conclusion which neatly paves the way for a sequel.With echoes of ""The Terminator"" (1984) and a number of John Carpenter influences (the action's even set in the ""Halloween"" period), ""The Guest"" features a character that's similar to those played by Mark Wahlberg in ""Fear"" (1996) and Rebecca De Mornay in ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle""(1992). The plot resembles that of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (1943) and the hall of mirrors sequence is reminiscent of a memorable part of Orson Welles' ""The Lady from Shanghai"" (1947). Depending on the viewer's point of view, this type of ""cut and paste"" movie-making could be seen as either rampant plagiarism or a glorious example of unbridled postmodernism. Either way, the result is highly entertaining, disarmingly simple and at times, surprisingly humorous."
" Loved the acting of Dan Stevens!
",2019-05-29 00:00:00,8,"Amazing film from all prospects. Beautiful acting by the main character. It's hard to find such actors nowadays. I won't give you guys any spoilers, watch it for yourself but on a scale of grades (A+, A, B, C, D & F), i will give it A."
" As ridiculous as they come, but great fun
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,7,"I wasn't at all prepared for what 'The Guest' had in store but I'm certainly glad I decided to watch it. Although I was expecting something a bit more serious, and with a more credible plot, I can't really complain as this was ultimately a very enjoyable film that seemed to fly by.While primarily an action thriller, 'The Guest' is also many other things and has elements of horror and drama, as well as satire and black comedy. Perhaps surprisingly, it all comes together well and the result is a slick, stylish and very entertaining film. Though, if you try to take the storyline and characters seriously, it's probably going to be more frustrating that entertaining as both are completely ridiculous.Don't think too much and don't go in with any expectations, and you are sure to be entertained!"
" Endlessly fun.
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,9,"Stevens has a great ability to turn on the charm in one moment, then drop it and go deadly serious in the next, and the way you're never sure what's actually coming out of David is one of the film's pleasures."
" You will see EVERYTHING coming
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,1,"Predictable at every step.
Unearned and unexplained premise.
Creaky script.
Wooden performances.
Very poor."
" Great 80's homage
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,8,"There's a way to do an 80's homage right and this hits all those notes, soundtrack, mood, bouncing between comedy and horror, etc. Sure the plot is typical, but the comedy hits and the wild swing to horror/action at the end at least feels earned. Awesome music make this a solid Carpenter riff."
" The Guest
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,6,"Soldier Stephens arrives on the doorstep of a family home claiming to be a friend of their, killed in action son.Nothing remarkably new to see here, but this is a well crafted thriller with a fine menacing performance by Stephens - a bit like Rambo without the muscles or the scenery chewing."
" Super entertaining with slick soundtrack and superb acting by Stevens
",2019-02-06 00:00:00,7,"I stumbled upon this movie accidentally while watching TV and decided to give it a shot since there was nothing better on. I would have probably never decided to watch it deliberately because of the unsavory topic. And that would be a mistake.Two things really stand out in this movie: Dan Stevens' acting and soundtrack. Stevenson plays this super calm and, as you can guess from the beginning, highly trained soldier who one day just shows up at the doorstep of some family who had lost their son in combat. He tells the mother how he knew her son, gets acquainted with the family and stays with them. Here you can see how good has Stevens pulled out this role (David): he was successful at being mysterious and somehow at the same time pretty familiar in a sense of having something familiarly odd about him. Throughout the first half you are never completely sure about who David is, what his plans are, is he a good or a bad guy and yet you know something will go wrong. You can smell that he's probably dangerous and that he takes advantage od family's sorrow. This creates tension which keeps the movie going and leads to paroxysm in which you finally meet real David and see what he's capable of and, very importantly, why he is capable of those things.Soundtrack is slick and helps to give a finishing touch. Annies' 'Anthonio' Berlin breakdown version playing in some scenes is hard for me to get out of head. This movie proves that great soundtrack can make up for superficial plot and make movie much more enjoyable and smooth. Plus, songs playing match David's character and make him look more as deus ex machina and a helping nice guy he purportedly is.Given the perspective a viewer has, which is, unlike main protagonists, that of having all information about what's happening, The Guest is very entertaining to watch coupled with great soundtrack. Don't expect something special or deep and you're surely have fun watching it. Even the critics gave this movie high rating which rarely happens with this genre. Hope I got you at least a little interested in seeing it!"
" 2 stars and we were kind...
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,1,"No way this movies is rated 6,7 on IMDB at the time of writing this review. Too many flaws to count.I am bewildered why people would rate this movies more than 1 star, why? it is so bad."
" So bad it's good!
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,5,"My Rating : 5/10If you've ever seen a decent action/thriller you'll know just how bad this is. I went in with no expectations and with a 6.7 IMDb rating from 80,000 voters I thought to give it a shot.It's a bad movie, let's be honest. BUT...it's so good that you really want to see the whole thing because it's entertaining. I should be giving it a 1/10 rating but it entertained me so I'm gonna go with 5/10."
" Good thriller!
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,7,"For some time, it is hard for me to find a good thriller. Then, I've stumbled across this one here. The story is simple but believable - at least for me, since there was war in my country a few decades ago.
First of all - Dan Stevens is incredible in his role! He carries the entire movie - you can't help yourself but to like him, but you know you shouldn't. Really, but REALLY cool good/bad guy. From the beginning, you can see something isn't right, but waiting for the climax as he story progresses is really fun to watch. I like Maika Monroe from ""It Follows"", and in ""The Guest"" she is far more attractive to me, probably 'cause her appearance of a smart ""bad girl"". Another guy I really liked here is Lance Reddick from ""Fringe"" and ""John Wick"" and boy, these secret service guy roles suits him well! The rest of the cast was really good, but again - Dan Stevens is unbeatable in his ""David"" role!If you like good thrillers, go make yourself a popcorn and enjoy this one, hope this one won't disappoint."
" Good acting from Stevens in a standard thriller plot
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,7,"Someone comes into your life, you lend them your trust, then they turn out to be complete psychopaths. Classic plot, slightly reminiscent of your ex, so you add something more sinister, like a military experiment and a big showdown at the end. That's the entire movie. If it weren't for Dan Stevens in the central role, I would have called this a failure; as such, it's merely mediocre.To me, the entire external explanation, the military connection, was superfluous. Psychos don't need explanation, they are naturally born as a percent of the normal population. Instead of focusing on the real cause of fear: someone lacking any trace of empathy betraying your trust, they had an entire third of the movie be about guns and explosions. Oh, and that WTF ending. Literally. It was painful.Watch The Talented Mr. Ripley instead of this."

" The worst movie ever
",2018-10-04 00:00:00,1,I can't believe I waisted my time watching this film !!!
" worth watching
",2018-09-30 00:00:00,8,Terrific performance by Dan Stevens. Not a big worthy plot.But great in making.Realistic and entertaining.
" SUBJECT STILL ACTIVE
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,7,"David (Dan Stevens) visits the family of a fallen comrade. They welcome him with open arms, but as a family they have their issues with bulling, boyfriends, and work. However, now that David is there, their problems are being solved, and not in the best way possible.This is another special ops helps family movie, not as cute as ""The Pacifier"" but certainly darker. We know David is not quite right from the subscript and crazed look in his eye, and it is just a matter of time before super polite David, the answer to their prayers becomes their deadly nightmare. The film kept me engaged although the MIB scenes seemed a bit hokey.Guide: F-bomb. No nudity. Quickly implied sex scene."
" Timeless
",2018-08-14 00:00:00,7,"The Guest is a film without a time period. And I mean that because they managed to make a present day film that feels like it could have taken place at any point in the last 50 years. It gives off an 80's vibe but also a post vietnam/Taxi Driver-esque feeling that is unsettling to say the least. Perhaps even more unsettling is Dan Stevens' performance as ""David"", a war veteran who returns to the family home of his supposed friend who died along with him overseas. What continues as the film dives deeper into David's psyche, is thrilling and surprising. The mysterious events that unfold as a result of his appearance bring a fascinating wrinkle into his story. However, I don't think the pay-off in the third act nearly lived up to all that was presented in the first hour. Sometimes mysteries are better left unsaid and I don't believe the choice they made about his motivations were nearly as interesting as it was initially presented. It tries to balance the line of revealing too much or not revealing enough, and I'm honestly not sure which I would have preferred more. But I guess that's just how some of these things go. Even still, the performances are terrific, the score/soundtrack is brilliant, and the direction is undoubtedly inspired.7.7/10"
" Old school style but has issues
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,6,"I really enjoyed this film. As so many others have previously remarked it has a retro feel to it harkening back to 1980s thrillers complete with campy, synthesized music. It is also unmistakably inspired by Halloween as the holiday is the backdrop of the movie with tacky decorations in nearly every scene. But the film isn't about the style or the inspiration, it's about the mystery and the tension. David Collins is a recently discharged soldier who suddenly appears at the home of his army buddy, Caleb Peterson, who died in Iraq. Collins explains to his Caleb's mother, Mrs. Peterson, that he promised Caleb he would check on his family should he die. With his affable charm and simple, direct yet respectful way of communication David is taken in by the Peterson family and soon treated as one of their own. Even though there an enigmatic vibe about Collins he also demonstrates a protective nature for the family. However, a series of strange events and unsolved deaths in the small town slowly (and I do mean slowly) ensue which catch the attention of Caleb's sister, once a potential love interest, who grows increasingly alarmed about Collins's activities. There are also several clues dropped that Collins is not who he says he is. Her suspicions inspire her to makes some inquiries with the government about David Collins. Once his location is made known to a certain shadowy organization within the military they mobilize to apprehend him. From there all hell breaks loose. Dan Stevens was fantastic in this. From the start you don't know whether to like him, fear him, trust him, but he does capture your attention and keep it throughout the film. Because you know he has a secret. I think of him as Michael Meyers with dialogue and without the Shatner mask. I have two problems with The Guest. First is the pacing, it is at places very dull and unmoving. But the real problem I have is the development of Collins. By the time it is established that he isn't David Collins but rather an escaped participant from a military project gone awry we want to know more but are denied. We are given only scraps of supporting information about his past and his motivations. For example, it is never really made plain why he appeared at Caleb Peterson's home to begin with other than a passing line about his mission, whatever that means. Other plot and character developments are left hanging such as his plastic surgery, who was the real David Collins, and who is he really? What is HIS real name? Who is the guy he now looks like it in the photo with Caleb and his unit? It's all very confusing and frustrating. I understand it was deliberate choice by the director to leave his character to a certain extent ambiguous but it seems to go too far. Whatever happened to Collins, or whoever he is, during this military project is tied directly to the actions in this film. It doesn't make a lot of sense to deprive the viewer with at least a decent amount of cogent knowledge to support what's happening in the plot. Anyway, it is a decent thriller. Not perfect, not entirely satisfying, but good enough that I watched it twice to see if I missed anything about who Collins really is. Nope, still in the dark about that."
" What the hell
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,4,"The only thing that is good about this movie is Dan Stevens. The story is promising in the beginning but in the end I was so disappointed. They didn't handled explanation, other actors were really bad and half of the stuff weren't important at all."
" Beware the unknown soldier
",2018-06-27 00:00:00,6,"Although now given the opportunity to helm a much more mainstream and better financed thriller, it's abundantly clear that director Adam Wingard remains a true horror fanatic at heart. I wasn't necessarily the biggest fan of projects like ""V/H/S"" or ""You're Next"", but at least they were authentically raw and relentlessly violent horror accomplishments. ""The Guest"" is also brutish and bloody, but with a more commercial and socially relevant plot (the loyalty between, and the difficult reintegration of, war veterans) and a much slower tension building. But you don't fool us, Mr. Wingard, because particularly the revelation of the truth behind David's malicious behavior, and the entire climax set in a school hall decorated for Halloween, unmistakably reveal that you still prefer horror. The basic story is very identifiable for many people/families, but also original and dramatic enough to attract the attention of wide audiences. A mysterious but seemingly friendly and sincere soldier shows up at the doorstep of the Peterson family and claims he fought alongside their beloved son and brother Caleb who unfortunately got killed in action in Iraq. The grieving parents unconditionally welcome David into their home, the much younger brother immediately idolizes him and only the teenage daughter Anna is somewhat skeptical and doubtful about his real intentions. David turns out to be a dangerous but very manipulative and intelligent psychopath, while Anna is quickly considered as insensitive for suspecting him. ""The Guest"" unfolds like a typical early 90s thriller, because back then there were numerous of these false identity/charming intruder flicks (""The Good Son"", ""The Stepfather"", ""Raising Cain"", ""Bad Influence"", ...) and it felt rather refreshing to watch! The build-up perhaps takes slightly too long and contains too many clichéd situations, but the extreme change in tone and pace comes very abrupt and forceful. The last 15-20 minutes are also incredibly vile, with a few shocking deaths and ice-cold executions. The acting performances are more than adequate, with solidly convincing roles for Dan Stevens and Maika Monroe. The latter suddenly became a popular horror siren thanks to her part in the unexpected cult hit ""It Follows""."
" Weak is all I could say
",2018-06-27 00:00:00,5,"I was expecting more of a back story after all this tension build up in the first hour, so this was a disappointment. A guy who escapes a team of highly-trained killers, is almost killed by two teenagers. Very convincing."
" Started great but oh boy
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,4,"The fantastic acting and atmosphere certainly got me hooked from the start. The 80s music and vibe is brilliant and reminded me alot of It Follows, which is interesting as this is the same actress who was acting there as well.
I had a theory about what was going on with the ""guest"", clearly something was off about him right? Unfortunately, the whole thing turned into some weird story that was so unoriginal and stupid, that I didn't even care about the ending by this point."
" So incredibly bad....
",2018-05-24 00:00:00,2,"I've learned that you can't trust the reviews that give an overly lengthy description that includes the names of the writers, directors, and the actors. You also can't trust those who give a synopsis instead of a review...Those people are so obviously paid to write a review for a movie. This is true review from someone who likes to watch movies for nothing other that the entertainment factor.... and I can tell you this movie absolutely sucked! There is no way this movie was made in 2014 as it has a complete 80's vibe and not it a good way. The music was boring and uneventful and the acting was horrible and cheesy. If it wasn't for the gratuitous nudity in one scene, this would only be worthy of a Lifetime movie...and that is giving it too much credit."
" B grade entertainment
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,4,"To be honest I watched this movie solely based on the reviews and its rating on IMDB.I was pretty disappointed. An unimaginative plot line and virtually no character build up. You just can't really care about these people as you know so little about most of them. And what's this thing with Americans and guns? As with so many US movies this ends in a massive shoot out. The twist at the end is risible, to say the least.An ideal movie to watch with pizza, a few beers and friends. When you want something in the background that you don't really have to concentrate on to follow - it's that predictable.."
" Should be better than it is...
",2018-03-22 00:00:00,3,"This film has all the potential to be a cult classic. The director has clearly studied 70s and 80s cult movies very closely and incorporated all the right elements, but that's exactly the result; a pastiche thats trying really hard to be cult, but ends up failing because of it. 
There are some great moments, but the plot is incoherent, stumbling from camp thriller to psychedelic slasher with no sense of direction. The same goes for the acting, which ranges from tense and serious to deliberately hammy. 
Overall, this movie is a mess. It's not unwatchable, but it's extremely irritating, as it could have been so much better."
" Enjoyed until final scene
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,5,"Final scenes at the schools Halloween set was a letdown, other than that enjoyed the change of character from start of film to this point"
" Overacting by the lead actor and a illogical but still watchable
",2018-03-01 00:00:00,6,"The movie has some good actions scenes but has many plot issues, watch only if you have some time to kill and you dont look for logics"
" The young MacGruber
",2017-12-23 00:00:00,8,"This movie was pretty good.
It's like watching a young MacGruber kicking ass and shooting with guns at people, and always staying in control of the situation.."
" Very Entertaining worth a watch but slightly overrated
",2017-11-25 00:00:00,7,The guest is a very well made movie with great direction and soundtrack. It is definitely entertaining because of the great performance from Dan Stevens and Maika Monroe. The movie sets up mysterious atmosphere really well which contributes to a great beginning but it does lose its thriller touch after the halfway mark. I gave it 7/10 because it wasn't very ambitious in trying to maintain the tension throughout the movie but on the bright side it still manages to be good enough to keep you entertained till the end. Do i recommend ? Yes But don't go expecting a movie worth a Metascore of 76
" Pretty meaningless ""programmed soldier"" fare
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,6,"Director Adam Wingard's lack of interest in convention chimed neatly with Dan Stevens's desire to distance himself from ""Downton Abbey"" in the weird and not-so-wonderful piece of film-making that is ""The Guest"". As I noted in my less-than-fulsome review of the (2015) film ""The Boy Next Door"", ""The Guest"" - or rather Stevens's portrayal of that guest, bears quite a striking resemblance to the work of Ryan Guzman as Noah in that other (apparently later) film. Sporting a serviceable American accent (somewhat recalling that of Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes), the Brit Stevens appears as David, who starts off by bringing such joy and enrichment to - and a kind of justice on behalf of - a mourning family, that it is all the sicker (and ultimately all the more implausible-looking) when he later turns on said family, which he kills and/or terrorises, in the course of killing and terrorising pretty much everyone else too. Of course, he can't actually help it because - in the second film that emerges out of the cocoon of the first - he is actually a ""modified"" soldier programmed to kill everyone around him once the safeties are taken off. That is a message that could be offered deeper treatment (as it is somewhat more so in films like ""Morgan""), but not too much so in this film.Do I need to say more? The film is violent, at times a bit erotically-charged and all-in-all rather pointless, though one cannot exactly say it is badly-acted. For my money, Maika Moore does especially well here, while poor old Lance Reddick (again playing a somewhat Broyles-like part) hardly gets into his stride before being bumped off. Stevens himself is OK."
" ""Oh Anthonio, my Anthonio, was I ever more than just a face in the crowd?""
",2017-09-09 00:00:00,9,"I felt intrigued by the work of Adam Wingard after watching one of his short movies in the V/H/S. Now that he stepped up to make an indie movie, I was kind of interested. And thus, The Guest was born.The Guest is horror-thriller movie, which stars Dan Stevens, Maika Monroe and other not so very known actors. What confuses me about the categorization of this movie, is the ""horror"" label. This movie isn't horror, HOWEVER it is made to LOOK like a horror movie. To be exact, The Guest is a homage to 80's slasher flicks, and it does it without ripping off any movie really.==== SPOILER ALERT / SPOILER ALERT / SPOILER ALERT ==== Plot: A man claiming to be the friend of a son, that the Petersen family lost visits the family in an effort to take care of them. However, soon it is discovered that this new visitor is much more on the surface.The plot sure is something new. Never have I seen really an idea so well incorporated into a feature length movie, that The Guest succeeds at. The movie is essentially built up as a horror movie, particularly a 80's slasher. That's what makes this movie kind of enjoyable, as it tries to pay homage to then known horror movies with scream queens, unstoppable antagonists and synthwave/retro music popularized by John Carpenter.Acting: Dan Stevens comes off as an interesting, but ominous character, that has charisma and intelligence. Every time he was on screen, his influence could be seen on the other characters as well. The interaction between characters is also very very well done. Its fluid and smooth, because in here you actually CARE about the family members and even the guest himself becomes extremely likable. Character development is strong with this movie at least, so if you want to see that sort of interaction, this movie is fit for that. Here's a bit of a spoiler: there's a scene with two characters discussing on keeping a secret from flowing outside by putting it just between them. It tells about professionalism, that these officials have for the sake of the plot and the pacing.Soundtrack: As the movie is basically a 80's slasher flick, the entire OST consists of remixes of electronic songs or completely made up songs that feature synthwave/electro punk/wave genres. This is one aspect, that makes this movie feel like a blast from the past.Cinematography: Not much can be said about it, however there are several shots of Dan Steven's character looking straight into the camera for a handful of seconds. Even though his expressions are neutral, he still looks menacing, especially due to the fact that he is a tad bit too friendly.Overall: The movie is one of those gems, that people will eventually come to. It has great acting, music and action to keep it refreshing and original. It's pacing is one of the best things, as said before, since its developed as a horror movie from start to finish. I recommend The Guest for those wanting something different and organic. It's fun, thrilling and enjoyable. 9/10."
" Taut, well-acted thriller
",2017-08-19 00:00:00,8,"When I finished watching ""The Guest"" on Canadian Netflix last night, I thought, finally, I've seen a movie on Netflix that wasn't mediocre.The Guest is a taut, finely acted thriller that, even if derivative, delivers tension, drama and mystery in spades. Dan Stevens as the mysterious David chews up the scenery and delivers as a muscular stranger who oozes the potential for trigger-happy violence throughout the movie. He's like a lean, younger version of Stanley Kowalski. Respect goes also to Maika Monroe for her commanding performance as a young woman in her late teens who exudes sexuality and insouciance typical of so many teenage girls. Yet her character rises to the occasion when presented with no other option. Brendan Myer as her younger,awkward, bullied brother shines in his role as well.The dramatic pacing of the movie was quite well done too, from the eerie opening scene to the final 30 seconds, which left this viewer wondering whether we might see a sequel."
" I need to write this review
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,10,"let me start by saying this a ""throw-away"" movie, by that i mean i expected it to be garbage, but it only cost £1 so i'm not bothered if its a massive flop.I found myself bored yesterday, so decided to chuck this movie in the ps3, like i mentioned before i wasn't expecting much, however within the first 10 minutes i was hooked. I have no idea who Dan Stevens is but his performance was incredible, he makes a psychotic killer seem like a cool friendly guy. As we see his progression from a random nice guy, to a FBI slaying madman you can't help but root for the guy. The other characters in the film are mostly well played Brendan Meyer ""Luke"" being another favourite of mine. This is one of those unassuming movies and my god I'm glad it watched it, definitely up there on my list now. Just reading through IMDb before posting this and apparently it did terrible in sales, which is a massive shame as its an incredibly well done film with some great talent, i cannot recommend it enough"
" Good movie
",2017-07-28 00:00:00,7,"The Guest is actually a good movie. Even though the idea of the story is probably a bit cliché and quite predictable, but i do not complain. The acting is good, that is one plus point you can enjoy. I can feel the atmosphere change when the guest was being confronted of what he did, and also i can feel the tense when he intimidated Anna. .There's a plot hole in the story, but it doesn't really matter. We have to realize that the real story is actually about the failure project of the government when they tried to make a super soldier. As it apparently turned wrong, the government tried to hunt ""the guest"" down. And of course, you can easily guess the rest of the story ;) .Lesson learned: don't trust stranger who comes to your house and claims to know your family. . . . . Dan Stevens is a real fine LOL"
" Peep This Reviews
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,7,"It's a nice little flick that you will not see coming. It doesn't pull any punches and doesn't play by the rules. A true exercise in the horror that war can create but not on the battle fields. Exceptional script, cast and direction. It has a very retro '80's Halloween slasher vibe but isn't dated in the least."
" put 2 and 2 together
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,1,"(spoiler alert maybe) Okay first of all when you watch this (curse word) dumb movie and he shows up, he kills the parents then he dies but, why was he even there this is a dumb movie don't waste your time it sucks and i wanna sure the director but i cant so, anyway when he dies the movie just ends, and for what he never even explained why he was there in the first place the (curse word) movie sucks (curse word) Okay i put the curse word boxes because they wouldn't let me put an actual one but this movie is so horrible"
" Excellent Film, worth watching multiple times
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,10,"I first watched the Film, when it came out, with some friends. Back then all off us even through skeptical at the beginning about the quality, liked it in the end because of how the film developed and was thoughtfully played. Saw the film on some film streaming site recently and decided to re-watch it because I could not remember the full plot any more.During the whole Film you get a feeling of something being off but it is hard to guess what it is. Scenes seem very natural and in a way that it could even happen that way for the most part. The music during the Film supports and creates an atmosphere fitting for the current plot.All in all this is probably one of the few films I will still re-watch in years to come."
" Not worth the time
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,3,"I just can't believe some of the comments here. It's a totally predictable movie with no horror, thrill or action whatsoever. It's a wonder how it got this rating. You've probably seen hundred more movies with the same plot so just save your time and do anything else rather than watching this movie.The only interesting side of the movie could be the music. That's all"
" An unpredictable thriller with colorful lightning
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,7,"'The Guest' is a stereotype-defying thriller with great acting, nice action scenes and real shocker plot twists. A really unpredictable movie - at the start you can't really fathom where the story is going to go and when some secrets are revealed you still can't even guess which characters end up dead.The movie actually combines horror into its action thriller premise. The ending sequence is straight out of a 90's slasher movie.Visually the movie was endlessly pleasing. There are a lot of quiet-type characters and a lot of mystery in the air, so you have a lot of time just processing the production values. The movie takes place in a small town, not much to say about that, but the lighting and the music takes the cake. It's one of those 'neon-noir' movies like 'Drive' or 'John Wick' with colorful lightning and retro synth soundtracks and I hope they make more of this style of movie because it just works."
" One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, and it has everything to do with Dan Stevens' performance
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,10,"Without Dan Stevens' performance the movie would have been corny and cringe-worthy. Instead I was on the edge of my seat and wanted to understand the meaning in every flicker of his countenance and sardonic smile.In addition to the soundtrack, which only heightens the on screen tension, his enigmatic portrayal steals the show."
" This movie utterly fantastic
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,10,"This movie is personally my favourite movie of all time. I realize this movie does has flaws, the script for the story was rushed and I wish it wasn't because the David's backstory is s**t. Even with that MY GOD Dan motherf**king Stevens, you brought a tears of joy to my eyes, you beautiful man. In all seriousness Dan's acting is amazing in this movie. Dan plays an ex-military visiting his deceased friends family to talk and help them in their sons absence. Dan is mysterious, edgy, cold and has a strong presence in the movie. This is what makes Dan so good. rest of the cast are meh, good just not up there with Dan and Lance Reddick was poor. The action in this movie is very good for its budget, well thought out and not Michael Bayish. Finally the soundtrack is special in this movie, it helps the movie so well in building atmosphere and David's (Dan's character) presence."
" Such an underrated film, it's shocking.
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,9,"I mean yeah, there are some parts in this movie that can be a bit cliché or even a typical horror situation. Who's to say that hasn't happened in other classical thrillers or horrors? Whoever rates this movie bad because of that, then that is a poor under-experienced judgement. If classics can score an 8 like the lovable slasher movie 'Halloween', then this movie certainly deserves more credit! Watch this film for its awesome music scores and thrilling scenes. And get the gross income higher because it is definitely worthy of it."
" A stranger is welcomed by a despondent family.
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,8,"Adam Wingard superbly directs this dramatic blood-fest. A young, charming stranger named David (Dan Stevens) arrives at the home of the Peterson family claiming to be a friend of their late son, Caleb, killed in combat. They welcomed him with open arms, but soon things just don't seem right about him. And when a string of unexplained deaths comes to light, members of the family wonder if David even served with Caleb at all.Some of the scenes are jaw dropping and the sound helps keep your mind focused. Not a wasted moment and not a movie that has all of its ducks in a row. You can almost read David's mind before he goes into action; and yet most situations are not as predictable as you think. Blood, mayhem and suspense.Stevens is charismatic and Maika Monroe, as Anna Peterson, is very watchable. Also in the cast: Brendan Meyer, Lance Reddick, Tabatha Shaun, Chase Williams and Leland Orser."
" Let the Strange One In
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,7,"Having charmed his way into the home of a recently deceased man he fought beside, a mysterious young soldier begins to help out his newfound surrogate family in increasingly violent ways in this strange yet undeniably intriguing independent film. Dan Stevens hits the nail on the head in the title role with an unpredictable wildness only just visible beneath his excessively polite and friendly exterior, and while it is easy to predict that something darker lurks beneath his facade, the first half of the film constantly keeps one guessing as to what exactly is going on. The second half of the film does not quite work as well with a vague suggestion that Stevens is some sort of super- soldier gone rogue in angle that leaves open far more questions than it ever answers, and while the film deserves some credit for having the most literal WTF ending ever, the lack of any solid explanation leaves one wanting more (some exposition scenes were apparently deleted). The second half of the film does, however, feature one of the most deliciously delirious thriller climaxes of all time, set in a 'Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' style Halloween maze constructed in the local high school's auditorium. Steve Moore's original score, clearly inspired by a lot of 80s music, is a very nice touch too and the action scenes towards the end are extremely well filmed. Whether the film clicks as a satire of military experimentation or a parable of war changing men may be debatable, however, there is little denying that it is one of the most audiovisually arresting thrillers of recent time."
" The Guest
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,7,"'The Guest' is a surprisingly fun throwback to 1980s horror. It boasts a thumping soundtrack and quick cuts that really fit into the theme of the film. The exaggerated scenes of violence and gore may be a bit too strange for those who do not appreciate the sentimentality and nostalgia of the movie.The narrative is very straightforward and follows Dan Stevens, an ex-soldier, as he returns to his friend's family's house as a dying wish. He protects and helps them through their individual problems but all is not what it seems. The film does lose it's way slightly towards the end as it tries to drastically remind audiences that the film is meant to be over-the-top when it was already doing a subtly good job.Dan Stevens is very good in the main role. From the trailer, it looked like it would be a rip-off of Nicolas Winding Refn's 'Drive' but Stevens adds a very unique coldness to his powerful persona."
" Very predictable, but quite enjoyable
",2017-02-28 00:00:00,6,"I had been wanting to watch this movie because of all of the good reviews... and I'm a little disappointed. I was expecting something fresh like ""It Follows"" (which I agree is not perfect but I think it was very entertaining, pretty creepy and the overall idea was very original). Instead, we get this recycled, very predictable story with lots of plot holes and lots of guns. I have nothing special to say about the story but I have to admit, what made me want to watch the movie 'til the end was Dan Stevens' performance. The guy can act. The music was also good. But sadly, that was it."
" Legend.
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,10,"Love this movie so much. Dan Stevens puts in a fantastic performance as David. Honestly this movie is worth a ten just for his character but the rest of the cast put in great performances and it's an entertaining movie throughout.Love the main man David though.I'm not going to spoil any of the movie as its worth watching and enjoying it yourself. Although it does get a bit predictable for the last 20 minutes or so, that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. David is such a bad ass too. All in all, it's an incredibly entertaining movie full of action and a memorable character."
