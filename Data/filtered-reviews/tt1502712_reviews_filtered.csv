" Lacks creativity
",2021-04-04 00:00:00,6,"It's very predictable. They missed an opportunity to really showcase these characters in another light, one we haven't seen before. That being said, I did enjoy this movie, it's oddly relaxing."
" Marvel Dream Crusher
",2021-04-02 00:00:00,1,This movie was just a catastrophe for Marvel fans who love the Fantastic Four... Make no mistake the Fantastic Four are my absolute favorite superheroes personally & this movie breaks my heart talk about a terrible developed Dr Doom story & then so poor budget they couldn't even give The Thing Pants & the only thing good about it was Micheal B Jordan. Oh Worst of all STAN LEE Doesn't even make a cameo SO TERRIBLE.
" Nothing really happened in this movie.
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,2,"They go to another dimention, they get their powers, then Doctor Doom shows up, they fight him and it's over. There's practically nothing else.We never see them learn to use their powers, we never see them getting to know each other, we rarely see the four together for most of the movie. All of that is skipped. We're told it happened, but we never see it, only glimpses of it in the backround.There's some good scenes. The cast is good. The effects are good. It is composed of scenes that belong in a good movie, but lacks all of the esential pieces to make it a good movie. The end result is just really bland and boring. It's not even worth getting mad about; It's just kinda sad."
" Fox and Sony execs need to let the real talent control the films
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,1,"Once again, the clowns behind the desks made all the decisions without reading a single word of the origin material and made another abomination. 3 movies and they didn't learn anything and now the franchise is probably ruined beyond repair. Don't think Marvel can even get the sour taste out of our mouths."
" Too bad it was too bad!
",2021-03-30 00:00:00,5,"Up to the point where they return from the other planet with a blast, from that point on, it's all downhill from there! That one year apart from each other was ridiculous. What was he doing in Mexico for a year, just looking Thing up in the internet? What for? There was no explanation about that at all. Plus, no character development whatsoever, for none of them. The only thing that kept me interested was the planet in that other dimension! And even that, there was no explanation about it at all! The acting was mostly good, though. And even liked the ideia of having their story told differently. Too bad it was too bad!"
" Disgustingly terrible.
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,1,"I can't express how much of a disaster this reboot is. They've changed so much from the original concept of the fantastic four within this embarrassment of a film. One indivual that participates in the demise of the film is Josh Trank, his direction/writing ethic is not as entertaining as the 2005 film nor is Kate Mara's awkward acting. Kate Mara shouldn't act, terrible performance. Josh, Changing the character's original story from the comics is just a disaster move. Why? Why would you? They're original story is what made the Fantastic Four such a great read in the comics, I just can't believe he changed the way they got there abilities, the storyline. Devastating move Josh. Avoid, Avoid, Avoid!"
" It wasn't bad!
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,8,"I don't understand the bad critics. I liked that movie. It was funny and exciting.Yes, Dr. Doom did look like a cat animated it but the rest of the film is pretty good!"
" Weak script
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,1,"The script is so boring. The idea was interesting, but the direction was pathetic. They just wasted done wonderful graphics."
" Hitchcock and Kubrick rolled over in their graves for this one
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,1,"All things considered, maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. Don't waste your time. So bad it's not even worth watching. Some bad movies are funny to watch because they're so bad, but this edition of fantastic four is so bad that it's way beyond that point. A truly excruciating 1hr 47min."
" Terrible
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,1,"Overall, this was disappointing. It was 5/6 done, and I thought I had just hit the half point. Awesome special effects, terribly done otherwise."
" Rushed mess
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,3,"Fantastic Four is a rushed mess, easily one of the worst comic book films ever made. The reshoots are glaringly obvious. The CG is consistently inconsistent. The plot is extremely unoriginal and full of plot holes. It completely wastes an extremely talented cast, giving them nothing memorable or impactful. However, it is laughably bad and the rushed nature means it's mercifully short. The music by Marco Beltrami and Philip Glass is good."
" Don't know what the hate is all about
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,9,I looked at all the hate before I watched this movies the I watched it and was like this movie is hella good man then I thought what are those hatin all about like
" Ummm......
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,2,"I'm not really sure what angle they tried to take with this ""remake"" but it fell very flat. Something about this remake didn't connect with me. I watched it for the sake of watching it but it really did not live up to its expectations"
" Blatant racism and bad storyline
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,1,"I know I probably should have realized that Kate Mara (Sue Storm) and Michael B Jordan (Johnny Storm) were going to play siblings for this film, but I didn't really think about the implications until I started watching the movie. The fact that the producers of this film decided they wanted a hunky black actor like Michael B Jordan but then decided that they didn't want a black lead actress really left me feeling disgusted. Why wouldn't you make the whole family black if the father and son were both black actors? Also when they threw in that one second ""I'm adopted"" line to explain it all away and without any other backstory for why Sue would be adopted really highlighted the fact that the producers just wanted a white actress in the lead role.I should have stopped watching there but decided to keep going because I was interested in this new storyline about how the Fantastic Four became who they are and how they got their powers. However, this new backstory just didn't add up. It was dumb that Sue got powers even though she didn't go to the other dimension and in the end Doom comes back with a vengeance to destroy the world for no reason and then after a five minute fight scene all is good and the movie is over."
" May be the worst film ever
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,1,DANGER! DANGER! BIOHAZARD AHEAD! MAY INCLUDE A LOAD OF SMELLY GARBAGE CONSISTING OF FANT4STIC. DO NOT COME ANY CLOSER....
" Flat and Uninteresting
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,2,"The visual effects were the only reason I gave two stars instead of one. The characters are flat and have no development, and the plot line is even worse. Some movies get bad ratings and they're tolerable, but this movie was just terrible, nothing fantastic about it."
" There was no 0 star
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,1,"Honestly read like 3 reviews and you'll know how bad this film isThe heroes don't get there powers until like 20 minutes away from the end
And the big finale is horrendous"
" Fantastic Four 2015 Review
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,1,"I no longer have any brain activity or any inkling of life left in my body. That's also how everybody in this film probably felt, there is absolutely no sense of emotion, or even the slightest hint that the actors / actresses even wanted to be there. The whole film feels lifeless. The last 30 minutes were extremely rushed and felt like it only happened because they had no idea what to do with this story. The characters are a total bore, the casting is terrible, the score feels almost nonexistent it's so dull, the visuals are confusing and at times off-putting, and the script is horrendous. Everything in this movie is just bad. Save yourself some time and skip this film entirely."
" Worst CBM ever
",2021-02-06 00:00:00,1,"The only thing I can say is this feels like the product of a studio mess, mixed with a rushed job for a studio to keep the rights. The reshoots you can tell based on the awful wig they have Kate Mara to wear, are inconsistent and seemed like they were shoehorned in to try and lead to place that seems like it's non existent"
" I fall asleep while watching
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,1,This is what happens when you create a movie with 4 bucks
" Clear your mind of negative reviews and you'll have a good time.
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,6,Movie wasn't even bad. Not a masterpiece but nothing wrong with it in particular. The crappy later Transformer films have better ratings than this and they were absolute trash. This film is DEFINITELY not that bad.
" Jon Favreau you are our only Hope
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,1,It can not get any worse if Jon Favreau takes the helm. With all the resources from Disney we may see a much better Fantastic Four. there are rumors that Deadpool will be filming with the Fantastic Four. We will have to see because I for one can not wait for the XMEN reboots.
" At least it tried to be a little different than the MCU
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,5,"This movie fits in more with DCEU than it does the MCU. It has the same sort of grimdark, grounded tone as the DCEU and it tries to update the comics to be more now. (Space stuff is switched to alternative dimension stuff). The resulting film feels quite different from most Marvel properties and there's even a couple of effective sequences of bodily horror. Yet it does not work as a film-Miles Teller isn't particularly suited to Reed and he doesn't have chemistry with any other actor. Bell, Jordan and Mara are generally better but everyone is pretty lackadaisical. The film is just *off* in such a fundamental way that it is not engaging. The 2005 version of the story was better but this was more daring in way."
" A reprehensibly bad reboot.
",2021-01-21 00:00:00,3,"For a movie with ""fantastic"" in its title, it's anything but. It's difficult to make a movie that's worse than the original that was released a decade earlier, but here we are. I understand the need to reboot a franchise so the owners of the rights can continue to hold onto those rights, but this is just a sad excuse for a movie. I only hope-now that Disney owns this franchise-that the next reboot of the Fantastic Four doesn't spend any time on its origin story (which we've seen twice now).While the casting for the main characters was technically proficient, if not a little young, I was stunned to see such wooden and emotionless acting from absolutely every actor on the screen. If I didn't know any better, they replaced these actors with CGI robots who state their lines instead of, you know, acting. Additionally, there didn't seem to be any stakes in this film for the main characters to have any reason to do what they did. Things just happened, and they were merely in the right place at the wrong time.It was also surprising how obvious the CGI was. Certain scenes stuck out as clearly CGI, even if they didn't have to be. Let's not even get into the ""look"" of Doctor Doom (Toby Kebbell). Sure, it had its moments, like the look of Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell), but overall it pulled me out of the story. Of course, I glanced at the clock and found that two-thirds of the film had passed before anything even remotely resembling a conflict emerged. Knowing full well who the villain would be, I had no idea what his motivation was right up until he stated it (basically straight to the camera). Overall, save yourself 100 minutes and don't ever watch this film.A reprehensibly bad reboot, I give Fantastic Four 1.5 stars out of 5."
" Here we go again
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,8,"Have to say in all honesty I preferred this version to the first I just wish one had come outfit as it suffers from a repetition syndrome that has affected so many before ie Spiderman
.i can forgive a change in cast members but this habit of literally doing a film again is bloody annoying.
Generally tho this was a good version, the way all the 4 attained their powers in my opinion was better done, although the storyline was a bit repetitive. All in all worth a watch"
" Tragic
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,2,"Possibly the worst superhero movie ever. Cheap looking effects, a pretty awful script and what did they do to Dr Doom!Really, really dull too which is unforgivable.Two stars but I rounded up.Watch logan or thor ragnarok instead...."
" Okay Okay
",2021-01-08 00:00:00,6,"In the start the movie was nice and interesting, I really liked the concept but as the movie approached the second half, it seemed as if writer had a deadline and he just finished the movie one day before it, just for the sake of it. Many things in the movie do not make sense and that makes it boring.
It's okay to just watch and forget about it."
" The Second Time Is Worse Than The First
",2020-12-30 00:00:00,5,"I decided to watch this 2015 remake of the first bad 2005 Jessica Alba Marvel film 'Fantastic Four' and although it was interesting at the beginning, whoever scripted this really didn't get it right either. I liked Kate Mara as Susan Storm as she is a much stronger character actress than Jessica Alba who's a really awful actress. I prefer Mara. Also, actor Reg Cathey and Tim Blake Nelson, who plays Mole Man, are great! Overall, the adventure and the plot were ok, but many of the scenes didn't make sense and their friend Victor who fell into a lava type substance on the planet in the beginning of the movie, survived to become Dr. Doom, as it wasn't really explained. The 'Dr. Strange' type thing that he did to planet earth was pretty cool, but there was no rhyme or reason why he became evil and why he wanted to destroy earth wasn't known. The ending regarding the new research laboratory is where they came up with their name and apparently the new facility the F4 will be working from is not on any 'government books'. To tell you the truth, it was an enjoyable film, but Rotten Tomatoes gave this a 37%, but I think a 5/10 is a good rating. Some Marvel films are terrible, but why remake the Alba Fantastic 4, only to make it worse than the first?"
" Quite a mess for many reasons
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,2,"As this remake was released in 2015 it received instant backlash and criticism by fans claiming it as one of the worst superhero films of all time (if not the worst). Finally getting around to seeing the film and can now understand the hate.The story feels rushed and dragged along while the pacing starts off as relatively slow them towards the end things wrap up quickly. It seems as if there was much editing and scenes cut involved.There isn't much action scenes and the film is quite depressing and just not fun. The original 2005 and its 2007 sequel had a light comedy aspect which made it entertaining- although those weren't necessarily great, both those films were better than this remake, as they didn't take themselves too serious.Another reason is that the villain is brought up until very late and with no build up or establishment and the fight scene did not last long. It was also quite predictable. Then the film just ends abruptly as it was clear a sequel was intended.Perhaps Fantastic Four isn't the worst superhero film but given its budget and the time it was released (during the golden age of superhero films) it is most definitely a big disappointment."
" a pleasant surprise.
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,7,"I found the movie that everyone calls the worst they have ever watched. i was drawn to watch it because of all the bad reviews it got from users. which by the way are the reviews which i find agree with my likes and dislikes the most. but this one is the exception. i kept waiting for it to fall apart, but it didn't to my surprise. it is a good addition to the marvel movie collection as far as i'm concerned, and i recommended it with confidence."
" Boring!
",2020-12-04 00:00:00,2,"Watched the movie a while ago, I'm still waiting for the 'epic fight' scene."
" People are too hard on this film
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,7,"Okay, it may not be as tight a movie as Joker, Avengers Endgame or Nolan's Batman but it's pretty good. Give it a shot, it's enjoyable and fun."
" Horrendous
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,1,Calling this movie horrendous is being generous. I saw it on an airplane for free and I still felt ripped off.
" 0 for 3
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,1,"Even grading on the superhero movie curve, this is one big, dumb, clichéd $120 million mess.Recommendation to avoid if you have a functioning brain and sense of humour.For those keeping score at home, this is strike three for Fox at attempting to make a decent Fantastic Four film."
" Better Then Expected!
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,7,"I looked at the reviews and I expected a horrific movie but instead it was anot entertaining super hero movie, better than all the previous versions for sure.
To everyone that gives this movie a 1 I am guessing you don't understand the rating system as you are ranking this among the worst movies ever made! If anyone is a fan of movies in general this is clearly not bad at all!"
" It's a decent idea
",2020-10-14 00:00:00,6,"I think the problem is that they started with it being about the 2 friends.That completely was lost. It's basically a waste of 30 minutes.It doesn't play into the movie much at all, except as a ploy. I was already skeptical of the friendship at the junk yard. But it could have been done with good writing.And if it had been, then please introduce the antagonist at this point. You would have a triad, and it would work. And it would make more sense and tension in the movie.From the notes I read, the movie was much longer initially, so maybe Trask incorporated what I'm suggesting -- I doubt it.It's okay for 5th grade."
" Not good
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,5,"I thought the first one was bad but this one is the worst. I gave it a 5 for good casts, visual and sound effects."
" yes
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,10,Good burger fries movie good yum best movie good watch doom burgers
" Grimm and Doomed World Building
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,2,"That this ""Fantastic Four"" reboot is darkly lit and otherwise grim in tone doesn't bother me too much, nor does the reported unfaithfulness to the comics, which I wouldn't be aware of if not told. I can even overlook re-shoot wigs. But, it's severely flawed in every other way, too. A lot of time is spent on silly science-y stuff, while the characters remain ill-defined beyond typical movie relationship shorthand: the loyalty between brother, sister and father; the love triangle between two scientists for the girl; and the childhood friendship from two broken homes. Then, there's the exploitation of the youngsters, from being sold on an education as they, instead, work in a laboratory for a profit-seeking institution, to basically being enslaved by the military. The movie does nothing to resolve the incongruity of its team planting the American flag on another planet while they bemoan the military industrial complex on their own Earth. Instead, we get an origins story that's blatantly formulaic in the studio's pursuit to make a (as we now know, failed) franchise out of it.The big problem isn't that the movie is ridiculously vague about what is dooming the Earth or how imminent it is in the movie, nor that Dr. Doom sets out to build a world that is even grimmer than that of the movie's Earth. No, it's that the world the makers of the movie set out to build is as hollow and exploitative as the institutions within the movie that the youngsters butt their heads against. Perhaps, if the filmmaking team realized how hypocritical this picture is, it wouldn't have turned out so dull. There's nothing fantastic about this."
" I LITERALLY WATCHED THIS ON A PLANE THEN WALKED OUT
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,1,"It was December and I didn't go to the theaters to see Fant4tic in the summer and I'm glad I didn't waste eleven bucks on it but I wasted 90 minutes of my life. The acting was awful the characterization was like Suicide Squad but way less entertaining (I'm not saying Suicide Squad was good movie but its Oscar grade in comparison to this film). It had some really awful CGI and visuals made it feel like 120,000,000 wasted on college project level movie work. The cinematography was non existent I've seen films from the 70s shot better than this. This film failed in every regard and when I watched it it was and still is one of the twenty worst films ever. This film makes the early 2000's Fantastic Four movies look like The Godfather and it's sequel."
" NOT A MARVEL MOVIE! THIS IS THE WORK OF 20TH CENTURY FOX.
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,4,"So to clear a few things up so haters can direct their hatred to the real culprits.
""Constantin films"" are the company that own the movie rights to the Fantastic four, they made both the previous Fantastic Four movies, with each movie being released through 20th Century Fox, the parent company, Marvel Studios only had a small consultancy role in all 3 movies which is also the same with all Marvel properties whose cinematic & TV rights are held by other company's.
This particular movie was a ""rush job"" with Constantin Films only having 28 days left in which to have the movie finished & released before the rights were legally returned to Marvel Studios.
So just to be clear, this movie is a Constantin Films/20th Century Fox release NOT a Marvel Studios release.
Unfortunately with a lack of decent writing talent the producers chose to do a reboot of their 2005 movie, big mistake, poor casting choices & lacklustre script together with low budget cgi saw the movie barely break even with its $100 million dollar budget & fall short of the box office takings of both previous movies in 2005 & 2007.
Changing the characters was a big risk & a bad mistake, choosing to use a darker retelling of the origin rather than using a new story was a bad mistake, something Sony has learned from with Spiderman, omitting the superhero aspect of the Fantastic Four was a huge mistake, all in all its a watchable film for a straight to video release or a sci-fi channel movie but its full of bad choices & ultimately its a huge mistake.
Hopefully once Marvel make room for it in the MCU they will do justice to The Fantastic Four."
" So boring.
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,1,"Trash, boring, garbage movie. Never watch this, I hated every second of this."
" Fantastic fall
",2020-08-30 00:00:00,3,Good solid movie until they get their powers. Everything goes wrong from there.
" Different and suprising!
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,7,It's a darker version of the comic books than expected. Not a great movie but still good to watch.
" Oh my god
",2020-08-02 00:00:00,2,I couldn't finish the movie it was so boring. Now I have watched some crappie super hero movies but this is the worst. This is a great movie to watch if your are studying.
" Another useless reboot attempt
",2020-08-01 00:00:00,2,"This was good enough to actually finish watching, and the characters were okay, but it was nowhere near as good as the original.
This was just another failed reboot attempt that shouldn't have bothered."
" Not as bad as expected
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,5,"So, I sat down to watch this a mere 3 years post release. I expected to watch something truly awful, having read much about Trank and this so called abomination.Would I found was a real mixed bag, and I can't help but wonder how this might have turned out if the studio had left Trank to his own devices.I personally liked the dark tone, and while its pretty much impossible to know how much of this was within the original vision... i thought it played ot like a decent movie until around 70% through.As an origin story I thought it worked... right up until Victor came back. As soon as Victor came back the entire tone changed and the whole banding together to fight felt forced, unexciting and cheesy.Looking through the reviews here I can see I'm in the minority... but another 30 mins and a slower burner in the third act might have done this the world of good.Missed opportunity full of unfulfilled promise."
" A bad film
",2020-07-27 00:00:00,3,"Three stars for special affects, the ""Fantastic Four"" made five years or so earlier was much better imo."
" Possibly the worst superhero film ever.
",2020-07-21 00:00:00,1,"EV ER
My 8-year-old son couldn't even stand it.
I can't understand how people in charge of a movie can make something like this, look at the results and say, 'yeah, let's go with this'. They should do themselves a favour and hide their shameful messes instead of releasing them in theatres.
Disgraceful. A blight on the career of everyone involved."
" Well, it's bad, but not THAT bad.
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,3,"This is a disappointing movie, and there's no way around that. Given the talent and the budget involved, a much better movie should have been made. But every review I've seen has told me it's horrible, and it's really not. It isn't good; don't mistake me. It's predictable and it doesn't reward close attention. But the story line (while far-fetched) is coherent. The characters are consistent, even though they lack depth. The effects are unimpressive, but please recall that we are spoiled these days with stunning visual effects. The effects are unimpressive but not embarrassingly so.We have been spoiled by the MCU; there's a high bar for superhero movies that this doesn't clear. This movie killed an hour and forty minutes of my life, and I remember many, many movies that have been less pleasant than this one. Would I recommend it? No. But I didn't entirely hate it, either. If I had paid for this movie, I would probably review it differently, but it was included in my Disney Plus. If you too can watch it for free, you might find worse ways to kill some time."
" Honestly don't understand why people hate this movie
",2020-07-20 00:00:00,10,"I came across this movie tonight with my parents. We started watching and were immediately hooked. The cast is fantastic (no pun intended), the movie is exceptionally made and the story line, although it deviates slightly from the comics, keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The character development in this film is next level - we couldn't help but sympathize with the new heroes as they ""worked"" for the government with the hope of finding a cure for their mutations. I mean, can you believe the government did that to them!? Now let's talk about Dr. Doom - man, he's pure evil! What a great villain. At first we thought there was no way the Fantastic Four would be able to stop him, but were literally cheering out loud when the new superheroes banded together to defeat that monster from destroying Earth. What a thrill. Such a great ending... Afterwards I went on to IMDB to check out the film details and couldnt believe the reviews for this movie! I honestly don't get it. This is hands down one of the best movies me and my parents have ever seen, and FYI - we watch a lot of movies. In other words, don't believe every review you read! Thanks Marvel for this remake, it was such a treat."
" Far From Perfect but Not Nearly as Bad as You've Heard
",2020-07-13 00:00:00,6,"I truly believe that if no one had ever heard of the Fantastic Four, this would've been a success. Like are you telling me you didn't think the first half of this movie was intriguing at all? Because I think everyone was really enjoying this movie until they botched the last half of it. Majority of the hate is from people trying to trend and over exaggerating. If I had to compare this to anything, I think it closely resembles the structure of Batman V Superman. It's full of well directed and scripted scenes in the first acts but leaves something to be desired as it progresses. This is the result of trying to build a group of characters from the ground up, and then forcing in a conflict capable of being in an entirely separate movie. For Batman V Superman, it was Doomsday. For Fantastic Four, it was Dr. Doom. I really don't think it was enough to ruin the movie. It just keeps it from being perfect. Audiences are so quick to jump to trends. Like in B. V. S., everyone was hating on that movie for the first few weeks of its release, then all of the sudden, the merchandise sells out like crazy and everyone boards the trend of Ben Affleck's Batman being the greatest. It's the same thing with Fantastic Four. It was given hate during its initial release except it never got bigger given it's relevancy to the MCU died instantaneously being as it was Sony rather than Disney where as Batman V Superman was a starter for the Justice League universe. Also the Fantastic Four isn't nearly as popular as Batman or Superman despite being extremely well known.Without a doubt, this certainly had a darker tone than the previous Fantastic Four films and even the comics. Personally I liked the changes they made. The Thing and The Human Torch working as government assassins made them more interesting in my opinion. Same with Susan and Johnny being able to do hands on work with Reed Richards. It adds more to their personalities and gives them more to do then just following Mr. Fantastic and adding comic relief when need be. It just works better with a more modern audience.I think you should give this a shot if you found this movie even moderately intriguing. It's not a complete train reck like the critics are making it out to be. Also the MCU definitely stole Thing's design for Korg in Thor. Both Korg and Thing are designed differently in the comics but the MCU straight up took the Sony Thing's design. I don't know why no one mentions this."
" FANTASTIC FLOP
",2020-07-09 00:00:00,1,"What a waste of money and CGI. Awful plot, zero character development, no chemistry between characters, zero humour, stupid stupid script. Don't waste your time!"
" A huge disappointment that had a massive amount of potential...
",2020-07-06 00:00:00,1,"When I first saw the trailer, I was extremely excited. The Fantastic Four is possibly my favorite comic book superheroes. The ones released in the early 2000's were.........meh. They had some ok moments, but those movies just weren't that good. So, I was so excited to see the movie. When I finally watched it, my excitement for it completely went away. The trailers for it were so good. The movie however, was not. The movie was absolutely terrible. Most of the damn scenes in the trailers weren't even in the movie. The main villain didn't have that much screen time, the humor in the movie wasn't even funny, and the acting was......meh, the characters weren't even that likable. They even asked Stan
Lee to do a cameo in this movie. I'm glad he refused to be in this pile of crap. For me, the good things in this movie was the soundtrack, and CGI. The soundtrack is pretty good, and the CGI is at least decent. But overall, this movie had so much potential, but it was such a massive disappointment. Truly one of the worst superhero movies I've ever seen in my entire life. I don't recommend this movie to anyone at all!"
" Boring, creepy, then boring again
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,1,"No humor, unlikeable characters, takes forever to get somewhere in the storyline. It gets creepy and dark."
" A Disgrace!
",2020-07-04 00:00:00,1,"Of all the comic book movies ever made, this was by far the most embarrassing. Stan Lee himself refused to appear in it, and he was the original creator. You don't even have to be a fan or familiar with the story to see all the obvious flaws. For the F4 fans, it wasn't even close to the same story. Casting wasn't thought through, the plot was too thin too often, and overall continuity was practically nonexistent. Any comic book fan can tell you what their least favorite superhero film was, but this one was just too horrible to make the ""worst"" list.
Michael B. Jordan survived it, while everyone else should pretend they had nothing to do with making it."
" Thank goodness I didn't subscribe to Disney + just for this title!
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,2,One of the worst superhero boss battles ever...the closing credits lasted longer than the battle with Dr. Doom.
" Wow. These reviews are bogus. Don't listen watch for yourself
",2020-06-28 00:00:00,7,"First I want to say I read reviews and I skipped watching this movie while ago. But recently I watched it thinking let me see how bad it is like how these people saying it is. I must say it's no where near as bad as these 1 star people making out it to be. It's good origin story. Definitely a new take on the comic characters and their background. It's thoroughly enjoyable from the beginning to the end. My guess is all these bad reviews must have been paid Disney since they wanted to buy the rights of fantastic 4.
Watch this movie for yourself and I guarantee you won't be disappointed. This is definitely better than few of the marvel movies that came out."
" Who?
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,5,"There's an okay movie in here somewhere, but not sure what the hell it has to do with the Fantastic Four."
" Anti Climatic with a bad ending

" Why make this movie?
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,1,"Started out with promise but it took way too long for the heroes to get their powers. Once they did, the movie ended. I looked at reviews before I watched but I still had some hope going into it. Mainly because I am a big marvel fan so I didn't want to give in to the criticisms. Very disappointed in the movie. There was hardly any action and the actors chosen for the film did not fit their roles well at all. I wish someone will save this franchise like they did Spider-Man because I feel the fantastic four has a lot of potential in the current marvel era."
" 4.3 is an overrated score
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,1,"The first 30 minutes, me: It wasn't as bad as the reviews claimed
After they went to another dimension: Oh so this is why the low score? I think it still worth 5/10
Everything after they came back from another dimension: Whoever reviewed that gave more than 1/10 sure as hell didn't finish the movie.P/S: I paused the movie with 30 minutes left just to login and leave this review."
" It's Clobber Time!

" Meh
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,5,"I don't think the movie was horrible as a whole. If I judge it as straight sci-fi, it's not that bad of a movie, the ending notwithstanding. Unfortunately, because I am at least a little familiar with the source material, it just didn't work for me.
I thought the production quality and acting performances were mostly good. Unfortunately, the story itself is the weakness here. The buildup is long and drawn out. By the time the protagonists got their powers and the action was supposed to start, it felt like the director was like, ""OK, we gotta wrap this up.""
Reid Richards's brief disappearance from the group had no bearing on the rest of the story. All four of them could've been exploring their abilities and going on missions to build their chemistry by the time Dr. Doom appeared. It would've filled the story with more action sequences, which were sorely lacking."
" No Cursing No Homo's Better then ST Discovery
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,7,My wife and I enjoyed this version very much. Nothing thrown in our faces like Star Trek Discovery. This was a nice Science Fiction change.
" Not terrible,, just not really good either,,
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,5,"This movie would've been just fine if it had not been the F4 characters in a movie called F4. Seriously,,, if they'd not done that it would've been,, well not a hit,, but
moderately successful.I like the cast. They were much more serious in manner and interaction than the previous F4 movies/cast. I also like what they did with Doom,, he wasn't messing around.I don't like how the movie is a lot of set up. Granted,, plenty of movies don't set up enough,, but too much set up isn't good either. There were a few scenes where the acting was fairly laughable. The writing may be to blame,, but it was bad (and we know the actors can act - Jordan in everything,, Teller in Bleed for this,, Mara in AHS,, Bell in Skin). I don't like the time jump in the middle. Overall I'd give the movie a 5.5,,,Hopefully, when the MCU introduces the F4 into their world,, things go a lot better,,,"
" Worst Marvel movie ever!!!
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,1,"Generally, all Marvel movies are bad but still i like them because i am a big Marvel fan, but this is the worst of the worst!!! Except the names, everything is wrong and has nothing to do with the Marvel facts. If you love Marvel comics or Marvel facts, avoid this pls or you might smash your TV or whatever device you may watch it on."
" Terrible in Every Regard
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,1,"The reviews speak for themselves. All around dreadful. I'm struggling to think of a worse comic book film, so Ryan Reynolds can rest easy, because this movie makes Green Lantern look like a cinematic masterpiece. It almost seems as if it was tailor made for Mystery Science Theater 3000. I just can't believe how bad it is. Someone read that screenplay and think ""Yeah, this is it, Chief."" How? Terrible music. Terrible plot. Just terrible everything. I like Michael B Jordan and Kate Mara a lot, but even they couldn't rescue this movie from itself."
" I thought it was FANTASTIC !
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,8,"Some of these reviewers are using their emotion instead of their logical thinking. I think it was very good... wish it was longer and have another sequel of some sort, maybe a TV Series. It might cost more because of all the special effects required to make TV Series. And maybe just good for one season since it is kinda hard to find good stories for this team. Overall this movie is great."
" Fox fails Fantastic Four for fourth feature (first was 1992)
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,6,"Weak watch, probably won't watch again, and can't recommend.Let's be upfront, I've never been a fan of the Fantastic Four, but I respect their place in Marvel comics.I was really bored until they started to Fantastic Four. They spend way too much on establishing nothing, making weird changes to the Storms and Doom, and giving Richards the Spiderman treatment: his thing is that he's literally in the top ten smartest Terrans, but it's more important that he's young.They actually giving us a more interesting (not hard) origin story, and then went right back to (explicitive deleted) it up again, changing Sue's powers so they don't need the Fantastic Four flying car, and turning them into a military asset instead of a scientific research team. They even took Ben's mechanic abilities away.They also dehumanize Doom, completing changing who he is, his powers, his motivations, and even his classic look: which cosplayers have shown works in real life, they just had to tweak it.I'll maintain, pre-disney, there hasn't been a good F4 movie. Eventually we'll see them get introduced to the MCU in some movie, they'll probably buy Stark Tower because the MCU is too broken to have two special towers at the same time."
" What is with ppl slating this movie!?
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,8,"Before I start I want to mention I've never seen or read anything about fantastic 4 so for me this film is stand alone, I can only base it on what I seen and enjoyed about this movie.Thoroughly enjoyable, good story line, realistic and believable acting, great characters.I've watched this film at least 6 times and keep going back to it because it's believable!Go in with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is, a decent, well put together movie. Disappointed there's no follow up but that's prob due to all the negativity (yawn thanks for spoiling it ppl)"
" F.a.N.T.4.S.t.I.c Fo.U.r
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,2,"Finishing this movie is not for the faint of heart.
Almost made me hate the invention of film.
No heart or soul in the movie.
The tone and pace is all over the place.
4 classic characters ruined.
Sometimes it's best to give up on a franchise.
The beginning of the end for Twentieth Century Fox.
Imagine a movie that doesn't know why it exists.
Cinema was better off before this movie existed.
Feel bad for those who saw this in theaters.
Opposite of a good time.
Unlikely to ever be watched a second time.
Raises the bar in one thing: Terrible Movies."
" It's as flat as a crêpe that's been run over by a steam roller... twice!
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,5,"It'd have to be a pretty bad film for me to think it was worse than anything featuring Ioan Gruffudd, but ten years after that attempt - this 2015 version of the Marvel franchise is as bad as they get. Michael B. Jordan is in a class of his own as ""Johnny Storm"" (admittedly, the best character from this rather limited choice) but the remainder of the team deliver a performance totally devoid of humour - there is simply no fun to be had in this dark, dreary telling of the four youngsters who are involved in an accident on a parallel world that leaves them with some rather interesting quirks. Soon everyone is trying to cash in on their skills - from science to the military - until their erstwhile colleague ""Victor von Doom"" (Toby Kebbell) arrives determined to seek his revenge for them leaving him behind... The effects are great, colourful and professional but that's about the height of it - Miles Teller and Kate Mara have no chemistry at all and Jamie Bell's appearances aren't long enough before he turns to stone to merit much comment either. Maybe the 2025 version will be better..."
" Bruuutal
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,1,"Kept waiting for it to get good. Nothing happens.
Would give it a zero if I could. Casting doesn't make sense and the story line is confusing too. Just super super boring."
" Better than I expected, but not by much
",2020-05-28 00:00:00,5,"Back in 2015, I saw a huge cardboard display for the new Fantastic Four movie, and I thought, ""Oh no, is this gonna be one of those movies where it's coated in that ugly desaturated earth and metal tones?"" So, I didn't watch it because I wasn't into Marvel movies in general, but it might be a critical success regardless. However, this movie describing the origins of the team, which includes Mr. Fantastic (Miles Teller), Invisible Girl (Kate Mara), Human Torch (Michael B. Jordan) and Thing (Jamie Bell), and their plot to defeat the evil Dr. Doom (Toby Kebell) had been critically thrashed, warranting a 5% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Well, after seeing this, part of me can see why, but on the other hand, on the other perspective, it's not exactly worthy of a low rating. The story splits into two segments: Reed Richards building the dimensional transporter and the four superheroes fighting Von Doom. Although the story takes itself way too seriously, most of the movie is shot in the dark, and the most of the action happens in the background, Josh Trank's Fantastic Four is competent on visual effects, the musical score by Marco Beltrami and Philip Glass, and the performances by Teller, Mara, Jordan and Bell. Most of the faults in the movie come from producer and co-writer Simon Kinberg, who wanted to capitalize on the success on The Avengers and X-Men and make a realistic version of Jack Kirby and Stan Lee's story. His obsession with dimming the lights and desaturating every scene makes a chuck of the movie unwatchable and drab. On top of everything else, Trank tweeted that he wanted to be faithful to the source material except with a body count, resulting in a drastic tug of war game between him and Marvel. Despite the messy storyline and blatant studio intervention, Fantastic Four wasn't a good movie, but I'm glad I saw it. (2 ½ Black Hole Sky Portals out of 5)"
" Disappointment
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,3,I liked the earlier films better. The film lacked suspense and sympathy for the actors.
" Took me 5 years to watch
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,6,"Ahh idk look this movie is no means good but honestly people are abit full on, like people where poorly casted and some of the special effects are pretty odd and the story drags on abit but honestly rather watch this then most MCU films... some of the lines are kinda cheesey and it's odd since they go from being kinda dark to these weird jokes put in.. idk look it's not something I'm going to watch again but to pretty much slam josh frank for this movie isn't fair the studio could of made changes but oh we'll definitely not getting a sequel like they thought haha"
" #releasethetrankcut
",2020-05-11 00:00:00,6,"I loved chronical and can't help but think the studio completely screwed this movie up, he has a very different take on it and they let him make it. Once they realized what it was they started meddling and this is what you get . Don't hire a director if all the producers think they know better."
" Nothing to say
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,1,"There really isn't anything to say about this film... I can only assume that serious issues happened behind the scenes! They had decent actors and a very good budget; it should have been ""fine""... but it is quite possibly the worst superhero movie ever made! And in a world where ""Suicide Squad"" exists, that is a bold claim to fame!"
" The lack of agility, the lack of rhythm, the lack of action and the anticlimax of the last act harm the film as a whole and confirm the tense atmosphere behind the production
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,6,"Seeking to take advantage of popular characters in hand and enjoying the success of the Marvel cinematic universe, FOX launches yet another version of one of the most loved groups in the comics, the Fantastic Four. After the release of two films in 2005 and 2007 - both directed by Tim Story - that did not do so well at the box office and that generated mixed reviews from critics and audiences, the new adaptation was in charge of Josh Trank, who had debuted in the direction of a feature film shortly before with the praised Poder Sem Limites (2012), which also dealt with a group of young people with superpowers.Trank, who achieved the feat of being fired for directing one of the films derived from Star Wars (""Rogue One"") for the behavior in the filming of this new Fantastic Four, whose final product gives the exact measure of turbulent production. The expectation formed around this new version was great and the way this new version would be addressed was the big question. After the first news and images of disclosure with the new cast were being published, the questions began. Later, news emerged that the product did not please the studio and that remakes would be necessary. At this point, it was already certain that the chance of the project sinking was enormous.The film revolves around student Reed Richards (Miles Teller, from Whiplash) and his obsession with creating a teleportation machine. With the help of his best friend, Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell, from The Adventures of Tintin), he succeeds and draws the attention of scientist Franklin Storm (Reg. E. Cathey, from the House of Cards series). Along with Sue (Kate Mara, also from House of Cards) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan, from Fruitvale Station), sons of Dr. Franklin, and the rebel Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebell, from RocknRolla), Reed improves his invention and builds a portal to another dimension, a kind of planet similar to Earth in its early days.The new ""Fantastic Four"" is basically a great introduction. In this sense, some fans must approve the fact that we have more time to identify and get to know the main characters. The origin of the Fantastic Four is practically the same as that of the 2005 film, as is the villain. In fact, this time, many will regret the simplicity of the action and the plot involving the villain Dr. Destino, completely wasted. Obviously, this is an introductory film, but it can't be just that. There must be a history surrounding it that creates a threat to the group that will be formed, something that makes the audience cheer for the heroes, which this script completely fails.
This year's adaptation successfully tries to be more serious and realistic than the one from ten years ago, considered silly and childish by most fans. This, however, does not mean that the reboot is better than the previous version. Having the chance to fix mistakes from the first adaptations made for the cinema, Josh Trank misses the chance to thoroughly explore the origin of each of the four members of the group of heroes, ignored in the first adaptation. Despite the film's large number of dialogues, more minutes were spent talking about science than showing Reed's childhood.The script signed by Jeremy Slater, Simon Kinberg and Josh Trank himself makes different options than previous versions for the cinema. It brings the younger group and starting to create bonds between them. To begin with, the film begins by showing friends Reed Richards (Miles Teller) and Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) as children creating their bonds of friendship that would last into adulthood. We can already know from the beginning the problematic families in which friends live, in addition to all the genius of Reed.The option to recreate the origin of the Storm brothers caused controversy for changing Johnny's ethnicity and introducing Sue as his adopted sister / daughter. Nowadays, it seems to be mandatory to want to give representation to minorities in the cinema, even if for that, it is necessary to mischaracterize characters so well known to the comic book audience. The question remains: Is it really necessary to make these unnecessary changes that, invariably, end up displeasing the most fervent comic book fans? These are factors that do not alter the story, except for the fact that he wants to portray a black hero at any cost.Leaving aside these controversial issues, at least we can verify that the couple of brothers Susan and Johnny Storm and their relationship with their father, Dr. Franklin Storm are portrayed in a competent manner. They are still Sue's closest relationship with her father - who work together at the Baxter Foundation - for sharing the same love for science and the most conflicted relationship with Johnny's rebellious and free, who likes to venture out and get in trouble even though he also has a natural aptitude for science. When the worlds meet - and the suspicious Victor Von Doom enters the scene - the gears keep turning without effort. It is a perfectly common environment that has been established.The curious thing about this Josh Trank film is that he dedicates a lot of his time to strengthening the relationship between young scientists. If on the one hand this is good, on the other hand it ends up frustrating the public, which takes almost an hour of projection to see the heroes as the Fantastic Four. We can also see here that the greater focus on family was privileged, both in building the relationship between the members of the Quartet, led by the Storm brothers' father, Dr. Franklin. We can see that the script does not invest in the relationship between Reed and Sue, giving more focus to the Storm brothers and their father. The actor does not go wrong, but he is hampered by all possible mentor clichés. At one point, he says: ""Family means taking care of each other.""
The tone of the film after the second dimensional journey also changes. For months there were rumors about reshoots and the studio's order to have ""more Quartet"" in it and the last act seems to confirm that. There is a sudden break in the action and the ease and speed with which the group ends the villain is amazing. Neither the lives of any of the protagonists nor the planet Earth were really at risk. It gives the clear impression that the script finished everything quickly, causing no emotion. We don't even have time to start rooting for our heroes. What the end does manage to provoke is a certain disbelief in the public. Much of this is certainly due to the tight budget of $ 120 million, which also explains the low quantity, quality of effects and creativity to choreograph the action scenes. It should be noted that most of the budget was spent on heroes, damaging everything else.The impression is that the production had everything to work. With a promising director and a cast of talented young people, we were able to enjoy little. The interaction between the characters works to some extent, but the lack of agility, the lack of rhythm, the lack of action and the anticlimax of the last act harm the film as a whole and confirm the tense atmosphere behind the scenes of the production. Once again, the audience will have to wait to have a definitive version of the Fantastic Four on the big screen. The impression that FOX had to produce something to the touch of a box in order not to lose the rights to the characters, is clear."
" Don't believe the terrible ratings
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,10,I watched this without checking here on IMDB for a rating which I'm glad I did otherwise I would have definitely passed on this movie as most of the ratings are so terrible. I really enjoyed the movie but obviously with the feedback that's out there I highly doubt they will make a sequel which is disappointing. I thought it was a really good origin story that left me wanting more I guess I'll have to wait 10 years till they decide to reboot it again.
" 120 million?
",2020-04-06 00:00:00,3,"The film cost $120 million or thereabouts. It's probably the worse superhero film I've had the misfortune to see.I'm hoping beyond hopes that they really don't consider another project with the same cast and crew.Given the budget and the capability of CGI, this could have been epic.It's not. It's flawed in every way."
" Stan Lee Refused to Do a Cameo, So That's How Much it Sucks
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,2,"Saw this on E4 during the coronavirus lockdown where TV channels are frantically trying to fill their schedules with any old nonsense to keep an increasingly bored, house bound UK occupied and away from ram raiding Aldi for pesto and toilet roll.It truly is dreadful with most of the cast displaying the 'I'm not even supposed to BE here today!' sullen expression of contractual obligation as worn by Jennifer Lawrence in the equally awful 'Dark Phoenix'.From what I've read, the director behaved like a spoilt Victorian child throughout production and treated Kate Mara particularly poorly, so that explains why she looks utterly miserable throughout.It's pretty dark and angsty (eg, Kate Mara's character states she needs to listen to famed 90's Bristolian whinge-core band Portishead to focus on her work, something that I laughed out loud at) but there truly is nothing moody and serious about the Stretch Armstrong scenes - another source of unintentional humour. It would have been cool if they'd gone down the grotesque X-Files' Eugene Tooms style route of gross, greasy, sinister hypermobility.The Fantastic Four comics really deserve a high camp, fun for the family treatment, a la Guardians of the Galaxy, to do it justice, not the unhinged ramblings of a 13 year old emo trapped in the body of a director with the budget of a small country.I've read that Tommy Wiseau (The Room) expressed an interest in doing a sequel to this which sounds like it genuinely would be fantastic, heaps of demented Troma type fun and definitely something I'd pay good money to see."
" Actually good
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,8,"I knew this was a flop and saw the reviews, so expected a total bomb leaving me wanting my time back. On the contrary this wasn't bad. Yes they're kids, and they changed the whole story of their powers and lives. Accepting that, I never saw the bad part of this movie."
" Allowing Instagram to Decide What I Watch While in Isolation Day 7:
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,2,"What hurts the most about 2015's Fantastic Four reboot is that there is a seed of something at the very least interesting buried under the layers of terrible studio notes and pandering rewrites.The first 20 minutes or so aren't that bad setting up a series of likeable characters but as soon as this becomes a Fantastic Four movie it is borderline unwatchable. Blatant continuity issues, on the nose dialogue and you can practically feel the moment that Miles Teller gave up on his performance."
" Destroy at all costs!
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,1,"Dear Fox,
You've officially proved 3 times now that you can not make a good Fantastic Four movie. Just give the rights to Marvel studios already and let them control it.
How did Josh Trank go from making a great movie like ""Chronicle"", to making this? This doesn't even feel like a superhero movie. It's so boring. It's an hour and a half (without credits) and an hour and 15 minutes is spent on the so-called ""origin story"". By the time the film actually got to the action, the thrill was gone. I was out of it. I didn't care anymore, and just wanted the film to end. They messed up Dr. Doom. When did he have romantic interest in Invisible Woman? Oh, yeah. That's right. Never. And The Thing's motion capture just looks creepy. this movie makes me so angry. The Fantastic Four's powers sure would come in handy in destroying this movie, though. Mr. Fantastic can throw this movie into another dimension, Invisible Woman can make the ashamed filmmakers invisible, and put force fields around them to shield them from the rotten tomatoes I want to throw at them, Human Torch can burn all copies of this movie, and Thing can smash all copies of this movie.
Grade: F+. 0/10. 0/5 stars"
" Not Bad, But Not Better than the Original!
",2020-03-19 00:00:00,7,"I shouldn't say it wasn't better than the original. They all did pretty well in this movie.The difference was Ben being bigger in this compared to Ben from the original where he is the same size as the others.I was surprised to see Michael B Jordan in this movie! It was not better than the original, but it is still entertaining and interesting to watch."

Ben was wooden and Mr Fantastic was about 12.2005 was far better with more primitive special effects."
" Very disappointing
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,4,"Unfortunately for everyone involved and especially the audience, the creators of this reboot had no idea what the F4 stand for, or what their stories should be about. This is rather dark, without charm or humor and totally ruins one of the greatest villains of Marvel comics. sure, the special effects are decent and there is potential for a somewhat good film here or there but the stereotypes and lack of an intriguing plot entirely ruin any chance of a redeeming movie experience. Very disappointing."

" Superhero movie with less than half an hour of superhero stuff
",2020-02-15 00:00:00,5,"We begin to see the superpowers only in the last third of the movie and even then, it's quite underwhelming. Admittedly, the remake story is fresh and it had great potential but they made an utter muck of it. Plus, there is hardly any chemistry among the four friends, there is no development of each character and even the single instance of banter that Johnny the Human Torch engages in with Ben - as he used to in the original movie - occurs at the end.It makes no sense."
" Pleasantly surprised!
",2020-02-10 00:00:00,8,"I expected this to be horrible. Took me 4 years to finally get around to watching it because I read all the reviews and no-one liked it.
I appreciated its slightly darker tone. Maybe it wasn't incredible but it sure kept me involved most of the time.
The origin/back story went a long time, which I actually like in movies, but it did make the second half of the movie feel a little rushed. It wasn't a long movie so they could have put a little more in the second half after all the origin was done with.I don't want to compare it to MCU movies and amazing films like the Dark Knight trilogy, it's a stand alone film that should be credited in its own merits.
A decent to good movie.
I preferred it to the previous two F4 movies, as I found them a little childish (adventurous and still fun) but this was a different take on F4 and I personally appreciated it."

Now I don't know how it compares to the original comics; this version is much better than the 2005's, which was a bit too light hearted for me.So I say watch it."
" How is it possible for a movie to be this bad
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,1,"It's like they talked to a focus group who said that people want less setup and exposition and more action, and then some idiot read the results backwards. They had a movie, but then they realized it would be 3.5 hours long, so instead of doing the logical thing and cutting some of the exposition, they cut out the entire middle of the movie and added more exposition to compensate. Moreover, this movie is dumb because it reinforces the general consensus that the Fantastic Four are lame characters. We've only ever seen a silly, campy Fantastic Four, and this movie gives us the polar opposite of the 2005 movie. It takes itself way too seriously, and it was clearly only made so that Fox could keep the rights away from Marvel. On the other hand, this movie is a godsend for other terrible or mediocre superhero movies. Now when anyone says that Dark Phoenix and Daredevil (2003) were bad, someone else can say, ""At least they weren't as bad as FANT4STIC."""

",2019-12-07 00:00:00,2,"This was the worst marvel movie i have ever seen... Though this was not from the marvel cinematic universe, so still cudos to them. But but but, if you come to a comparison with the 10 year earlier's plot acting story telling and ofcourse all of their combination on screen, this was just a piece of s**t. I mean seriously!!! Guys?? Why? Why is the motive to make a reboot out of a comic book. And if so is your very intention then come up with something that could actually make sense... This is just a headache and nothing..."
" Studio mayhem
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,4,"The film is quite good until the second film. It starts out like Cronenberg's The Fly, building a strong foundation before going nowhere. Whatever the filmmakers vision was before the obvious reboots, that's the film I wanted to watch. Trank had a Fincher movie making experience, Fox pumped an extra 40 million on reshoots and essentially locked the filmmaker out of the editing room. Maybe we might see the director's cut in the future, maybe not, Disney now owns the film. There were strong beats here and it was not bad, but the interference was obvious and the running time was cut in half, not a great sign. The film is just a mess from cutting out and adding in."

",2019-11-25 00:00:00,1,"Just over an hour before anything exciting happens then the ending gets rushed?

" One of the worst superhero films of all-time? Pretty much.
",2019-09-18 00:00:00,1,"""Fantastic Four"" (2015), also known as ""Fant4stic"". Wow, putting numbers in place of letters in movie titles is really getting old, and this is certainly one of the worst examples of that! Any way, let's get to the review. Well, this ""movie"" sucks! Saying that this ""movie"" sucks is an understatement if there ever was one. This is the worst overall Marvel superhero film! It may not be part of the official Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise, but it's still classified as a Marvel film, unfortunately. This is one of the most boring ""movies"" I have ever seen in my life. It has the same old cliched storyline, terrible acting, underwhelming soundtrack, boring sets/locations, and also, surprisingly, for a modern ""movie"", the special effects look cheap and even a little cartoon-like! I love the first two ""Fantastic Four"" films from 2005 and 2007, and even the unreleased version from 1994! Those movies are masterpieces compared to this ""film"". It's like during production the film makers said: ""wow guys, check it out! We have full creative control of these superhero characters. How can we possibly ruin it?!"" Well, big shock, since it's modern movie times, they did. They did nothing to improve on the real storyline, the actual story is entertaining compared to this! Something else to point out is that the words ""Fantastic 4"" are not spoken at any point during the ""film"". They almost say it at the end, but the end credits show the words on the screen. Wow, even the actors were embarrassed to say ""Fantastic 4"" in this ""movie"". Talk about embracing the concept with pride! The ""acting"" is dull, boring and abysmal. Another thing to point out is: why is The Thing naked? His character is not naked in the comics, he always wears pants or some other form of clothing. Well at least in this ""movie"", we can't see his ""thing""! The rest of the cast is abysmal and completely wrong for their characters. Another thing you'll notice right away if you're unfortunate enough to view this ""film"". Almost all of it takes place in dark rooms, or other locations with hardly any lighting. Sounds exciting, right? What, did the film crew forget to pay the electric bill? Finally, the soundtrack is lazy, overproduced, boring and generic. There is nothing positive I can salvage from this ""movie"". This ""film"" should have never been made! I rate this ""movie"" 0 out of 5 stars on my scale. Ignore the 1 star rating on IMDB, if I could rate this ""film"" lower than 1 star on IMDB I would. My real rating is 0 stars! Another big shocking thing to point out is that the director of this ""movie"", Josh Trank, said, and I quote: ""A year ago I had a fantastic version of this. And it would've received great reviews. You'll probably never see it. That's reality though."" Sadly, that's the truth nowadays, money now seems to be more valuable than making entertaining movies. Also, it's a coincidence that the director's last name is Trank. That perfectly describes this ""film"", tranked! From that point, he completely disowned the film, and it's no surprise why. Even the late, but great, Stan Lee sent Josh Trank a letter asking if he was okay. Wow, there's ouch, and then there's bludgeoning to the head! Do yourself a favor, stay away from this ""movie"". Trust me, I'm saving you 100 minutes of your time! This ""film"" is anything but ""fantastic""."
" That was just upsetting.
",2019-09-17 00:00:00,2,"Well, this movie happened. Honestly I was hoping that I'd enjoy it, just because everyone hates it so much. But this is just...wow. It barely has a structure, the cinematography is so lackluster and boring, the effects range from pretty good to downright terrible, the cast is sadly misused, and the villain literally doesn't show up until there are 20 minutes left in the movie.The characters are flat and boring, to the point that Reed's offhand comment to Susan about music being ""her thing"" was actually accurate. everyone has one character trait that they're stuck to for the runtime. Reed's the nerd who doesn't have friends; Ben's the tough, angry one; Johnny's the cool badass who breaks the rules; Susan likes music and patterns; and Victor is just edgy Reed until he's evil out of nowhere 3/4 of the way through the movie because the filmmakers remembered that they needed to check the villain box for their superhero flick.While I'd recommend movies like Daredevil, Batman & Robin, and Catwoman for the ironic enjoyment, I wouldn't force my worst enemies to watch this movie. It's so dull, to the point that half the action and all the ""character development"" is talked about rather than ever shown.The dialog makes me cringe so hard. No one interacts naturally, to the point that a major character death has no real emotional weight. The whole movie is just one long series of characters saying stuff that sounds dumb.The casting was actually kind of exciting to me. I thought they all would actually do a good job with what they were given, but it's clear the on-set issues led to the actors not giving a damn. Mara and Teller aren't even close to having a tiny bit of chemistry, and Jordan and Bell are clearly phoning in their performances. Kebbell also obviously doesn't care, but he's not in a lot of the movie.The effects are passable by 2015 standards for the most part. The render on The Thing is actually pretty solid. That part was actually good. Doom doesn't look absolutely terrible (I mean his design is crap, but his effects aren't too bad). Mr. Fantastic is occasionally uncanny, but his power is stretching so that's not unexpected. The Human Torch effects are easily the worst in the movie. They look just as bad as the effects on Chris Evans from 2005.Overall, I give the movie 2/5 stars because at least the effects aren't terrible. This is also not the worst movie I've ever seen, even if it's in the running for worst superhero movie.Fingers crossed Marvel Studios will make the first really good Fantastic 4 movie."
" Fantastically stupid
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,1,"This movie is extremely, aggressively bad. The script is like from a cheap tv show from the 60's but with larger budget (which went god knows where since the movie and FX look bad too). There was nothing likable about any of the characters, with the exception Sue Storm, because she is pretty. The main heroes are stupid teenagers that somehow make teleportation devices. The main villain apparently set the laboratory on fire before they asked him to return to the project, for which he contributes exactly nothing, besides being a sulky jealous rooster-blocker, and ironically ends up again setting the laboratory on fire and even more than that. Who could've guessed. The funniest thing is this movie ends up being many times worse than the first Fantastic four movie, which was enough already. Now the question is - can Fox make a third - even more stupid version? I bet they can."
" Not too bad.
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,6,"Honestly, I enjoyed the movie. Yes, it has some flaws, and if you read other reviews, they all had very strong points, though. However, the only ""complaints"" that I had an issue with were the ones with the Human Torch being black. If you notice, the people that complained weren't familiar with comics, cartoons, other movies, etc. and that's the issue, well... one of many, I suppose.Anyway, watch the movie, and go in with an open mind. And my opinion probably shouldn't be taken seriously since I enjoyed 'Daredevil' with Ben Affleck.(I also hate to be THAT guy, but I swear, anytime someone of color replaces someone in a movie (wasn't the first time Johnny was black, though), it gets negative reviews... Maybe I'm just being THAT GUY, but I don't think it's a coincidence)"
" My Review!
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,3,"I really don't know if Marvel Cinematic Universe had planned to put some seriousness in making this movie. From what I see, all the characters lacked the feel of being a fantastic four team member. Only plus point comparing this movie with Fantastic Four (2005) and Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007) is that, the ""Thing"" looked absolutely brilliant. I mean WOW!!! All rugged, strong, scary.If you're a fantastic four fan, go ahead, watch it. You're going to love it. Others, I wouldn't even recommend watching it.Peace Out!"
" It really isn't that bad.
",2019-08-05 00:00:00,6,"The director wanted to go in a different direction, more like his previous movie chronicle. He wanted to go in a more horror direction and I think it would have been more interesting that way and to see the four in a new light like that but fox took over and controlled everything that he wanted to do. But I think compared to the 2005 one it's about the same. They both could be better but are fine the way they are. I wish the director would have gotten his chance to take it into his own light."
" BEST FANTASTIC FOUR MOVIE OF ALL!
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,9,"I dont know why people hate this movie, i just loved it and i thought it was easily the best Fantastic Four movie of all time. Now first off im gonna state the bad things where there was only 1 thing, ALL THE GOOD PARTS WERE CUT OUT! The part when Ben drops out of the plane in the trailer was so cool and i was waiting the whole time for that part, i heard that there were many scenes that were cut out but not the best part, so for that im very sad. Now the good stuff which is all the movie. Doctor Doom looked so good and did a great job at being a perfect villain. Its makes a lot of sense and shows how the kids get their powers. The thing looked cool and the cinematics was god amazing, especially the shoulder shot when doctor doom was walking down the hall killing everyone with the light flickering oh god that was cool. It all fit together well but the ending felt short even though it was 1 hour and 40 minutes and i actually thought the ending was OK and wasn't that bad. My dad and mom liked and i loved it and like i said i love the movies that everyone hates."
" This movie is very under rated
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,8,"This reboot of thr Fantastic four franchise wasnt ment to be an action packed superhero movie.

" Made Batman and Robin looked like a golden masterpiece
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,1,"What can I say? It's sooooo boring! I rather watch The Amazing Spider-Man 2 because at least it has a heart more than the movie. I've seen worst superhero movies in my days but this one has to be the worst because it's just trying so hard to be like the dark knight. They even follow the same thing as TASM but much worse and uninteresting. If you want a good fantastic four movie than watch the previous two because at least they're more fun, even the 1994 one is better sadly. Don't watch this movie at all"
" Worst movie of all time
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,1,"I wish that I could remove this movie from my brain because it was god awful. The story was boring, acting was bad, and the movie completely butchered the characters. This movie makes Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver Surfer look like masterpiece."

" I wanted to see a good movie, but what I got is a disappointment.
",2019-06-16 00:00:00,3,"Fantastic Four will disappoint not only comic book fans, but also ordinary people and film lovers, who wanted to see a well-made and a good movie, even if they are not very familiar with the characters or read the comics, since the previous three attempts failed at everything in the magic of filmmaking and in many areas the newer movie goes in the same path as those three and the path, where the worst comic book movies go. But there are still some small aspects that keeps it far from the worst ever."
" ACTUALLY . . . . .
",2019-06-11 00:00:00,8,I'm rather enjoying this movie. It has young intelligent people that are hard working and want to become something.
" Not sure what I'm missing.
",2019-05-31 00:00:00,7,"I guess if you have no history with this franchise, you will find this to be an average, but totally enjoyable superhero movie. I did. However, if this franchise is the only thing you have to live for, this film will, apparently, ruin your life. Seek solidarity in the mouth-foamy, red-faced, vein-poppy 1-star reviews. It's kind of amusing.For everyone else, though, the movie is fine. It's okay. Get some snacks, zone out for a bit. It's not that deep."

" I can not believe this
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,5,"I have watched the other two fantastic four movies with jessica alba. They were far from great. But they were decent sci-fi/action movies.
This is not.
Let me start with the fact that the movie deserves less than 5 stars, the only reason I did not chose to put 1 or 2 stars is because at least it is watchable(even though it is awfully boring) and it is not hideous (lately many movies are hideous), so I supported it a little bit.
This is a kids movie (except from some deaths) . It is boring, predictable, simple.
Bad direction,boring dialogues, pointless. The acting is horrible.
I can not even consider it a movie. It is like kids theatre act.
It is the first time in my life that I have seen a superhero movie and could not keep my eyes open. I felt sleepy all the time because it was BORING.
But keep in mind that at least it is watchable, nothing disgusting happens, nothing upsetting happens. It is like a kid's perception about quantum physics.
It is innocent. That is why I am not so hard on this movie despite the absence of essence."
" Don't Watch
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,1,"There is not a single good thing about this movie, just don't watch it. The original Fantastic 4 movie wasn't good either, but it's about 100 times better than this movie."
" The Non Sequi-Four
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,2,"Let's be honest. No one is reading reviews of this movie to decide if it's worth watching (spoiler alert: it's NOT). We read these because we were conned into wasting our time, want to share our disdain, and possibly squeeze SOME entertainment from this train wreck. So let the bashing begin.Choose a direction Josh Trank. Or Fox. Or someone. The film is a tasteless stew, made up of leftover cliches, and spoiled by too many cooks. Add 20 minutes dull, joyless, and amazingly-monotoned John Hughes film. Mix in a low-rent Fast and Furious, because Johnny (Michael B Jordan) is a rebellious engineer. Then a few mins of Project Almanac, add in Avengers (cause teammates gotta fight), and bring to a boil with a 10 minute head-popping snuff film (because evil guy is evil). Garnish with a half-hour, unintelligible, third act calamity and serve with a ham-handed denouement complete with humorless-jokes.Was there ANYTHING of value in this dumpster fire? Well, far and away the best ingredient of this bland mess was about 7 minutes of a body-horror film, which did show true promise. It was an intriguing take on the superhero genre, but ultimately only served to highlight how uninspired the remainder of this ""film"" was. Still, that earned it an extra Star... bringing it to 2/10.Now, every movie has problems. But Fantastic Four takes that idea to a new level, let's name just A FEW: No character has steady motivation. Supposed genius-level intellects that never make a good decision. There are better forums for a potentially world-ending device than a high-school science fair. Don't ""check out"" the glowing cracks of energy without equipment. Or tools. Or while drunk. And certainly don't touch it.Don't initiate 'manual override' for rogue scientists in an unknown danger, on an unknown planet, contaminated with who knows what. Stop ""routing emails through a relay"" while on the run, Reed. WHO ARE YOU EMAILING?!! Why would a ""red-alert"" emergency in a top secret facility inexplicably open all the doors? (Because when something goes wrong here, it's probably just a fire drill.) The limitless, undefined, god-like powers that Dr. Doom has. Dialogue like: ""He is stronger than any of them... Not stronger than all of them."" Good one, Fox. And needlessly choking the hero, just so he can monologue like a good villain. It was a 100-minute trailer for a never-to-be-made sequel.I could go on. But I feel we've all wasted enough time on this movie. Don't you?"
" Umm....WTF?
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,3,"Thought exercise. If Black Lightning became white. If Storm from the X-Men turned into a white punk chick with a mohawk. If Black Panther was played by George Clooney. If Pee Wee Herman played Shaft , people would lose their mind and scream racism and blackball whoever wrote and made it from Hollywood. So , ah , The Human Torch has been two entities over the last oh ,80 YEARS. An android that would eventually become Vision. And Sue Storm's brother. Bring in a 3rd Human Torch , say Johnny died and they found a person with nearly the same powers and I'm fine with it. The FF has had a rotation of members at times it wouldn't have been that odd. This was just pure pandering and it showed as it produced a piece of garbage."
" ...

" The Worst of the Worsts Marvel Movies and the Worsts owned by FOX!
",2019-05-04 00:00:00,1,"Fant4stic (2015), directed by Josh Trank, is one of the superhero movie remakes which are always concerned to have better special effects than the previous versions of them but this movie turned out to be much different than other remakes. It's so BAD! Almost everything in here sucks!
The acting was also one of the problems that turned Fant4stic into a...Fantastic Four parody starring Miles Teller as Reed Richards, Kate Mara as Sue Storm, Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm, Michael B. Jordan as Human Torch? I mean that character in this movie was nothing like in the comics. Blonde hair, white skin but in here black hair and black skin. You got the wrong cast! Also Victor Von Doom looked like a piece of turd. He was more like a parody character and spoke like a character in a parody. Everything he did was funny. His hood and cape made him a bigger turd. He looked completely worse than Dr. Doom in Fant4stic (2005).
The plot was a complete MESS! People didn't want to spoil plots to others but the thing is this movie doesn't have anything to spoil! The Fant4stic got their powers, Dr. Doom came and created his new universe and they had to stop them which they succeeded. This plot was almost the worst of the worsts. There were more significant stuffs from the comics that they didn't take: humor, joy,... I barely laughed at this movie, like there's nothing funny at all. I only laughed at the terrible CGI they had done.
The visual effects was thought to be the best of the movie but then it was opposite. It was also one of the worsts about this movie. The background's okay but the CGI was quite cheesy. I mean look what they had done to Reed's arm when he stretched it. It looked so bad (as bad as a movie from the 90s trying to use CGI that wasn't invented yet like The Mummy Returns (the Scorpion King looked like something we wanted to laugh at, not to fear)). Even though thi movie was owned by FOX, nothing could be done greatly.
I really wanted to like the movie, but there was nothing to like, nothing to be impressed. We are talking about superheroes, not science projects and this movie, it took most of the minutes about science projects here and science projects there. There's too much. The superheroes time was so short like only half an hour when Doom came back and the Fant4stic tried to stop him. It was a terrible idea to add too much of science in this movie but anyway, it was already bad. This is one superhero movie nobody wanted to see.Points: 2.4/10"
" Not Worth it
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,2,"Went to watch this expecting it to be pretty good even though my expectations were pretty low to begin with. Even then the movie was a disappointment and definitely came out feeling like there should've been more. Didn't really relate to the characters, too much backstory on two characters and little plot at all. At the end I was like ""is that all?"" and ""that's it?"" The ending was set up really badly and the ending was rushed. Hard to find much good in this one, maybe the fact that their was at least some action."
" The worst reboot of reboots
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,3,"The cast, the special effects, the story, the melting body of Doom, this is just too much! When it came out and I went to the cinema, might have been the first time in my life that I regretted being there. Honestly, I had high hopes for it, but not anymore, unless someone else takes over the franchise and rethinks it in a way that we will directly jump to action, no more origin story. Like Spidey. Take a hint, Marvel!"
" The worst F4 ever.
",2019-04-27 00:00:00,2,This reboot is horribly disrespectful to Marvel characters. What's the point in rebooting? Couldn't they just continue from Silver Surfer? He's alive you know. Really really disappointed.The only reason this didn't get a 1 star is because the movie is sleek in production compare to the last 2. OMG! What did I just re-watched. Yup I did re-watch it in 2019. I must be sadistic.
" I think they got something mixed up here.
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,3,"So instead of having a little bit of setup and showing characters learning how to use theirenew powers we are shown nearly 2 hours of nothing until the ""fantastic"" four get their powers. But thankfully the last 14 damned minutes of the movie had a villain. Wait that isn't the right word, they had a dude who wanted to go home. I think the hero's and villains got mixed up along with plot setup."
" Outer Space
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,10,These characters gained special abilities by a fluke accident. I like the female super powers. It's a good movie.
" What the heck happened?
",2019-04-12 00:00:00,3,"A crossover between fantastic four, X-Men and Avengers would've been awesome to see but after this movie, I highly doubt it's going to happen. The very first F4 was 50x better than this."
" Had Potential
",2019-03-30 00:00:00,5,"Had potential, but...Yeah, the many 'what went wrongs' with this film. The Fantastic Four with Jessica Alba wasn't perfect, but at least there was chemistry between the four of them and there were some good fighting scenes, and it was fun at times.This version of Fantastic Four falls flat in every area. There is no chemistry between the four of them and that's because there's no arc built for them to come together as a team. This film needed another 30 minutes of fighting another villain so the chemistry could come together because at the end of the film, you're saying to yourself 'I don't want to see a sequel with these four again.'Also, there's no arc for an apology by Reed (Miles Teller) to Ben (Jamie Bell). Yes, Reed apologizes, but Ben never forgives him, but instead, they fight Doom together for 10 minutes and then all of the sudden everything is peachy keen between the two of them. There was never a scene showing the forgiveness. There was never a scene where all four really fight together and become a team, and show the chemistry. There was never really any fun. Instead, everything was just lost in the bad plot."
" Beyond terrible
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,1,"This film is is a complete and epic failure.Nothing about this film or characters was even remotely true to anything Marvel ever created. This film was made by people who don't understand the genre or how passionately people care about the characters they butchered.This was only made so the rights wouldn't default back to Marvel.
No other reason. The deal Fox had with Marvel stated that they had to produce a film every so many year or the right to the franchise would default back to Marvel.
This film was only made because of that. They didn't care if they where even close to capturing the spirit of the comic or the characters. Which they missed entirely.Thankfully this missed the mark so badly that there will never be an attempt to modernize or recreate Marvel's first family of super heroes.This isn't even worth watching on netflix or cable. Save yourself the agony and wait till Marvel does something wonderful with this now that the right are back in their hands with the Disney purchase of Fox."
" I don't understand
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,2,"You know I don't care if the characters are black, white, Hispanic, Asian, or whatever, but the story line e is so screwed up. How can the first fantastic four have four Caucasians, then this one we have an African American and 3 white people. The story line was in the original was they received their powers in space and now they get there powers here?????????? What the f¿??????????? Hey Hollywood when you produce a film sequel follow the storyline of The originals. that would be like having Han Solo being played by Harrison Ford being Ben vereen in The last Jedi, how stupid is that?"
" What happened to Johnny Storm?
",2019-03-10 00:00:00,2,You should never make changes that affect the identity of a franchise. Johnny Storm has always been a white guy. True fans of comics stayed away from this huge mistake of a movie. This franchise has been ruined.
" Fox Faketastic Four Is Horriblly adapated
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,1,Fox Faketastic Four Is Horribly adapted just like the rest of Fox's Xmen Movies. I am glad they are going back to Marvel.
" A Misunderstood Movie
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,7,"I passed on Fantastic Four at cinema's due to the negative reviews upon it's release in 2015. I've recently watched it on TV even though I was sceptical, and I honestly can't figure out why there are so many negative reviews from critics and the general public, especially the 1 star reviews which is ridiculous and narrow minded.Do I think this is one of the best Marvel movies? No I don't, but then I don't interpret this film as a typical superhero movie and neither should you. Instead, this film should be interpreted as a crossover between a Marvel production and a standalone Sci-fi movie which focuses on the concept of inter-dimensional travel, not just the fight between good and evil.I would've awarded it with 8 stars if the showdown with Victor Von Doom near the end had more detail instead of feeling rather rushed. However, I certainly feel that Fantastic Four is worthy of 7 stars and I suggest for people who like Sci-fi Movies to watch this with an open mind and ignore the low ratings."
" audiences are certainly not just going to see them for visual effects
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,3,"With more and more Marvel movies, audiences are certainly not just going to see them for visual effects. Aesthetic fatigue is becoming more and more obvious. Marvel needs to think deeply about what the real meaning of so many hero films is."
" The lame remake of a really dull franchise
",2019-02-18 00:00:00,2,"There was absolutely no reason for this movie. The first two F4 movies were really boring to watch, and this part came to add nothing.This is what you get when you squeeze the last drop out of a long dead premise.Don't waste your money & time on that."
" Uhhhhh
",2019-02-11 00:00:00,1,"One of the most poorly made superhero movies of all time. Honestly, Daredevil was twice as good as this garbage.Waste of time, money, and anticipation. The climax felt like a children's novel.Pretty sure the power rangers could take out this weak cast of so-called ""heroes"""
" Do you really want to see this?
",2019-02-08 00:00:00,2,"Over the years I have heard that Batman & Robin was the worst superheroes movie ever made. After I lost 100 minutes of my life watching this film, I'm pretty sure this is the worst superheroes movie ever made. You can watch this film ONLY to check my review. Good luck!"
" Green Lantern 2
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,2,"This movie takes a great cast, great story and villain and turn them into a bad mix.
Flat acting and cringe lines didn't save any of what could be considered decent in this movie."
" Very underwhelming
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,3,I can never watch the whole movie just because of how boring the plot is. The movie was incredibly underwhelming. I would not recommend this movie at all.
" Fantastic Bore
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,3,"Now, the visuals look the slightest bit decent, which means bad in my book. The actors actually tried to do their best, but it was covered by a lot of crap. The story is boring and differs away from the comic books. The plot is just too confusing for even the smartest man alive to figure it out. The humor is not funny at all. The editing sucks. And the direction. Josh Trank, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? From Chronicle to this? Why? To be short, this movie sucks."
" This was almost a great movie
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,1,"They had a great idea, solid writers, and a good cast. Not to mention they obviously had a good budget. But instead of making an entirely new movie about young scientists who break inter-dimensional travel, they chose to dump all over one of the best and well respected origin stories in comic book history. I assume it was so they could slap a familiar name on the title and reel in a few suckers that way.This was almost a great movie, but instead it became a really bad imitation of a FF movie. I literally regret watching it."
" A 90-minute movie that has the pacing of a three-hour drama
",2018-12-26 00:00:00,4,"The problem with Fantastic Four: Secret of the Ooze is that it takes too long to get the ball rolling, and when the ball finally does roll, it's not that impressive. This 90-minute superhero movie has the pacing of a three-hour drama. Plus, they sucked all the fun out of the story and the characters. I don't know if this movie deserved all the hatred it got, but it's definitely one I won't be watching again."
" That's all?
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,1,I was waiting for something to happen and then the movie was over.
" THE FIRST DECENT MOVIE ABOUT FANTASTIC FOUR!
",2018-11-25 00:00:00,10,"People just didn't understand the plot cause it was too complex I think, but the movie IS EPIC, it's what we the fans of fantastic four been waiting for all out life, finally, it's PERFECTION IN ALL SENSES, I've already watched it like 5 times, and till now, nobody has said why they don't like it, so, I guess people ""didnt like it"" because they have no personality or own opinions and just say what others say to play along, the movie is a 10/10 AMAZING!!!"
" a failed attempt at rebooting a classic
",2018-11-18 00:00:00,2,Review: I really enjoyed this movie because it is a much more realistic take though different than the fantastic four source material. The direction and screenplay are both really intriguing. The casting and acting are both really good. This movie had all the elements to be a really good movie but because the screenwriter chose to go in a different direction than the source material alienating the fans of the comic book and causing it to fall flat. All in all I would give this three out of a possible five stars.
" Average retelling with the phenomenal and sensational superheroes taking on Doctor Doom
",2018-11-16 00:00:00,5,"A decade after the original film ¨Fantastic Four¨ (2005) with Ioan Gruffud , Jessica Alba , Kerry Washington , Julian MacMahon , directed by Tim Story was released, this film was rebooted because Jessica Alba decided not to do another ""Fantastic Four"" film and Chris Evans had moved on to play another Marvel comic book hero Captain America . Fantastic Four (2015), which starred Miles Teller as Reed Richards, Kate Mara as Susan Storm, Michael B. Jordan as Johnny Storm and Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm, was a darker recounting of the ""Fantastic Four"" story and failed at the box office . It deals with four young outsiders join an investigation team at New York to carry out an experimental space voyage . Soon they learn that the research facility has a covenant with NASA to transport astronauts to the other universo . However , they decide to go by themselves , to be the first humans to reach the strange place . Then the youngsters teleport to an alternate world and a dangerous universe ; but things go awry, it alters their physical form in shocking ways. Further, they achieve super-powers, but Victor/Doctor Doom is left behind . Four people are forever changed and the four must learn to harness their new abilities and work together to save Earth from a former friend turned enemy. Reed Richards , inventor and leader of the group gains the ability to stretch his body and takes the name Mr. Fantastic . Sue Storm, gains the ability to turn invisible and create force fields becoming The Invisible Girl . Her brother, Johnny Storm, becomes The Human Torch with the ability to control fire, including covering his own body with flame , as Johnny morphing into a ball of flames . And Reed's friend , Ben Grimm , is turned into the super-strong , super-tough Thing . Together they become a team of super-heroes and use their unique powers to foil the evil plans of villains .The incredible quartet taking on the threats to the world with their extraordinary force .Change is coming.When you change the world, prepare to defend it. Beyond darkness... beyond fear... lies the fantastic... However there is an accident and they are all affected by the power in the planet.
The spectacular and bizarre adventures of Marvel comics group's greatest super-heroes team .The movie blends thrills , noisy action , comic book , spectacular feats , overwhelming special effects and it results to be pretty entertaining but mediocre , including a silly and ridiculous plot .This is a free adaptation from famous comic book by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee , taking parts here and there . The screenplay is pure entertainment but far from Marvel canon , containing some absurd and embarrassing scenes . The plot is well known , plain and simple , it begins with an experimental space journey financed by a strange N.Y. Research Institute . But the starship arrives in another world and things get worse , and they find themselves turning into fantastic Super-heroes .The Fantastic Four become into team of Super-heroes and use their supernatural powers to battle the nasty enemy, Doctor Doom .The picture is regularly realized with state-of-art FX , impressive production values and so-so casting formed by agreeable young main actors . And for the first time , The Thing/Jamie Bell was created in computer-generated rather than going through make-up or prosthetics . Amazing array of technical special effects with rousing action set pieces illuminate the full-blown feats carried out by the Fantastic four . The final duel between the protagonists and villain super-hero Doctor Doom is breathtaking and moving . Many comic-book fans disliked the way Doctor Doom was portrayed , but original series author Stan Lee, agreed with them , though here Stan Lee declined to make his usual cameo . It has been reported that 20th Century Fox interfered with the film, to the point in which Josh Trank's original movie layout was changed drastically , as some set pieces don't make sense , that's why one of the most major changes was the cutting out of 3 whole action scenes . Several moments in the movie take their visual cue from Jack Kirby's work in the very first ""Fantastic Four"" comic book . Although have given bad reviews to this film , I think that is amusing with spectacular scenes during whole the movie . The motion picture was middlingly directed by Josh Trank (Chronicle , The Kill point series) . It was really panned by critics , that's why after the disappointing reviews, Josh Trank went on to tweet that he'll ""never be working on a comic book movie again"". Trank finalized his version of the film in 2014, the studio was dissatisfied and didn't like the director's work, demanded re-shoots, which were done in early 2015.
Other films about ¨Fantastic four¨ are the following ones : 1994 ¨Fantastic four¨ by Olley Sassone with Alex Hyde White , Jay Underwood , Rebecca Staab , Michael Smith , and ¨Fantastic Four¨ 2004 by Tim Story , this is the best version dealing with the spaceflight crew who suffer Gamma ray attacks in the Van Allen belt , being formed by team leader scientific named Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffud) , the pilot named Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) , Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) , his brother Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and included Victor Doom . As Mr. Fantastastic, leader of the group gains the ability to stretch his body to any shape ; Sue Storm achieves the skill to become invisible girl and projects telekinetic fields ; Johnny Storm as the human torch creates a flying blazing ball and with power to control the fire . It is followed by the sequel titled ¨Rise of the Silver Surfer ¨, with the same players and Doug Jones as Silver Surfer ."
" Fantasstic Bore
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,1,"This film was nothing but cold and crammed non-stop action that could have been made into numerous films instead of being in this one film. And that guy chewing gum every time he had a scene was making me almost lose my mind. Give your mouth a break, will ya? But seriously, there was more physical activity that was not talking that made me have an impossible time liking any of the characters here. Shame. The only reason I give this 1 star is because of Toby Kebbell's very handsome sex appeal and that I find Toby talented, adaptable, smart, and playful but deserving more than this treacherous abomination called ""Fantastic"" Four."
" There's really only one problem
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,4,"Here's an analogy:A student has to do a presentation on World War II. He gathers a ton a good information on the causes of the war, and the events leading up to it. World War I, mistreatment of Germany, invasion of Poland, he's got it all. Then, he puts even more effort into the bombing of Pearl Harbor.
Unfortunately, he realizes that his report is due tomorrow, and he slaps together the Normandy Invasion, Battle of Midway, Island Hopping, and the Atomic Bomb all in a single day. The Battle of the Bulge doesn't even get a mention.This is precisely the issue with Fantastic Four. It honestly does a solid job of introducing the setting, the characters, and the conflict. But it takes 70 minutes to do this, and then 30 minutes later you're sitting on the couch wondering what exactly just happened."
" starsCOME A LONG WAY SINCE THE GARAGE
",2018-10-30 00:00:00,5,"In this version of the Fantastic 4, our foursome or five-some are created when they transport to an inter-dimensional planet called ""Earth Zero."" This film re-introduces the characters with all the action crammed into the final 10 minutes of a 100 minute film. Like the Ryan Reynolds ""Green Lantern"" this film was simply intended to introduce the characters before creating an action packed sequel. Judging from the box office and reviews, that aspect is less probable than Rick Perry be able to name all the cabinet posts, even though it is in production and scheduled to come out in 2017.I like the fact they changed how the group was formed, creating a transporter to another world with an infinite stream of odd super villains. If you like alternative beginnings, check out ""Justice League, Gods and Monsters."" I don't know what happened to Jessica Alba, apparently she got old and fat and had to be replaced by Kate Mara. None of the four I consider as good as the last group. Miles Teller needed to carry the film. He worked out well as a geek, but not so well as a super hero. The dialogue needed more humor. The writers failed to create dialogue and killed the film.Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Some PG-13 swearing."

" Wrong, way wrong!!
",2018-10-11 00:00:00,1,"This is not the Fantastic Four by no other means than the names!! If you know the comic, you know they are not kids like they portray them in this garbage!! Also, the Storm siblings are not what they show in this, white & black!! Why they tried to REMAKE this franchise is a mystery because the two before this were pretty darn good, unlike what most want to say!! The 2005 version was slow for a reason, THEY HAD TO BUILD THE ORIGIN!!! Not having MCU involved is another reason it was good & worked!! MCU has ruined the marvel comic movies just like the DC movies have been ruined since Batman Returns & Superman Returns!! Over all, don't watch this rubbish if you are a fan of the comics or the other two movies!! Yes, MCU's hands are all over this film!!"

" Only fantastic at creating unlikable characters...
",2018-09-29 00:00:00,3,"Seriously- this movie craps on my childhood. 
EVERY character is thoroughly unlikable. No friendships (the key to their team & the longevity of the franchise), no integrity, no humor... really nothing but selfish self-interest. Makes for incredibly bland & 2 dimensional characters.
This could have been SO much more- & in the hay day of superhero films... there's no excuse for it not to be.
Marvel took 3rd tier characters Iron Man & Captain America, and 4th tier characters Black Panther & Doctor Strange and made them nuanced, interesting, relevant, and even beloved. Somehow the opposite has been done here- 1st tier characters, absolutely dragged through the muck & stripped of anything that made them interesting, or themselves."

The actual reason caucasoids dislike this film is the most pathetic card to play in the deck of legitimate reasons not to appreciate this film...RACE HATRED. Don't believe it, check for yourself. A great many negative reviews echo dissatisfaction that MJ is human torch. These are the same morons who object to a lead black guy in Star Wars or the probability of a Black Superman (which has already been done ✅). If you chose to not like the movie,then, so be it. But, rise above the predictable caucasoid response. This world ain't yours alone, get over it savages!"
" My god.....
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,1,"It's actually insulting how boring and uneventful this movie is. So much build up for nothing, so much potential, all for absolutely nothing. These are all great actors, this plot has been done before, but way better than this this. This movie actually angers me to my core, I hope Disney and Marvel can incorporate these heroes into the MCU and do a much better job, because they deserve it."
" Great movie
",2018-09-11 00:00:00,9,This is a great movie. It has great acting. It also has great special effects. It also has great story line. It is a very fast past movie. See it. It is better the original Fantastic four
" Well.....that was bad

" Love this movie!
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,8,I've watched this movie lots of times and still enjoy it every time. I've tried watching the original F4 but think it's absolutely rubbish and turned it off. I think this version is better enjoyed by adults. Give it a chance don't judge by the reviews.

" An absolute painful slog of a movie
",2018-06-13 00:00:00,1,"After watching the bore that was Suicide Squad, I didn't think it could get worse. But, this film proved me so wrong, that it's barely even funny anymore. Despite me really not liking Suicide Squad, this movie somehow makes that film look like a cult classic, as this movie is so incredibly uneventful and painfully boring, that it's debatable whether or not it's more fun to stare at a wall. This is because this movie tries to set up another movie that never happens while completely forgetting to make a good movie on its own. Literally nothing happens in this movie. All it is is exposition. It sets up the fantastic four universe, and nothing more. It stretches throughout the entirety of this film, which can make this movie extruciatingly boring. And no, there's nothing about this movie that isn't bad. While the actors did a decent job in their roles, the script and scenes are so bland, that nothing really worked. The special effects in this film are attrocious for the amount of money this movie needed to be made. Nothing was convincing whatsoever, and the fact that they were so below subpar for the amount of money used for this movie really makes me question humanity somewhat. Overall, there's not a single thing that's good about this film. It is so boring and slow that even the worst films can be more of a joy to watch than this, as this is an absolute painful slog of a movie."

" Marvel's New Film Not Fantastic, But It's No Failure
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,3,"Note: My thoughts on this film have changed dramatically since this review. Today, I completely agree with the majority opinion: the characters are weak, the tone is overly dour, and the film completely lacks a second act due to studio meddling. Today, my score would probably be 1.5 out of 5 (one of the worst of the year). I don't know what possessed me to give this a decent review in 2015, but please enjoy my faint praise below:2.5 out of 5 stars (decent)Marvel's newest, non-Avengers offering: Fantastic Four is not what you think it is. The marketing for this made it look overly dark and contemplative for a film of its type, leading me to believe it would be a serious character study that would bore me to sleep. The reviews thus far have said that this movie is dull, overly dark, and anticlimactic. I wholly disagree. Though it is noticeably flawed, Fantastic Four is a fun, decently entertaining sci-fi action film with some good humor and likable characters.Reed Richards (Miles Teller of the Divergent series and Whiplash) is a misunderstood genius who has been building a machine that would allow interdimensional travel with his best friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell of 2005's King Kong) since the 5th grade. Now a senior in high school, Reed displays his machine for a science fair, only to have his teacher to laugh it off.Reeds' luck changes when he is given the opportunity by scientist Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey of The Wire) to get his machine up and running. Reed will work with Franklin's children, hothead Johnny (Michael B. Jordan), his adopted daughter Sue (Kate Mara), and Frank's old colleague Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) to achieve this. The quartet eventually makes their dreams come true, but that comes at a price that none of them could have ever seen coming.I understand that my plot description seems a bit rote, but I cannot tell you anymore of the story without spoiling it. I can assure you it is worth it.The cast is fine in their respected roles. Miles Teller and Kate Mara are believable as nerds, and Toby Kebbell does fine with what he is given. Michael B. Jordan provides good comic relief, but he isn't very interesting. Jamie Bell gets the short end of the stick, as he doesn't have enough to do in the film, and disappears for some of the first act, only appearing when the plot needs him to. Because of this, I didn't have a strong connection with the character, something that the last set of films (yes, this is a reboot) nailed.Action-wise, it's good when it's there. There's one action sequence at the beginning, a very short one in the middle, and one at the end. They are intense, well-shot, and don't go on too long (In fact, I wouldn't have minded if the climax was a bit longer, but it's good as is). Josh Trank (who co-wrote the script) confidently directs the action, but he could improve in directing his actors.In my review of Ant Man, I mentioned the good chemistry between the actors. Fantastic Four is the exact opposite. The actors don't have consistent chemistry with each other, making many of the scenes awkward to watch. I understand that Reed and Sue aren't going to be like Buffy and Willow right away, but Reed's chemistry with Ben is so bad that it's nearly laughable. On the bright side, Franklin and Johnny work passably off of each other, but only passably. This is not the script's fault (though it is far from a perfect gem), it's the fault of Josh Trank. This is only his second film, and I feel it was a mistake to give a big project like this to someone who isn't experienced enough to handle the pressures of it.My final complaint is the amount of profanity in the movie. I normally have no issue with it, but Marvel doesn't have a lot of bad language in their movies, and this one had much more than I expected. I have seen lots of kids in Marvel theaters throughout the years, and this movie alienates that audience segment by inserting the profanity. Kids beg for the merchandise for these movies, so putting in profanity only prevents them from being able to see it. Those kids might be a saving grace for the movie, given its current projected box office returns.Fantastic Four is not Marvel's best by any means, but it certainly not its worst either. The individual actors are good and the humor is appropriately placed. When present, the action sequences are intense and decently exciting, and the script is mostly sound (despite a few over-the-top lines and catchphrases at the end, but they are forgivable.) See Fantastic Four at the $2.00 Theater, and you should be decently entertained.Rated PG-13 for Sci-Fi Action Violence and Language"
" Fant4stic is the epitome of doomed reboots.
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,2,"Fant-4-Stic. Fantastic Four. Fant4stic Four. 4 Fant4stic. Fant-I honestly don't give a damn-stic. Well, everyone said it was dreadful. After years of avoidance, I finally took the plunge and delved into the modern reimagining of The Fantastic Four. Someone hold me! I can't. To formulate a review would be the equivalent of approaching 20th Century Fox and asking ""can you give the rights back to Marvel?"". They'll show you the exit. Ohhh...this was terrible. Reed Richards, with the help of a ""scientific"" team, devise an inter dimensional teleportation device where one journey causes the team to gain powerful abnormalities. Where do I even start!? This is clearly Fox's fault. I can only assume that director Trank had a clear vision, and at times there are glimpses of greatness, but the studio had to get involved to keep the rights to the franchise and quickly release this reboot before they were offered to another distributor. Rushed is an understatement. You don't need to be a film critic or aficionado to notice the abhorrent production issues. Mara wearing a wig one scene and not the next, the rapidest anti-climatic third act ever, horrendous visual effects (ewww) and no attention to creating a riveting screenplay. I can't even claim the script to be mediocre, it's just the worst. 'Fant4stic: Plot Conveniences Strike Back' would've been more apt. None of it makes sense. Every line of dialogue is spoken with such monotony and only acts as a necessary mean to further the unimaginative plot, resulting in no character development. Every cast member was terribly miscast. Teller wasn't trying, Jordan couldn't be bothered, Mara was dull as always, Bell had no opportunities and Kebbell was criminally misused. No emotional connection between these characters in the slightest. Heck, Johnny had a more emotive friendship in the first five seconds of meeting Reed than he did with his own sister! Why attend school fairs? How did Victor survive a year? Where did the cape come from!? This isn't a film, it's a tool!! A god damn tool!! Fantastic this is not."
" Better than these reviews and those of Critics!
",2018-05-24 00:00:00,9,"I think this film is a lot better than "" War for the Planet of the Apes"", the latter movie got good reviews, but bored me to death -- what am I supposed to do, learn sign language to appreciate that Apes crap?. I'm tracking all these Marvel Movies to what I remember from reading the comics in the 1970's. This movie is good with reservations.
1) Too much time spent with young Reeves's as a child and his ""Science Project"".
2) Not nearly enough ""romance"" between Reeves and Sue.
3) No time spent on Ben's adjustment to his new self.
4) No time spent on any of the Four in developing their powers and teamwork.
5) The BEST scenes in the older FF film were those adjusting to Earth Society; those were absent in this film.
UPDATE: Just watched the film again -- and this time I gave it a ""9"" (up from a ""7"") All of my reservations above are true; but I think this second viewing has allowed my to view the film more on its own. (And, Sue Storm seemed to be cuter this viewing) Very, very good film; give it a watch!"
" A true 1 star
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,1,"About no movie deserves a true 1 out of 10. If some things are good, it at least deserves a 2. But this, is a masterpiece of my garbage can I burned a billion years ago. Nothing is satisfying. It doesn't deliver an origin story or anything. No action I remembered. Actually, I don't really remember anything from this movie. This was just bland and didn't even have a clean fresh team up. It was so dark and blue, it was like it tried to make the most cliched but unoriginal hackeysack possible. The whole movie was pointless in anything. Most of the time weren't even what you'd want in an action movie. And it's not so bad, it's funny. It wasn't even trying bad. And the villain is another super cliched thing. He was a villain for no reason and just averagely cliched. It's impossible to possibly support this. One of 20 worst movies I've ever seen, possibly 10."
" Three Fails
",2018-04-30 00:00:00,5,"I wasn't even a fan of the first FF, nor the second, so I really didn't think I'd like the reboot.Occasionally Marvel makes a mistake ala Hulk, Spider Man 3 and Fantastic Four. Correcting that mistake with a remake has not been the answer (ala Incredible Hulk, Amazing Spider Man and Fantastic Four 2015). They should do with the failed solo acts what they did with the Hulk and make them part of a collaborative effort.When Hulk came out I was devastated because he is one of--if not my favorite--comic book character. His two solo movies were atrocious. Then they put him on a team and all was right with the world. No, Hulk couldn't carry a movie by himself but he could certainly be a strong team member. Maybe FF can't carry movies by themselves but maybe they would be excellent in a team member role (like helping the avengers). That's the only future I see for them."
" Sucks ass
",2018-04-22 00:00:00,1,"This movie is the definition of horrible. Its sucks complete ass and its just traumatizing. The cast in the movie is good but the movie itself.....well i think you understand. So do yourself a favor and dont watch it , Thanks."
" Good movie, rushed ending
",2018-04-20 00:00:00,10,"It wasn't a perfect movie but i really don't understand why people didn't like it that much. I loved the fact that there wasn't that many fights scenes. The story was interesting by its own without adding action that wasn't needed. It was a good SF movie, even if, the movie in the end felt rushed... i wouldn't say it's a good super hero movie, so maybe that's why people didn't like it, but for me, i thought this was a more interesting approach to the concept."
" One of the most boring, vapid and soulless super-hero films in a long time.
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,4,"'Fantastic Four (2015)' is genuinely one of the most boring superhero films I've seen in a long time. This vapid and soulless studio affair feels like the product of several suited silhouettes and is indicative of everything wrong with both the genre and the studio system as a whole, as it totally encapsulates the phrase 'running out of steam' and was gutted of its entire middle portion. It seriously seems as though no-one involved could muster up more than a sigh's worth of enthusiasm, truly appearing as though the entire feature was only made so that Fox could keep hold of the rights to the franchise. The picture bizarrely has very little of the four actually doing anything fantastic until the underwhelming finale. The tone is so dour that even the quote unquote 'fun stuff' is bland and, frankly, a chore to watch, something that could also be said of the entire piece. 4/10"
" Why would you watch this movie?
",2018-04-06 00:00:00,1,This movie is really dumb. Its painful to watch and makes no sense. This thing is an abomination and shouldn't exist.
" I did give it time
",2018-03-27 00:00:00,1,"There was nothing Fantastic about this movie, not a second or a scene in which you can say ""wow, now that was cool"". I understand in the world of superhero movies disbelief is seriously suspended, but to spend over half the movie with the most boring backstory imaginable (not clever, not funny , kid gets slapped around, teacher is an ass, at least have some justice prevails moments). The very second Miles Teller's pathetically weak face appears there is no doubt that the rest of this movie is going to continue to suck cause there is no way that face is going to save it. Oooh, how interesting , looking at books in the library and awards in the hallway. I think the test monkey was more into his role than any of the rest of them, and with the back story given who would care about them anyway? Source material is there for a reason and the wheel need not be reinvented to attract some imaginary movie going genre. Tell a good story with characters people care about, add some humor that isn't stupid or just plain wrong (waterboarding in 4th dimension?) Bad military guys or are those corporate suits we're supposed to not like, who the hell knows or cares. Here kids, just sit up to these chairs and test this high tech equipment, no safety or supervision required....yay, it worked first time, fist bump, uh grab (actually mildly funny moment) Does Sue like Reed now? Who knows, who cares? Oh, and let's not forget to throw in a ""it's clobberin' time "" just for nostalgia's sake. Time for Fox to get out of the Marvel business and in 10 years or so perhaps revisit this and do it right (like DC and WonderWoman, it can be done with the right script, director and cast)"
" Quite pitiful
",2018-03-27 00:00:00,3,"I read somewhere that this version of FANTASTIC FOUR - coming hot on the heels of the two instalments from the 2000s - was only made so that 20th Century Fox could keep the rights to the franchise. Whatever the reason for its existence, this turns out to be a real dud of a movie, a movie by turns dull and deeply embarrassing. A fresh new cast of actors take up the main roles, and three of them are very good, but not so here. Kate Mara has so little to do that she seems bored by it all, while Jamie Bell has even less screen time. Toby Kebbell is a fine actor (just watch DEAD MAN'S SHOES if you don't believe me) but wasted as another stock bad guy. This long-winded origin story goes on and on and on with boring experiments in a laboratory for nearly all of the running time, until the last half an hour which packs in the over the top CGI effects and explosions. It's mindless, childish, and the complete opposite of what Marvel are managing to do with their Avengers franchise at the moment."
" Oh dear. You can't make up for a poor plot with special effects.
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,3,"I saw this on TV and after 40 minutes I was thinking ""this is slow to get going"", after an hour I thought it would surely improve soon, after 90 minutes I realized I'd just wasted 90 minutes of my life but I still kept watching...Rubbish plot, poor dialogue, so-so acting.Best avoided."
" Wait, that's it?
",2018-03-11 00:00:00,2,"This movie may have confused me more than any movie ever has before. It's not awful, in the beginning. The introductions are informative but not overdone. Comedy is existent and has a good tone. It's not full of puns and crap like ""language!"" that you get in the MCU. Yet then the pace is about to pick up and...it doesn't. But wait, later in the movie the pace is setting itself up for liftoff and...the movie is over. It feels like the audience spends the entire movie waiting for the movie to start. This is disappointing because it had a lot of promise starting out and never lived up to it."
" Not fantastic 4
",2018-03-08 00:00:00,1,"I gave it another shot today, after 10 mins i thought my brain will jump out of my head and kill me, never ever......"
" There is no plot and nothing is remotely believable
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,1,"I wasn't expecting much. In fact, I was looking forward to a terrible movie. As someone who grew up on Mystery Science Theater I was looking forward to a total garbage movie, and boy did this deliver.The first thing that bothered me about this movie was that although it tossed around a lot of science terms thrown around, there wasn't even anything remotely believable about the science. It was like they didn't consult any actual scientists, but just wrote the scenes using a bunch of jargon in an attempt to sound cool.Then there is the choice to make the Fantastic Four high school kids. Who made that decision? There is no reason for them to be 18/19 years old.But the biggest problem is that the movie lacks a plot. It literally does not have a much of a story at all. All that happens is they get their powers, barely anything else. They have a brief clash with Doom, but that's it. There is no build up, there is not tension. This movie is truly terrible."
" Insufficient Movie
",2018-01-27 00:00:00,5,"The film is a reboot with a completely different but interesting storyline. The problem with this film is that there is little action in fact the film is based more on the completion of the project of the protagonists than the fight. Another problem is the duration of only 20 minutes of the bad in fact the scene of the ""Final Battle"" lasts very little and many important characters have made them become secondary as ""The Thing""."
" WOW!!!!!!
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,10,"This was the most exciting I have watched this year. After the movie I felt both happy and sad.When I came home I relised what a shitty movie this was. I later wanted my money back but they instead threatened me to force me to watch Fantastic four :rise of the silver surfer. So I did what they forced me to and now I feel really bad. Dont watch this movie it sucks. I loved everything about this movie. All from the special effects to the structure of the movie. The best part of the movie was the final fight. I hope that this will get a sequel. I also loved the villain, DR. Doom is fantastic. It's Fant4stic. But it sucks."
" This says it all
",2018-01-09 00:00:00,1,"I know I'm real late on this one. Anyways, my wife and I couldn't believe how bad this was and sat through it to see if it would get better...never did.One doesn't have to go further thank this trivia comment to understand how/why this film was so bad...""Kate Mara had initially wanted to read Fantastic Four comic books to prepare for her role as Susan Storm, but the filmmakers explained to the cast that it was unnecessary as the film was an original story not based directly on the comics.""
That's perfect. Why make a comic book superhero movie not based on the comics it came from? Result = crapola"
" Crap4stick
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,1,"Guys do you wanna know why this movie is made? Because of $$$$$$$ obviously. The plot is empty, the script is bad, the story is broken, and most of the acting is awkward. My question is where's the director's cut of the film? Daredevil Director's cut was good (better than the theatrical cut) and fans where happy. I don't blame Josh Trank because the studio trash it not him. Do you want to watch a good Fantastic Four movie? watch the one in 2005 because that film has a lot of heart compare to this film and I'm a fan of that. Don't watch the Fantastic Bore."
" Definitely the worst non-MCU Marvel film made, possibly one of the worst ever
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,1,"I won't even get into the backstage fighting and lead actor issues.. that's been reported to death. 
This ""film"" suffers from the need to hurry and make a film to retain the license and a lack of care of the quality by Fox. 
The only redeeming quality is some of the visuals but sadly the story, tone, pacing, acting (aside from Michael B Jordan who always gives his all even when the movie is terrible) kill any chance of this film being taken seriously. 
The massive and obvious reshoots as well as the story that appears to have been written from a brief browse of Marvel's First Family's Wiki and you have a recipe for disaster. Sadly Josh Trank will be blamed when editing, studio, rights holders, and speed are much more responsible for making this movie into the mess it is."
" Just say it the black guy killed this movie
",2017-12-16 00:00:00,1,"Horrible. I started watching it and I was bored from the start. I prefer the previous Fantastic Four movies, where they don't put a black actor as Sue Storms brother.
 Face it the use of black actors in roles where they are not supposed to be is starting to backfire. 
 The latest a black St. Peter in Mary Magdalene. Face it Peter was a Jew, and Jews are not brown but white. There is no brown race. 
 Miles teller is not a good actor. In fact he is boring. Next time like Christopher Nolan reboot the Fantastic Four and get the Storms to be the same race."
" Fantastic Four was okay but did not deliver the way we wanted it to.
",2017-11-19 00:00:00,10,"When I was watching Fantastic Four I was so excited but until when it came to the first half of the movie I was a bit bored because I already know what happens. So I just wanted to get to the part of the Fantastic Four crew using their powers, fight enemies with it, and get to Doctor Doom. But anyways the movie was not what I was expecting it was just a whole movie of them talking and nothing else. The only good things about the movie was the Casting Choices, Special Effects, Doctor Doom, the fight scene, Human Torch and that's pretty much it. But for the bad things about the movie was that it felt extremely slow and the story was just a repeated origin story of the Fantastic Four. So overall I give this movie a 6 because I don't know what to think about the movie besides of me being so confused about it."
" Give it back to Marvel; we don't need a fifth attempt
",2017-11-07 00:00:00,4,"The fantastic four are, an interesting group of superheroes, and it's just a shame that they could never get the Guardians of the Galaxy treatment like they should have; the 2005 film being the closest thing we'll ever get. I know that Fox has to adapt a film from the fantastic four (like the X- Men) ever 10 years or so to keep the rights to the characters, and the end result we have for this movie just proves the desperation. I've also heard a lot of controversy and problems that director Josh Trank had with the studio and vice versa.So anyway, the story. As a kid, Reed Richards discovers a way to create interdimensional travel, and after many years, succeeds. Discovering his potential, Dr. Franklin Storm offers him a scholarship, putting him together with his daughter Susan Storm and fellow young scientist Victor von Doom, to harness this new discovery. We meet Dr. Storm's son Johnny Storm, as well as Reed's best friend, Ben Grimm. One night, these young scientists embark on a mission of their own. But after something goes horribly wrong, they discover they have been given superhuman abilities. It's up to them to master their new abilities, and defeat a final threat that's a blast from the past.That's about it; the story is clunky as all hell. Dialogue is fine, actings OK, definitely not their A game. I do like Miles Teller as Reed Richards, but honestly I thought Ioan Gruffudd in the 2005 film fit the character perfectly. Kate Mara is fine as Sue Storm, and I liked Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm, but even then I don't think any of the FF movies had the definitive portrayal. I actually liked Michael B. Jordan. As the portrayals go he does showcase the kinda immature, bratty, hot headed personality Johnny is meant to have, and can have his more serious moments. The CGI is fine and I liked that we had an actual CGI Thing this time around. Looks great. The visuals are interesting to look at and the music wasn't distracting or painful to listen to.That being said this movie was just a mess. The story dragged on and by this point. Treat it how you'd treat a future Batman movie, or a Spider-Man movies; ditch the origin story, we know how they become the Fantastic Four. And if you do have to put one in, don't put us through it over half way through the film. The villain is bye the numbers, spewing the same worthless garbage we were given Batman v Superman from Lex, and he's a throwaway villain; the worst part being he's meant to be DR. DOOM! Four times, they've used him in these adaptations and they've failed. Everything about the look of the film is just bland. I guess Trank was going for the Christopher Nolan ""dark and edgy"" tone but does he have to make it look depressing too?As for Josh Trank and the studio, I'll address the studio first. I don't know what was going through their heads, cause it just feels like they made this to either just keep the rights, or make a quick buck, or both. And if that was the case, why not just hire some low key director instead of Trank? Last time I checked, Chronicle wasn't successful because he was getting beaten to a pulp with mandates and studio interference; it was successful because he was able to have creative control. No one thought the first Iron Man would be a success, but because they gave Favreau creative control, it turned into one. I could tell almost near the end this was crapped out into theaters simply to keep the rights; they knew they messed up. If Fox can't just trust creative directors with their properties, then don't hire them in the first place; just get Brett Ratner instead.I don't know exactly what Fox is even doing with the Fantastic Four rights these days. If they're keeping them simply to make a quick buck every ten years then whatever, I'd expect nothing less. But if they have the intention on making an interesting film, with ""heart, and passion, and breathtaking"" moments, they've screwed the pooch far to many times now.I'm giving Fant4Stic a 4 out of 10. I just hope the next Fantastic Four movie has the words MCU plastered on top. And yes, I've heard about the new idea for the FF, about them as kids or something. Not a fan and it comes off as desperate to me."
" Not as bad as I thought it would be
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,6,"OK, it's not perfect at all, it has some really poor editing, some clunky dialogue and plot holes that gape wide open. However, the characters were fun, I enjoyed the use of youth over the ""rich scientist"" line from the earlier movies. It was really a DIY low tech fantastic four with true angst and almost dare I say it, believable to the performances. Dr Doom was poorly executed but was in line with the relative powers of the 4. So it stepped a long way from the spandex clad comic characters but to be honest that isn't a bad thing at all for me. Some great moments, I loved the Thing who really looked alive and rocky rather than orange and rubbery. The ending wasn't as explosive as other super hero movies but again, is that a bad thing ? does it always have to be a massive climax? So on the whole it worked as a fun 90 minutes, it wasn't the disaster many claim it to be as a movie anyway"
" It is not as bad as every one says it is
",2017-10-24 00:00:00,7,"Okay, when this movie released in the cinema at Star City me and my dad went to see this movie together and we both loved it. It had good special effects and acting. However, Jamie Bell was good as Ben Grimm but was a miscast as The Thing whereas Micheal B Jordan was a miscast as both Johnny Storm and the human torch. But at least Sue Storm was more cute and hotter in this movie than the previous incarnation.But really bugs me is in this version Ben Grimm, Reed Richards, Johnny Storm and Victor Van Doom went into space and got effected with Victor left behind. But Sue got affected when the spaceship landed and created a shock wave and she fainted despite the fact she never went with them. But it was a very awesome movie but not the same as the previous incarnation and don't let these bad reviews that are written by comic book nerds, fanboys and fangirls stop you from watching this film."
" Dear god, why this film exist
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,1,"Yes I re watch and I found it to be awful, and screw 4/10, 1/10 works well. My last review suck so I'm re reviewing it. The CGI is terrible like The Thing look like KFC chicken, and when Mr. Fantastic stretches, it looks very rubbery. I feel bad for the cast, they don't deserve to be in this movie. This is way worse then Batman & Robin (1997) and Elektra (2005). This movie is so lifeless and boring. The re shots are awful like Fox try to pretend this is the real deal even though it looks terrible.I'm glad I skip this movie in theaters.This movie is poorly written and god awful plot. The old ones are way better every single way. Dr. Doom in this film SUCKS!! He look like the NS-4 from I Robot (2004). Don't watch this film, worst superhero film been made and worst FF film been made."
" Fantborestic
",2017-10-01 00:00:00,1,"It's bad really really bad the acting is too emotionless, the thematic running time they just got it all wrong, and heck most of the exciting cool action stuff is only done in 1 freaking minute and to make things more worse they always keep talking in dark rooms they have really poor grasp on the source material like how doctor doom have super powers even though in the comics he only uses his own intellect brain. The other Fantastic four movies failed too but at least it fail of what the comic books made them so special it's really a huge shame when it doesn't have anything to do with the comic books in general and when you add it all up the Hammer head film is the only one where they choose to fight crime *AND* not cause the destruction and chaos along the way HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN HOW THIS IN 2 REBOOTS YOU TRIED TO MAKE IT BETTER!?! All I could say is that there's a good way and a wrong way to ever reboot a famous franchise and this is definitely the wrong way. P.S It was made by the people who made awesome X men films how could they muck it up!?!"
" Awful
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,1,"Okay I will say right away that this is the worst comic book movie I've ever seen. Yes Batman and Robin is better than this. But that is not the important thing. I have to explain why this is number one. A lot of people were complaining about how young the cast was and how they were too young. Compared to the ages in this movie, which was high school age, the actors were actually too old for the characters. Which is just the bottom of the barrel on how bad this movie is. The first ten or so minutes were okay and tolerable because it was showing the back story of Reed and Ben as kids and it didn't feel forced. But trust me when I saw that is the only good part. To all those Fantastic Four fans, does it feel like they screwed up Johnny's age up REALLY BAD? He's Susan's younger brother in the comics, but in this movie, it seems like he might actually be OLDER than her! Why is this the case. Reed is a major jerk, unlike the comics. For just leaving the group after he got his powers with no warning just to be on his own. Von Doom, oh if you knew how much you would be screwed up here. In the comics and even 2005 film (which is a classic compared to this), he had a mask. His body wasn't metal. He just happened to wear a metal mask. And he seems really overpowered in this movie for no reason besides to give the heroes a 'challenge.' And the group wins the final battle in THREE MINUTES! No buildup, no conflict, no stress, no development. Just a fight and win. So nice for you to throw in Susan and Johnny's dad just to kill him off at the end so Von Doom can be all like 'I'm so serious, you can't beat me.' There is no character development. Just people who get angry but then make amends with everybody in time for the final battle just to kick butt. Like Ben should be mad that Reed was sort of responsible for him being the Thing. And he was for two minutes but gets over it in time for the final battle. Johnny only was involved with the project because he wanted his car back. A plot device that is NEVER expanded on. He just becomes a hero. Doesn't even mention the car at the end of the movie or any other time. When you start a plot thread, you stay with it. That is story writing basic step 1.I just can't on with this anymore. This makes Batman and Robin, Green Lantern, Supergirl, Elektra, 1990 Captain America all look like Oscars winners. Go watch the 2005 Fantastic Four film. This film makes me realize just how underrated that film is. At least that film tried to have the spirit of the comics. Which is more than I can say for this. Never make a movie out of Fantastic Four again. This if proof that it can't be done."
" Why did they reboot this?
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,3,"I know at this point it is like flogging a dead horse but this movie is all kinds of terrible. I really did not want to watch this film in the cinema so waited for it to be available on Netflix and thank god I didn't waste £8 on a movie ticket. I only wasted 1 hour and 39 minutes of my life which is much more expendable. Anyway let's get down to the meat and potatoes of this film then.The film starts off really poorly with the worst scene in this film. The school career day scene that makes no sense!! Reed Richards stands at the front of the class and says that he wants to be the first person to invent teleportation. For some reason this really angers his teacher who starts berating him in front of his class (who all look to be different ages and sitting in the exact same position at their desks for some reason). This is something a teacher would never do in a class room and this scene sets the movie up for more fails. The plot is very BORING with nothing exciting happening for 2/3 of the film! In a superhero movie you want the powers to be gained in the first 1/4 not have to sit through 50 minutes of filler until we get to something. The film feels it has to explain everything before we get to the action of the film which is at the far back end of the movie. The plot pacing is all over the place with scenes being rushed forward at inconvenient times to make way for some of the worst character development I have ever seen.The characters in this film have no development what so ever. No one learns anything, the four of them do not even become a proper team that work together and they have no real back and forth with each other. Ben Grimm is thrown into the mix when he is essentially written out of the plot half way through. Sue storm is played by a terrible actress. Kate Mara's performance is flat and she only uses two facial expressions in the entire film (one of them whilst in her force bubble thing). What's more in this film sue storm is adopted and we are told that she is originally from Kosovo or some place? I mention this point because it has sweet FA to do with her characters story arc, her emotional blueprint or anything else. It was just a useless bit of info that we did not need to be explained.Miles Teller was great in whiplash but here he is not helped by a flat, BORING script which gives him nothing to work with and not much character background to feed off. As I said before there is not one single joke between the characters and everyone is so serious (WHY SO SERIOUS??). Even the human torch, who is supposed to be the comic relief, is flat and always seems to be angry at life for some reason. Honestly after watching this movie I sat back thinking that I should cancel my Netflix subscription, the film was that frustrating.The music, cinematography and all other technical things I look for were all lost as I was just distracted by how boring and nonsensical the plot was. I guess if the sound and colour were really bad it would have registered with me but the sound and colour are just like elevator music it just is so unimportant that you don't notice it. Poor writing is what kills this movie for me. Nothing about this films plot is interesting or exciting but at least it doesn't fail on a technical aspect like suicide Squad. This is easily the worst Marvel movie of the 2010's so if I were you I'd give it a miss and watch Avengers instead."
" Not the F4 I know and love
",2017-09-07 00:00:00,3,"I feel sorry for the actors in this movie because they do their jobs well. It's just a shame the story line and characterisation has strayed so very far from the original comics. I much prefer the earlier movies which are much closer to the original comics and characters.I'm glad that plans for sequels seem to have been quashed!The worst part of the movie, for me, is when daddy Baxter propounds the possibility that the science that Reed and his friends are uncovering could be an answer to humanity's ills. The illusion that science will somehow fix all our woes (climate change the worst amongst them) is dangerous because it moves our focus away from the reality that we need to fix climate change by stopping using fossil fuels. This point may seem far from this movie, but actually Baxter's ""science as saviour"" lecture is central to the problem we face in NOT facing problems like climate change."
" No its not great, but doesn't deserve such a low rating.
",2017-09-01 00:00:00,6,"Let's start off by saying that because of it's low rating I have put off watching this until now. As it has just become available to stream on Netflix I thought that I would brave the inevitable disappointment.But I actually didn't think that it is as bad as the lead reviewers are stating in long winded waffles that any normal person only has limited patience to read.Lets cease with the ramblings of your own inflated self importance and try being concise! (A request I am going to no so ironically break) NO clearly this does not match up to many of the other Marvel films that have been produced in the last ten or so years. I'm not going to hail it as so. BUT... I could see elements of they were trying to do and applaud the effort and refrain from condemning it as 4.4 rating.If M Night Shyamalan can continually make ever so increasingly abysmal offerings that all started with The awfully transparent The Sixth Sense. I fail to see the logic of this rating. I would stay this is far far better than the VAST majority of his films.In a world where Avatar, the worlds dullest amalgamation of tired and overtly mind numbing and stupidly stereotypical monstrosities apparently warrants multiple sequels. I fail to comprehend placing this title below a 5."
" Disappointing
",2017-08-24 00:00:00,2,"I was really looking forwards to watching this new Fantastic Four movie. I did not like the first movies mainly because of the bad casting. But now I can compare with this new one to realize they have taken this franchise up a notch in the bad movies scale.The casting for this movie is atrocious. Casting one of the smallest actors, Jamie Bell (and do not get me wrong, he is a fine actor but not for this role for Christ sake!) for one of the biggest characters in film history, the Thing... What is wrong with these people? And the Human Torch is now a black dude? It is not a racial thing but... Come on! You cannot change like this the main features of the story. The Doctor Doom character looks f*cking ridiculous, his face looks like a bald dorky puppet with funny eyes, not scary at all. Disappointing."
" Oh my god
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,1,"I knew, this was not the best film what I will see. No problem.When I saw the first 10 - 20 minutes I sad wow, I do not understand why this film is so down voted. I thought, this is much more better then the other, more realistic, and it could be better, the introduce of characters was so good, I've except a good film.SPOILERAfter that, they made the machine. So cool. And they just drunk, went into a non secured laboratory, go to another dimension (how the communication works, no explanation how, but forget it, somehow it was happened.)And these drunk kids just went into the most dangerous place of the other dimension, and put their hands into something unknowable. That was the point, when the start (I've bet it to 7.0 points) started to go down, deeper and deeper. I have no words guys, if you do not want to waste your time, skip this film.If you want to see really good junk movie, lets watch Death Race, that is a parody, but this..."
" They could have done so much with this movie
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,2,"As someone who tries giving movies the benefit of the doubt, this movie was, hard to do that with.When I saw the reboot was changing up the Storms backstories, I was interested in seeing the film. I think the casting of Michael B was a good choice and a nice change from Chris Evans Johnny we saw in the first movies and thought his acting was the best of the cast. Unfortunately, the other cast seemed very emotionless in most of their scenes to me. And nobody had any chemistry together.The whole Ben and Reed story they were trying to do could have been great if the actors had more chemistry and it didn't feel so, again, emotionless.One thing I will say I appreciate they tried doing is showing the struggle they had after just transforming and being locked up; but even then they rushed those scenes along with the rest of the movie. The rushed fight against Victor made no sense because they did a terrible job building his relationship with the others unlike the previous installment. I was lost by the story half of the time and I don't think that went away by the end either. It was rushed and all over the place, it makes me sad because they could have done so much with this movie, maybe with a better script and some of the cast replaced it could have been better than first movies (that I personality enjoyed)."
" What was this?!
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,1,-Spoiler Warning-This review contains spoilers so do not read this review if you have not seen this movie!This movie was an utter catastrophe! I was quite looking forward for this movie because I thought it would be enjoyable to watch! Turns out I was wrong! This movie was boring and had nothing interesting in it! It did not even have a fight scene in it! It only had one which was not really good! This movie was just garbage and I do not recommend it to anyone!1/10
" Don't even try
",2017-07-08 00:00:00,1,"It's hard to begin writing a review on Fantastic Four as I could hardly get past the first act of the movie. It was a tragedy of a movie with little story, little character development, and little action. If I could I would give it a 0, as the only reason it deserves a 1 is for its cast, but I feel that would be being too polite on such a bad movie"
" Worst movie in 2015!
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,1,what did I just watch? This is the worst movie of 2015. If you thought fantastic four can not get any worse. YOU HAVE BEEN WRONG. This movie was terrible. The whole movie was boring and just absolute crap. The story made no sense and the story was terrible. I just wasted an 1 hr. and 40 min. of my life. People actually thought for once we would get a good fantastic four movie. But this was the worst Fantastic Four movie. They Keep making reboots because they can not make a good fantastic Four movie. Just look at all of the other fantastic four movies. There ratings are all bad. The comic books of Fantastic Four were so good. But these movies are TERRIBLE! And I loved Fantastic Four the comic books but the movies make me hate it. Marvel needs to just stop making these terrible movies. I don't know how hard it is for Marvel to just make a good Fantastic Four movie.
" Not Deserving of the Hate
",2017-05-25 00:00:00,7,"I didn't expect much and wasn't overly excited to see this, but I thought the trailers made it look cool and I go for the dark, brooding style over the more colorful, hyper style of something like Avengers. Another caveat is that I'm not a comic book purist by any means. If you can stick to the source material and make it good, awesome. But I also fully believe that not everything good in comic form (or any written material) makes a good transfer to film, and even if it's good, some change can make it better. So they made the human torch dude black, or altered this or that event in the storyline. Big f'ing deal, you gd children. It's a comic book - chill. Take all that into consideration I guess when I tell you I'm absolutely stunned at the level of vitriol heaped upon this film. It wasn't great, sure. But I truly have never seen a movie more undeserving of it horrid reputation. Yes, the ending was rushed and you could tell that, yet again, a bunch of studio suits and hacks thought they could put together a film better than real filmmakers. I do believe that Trank's original vision would likely have been great, from what I've heard and from what made it on screen. Even with the studio butchery though, it was more than passably entertaining. Actors were all fine, effects were up to snuff - even the Thing. Story-wise it was the first in a presumed series, so yeah, you expect a lot of set-up - giving back stories, bringing the team together, etc. It's really too bad that there won't be a second. I think what you have here mostly is a case Asperger/Autistic/Borderline Personality Disorder obsessives that have freaked out because it didn't adhere to the source material to the letter, so they complain and then make up all kinds of other invalid reasons to hate it on top of that. I don't care enough to be bogged down by that kind of bs, so I enjoyed it."
" Absolute dreck
",2017-05-20 00:00:00,3,"This movie was painfully bad. The plot, the dialogue, the distorted origin stories: there was virtually nothing good about it. Extremely disappointing. I had hoped for at least a few redeeming bits. The CGI of the alien planet was kind of cool and there was a good but extremely brief scene of the group being sucked up into the air by the dimensional rift- but for 120 million dollars, that was the best they could do? what a waste of time and money!"
" Awful. Just awful.
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,3,"Pretty much nothing about this movie was redeeming. The plot was completely unfathomable, the characters totally flat, acting was pathetic. And it destroyed anything good from the original storyline. Reed was in hiding for a year, and the other 3 became human weapons, enthusiastically?? Fox has never gotten the Fantastic Four, or Dr. Doom, right."
" Good but could have been better.
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,7,"I don't like most comic book movies and really like very few of them. I think most of them deviate far too much from the source material, but, its been apparent that's never going to change. So I am writing this review with that in mind. It was good, but, could have been easily been better.The effects were great, acting was good, but, Dr. Doom's backstory was a bit of a stretch and the movie ending was an ever bigger one. It would seem that the movie was either redone with a different ending or drastically shortened resulting in a hasty denouement."
" The pits
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,2,"I was simply amazed that with all the mass success of Marvel films in general that we actually got a film this awful. This is one of the most reviewed films by Internet critics ever created. I think at least eight people have taken a shot at this, even though some of them weren't technically episodes of their show. You knew the Nostalgia Critic would get to it eventually. So why is this film so horrible? It actually repeats a lot of mistakes the other ones did! It has Doctor Doom being jealous with Reed over Sue and the effects are still bad, especially with Reed's arms.The pacing in this film is among the worst I have ever seen in my life. We are so used to live-action superhero movies being two hours long, you know it would fail with this length. I think it's this length simply because 100 (minutes) is a very nice even number. Oh, this is the fourth Fantastic Four movie and still no good ones! It isn't until halfway through the entire movie that the characters get their superpowers. Even after that, it isn't until four fifths in the movie that we actually see the characters all together! I'm serious! The constant use of darkness is so obnoxious. Why is the Thing naked? In fact, why do they not even use their superhero names until the very end? Even then, only half of them use their names. This film is so soulless with no humor at all as at least the other movies had some light hearted moments. The worst line is probably when Doom says, ""There is no Victor. There is only Doom"". Uh...Victor and Doom are the same person. Everything is horribly rushed in such a boring film. Well, this is the last film for Superhero Month and it's sad we ended on such a bad note. Hopefully, Anime Month will be better! *"
" Three movies now and Hollywood still can't get it right.
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,4,"Poor old Fantastic Four. By some reports, they are among the most popular heroes of the Marvel universe and yet Hollywood still can't provide them with a decent movie, even after three attempts. This one may just be the worse of the bunch. It's not that the acting is bad or the effects are unconvincing. Both are fine. It's just that the writers have failed to provide our heroes with a story that we care about, they haven't created a villain worthy of booing, they haven't created a scenario that has us on the edge of our seats and that we can relate to. Worst of all, they have failed to provide us with heroes we care about and want to cheer for.It's obvious that this movie was planned to be only the first in a franchise and, as such, it's fairly obligatory to include an origin story. Perhaps the failings of this movie would have been rectified in the sequels. Sadly, this movie is done so poorly that I suspect that this will be the last time we see The Fantastic Four on the screen until someone decides to, once again, do a complete reboot.Finally, this movie errs by being pandering to politically correctness. I hate it when writers change established canon by altering a well-known character's gender, race, sexual persuasion or, in fact, any other personal attributes just to score on the politically correct meter. Please don't play with our memories like that.Thankfully, this movies is just over 90 minutes long. Maybe if it was longer - as most similar movies are - it would have had time to remedy some of the things I have complained about. Somehow, I think not."
" Wow
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,3,"This is already 4 movie about a fairly well-known team. The first came out in the early 90's turned out to be a cheap passing film which even on big screens was not allowed. Then, in the middle of the zero ones, another film was released, which was a rebut. Later released a sequel. In those days, I liked them. Having looked them over again, I realized that these are average, rather funny pictures.It's 2015 now. We were shown pretty steep trailers, gloomy, in the spirit of science fiction, looked good.And then the movie came out. Immediately, a barrage of negativity poured into him. Both from critics and from the audience. The film suffered a devastating failure, collecting a little more than its budget. At first I thought that this was again a through the grapevine, critics as always smell and so on. And I myself watched the movie. And all this criticism proved to be justified. The film is very weak. In all. Literally everything in him is bad. Now I will try to explain why this movie I think is bad.Usually the plot in such films is not in the first place. Usually blockbusters compensate with this action, humor, interesting characters. But there is nothing in this film.The effects themselves are very messy. Everything is done very cheaply. It would seem that the budget of 160 million dollars? Remember how a Thing tossed a tank, comments unnecessarily.The action in the film is almost nonexistent. He is in the finals, but he is poorly delivered and very short.The music is scarce. Sometimes it happens that a good soundtrack can make a movie floor. Well, at least give an epic and an atmosphere. Similar films I think should not be given, and so it is clear. Immediately the music is not remembered at all.The plot as I wrote is not particularly fashionable to criticize in such films, but still he is very trivial and smells of idiocy. I heard that the film was cut, changed, heard about the scandal. But we have what we have, there will not be a director's version. We have a very boring movie, with a stupid story line and a bad script. The tape is very boring.The actors played medium. The characters themselves do not develop at all. The script is so wretched that they decided to send the guys to another world because of drinking. The guys were just drunk. All.Here at last our heroes get beyond the ability. How do you think, what will happen next? A year later, a fantasy on the run, the rest help the military. That is, we do not show how the characters acquire the ability, how they live with it. It was just scored. The very nature of the characters are also strange. They do not develop at all.In this film there are a lot of dialogues, they are absolutely senseless.I do not want to say that this is the worst worst film in the world, but it's frankly very bad. And as a blockbuster, and as a regular film at times. But I still liked something. I liked the first 20 minutes of the film, this part is quite interesting. And then unfortunately went the pun that I wrote above."
" Laughably bad
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,2,"This movie made the the 2005 version and its sequel look like Inception! I have rarely seen such appalling acting, terrible writing and poor storytelling all wrapped into one movie. Miles Teller, promising in Whiplash, was painful to watch and yet he still managed to be one of the better performers in this poor excuse for a movie. We essentially see an origins story for 1 hour 25 minutes and then a 5 minute 'fight' at the end. Dr Doom was portrayed pretty terribly, not helped by the fact that we didn't see him until the movie had just 14 minutes to go. Compared to its two predecessors, which were charming, entertaining and humorous (albeit not perfect), this movie falls way, way short of every mark.Don't see it!"
" Boring and missing the point
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,3,"For the first half of the movie nothing really happens, then the four get their powers and Doom gets lost in the other dimension, then still nothing happens, then Doom casually kills everybody on the base, then there's the final showdown, and the movie ends. Rather boring, and I say that it really misses the point of a superhero movie."
" Liked it but
",2017-03-22 00:00:00,6,"It was cool and all, I have always loved super heroes since I was a little kid in the 70s reading most the comic books. I've been waiting decades for them to finally get around to making some of the movies they have today like the Avengers and soon Justice League, I of course wanted to see those on the big screen when I was little. But now that we're finally getting all these super hero movies I'm not complaining. I would've rather they made Fantastic Four part 3 instead of this one but I know how it goes most the time in Hollywood.Anyway I finally got around to watching this one a few days ago and I thought it was okay but it was a big let down. Basically another origin story and I did enjoy most of it until the big fight at the end. Very disappointed they have the big fight on the foreign planet and it really wasn't even that big of a fight. I think if the ending was done a little bit better I would've liked it even more. Regardless it was just kind of bland / plain. It really was nothing to get excited over and nothing to get upset over. It made me think of one of those kids you knew back in school who were there daily, they didn't talk much, you kind of saw them around but you really didn't know them."
" Not too bad - entertaining and realistic
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,8,"I was watching it at the fitness and thought I had already seen it (I saw the 2005 one) and was unsure if it is really a movie about Fantastic Four or another movie. I was waiting (for a long while) to see when they would get their powers and there were some mismatch from what I know about Fantastic Four in earlier movies. I remembered Reed being older and it didn't click to me immediately that Johnny is going to be different and Sue is not American? I thought the dialogue was a bit too simple. But past all that, I couldn't stop watching the movie (and stopped my workout instead). The simple scenes like Johnny and Reed's failed fist bump or Reed ignoring Victor's accusations of love in the office, show Reed's character. How the characters were feeling when the transformation took place were quite real. It wasn't something they would immediately embrace but need to go through some training. It was a fun and realistic movie. Though i didn't get to watch in the end, I definitely think it deserves more stars and would watch the sequel."
" Worst Boss Fight Ever
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,3,"Marvel should think about movies are not TV series. There is a difference between them. TV series and movie have big difference. This movie like a first episode of TV series and they just added 30 sec. horrible boss fight end of it for show this is movie. When this movie over, i was waited for second part or something. I told what was that? Movie? I spend my time for that? Really Marvel? We know they love money but Marvel is makes more worst movies each year. Please stop release too much horrible movies and try to make good one. So please don't make Logan bad too. You have less good movie series and don't make them bad like that too.."
" One of the worst superhero movies
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,2,"Fantastic? Absolutely not! Director Josh Trank's intention may have been good, but he didn't make it effectively, and the result is disastrous and delivering one of the worst superhero movies ever made, which is a pity, because his previous film ""Chronicle"" is amazing. This Fantastic Four has a plot of 1h30min totally unavailable without any memorable scene with the final fight breathless and shameful. The visual effects are painful and poorly done, despite its budget of $120 million. The performances are disastrous, it seems that the actors did not want to be there. The saddest of all: it's the fourth film ever made of this team, but they don't learn from the mistakes and continue to make silly and depressing movies of the most beloved comic book heroes."
