" I like how they mixed a ____ movie and a psychological thriller
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,8,"The ending does not ruin the movie, It is just something you dont expect, and that what makes it good. The whole film you ask one question is he really crazy or not? but at the end you ask yourself where did this come from? even if it is a bit stupid, but these kind of movies :i am talking about the final part ( im not saying what kind not to spoil), to me they all stupid and watching the whole movie of that ""kind"" is not of my interest. This movie in fact is a nice thriller that keeps you on your toes"
" One of the creepiest sci-fi horrors out there
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,9,"This movie keeps you on edge with its vague mystery and conflict, unpredictable characters, uncomfortable plot, and claustrophobic atmosphere. It's very hard to make such an affective 100 minute movie in such a small space almost the whole movie, but this film does it so well in an anxiety inducing and uncertain way. The main cast's performance was great and the characters were believable. The ending was odd but the movie was still so scary and memorable."
" Almost great but not quite
",2021-03-11 00:00:00,6,"The ending is painfully disappointing. I must admit, overall I quite enjoyed the film. So much so that I hadn't even realised it was 2 hours long. My eyes were stuck to the screen throughout, truly gripping stuff. I was emotionally invested with all the characters and the mystery was wonderfully implemented. The antagonist was portrayed just right, in a way that made me hate and fear him just the right amount. But god damn that ending left me wanting more, so much more. I don't know, maybe it was the psychological thriller-ish themes that geared me up for a more thorough , intimate ending , one which would make me exhale with relief or even chuckle in some dark humour kind of way but nope. The ending ruined the film."
" Quite possibly the best film you'll never see
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,9,"This film is incredible, despite being less well known than it deserves. Knife edge tension captivated you from the very start, and the film cleverly builds the terrifying plots tension to a peak, with a surprising (No spoilers!) ending, and an incredible performance from the whole cast, 10 Cloverfield lane is absolutely worth your time, and ignore the 15 ratings. If your kid is 12 and can handle other thrillers (for instance Tenet) they should be fine with this, the only reason it's a 15 is one F bomb right at the end and a few gory scenes. Enjoy!"
" Fantastic movie with a sloppy sloppy ending..
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,5,"The suspense build up, mystery everything was great till first one and half hour... the last 10 minutes the disappointment... i was expecting a completely diff climax.. oh no th end is totally ruined..."
" 10 stars for '10 Cloverfield Lane'
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,10,"The very first trailer I saw for '10 Cloverfield Lane' had my undivided attention. It gave the suggestion of something bad happening on the surface, a happy-go-lucky vibe in the bunker, and a sudden dire turn of events, all set to Tommy and the Shondells' classic ""I think we're alone now."" Even the unassuming poster has an ominous air to it.The full-length film not only lives up to the expectations I'd had, but also far exceeds them. Like too many movies, it took me a while to catch up on something I'd missed, but now I can't do without.The vibe of the trailer is drawn out over 103 minutes, with even more tension and suspense mixed in. We have a few minutes of exposition before Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) abruptly finds herself an apparent captive in Howard's (John Goodman) bunker, with only the hapless Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) for additional company. The shock and terror of the immediate scenario gives way to resignation and acceptance when Michelle tries to get away, only to learn just how desperate the situation is.From there we get more twists in the rocky relationship between the three survivors, culminating in a riveting climax that itself deserves some discussion. After the thrills and character interactions earlier on the movie, it would have been all too easy for '10 Cloverfield Lane' to fall flat at its conclusion. What exactly happened on the surface to force these three underground? The reveal of such a mystery in itself has been the downfall of some stories, let alone the nature of such an unseen peril, and following on 'Cloverfield,' it would be natural to assume there's a direct tie to the 2008 monster movie. What we get is another grave threat as Michelle leaps from the frying pan and into the fire, and the thrills keep coming right up until the very, very end.For all the moments of action, atmosphere, and outright chills, the bulk of '10 Cloverfield Lane' is devoted to the story of three people in an underground bunker, and as such relies on its cast to propel the narrative. I can't fault Gallagher at all, yet he is far outshone by Winstead and Goodman: both put in absolutely stellar performances.John Goodman hardly needs an introduction after a long acting career, but he continues nonetheless to surprise again and again. Even his most surly characters somehow give off an aura of warmth - yet warmth can be either comforting, or smothering. Meanwhile, no matter how inviting and friendly Winstead's roles may be, there's always a certain intensity and determination to her that is impossible to ignore. Both actors readily embody Howard and Michelle with these traits, and that dynamic between Goodman and Winstead here is fascinating to watch unfold. Gallagher performs admirably as he manages to deftly navigate the space between, providing a bit of balance.Every step along the way, the music helps to maintain the atmosphere. Tight editing suggests the passage of time for us in a setting where there's generally no obvious day/night cycle. Practical and special effects are spot on, as are the choices in props and the very set, all coming together to make this story very believable.I can't believe it took me as long as it did to catch up, but at the same time, this is a movie that's worth the wait. The basic premise of '10 Cloverfield Lane' may not be quite up everyone's alley, but I'd be hard-pressed not to recommend this to anyone. It's just that good.If you've seen either 'Cloverfield' and/or 'The Cloverfield Paradox' and were less than enthused, but haven't yet watched '10 Cloverfield Lane,' don't give up just yet. The middle child is a very different feature from either of its siblings, and in my mind is absolutely the best of the three. It's a solid, thrilling film from start to finish, boasting a tight narrative anchored by great performances.Don't miss out!"
" Great movie almost ruined by the ending.
",2021-02-22 00:00:00,6,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It kept delivering and delivering, so when the final 20 minutes or so played out, I was just as much on the edge of my seat as the middle of the movie. But it ended up being a sloppy mess of an end.Aliens??!!Seriously, aliens?!This would have been my favorite movies. The antagonist was supposed to be Howard. And then the aliens show up on screen, and suddenly nothing is creepy any more. It lost all intensity.It still deserves a 6/10 because I did enjoy the majority of the film, and I would recommend this for others - just prepare to be disappointed by the ending."
" Superb!
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,10,"10 Cloverfield Lane is a 2016 Hollywood movie directed by Dan Trachtenberg. The movie is about a man who saves a girl who was in an accident. He lets her stay in his bunker to save her from the alien attack. But his behavior makes her uncomfortable.With a runtime of 1 hour and 45 minutes, this movie will cling on to your attention till the very last scene. Every transition in the scenes are smooth and you won't doubt anything or will doubt as much as Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) does. The unsettling atmosphere of the bunker which lightens up a bit at times and then again gets tensed will keep you on the edge of your seat. Also, Michelle's constant planning to get out of the bunker to check the outside world for herself will keep you guessing about the alien attack.John Goodman as the survival specialist and Mary Elizabeth Winstead as the ever-sceptical girl are a treat to watch. Also the soundtrack is apt and engaging.Lastly, do watch it! You won't regret it."
" Pretty Good Claustrophobic Horror
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,8,"There were a few plot twists here and there that surprised me and felt like a B-Movie version of Lovecraftian horror (at the end) and the rest of the movie being entrapped psychological horror. It's quite good if you find my description enticing but if you don't like psychological horror or thriller you'll hate this film.10 Cloverfield Lane is a better film than Cloverfield from a purely technical, horror and academic review of the film. However by my own mind, Cloverfield (2008) is a far more entertaining film because of how unique it's method of capture was and the monster element within it. I had a big problem with the antagonist(s) I won't tell you how many antagonists there are or it may be considered a spoiler in 10 Cloverfield Lane. The design of the antagonist is my main problem with the film versus it's predecessor. We follow our protagonist Michelle as she lives through a short tumultuous relationship with a crazed psychopath named Howard and a redneck nobody named Emmett.Overall I'll give it a 8/10 despite its flaws; for the low budget and it's unexpected and sudden release 10 Cloverfield Lane deserves credit for actually being quite a unique film I haven't seen before. Trust me you should give this a try, it's not for everyone but even as someone who hates these types of films I still had a half decent time with it. Especially because the female protagonist reminded me of a more sexy just as competent Sigourney Weaver hero so that's an instant point in my book albeit the movie has a far less menacing monster.P. S. The ending of the film was exactly what happened like 2/3rds of the way through War of the World kinda unervy, wonder if they stole that idea from there. I'm mentioning that fact because I watched War of the Worlds a week before seeing 10 Cloverfield Lane. Sorry not part of the rest of my review just thought I would add that in just in case someone saw the similarity as well."
" doomsday
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,8,"The twisted plot is amazing and movie will keep you hooked all the time with a new events that will come to light without even anticipating anything.the performance of the actors is great.Well-written, well-played, well-developed"
" How could anyone enjoy this movie?
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,1,"It was like they were making it up as they went. And got totally lost.
It tries to be too many things and fails to be anything but predictable.
A trite medly of the most hack concepts and portrayals of the psychological thriller and post apocalypse genres.
Stands out as one of the absolute worst movies I've seen in years."
" Really good film
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,8,"Been wanting to watch this for a while and now it's on Netflix I've had the chance.
I had read that it's only linked to the original cloverfield by name and that's true (kind of).
Really well worked film with a twist, which you expect but then kind of think isn't coming, until it does, but then you question the twist based on what you have seen and then you want to know more.
John Goodman is brilliant and his acting lends to what the story wants you to think of his character.Really good stuff."
" I love films that keep you guessing
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,9,"Did he , didn't he ? Is it true , or not ?
A disturbing John Goodman is terrifying and sickening, not for the faint hearted
Guessing the end is not easy. No tricks employed . That bits fun
Whether you'll enjoy it comes down to whether you like being seriously creeped out by the clearly disturbed Goodman who does it too well . Made me feel like a child again with my stepfather waiting in the dark and hoping nobody else is looking ..."
" The ending confused me
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,7,Was it meant to end like that? A bit of an anti-climax.
" Masterpiece!!
",2021-02-07 00:00:00,10,It's a deserved masterpiece which will keep you on edge till the end.First class acting by entire cast and crew.A must watch movie for everyone.
" Tries to be interesting, but fails big time
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,3,"Many of the reviews even the ones which are critical are dumb because instead of focusing on what's essential they start blathering on and on nonsensically. This movie tries in the beginning to make you believe that the conspiracy theorist guy is a nutcase, but then some elements emerge that actually he's not, he may be telling the truth... but then they make you start doubting again... and in the end we discover that he was not that crazy... but he was also in some other way... (i feel vomiting it was so poor)... so they tried to make it as an unexpected surprise ending but it's practically rubbish, something at 10 year-old could write better. Sad."
" Ok but bad endings make or break a movie
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,6,"Watched this and felt that it had to feature 'clover', wrong.The majority was suspenseful and decent but the ending was bad.If they explained aliens earlier in the movie then it would be ok.If she got out the bunker and saw a decimated place with no aliens that would be ok.But you cant market a movie with cloverfield and not have the monster. That's why so many watched it.In my opinion, she should of go out the bunker, got in the car and the clover should be seen . But soooooo, we'll use a stupid cucumber looking alien. And a float ship!!!!Cloverfield paradox is the same a bad movie but at least they threw in the monster for .01 seconds"
" Not what it seems.
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,9,"A great movie. Well acted, interesting and believable characters with a nice twist."
" Great entertainment and surprises
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,8,Thought I had this one all figured out until the last 10 minutes! Great job being creepy by John Goodman ! I wish we could have seen a bit more at the end but I really enjoyed it.
" ATROCIOUS
",2021-01-12 00:00:00,2,This film to appear to be a diversion or a game of manipulation on the part of the director is in fact a complete lack of consistency. The film does not go in any specific direction. Let's not even talk about this ending that ruins the whole story. The ending is just ridiculous.
" Hitchcock would be proud.
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,9,"Wow! 10 Cloverfield Lane was the most intense psychodrama I have seen.Stuck in a bomb shelter with a guy who is maybe psycho ... or maybe not. Definitely at least a bit eccentric, to put it nicely, but it takes a bit of a nut to build a shelter like that in the first place. Maybe it takes being a nutjob to survive. Or maybe you are in Bates Motel. You just can't tell.The acting is top-notch. Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is a master of angst. Every sidelong glance, every hesitant start, every fibre of her screams get me out of this weird nightmare! We can easily understand why she is freaked out, but maybe her character is oversensitive that way. Like everything in this movie, you just can't tell what is real.And Howard (John Goodman) ... Howard! Hahaha! They got the best guy for this part. I want to watch it again just to savour his performance. He out-psychoed Bates by a long mile. He is obviously dangerous and on a hair trigger, but he wants - demands - a frightening normalcy. You feel like he is on lithium but maybe needs to adjust the dose. He is like the Sea Wolf of Jack London. Interesting thought, I wonder how it would have worked to make Howard philosophical? But that just wouldn't be Howard. Absolute favourite scene? Howard dancing to celebrate success, oblivious to his two prisoners' extreme tension, just inches away from him on either side. Or was it the Little Women and Santa Claus scene? ... haha, what a nut! That game scene was brilliant. That was when we knew beyond a doubt that he was crazy. And then changing it up with dessert before dinner, at such a time! These are some of the things, and more, that nailed its ranking with Hitchcock's psychodramas.Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.) was extremely enigmatic at first. A down-homey guy. His cheerful normalcy was suspicious. Was he in cahoots with Howard? Was his story of coming to the shelter worth anything? We just didn't know. I think the contrast between him and Howard might be his biggest contribution to the movie. He didn't seem to grasp the magnitude of danger he was messing with, by constantly needling Howard. It didn't take too long to figure out he was going to get it, and the only question was when and how. But still it was a shocking surprise.I wasn't crazy about the end, but think of it. If the whole thing was just a fake, wouldn't that be predictable? Aside from the mysterious woman at the door earlier. So, in the end, even in the last few minutes, this movie is full of surprises. Ha ... Howard was wrong! No, HE WAS RIGHT!!! The entire movie is like that. A mystery, a real psychodrama, and a rollercoaster from start to finish. Hitchcock would be proud!"
" Unnecessary ending
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,6,I really loved this movie just not upon the ending it was the most unique way to ruin a perfectly good movie
" Stop watching 10 mins before the end
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,5,"Don't waste your time finishing the film, just stop it maybe 10 minutes before the end and create a resolution in your mind, it will undoubtedly be better than the ending of the actual film"
" 8
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,8,"It was really nice and interesting movie. Imdb and metascore stand good but why there are so many negative comments. Everyone is complaining about the ending but the only aspect I didn't like was the beginning. It wasn't said why she decided to leave her boyfriend, where she's going, does she have family and etc. That's the main errors in this film. The main plot was not overcomplicated,easy to watch, I liked all those 3 main characters acting. The ending wasn't bad too. It wasn't very hard to predict that something is happening outside the world and that fat guy is telling the truth but he's just a little bit crazy one. If you have free time, give it a shot. It won't be scary movie more like action with some spicies."
" 10 Cloverfield Lane
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,8,Awesome buildup and pacing. The chase scene at the end had me on the edge of my seat.
" Superb!
",2020-12-13 00:00:00,7,"Very good story,acting,setting and atmosphere ,all in all a nice evening spent)"
" Decent mystery except the ending
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,6,It would have been solid 8 or 9 if it wasn't for the ending. Except that it was quite an intense mystery.
" Makes a change
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,8,I liked it you dont expect the ending i was surprised with it it makes a change to watch a film like this !
" A knockout
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,8,"A tense, smart and unpredictable roller coaster.Trachtenberg aces the direction keeping us on our toes in every perfectly done sequence. His Hitchcockian reveals of information are note perfect cinema of show don't tell. After this, he's gonna be doing big big movies. But he shined in the tricky confines of this one.The script is a tightly tuned suspense machine that never lets us know for sure what we can trust. But it always plays fair and does what the best scripts do: have the characters make intelligent, capable choices.Goodman gives a great performance that I can't say much about. And Gallagher also kills it but the truth is Mary Winstead is movie star amazing. I mean, she's a wonder. Doesn't hurt that her heroine is one of the best heroes in recent memory: resourceful, intelligent and vulnerable. Perfect melding of material and actress.I smiled from ear to ear. When that first title pops up, I knew it was gonna be a good one.We can quibble about the ending action. But I'm on board for stuff like that. But I can see how it might lose some people.Why aren't all movies this smart and entertaining???? I mean, this is how you do it."
" Best sci-fi thriller movie ever made! Best movie of 2016
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie is incredible, it deserve more recognition. John Goodman's performance is what made this movie so good! One of my favorite movies of all time. I bought on DVD in March 2020. Cloverfield Paradox was bad in my opinion. I wanted to see more of Howard Stambler in this movie about his story. Too bad he had to die at the end. I give this 10/10. Outstanding movie!!!"
" survival
",2020-11-20 00:00:00,6,"If you are not a claustrophobic person and have not become one during this year 2020 and if your escapist entertainments these days include horror movies you can try '10 Cloverfield Lane' (2016) directed by Dan Trachtenberg. It is the director's first feature film and the only one that he has released on screens so far, but it is a remarkable debut under the careful producer guidance of J.J. Abrams. As in most films produced by Abrams, unexplained phenomena take place and the suspicion of extraterrestrial intervention hovers over this film, but the way the story is told makes us change our perspective all the time and wonder what we actually see on screen. Even the surprising final part, which some will like and others will like less, does not explain everything. The questions will continue to concern the viewers even after the screening of the film ends.The three heroes of the film find themselves together in an underground bunker, after what seems to have been a catastrophic event that made life on the surface of the Earth impossible or dangerous, at least for a while. The air outside seems polluted, and our heroes are among the few survivors. Howard (John Goodman) has been building the bunker for years preparing precisely for such an event, because he is an adept of conspiracy theories and a survivalist. Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), his younger neighbor, took refuge in the bunker in the aftermath of the disaster. Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) got there by hazard (or maybe not), following a car accident caused by Howard, who also saved her life. In the conditions of seclusion and isolation, the dynamics of the relations between the three characters will also develop with them, or rather with the young woman's vision of the situation, because we, the viewers, see the story from her perspective. Does Howard tell the truth? What role does Emmett play - is he a friend or an enemy? Is this a true extraordinary situation or a pretext for a kidnapping? What really happened outside? An attack with atomic or chemical weapons? The invasion of an enemy army? An alien invasion? Or maybe nothing really happened? As spectators, together with Michelle, we will often change our points of view.The movie works very well most of the time. It's helped by the good acting, especially by John Goodman whom the role fits wonderfully, and by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, an actress that I also noticed and liked in season 3 of the Fargo series, which was distributed a year after this movie. The sets, both the bunker that creates a sensation that combines claustrophobia with a feeling of hesitating security as none of the heroes knows exactly what is happening outside, and the few scenes filmed outside, manage to create an atmosphere of tension, amplified by the soundtrack. Most horror and sci-fi fans will be pleased. '10 Cloverfield Lane' does not try to shock excessively or cross the limits of the genre, but skillfully combines familiar elements and themes and manages to provide more than reasonable entertainment."
" Waste
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,1,"Sucks and waste of time, so much suspense and nothing worth it, I regret watching this movie, unrelated"
" extremely original and expertly constructed thriller
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,10,"I was caught off guard and really surprised at just how good this film is. After a fast and puzzling beginning we are thrust within the confines of an underground bunker, more or less, for the duration of the film - and that's good. There are surprises throughout but the fact that a sensationally good film can be made with a small cast and limited locations should not be one of them. Tight, believable and always second guessing the viewer, this is a most impressive thriller. I cannot remember another film that has caught me by surprise or had be as tense for a long time. John Goodman is not just good but sensationally so as he flips back and forth in manner and has us as caught off guard as the other protagonists. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a revelation and clearly set for great things. Much is seen through her eyes and she reflects our concern and confusion interrupted with sudden bursts of action and innovation that startle. We can never relax and whenever we are tempted to and feel we have the measure of things, we are confounded with further action. John Gallagher Jr is more or less the foil for the other two but does well and his seeming lack of contribution is deceptive as his early lack of overt action against their captor adds to our confusion as to whether Mr Goodman is a goodie or a baddie in this extremely original and expertly constructed thriller. As a postscript I would add that the innovative ending does not disappoint Full marks."
" Great movie
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,8,It was really a gripping movie and the plot twist is awesome love john Goodman!
" What just happened?
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,2,"One of those movies that builds and builds, then derails into a WTF ending. This movie kept you wondering with the stories it was building but all those stories become pointless and unanswered by the end. Have no idea why so many good ratings. Maybe because John Goodman's acting was great."
" Missed opportunities
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,6,"This movie could have been so much better. First, the beginning of the movie was probably not needed because it didn't tie into the ending. The film became a whole other story after the beginning. I thought the bunker scene was fine. But then you get to the scene, after she escapes the bunker, and she manages to destroy this huge spaceship - unbelievable! And then she drives off to fight the aliens. I mean, are we dealing with a woman scorned, because of a break-up, and now she's a GI Jane?It begs the question, what was this movie really about? Who was this emotionally hurt woman, turned heroin? Why wasn't her ex more involved in the film so that maybe there would be more insight into the her character? However, I guess it was okay for a one time watch. I will give the filmakers credit for keeping you interested until the end. The frustrating part of it is, it was an unsatisfying ending for me."
" Fallout Shelter
",2020-10-30 00:00:00,7,"I know others will say this also, the movie should have ended when she got out of the shelter. This was a sold movie until adding in the aliens of the first movie. John Goodman is a wonderful villain. I loved how I just wanted her to escape, yet you cant trust the air outside. So many times my mind would shift back and forth that its smart to escape and then trust John Goodman. Once Michelle escapes the fallout shelter, and the aliens come I was disappointed. Killed a great movie."
" Final fantasy
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,5,You cand destroy an alien navy with a bottle of wine...
" Enjoyed the Movie
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,9,"The movies starts with voice of Ben (Bradley Cooper) on Phone trying to convince Michelle to return. From then on, the movie is only full of suspense and mystery. I am a fan of mystery thriller movies and this kept me watching until the ending. The ending was a bit of a twist from what anyone would expect and also disappointing. The way the movie portrays how Michelle, Emmett, Howard think during a crisis is for what i really appreciate the movie. There are twists, doubts, sentiments, positive thinking which keeps the movie thrilling.
Must watch."
" 10 Cloverfield Lane
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,7,"The original Cloverfield is a ""found footage"" movie, his next instalment is only a literal sequel, and one that was rated well by critics, produced by J.J. Abrams (Lost, Super 8, Star Trek, Star Wars). Basically, after breaking up with her fiancé Ben (Bradley Cooper), Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) packs up and leaves New Orleans. Whilst driving through rural Louisiana at night, the radio reports blackouts in several cities, before her car is hit by an oncoming truck, causing her to crash and knocking her unconscious. When she wakes, Michelle finds herself in a locked room with bedding and her foot chained to a pipe. A man enters the room and introduces himself as Howard (John Goodman), explaining they are in bunker beneath his farm about forty miles from Lake Charles. He claims he found her after her crash in a ditch and saved her life. He also tells her that the air outside is radiated by a nuclear or chemical agent following a recent ""attack."" Michelle attempts to escape when she gets the opportunity, but he calms her down. She is taken on a tour of the bunker, and meets another survivor, Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.). Howard shows that the bunker is well-stocked, with plenty of food and drink, fresh water, and games, puzzles, and DVDs for entertainment. But Michelle is still suspicious of her predicament, until Emmett shows her the bunker's entrance. From the window, she sees two dead and decayed pigs as evidence of the fallout. She also sees and recognises Howard's truck as the one that drove her off the road. She privately relays her concerns about Howard's motivations to Emmett, but he dismisses them and says he witnessed the attack himself. He was not abducted but rather sought Howard's help voluntarily. During their first dinner together, Michelle creates a situation to incite Howard's rage, during which she steals his keys and runs to the hatch to escape. As she goes to open the door, however, she sees a car approaching, and from it a woman (Suzanne Cryer) appears with facial lesions, beating the window and begging to be let inside. Terrified, and convinced by Howard, Michelle backs away from the door, returning to the bunker and leaving the woman to her fate. Howard opens up about his daughter, who he says is ""not with us anymore."" Slowly, Michelle, Emmett and Howard bond together, playing games and eating together. Howard enlists Michelle for help, as she is small enough to fit through the vents, to fix the air-filtration unit when it fails. While repairing it, she finds a locked skylight with the word ""HELP"" scratched on the inside of the glass. Michelle and Emmett discover that Howard's purported daughter was a young girl who had gone missing about two years earlier, and they suspect he abducted her. They make plans to escape, secretly creating a makeshift hazmat (hazardous materials) suit. When Howard discovers that tools and parts are missing, he accuses them of stealing them, and threatens to immerse them in a barrel of perchloric acid. Emmett takes responsibility, claiming that he was building a weapon so that Michelle would respect him. Howard pulls his gun and kills Emmett. He tries to comfort Michelle, telling her that he killed Emmett to protect her. In shock, Michelle makes final preparations to leave. Howard surprises her, but she manages to flee with the suit. On the way, she knocks over the barrel of acid, which causes an electrical fire in the bunker and Howard is given serious chemical burns. Michelle manages to escape just in time before the perchloric acid explodes, destroying the bunker and killing Howard. Michelle puts on the suit and escapes the burning bunker. There is a moment where she tears the leg of her suit, and panics that she will be infected by contamination, but manages to seal the tear with tape. However, moments later, she sees signs of living wildlife, and takes the risk of removing her helmet, and is relieved to breathe clean air. But then she suddenly sees a giant biomechanical alien spacecraft, drawn by the bunker explosion. A quadrupedal creature drops from the craft and chases Michelle, forcing her to hide in the farm shed. She races towards the farmhouse, but the craft appears and emits a green gas that forces Michelle back into the suit. Alien machinery from the ship capture her, but she grabs a bottle of whisky and creates a makeshift petrol bomb to throw into the ship. The fire created destroys the ship, causing it to crash and she is released. After recovering, she takes the dead woman's car and escapes. As she nears the Texas border, she hears a radio announcement instructing any survivors to head to Baton Rouge to evacuate. But she also hears a request for anyone with medical or combat training to come to Houston to help. She pauses for a moment of which option to take, before driving off in the direction of Houston. In the distance, two larger alien spaceships can be seen in the sky. Also starring Douglas M. Griffin as Driver, Sumalee Montano as Voice on Radio, and Frank Mottek as Radio Broadcaster. Winstead is terrific as the incarcerated young woman trying to find a way out, Goodman is fantastic as the menacing man claiming he can protect those surviving with him, and Gallagher Jr. is good as the other survivor. It does not really matter if you don't know the events of the original Cloverfield, this is a completely different kettle of fish. It is all about the paranoia, as the lead character doesn't know what to believe being underground and how to react to the upcoming dangers, it is a twisting and riveting science-fiction psychological thriller. Very good!"
" The ending was so unnecessary
",2020-10-10 00:00:00,3,"This film is the epitome of the meme: ""I'm not saying it was aliens...but it was aliens.""The ridiculous turn this film takes it the last 10 minutes completely ruins an otherwise pretty tense and gripping psychological thriller.
Typical of Abrams to categorically mess up an ending though, so i shouldn't have been too surprised in all honesty.This film done everything right in terms of keeping you on edge, building tension and keeping you guessing. You feel just as confused and vulnerable as the protagonist and have no idea where everything is leading. But then, out of nowhere, it suddenly takes a sharp turn down towards wtf-ville and completely kills everything that it worked hard to build over the duration of the film.So unnecessary. So many different ways they could have wrapped it up, but they took the most ludicrous root."
" Wow.
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,9,"I have not been so excited watching a movie in as long as I can remember.
Psychological, thrilling, and horrifying, this film brings you face-to-face with your preconceptions and constantly challenges what you think you know.
Absolutely brilliant."
" Just really good
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,10,"In the chair until the last minute. When you think you know what happened, you don't really know."
" The worst movie I have ever wached
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,1,Why there is not in descriprion that is science fiction movie. They discovered nothing at the end. What hapend with those girls on the pics.
" Stupid movie
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,1,"Waste of time.
Don't even want to write a review 😊."
" Great, but then the end comes
",2020-09-18 00:00:00,5,"It was a very decent movie, but unfortunately the last ten minutes ruin it all. I didn't even know that was possible. But hell yeah, it is.
Not worth it, it's just frustrating.
I'd love to joke about how truly horrible the ending is, but I respect that you don't want spoilers. That's the only reason. But do yourself a favor and don't watch it anyways."
" Good movie
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,8,"It started off great, with a lot of suspense and all. I loved the movie but i think the ending was a but unrealistic and could have been better. Although great writing and directing alongwith acting."
" A bad ending.
",2020-09-12 00:00:00,6,It was a good begining & I was expecting some twists and turns at the end. But what I saw did not satisfy me.
" Two thumbs up
",2020-08-08 00:00:00,8,"The movie was really good. The script and acting was great. I felt like all the events fit nicely and when everything is revealed, just works. The small seeds planted throughout shows how well written and planned out the script was. You don't get that things were forced feeling."
" Gripping thriller
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,7,"What does this have to do with Cloverfield? There's only a small easter egg to tie the franchise together and it feels desperate and manipulative. As a film by itself, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a gripping thriller where we are not always sure what is going on or who to trust. It feels like a very paranoid situation and this really comes across. However, the ending answered the questions too explicitly and devolved into an action scene from War of the Worlds (2005) which was a totally daft tonal shift."
" cloverfield or nah?
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,7,Good film and of course john goodman absolutely steals the show. there's a pretty jarring shift to cap off the movie that could make or break it for a lot of folks. i'm ok with it. it's entertaining and tense
" Too bad about the ending.
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,7,"An unstable John Goodman or hostile aliens? Let me think about it... again. Locked in a underground bunker with an unstable John Goodman or on the surface trying to keep one step ahead of hostile aliens? Talk about being caught between a rock and a hard place. After much consideration you might take the chance with the latter threat, after you realise just how intense a game of charades can be.""10 CLOVERFIELD LANE"" is a confined and agonising character driven thriller that cleverly feeds off the uncertainty of the situation and the interplay of its characters. Working in its favour is how they filmed it, like you're actually riding it out in the bunker alongside those inside. Feeling every sense of emotions streaming from the trio. Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr really do hold you there with very good performances. Both their characters are adapt and affably brought across. But you just can't go passed the powerhouse acting of John Goodman. It's a tailored performance of pure manipulation and embodying unease. As for the last 10 minutes, it was serviceable but disappointing compared to the impressive build-up that had gone before it."
" Like Icarus, They Flew Too Close To The Sun
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,7,"Im simply going to start with, wow. 10 Cloverfield Lane was beautiful.
This is a movie which at base evokes raw emotion. The senses of betrayal, anxiety, helplessness, loss, grief and of-course the gnawing feeling of suffocation and claustrophobia forces the audience to sweat throughout the movie. Which i find amazing, being able to play the audience the way the movie did. The focus through was building atmosphere and creating ambiguity. The viewers take the first portion trying to make sense of what is happening and when they believe they have figured everything out, the rug is swept from under in one smooth motion, leaving the viewer again struggling to understand what is true and what is not. The entire runtime kept the audience on the edge of their seats, from one strange turn to another.
Director Dan Trachtenberg does a great job creating a tense environment where every moment is one to be wary of. Not without giving credit to the incredible screenplay writers and of course the brilliant cast, John Goodman (Howard) , Mary Elizabeth Winstead (Michelle) and John Gallagher Jr. (Emmett). All of who bring an irreplaceable role to the movie, which actually earned each of them awards. The characters each are built and developed beautifully, with the continued air of ambiguity. This makes a death scene truly impactful, which is rare. Imagery, intricately detailed sets and props aid the film greatly, from well placed blood smears to single screws being misplaced, which in turn make the characters seem all the more real. These characters become so well developed that the audience feels true emotion for them, invested in them.
I believe however, the true pulling point for 10 Cloverfield Lane, would be the complete circumstantial ambiguity, the sheer uncertainty of the truth, blatantly baring the power of informational clarity.
Unfortunately this movie which is built underground did not really have a place for the sci-fi, Cloverfield content. Which felt unnecessary at the end of the film, trying to achieve too much. Despite being unnecessary it was still well done, yet it was too much. The movie came off as too ambitious, soaring too close to the sun, seeming to try doing everything because the entire vibe and pace of what appeared to be an absolutely gorgeous experience.
It actually was brought into the Cloverfield franchise without reason, Josh Campbell and Matt Stuecken scripted it as an ""ultra low budget"" movie with an orignial title, The Cellar. However the franchise did indeed grant a 15million USD budget which allowed it to be the masterpiece it is today.
However the last ten minutes were not enough to daunt 10 Cloverfield Lane, as it went ahead winning fifteen various awards, including various for best screenplay, and being nominated for forty six other awards."
" Captivating and unpredictable.
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,8,"I love it when a movie keeps making me guess what is about to happen. I love it even more when I'm wrong. And I was wrong a lot watching this.I could almost call this a masterpiece, if it weren't for 2 important details:
1. The ending was rushed, I wanted more of that.
2. Howard should not have mentioned anything about aliens. That way, the ending would have had a much bigger impact."
" An attention gripping plot that had me guessing the whole way throughout.
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,8,"10 Cloverfield Lane was an amazing thriller continuing the film before. I did not expect the reviews when they came in. I knew it had to be good reviews, but they were better than good. I had no problems with it really except it didn't....I'm not going to spoil it. John, Mary, and John G. did very well."
" Almost brilliant, but ....
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,5,"It starts off very well, and for the most part it's very well played and directed. A tense, psychological thriller about a woman who wakes up after a car crash to find herself in the doomsday bunker of a man who tells her there has been ""an attack"" and the outside world is not safe. Has he saved her from death, or is there a more sinister explanation? Unfortunately, towards the end, after she escapes, the film completely changes genre and the last 15ish minutes become a ludicrous sci-fi alien invasion. Had it ended after she got out, I'd be thinking at least an 8, maybe a 9, out of 10. Sadly the ending completely ruins it."
" You won't get the plot until the movie ends.
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,8,"Story-line => 4/5 (Ending was too trivial for a movie like this);
Acting => 5/5 (Top-notch);
Directing => 5/5 (Hats Off);
Visual Effects/Animation => 4/5 (Good but didn't like it in the end);
Screenplay => 3/5 (Not enough bold);
Personal Recommendation => 4/5 (I enjoyed it but wasn't satisfied because of the ending.)"
" John Goodman is too creepy
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,7,"I liked this movie - but man, Goodman almost did too good a job - he was SO CREEPY!"
" That Spectacular Ending!
",2020-06-03 00:00:00,10,"It's quite rare that i give a movie 10/10 but with this i didn't hesitate.
From start to finish 10 Cloverfield Lane keeps you firmly gripped. Don't read any spoilers for this fantastic movie, just head straight into it and be amazed!
Quite a few times i thought there was going to be some predictable outcomes but they were never realised.
Then that super twist ending completely blew me away!"
" Don't Watch it.
",2020-05-31 00:00:00,4,The ending sucked ruined the whole thing. The whole movie became unbelievable. While she was abducted it was alright but I was hoping for a better more believable ending that tied together what she endured.
" It really has nothing to do with the first Cloverfield
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,7,"I read reviews saying this had nothing to do with the first Cloverfield movie but I still wanted to watch the first one first, in case there was some link to it. Nope, this can be viewed as a standalone movie entirely so I have no idea why they had to use 'Cloverfield' in the name.. And it is a superior movie; I would make it an 8/10 if it weren't for the ending, which if not bad per se is definitely not on par with the rest of the movie. More psychological thriller than sci-fi with fantastic acting; I guess when you have only 3 actors in your movie, even with a small budget you can afford good ones."
" The aliens were unneeded
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,7,"It was a great film was really enjoyable but it could've just ended with her taking the mask off then going to live her life, no one would've complained. Just found the alien bit just unnecessary but all in all the film was actually good and I'd fully recommend."
" The ending man.... so close
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,7,"I massively enjoyed this. Just not the ending. And here's why.
So the majority of the film is this thriller/mystery and since Michelle is also in the same boat as the audience it's great to watch it all unfold. If the ending was 15 minutes before, it would have been a solid 8/10. Listen, I get this is part of the whole ""Cloverfield"" thing they have going on. But the entire ending sequence is just not needed and just doesn't fit with the tone of the entire rest of the film. Feel as though they just lobbed the ending in just for the sake of it. If this was just simply a thriller movie it would have worked so so well!Acting is really good though, the plot was great (not the end) and the suspense kept throughout was done really well. So yeah, if you enjoy thriller films then definitely give this a watch it really does it well. Just expect a weird end."
" Who is lying?
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,9,A great claustrophobic mystery. Who is lying? What's going on? Is it a clue or a red herring? Someone it going to die but who? Great story and acting.
" An improvement over it's predecessor.
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,9,"Cloverfield is one of my favorite movies, so the fact that this is better just shows how great it is."
" Stuck Inside A Bunker With The Cloverfield Blues Again
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,7,"First off, if you are not a fan of John Goodman, this movie is not for you. He puts on a bravura performance as an unhinged survivalist that may or may not be telling the truth about the conditions outside the bunker (after some undefined apocalypse) to the two survivors he's basically trapped. Two-thirds of this movie is a character study with very little action but well done if you like that sort of thing, which I do. The ending of the movie has disappointed people, but I thought it was great. Plus, Mary Elizabeth Winstead does her usual fine acting work, so this is a must for her fans."
" Almost perfect
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,8,"Much better than the first movie. The first movie is still fun, but this one just can't compare. John Goodman's performance is easily the best part of this movie and totally got missed during the Oscar season.
I can't recommend this more. Very scary and well acted film. I recommend this to anyone."
" Very close to 10 stars
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,9,"Maybe I should give this 10 stars because this movie is very very good.
My only reason for giving it a solid 9 stars is the ending. Without any spoilers its like they left room for a part 2... I dont like that"
" 10 Cloverfield Lane
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,7,"10 Cloverfield is a thriller about a woman who wakes up in an underground bunker, after a car crash, and is told by a man that the world is under attack, and she must stay with him. This film is a good thriller, simple as that. Not amazing, outstanding, or brillant, but very good. This film is filled with slights twists and turns in narrative and whom you are supposed to believe, but at the end the audience is hit with a huge twist. Some people may find this twist to ruin the movie, but I think the film's quality was heightened by it. Without the twist, the film would have been left at a more cookie cutter and generic level. Sure its bizzare, but it makes you question what just happend. With only three reoccurring characters in the film, two of them give standout performances. Mary Elizabeth Winstead was solid, and John Goodman was brillant as the prepared, ordered, yet psychotic man. The film sets a tone of isolation, but with a supsenful dark wonder of what the truth really is, and what's out in the world. The ending was rushed, but it still held up to the point where the film wasnt ruined"
" Suspenseful, intense and well made film... with a terrible ending.
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,6,"This film was almost great. Excluding the last 20 minutes, the film is very compelling. It features great performances by all actors and delivers an all around suspenseful and effective experience. I was really invested in the movie until the ending. Unfortunately, the ending takes an unexpected turn into cliche and lazy writing. My advice would be to watch the movie, and just turn it off at the 1:28:20 mark. It's much better that way, trust me."
" 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)
",2020-04-28 00:00:00,8,"An amazing suspense thriller this for me is a masterpiece. Established with strong acting performances and thrilling set building, the film maker will succesfully recreates the horror genre in a fanatic and a fierce manner.Overall - 4/5"
" ""People are strange creatures. You can't always convince them that safety is in their best interest.""
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,7,"I was conflicted as to whether to categorize this film as a psychological horror-thriller or a monster flick (probably more to the former). The film was very much hyped back then (partly due to the viral marketing strategy employed); a long-awaited sequel to its critically-lauded predecessor, Cloverfield (2008). Instead, we got a remarkable quasi-sequel.WHAT I LIKE: The atmosphere of the film was so intense and suspenseful; it doesn't really have any dull moments. There were twists at every turn; when you think you know it all, you actually don't. It kept you guessing right till the very end; is there really a catastrophic gas attack on the American soil? Or are they just kidnapped by a deranged old man? Or maybe there is more to it than meets the eye.WHAT I DISLIKE: I was geared up for an all-out monster flick, but I was bombarded with a gripping survivalist tale. I was sorely disappointed at first (even though it was a good film) because I felt cheated."
" My favorite.
",2020-04-22 00:00:00,10,"For the critics: This film not an independent creation, but the continuation of Cloverfield. It is perfect."
" Full of suspense spoiled by the ending
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,6,The movie kept me on the edge of my seat for more than an hour. But the ending was disappointing.
" Fascinating thriller. It hooks you from beginning to end
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,8,"Wow. What a great movie. The elements that I consider make this film great are : 1) the constant doubt that both the protagonist and us, the audience, have, on whether John Goodman's character is telling the truth or no and 2) The constant conflict in the film. There is not a single moment where the movie turns boring, or when it feels nothing is happening. The movie seizes every single second of its length to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The way the mystery gradually unwraps, and how the real John Goodman's character comes to light work great on keeping this tense environment at all times. No doubt, a great movie, and one I will recommend to thriller and overall movie fans."
" Uh... What Was That Address Again!?
",2020-04-18 00:00:00,6,"Even though ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" did have a ""PG-13"" rating going against it - This SyFy/Thriller (from an adult's perspective) actually did hold up quite well (for the most part).Yes. Indeed. - ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" certainly did have its fair share of trying moments where there were definitely some really noticeable lapses in the mounting tension - But, overall, this film's story-line clearly had some fairly intelligent thought put into it which I'd say easily raised it head and shoulders above all of the other ""PG-13"" junk that's out there."
" A decent mystery thriller.
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,7,"There are a lot of easter eggs here. And many many theories to discuss. This film did a good job. The thrilling it gave, and the mysterious plot point.You should at least give it a chance."
" (Un)Confined Craziness
",2020-04-17 00:00:00,7,"Re-watching the drama in a bunker that is ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is easier to relate to nowadays amid pandemic-related shelter-in-place orders. In a way, it's an amusing diversion to a fictional post-apocalyptic world. Part solid, claustrophobic drama concerning the dynamics of a triumvirate relationship underground--the rest of the picture remains effective, too, if you're willing to roll with the diverting contrivances. I don't especially care about the Cloverfield franchise, although the marketing of the movies has been innovative. This installment, in particular, was shoehorned ex post facto the subterranean-shelter script. Regardless, it rather fits in the sense that things are crazy in the movie from the get-go: from the abduction/rescue of a woman, that what at first seem to be a rape horror flick turns into a conspiracy-theory being validated by Armageddon and back into a sort of rape-threat plot, and that instead of the nut relishing his validation, he's mostly bothered by what little of humanity continues to surround him and exerts his energy on establishing his dominance over them. And that's just the stuff that happens before the bonkers finale.None of this would work, either, without some decent acting. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is especially enjoyable when in the fighting spirit. It's John Goodman, however, who steals the show. His character is a more horrifying monster than any CGI alien or spacecraft covered by dark and obscure angles and framed by an artificial shaky camera. It's the deeply-rooted human interaction that's terrifying and thrilling--not, frivolous fun though it may be, that franchise-building surface nonsense."
" Easily the best horror movie of the 2010s
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,10,This film was phenomenal. The acting was top notch. Filled with twist and turns with great direction. Definitely check this film out.
" Amazing sequel, but it's not really a sequel.
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,8,"This is one of the best thrillers of decade, thrilling and supense. Great characters and story. Well written. Ending was a bit too over the top."
" A brush with greatness
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,7,Could have been an amazing psycho drama. Ruined by the script (ending). Perhaps lack of trust for the younger actors. However first half proves they would pull that off. Amazing performance all around. Why would you go that way at the end?
" Still thinking how great it is!
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,10,"Amazing score,acting,screenplay every second of it felt engaging and chillingly thrill about whats going to happen it was most entertaining experience.ending was shocking as well as satisfying to watch comparing to 1st movie it was totally different and great than that!literally right from start to end i was in edge of the seat especially i wasn't expecting to be this amazing!Overall A Masterpiece."
" Holy cow, John Goodman is scary
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"In case you're wondering: No. You do not need to see the original ""Cloverfield"" to understnad this movie. In fact, they're completely different. You can watch one or the other on its own and still enjoy them. It's going to be really hard to write this review without giving too much away (and trust me, you want to go in knowing nothing about this film.) but I'm going to try. This isn't really a ""horror"" movie, per se. It's more of a post-apocalyptic thriller. The story is intriguing, but I was expecting a little bit more out of this. It's still a very intense movie, though. John Goodman did a terrific job. I'm glad to see him finally branching out of his typical ""nice guy"" schtick. He's anything but nice here. In fact, he's absolutely terrifying. Watching the movie, I felt very intimidated by him. While I do say that the first ""Cloverfield"" was better, this is still pretty good. Just watch them as 2 different movies where the only thing they have in common is the word ""Cloverfield"" in the title. It works as its own standalone movie, which very few directors can do. Well done, JJ Abrams! You've done it again!Grade: A- 9/10 4/5 stars"
" 10 Cloverfield Lane
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,8,"10 Cloverfield Lane is the spiritual successor to Cloverfield. Although not a direct sequel to Cloverfield it does share an overall tone and general creepiness that the first film had in spades. The sense of tension and dread that was present throughout the film was remarkable, and it impressed me that they could maintain that throughout the film. The well-crafted story that was expertly written by Damien Chazelle, Josh Campbell, Daniel Casey, and Matthew Stuecken. The directing was also on point, and both Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman stole the show with their performances. I did not see that ending coming. It was a delightful movie to watch, and I wished we got a direct sequel to this film just like I wanted for Cloverfield. Oh well. A great film to check out during our self-isolation."
" Good but absolutely POINTLESS
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,6,"The is Cool to watch John Goodman did great but throughout the whole movie they try to make you think he is crazy but if you watched Cloverfield 1 then you would know that he isnt so that makes this entire film pointless, The Plot Twist is ¨Suprise¨ John Goodman was not crazy and our protagonist has to fight an Alien at the end and she drives towards survivors and thats it. POINTLESS"
" Amazing!
",2020-03-23 00:00:00,10,"If you like movies where you can't predict the end or tell what is true and what is false, then this is the movie for you. Full of surprises."
" Terror Comes From All Sides
",2020-03-20 00:00:00,8,A great horror mystery thriller from a great debut in Dan Trachtenberg and great performance from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. but the most surprising and terrifying thing in this flick is the one and only John Goodman because he was amazing.
" Very interesting
",2020-03-05 00:00:00,9,"Anytime I was watching this film, I questioned wether or not to believe John Goodman's character, or if that noise was this or that. A very mysterious film with crazy plot twists and a great performance from the three leads."
" Fantastic
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,9,"Not as good as first, but very well done. Now lets make a 3rs to finish off the series."
" 10 for 10 CFL
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,10,Amazingly Well acted and tense thriller from start to finish with twists!! This is incredibly underrated
" Seriously Underrated
",2020-01-30 00:00:00,9,"Perfect blend of psychological thriller and sci-fi. It's so hard to tell what is reality and what is just crazy talk. You can't tell if you are watching a hostage situation, an apocalyptic epidemic... or both. John Goodman's character is a great mix of creepy, mentality unstable, caring, and scientifically smart. The acting is fantastic from Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She is an underrated actress. She is a smart-strong woman who is having a hard time believing the reality of the world outside the crazy-filled bunker. I love how
it ties the first Cloverfield into it by making this movie just a situation that is happening while the first one is happening. It's like they created this Cloverfield universe that blends nicely without being too in your face with a series. Side note ""Cloverfield Paradox"" is almost unwatchable and I am happy to warn you the clever Cloverfield universe ends with this one (as of now). If they make something similar to the thrill of this one, it would definitely be worth a watch. If you like psychological thrillers that focus on a small group of people, then you'll like the sci-fi twists thrown at your mind through this one."
" Bunker Buster
",2020-01-24 00:00:00,4,"Like a fast-food meal for the mind, this film is slickly assembled, mildly tasty and composed of utterly manufactured elements that contain only the barest quantity of real nourishment.Treading over very similar ground to numerous other confinement stories, and positioned as a largely in-name-only sequel to the JJ Abrams' found-footage monster flic, the nudgingly titled 10 Cloverfield Lane has a solid cast, sharply written (if episodic and predictable) script and a clean, stylish look, but - much like the subsequent The Cloverfield Paradox (2018) - in the final analysis it simply can't escape the impression that it is an wholly unrelated story that has been hastily modified and had a title slapped on it to shoehorn its narrative into an contrived franchise relationship with the earlier film.For most of its length, its an effectively staged post-apocalyptic survival picture; as the possibly PTSD suffering, conspiracy-believing, doomsday-planning survival nut, who rescues/kidnaps and browbeats a young woman and a farm hand who helped him build his bomb shelter, John Goodman gives a fine portrayal of quietly spoken, barely repressed insanity, a bit like a shell-shocked Alex Jones (although with a far greater sense of wounded dignity). The other characters are stock and under-developed but ably served by competent work from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr.Though very well produced and tightly directed, the film never really gets going; hampered by a limited budget and PG-13 rating, we never get much of a sense of the destruction we're told has been wrought in the world above, aside from one effective sequence where a lone survivor attempts to enter the shelter from above. Having established the claustrophobic setting and ambiguous anti-hero, the film quickly quickly runs out of ideas, and ultimately resorts to an ill-advised action finale - clearly tacked on at the producer's request - which negates much of the previous built-up tension and tips the whole enterprise into clumsy self-parody.In the end it's neither the intelligent confinement thriller it could have been, nor an imaginative or logical continuation of the Ahbrams picture, but a curious hybrid assembly that adds up to considerably less than the sum of its parts."
" Start guessing
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,8,Great movie that keeps you wondering the entire time. The 3 actors in this were great.
" Ending was disappointing

" 10 cloverfield lane
",2020-01-16 00:00:00,7,"10 cloverfield lane was so good and fun to watch small thriller with some great performances and intersting and unpredictable story and give us some good twists in a film,during that times i was very happy for what i was seeing on screen and then ending happend and put entire film on the lower grade,which is sad considering how good first and second act were made but all of that were ruined by putting aliens in the end and it complety changed mood and feel of film,some people were dissapointed that film didnt connected itself with original cloverfield film but i was happy becase of that until that unfortunate ending,if you love capivitive thrillers you will like most of a film just try to ignore third act as best as you can"
" Much better than first one
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,8,I think I would love this more if it wasn't connected with Cloverfield. If this movie ended in that shelter and us wondering if there indeed was a chemical attack or not it would be so much better. I didn't like the ending but everything else was great. The time they spent in shelter is the most interesting one.
" Tremendously suspenseful...
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,8,"Tremendously suspenseful - 10 Cloverfield Lane is one of the best movies of 2016. Not a home-run, because of the final act, but everything else is just so good. Like John Goodman, who shows why he is one of the best actors alive."
" One of my favorite films ever!
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,10,A fun film with a couple of twists! Acting is great. John Goodman shines like the Saint Louis native he is. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is great. It is superb!
" A Very Good Film
",2019-12-22 00:00:00,8,"I recommend this film. It has a story that is logical, mysterious, frightening and has twists. I see people complaining about the ending but for me it worked and worked well. A real shocker. I didn't expect it to transpire that way and when it did it was an eye opener and it was all really well done."
" VERY SUSPENSEFUL.
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,8,"I really liked how the movie lets u in the dark, trying to guess what's real and what's not, what will happen next, amd still always manages to surprise u."
" Worst
",2019-11-30 00:00:00,1,Total time wast movies with no logic.I don't think anyone liked this one
" Great movie, all the way until the ridiculous ending
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,7,"Unfortunately I have to agree with many of the reviewers here: the movie is great and builds up great tension, all the way up until the ridiculous last 10-15 minutes, where the protagonist defeats a bunch of aliens all by herself that probably just destroyed most of humanity. John Goodman does, like always, an amazing job."
" the ending was a bad move
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,8,"Actually a really good movie - a solid 8-8.5. The movie though ruined it, so the rating I'm giving it for that is actually a 7. The only reason I'm leaving it at eight is for personal reference - I might come back to it and want to remember 90% o the film being better than a 7."
" Hmmmm..
",2019-11-10 00:00:00,5,I'm still trying to figure out if I liked the film or not. Far fetched? Yeah... Empowering? Sure... Go in a hole and hide? wait for a savior? Or go forward? No matter WHAT? Hmm...
" Better than 2008 for sure.
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,9,"The 2008 Cloverfield was a great movie. Mistery, action, a little humor here and there, etc. My only problem with that one was the dark ending with the words that echoe around after I'm done, ""I had a great day"". This movie ends off with a little more hope. Sure the sci-fi was a little abrupt, but it was hinted at the whole movie, but sci-fi movies seem to be Abrams best work.John Goodman played a damn good villain in this movie. He was mysterious, cold, yet sort of funny with his wierd personality. The chilling score that plays throughout the movie helps with the mystery as well. This was much better than the 2008 one in my opinion."
" spooky!
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,7,"A girl is driving; apparently she had just broke up with her boy friend and she gets a call from him, and just when she is looking at who's calling she crashed and the car turned uncontrollably until she found herself in a bunker underground with her right leg bandaged kinda. She wants to get out bu the capturer tells her that she can't because there'd been an attack and the fallout obliterated everything. Air is contaminated and she's lucky to have been saved by him. The girl found another guy with her also in on the story. The girl hit the man with a bottle and tried to escape but just when she has opened the locks a woman shows up on the glass window of the door, exhibiting a burned face that is attributed, the capturer claims, to the unbreathable air outside. She gives up after she saw for herself that the capturer was actually honest and he indeed helped her. After getting used to their situation with her acquaintance, and the capturer. A air filtration system stops and the man ask the girl to climb into the duct and pass the incline to the place where she'd have to turn the handle of the system off on off and then on again in order so that the system resumes working. The girl discovered at that little room she is at now that there is a stair to a room above. She climbs the stair and found a window to the outside. She was shocked when she discovered the word help etched into the window from the inside and also two earrings that she later come to the conclusion belong to the man's daughter. She explained her findings to the guy but he told her that no this is not the man's daughter,, it is some other girl that disseapeared in his school for two years or skipped town and never got back. Upon this revelation, The guys got what is happening and began concocting a scheme to escape, namely make a suit that will help them outside against the contaminated air. When the man found out , the young man took responsibility and said that it was his idea and told the man to leave the girl out of it . HE apologized but the man shot him on the spot. From then on, The girl is in shock. She saw how her friend has been put in acid after he was shot and she took it upon herself to escape this doom situation. She fought with the man and pushed the acid barrel where he was lying. He then tried to grab her leg when she was fleeing through the duct but the girl got away and now she is outside. She was oblivious to what was waiting for her. She sees a ship in the horizon coming toward her but then it changed hr direction . It turns out that there has been a alien attack and the aliens ship was spreading the contaminated gas all over and there was already aliens on the ground attacking people. When Michelle got into the car the car was lifted by one of the aliens ship/monster and the girl got the idea to burn a wine bottle and throw it into the main mouth hole of the monster and she succeded in blowing it up . Now she is in her car driving again and suddenly the radio signal is revived and asking people to take shelter and if there is any one with experience in combat or can help medically to head for Huston where the attack has not been reined in yet as in the other regions. Michelle chose to go to Huston and help people there. Maybe because of the influence her experience had on her. Entertaining, Shocking film"
" i think its should be more connection with end part
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,8,Start of this film is good and story going well .its kind of atractive.but in the end you give me a whole world thats have nothing connection with front .its make me confuse.sendenly become a earth protecting war story.just too sendenly
" Couldn't wait for it to end. Or something to actually happen.
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,4,Spent the whole movie waiting for something to happen to movie the plot along. It was less fun to watch these people in a bunker than it would be to actually be stuck in such a bunker. Got so excited when she finally did escape and there were monsters outside. But then it ended.
" Speaking of Games...
",2019-10-20 00:00:00,1,"Cheated again. Shame on you Mr Abrams, and shame on me for allowing myself to be hoodwinked again. I won't go into the intricacies of the narrative, the performances, etc.; all of that has been elaborated upon by many, many others. I will say this to sum up my feelings on the film with this analogy: The experience was like being invited to a friend's house for an exciting new board game. The friend shows you the game and it's components, explains the rules, and it sounds awesome. And it is, but only until the game draws to a close...it all comes down to the final turn...anyone can win, and it doesn't matter who wins because it has been such a fun experience. But then, your friend suddenly and unexpectedly wins and then he informs you that the whole game was a scam. The game was fixed from the start; no one else playing the game was ever going to win. Your ""friend"" is a manipulative cheater, and you've been had. That is how I felt at the conclusion of this film; not only had my time been lost, but I had been ripped off as well.
I really wish I had played a board game instead of watching this movie."

" 10 Cloverfield Lane
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,7,"This movie upsets me. It's so great for around 90% of it yet there are little things here and there, but it's an exceptional movie all the same. Winstead and Goodman are incredible. The tension is palpable. And then the last 10 minutes comes along and sends this thing careening into a whole other genre and it just doesn't work for me."
" Excellent addition
",2019-10-07 00:00:00,7,"For me Cloverfield is an amazing movie (it's in my top 100 movies) so this had a lot to live up to,This is the second time watching 10 Cloverfield Lane, the first time I watched it at the cinema enjoying every second of a 'Misery - 1990 movie' type story unfolded,by the end of the film I had mixed emotions, one being 'wow that was great' and two thinking 'what has that got to do with the first movie' as I was expecting a massive monster, but still left the cinema thinking it was a great movie but I had lots of questions,Watching this the second time and having some of the questions answered I sat back and enjoyed the great story and the awesome acting from Winstead, she absolutely nailed her character as did Goodman.Well worth a watch"
" Do more horror, Mr. Goodman.
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,7,"I think this movie deserves to be judged on its own merits rather than what one thinks a Cloverfield sequel ought to look like.John Goodman is formidable as doomer having his time to shine and who is king of his castle. One doesn't know what to believe as we carefully consider our options along with the heroin.Tense, well paced and not without a sense of humour that doesn't detract from this tension, I would say this is superior to the first movie. So many little things in it work: ""I want us to be one big happy family""....chills...A lot of people condemned the ""ending"" meaning the climax. I liked the climax but I won't ruin it.The real ending (final 30 seconds) annoyed me but I've been more ticked off."
" Such a good idea...only this...(5,5/10)

" This Was Really Unexpected; In A Good Way
",2019-09-13 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)This film fires up real quick with a woman having a car accident and waking up in a compound built by a man (Goodman) to survive any type of worldwide or chemical attack. The woman seeing no evidence of an attack and being trapped in the compound looks to escape as the man retains a power position over her. Will she witness any proof of an attack and feel safe inside or will she keep trying to escape from the compound? Much of the story is a little cat and mouse, what is to be believed and is he telling the truth. As that develops and unless you have read detailed reviews, you'll never guess the final act to this, which was really fun and it worked for me. Kudos to believable originality."

" Much Better Than Average Shocker Film - 10 Cloverfield Lane
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,6,"With a bravado performance by John Goodman, who should have been nominated that year (I mean DiCaprio for the Revenant? and Damon for The Martian?....please), 10 Cloverfield Lane takes you from the first five minutes and holds you until the last ten minutes (which, quite frankly, disappointed me). Suffice it to say the ending was overwrought and unlikely, but then again, the whole film is overwrought and unlikely, but extremely entertaining. I just would have preferred a different ending. The direction of the film is letter-perfect and Winstead gives a great performance as well. The story is well-written and is paced perfectly. A film that is much better than the former Cloverfield film."
" Great thriller, Stupid ending
",2019-08-13 00:00:00,8,Solid psychological thriller piece throughout most of the movie. I loved the kidnapper character and how he was played. But i wish it would have gone in the other direction for the ending.

""Lack of setting variation"".
""Not many characters"".
""Plot in middle lacked a little adventure"".IntroductionCloverfield is a highly atypical movie series. The first 2008 movie simply called ""Cloverfield"" is nothing like the 2016 sequel we review today. These movies surprise and entertain in a way unlike almost any other sci-fi/Horror movie. Today the 2nd Cloverfield movie ""10 Cloverfield lane"", takes centre stage.StorylineThe storyline is too simple. Yes it details backstories, includes characters well, and surprises with deceit and changing character viewpoints. For me though, it feels slow in the middle and the ending lets it down. The setting is clearly restrictive, which doesn't help it's limited mid-section action.GenreThe surprisingly reliable ""Wikipedia"" defines 10 Cloverfield lane as a ""Psychological horror ... with science fiction elements"". This 2016 release I'd define as simply a Thriller/Sci-fi. Thriller, since it tricks the mind, and Sci-fi because of it's dystopian setting.
Whilst it isn't what you'd expect from a standard horror movie, it has a slightly dark theme. Still not really a horror though ...CharactersThe characters are very well played, and they need to be. The one-dimensional setting throughout, means good acting is essential here. In this way, the film doesn't disappoint. With few characters, the diversity is very effective here and helps with the psychological elements.
The characters and behaviour, with heart-felt emotion, are difficult to fault, and keep surprising you.MusicThe music is used effectively to build tension, yet isn't overused. Types include ""Epic high suspense"" tracks, and ""Calming everyday tracks"". Silence is used on multiple occasion, with good effectiveness. Additional sound effects throughout, may have increased tension at times, but on the whole, music fits the plot well.SummaryKeeps you questioning character values.

",2019-07-01 00:00:00,8,After seeing the first and the third Cloverfield movie did not expect this one to be that good. Although the first 30-45 minutes might seem long sometimes the movie really accelerates from the half on and offers nice acting and some good tension and twists.
" my notes
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,7,"Great movie with great directing and acting. And a loud, powerful score. good intensity and suspense. great performance by goodman (about 2 viewings)
SPOILERS
the movie was pretty good up until she broke out, then I loved it. but that only lasted like ten minutes and left me wanting more of that part of the movie. it was a pretty unique twist. the whole movie you are wondering, is he a crazy kidnapper who's lying about the attack or is there really an attack and he's a good dude. twist is that both are true, didn't expect that. great line at that moment, ""oh come on"""
" Solid Thriller, Goodman is Outstanding
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,8,Keeps you pulled in and contrary to other reviews I enjoyed the ending. Worth the rent for a night!

",2019-05-26 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this movie. My friend was disappointed that it wasn't a monster movie like the first. I understand that. I tried to point out that despite this, it was an excellent thriller. I do agree that the ending should have been different. Try to watch with an open mind."
" Chilling!
",2019-05-24 00:00:00,7,I never imagined John Goodman could creep me out so much.
" Just skip the last 10 minutes.
",2019-05-15 00:00:00,7,"Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) gets in a car accident and wakes up in a strange room. This room is part of Howard's (John Goodman) bunker. He tells her that he found the car wreck and took her with him to his bunker. In there with them is Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) who fought his way into the bunker and now he lives there as well.And that's about it, 3 people living in bunker, really minimalistic but it works really well! We see things through the perspective of Michelle so we know as much as her. There are a lot of questions that need answering like ""Who are these people?"" and ""Are we really unable to go to the surface?"". A lot of tension is created through the behaviour of Howard, he might seem like a nice guy but you can't help to feel a bit uneasy when he's on screen. So Michelle and Emmett plan to escape.Until this point, the movie is very good but following their escape, it goes down the drain completely. So Michelle escapes and it turns out that nothing really happened to the earth so Howard just kidnapped them and made up a story so they wouldn't leave. This is where the movie should've ended in my opinion, a great ending! But oh no, it continues.It ends with Michelle fighting of aliens because they had to spend their 15 million budget on something right? So it ends with her destroying some alien spaceship and driving off into the distance.I really enjoyed this movie up until the ending so I would suggest just skipping it. It could've been a 9 but I'll just have to give 10 Cloverfield Lane a 7."
" Was far from what I expected, a must-watch for thriller and sci-fi movie buffs alike.
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,7,"Was quiet long, but intense. John Goodman did an exceptional job at playing his character (Howard), as expected and couldn't have done anything more to improve it. Mary Elizabeth Winstead also did a good job, which came as a surprise to me, because I had never seen her playing a lead character in any of the movies I've seen her in before.Climax & Ending: as a sci-fi fliek with a cryptic storyline and an almost perfect ending, I think the movie took waaay too long to get to the climax - as we actually got to see some action, short as it was, towards the end and the audience finally got some answers on what really happened above ground. And although it was short, I can honestly say that the ending was still unexpected and was probably made like that deliberately, so as to set the stage for a sequel.The movie is a perfect example of how quality acting, storytelling and execution from the cast & crew will always beat fancy gimmicks."
" Sequence worthy of the first movie is worth watching
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,7,"I love Cloverfield, it's my favorite monster movie and I love it. This sequence is very good, I loved her style, I loved how they tell other stories of what happened at that time, I want them to continue doing good sequences and for Drew Goddard to take care of cloverfield again (I do not consider the paradox a clovefield movie or anything that rubbish), I loved the acting all are very well in the film, highlight to John Goodman because this was his best performance so far, the photography as always very good, different from the first in this with many more colors and plans open and closed because it is not a ""fond footaged"" equal the first, and the direction passing the feeling of claustrophobia and always showing well the size and the imposing of the howard, and I liked the refencias to the first film in the beginning of this one. Funny thing about this movie is that it works best if you have not seen and do not know the first movie, even if you know how to put yourself in the shoes of those who do not know and the end is suppressing, production set in not to say that it was a cloverfield film for the actors during the shootings, which made them more unimportant in the movie and what could happen.Errors:The guy is not so flexible and is slow, and gave many opportunities to kill him, I know he is big and imposing and has a weapon, but he had a chance of doing something and will not do anything.She knows that howard hit her car and brought her to the bunker and arrested her in that room, and yet she accepted those excuses?I waited for the whole movie to say, ""I do not care if it's out there like this or not I just want to get out of here, I do not care if I'm going to die or not"" this situation that should have happened at the beginning of the movie and did not happen.The moment of the woman at the door does not make sense to me, Why does not the woman simply say that she is seeing an alien invasion and opening it up that they are coming after her? and it's only you to look at the background of what Michelle knew, and where she was that you know she should open the door and get out.Questions That Were Left Open :Michelle's leg recovers, but Emmett's arm does not?the aliens did not invade the bunker or all the farm places why? being that they have advanced technology, they do not have any kind of technology or a way to know that there are people in the bunker?Problems in the movie as cloverfield franchise:The end of the movie is very bad for me as clovefield franchise, in this final part of the movie you can see that there is an advanced alien race attacking the earth, and that the clovefield as a weapon, which is a concept that destroys The first movie for me, the cover of the first movie says ""something found us"" and this is super good to think of and you go and know that it is just some technologically advanced aliens that ""found"" us and attack? I thought the clovefield is an intelligent alien by itself and that somehow came here and started to colonize and destroy everything,and not that he was controlled or commanded or something, and I think it should have more aliens because I think it's cool and I think it's great to have it in the end, but that they were monsters and inferior to the clovefield, same ones of the first film are that bigger, but because they use advanced technology demonstrates that others ah above it, the clovefield is a mysterious creature that appeared on the earth, so he wanted it to continue this style leaving him emperor as an alien monster.The part of the radio inside the car at the end of the movie is SERIOUS? WE ARE WINNING ? HOW? one of the BEST things for me in the clovefield movie is how the movie makes it clear that everything is over, there is no way to prevent such an attack and everyone will die, he shows this all the time in the movie, with the absurd reproduction he has with his cubs as they infect humans easily, and the end is perfect because they throw a nuclear bomb in the clovefield and it survives and continues, nothing can stop it is the destruction, something that came to take everything and in the 10 clovefield lane shows that the most aliens attacking the earth. Humans magically winning the technologically more advanced and intelligent aliens who planned the whole attack, I found it funny how the term ""found footaged"" did not fit clovefield's first movie, because there was no one to have found that recording because everybody died and we were just watching what they recorded, because I think it's bad that you know that the whole ""found footaged"" someone think the recording after or most of them, but they and Clovefield have to be like that too, the ""10 clovefield lane"" and MAINLY the trash of Paradox destroyed the first movie.Conclusion:Note 7/10, In his first movie Dan Trachtenberg ja debut very well, after doing this with the fantastic short of Portal that is a game that I love, he comes and directs a follow-up to a movie that I love, and does it very well together with good acting performances, everything in this movie is fantastic and it creates a climax of tension and mystery all the time, a sequence worthy of his first movie, is worth watching."

" John Goodman excellence in Saw esque turned Independence day
",2019-03-01 00:00:00,6,"The first thing we see is the main character Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) supposedly running of from her boyfriend, when suddenly she ends up in a car crash. The crash itself seemed unnatural, and for some reason they decided to have the title flash in the middle of it, twice. It didn't start off on the right foot. But after that it seemed to find leverage.One thing we see is a resemblance to the first Saw movie, only one room and the main character chained up. It has promise. At first, the scenes seem much too extended and that didn't contain any excitement. But this changed the further we went into it. The lines and delivery are just about enough to keep the scenes interesting, but the main thing that brings turmoil is the content of what they're saying. The story in this movie is a unique one indeed.When a movie is made, solely focused on one room, you need dramatic things to happen, in a good way. This movie does just that. The story keeps unraveling as we go on, and turns out to be more and more breathtaking the deeper we go. The balance between action and calmness is also great, where there isn't more gore and activity than necessary. It is also the little things that builds up the different happenings, making for an aggressive expansion that thrills the viewer with excitement.The conclusion is set to be a big and horrifying twist to the tale, that would have been a perfect ending to a otherwise brilliant movie. Instead they ruined it. The ending seemed rushed and unscripted, like they ran out of time and just threw something in. It was just plain weird and turned this great film into a cheap action movie.Characterwise, they were not that interesting. Except for Goodman's Howard. Mystery surrounds him, is he telling the truth, or is he serial killer performing his frequent ritual? Well, for all the engaging depth of the character, it ended up ruined, all by the ending. It took away all the things during the movie that built up his intriguing character. However, Goodman's performance is not to be overshadowed here. He is surprisingly great as psycopath serial killer/crazy conspiracy theorist, deliviring a fenomenal performance. His acting is superior to the rest of the small cast, and he is truly over qualified for this movie, though he brings a very important piece to it.
In my opinion, Goodman is one of the most underrated actors of our generation, and deserves more praise.When it comes together, as The Beatles sang, this movie is filled with thrilling events in a horrifying story, but is totally ruined by the ending. It was a bigger anti-climax than biting into a juicy red apple only to find out it was made of plastic. Shame."
" Mysterious and intense film.
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,9,"This movie was very cool to watch because I got to see characters I grew to like get along and not get along. That gives the relationships a grounded reality they're in, and it's very entertaining when someone betrays someone else's trust, trying to go back outside. The story is very mysterious, however if you watched Cloverfield (2008) you might understand what it's about. The mysteries unveiled are pretty good mysteries when revealed, along with other details. The highlight in this film for most of it is truly the main character and John Goodman. They do a great job playing their parts. All in all, it's simply a good horror thriller. It keeps you guessing sometimes and it gets you intense sometimes, it's hands down the best ""Cloverfield Movie"". 9/10."
" Why did they wreck it?
",2019-02-25 00:00:00,7,"About 90% of the way through this movie I was thinking ""this is probably one of the Top 5 I've ever seen"". Then it ended. Probably the worst ending I've ever witnessed in a movie. All they had to do was cut to black after she went outside and took a deep breath. It could have been the perfect ending to one of the most intense movies. You never really knew if a twist was coming or not. Then, BOOM. From 10/10 to 7/10 because of the ending."
" Superior to the first.
",2019-02-24 00:00:00,8,"Going for a genuine film instead of a found-footage film, 10 Cloverfield Lane's strong direction, standout performance from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and claustrophobic nature helps make this film superior to the first. The ties to the previous film are thin at best, but it's so good as a standalone film that, when it did reference the first, it didn't take me out of the film. Truly great film."
" Worst movie ever
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,1,"Worst movie ever, do not watch ever in your life. Waste of time, you will only regret watching this crap!!!"
" A Great Film, Turned Just Good by a Crappy Ending
",2019-02-21 00:00:00,7,"There's enough there to earn ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" 7 stars; for me, that means I liked it. There's no plot. None. And that's fine. It's a character driven story where the viewer gets to decide what to make of each of the characters. Whatever you decide will dictate how you view this movie. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is fantastic; relatable, convincing as Michelle. John Goodman's Howard is as mysterious and eerie as they come, yet to a degree sympathetic at times, adding to the dynamics of the characters and the film as a whole. Emmett perfectly rounds out the trio as viewers tow - the - line trying to figure out whose side he's on. Of course, with ""Cloverfield"" in the title, aliens are to be expected. The low - budget, limited effects from the beginning are tossed out in the last roughly 20 minutes or so when we're finally introduced to the terror we (or at least I) was sure Howard was making up - cheesy aliens with even cornier effects. The aliens reminded me of the things from Stephen King's ""The Mist"" movie adaptation and add nothing to the story. Naturally, Michelle is able to fight them off and, we assume, becomes a true badass by heading off to Houston to help in what will be a probable sequel. Am I likely to watch should it come to fruition? Sure, but not with the overwhelming enthusiasm I would have for another suspenseful, character driven, realistic fright."
" Final was terrible
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,5,"I liked the movie but I did not expect it. I was expecting this man to be a psychodist who just built this bunker to have someone to live with. There was a piece of fantasy in this movie that I never expected. I did not expect such a final and I am slightly disappointed. It was supposed to be a movie about how a girl was slipping out of a psychopath or something, and it turned out to be quite different. Still, the movie was a good thing I missed, so I give it 7 stars"
" The Right Postcode!
",2019-02-20 00:00:00,8,"I'm probably in the minority, but I disliked Cloverfield ... intensely! So many of these found footage films as far as I'm concerned, are just an invitation to watch someone's tarted-up home movie. Their producers/directors should be commended for being excellent marketing strategists in being able to convince punters to part with their hard-earned, to watch some (generally) cheap, tacky B feature. Cloverfield was no exception.However in a significant turnaround, I'm happy to report that the Cloverfield's ""blood relative"" (according to JJ Abrams) is a much better production and a far more interesting story, than its predecessor. Technically speaking 10 CL is streets ahead, with the found footage format dispensed with and a small, but very professional cast employed in telling the story of 3 people dealing (not always on a voluntary basis) with life adjustments in a world affected by the events at the end of Cloverfield.The cast were uniformly good with Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Michelle and John Goodman as Howard being the obvious lynchpins. Knowing virtually nothing about the storyline going into the film (apart from it having some vague relationship with Cloverfield), I have to admit I was pretty much hooked by the unfolding series of events affecting Michelle pretty early on. And as both her seemingly sometime antagonist and ally, Goodman's Howard is the perfect physical contrast. But very pleasing to see another independently resiliant and strong female lead character being featured in such a surprisingly entertaining and thrilling sequel as 10 CL turns out to be.Much has been commented about the film's climax. I have to admit to some ambivalence. This is where the relationship to the earlier film is given some clarification, whilst overtly setting up the stage for a later episode. Still rejoicing over the absence of found footage, I guess I could just about accept anything thrown up by the producers. I will admit to some disappointment in that the events are clearly played out in real time, with Michelle emerging from the shelter at what is clearly the beginnings of dusk. For some reason an unlikely darkness then overwhelms the setting within about a minute of screen time and with the subsequent taking up of hand-held cameras, the action suddenly becomes more difficult to discern. Though I was still somewhat relieved, I can understand how others may have experienced some disappointment.I'll admit to looking forward to the next instalment and even perhaps girding my loins and giving the original another watch, just to see again how well (if at all) it sets up this story."

" Bad ass
",2019-01-24 00:00:00,8,A little too cutesy with call backs and foreshadowing. But MEW rules. The twist toward the end isn't that surprising but the set up is good. John Goodman is great as a creepy kidnapping dad.
" Ending ruins the whole idea
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,7,Until the last ten minutes the idea was amazing and unique. If we didnt see this spaceship and the aliens it would be a much cooler movie than this. And people dont get an ordinary woman suddenly blows up a spaceship with a molotow. That was really absurd.
" This is the real example how you can ruin great movie
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,5,"Movie started good. Good idea with bunker with a lot of tension. John Goodman played a good role of a misterious man who maybe kidnapped girl. As movie was passing it was clear that some action must happen. But how they presented that action? She somehow escaped from the bunker and killed one big allian eye with one single montolov. And wuth that,she destroyed full ship? While she ran away from one little problem in the beginning of the movie. So,don't watch last 15 minutes of movie if you want to keep good critics for movie."

" It started out superb; then slowly progressed to an unrealistic viewing.
",2018-12-30 00:00:00,7,"In the beginning, it caught my attention. I would say from the moment the exposition occurred, it would be a 10/10 star film. Amazing! Then 3/4 in the way in, it slowly began to go downhill. It featured aliens, and other unrealisitic animals. If your looking for a horror, keep looking. If your looking for a scientific film, then you would enjoy this.
Depends.
It varied throughout the duration.

" A clever, suspenseful and unique thriller
",2018-12-27 00:00:00,8,"The best part about 10 Cloverfield Lane is that it keeps you guessing. John Goodman does a fantastic job of portraying a character you don't know if you should trust or not, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead is a conflicted and effective protagonist. This is a clever, suspenseful and unique thriller that is definitely worth a watch."
" Boring and terrible end
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,1,Just don't. It is a wast of time. Some explanations are missing and the end is Very disapointing.
" Thought it was pretty damn good
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,7,"Really seemed a little slow in the middle , but worth watching. The cast was really excellent including John Goodman. You just don't know, is he crazy or telling the truth..."
" Deviating from the first movie, but still rather enjoyable...
",2018-12-09 00:00:00,6,"When I found this movie, I must admit that I didn't even know that it existed. Yeah, well I can't really claim to be keeping up with news circulating about the ""Cloverfield"" universe.I enjoyed the first movie, so of course I wanted to see this movie as well. And I did enter the movie with no expectations to it. But let me tell you that I was more than genuinely impressed and entertained with what I witnessed here. While the movie deviated a lot from the predecessor, it was still quite an entertaining movie.The storyline in ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" was quite intense, from the very beginning up to the very end. So the writer and director really managed to enthrall me with this movie. And I love how the audience is kept in the dark about what is the truth and what is falsehoods.""10 Cloverfield Lane"" had a rather nice cast, despite it being a very limited cast with only a handful of people on the list. I was especially impressed with John Goodman's performance in the movie, and he really carried the movie almost singlehandedly.This is definitely a movie that is worth sitting down to watch and investing some time and money in. I was genuinely entertained with ""10 Cloverfield Lane"", which is more than I can say for the third movie in the franchise."
" Weak ending
",2018-12-08 00:00:00,7,Great movie but a really disapointing ending. So much potensial...
" Amazing until the end.
",2018-11-28 00:00:00,7,"Well I liked the setting and the tones of this movie and how it was progressing in the bunker and the creation of the characters so they had me on that one, but when it was close to the ending scenes adding aliens to the mix it was pretty ridiculous but also adds more possibilities for a franchise which I would be watching and looking forward too see. Setting: great! Plot: out of hands but did a alright job overall a amazing movie."
" Creepy conspiracy theorist is right for once in this entertaining ""Twilight Zone-like"" thriller
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,7,"10 Cloverfield Lane is aptly named a ""psychological horror film"" in Wikipedia. It's akin to a good Twilight Zone episode and features some top notch performances.
Nonetheless, the film starts off on shaky footing. We're introduced to the protagonist Michelle, played by a gritty and convincing Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She's just broken up with her boyfriend and gets into a terrible car accident, only to find herself waking up in an underground bunker, where she's chained to a bed by a creepy conspiracy theorist Howard, played equally convincingly by John Goodman.
It's not exactly very compelling that Howard has chained Michelle to a bed but the restraints aren't tight enough to prevent her from getting to her belongings on the other side of the room and ultimately fashioning a weapon from a crutch, which she uses to attack him.
What's more, at one point she sets a fire to draw Howard into the room to attack him without thinking that she might be overcome first by the smoke.
And why doesn't Howard tell her right away what's going on? Obviously the film scenarists want you to believe that Howard intends to keep Michelle as a sex slave or perhaps end up torturing her.
When we finally do find out why Howard keeps Michelle prisoner, the sci-fi twist is introduced. Howard claims that he's protecting her as there has been an invasion (possibly by aliens) up above on the surface and they'll need to stay in the bunker indefinitely.
The idea that Michelle is being kept as some kind of sex slave loses credence when we discover that there's a third person in the bunker: one Emmett, a young man who claims he's worked for Howard doing odd jobs in the past. Emmett also believes earth has been invaded as he witnessed an unexplained explosion prior to gaining safe refuge with Howard.
Michelle finally becomes convinced that Howard is on the level after climbing through a narrow vent (she's the only one who can do that due to her size) in order to repair a malfunctioning air pump. While in this secluded area of the bunker, she is startled by a desperate woman on the outside who appears to have lesions on her face and is pounding on the window to get in. Michelle ultimately doesn't allow the woman in and now believes Howard's claims that something dreadful indeed has occurred on the earth's surface.
The tension is further exacerbated after Michelle discovers that a young woman whom Howard refers to as his daughter is actually another woman who disappeared two years prior. While Howard's conspiracy theories about space aliens might be true, it's also become apparent that indeed Howard is a dangerous sexual predator.
Michelle's determination to escape the bunker reaches its apotheosis after Howard shoots Emmett to death after realizing that he's been plotting to stop Howard and escape with Michelle.
You can probably guess that Michelle does indeed escape, killing Howard in the process. Nonetheless, there is still a third act here which turns this film into sci-fi and not only as part of a horror genre.
Yes indeed there are actual bad looking aliens attacking humans on the earth's surface and Michelle narrowly escapes being done in by one who's piloting a space ship. It's all a little bit hokey but following the entertaining saga with Howard, one feels satisfied that the ultimate question as to how truthful Howard has been with all his conspiracy theories, has been answered.
If you're not too busy, 10 Cloverfield Lane is an entertaining diversion. Goodman as the creepy Howard is right on the mark and Winstead as the intrepid Michelle will make feminists proud! If you like Twilight Zone, this story is certainly a decent enough approximation."
" The movie that's full of doubts until the end..
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,6,"If you have read any comments before, you're already spoiled as this movie works best if you know the least (Just know that Cloverfield was destroyed by aliens from the past movie is enough!). Because if you know even a single piece of fact, the rest of movie will become predictable.*Spoiler* The end of story is really bad. I think better version should've been the protagonist was killed once she escaped and met the alien. This way the movie will end with idea of two choices: Either living with a lunatic(?) in a confined space or escape from it and die. Too bad the movie introduced a third option where the protagonist becomes a super girl and fight with aliens. Very stupid ending, though during first half period have me fun of guessing and pressure. Thus 6/10."
" It was good until they effed up...
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,7,"I was really digging it but then they really messed it up with that ending. It would've been perfect if they explained about the other girl that used to be locked up, and just not bring aliens into it!!! If they had left it with the reasoning of another country attacking it would have been a lot better, or even she coming out to realize it was all false and she had just been kidnapped... just anything but those aliens really."
" Could be better
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,7,Film was good i expected but could be better asspecialy last part of it
" Just Bad
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,1,Ok we don't know whats happening in the movie but that's because what happens is extremely stupid! I just wasted my time and I am really sad about it!
" Never watch this film
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,1,I never write review but people should not waste two hours of their life on this... terrible
" Psychological Sci-Fi Suspense Drama
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,9,"At first glance, I probably would not have taken the time to watch this movie; I am not the type that cares what actresses/actors are in a movie, and the title was somewhat deceptive...since anyone who has seen the movie Cloverfield and didn't really care for the nauseating video camera effects, might think that it is related to that movie.
I watched the trailer and it still didn't produce any wow factor, but I decided to watch it anyway. At first the movie starts a little on the slow side and but it quickly gets interesting. Character development is lacking, but what information is given; actually is the perfect amount for this type of movie.
I think one of the best ways to describe the movie, with giving too much information; is that if you liked the movie 'Misery', you will enjoy this movie...there are several similarities between the two movies. Main character held against their will, what appears at first to be a psychotic captor - who in reality is extremely intelligent, suspense from not knowing what will happen next; overall I definitely think that it worth watching."
" Movies should be about something.
",2018-11-03 00:00:00,4,"The first 95 minutes of this movie was pure exposition for the next sequel. The last 5 minutes, was a microcosm of the sequel.
These guys should take a script writing course on how to make a movie about something other than what they plan to make in the future. Or leave the movie business and take their money-making crystal ball with them."
" Confusion and tension
",2018-11-02 00:00:00,7,"Let's get straight to the point: there is a line and this movie crosses it way too many times. As I expected from the start of watching this movie, there were a lot of questions left unanswered. I could deal with some of the less important details, but the story does not go anywhere in the end. A few examples of these unanswered questions are:
What is Michelle's background?
What happens next?
To what extent did Howard tell the truth?
What role does Britanny play in the story?All in all, the movie causes a lot of confusion, but the reason I think it still deserves a decent grade is because the tension in the movie is tremendous. I loved how the viewer is kept in suspence throughout the entire movie. The character design is also terrifically done. This movie could definitely use a remake or a sequel, which is honestly not something I often say about movies."
" ""As of Friday, kindness and generosity are antiquated customs.""
",2018-10-30 00:00:00,7,"Geez, I hate when this happens. The picture starts out as a perfectly intense psychological thriller and then turns into....sci-fi? I think another reviewer had it right when he stated that the movie could have ended when Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) first made it out of the bunker and tested the air for breathability. Not sure if that would have worked too well if it was still contaminated, but one step at a time. Instead we get a look at an alien space contraption and another one of those 'Alien' inspired monsters, but this one with a bulbous pulsing head with fangs. I wish someone would come up with a creative new look for an outer space monster. Up until then, I thought the writing held up well with enough twists and turns to make you wonder what was going on with Howard and his paranoid fantasies. The description that Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) had of Howard being a 'black belt in conspiracy theory' was a pretty good one. I would like to have come up with that one myself. As it is, once Michelle made it back to the outside world I felt let down considering all that went before. I didn't think much of 2008's ""Cloverfield"", and when the movie was over, I thought even less of this one."
" 80% of the movie was so amazing
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,7,"Since the beginning my eyes were stuck on the movie and the mind made a lot of theories about what the story is and how it will end and also the plot kept changing a little which was amazing the way it was written Until...
The end sucked so badly, it totally spoiled the good part of the movie!"
" Complicated but ultimately worthwhile films
",2018-10-24 00:00:00,9,"This is a complicated film to evaluate:The first 90% of the film is an absolutely brilliant character-driven thriller set in the claustrophobic confines of an emergency bunker and was as sharply acted as a cerebral Broadway play. The tense, complex plot included the ever fluctuating question of Howard's sanity, in stellar performance by John Goodman; the chemistry between the 3 actors is top-notch as their characters' relationships shift and deteriorate; and then the suspenseful, violent semi-finale was ultra compelling. But then there's the controversial final ending:I agree with other reviews that the sudden alien attack is extremely disjointed, but altogether, I actually think it kind of works. First of all, it turned out that Howard _was_telling the truth, and the world as they knew it was no longer safe. And yet, given how things unfolded in the bunker, it raises the core philosophical theme of the movie: What is worse, the monsters that attack us, or the monsters in ourselves?Secondly, this also worked as a sequel--the first film was about the initial invasion of the Godzilla-like creature and similar monsters, while this movie was about the full blown invasion.Also, I actually think the Cloverfield films are refreshingly realistic depictions of what what would happen in such a disaster: Will Smith doesn't zoom in with a fighter jet to save the day, and The Rock won't march us to safety as he punches out everything in his path. As both Cloverfield films depict, people will freak out, turn on each other, make incredibly stupid decisions, but somehow a few survive to fight another day. And each movie shows a distinct perspective: the first Cloverfield movie could be taken as a broad depiction of how the disaster sweeps through millions in the cities, while this second film is an intimate portrait of how people in isolation deal with the same/similar disaster.Overall, I highly recommend this as a strong stand-alone film, as well as the clear standout of the Cloverfield series."
" A claustrophobic and suspenseful mystery-thriller.
",2018-10-19 00:00:00,8,"Arguably, the worst aspects of '10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)' are those that tie into its franchise roots, which is understandable considering that this started life as a completely original screenplay before it was contorted to fit into the 'Cloverfield (2008)' ""universe"". These issues are really only limited to a somewhat rushed finale, though, and the final result is still a much finer film than its predecessor. It's an incredibly intriguing and evolving mystery-thriller that's consistently entertaining and suspenseful, as it uses its small core cast of well-realised characters to drive the tension within its (mostly) single, increasingly claustrophobic location to expert effect. It's incredibly compelling mainly because of its intense focus on character, while it's the several subtle twists and turns that keep us on the edge of our seat as our reading of the situation (always seen through the lens of the protagonist) continues to organically change. Ultimately, the piece becomes perhaps one of the most enjoyable entries in its genre. 8/10"

It began as such a simple terrifying concept and becomes so complicated and diverse."
" An interesting concept that's ruined by the Cloverfield name
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,6,"The whole driving point of the film is the suspense of not knowing if John Goodman's character is an overly controlling doomsday nutcase or if he's right to stay inside because of an unspeakable threat outside the doors. The problem, however, is that we know he's right since this is titles as a part of the Cloverfield world - so all suspense is lost before it even really begins. There are some great ideas in here with some genuinely tense set pieces, but when the overall premise is so flawed it's hard to hold it up to such a standard as the original Cloverfield film."

",2018-08-17 00:00:00,9,"10 CLOVERFIELD LANE science fiction golden child jj abrams again super idea and a great movie.
I first saw this cool start-up movie cloverfield in 2008 and then I learned that it was a serial, and there were a total of 3 movies linked to each other with small details.After this movie I will watch the movie cloverfield paradox.Now let's go movie. Michelle, the heroine's lover we see fighting and collecting things and going to one place but we never find out where it goes We're constantly confused throughout the movie but we take almost all the answers we just do not know where Michelle went,
I think it would be nice to have information about it.
then we open our eyes in a shelter, I do not know how many hours have been left unconscious.Was it during the movie that it was invasive or not?Like Howard is bad or good.There's a constant dilemma throughout the film that can amaze you anytime A great movie full of surprises.There may already be some question marks on the entire cloverfield series that have never been squeezed into a wonderful mystery bunker that is a completely different mystery.It's a bit confusing in the final stages and it sounds a bit absurd to me, but the movie is really nice."
" Another example on how to mess up an ending
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,5,"It could have been a classic had it not been for that terrible ending. Everything was going well, the suspense between the characters, was the bunker man telling the truth? Everybody watching could not say, he looked like a man with serious psychological issues.
Now, what is this obsession with presenting aliens as some sort of prehistoric dinosaurs with a big nasty mouth eager to eat you? Does anyone think that a dinosaur like creature grinning their teeth would have the brain and the ability to build a space ship and travel through space? It's ridiculous!"
" story first
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,8,"10 Cloverfield gets right what movies in this genre fail to do, they ignore story while piling on tired predictable dialog and CGI to try and compensate, this is not that movie"
" Truly Tense
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,8,"Fantastic anomalous 'horror' relying solely on the environment and generic film techniques as opposed to straight up jump scares or 'quiet, quiet, Loud!' This film is fantastically well made. Set in an isolated bunker with three characters, food and board games we the audience are also trapped with no hint at what's happening/happened above ground. Heart pounding and genuinely thrilling the end somewhat let's the film down but in the whole it's fantastic, well worth a watch"
" Turned Sour
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,9,"The whole movie was an awesome experience... almost. What ended up slightly ruining it was the ending. Without watching any of the Cloverfield movies, it definitely takes you by surprise. The idea of the ""chemical attack"" being perpetrated by foreign military in of itself was already a super cool concept. Instead... it was aliens, and that left a bad taste in my mouth. It made it almost tacky. Besides the ending, the rest of the film is amazing and would totally watch again."
" This is a thing
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,4,"Didn't know this was apart of cloverfield, I did find it strange that it was in the title. There isn't much action and it's just them living underground day by day and John yelling about idk. Not a fan but 4 stars for Johns profromance."
" Ending Ruined It :(
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,2,"This film started out extremely strong, with it's thriller/horror elements pulsing throughout the films many tense moments. The film was even in its downtime conversations, and sometimes terrifying sequences. The film uses the plot of Howard thinking there are aliens beyond the bunker as a good device for how he lies to both the main characters in order to secure them in the bunker. But the film is unfortunately being literal on this, and there really are aliens outside in big ships, flying around the place. What the hell? Then the movie literally becomes Cloverfield and the girl blows up one of the ships. I'm sorely disappointed that this film had to be a part of the Cloverfield Series, even though J.J. Abrams states it isn't. Overall the ending was something I couldn't and still can't get over."
" Good first half than falls off a cliff
",2018-07-20 00:00:00,6,"The first half contained mystery. Is Howard a monster who kidnapping Michelle for his own twisted reasons or is he an awkward good guy who is saving her and emmit's life out of human compassion.. It's an engaging question because weirdness does not equate to badness and maybe Howard will end up being a nuanced character, who despite his many pathologies is a good person inside and need some time and trust to show it. The surprise is there a door number 3. He's a nut and he's saving her. i liked the movie up until that point. Then the movie seems to lose interest in itself. The dialogue becomes loose, cheesy and the characters become horror tropes. the end barely makes sense and you get the feeling it's been rewritten 30 times and they desperately want to wrap it all up in something that is semi plausible. I'll watch just about anything with Mary Elizabeth Winstead. She can sit at a chair and table eating baked beans and I'm in. She was perfect. John Goodman was effective especially in the first half.. The second I saw Emmit i knew he was DOA. They were trying too hard to make him endearing and lovable and he was the barrier between Howard's and Michelle's alone time that the movie definitely was going to make happen. It's disappointing that a movie with so much promise would fail this hard as it went on. If you're bored and want a thriller slightly better than a B movie there are worse things to watch."
" It's not a Cloverfield sequel
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,9,"I'm happy that I watched this movie before watching Cloverfield 2008, so I wasn't filled with a sequel expectations. I watched it as a standalone movie and I enjoyed it. Unfortunately most of bad reviews from people expecting a sequel, if there's no ""Cloverfield"" in its title, the reviews would be totally better."
" Suspenseful and Interesting
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,7,"I almost feel like with the first Cloverfield movie, they didn't plan very well afterwards. I read somewhere that those two movies aren't related but, come on. Any ways, the suspense was great. The movie was interesting. It's a unique way to follow up from the first one. Still a lot of plot holes connecting the two in my opinion. But as a stand alone movie, I thought it was decent. John Goodman did a good job."
" A glaring issue
",2018-07-16 00:00:00,8,Great movie until the last ten minutes. Once she escapes from the shelter just turn the movie off.
" Numfon
",2018-07-15 00:00:00,5,"I think maybe better story but existed all story. When women go on the ground, She look like other movie."
" Pointless, Ridiculous & Abandoned Story Lines
",2018-07-11 00:00:00,3,"This was a stupid movie that probably could have been good. I don't understand the whole story line of his alleged ""daughter."" What ever happened to her? That story was abandoned, so what was the point in introducing it in the first place? He was obviously a psycho too, but the only person with a fall-out shelter. Right. I never once really believed anything was happening outside. Then it turns out to be ridiculous in the end. One girl single-handedly takes out the big bad alien (with a molotov cocktail no less) but our military couldn't destroy it? Sure, that's believable. Ugh."
" 6 for a good film, 10 for John Goodman's exquisite acting!
",2018-07-04 00:00:00,8,"In my opinion, a truly great film that is also part of an anthology and cinematic universe is one that can also function independently, so viewers who have never watched previous titles of the anthology (or are indeed ignorant to its existence) can still enjoy a rewarding experience. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a shining example of such a film, as its connection to the ""Cloververse"" is only made apparent in the final 10-12 minutes.The story is good, though not great in my opinion. Michelle, a young women, goes through a car accident and wakes up to find herself fully medically treated for her injury, but handcuffed to her bed. Enter John Goodman (Howard), the absolute best part of the entire film, playing a role so completely removed from his regular typecast that it feels like rediscovering him for the profound actor that he is. Seen him in Roseanne or The Flintstones movie? Forget it. Or bettet yet - don't! It would only make you marvel all the more at his terrifying character and the absolute amazing acting on his part. Goodman's character turns out to be Michelle's captor, but insists that he had saved her life from ""an attack"" that has made earth's environment uninhabitable. Goodman perfectly and exquisitely acts the part of a neurotic, disturbing and troubled navy veteran ""with a black belt in conspiracy theories"". Accordingly, he has slaved for years constructing a doomsday bunker with all the comforts of home.Has Michelle been kidnapped or saved? Is Howard a kindhearted savior or a deranged delusional homicidal lunatic? What indeed happened outside the bunker? All of these questioned are gradually answered as the viewer is tormented along with Michelle by not being able to know for a fact what is true and what is assumed. The ultimate conclusion could be guessed in advance by followers of the Cloverfield franchise, but others might find the ending quite surprising.All in all, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a chilling and thrilling experience of confusion, misinformation and terror. The absolutely wonderful acting by Goodman (and sufficiently good by rest of cast), the discomforting atmosphere and the suspenseful process of connecting the dots has left me personally on edge, terrified at times and applauding Goodman's acting. Honestly, I believe that even if some of you would find the film to be mediocre at best - Goodman's portray of a neurotic disturbed pseudo-antagonist would be enough to make the experience rewarding."
" So awesome...
",2018-07-03 00:00:00,7,"Absolutely brilliant! It keeps you guessing until the end and is not at all what you expected. Totally unpredictable! Truly unique and fantastic! A brilliant cast ensures credibility. John Goodman is excellent as the caring yet mysterious man, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead is equally good as the victim/survivor. The visual effects towards the end are awesome. The ending leaves the door wide open for a sequel, and honestly, I can't wait!!"
" Breath-taking with Amazing Score
",2018-07-02 00:00:00,9,"I seriously enjoyed this movie. It combines mystery, thriller, and sci-fi all together in this blend of movie genres that is perfect. I didn't know what to expect going into the movie and how sci-fi it would be but honestly I was astonished at how much I enjoyed it.Mary Elizabeth Winstead's performance is spectacular and John Goodman's acting was bone-chillingly creepy. He portrayed Howard's bordering paranoia and maniacal mind in such a way that it truly makes him unpredictable. Another thing that I greatly enjoyed was the cinematography. The sepia tones sprinkled all throughout the film gave the trickling feeling of how Michelle began to become comfortable briefly just to have that shattered and the shots become dark and grey. Next, is the score, I believe it was done by Bear McCreary and what a great job he did! All throughout the film you could really gain the sense of emotion or tension from the score and that is exactly what you should what from the soundtrack. A particular piece I liked was the track that played when Michelle was walking up the stairs for the first time to see the pigs and the growing anxiousness and temptation that lies in that door. One thing that shocked me was the ending. It was un-pre-dictable! And that's what I love about a film. I did not know what was going to happen to Michelle and how she would escape the new antagonist that appears or if she would for that matter. I also loved the open ending and that after her ordeal she had become hardened and ready to fight for others. I would love a sequel!"
" This is for suspense movie lover
",2018-06-29 00:00:00,8,"This is not for someone who doesn't have patience to wait till end.I find the concept mind blowing,I was able to connect with the characters and was thrilled throughout the movie.
Must watch if you love mystery movies."
" That went out bad!
",2018-06-26 00:00:00,6,"The movie's story was really exciting but wasn't used well especially in the end. The music written was working on intimidating the audience more than adding to the scene. The characters weren't that good but the actors did a great job in performing them. The movie had some unpredictable shocks that was pretty good but left some plot holes like why Emmett told the truth to Howard even though they could invent any other reason like that they were trying to make a costume as Michelle wanted to be a costume designer. Also some questions Howard's daughter that we didn't know what happened to her or why she wrote ""help"" or did he really killed her or why we mentioned the movie mentioned it in the first place and giving wrong picture to Michelle as that Howard was trying to make them really afraid of him thinking that he lied though he could not mention it in the first place. The place where they were hiding was pretty good with most of it's scenes and a good effort was done in it. The ending scene was like a superhero that I feel was a big flop with a shy shot of a monster. Overall I don't feel you should watch but it's worth a shot that I don't much recommend . I give it 6.5 out of 10 sadly for me I was very excited about it."
" not bad
",2018-06-23 00:00:00,7,"I thought it would be a more alien holocaust. Rather than its kinda survival. some things are uncleared why. how & why that happened! not so good, not so bad. actress mary was great in her acting"
" Everything is Explained, or Not ! or May be YES, or Not !
",2018-06-22 00:00:00,8,"Is is an ordinary kidnap movie ? or Is it another aliens invasion movie ? Could it be about a psychopathic killer ? What if you have a movie that has all the three attributes ? Welcome to 10 Cloverfield Lane.The movie starts with the scene of ""Michelle"" leaving her fiance house in scenes relatively empty of people which should ring a bell, in addition to the scene of Glenvagulin that we will see later in the end. Then moving to the car accident scene and the first appearance of our kidnapper/saver that will lead to more complicated actions.The beauty of the movie is the fast transition between the end of a plot and the start of a new one, and this continues throughout the movie till the very end. And the good thing for open end movies haters that everything is explained but this didn't affect the thrill dose.The director did a great job in keeping you in such tension and suspense without extreme action, and with these few actors in that tiny bunker. Also ""John Goodman"" really nailed it and his acting was superior to the other actors.It's really good to see how could a shelter look like in case on a disaster, with that much of books , movie discs, sound discs and little food relatively.At the end, it's a great movie that deserves to be watched with great attention to every detail that will not make you bored at any moment."
" Not worth a re-watch.
",2018-06-15 00:00:00,2,"Let me start out by saying that I haven't seen the original movie, so this review is purely based on the movie at hand.I saw this on Netflix and thought that I'd give it a go, especially seeing as I'd missed the beginning on television. I'm one of those people who has to see the beginning! However, with this one, it wouldn't have mattered much.The casting was good, but could still have been better! However, it was good to see John Goodman in a dark role, as we're so used to seeing him in a light, comedic role (at least, I am)!The movie starts off as a mystery (warning: if you don't want spoilers, don't read any further):
A woman wakes up in a bunker and is told by Howard (Goodman), who is a stranger at the time, that the air is polluted and, because of that, nobody else survived, therefore there's no-one looking for her. She is introduced to Emmett and the audience wonders whether or not he's Howard's accomplice. Howard passes Michelle some clothes claiming that it was another girl's clothes, but admits that they're his daughters, who used to love to design, as does Michelle, but her mother turned her against him and took her to Chicago. Michelle finds a picture of the former 'housemate' who is ""no longer with us"" and questions whether it really is Howard's daughter, or another woman who went missing and was never heard from again. Is Howard just bonkers?It was boring at the beginning, but picked up during the middle. It just lost me by the end, though, as it went from a murder mystery to a... sci-fi. Michelle then goes to combat with no prior combative experience, just because she heard someone's pleas over the radio. What a ridiculous decision!The writers and director clearly didn't have a clear vision for the movie and couldn't iron out the plot holes, or even tie them up in a neat bow! Would I re-watch or even recommend this movie to anybody? No."
" Medicore. All the good non spoilers reviews are bots.
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,4,So What the hell? This was one of the worst movies i've seen in 2016.as a psycho horror film was good but In the end turned into a generic sci-film. Don't waste time in this movie
" Tense
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,8,"'10 Cloverfield Lane' is a tense and enjoyable addition to the Cloverfield franchise. While this film may be set in the same world as the original Cloverfield and contain a few references to the events of the first film, it is ultimately its own movie. Everything from the characters to directing style - even the genre - is different. This was frustrating to a certain extent, as I had the expectation for it to be a follow up to events of the first film, but once you get used to the fact that this is a completely different story to the original film, you are able to enjoy the film for what it is. Having only a small number of cast members (four to be exact), the pressure is put on the actors to pull off a good job, as all the attention is on them. Thankfully, all the three main actors did a superb job in their characters, with John Goodman being the clear standout. He portrays his complex character so well, and until the final moments of the film, you are still trying to figure out whether he is a hero or a villain which I found rather refreshing. The storyline was quite intriguing and in-depth with many surprising plot twists that kept me on the edge-of-my-seat, just like the original film. The ending did seem quite out-of-place when compared to the rest of the narrative, but when looking at the film franchise as a whole, it makes sense and certainly sets us up for another addition the Cloverfield franchise (which is coming out in 2018)!"
" Awesome
",2018-05-31 00:00:00,10,This movie was put together perfectly and had me on the edge of my seat for the whole thing!
" It needed another rewrite
",2018-05-22 00:00:00,6,"It had some suspense and excitement, but John Goodman's character isn't explained very well. He kidnaps this woman he accidentally crashed into and chains her at first in a shelter with another person who isn't written well either and goes back and forth from being a bad guy and good guy. The shelter is because of a contamination and alien invasion, but it also deals with a possible murder that isn't explained well."
" Stirred things very well
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,8,"This movie was a movie of themes. People expected a masterpiece of a horror story, but it was much more than that. This went on with how the woman, man with the injured arm, and dude who controls this place all felt. But especially focused on the lady, who still has decisions about what to do with all the things she went through in that bunker. Lighting was very good. Acting was tense the whole time, which is all that was needed. There was a hopelessness feeling for the girl at times things went bad. A constant mystery for the end, to know how the whole feud between them would end. And it ended with a surprising finish. This is one of the movies that proves even filming in a room can be great, only if there's different viewpoints between characters."
" Expect crap, experience the full reward.
",2018-05-04 00:00:00,7,"An amazingly intense psychological thriller at every turn. Just when you think you've got it figured out, nope. Twists and turns lead to an unexpected conclusion. It takes a lot to hold my attention. This movie did that for every minute."
" A Contained Thriller (That's Somehow Related To ""Cloverfield"")
",2018-04-12 00:00:00,8,"I'm going to be judging this film as a standalone movie, not as a ""Cloverfield"" movie.A movie with this contained environment and small cast of characters really has to have good performances for it to be able to work. And it does. John Goodman gives a delightfully off-kilter performance that constantly makes me second-guess whether or not his character means the others harm. Mary Elizabeth-Winstead also gives a good performance as a girl in Goodman's bunker. But like other movie heroines, she's not a complete idiot. Her character is one smart cookie, which is relief to see in a movie like this.I also want to mention how good of a directorial debut that this is. Dan Trachtenberg previously directed the short film ""Portal: No Escape"", which I highly recommend (you can find it on YouTube). This film is very claustrophobic and masterful for this feature film debut.My only gripe with this film is its placement in the ""Cloverfield"" series. I really don't see how exactly this is a ""Cloverfield"" movie. None of the theories that can be made really stick, and that kind of bums me out (however, it's not as infuriating as ""The Cloverfield Paradox"").Other than that, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a movie that you should DEFINITELY watch."
" Genius comment on the reality of living as a women in this world!
",2018-04-08 00:00:00,10,"So basically, we have got a women, escaping her husband, only to be hit and locked down by the patriarchal society and its claim of protecting her from the danger that lurks outside. Choosing not to believe those claims, she beat the patriarchal society and escapes, yet to her surprise. The patriarchal society was telling the truth. The Outside has been invaded by a whole lot of danger. Yet instead of choosing to hide in safety. She decided to fight back, win and go out of her way to help rid the world of that danger! Genius"
" Lost the plot at the end
",2018-03-20 00:00:00,7,Thought this film was going really well as a tense thriller however at the end it all got needlessly mad
" Cliche upon cliche
",2018-03-16 00:00:00,6,"I wont spoil it for anyone planning on watching this thing, as a plus, Goodman is excellent. The premise of the movie has been done a dozen times before and I spent most of it wondering how they'd end it without being trite or screwing it ip. Lat 10 minutes gave me the answer; they screwed it up by making the ending totally preposterous."
" Tension, shocks and lots of tension, a very good watch.
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,9,"I've been a little critical of The Cloverfield franchise, particularly the recent offering, The Cloverfield Paradox. However, this film has some serious quality. 10 Cloverfield Lane has intrigue, mystery, surprise, shock, masses of tension and some unexpected sequences. As you watch you start doubting what you're being fed, you wonder if Howard is telling the truth (however crazy it sounds) or if he's a run of the mill psycho. The monster element is used to tremendous effect here, it really works on all levels, especially the shock factor, its presence is woven into the story well, unlike in the Paradox, where it's merely plonked in just because. Excellent performances all round, John Goodman is terrific.A very enjoyable, intriguing movie, with plenty of shocks and surprises, I rate this, 9/10"
" Good plot, poor execution
",2018-03-13 00:00:00,4,"Agree with all sonofocelot said. I would add that the woman coming to the door when Winstead's character tried to escape ruined the rest of the movie for me. When I saw her she confirmed to me that Goodman's character was not deluded into thinking there was a disaster outside. All tension of the plot was lost for me, not to mention the ending."
" Slow paced even watching in fast forward
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,1,Start off watching this and it got very boring very quickly. Watched the next chunk in fast forward which still gave me the gist of it. Watched the end at normal speed and still just as boring as the beginning. How this has an above average rating beats me!
" Build-up adequate, ending superficial
",2018-03-10 00:00:00,4,"This is only a variation of an old story where only some parameters are ""new"" and the end tries so hard to be unique and surprising that it falls into in the comic territory. Hardly what was intended.The acting is pretty good in the small cast, but John Goodman have been so much better multiple times. Here he puts on a sufficient persona that is almost convincing. Mary Elisabeth does the most convincing work and John Gallagher Jr. is quite adequate, but could have gotten a better presentation."
" 10 Coverfiel Lane
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,8,"10 Cloverfield Lane: A Place to Remember 
This past Saturday me and a group of friends got together to watch a movie we had always wanted to. We saw on Netflix that a sequel to 10 Cloverfield Lane had come out and thought that it must be pretty good if they came out with another one. This 2016 movie, directed by Dan Trachtenberg, was a suspense/horror film stationed just around the time of the apocalypse. The main protagonist, a woman named Michelle, is in a car accident and wakes up to find herself chained to a wall in a nuclear bunker. The events that led up to and including all the different circumstances are slowly revealed throughout the movie. To many individuals, this may sound just like another horror movie where the main character makes obviously foolish mistakes that lead to this ultimate demise, but it could not be more different. Michelle thinks of every possible way to escape the grasp of her ""captors"" but soon learns the truth about her situation. As the movie progresses we learn more and more about the characters and what they are all about. I found this movie entertaining, heart pumping, and thought provoking. I found it to be a satisfying mix between horror and suspense compared to some competitors. It was quite interesting to watch this woman and think, ""would I be able to think of something if I was in her position?"" The movie ended on a fairly large cliffhanger and I am looking forward to seeing the next in the series."
" Whoah!
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,8,"Just a short review, as I just have to say the ending was splendid! A great surprise and brilliantly done. Well done sirs!!"
" Old school but works
",2018-03-05 00:00:00,7,"From the guy who directed playtest in black mirror, if I knew that before I would never hesitated to watch it. Thanks to positive reviews I did. It starts as an annoying old school psychological horror flick, with a mysterious music to boot hitchhock style. At times too old school, like scenes where a character can't find the right key to open the door to escape and so on. Then things get darker and the horror turns into terror as imagination of the viewer starts to run wild. The ending really messes with your expectations but in the end it works as you weren't hyped in the first place. It's not one of those films that was hyped to be great so you can't help but dread the thought that it might not, or worse it turns out to be the opposite. It's one of those films where you go to see it to find out what is it about with no expectations. It's low budget but production value is very good, think Moon."
" Over rated and fake reviews. Waste of time.
",2018-02-28 00:00:00,2,A hollywood template movie that doesn't do justice to any genre. Looks like the director had no clear picture on how to take the movie forward with such a terrible plot in hand. Thriller/Horror/Sci-Fi is all you experience in the 100 minutes but it leaves you incomplete because of the abrupt genre switch and an absolute half baked story.
" Rating: A
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,9,"If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) suffers a car accident and wakes up in a bunker, discovering that she has been ""rescued"" by Howard (John Goodman). He keeps her from leaving by emphasizing that the world is no longer habitable following an attack on the planet.This is the second movie of the Cloverfield franchise and Dan Trachtenberg's big film debut, produced by the great J.J. Abrams.I feel like Cloverfield is a very underrated film. A lot of people didn't even saw it and they still decided to watch 10 Cloverfield Lane. Truthfully, you can do that and your movie experience will not change at all. Even though it is, in fact, part of the franchise, I can only find one and one only connection to the first one. I will discuss this one detail after my rating since it has a major spoiler for Cloverfield and a minor spoiler for the one I am going to review now.I love claustrophobic horror thrillers! I love when the film instantly makes me feel at the edge of my seat, ten minutes after it starts. Dan Trachtenberg's big movie debut does that for the entire runtime. The screenplay is especially intriguing and mysterious, which captivates me from the very start.The mystery surrounding the state of the planet and Howard's mental condition is so well manipulated, raising the tension and the suspense levels extremely present. There is always something new, there is not one misplaced scene (as we know, J.J. Abrams does not waste one single shot) and everything has its purpose whether that is a line of dialogue, an action or even just a shot of a bookshelf.On such a confined space, it is unbelievable what a first-time film director can accomplish. He is able to provide new feelings and fresh scenes after one hour in the same freaking living room. I admire the camera angles and the extensive use of visual storytelling (once again, I bet JJ has his hands on this). The editing is seamless and the tone is very well-balanced. A practical setting elevates the realistic cinematography and the subtle score helps to increase the amount of suspense.As for the cast, they are the real stars of the movie. Mary Elizabeth Winstead has her career-best performance. She is incredibly compelling and everything she does, she does it flawlessly. Her character is a remarkably unconventional one, having in mind the cliche dumb characters in films like this. They always do what they are not supposed to and the audience is always ahead of them.Not Michelle. She is extremely smart and she is way ahead of the viewers! There are so many twists and turns due to her craftiness and intelligence during tense circumstances. Her backstory contradicts her behavior once she is in that bunker, which proves how much the character had to change in order to overcome her situation.However, John Goodman might be the absolute standout. He is just perfect. He needs to do something a lot of actors struggle with: insert doubt into the audience's minds. Howard is someone that I never know whether if he is crazy or if he is actually a rational guy. In a scene, he seems completely insane but right in the next one, he does or says something notably clever.It is impossible to understand if he is telling the truth or if something is up. Undoubtedly, this is due to Goodman's terrific performance and also due to the brilliant script that he and everyone else received. John Gallagher Jr. (Emmett) is the third person living in the bunker and even though he is fairly well-developed, he is only there to serve the story (he is even connected to the moment that changes the course of it). Good display from Gallagher.The first act is fantastic and the second act is phenomenal. The beginning of the third act is enthusiastic, but its ending is really abrupt. This is going to be a big issue for most people. If someone is not paying attention to everything that happens in the first two-thirds of the movie (every line of dialogue, every sound, every shot of an object), the ending is going to even make people hate this film because they will feel that it does not make sense.To those people, I recommend you to stop and think about it. Think about the movie and remember everything that happened until the beginning of the third act. If you do this with no anger clouding your judgment, then you will surely understand what Trachtenberg and his team wanted to deliver. Nevertheless, it comes very quickly and I feel that the way they executed it, is asking too much of me to let pass some line-crossing stuff, even though it is a science fiction film.Overall, 10 Cloverfield Lane is a fantastic ""sequel"" (if I can call it that) to the movie that started it all. The entertainment levels are extremely high and I love the subtle connection to Cloverfield. Award-worthy performances from John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who carry a captivating and mysterious claustrophobic thriller. A wonderful debut of the director Dan Trachtenberg, who almost flawlessly tells a phenomenal story. The only stain in the picture is the abrupt ending and the way it is executed. The slow pacing helps to elevate the suspense and tension in a very unique film for its genre, while the technical aspects are to praise as well.
****************** SPOILER WARNING ******************
As I said at the end of my Cloverfield review, there is an extremely easy-to-miss black dot falling from the sky into the ocean, in the last shot of the movie.This is a satellite that for some reason fell from space. In 10 Cloverfield Lane, we learn through a couple of lines of dialogue and a shot of a bookshelf, that Howard's former job had to do with ... satellites. This is the only detail of this film that I can connect to the previous one."
" Interesting mystery film
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,8,"10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) is a film that's very intriguing. I love mysterious movies, ones that make you guess what's gonna happen all the way through. There were moments during the movie where It thought for sure that one thing was definitely true, then there would be times where I thought that something completely different was true. And I really love that, it's thrilling and holds your attention. The writing is smart overall and it does a great job of keeping your interest. The cast does a good job at handling their roles, especially John Goodman. Goodman plays his character with a mystery and certain menace that works very well. And I enjoyed the rest of the actors too. The plot is very interesting because it has multiple aspects to it. On one hand, you're thinking about Goodman and who he really is and if he is a good or bad guy, and then you're also thinking about whether or not the outside world is really dangerous and what is happening. I highly suggest this movie if you like this genre, it really is well made. 8/10 for 10 Cloverfield Lane."
" Fairly good attempt at something different
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,6,"10 CLOVERFIELD LANE is a bizarre and almost unrelated follow-up to the found footage monster horror hit CLOVERFIELD, which came out back in 2008. It's only at the climax that this film ties in to that one (although in actuality it feels more like SKYLINE) but for the most part it's a claustrophobic thriller set in an underground bunker. That it works at all is down to the presence of the ever-excellent John Goodman, playing it expertly as the survivalist captor hiding a few dark secrets. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is okay as the lead, but remains unsympathetic throughout, and the narrative is a little too slow at times, particularly in the 'happy' middle section. Still, the director ekes out suspense where possible, the guessing games are fun, and there are some nice and nasty twists in store."
" Delivers Everything I expected...
",2018-02-26 00:00:00,9,"JJ Abrams. I don't really like him. He wrote I wanna say... the last two Star Wars movies? Yeah. Were they good? Not necessarily... they had many faults.However, this movie delivered everything I expected from it. So, if you haven't seen it, let me give you a quick summary:A girl has woken up in the bomb shelter of a man that claims that the world has been attacked by something either chemical or nuclear, and the air is not breathable outside. Therefore, she must decide if he is a crazy psycho who is trying to kidnap her, or if he is telling the truth about the air outside, and it really isn't safe, and he is really trying to keep her safe. And I do have to say, this movie impressed me. For JJ Abrams, at least. The ending was kind of garbage, though. (I don't want to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it.) It wasn't... the best ending that they could have come up with. They should have given it more time, and they shouldn't have stuffed all of that stuff into the ending.Also, the science in this movie was really on point. Like, the acid. It was really cool. (Well, except for the ending.)Do not read any further if you don't want spoilers!!! I have decided to put some in here.(Warning, again: Stop about 20-30 minutes before the actual ending, when she is first getting out of the shelter to avoid the ending. Just assume that she got out, the air is actually breathable, and she is going to Houston to kill some aliens for the army.)So, 9/10 for being a good movie overall. Just avoid the ending... it needed more time to develop into something more."
" Solid, entertaining, bone-chilling thriller... even if you scraped that tacked-on ending away.
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,8,"I know nothing about the Cloverfield franchise - and I had no interest in it before - but I recently heard that JJ Abrams has a habit of attaching the franchise to 2 random indie films to expand on the ""lore"". One of them is good, one of them is not. So this peaked my interest on what all the fuss is for Cloverfield and why everyone was watching its ""blood-relatives"". So I'm watching them in non-chronological order.But how was 10 Cloverfield Lane? If it weren't for that stupid last 10 minutes, it's actually fantastic. It's claustrophobic, suspenseful, smart, well-crafted, and reveals many plot points with more elegance than the average horror film. The performances are great, the built-up tension is excellent, the sound-design creepy, the characters are interesting, and the villain is horrifying. At times he seems sympathetic, kind, and charming, but other times a murderous, mentally-disturbed old guy that couldn't be played better by anyone else but John Goodman. It's best if you go in with no expectations or knowledge of the plot to let the clever script toy with your emotions more. But that doesn't mean you'll get a modern masterpiece. Some moments felt like they dragged on longer than they should and the silly ending loses a lot of tension. All the praise I've gushed about was apparent for most of the film, but at the very end producer JJ Abrams let the filmmakers reshoot a few scenes to let the Cloverfield lore shoved in in the most unsubtle way possible. It doesn't ruin the film, but it DID ruin a few scenes that were building up to something only to forget why it was even there. I'm not entirely sure if changing the ending will still make the film a flawless one as it does feel 15 minutes too long, but it wouldn't suddenly shift to sci-fi.It's still a solid, entertaining, and bone-chilling thriller that had the potential to be great but ended up being really good. If you have the weird Cloverfield interest that I have now, go watch. If you're not interested in Cloverfield, go watch. If you're a fan of Scott Pilgrim, then Ramona is the main lead. So... go watch!"
" Not what it seems
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,7,"To begin with the movie holds you going, with a mystery so conveniently drawn that you have to keep watching. This kind of tensions-driven unclarity is the only interesting part of the first act. The second act tho! is soooo good that it hold the whole movie standing, and without the abusing undertone, this movie would have been a complete flop. Jumping ahead to the final act, which is... well... surprising. I must admit that I'm really not a fan of those type of endings, but it's still an enjoyable refreshment from the claws of cliché-hollywood! 
It may sound like i didn't like this movie, but that's not the case! I just didn't like all of the decisions from the production. The actors are great! especially John Goodman, who is portraying this love-hate character in the perfect resemblance of.... oh! no spoilers ;)"
" Makes Paranormal Activity look legit.
",2018-02-16 00:00:00,2,"I haven't realized that there were sequels to the questionable Cloverfield until I've watched The Cloverfield Paradox, and, while that movie doesn't deserve a particular review and could be summed up with ""Mediocre, but passable"" - this one really, really shocked me. In a bad way. What was the point of this movie?Okay, the original Cloverfield has found footage, lots of CGI, franchise-setting aliens(years before Pacific Rim), some hero interaction, some hero action, but, of course, all within the ridiculously panned out camera capture. Still, it was ""original"". Cloverfield Paradox, again, tries to at least... add to the story. Somehow. It... tries, something already seen many times before, but still tries.What is ""this""? Mystery? How the hell is it a mystery? Horror? Eh...drama? That's a two hours worth of cheap sound effects that start nowhere, go nowhere and end up nowhere. That's what.So what do we have? Apparently a basic b*. Who is running away... or something. Who has an accident, wakes up, finds herself hurt(duh) and... guess what... taken care of! With medical stuff and even a leg brace. And... that she is shackled to the wall. What's her first reaction? Well, most adequate people would probably call out, or at least analyze the situation. Because maybe whoever took care of her - doesn't want her to wander around, just like nobody wants patients to run around form the hospital. Pretty basic stuff. What does she do? All kinds of idiocy. All to find out that the mysterious savior... brought her food. Instead of any kind of normal exchange, she goes out like she is in some Saw movie: ""Please, please, don't hurt me"". Damn, the b* deserves to be done right there. But - the man gives her the crutches and the key... tells her to get accustomed. Wow. Okay. So how does she react? She sets off a fire alarm, sharpens the edge of a crutch and tries to assault the man. Wow. Hilarious. Injured, debilitated, hungry, not knowing ""anything"" - she tries to take out the man, who clearly tries to keep her alive. This is some JarJar Abrams level of script here. I bet the director asked: ""So how the duck am I supposed to shoot that bull?"" And the answer was: ""Oh... come on... make it mysterious or scary or something. This is the best we've got and the franchise needs milking, so unless you don't want you paycheck, you better think of a way to make it happen. Don't worry about the audience. If they were dumb enough to like Cloverfield, they aren't going to complain"".Anyhow, over the next hour we find out that there is another guy, that the situation outside is actually bad, that living inside isn't too bad, yadda-yadda. All would seem reasonable to have a more practical talk by now. Instead... we get a scene, where our Wonder Woman(WW is probably only the 2nd dumbest female in movies, right after this one) crawls to a power room to reset the air conditioning and she finds... Well, supposed evidence that the man, who saved them - is probably lying. Later it goes down the road of Dawn of Justice: ""If there is even 1% chance that he is bad, we HAVE to take that chance!"" So... instead of setting up a controlled situation, where they can confront him... verbally, we get a lot of montage. Which, in the end, results in a pretty forced situation, where the man, who already suffered quite a bit from their presence, finds out that they are planning something. And, in the most fluffy way, the guy decides to take the fall for the girl. And he does that just the right way. Instead of either trying a lie, or at least saying something plausible, he says that was making a ""weapon"", so that he could ""take out"" the man and be ""the hero"" to our girl. Wow. The level of stupidity here has surpassed 9000. So, it's supposed to be a shock that the man straight up shoots him.From there on, the movie gets to the worst part - the most forced and unlikely escape, some alien activity outside, our girl single-handedly taking out an alien spaceship and braving out to help the people in hospital. Because she is, apparently, a clothes designer, who managed to do a few tiny stitches and who just got balls enough to go Ripley.I don't even know why I give this two stars. Maybe because the heroes tried to act... particularly the anti-hero. He really carried this movie. And because it's a Cloverfield movie and I was dumb enough to watch it for that. Because there are no redeemable qualities in this movie. No plot, no lore, no franchise ties, nothing. It's a horrible, unthinkable, C-level script that got the funding, the greenlight and the franchise name in the title. It could literally be the worst movies of late, if it was some indie movie. You just change the finale slightly, ever so slightly, and 90% of the movie can stay EXACTLY the same.
In the end, we find out that the man was indeed a bit paranoid. And had a quarrel with his wife. Yes, apparently it wasn't the wife, who took the daughter. It was him. Absolutely common case of denial. And now he wanted to save another girl, clearly SAVE, and raise instead. Yes, he didn't want that guy in there, but... as long as he behaved, he wasn't an issue. Some time could've gone by, they could've bonded, he may even have seen reason. If they would all get cleared and try to escape the house, fighting off aliens and trying to get to the survivors - I'd give this 6-7\10. Easily. Because if the movie dedicated more time to the actual franchise, whose name it carries, and if it had the script that made even the basic modern level of stoned sense - it could, again, be passable, if not decent.Unfortunately, the movies doesn't do it. Doesn't do anything. It spits on you, it sits on you, it wastes your time, trying to exaggerate every possible situation, make every possible mistake and in the end - force the most predictable outcome. This is a clear example of how NOT to write movies. Because, lord be my witness, I've seen more creativity from Paranormal Activity parodies. The dirty and explicit ones. Ugh...."
" Very entertaining movie, on various levels
",2018-02-13 00:00:00,7,"10 Cloverfield Lane is not a sequel, but more a tie in, or a side story. Like the original it builds on claustrophobia and not really knowing.A woman (Winstead) gets into an accident and wakes up in a cellar in the ground, owned by John Goodman. Goodman welcomes and helps her, but doesn't intent to let her go, because happenings outside that sound to crrazy to be true. This gives the feeling of a creepy, claustrophobic atmosphere, where that which is safe, feels dangerous. There the cat and mouse game begins, and Winstead is a prisoner hellbent on escaping, while trying to keep Goodmans thrust. The question is raised, will she be able to go, and if she does, what will she encounter?The movie works as a horror movie and a thriller. Goodman is perfect as the crazy guy with good intentions. Winstead is strong as the empowered victim. Together they carry a movie where for a long time nothing happens, but with palpable tension. And although movies like Cloverfield Paradox will make you stop wanting to see more about Cloverfield, 10 Cloverfield Lane will make you ask for more."
" A clearly tacked on ending lowered the quality
",2018-02-08 00:00:00,6,"The main story before and in the bunker was quite good. I did expect some kind of connection to the original Cloverfield movie but not the rushed action sequence of the ending. It would have been better to have some kind of a reveal in the end where maybe something Cloverfield related is seen in the distance like when she looks up and sees living birds, she then sees something in the distance. But we instead get an ending action sequence which seems to have been hurrying tacked onto the the main story. It deflated the quality of the rest of the story. It also uses a technique in the last act with which I am quite bored. The final action scene is in the dark. Too many movies shoot CGI heavy scenes in the dark. I think that it is a cost saving thing. In the case with this movie, it transitions from day to might too quickly, almost like the rest of the movie was already filmed and the final act was tacked on but on a budget. It doesn't totally spoil the movie. It will depend on where the franchise goes since the end scene was basically a cliffhanger."
" Mind-Screwing In A Good Way
",2018-02-07 00:00:00,7,"10 Cloverfield Lane, in short, is about a creepy dude, Howard (John Goodman), who claims there's been a chemical attack and that's the reasoning behind keeping a young woman, Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), locked in a shelter under his equally-creepy farmhouse.Michelle doesn't believe it, she thinks he's kidnapped her. She was in a car crash, and Creepy Dude saved her. Ok, sure, but let's go to the hospital, demands Michelle. Nope, the air is poisoned, creepy Howard confidently tells Michelle, who by now is really sketched out. Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) is also locked in the shelter, but he says it's by his choice. He knew about the shelter because he saw Creepy Dud building it a long time ago, so when the attack happened, Emmett rushed over to the farmhouse and essentially forced his way in. Sounds believable, right? Even Creepy Dude is locked in the shelter with them. Is Emmett in on this thing, too?The story is pretty good and keeps you in the dark. Is creepy Howard telling the truth, or is he brainwashing these two victims? There's evidence of both. Creepy Dude keeps reminding Michelle that he saved her life and she should be a little more grateful. Can't she understand that? Creepy Dude is prone to violent outbursts, but don't worry he won't hurt you, it's just the stress. After all, no one really knows how long they'll all be underground. One year, two? That'll stress anyone out, for sure. Everything is pretty convincing; everyone's story makes sense. You'll be like, WTF?I like horror movies that focus less on gore and more on storytelling to scare. This is one of those movies. It's trippy and mind-screwing in a good way. 10 Cloverfield Lane is well done."
" A Very Decent Cloverfield Spin-Off
",2018-02-07 00:00:00,6,"10 Cloverfield Lane is a tense thriller carried by great performances from John Goodman & Mary Elizabeth Winstead. This isn't really a sequel to 2008's Cloverfield though; more like a spin-off, with a different story taking place in a different part of the world. While Cloverfield jumped onto a current trend at that time (""found footage""), this film feels more old-fashioned in style.Dan Trachtenberg's film is less visually engaging than it could have been, but this is solid entertainment, a film meant to keep you guessing before it throws you back into the world to argue about its ending. The sense of uneasiness you get at times is certainly there in the script, but it's Goodman's performance that makes your skin crawl. He captures a man on the edge of sanity for whom control is key. He's not an obvious maniac, but someone who honestly thinks he's a savior. Goodman keeps us guessing, allowing glimpses of the possibly kind man that Howard used to be.In terms of performance, Winstead matches Goodman in every way. She helps carry carry 10 Cloverfield Lane, conveying Michelle's conflicted feelings about her predicament and staying completely in the moment that the tension remains.The final 30 minutes of the movie is pretty much going to dominate conversation. Without spoiling anything, it's a series of events in which Michelle finds new challenges around every corner, and while I'm not sure it's as solid as it could have been, Winstead and the filmmakers keep it working through sheer confidence.The visuals this time around aren't as overwhelming as they are in Cloverfield, but that can just reiterate the point that a film doesn't need to be laden with special effects to be any good. Investing in decent performances & story can be more key to making a film enjoyable than relying on amazing visuals.10 Cloverfield lane is definitely worth a watch and it's nice to take a break from the usual ""found footage"" Horror/Thrillers that seem to dominate at times."
" INTENSE!
",2018-02-07 00:00:00,10,"10 Cloverfield Lane follows a woman taken against her will to a safety shelter. There she's told the air outside is dangerous and she brought there for her own safety. She soon learns there is a monster inside, that frightens her much more then the threat of the outside world.10 Cloverfield Lane is a surprising sequel that I doubt anyone saw coming. it doesn't rely on monster effects like the first Cloverfield did. Instead quarantines a few charcters and relies on their performances.John Goodman was snubbed from the academy awards when he wasn't nominated for best supporting actor.
He is so intense it's amazing.
Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. Both provide great performances too.This film has a lot to offer, even if you weren't a fan of the first Cloverfield.
I can't recommend this one enough. It's a masterpiece."
" Interesting plotline but wtf is the ending??
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,6,"There was a slow beginning where I thought the fat guy was kind of weird. But after her attempt to escape, I started to think that he was normal. BUT then after that twist halfway through the movie, I was like what the F**K he's a weirdo again. But kudos to the lady for figuring out what's happening and actually using her knowledge to save herself. One thing I didn't like was the ending cause it was completely different from the rest of the plot. I read other reviews and they also thought the ending ruined the entire movie. What a shame...I would have given it a way higher rating if not for the terrible ending"
" Thrill ride
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,8,10 Cloverfield Lane - 2nd in the franchise episode comes with a good and fresh horror in thriller genre. Survival of the fittest concept .
" Excellent
",2018-02-06 00:00:00,9,"I enjoy this movie more every time I watch it. I love claustrophobic horror/thriller movies. This movie does that very well. It tells a great story and keeps you interested with only three characters in a very tight space. The acting is all spot on, especially from MEW and Goodman. Goodman plays a creepy survivalist and does it well. MEW shows a great range of emotion and plays a very strong survivor. I am not sure how much this movie actually connects to Cloverfield, but as a stand alone movie it is excellent. The music is great in this movie also, it leads the mood and emotion of the film. Most movies these days don't have music that stands out at all..it is just there, that's it. The music here sticks with you and is creepy. This is an underrated movie that you should definitely check out. Don't let the Cloverfield name fool you, it is a very different type of movie from Cloverfield."
" Good, Suspenseful Flick!
",2018-01-20 00:00:00,6,"John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead star in this 2016 sci-fi-thriller. Winstead (Live Free or Die Hard) plays young woman, Michelle who gets into a car accident and is nursed by stranger, Howard (Goodman) who tells her that it's unsafe up top his underground bunker where he keeps her due to a deadly gas contamination. She starts to get suspicious of Howard and wonders if he's telling the truth or not. This is a good, suspenseful flick, Goodman & Winstead are great in it as well as the score. I recommend this."
" Sometimes Scary, Sometimes Very Slow
",2018-01-06 00:00:00,6,"I love the original 2008's Cloverfield as it is a strikingly powerful shaky camera horror-packed thriller with astounding tempo and impending doom looming over. This is a kind of sequel albeit a very distant and sometimes not at all, as much of the time this is a dense psychological thriller and not a monster attacj flick. 
What was right, was the casting of menacing John Goodman and awesome Mary Elizabeth Winstead as main parts. They do their job well, keeping this often achingly slow-pacing film somewaht feasible. 
What was wrong, was the pacing, the finalle and the whole lenghth - it could've done a way better were it shorter and faster. Thus, a good isea is somewhat marred and spoilt by a jarring slow tempo and some very wrong plot turns.
I hope the third part of Cloverfield saga would turn up better and ore consistent as this second suffers a lot from what was mentioned above."
" Chills and frills that keeps us guessing
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,8,"Excellent acting and a story line that keeps us guessing about the true nature of the film. That fact was a little obvious after the second turn in the story, but it had more turns in store. Is this inspired by Silence of the lambs, zombies or The mist (S.King) all at once? It is less strange and more strange at the same time. It has lots of nice touches from horror classics (solubilizing victims, the Alien), to bits of lovely french references (which could be horror for the englishes). The story evolves and we are kept in the dark long enough to long for an answer, damn the consequences, like our heroine. Super good special effects with the aliens invadors. Flaws though: how can the generator be working so long; how can the air be so well filtered; how can she throw up so high; how can alcohol be right there when you need it. Details that don't distract too much from the action, humoristic at times. Excellent film!"
" Loved it!
",2017-12-29 00:00:00,9,"I loved the movie, especially the ending which came from no where. I kept guessing what would happen next and it kept going other way every time which doesn't happen very often. 10 Cloverfield Lane is beautifully written thriller which every thrill loving person must watch. First I was finding similarity with the movie ""The Room (2015)"" but after sometime things got more interesting and the ending was totally unexpected and somewhat funny. Totally not what I expect."
" You are not ready for this
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,8,"A girl (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) survives a car accident and wakes in a nuclear shelter run by older man (John Goodman) who claims that something major has happened overground and they can only survive by down here.There's another survivor as well (John Gallagher Jr.), who seems more together mentally, but still agrees with the owner...""10 Cloverfield Lane"" was released in March 2016, and got a wide release, so there's good chance that you have seen it already or heard about it.For those lucky ones who still have a chance of seeing it fresh, I am not gonna write much.Watch it and enjoy, because this is a movie lover's delight - original, tightly written and well played thriller that builds suspense and keeps you guessing till the very end.Most of the story takes place in underground shelter with just three actors yet it never feels like a play. It's a proper movie, and strikingly good one at that.Freakin' loved it! Would have been a tight one even without..."
" Odd but effective mix of genres
",2017-12-07 00:00:00,8,"Most of ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a psychological thriller as a young women (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) wakes up in an underground shelter following a car accident, only to find that she is essentially a prisoner of an erratic and unbalanced survivalist (John Goodman). Goodman's character is her only source of information and the first act revolves around her assumption that he's lying when he tells her that the world outside the shelter has been destroyed and the air is unbreathable (despite claims of the shelters third occupant to have seen a flash in the sky before fighting his way into the shelter). Winstead is very good in the role of the desperate trapped women, who is both capable and resourceful and whose actions and behaviour, with in the context of the story, are realistic and compelling. Goodman's unbalanced survivalist is also very good, especially as his version of what has happened/is happening begins to unravel, and his guests/captives become first suspicious, then terrified. The film ends with the revelation of what has occurred beyond the walls of the shelter, linking the titular address with the kaiju film ""Cloverfield"" (albeit obliquely). All-in-all, an interesting and well-made apocalyptic thriller with an interesting twist on the 'unreliable narrator' and a somewhat unexpected ending that (based on reviews) viewers many find satisfying, intriguing, or preposterous."
" the cloverfield monster was tact on and unneeded
",2017-11-30 00:00:00,4,"its hard recommending this movie, because while the script and acting is pretty good, the ending is just nonsense. i understand the writers wanted to tie this into the other cloverfield movie, but it just ruined an ending that could have really sold the movie. its about 3 people trapped in an underground bunker together, and the mystery is whether the man who ""saved"" them is actually a hero or a maniac just keeping them there. and all of a sudden, aliens. okay? terrible ending, just terrible."

He claims the air outside is poisonous. She also occupies the shelter with Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) a local who helped build the shelter.Howard is strange and Michelle doubts his story of Russians or aliens poisoning our air. Howard rules with an iron fist and Michell fears for her life, trapped between the devil she knows and the one that may be outside.The film was an interesting concept. I wished they had played a clip from the 1961 Twilight Zone episode ""The Shelter"" on Howard's TV instead of ""Pretty in Pink."" As always, Goodman delivers. Definitely worth adding to the collection.Guide: 1 F-word. No sex or nudity."
" Bad Bad Bad
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,1,"The story unfolds way too fast for it to be a real thriller. the characters are flat and not relatable. If there was any shred of hope for this movie, the ludicrous ending was the final nail in the coffin. Avoid at all costs."
" A claustrophobic thriller that benefits from its small cast
",2017-10-25 00:00:00,10,"So when I first heard about this movie, I thought it looked stupid. Of course I didn't know much about this movie, but I still held rather low expectations for this movie. I thought initially ""okay she just has to figure why she's in the bunker that's not too exciting"". BOY WAS I WRONG. This movie exceeded my expectations by a long shot. It kept me intrigued with an exhilarating story line. It developed really good characters based off of strong performances from all the actors, especially John Goodman. I'd argue that this is one of his best movies of all time. This movie also feels very claustrophobic. This movie made me feel like I was there with them in the bunker, figuring out why I was there. And I loved it. I always admire movies that are able to draw me into a world and keep me there until the credits roll. The cinematography and writing for this movie are both phenomenal. The acting and directing is just incomprehensibly good. And the ending is very unexpected, but I found it very intriguing and fascinating. One more thought. What I think is the best part about this movie is its ability to blend genres. This movie takes aspects of horror, thriller, suspense, mystery, sci-fi, drama, and even a couple comedic moments and makes a stunning movie. It's impossible to confine it to one genre since it fits so well amongst multiple genres. I am very satisfied with what I was presented with with this movie. I highly recommend you check it out! If you have Amazon Prime, you can watch it free on Amazon Prime Video!"
" A Good Movie Up To a Point: How J.J. Ruined Everything
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,8,"Spoilers Throughout!!!! You've been warned.Here's how I envision the meeting: ""Guys, guys, listen, if you want J.J. to put his name on it, you need to cheapen your artistic tastes a bit. You need to tie it in to something science fiction, I don't know, like War of the Worlds.""""But it's a really great story that has nothing to do with science fiction.""""That's the problem. You know he's going to slap ""cloverfield"" in the title of the next thing he does, to let audiences know they can expect something great.""""But this has nothing to do with giant monsters and crappy cinematography or gimmicks.""""Well, if you want J.J. to sign off on it, you better make it tie in to science fiction. He's got an image to maintain.""""What if we put a spaceship and an alien dog at the end?""""Perfect! J.J.'ll love it.""Can you tell I really don't care for J.J. Abrams' body of work? Somehow I can't help feeling that if he was an interior decorator, he'd specialize in bordellos and black velvet paintings. I like good science fiction, aliens, and the unknown when done well. 10 Clover, while being a good story and having science fiction, aliens, and the unknown, does everything right but the first two of those three things. Having said that, here's what I have to say about the actual movie.Brief synopsis: Woman packs her things and leaves someone. Drives along at night and has a wreck. Wakens to find herself in a shelter with two men. Tension builds. Climax occurs. Heroine escapes. Aliens appear on screen. Heroine has that ""Give me a break"" moment. She defeats one alien while the other inexplicably leaves her alone. She runs off to join resistance. The lesson: Survivors of abuse have medical and military experience and can fight aliens.You can trust what others said about the movie never dragging. It moves briskly along, and it carries the viewer well for the most part. Part of Abrams' influence, I think, is the need to keep moving to hold the audience's attention. That's about the best I can say for almost any story that J.J. puts his name on. This movie rises well above the rest however for a number of reasons:Performances were decent, and John Goodman delivers one clearly among his best. Every detail matters. If you're paying attention, like our protagonist, you'll see that one of the things the writers did well was to ensure that every word and detail mattered to the outcome of the story. If you missed that fact, go back and really pay attention to all the little details. I don't want to give them away, so no spoilers here.Someone mentioned that the protagonist was a little too capable, but I'm not so sure. I think it works well. I think that the main difference is that the protagonist is engaged in her circumstances instead of remaining pedestrian and victim like so many others. What kept this from becoming a true horror movie is that she kept her wits and used what she knew to good effect.Proof that you don't need tons of money or huge sets to tell a good story. I think this is one that students should study, not only for where it went right, but also for where it went wrong.Kowtowing to Abrams' ego seems mostly restricted to the last few minutes of the movie--which, I might add, is the only part of the movie that drags. I don't remember seeing a single lens flare.Now the bad:The ending felt tacked on to me. Someone else blamed J.J., and I have to agree. It felt like J.J. blundering about. While I enjoyed the movie and the ending, to a degree, it didn't feel like it had the same meticulous carefulness that the rest of the scenes displayed. I think they went back and inserted the woman at the door afterward so that they could tie in to the outcome somewhat. It still feels tacked on."
" Winstead is terrific in this tight thriller that keeps you guessing.
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,8,"A crackerjack of a film that keeps the audience guessing from beginning to end. Co- written by Damien Chazelle, who wrote and directed La La Land, and produced by J.J. Abrams, who produced the other ""Cloverfield"" movie about a giant Godzilla-like creature attacking NYC. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a very different kind of story about Mary Elizabeth Winstead knocked unconscious in a car wreck only to find herself locked in an underground shelter by John Goodman, who tells her there has been some kind of incident or outbreak out in the world and that they must remain in the bunker to stay safe. Is she a prisoner? Is Goodman her savior or completely insane? Does she risk trying to escape, angering Goodman or facing the unknown outside? John Gallagher Jr. plays a third character also confined to the bunker, similarly brought there by Goodman and unsure if he's been saved or is a prisoner. These types of bottle-stories, with a group of characters confined to a small space, whether it's high art with ""Death and the Maiden"" or whether it's exciting pulp as with something like ""The Thing,"" are incredibly fun when they are done well and this one is done amazingly well. Winstead is quickly becoming one of my favorite actresses after this and following a great performance in season three of ""Fargo"" (along with discovering her singing career with Dan the Automator in ""Got a Girl""). Goodman is terrific in his ambivalent performance where you cannot figure out if he's a devil or an angel. Directed by Dan Trachtenberg, who seems to have not made anything else of note before of after this, tightly directs the film, building incredible suspense at times, while also giving time for the characters to become fully fleshed out. SPOILER ALERT! I felt the film did go a bit off the rails at the end when Winstead does finally escape and she has to fight off giant space monsters. Don't get me wrong, it's all very fun, but it felt like I'd suddenly stepped into another film. It may conceptually be an interesting ending in that it ties this to a larger J.J. Abrams Cloverfield universe, but this film taken on it's own, it felt strange and unnecessary, especially considering how small and confined a majority of the film was to then suddenly get dropped into the middle of a giant Michael Bay Transformers movie (though maybe that was the intent). Still, ""Cloverfield 10 Lane"" is an exciting, suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat kind of film that is a must see for fans of this sort of film. If you enjoy this type of set up, I'd recommend Xavier Gens' horror/thriller ""The Divide"" about a group of survivors in a fallout shelter after a nuclear attack, although I have to warn you it's a pretty rough ride."
" Claustrophobic Fun
",2017-10-14 00:00:00,9,"What if you were in a car accident, and your rescuer was a crazy doomsday prepper, and it's officially doomsday? Well, you get this, a tight, claustrophobic and altogether freaky dynamic between a makeshift family that surely features at least one creepy secret. Settings like these are rife for creating character tension, and that is done quite successfully. We get our nice lull, where it seems everything is going to be fine, until the secret is exposed and Michelle and Emmett make their choices to push through the third act.All three primary cast members are terrific, and the tension between them is very real. John Goodman is especially outstanding with Howard's increasingly bizarre behavior, and insistence that he be treated a certain way. And the mystery surrounding what went on outside never quite abates, and is put up as something that we, the audience, must know at some point. The nuance weaves through the interactions between the characters, and we are left to wait for the other shoe to drop, and when it does, the conclusion is a fantastic payoff."
" It could have been shorter
",2017-10-11 00:00:00,7,"There are not many movies that can glue you to the screen with only 3 main characters, and 10CL is one of them. Whenever you thought you were right, the movie proved you wrong again and again. It's good that they still make this kind of movies nowadays. It had its dull moments, but not for long. As the time went, you became hooked to the story, wanting to know more. All actors/actress did great jobs in the movie. I gave it only 7 because it could have been shorter."
" Very good, ending lousy and awful
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,3,"Surprisingly good start for a movie, i've never seen this concept kind of movie. So that's really good, the mystery of what's going on. The ending however made everything look like a joke. It didn't fit at all, i had a completely different idea of how it was going to end, not in this science fiction stuff. Bad idea. Not going to watch the sequel."
" Excellent
",2017-10-10 00:00:00,10,I have never written a review or even thought about it. This is the first movie I've seen in a very long time that kept me on the edge of my seat. I was bored looking for a movie. Saw John Goodman and decided to watch. I am seriously recommending this movie to everyone I know. You could never predict the outcome.
" Starts out good. Seems that they ran out of money and had to end quickly.
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,1,"Most of the movie was suspenseful and you really want to know what's going on. But towards the end you will say: ""You've gotta be kidding me!"" Like a slap in the face with a wet rag. That was a lousy excuse for an ending. The rating dropped from 6.5 instantly to 1 (awful) Unfortunately it leaves room for a sequel."
" Did more than just be ""famous""
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,9,"PROS: To start off, the build up of tension in this movie was so well placed. There were places where the intensity was at a low, and this allowed for a deeper look into the characters that you wouldn't normally see in a horror movie. You would watch something take place and it would build and build until the climax, then there would be a beautiful compilation of character development and depth to the plot. This was all wrapped up by a masterful ending. As the watcher you want and ending that leaves you with questions but still gives you some answered, and it's the directors job to decide what questions are OK to be unanswered. This movie was the perfect balance of good acting and good directing. CONS: Although I liked the ending I felt it was very out of the realm for what should be expected. I like how the movie connects to it's films relative, I just didn't expect it and for some people it could've been too unpredictable for their liking.www.chorror.com"
" 7.5 is a 7 right ?
",2017-09-06 00:00:00,8,"This was very much more than i expected,in a good way. From the start of the movie,the music and sound effects took my ears into the movie's world.My attention to the movie kept increasing with it as well not just in the start. It was very harmonic with the movie and was a huge asset to me liking the movie if i am honest. The director,the scenario, and of course the acting was other elements non the less that also amazed me and kept me on the edge of my seat. John Goodman delivers an Oscar worthy performance with such a complex character and so much details in the character and no time to build it up but he did it all and delivered me the complete feeling of the character. Marry, i didn't see her before this in anything but this was so good too very much into the survivor character. The only thing that wasn't good for me was the last 20 minutes ""the aliens part"". I mean it is a good thing for endings to be ""not see that one coming"" type but this was so far and i accepted it but there must have been any good build up to lead to it not just throw it to the watchers and hoping they accept it.Though,i liked her decision at the end where she decides to fight that was good. Overall it was a good movie just didn't like the ending that much but yet a new idea and good movie to watch. 7.5/10"
" John Goodman owns the film
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,8,"Over the years, John Goodman has matured into an accomplished actor, and here he hauls out every nuance he's honed during his long career. At turns he is either folksy or terrifying, transforming from one to the other within seconds. The only other actor I can think of who has added this kind of depth and range in his later years would be Michael McKean and his outstanding performance in Better Call Saul.Unfortunately if we're talking about believable actors and their contribution to a willing suspension of disbelief, Mary Winstead and John Gallagher are just okay; neither one of them is very convincing in their respective roles. Michelle should be terrified and isn't, not even at the very end when she casually kills a giant monster with a molotov cocktail, something every dressmaker instinctively knows how to do. Emmett is a dimwit who isn't enough of a dimwit. Either go full dimwit or not at all, there is no in-between. I couldn't figure out why Howard even let him into the bunker, what purpose does he serve?The drama is gripping for 75% of the film until it turns into something very different and unexpected, as implied above, the end scene hinting at the now mandatory franchise serialization cliff hanger demanded by the bean-counters at all the major studios so the next film in the series can hook onto it. It's disappointing and pretentious but what are you going to do, it is what it is."
" Oh, come on
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,1,"If you want tension stick your fingers in an electrical socket. If you want to feel on the edge of your seat, sit on the edge of a chair. But just don't watch this soulless sackful of sour grapes.This is as subtle as 'american' can get. This is entertainment for the intellectually debilitated brats of the smartphone era. No nuanced performances from any of the 'performers' at any point of this catatonic attempt at breakdance. You just gotta love the protagonist grunting and panting and sighing and gasping and heaving and huffing and puffing and grasping for air all the same perfectly made up with no smudged mascara.If you absolutely must, make sure you bring a trashy newspaper or read a magazine in the meantime, no need to pay close attention to the on screen action, this is Brazilian soap opera pacing at its best. With acting to match.Oh, if that weren't enough, the 'story' blows, too, like the alien 'ship' set on fire with a makeshift molotov cocktail which just happened to lie about on a car seat in the last scene."
" Oka~y ....
",2017-08-10 00:00:00,4,first thing first ... i really don't know how this movie is a 7 ..OK its a good movie and good acting and everything .. but the story haven't built right .. the director wanted to do a twist so badly that he missed up everything at first you'll like the movie a lot .. oh and btw they really need to change the movie description here its so wrong i wont say any spoilers ... just ask a friend who watched it don't trust the rating on this onei think it worth a 5 stars max.
" Rating: A
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,9,"This is an amazing claustrophobic thriller with a major part of the runtime spent in just one confined space. Starting with the pros, I have to congratulate the director Dan Trachtenberg because this was his first feature film and it was brilliant, full of tension and suspense.Then, the actors: all of them were great  John Goodman as Howard is perfect! You know that he did an awesome job when you spend the whole movie unable to figure out if he's really insane or not. In one scene, he may seem crazy, but in the next one he's completely normal and that makes us and our hero, Jessica, with no idea of what's true or not. Mary Elizabeth Winstead is also really great, probably her best performance so far and her character is definitely someone who you care for. Usually, in this type of movies, the hero is not really smart and does things that are nowhere near rational, but in this movie she is and she's ahead of Howard, most of the time.John Gallagher Jr. plays Emmett and he also gives a good performance. However, his character was not as compelling as the others and that's fine since this movie concerned more Howard and Jessica. Still, he was in the moment of the movie where my jaw just dropped of how intense that scene was. This movie gives small hints along the way (book in a shelf, someone's former profession ) and, if you connect all of them, the ending will not come as a surprise (only if you've seen Cloverfield, which was a ""prequel"" to this film  I will talk about it at the end of the review and after my rating since it has a minor spoiler for 10 Cloverfield Lane).The ending felt rushed, it's really abrupt and it can leave you a little disappointed, at first. After thinking about all the hints given through the movie, the sounds that were heard and some dialogues, you connect everything and it doesn't feel that fast anymore, so it actually worked for me.————————-MINOR SPOILER WARNING————————-In Cloverfield, there was a giant monster destroying everything and, at the end of the movie, there's a flashback where, in the background, you can see a dark point falling from the sky (really easy to miss). That was a satellite (Howard's former profession involved working with satellites) and it, supposedly, woke up the Cloverfield monster.Knowing this, the end of 10 Cloverfield Lane will make more sense to you and, in some way, will smooth away the rushed ending.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" A nice little chamber thriller
",2017-08-05 00:00:00,8,"Mary Elizabeth Winstead gets into a car accident and wakes up in a bunker owned by John Goodman. Goodman tells her that a world ending event is going on outside and he saved her life. She thinks that maybe he's nuts and just kidnapped her. She stays in the bunker with Goodman and workman John Gallagher Jr. (who believes Goodman and fought to get in), not sure which way the preponderance of evidence really points. This taut little thriller is essentially a 3 person chamber piece anchored by a very strong performance by Goodman and equally good work from Winstead. It probably should have ended 10 minutes before it does."
" Fantastic, gripping, thoroughly enjoyable, until the final part ruins it...
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,5,"I give the 5/10 out of the credit I owe to the original writers of the fascinating psychological horror that takes place inside the bunker. The mystery is compelling: Is Howard telling the truth? Is there any real threat outside? Is Howard a crazy child-abusing maniac? Did he plan all this to own Michelle? etc. I could all go on pretty well had the film ended with the heroine's escape, but then, all of a sudden, what the? REAL ALIENS? Are you kidding me? Just how ""lost"" are you Mr. Abrams?! You turned the fantastic, gripping thriller about a deranged paranoid old man into a totally irrelevant tale of worm aliens taking over the earth? The ending ruins everything. The character of Michelle was well portrayed as a woman running away from problems instead of facing them, finally managing to ""grow up"" and learn to fight her problems. The ending, however, turns her into a completely different person. From a timid girlfriend, Michelle turns into an alien- smacking badass chick straight out of a classic sci-fi alien flick who blows up a giant alien invader with a bottle of liquor and a matchbox and, not frightened in the least, decides to take the fight to the aliens herself. The movie begins and proceeds as a psychological thriller/drama about paranoia, claustrophobia, and insanity and in a split second turns into the worst moments of the Resident Evil franchise. I literally thought I was watching a remake of the ending of The Thing, with the same actress and all. Great job uncle J.J., you did it again. Had I know he was involved in the plot, I would've thought twice before watching this film. You CAN enjoy this film, just turn if off as soon as the hero goes free. keep watching and it'll turn all the fun you had into utter disappointment, frustration, and resentment."
" Amazing movie
",2017-08-02 00:00:00,10,"This movie is greet. 10 Cloverfield Lane gives all the development and the meaningful story that its blood relative installment lacked completely. This is not a spectacle full of screams and special effects. This is a spectacle of tension and suspense of epic proportions. This is a really feel-bad movie at certain points.First of all, you have to take the leap of faith and go ahead watching without knowing anything of the plot. Don't worry because all the teasers doesn't reveal anything important, but don't try to search information. If everything were that easy, even Hitchcock or Nolan movies would lose all interest.I was extremely hooked since the furious start to the eye popping and surprising finale. The direction is amazing and claustrophobic. The performances are great, looking up to a surprising Winstead and a unrestrained unforgettable turn by Goodman. The story is gleefully unapologetic delivering chills and full blooded twists (the biggest of all is the intense ending reveal) even thought it deviates from the monster.Secretly made, impeccably marketed, nicely developed and finally here along with us: 10 Cloverfield Lane promised thrills and delivered it and then some. I was expecting some things that I tasted but I was surprised by a complexity and a twisted sense of horror that I didn't see coming. 2016 has released the very first great movie of the year."
" 10 Cloverfield Lane is Amazing.
",2017-08-02 00:00:00,10,"10 Cloverfield Lane tells Hollywood that you don't need a large cast and a bigger budget to make a film Amazing, with only just a 15 Million Dollar budget and with only 9 people and two A-Listers, John Goodman and Bradly Cooper as the Voice of Ben are Fantastic. In Conclusion this movie is a must watch."
" Enjoyed 10 Cloverfield Lane pretty much.
",2017-07-29 00:00:00,8,"To make a good thriller movie, There are three elements need to be well made in my point of view. These elements are the plot, the cinematography, and the movie score. 10 Cloverfield Lane is one of a few great suspense, mystery movies that fulfilled the three elements successfully. This movie takes you on an unsettling creepy journey to get answers for many questions in a smart young women's head wants to reach a logical resolution to what happened to her. you can touch the tension level increases gradually from the beginning of the film tell the end. The music score is insanely amazing. It hooks you once the movie starts. I really want to thank Bear McCreary for this score. No one can deny the amazing performance of John Goodman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. I can't wait to see the next project of the ambitious director, Dan Trachtenberg who has a directing talent should be invested well in the future. 10 Cloverfield Lane is definitely worth seeing. I watched it twice in the theater which is, by the way, a rare event to do."
" Absolutely horrible
",2017-07-22 00:00:00,1,"This movie had not a single redeeming quality, the fact that I wasted 2 hours of my life on it and am now spending even more time writing about it is as a courtesy to you, to save you from watching this hunk of sh*t. There was literally no plot. How did anyone truly like this? I'm trying to find what someone was thinking was the plot, but it just isn't coming together and the story had more holes than swiss cheese... the only thing this movie managed to do well was use eerie music to make things seem sinister and dramatic. John Goodman played a terrible role with no depth, gave an empty performance... I was expecting so much more from him. This script gave no one anything to work with."
" Was literally at the edge of my seat!
",2017-07-19 00:00:00,7,"THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN MILD SPOILERS, but honestly nothing more than I'd already gathered from Twitter and talk /reviews on various other forms of social media. Still, you have been warned. Read no further than the following first paragraph if you don't want to risk mild spoilage.10 Cloverfield Lane was surprisingly entertaining. I'm not really a huge fan of movies shot in an enclosed space because, in general, how often does that work out well? (Remember the Ashley Judd movie about bugs? Mmhmm.) However, it worked, and worked well in this. Part of this, no doubt, belongs to the fact that John Goodman put on a freaking amazing performance. That man just OWNED this movie. You knew something wasn't right with him. It was obvious he had some crazy going on. The way he was able to yo-yo between affable and scary, though, was fantastic and kept you guessing as to just how crazy his crazy was. Everything was nailed, from the look in his eyes to the flexing of his hands when he was struggling to keep himself under control. Top- notch!The other two, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr, also brought good performances to the table and perfectly complimented Goodman's acting. Winstead, who has one of those ""I knowwww you..you'reyou were in something I've seen!"" faces (she's actually got quite the list of acting credits to her name), did a great job as a solid female lead. She sold her confusion, wariness, intelligence and strength to you with considerable skill. Great job by Winstead. She didn't shine like Goodman did, but she never faltered either.This movie quite literally had me on the edge of my seat leaning forward, tips of my fingers near my ears at one point because I was expecting bad loudness. Trachtenburg delivered. From the absurd to the affable family moments, and from the crazy-scary to the Cloverfield freakouts, the only weak part of the film really seemed to be the fact that the ending they gave it wasn't really necessary. It would have been just as strong if they'd ended it before it went full Cloverfield. It might have even been stronger. It felt like Trachtenburg gave in to ever-present ""Action! ACTION! WE NEED ACTION!"" push that seems to present in Hollywood now, even if its unnecessary, and then wanted to put everything in a basket with a pretty bow. But ending it right before it went BOO! would have left people walking from the theaters, feeling vaguely disturbed, and talking only about the fantastic performances by the three actors.Overall, great job by all involved and it was definitely worth the price of the tickets, beer, popcorn, and mnms!"
" this is turning out to be a good franchise
",2017-07-15 00:00:00,7,"The 2008 found footage movie ""Cloverfield"" played with the audience by making you think early on that it was a sort of romantic comedy...before the important stuff started. Now comes ""10 Cloverfield Lane"". This movie plays with the audience even more. The main differences are that it's told in third-person narrative, and that it has recognizable faces. But it keeps you guessing about just what is going on.John Goodman puts on one of the most impressive performances of his career, with fine support from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. As to the question of how much the movie relates to the 2008 movie, I'm eager to see where it goes from here, if in fact they make a third movie.Good one."
" How is this director not getting more work?
",2017-07-13 00:00:00,9,"This is a film where the director has an iron-grip on the ""feel"" that he wants each and every scene to exude. Everything from what each character says, how they say it, the little mannerisms they have, the sound, the music--EVERYTHING works together to convey the emotions and view-point of the film's protagonist. Even when you already know what's going to happen, the film still manages to instill the sense of suspicion and unease that our heroine experiences. Of course, while the director gets plenty of kudos for allowing the film to accomplish, the other shining star of the show is Goodman, who absolutely slays it. I find it rather shocking that his performance didn't garner him more award attention."
" It's worth renting, but not a buy in my opinion.
",2017-07-11 00:00:00,7,"10 Cloverfield Lane was a good movie, and definitely one I'd recommend. Was I disappointed I didn't view it in the theater? No. 10 Cloverfield Lane was a good late night movie full of some surprising twists. The plot and pacing of the movie were very well done, but I felt the end and some character arcs lacked a bit in detail. So to finish things off, I decided to give 10 Cloverfield Lane a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or an 7 out of 10. It's worth renting, but not a buy in my opinion.Read more at theVade."
" Less action than in the first film in this belated sequel
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,6,"Belated pseudo-sequel to the divisive 2008 movie Cloverfield. That first film dealt with an unexplained giant monster attack in NYC, and was shot in the ""found footage"" style: everything shot with a video camera, as if by one of the characters within the film, with all the shakiness and amateurishness one would expect. The idea is to lend the film added verisimilitude and place the viewer within the narrative. This works only occasionally, and in my opinion Cloverfield was one time that it did. However, that being said, this sequel does away with that narrative device, and is shot in a traditional, stationary manner, with known actors and professional cinematography.The story follows Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a young woman in an unhappy relationship who packs her bags and hits the road, leaving her boyfriend and driving toward parts unknown. She suffers a terrible car accident, and when she awakens, she's chained up in the underground bomb shelter of the distinctly odd Howard (John Goodman), a conspiracy theorist and survival nut who claims that while Michelle was unconscious, the world up above has come to an end. What caused it, he isn't sure (Russian nukes? Terrorist bio-weapons? Alien invaders?), but he knows it isn't safe to step outside. Also in the shelter is goofy country boy Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), a former employee of Howard's in the construction of the shelter.The vast majority of the movie is a slow-burn suspense drama, as Michelle tries to learn more about her surroundings, and the two roommates she's now forced to live with. You know Howard isn't all there, but just how far gone is he? Or are his most outlandish claims only the tip of the iceberg? These scenes are well-done for the most part, and the actors are all good, especially Goodman, who uses his bulk to great advantage. Winstead does great work as well, using her eyes more than anything to project her performance. The problems for me came in the relatively uninspired script. There wasn't really a beat in the film that I didn't see coming, and all of the characters ended up where I expected them to be within the first 10 minutes. The dialogue, too, while showing a tiny bit of wit here and there, didn't hold my attention as well as I hoped. I won't go into the film's last act, only to say that ""Cloverfield"" is in the title for a reason, but don't expect the giant monster action of the first film. Directorial debut of Dan Trachtenberg. From Paramount."
" I make a case for why I think this movie royally stunk. See if you agree.
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,1,"Okay, so you might be wondering, out of all the positive reviews this movie has gotten, why somebody would give it an awful rating. Well, I'm going to make my case, and I think you will see that I made a valid point. And if not, that's okay, it's just a movie, so we don't have to agree.When this movie was first teased about in the trailers, it was pretty much universally understood that it would be the sequel to the monster movie ""Cloverfield"".Let's just stop right there. If this was supposed to be the sequel to Cloverfield, I think it may have beaten Halloween 3 as the worst sequel ever. It had absolutely NOTHING to do with Cloverfield. Nothing. I'm no film expert, but I'm pretty sure you're breaking the rules of good filmmaking when you make a sequel that isn't in any way connected to the previous film. That's like making a movie like 007 James Bond, then making a sequel, calling it something like 007 Boulevard, but James Bond isn't in it, nor ANY of the first films characters. I'm sorry, but that is just dumb.Now, I will give credit where credit is due. The movie was very suspenseful and I found myself rooting for the protagonists and hating the antagonist. The acting was decent and the story thought provoking. However, all of that became null and void in the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. You see, I was still under the assumption that I was going to see a connection with Cloverfield.Nope.I realized I had been lied to like the main girl was lied to about the outside air being toxic. You might think I'm being harsh, but I honestly think that if a director thinks they can concoct a decent, suspenseful story as a way of making up for zero connection with the previous movie, they either think their audience cares more about entertainment than common sense, or they just want to make a buck using a thought provoking title. I'm thinking it's a bit of both.I hated this movie. I might be the only one, but hopefully you understand where I'm coming from.Thanks for reading my rant."
" Very well directed, but cheapened by clear corporate interference !!!
",2017-06-21 00:00:00,7,"What I liked:1. The Direction - Based on this film, I have to say Dan Trachtenberg has an inherent sense of crafty visual storytelling that really impressed me. I always find a filmmaker's ability to express feelings and emotions and also proceed the narrative with visuals instead of dialogue, extremely remarkable. I found that flavour of Hitchcock- esque 'pure cinema' in '10 Cloverfield Lane'. The opening to this film is wordless and we don't get to hear a single word out of the protagonist Michelle's mouth till about the 9th or 10th minute mark, but the director manages to say a lot during that sequence with just the camera. Trachtenberg's use of camera movement is fluent and expressive(reminded me of the camera movements in 'Don't Breathe'), his ability to generate and raise the tension in specific scenes is uncanny and he also has the ability to get exceptional performances out of the actors.2. The acting - We get marvellous performances from Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Goodman. Winstead completely pulls off the task of portraying a character who goes through a spiritual and behavioral transformation over the course of the film and Goodman is exceptional as the wild card who remains a mystery throughout the film.3. The script(for the most part) - The film's core concept, though not new or original, is still refreshing due to Trachtenberg's handling of the material. An undeniable claustrophobia, paranoia and dilemma is always lurking around the corner in every scene in '10 Cloverfield Lane'.What I did not like:THE LAST 15 MINUTES - '10 Cloverfield Lane' is a clear example of a film that can be divided into 2 parts - the part made by a filmmaker which is approximately the first 85 minutes and the part made by a studio committee which is approximately the last 15 minutes. In order to make a direct connection with the original 'Cloverfield' film which was merely tangential up to that point, the film takes a turn for the absurd and does exactly what it managed to avoid till then, which is become bloated and ridiculous in an attempt to emulate big budget, effects heavy, commercial studio films that the world gets inundated with. We get this laughably over the top action sequence which betrays the restraint that ornamented the rest of the film. The final sequence genuinely did put me off to some extent and came close to souring some of the goodwill of the film in my mind. The concept of Michelle outgrowing her fears and making a bold decision could have been executed in a much more subtle fashion which would've been appropriate for the film as a whole.Although the finale is disgustingly plastic and hollow, I can't ignore Dan Trachtenberg's brilliant visual storytelling, tension building and crafty handling of the film and I also can't ignore the remarkable performances on show and it is these elements that make the film worth a recommendation."
" I'm now a 'Cloverfield Convert!'
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,7,"A few years ago, 'Cloverfield' was released. If you missed it, it was one of those 'found footage' films where everything is shot by the point of view of one really annoying character who won't put the camera down no matter how much danger comes their way. Sorry, I digress. I really don't like the 'found footage' genre. I find it cheap, annoying and just downright implausible. It was because of this that – despite 'Cloverfield' being a massive hit, I hated it. A giant Godzilla-like alien monster started rampaging through a major U.S. city and the story was about a small band of survivors fleeing the area. One of them had to film the hold experience because I don't know. I just remember getting really frustrated with the film because he wouldn't stop filming even when his leg was being eaten by little monsters. Anyway, it was because of that which meant I wasn't that bothered about seeing this sequel. Only it's not a sequel. Or is it? For a start it's not 'found footage' any more (hooray!) and we meet a girl who gets into a bad car accident on the way home. She's dragged from the wreckage by good ol' John Goodman who takes her home and they live happily ever after. Only joking. He's actually a paranoid nut-job who built a 'perfect' survival bunker just in case the world should happen to end and he wanted to go on living. So, our heroine wakes up there, injured and a little frightened. Especially as Mr Goodman won't let her leave. The closest she gets is the reinforced steel door where she can look out over the stricken world. Only it's not that stricken. It looks quite normal, but Goodman swears that there's enough fallout out there to nuke a cockroach from the inside out. So, she's trapped, with no idea what's happened. Can she get out? Should she, even if she could? Anyway, because most people have either seen, or are aware of, the first movie with the giant monster etc, we assume something bad has indeed happened to the rest of the world. Only this film doesn't really follow on from the original 'Cloverfield.' So, the longer it goes on, you wonder whether you're actually watching a sequel at all, or another film that has sort of piggybacked off its name/fame and has created something different all together. 'Cloverfield' was a big budget monster/horror movie whereas '10 Cloverfield Lane' is small, low budget and confined to the bunker for the whole time.And, in my opinion, it's the superior movie by far. John Goodman is excellent as the paranoid nutter who is probably the last person you want to be stuck on Earth with and you're rooting for our heroine to escape (assuming there's a world left to escape to!). It's more psychological horror than giant-monsters-crushing-New-York-horror and it's all the better for it. I hear that some people weren't too keen on the ending, but, even if you hate it, you should hopefully enjoy the preceding 90% enough to just ignore the very last few scenes. I wouldn't watch Cloverfield again, but I'd definitely watch this in a few years time."
" A surprisingly well developed and tense film.
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,8,"I initially had no interest in seeing this film, I never saw the original Cloverfield film, and I wouldn't want to waste my time on a generic sci-fi film. Therefore, I never saw this film in 2016.A year later and I see this film pop-up in many Top 10 lists, and I decide to give this film a chance after I heard that the film was actually good and didn't follow the story of Cloverfield. I was immediately surprised by the certificate given to the film; I expected the film to be a 15. Therefore, I knew that this film would be tame.However, immediately after watching this film I can safely say that 10 Cloverfield Lane is the most brutal and tense 12 rated film I've ever seen. Although most importantly, 10 Cloverfield Lane is the most well-made and tense film I've seen this year.The films' quality is ensured from the well developed characters and style. The film always places the perspective on Michelle, this is conveyed through the use of tense atmosphere and delivery that perfectly reflects our main characters' emotions.The most important factor that ensured the quality of this film, was the character development and story. Instead of shoving a narrative down your throat through exposition, the film instead decides to play out naturally as you progressively map out the story in your head.The film always catches you off-guard, this is due to the character development, this benefits the audience as they route for the characters, as they're given a reason to care.The film uses sound and visuals to emphasise an impression of a character, however the film constantly flips your expectations. At first the film presents Harold negatively through the viewers expectations, however we soon change our opinion due to his devotion to ensuring safety. As an audience member you're against Michelle, although if you apply the information you've learnt later in the film you'll realise that the expectations you had at the beginning were right all along.There are unfortunately a few problems holding this film back from being an excellent film. Despite the developed nature of the film, unfortunately 10 Cloverfield Lane devolves into the typical sci-fi alien action seen in many films, however what makes this segment forgiving is the realistic and serious tone.I'd also like to point out that this film was surprisingly tense and shocking, especially for a 12 rated film, you see a man being broken down in acid, and a mentally insane woman deteriorating. All of which I expected in a 15 rated film.Another problem is some of the decisions made by the characters, while the characters are human, some of there actions are a bit unjustified. No-one would immediately breathe in the air without precautions, despite this for the most part all seemingly dumb decisions are all answered with a reasonable excuse. One example of this is that Michelle constantly demands reminders for information she already knows this is explained due to the head wound.Other problems are from the standard movie-making clichés. The film has a lot of moments that are unlikely to occur in reality, although the film also has a cliché sequel bate ending. This annoys me deeply as the fact that a studio wants more money is very apparent.Nonetheless, this is now one of my top favourites of 2016, and I'm glad I saw 10 Cloverfield Lane. 8/10"
" What exactly was this movie
",2017-06-14 00:00:00,4,"The story starts fine, continues in a good claustrophobic atmosphere with borderline psychotic characters, almost comes to a pretty good final but then you are upset all over by a ridiculous turn in the story. Why would a director or manuscript writer do that? If you are okay with the final disappointment, you can well enjoy the movie but for me it is not okay. I consider how I feel after I spend two hours of my life to watch a movie and the taste in my mouth is like dirt. It's a pity that so much effort is spoiled by a bad final in a hopeless effort to shock the watchers."
" A great movie but with a normal ending
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,6,"The technique of the story telling, the photography and everything is great. The way it unwrapping the mystery and make audience keep questioning the situation is very nice.But I have to say when the moment the real bad guys shows up, it ruined the genius of this movie. Feel like free fall from one of the top mystery story into a routine apocalypse story ending...Worth watching for sure. I'd gladly give it a 6.5. Just a little shy from getting a 7."
" A thriller, that thriller fans don't want to miss. At All!!
",2017-06-10 00:00:00,8,"I rarely watch a movie without stopping it every 15-20 minutes to do something, and it doesn't mean those movies are bad, it's just that, this is a habit of mine. But this movie kept me staring at my laptop the whole time. I stopped once to get a glass of water. You just can't get your mind off of it until the very end.I don't know what else to add, this is a thriller that thriller fans don't wanna miss. Highly recommended!"
" Time not well spent
",2017-06-09 00:00:00,1,"I wasted my time watching the movie, so I'm not going to add insult to injury by wasting to much time on this review. This movie is pretty much the WORST. The first 95% takes place in a bunker, and the last 5% takes place directly above the bunker in a over the top alien scene. It's all rather silly, and leaves you wondering if this is really how you want to spend your time."
" Review - 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016)
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,7,"For much of the film, the title hardly comes off as significant. The perceiver in you has a lot of questions with regard to why a psychological thriller with claustrophobic traits has been named 10 Cloverfield Lane. What is the relevance? Well, the final act provides all the answers that the viewer (who was expecting a full- blown Cloverfield sequel) has been seeking.The movie starts on a rather tame note. We take on the perspective of Michelle (although not by way of POV like in Cloverfield) who is still undergoing post break-up trauma. Michelle is played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead whose versatility has been proved with the passage of time. Her Ellen Ripley-esque role in The Thing (2011) was nothing short of tremendous. She is a perfectly bankable actor for scenes that involve high levels of tension and unpredictability. This fact is reinstated firmly by her performance in 10 Cloverfield Lane. Winstead is literally pitch-perfect, but we also have John Goodman (Flintstones, Argo, Flight, Hangover 3, The Artist) and John Gallagher Jr. sharing screen-space with her.To describe the plot in a single line would sound something like this: After getting involved in a car accident, Michelle wakes up in a bunker inhabited by Howard (Goodman), who is also its creator, and Emmett (Gallagher Jr.) who pass the news to her that the outside world is unfit for living as the air is contaminated due to an attack by some unknown entity. The viewer, like Michelle, doesn't want to buy this story and we get behind Michelle when she makes frantic attempts to escape the bunker.Twists are carefully revealed one after another and soon we realize that things are not what they seem. Howard becomes increasingly dominant and peevish towards his bunker-mates and once certain facts are concluded, Michelle and Emmett hatch a plan to escape the bunker for good. The outcome is unexpected and thrilling. John Goodman steals the show with his enthralling performance that is almost perfectly in sync with Winstead's. Gallagher Jr. provides the much- needed comic relief during the tensive build-up.One question still remains. How does all this fit into a 'Cloverfield' movie? Answers await in the final act. After a brief scene involving a brilliantly choreographed tussle, the viewer does heave a sigh of relief, only to realize that there are bigger dangers lurking on stand-by. The last quarter hour sure has ample edge-of-the seat moments (although involving extensive use of CG) and leads to a nail-biter of a finale, somewhat reminiscent of the climax sequence in The Thing (2011); only better this time around, thanks to some diligent writing by Josh Campbell, Mathew Stuecken and more significantly Damien Chazelle (of Whiplash fame).Fans of the original Cloverfield have reasons aplenty to be both happy and sad about 10 Cloverfield Lane. This one is not POV, the storyline deals with claustrophobic elements and isolation for most part and it is not directly connected to Drew Goddard/Matt Reeves' Cloverfield. But where it succeeds is in creating implied tension with respect to fear of the unknown. Is the air out there really contaminated? Who was responsible for the attack? What really led them to take refuge in a bunker? Winstead and Goodman prove to be near-perfect casting choices for a film that is brilliantly written by the trio of Campbell, Stuecken and Chazelle, and masterfully directed by Dan Trachtenberg. Music by Bear McCreary, cinematography by Jeff Cutter and editing by Stefan Grube are worthy of mention. The music builds apprehension, camera-work is brisk (but not headache-inducing) especially towards the climax and the edits make sure the run-time does not exceed a decent 1 hour 40 minutes."
" The ending ruined it for me
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,6,"""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a movie that keeps you guessing from the very beginning until almost the end. It tells the story of a woman that wakes up in an unfamiliar room after a car accident and has to decide whether it was a kidnapping or a rescue that brought her into this situation.In my eyes, the producers managed very skillfully to create an atmosphere in which you cannot tell, who to trust and what is the truth. Through several events, viewers get increasingly uncertain in what to think or even get lead on wrong paths. The small cast manages to interact with each other beautifully and thus gives some credibility to the almost bizarre scenario. Unfortunately, this is not how the movie was brought to an end. In my opinion, this could have been a very strong title, but then the aliens hit in. To tell it in advance, I really really really dislike when movies mix up reality and fiction. I don't have anything against neither, but when they intermingle, 99% of the time it doesn't work for me. As here. When I see how the lead character is chased by some alien creature, all of the tension that was built up during the plot just collapses. From that point on I'm more busy rolling my eyes than questioning what happens next. Maybe that's my own weakness but I really can't help the feeling.Now this is a strong movie still, it has some creativity and is much fun during most of its playtime. If you can cope with some fiction, you'll have a lot of fun with it. If not, maybe just stop at 2/3 and imagine an alternative ending."
" John ''The Rock'' Goodman.
",2017-05-22 00:00:00,9,"10 Cloverfield Lane will beat you up, drag down the stairs and then suddenly act like an old friend who will tell you some good jokes and offer a few beers. Just to beat you up to death again 10 minutes later. And with all due respect to Dwayne Johnson, it's John Goodman who should be called The Rock. Damn. It's such a relief to finally see a great thriller, one of the most abused genres probably. And a good sci-fi thriller is even a more rare specimen.The film feels way more powerful and will scare the hell out of you more than any of its big scale rivals, even though it's mostly set in an apartment with just three characters. No cheap tricks or limb amputation. The thrill feels more like a Hitchcockian kind of suspense. You don't know what's happening – just some clues, most of which will be wrong. You have no idea where the story will turn now – the amount of jaw dropping plot turns is incredible. Mary Elisabeth Winstead (still a very underrated actress) deserves the highest appraisal too.An exemplary thriller - smart, tense and well-crafted. The less you know about ""10 Cloverfield Lane"", the better. The script will keep you nervous all the time like a Russian roulette, but it's the performance of the cast that makes ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" much more than a one-trick pony."
" not really what i expected...
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,4,"Reading the short description on IMDb I thought this would be a suspense/psycho thriller. Instead, it comes across as a weird genre mix which ultimately did not really work out for me.Even though all the (three) actors are good, with John Goodman delivering an outstanding performance. Pacing is okay, although sometimes rather slow without really building suspense. What I really disliked the unnatural and forced feeling of the ending, but I guess JJ Abrams does not like to make a movie without aliens..."
" Invigorating twist to the alien invasion genre
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,8,"Loosely tied to Matt Reeves Cloverfield (2008), 10 Cloverfield Lane expands on the surprisingly rich Cloverfield universe while also serving as a fresh twist to the alien invasion genre. The acting is simply superb, especially that of John Goodman. Incredibly intimidating and cold, he truly gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the lumbering, paranoid ex- marine. The confinement of the film's setting and the mystery surrounding our characters adds to the near Hitchcockian levels of tension, as there is literally nowhere to run.The film is also written and directed very well. The film racks the tension as the quick changes in tone works to amplify the viewer's unease. Subtle emotional connection, gut-wrenching tension and the full-on horror aspects all land perfectly, making the film an unpredictable, and quite flavourful, experience. The only issue I had with 10 Cloverfield Lane is the final 15 minutes or so. Without spoiling anything, the film reaches it's explosive climax in a way that closes our main character's arc off nicely, but sadly goes overboard in the process. The quick switch from tense, conservative thrills to full-blown action is quite jarring, and doesn't seem to quite fit in with the tone that the rest of the film sets.Overall, 10 Cloverfield is an engaging, rock-solid gem that is guaranteed to turn knuckles white. While the final stretch oversteps it's tonal boundaries plotted within the first hours of the film, it doesn't ruin them, making this an electrifying and immensely gripping surprise."
" A great combination of mystery and suspense
",2017-05-13 00:00:00,8,"10 Cloverfield Lane is extremely engrossing and entertaining to watch. From the start it gives you a shock and shows you a version of reality that is dark and disturbing but you have no choice but to see it and even believe it. Within the confines of a small house three actors give great and believable performances. The film is great in taking you through a series of phases from panic, to calm, to normal until all hell breaks loose. John Goodman is fantastic as the so called protector and preacher of the evil that exists outside. As the film goes on the mystery and questions increase and you question what is and isn't real. The ending might make a number of viewers laugh in disbelief. This film is one of the best apocalyptic films I have seen to date and it is recommended."
" The ""Blood Relative"" to 2008's CLOVERFIELD is a Surprisingly Effective Thriller
",2017-05-10 00:00:00,8,"In a world of unnecessary sequels to movies that no one asked for, J.J. Abrams and director Dan Trachtenberg snuck in under the radar to show us how to do it right. 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE came out of nowhere and blew everyone away, scoring highly with critics and audiences. I have to imagine the fact that this movie was barely publicized until it was ready to drop really gave it a boost. I seriously doubt anyone was walking around prior to its release saying, ""You know what movie really needs a sequel? That 'found footage' POV monster movie from 2008."" I know I never would've considered it, and I was a fan of that movie. Meanwhile, forces behind the scenes were crafting a new installment that, really, isn't so much a sequel as perhaps instead another tale in some sort of CLOVERFIELD anthology series. Aside from the title (in this case, referring to an actual street in the film) and the usual reference to Slusho you find in any J.J. Abrams project, there is nothing to connect 10 CLOVERFIELD LAND to its predecessor. The fact that Abrams and Paramount didn't come out and announce production on a CLOVERFIELD film meant that there would be no hype machine to start placing potentially unreasonable expectations on the film that might lead to audience disappointment. They were able to create the film they wanted to create without the movie news media breathing down their backs for spoilers and drop it in our laps.The love for 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE is certainly warranted. Just as the first film told a science fiction story from an unusual perspective, this one dips its toe in that same format by placing the audience in the middle of some doomsday apocalyptic scenario from the cozy confines of an underground bunker. Or is it? That is the crux of the majority of the film that focuses on Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), an aspiring fashion designer who's just run out on her fiancé. As she's driving through Louisiana to put some distance between her and her ex, she's involved in a horrible car accident and awakens in the underground survival bunker of Howard (John Goodman). She's rightfully terrified at first of Howard's intentions but he proceeds to explain that there's been an attack on the United States. Some sort of biological weapon had been utilized that's made the surface unlivable and, gee, wasn't it just great luck on her part that Howard found her, brought her to the bunker, and nursed her back to health from her injuries? The only other survivor in the bunker with them is a man named Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.) who had helped Howard build the bunker, and he only knows what Howard's told him about the mysterious events that've led them here. It's a lot for Michelle take in and it's made a little harder to accept due to Howard's increasingly bizarre, menacing behavior. Was there really an attack? Or are these two prisoners?About 80% of this movie plays out in the one location and that could mean disaster for some movies, but 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE makes it work with some top notch production design and cinematography to make the most of the limited space, and with fantastic performances from Winstead and Goodman. Winstead does a fantastic job as the film's hero but Goodman steals the show. His performance here is one of the best he's ever done. Howard is a complex character whose intentions we can only guess at for a while before they become crystal clear, and Goodman plays it so perfectly that, even having watched this movie twice now, I still can't stop being drawn in to his character. He comes across as an awkward, lonely man who is incredibly proud of himself for having been prepared for this scenario and, seeing as how he's saved the lives of these two young folk, expects them to live by his very strict rules. But there's always that nagging doubt that something isn't right with him and, just when you think you've got him pegged as a con artist, the movie reveals some nugget of truth behind what he's told them. It keeps you guessing as to whether something disastrous has really occurred on the surface and Howard is just a bit of a creep, or whether the ""attack"" is all a lie to keep Michelle and Emmett as willing prisoners to a dangerous psychopath in this man's isolated underground concrete prison.All of that is amazing. Everything in the bunker is just great and I would've been fine if the movie ended when that was all resolved, but there's still another twenty minutes or so after that where everything goes a little nuts. For me, the story was all about Michelle and Howard and the science fiction stuff was just added spice to an excellent story. We didn't need a whole section with just the spice. You ever eat a spoonful of turmeric? It's unpleasant. And that heaping spoonful of sci-fi craziness at the end of 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE sours it a bit. But don't let that concern you (assuming you're reading this before having watched it) because it's not enough to ruin the overall fun of this surprise unnecessary (but very welcome) ""sequel""."
" Not sure if happy or just plain blank!
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,7,"Out and out.. 10 CLoverfield Lane is an excellent film when it comes to direction, cinematography and acting. The story has great twists and definitely deserves a one time watch.What may not satisfy you is the climax! Also, think there are some questions left unanswered.. like what exactly was Howard's intentions and the girl he apparently kidnapped amongst other things. The film definitely would have been so much better without the aliens twist. But that liberty is up to the writer and director, isn't it?To summarise, the movie is brilliant up until the last 10 minutes and from there, its up to each individual to decide."
" Terrible movie
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,2,"My rating may seem a little harsh but I did not like this movie at all. The story was slow and full of bad drama and false suspense all leading up to a very rushed and terrible ending. I could have forgiven the movie if it weren't for the surprise (and it was a surprise, albeit an unwanted one) ending of aliens. The story leading up to the ending was not one sufficient to prepare anybody for such an ending, changing the entire movie from suspense to sci-fi in one go. This, some may say, is what makes the film so great but in order to have such a thrilling ending, you need a thrilling beginning and middle. If the bottom bun of a burger is great, that doesn't mean you can skimp on the top bun and the meat. This movie disappointed."
" absolute garbage
",2017-05-08 00:00:00,1,"Anti-human and anti-nature and unacceptable and never recommended to anyone, even to dogs, cats and rats! This product's content is not for a regular human being but a monster. If someone does accept it then this world is really in a big danger. I wonder why did people agree to play roles in this?"
" The Film Is (John) GOOD Man!
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,9,"Yes this is a good movie! I'm not into most of these newer films - most of them are just not ""me"" but this is a pretty darn good movie.I don't wanna give it away to first time viewers but the movie is as it's described: Michelle awakens after a car crash in a locked room, chained to a wall. Howard comes in to let her know he's saved her and she can't leave, aliens or another country have attacked the USA. She find that another person is with the two of them, Emmett. Howard will not let Michelle or Emmett go - it's dangerous, the outside air is contaminated. Michelle is growing more afraid of Howard but is Howard telling the truth? Has WW3 broken out or did Aliens really attack? What is up with Howard? John Goodman is just awesome in this film - his best! Let us not forget how good John Gallagher Jr. and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are in this one. A very intense & claustrophobic atmosphere!9/10"
" The Cloververse is winning.
",2017-05-04 00:00:00,7,"I can not believe I almost forgot to watch this film. I am a huge fan of the first film in the Cloverfield universe and thankfully this one does not disappoint. The film is about a lady taken against her will in the context of what could be an alien invasion or nuclear holocaust. It is a very psychological type of film but be warned, it is the type of movie which hinges on you knowing very little about the movie before watching it. I like Cloverfield better but I enjoy this one as well. And I always respect when a franchise can give you something new, different and hip. Final score, 7.5 out of 10."
" gripping
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,9,"This film certainly plays with your mind.It starts slow as many do but soon you want to know more.John Goodman is fantastic. He plays his role so well. His character is terrifying. The relationship you develop with him over the film is dysfunctional..is he mad? no he's not mad, I trust him, actually he is nuts...etc Two other fantastic performances make this film incredible along with how beautifully shot it is.The scenes outside of the bunker have had mixed reviews. Inside the bunker is in itself a great movie, if they had left it there I think people would generally be equally pleased. But is does not end inside the bunker. SPOILER outside the bunker another great tale begins, an epic tale begins.This film left me feeling uneasy and I still can't understand why.Highly recommended."
" Thrilling Mystery that will Keep you on Edge
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,10,"The first thing I have to say is that the acting in the movie is phenomenal. Mary Elizabeth Winstead, John Gallagher Jr., and John Goodman all did an amazing job in the movie and were perfectly cast. I really love the plot of the film, the setting being an underground shelter and only three people throughout the entire film. It really added to the mood and suspense that is the apocalypse outside. Howard(Goodman) rescues both Michelle (Winstead) and Emmett (Gallagher) and takes them to an underground shelter who both realize after a while that Howard is holding them captive after making unsuccessful attempts to see what is going on outside. The music in this film is also perfectly made adding to the tone. One of the best suspense films in years."
" Ending ruined the whole movie
",2017-04-18 00:00:00,3,"Though this movie started out a little slow, it gained momentum and some interesting suspense. The movie was great with not knowing where it was going to end up. Until it did. Aliens at the end ruined the whole movie. It screamed of desperation - ""how do we end this thing???"" Seriously."
" The Fabled, Dialed-Down Sequel
",2017-04-16 00:00:00,8,"In the months before its release, there was a resurgence of rentals and purchases of 2008's Cloverfield. As with any anticipated sequel, the mentality follows that you will be lost if you aren't fresh on the original. After seeing 10 Cloverfield Lane, I truly wished I had not seen the original first. Note, I say ""first"", not that I regret ever having seen Cloverfield. This is a special sequel, where the less you know, the more effective it is. This is a high praise. We know from the original that there is an alien invasion. There are suggestions of global impact, but the found footage element kept things intimate, perhaps the film's greatest strength. Seeing a bridge demolished by a monstrous claw with 500 helpless civilians screaming can't carry the weight of seeing 5 people we care about in danger. Subject matter like this begs for sequels to raise the stakes; more destruction, wider carnage, higher casualties. Therefore it is unprecedented that 10 Cloverfield Lane shoots for more intimate, with 3 people we can't look away from.I may have painted myself into a corner here. The less you know the better so I will follow the lead of the well edited trailer. At the 15 minute mark of the film, I noted that I had seen everything the preview had unveiled. Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is a 20- something driving down a dark country road. She is alternating her attention from scratchy but ominous radio broadcasts, to a voicemail from a pleading boyfriend. A car approaches from the opposite direct and following a few screeches and flashes of light, Michelle awakens in a concrete cell. Her leg is bound and she has two lines leading to her; an I.V., and an ankle chain. She sees a small mattress, her belongings, and a large steel door. After a moment, a gruff John Goodman opens the chamber and enters. He is cryptic, brash, and solemn. From this moment on, we are making up our mind about his intentions. She leaves her cell, freely, and finds she is part of a bigger prison, a bunker. Another captive, John Gallagher Jr, lounges without any sense of skepticism to their situation. It is explained that the air outside is deadly, for reasons unknown.If the first Cloverfield adds to this film in any way, it is to add weight to the possibility that the bunker is a sanctuary, not a prison. We know what could be waiting outside, and we allow the setting to make its case. There is no diegetic music to suggest anything beyond what we are seeing. The setting holds all the implications we need, ping-ponging between surprisingly homey and claustrophobic. The tension and relief of this mood is hinged on the performance by Goodman, who is equally capable of playing a lovable oaf and a menacing antagonist. You'll have fun making up your mind every step of the way"
" Edge of your seat
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,7,"If you go into 10 Cloverfield Lane expecting a direct sequel to 2008's Cloverfield, you'll be disappointed (and probably a little confused). It's meant to be a sort of ""blood relative"" — it's been implied that the movies exist in the same alternate universe, but they aren't meant to be directly connected in the sense that there are the same characters, the same monsters, etc. 10 Cloverfield Lane was adapted from a spec script titled The Cellar, written by Josh Campbell and Matt Stuecken. From my understanding, the original script of The Cellar was changed a decent amount — in Campbell and Stuecken's version there was no alien attack, and the ending in general had a much different, more helpless feel to it. I have to say just based on that info I like this interpretation quite a bit better.The basic plot has Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) getting into a car accident as she rushes off after an argument with her fiancé. When she wakes up, she's chained in an underground bunker with her captor, Howard (John Goodman), and another prisoner, Emmett (John Gallager Jr.). She is told by both men that there has been some kind of attack and that the air outside is unbreathable, so they must stay in the bunker that Howard has been prepping for years. Michelle starts to gather clues to indicate not only that Howard may be lying, but that they may not have been his first prisoners but when she escapes, the outside world isn't too friendly.This movie is great because it's scary in much more subtle ways. Michelle's car accident is pretty epic, and when she wakes up chained up in this concrete bunker, you immediately start to feel panicked and claustrophobic along with her. John Goodman — who I loved so much as Dan in Roseanne — is kind of scarily good at being this intimidating, powerful force. He's the classic abuser, really. He can switch from being kind and making an effort to connect when it suits him to being short and nasty on a dime — you never know what kind of response you're going to get, and his reactions are often out of proportion with what's going on. He takes any hint of complaint or questioning as a personal attack, and repeatedly demands that Michelle and Emmett be grateful for all he's done for them. He speaks for Michelle on more than one occasion, particularly when he tells Emmett to stop joking around and that she doesn't think it's funny. He lies and covers up those lies effortlessly, always trying to make himself into the good guy, into the under- appreciated one, not least of all when he admits to crashing into Michelle's car on purpose, but insists that he did it to save her. It's terrifying, to say the least, to imagine waking up to such an unstable captor.You initially are convinced that Howard is some kind of psychotic abductor, clearly, with Michelle restrained in an empty room but then you meet Emmett, who is all too happy to be there. When you hear about the apparently inhabitable world outside, you're wary but then, as Michelle tries to escape, a woman covered in skin lesions pounds on the door, desperate to be let inside and saved, before collapsing. The whole movie is very back and forth, giving you evidence of one side but then countering that evidence with a reasonable explanation. It's disorienting to not be sure what is happening or who to be suspicious of.The movie almost starts to take a happy turn at one point — showing the three of them co-existing happily, lounging on the couch reading, having dinner together — but then Howard discovers some of his tools missing and questions them, threatening them with a large barrel of perchloric acid. We, again, are reminded of just how short Howard's temper is and how disproportionately he is capable of reacting as he accepts Emmett's apology and then suddenly, shockingly, shooting him on the spot. I'm pretty sure both my husband and I jumped out of our seats in that moment — both a fantastic sudden scare but also a moment that inspires a lump in your throat as you feel the intense fear that Michelle must be feeling in that moment.The whole escaping process is pretty awesome chaos, with Howard growling at Michelle as he tries to catch her and keep her secluded in his bunker. Again, more with the back and forth as she gets outside and hears birds chirping and for a moment we think that everything worked out, she got loose AND the world is perfectly fine but then we see a huge alien craft in the distance (which is awesomely terrifying). Michelle fights her way out of yet another intense situation and as she leaves she's faced with the option to either go north to wait out the disaster or head to Houston where they are in need of troops to fight and she makes the turn to Houston. I know there were lots of complaints about the ending seeming disjointed and random in comparison with the rest of the movie, but I like the idea of it adding to her character, and adding to her struggle — she may have escaped her captor, her abuser, but that doesn't mean the world outside of that hell is all roses and unicorns. They spent a small chunk of time elaborating on Michelle's inclination to run when things get tough, to disengage and I think the ending was a great way of showing her finding her strength, knowing what kinds of dangers await her in Houston but making that choice anyway to stand up and fight. I thought it was powerful, and, of course, the alien presence exists as a tie-in to the whole Cloverfield universe.Ultimately, a great, on-the-edge-of-your-seat film."
" Highly overrated mess
",2017-03-24 00:00:00,1,"Almost zero suspense and unpleasant characters make this crap fest virtually unwatchable. After all the high praise I was expecting a solid, claustrophobic thriller. Instead we get a poorly paced slog of nothingness. Overrated and underwhelming and one of the stupidest endings involving a Molotov cocktail. Avoid at all costs."
" Worth a visit
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,7,"Plot; A young woman is in a car accident and awakens inside the underground shelter of a man who claims that aboveground is now uninhabitable.Taut, tense thriller for the bulk of its running time, but the last 15 minutes or so feel grafted on to make it match up with the decade old found footage film Cloverfield. The latter I've seen once, with chunks of it on fast forward thanks to an overload of shaky cam and extremely unlikeable characters, such as they are. Cloverfield Lane is a more traditional film, with three co-leads who each give compelling, albeit vastly different, performances. It's ultimately their interaction that makes this worth a watch, somewhat lame finale aside."
" Surprisingly Good
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,8,"Keeps you riveted. Audience is like the leading actress; given information on a need to know basis. So the plot holds your attention.Is Goodman's character a psycho or does he really know something that the rest of us don't? Either way, he does a great job.Unexpected twist at the end which only enhances this production. Definitely a must see."
" There should be a minus rating scale for some films
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,1,"I really can't believe that such films actually come out in the cinemas. I really can't understand what kind of people are rating them with anything more than 1. I really can't accept that people with such a lack of imagination actually make a career as script writers. And I really, really can not tolerate that there's a 76 Metascore and a 7,2 rating. It's the ultimate proof that there's something really stinky in this whole film industry. In any case I will always have in mind the only useful detail that this 'creation' could ever give me:I will save some whiskey bottles in my basement just in case of an alien attack."
" Horror with a Twist - And a Drop
",2017-03-16 00:00:00,7,"A girl in a car accident awakens to find she's in an underground bunker with an oddball farmer and an average Joe with a broken arm. The farmer insists some outside calamity* (nuclear war, aliens?) has occurred, so he's keeping her safe with him. Until when, no one knows.The next part is a taut, claustrophobic thriller as the two ""guests"" try to figure out if Howard is making it all up or is just crazy.** They find some clues about his daughter and the outside world, where a ravaged woman shows up at their door to die.Their plans for an escape go awry, revealing that Howard is indeed crazy. She escapes, killing Howard, to find the air isn't poisoned.As another commenter noted, this would be a good ending point. But then the twist: there was an alien invasion **So it was both! And they come after the girl. Suddenly this rather normal person turns into MacGyver, downing an alien/ship with a homemade Molotov. (Note: Scotch doesn't quite cut it here. And where'd the beast on the ground go?) She then learns about the resistance on the radio and turns to join them.*Major nit: After whatever calamity Howard says may have occurred, wouldn't you want more info? Howard's bunker doesn't have so much as a radio. Okay, maybe he has reasons to keep things secret - even if he's right about aliens (because he is crazy and wants a 'family') with him. But the other two never ask a single question about this. ""What is the radio saying? TV? Cable? Landline? Cell? Internet?"" Maybe some are down, but to never ask about any??"
" Sometimes less is more.
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,9,"First off, I'm rating it 9/10 purely because there should have been a little more 'alien activity' rather than the last 5-10 minutes of movie. Even though it was pure intense suspense from start to near the end, it worked a bloody treat because I was on the edge of my seat wondering what the heck was going on, what was going to happen next.. John Goodman made this film what it was, a terrifying feeling of something awful about to happen around every corner. I constantly thought aliens were going to find a way in to the bunker and wreak havoc, but nope, he comes across as a little bit crazy, especially to the 2 co-stars of this movie.The score was perfect, cast and acting.. I don't think another actor could have had the same, or better impact on the overall feel of the movie. Definitely one to watch!"
" Less is more...
",2017-03-07 00:00:00,7,"10 Cloverfield Lane is an intense, thrilling and claustrophobic experience that holds you on edge for the full runtime...even the end.The movie is brilliantly told with a great use of pure visual storytelling, and an perfect underlining score. The protagonist of this film (fantastic as always Mary Elizabeth Winstead) doesn't even say a word until 10 minutes into the movie, and why should she? What we've seen to this point told us everything we needed to know.But that's also due to the fantastic performances by everyone, most of all John Goodman who portrays one of the most intriguing characters i've seen in a long time, with great expertise, the only downside is that his character doesn't get a proper ending, which get's me to the only negative thing i have to say about this fantastic Thriller......and that's the connection to the movie ""Cloverfield"". In my opinion the movie could have worked much better without it, on it's own, and here is why: The movie wasn't even supposed to be a sequel, but i understand why they made it that way. Dan Trachtenberg seemed to have a nice idea for a great movie and J.J. Abrams wanted to help him push his directorial debut, so he produced it and made it out to be the movie it became. I think that's not a bad idea and i think that everyone should get a great chance like this.The problem is, that the movie now had to have a connection that wasn't there originally and it shows. To make it possible they had to get rid of John Goodmans intriguing character to set up the new threat of the Alien invasion that took place. His character was the only one who knew and believed that such a invasion would take place and so he made his own bunker and saved two people out of compassion, he seems to be a crazy at times, but in the end he was right and just wanted to save what he could, like most people would do.Now this review is already marked with a spoiler-warning, which means people who read it should have seen the movie, so i just tell my version of a more interesting ending for this already great movie:What if we just erase the nowhere-going plot-point of Howard being a kidnapper before, so that he's not just a pure antagonist, now everything goes like in the film, Michelle gets out sees that there are the Alien monsters in the background as well as the gas pumping spaceship, knows that Howard was right all along and just wanted them to be safe, the bunker blows up and with it the last safe place on earth and then it just ends. It's a more interesting and apocalyptic take on the story and i'm pretty sure that's how it would have ended if it doesn't had to build for a Cloverfield-series.BUT all in all i really liked this film and was entertained throughout, how they told the story was near perfection, and i have nothing against how they handled the end, i just think they wasted a bit of potential on their most interesting character..."
" The psychotic comforts of home.
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,8,"I did like the film, even thought it was a bit slow at times. I did have a question though about why someone would be chained up if they were trying to be helped. Goodman plays his role well, and I am sure there is a bit of truth behind the person that he plays. The two men at first seemed to be in cahoots with each other, but it is soon realized that Goodmans character was an extreme alpha male with a bit of a complex. 95% of the film takes place in one location, and I like those kinds of films. The acting was spot on, the effects seemed good, and it leaves a person asking the question....is this a hostage situation, or were the words of Goodmans character the truth?"
" A little disappointing, but worth watching.
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,6,"This movie was a bit slow at times but was okay for a Saturday night at home. John Goodman was of course very good in his role. The story was basically pretty good but overall lacking something. I found it to be less entertaining than I was hoping it would be. I guess the trailer and reviews had me convinced/thinking this would be a great movie. In my opinion it was good, but not great."
" Worst movie i had ever watched
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,1,"I'm a huge horror/thrillers fan Watched this movie with my husband and most of the movie really makes you wonder whats going to happen next. But at the end you just go ""wtf"" and what. A waste of time i'm never getting back Don't watch this movie!! I really don't get the good reviews on here"
" The Power Of Mystery
",2017-02-25 00:00:00,10,"A lot of times (too many times, really), viewers know everything about a film before they even take their seats in the theater. Trailers, promotional material, internet chatter or what you have, the standard film-advertising philosophy now is to show as much as possible to let viewers know exactly what they are getting and can expect. ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" breaks all those rules and is the better for it. Filmed almost entirely in secret at Bad Robot productions, a trailer didn't drop for the film until a scant 4-5 weeks before it premiered. Even that trailer didn't give away a cent of the plot. Because of this secrecy, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is able to do something that other films cannot (or will not): allow the mystery to unfold.For a basic plot summary, this film opens with Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) fleeing her boyfriend due to some sort of relationship trouble. Her car is hit, she blacks out, and the next thing she knows is that she is waking up in some sort of bunker chained to the wall. She quickly discovers that she was pulled from the car wreck by Howard (John Goodman), a survivalist who has built a shelter meant to withstand any apocalyptic event. He tells her that the world is in chaos above ground due to some sort of attack (he cannot give exact details about who or what), and that line of reasoning seems to be confirmed by certain events that transpire and the word of Emmett (John Gallagher Jr.), the other bunker-mate. But is it really as simple as that? Is Howard truly the benefactor he seems to be?This is one of those films that can't be discussed too much more, because it so deeply relies on the mystery that spoilers can be deadly. Suffice it to say, though, that it truly is a gem in pretty much every aspect. The plot is full of twists, the atmosphere is legitimately tension-filled, and the acting is top-notch all around. It has been quite some time since I've been to a film where I've become that sucked into the events transpiring, but again that is because I was a completely blank slate going in. After the first 15-20 minutes of the experience, I had absolutely no clue what would happen next, and that is one of my favorite types of movie-watching experiences. J.J. Abrams' ""Mystery Box"" is alive and well in this one!Of course, one can't review ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" without commenting on its lineage with ""Cloverfield"". It's actually pretty simple: this one isn't a direct sequel (it's not like it picks right up where ""Cloverfield"" left off or anything like that), but it does take place in the same ""universe"", if you will, of that original film. Kind of an anthology sort of thing, where different stories can be told in the context of one over-arching narrative. While completely different in style from ""Cloverfield"", this ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is just as compelling in telling a unique story.Overall, I was thoroughly engaged by ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" from the opening credits to the closing ones. I hope that more films in the future can follow this type of approach and take a more cagey approach to marketing. Sure, this film has great acting, atmosphere, and story, but it really ""works"" because of that sheer power of the mystery. Since you don't know what will happen, the film-making is given free reign to toy with your emotions, making for a powerful cinematic experience."
" First half great / ending very disappointing
",2017-02-19 00:00:00,3,"I wish I could rate the first hour of this movie separate from the last 20 minutes. I was really into this movie wondering if outside really was dangerous, if the other guy was in on it, and many more questions. Great acting and lots of uncertainty and mystery. ---------**spoilers**When she got out of the bunker and the aliens attacked. Really? The entire movie was NOT about aliens - then you had to go and make it bat poop crazy. I like a drama that REALLY COULD HAPPEN. And up until that point all of it could have happened. Here is the alternate ending I wish I could have had: She got out of the bunker, realized there was no danger in the air, ran to the road and got to a police station. They figure out the reality of how crazy this man is and even come up with a few more missing people (maybe even his ex- wife). Then they go to arrest him and he is not there. Enter part 2 or end the movie with him in a new town talking to a young woman or looking to hire someone to help him build a new bunker (with a war story about the new scars on his face from the acid)."
" One of the best underrated movies I've seen in a long time.
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,10,"Can't believe this movie is so little known. It got so much in it. Enigma, fighting, struggling, surviving, friendship, killing, some kind of detective work, a psychopath, victims, accidents and of course a lot of questions about our characters. It has a plot twist that you wouldn't expect or at least you won't be able to predict it accurately. While watching you're not sure about anything. We get the answer but with it the main character has even bigger problems than the one before Everyone have their own struggles and demons. Most of all people should watching for the twist in the end, you keep questioning everything in the movie and the end is of course worth for an A-class movie. You keep wanting to know more but the movie doesn't answer all the questions. I would watch a sequel to it but it won't be as interesting since we know the reason why we see the main character in the bunker."
" Derailed Writing
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,4,"I will not spoil the ending of this movie in this review. I will, however, tell you that the ending will leave you extremely disappointed. 85% of this movie is absolutely brilliant. Its pleasantly unpredictable and if you enjoy psychological suspense, you will enjoy this much of the movie. It was on the road to receive 10 out of 10 stars. The writing and acting were both brilliant on every level. Then... out of nowhere ... and I mean literally out of nowhere, the movie goes to crap. You will know it as soon as you see it as though its a sign from the heavens. The writers decided to not only change the direction of the movie, but the genre of the movie. While some would call this brilliant, most would argue that those people are smoking something and ruined their movie. I spent hours pondering what could have possessed these people to end this movie the way in which they did and the answer has not reached me. All that I can do is write this movie review in hopes that I save people like me in search of good writing in movies in a time period in which its hard to come by. I have also taken the liberty of writing my own ending to appease myself and my significant other in a sort of fan fiction type of way.In conclusion, rating this movie was so difficult because I felt like I was rating two different movies. The majority of the movie gets a solid 10 stars. The ending gets a very flawed 2 stars. As I said, not only was the ending terrible but it was cheesy as well. When I weighed the ratings together, I originally gave this movie a 6 out 10 stars but that's just too high for a movie that ends this poorly."
" Boring and Cliché
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,5,"Movie Rating like this on IMDb makes it really difficult to trust which is a good movie and which is not. Seriously 7.1 rating for such a mediocre silly movie. There is really nothing interesting going on in this movie, 100 other such movie have been created and flopped over the year. A old man, kidnapping a young girl and acting all weird and crazy scary is so cliché. There is no suspense in the movie and its so predictable than one can predict the end after 10 minutes into the movie. I am highly disappointed, with the plot. The ending is so stupid, one can laugh. they saved all of that of the last 15 minutes, and suddenly a creep movie becomes a alien movie."
" A Good Suspense That Falls Flat.
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,6,"If you are wondering what the movie 10 Cloverfield Lane is, well lets say it is a decent suspense film in the same universe as the Cloverfield movie. And I think that was a brilliant idea especially how the movie plays out and makes you wonder what in John Goodman's mind is going on. I was loving it. Gives you that intense creep feel throughout the movie, just waiting to see how this is all going to end. And then the epilogue comes and you feel a stab in your stomach, and realize they just took what could have been an epic ending and turned it into Hollywood's money gimmick. So from here, if you haven't seen the movie and what to know why I think it is a great and awful film continue on. Otherwise don't read on, I will go into much detail on the ending. So again, the beginning, middle, and just up to the end was a fun movie to watch. It makes you guess and wonder what is going to happen. It gives you goosebumps wondering how are they going to tie this movie in with Cloverfield. I think that idea alone makes this movie that much more intense. To have two separate movies that gives you different feels, beautiful! You imagine you know what is going on in the outside world(if you seen Cloverfield), so we go along in this movie inside a safe shelter. John Goodman's character is wonderful to me, winning an award for best villain! You feel for him, then scared, then terrified of this guy. Mary Elizabeth Winstead did a great job and wouldn't have asked for anyone else. While this movie mainly takes place in a shelter, it does a great job on just the story, character growth, and the suspense waiting for the climatic moment. The music was on par. I think they did a very great job on it. I was actually loving the buildup/intense sounds, amazing job there! Then finally, the moment is here. I'm going through my head what is to come when we see the outside world. And bam! Hollywood takes over, they did their thing and just ruined everything about this movie to me. I can't say this is all Hollywood's fault, it could've be who wrote it, J.J. Abrams for all I know. The reason I'm saying Hollywood and a money gimmick is the fact you had a movie that wasn't anything like Cloverfield, but in the same universe waiting to see how it ties in. To just get alien ships flying in, killing humans on sight. Random cheesy fight scene. A lady who was terrified of John Goodman's character to somehow take on an alien ship with a molotov cocktail and win? Survives, and goes to fight in a town where they are being attacked by aliens trying to wipe us out. All that enraged me. How did Cloverfield, which centered around a giant alien, yes I know it fell from space I guess, that spawned creepy little aliens to this movie having alien ships, giant alien ships trying to take us over. How many alien movies can I name that have that plot? War of the Worlds, Independence Day, Skyline(ugh), Mars Attack!, Signs, Battle Los Angeles. Off the top of my head. What I'm trying to say is, why go that route? Why couldn't we have got a better ending, something that tied it into Cloverfield? All those movies I listed could have been in the same universe. Why call this one a Cloverfield? Why not 10 Independence Day Lane? A dark ending that fits in with the dark element of the movie, not an action hero ending. Have her come out of the shelter and see the monster from Cloverfield fighting Godzilla would have been way better. But from what I hear, the script is/was meant for another film after this. Money gimmick is how I see it. They could have ended this movie which showed us actual more of the monster or story. But we get alien ships. Only reason I gave it a 6/10 was because the rest of the movie held up. Not the ending, if that is your type of movie I say go for it. Otherwise, pass!!"
" Things get a bit mental towards the end, but other than that it's great
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,7,"A young woman Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead)becomes involved in a car accident and wakes up to find herself in an underground nuclear bunker. Michelle, along with another man called Emmett (John Gallagher Jr) is being held in this bunker by Howard (John Goodman). Howard informs Michelle that there has been some kind of chemical/nuclear attack and that everyone else has been killed by this attack. Michelle is unnerved by Howard, but he assures her that he has rescued her and that he intends to look after her. Emmett witnessed Howard building the bunker and breaks into his bunker when he learns of the apocalypse. However, Michelle and Emmett both sense there is something not quite right about Howard and using Michelle's creative prowess they plot their escape.For the most part, 10 Cloverfield Lane is so well-crafted and well-put together that's it's hard to believe that it was directed by someone who, at the time of writing this review, has only got 3 short films to his name. Trachtenberg mounts the tension admirably and in the early stages this film reminded me a little bit of Oldboy; Michelle has seemingly being abducted for unknown reasons, her captor explains why she's been held, but she doesn't know whether or not to believe in what she is being told by her captor. Howard's Jekyll and Hyde nature means that you're never quite sure what he is going to do from one minute to the next. There are moments in the film where everyone seems to be getting along, then other moments where Howard flairs up for no apparent reason and other occasions where he appears to be relatively calm in the aftermath of being attacked by Michelle. As a character, he is interesting and is someone you don't want to take your eyes away from when he's on screen. Trachtenberg also uses the enclosed environment to good effect with lots of close ups and close shots which creates a tense and claustrophobic atmosphere.The performances help matters here with the likes of John Goodman & Mary Elizabeth Winstead being on particularly good form. The former is someone who is better known for playing loud, brash or comedy characters, but here he is much more low-key and subtle than normal - this is intended as a compliment as he was downright terrifying at times. Winstead is equally effective in her respective role; clever, ballsy, resourceful and ever so slightly vulnerable she's actually the sort of person who it is easy to form a rooting interest in. Gallagher Jr is OK, but never really makes the same impression on the picture as Goodman or Winstead.The final 25 minutes are just a mixture of mad and crazy; the chase round the bunker between Michelle and Howard was exciting, albeit a tad predictable and all the alien stuff at the end was just crazy beyond words. I believe that this film is somehow linked to the original Cloverfield from 2008 so perhaps I shouldn't have been entirely surprised by what happened at the end, but given the way things were unfolding I expected the ending to be slightly more tense and powerful and I have to admit that the ending was slightly disappointing. Despite this though, the film does mostly work and although I found the ending slightly disappointing I have to admit that it still has plenty of good qualities."
" The movie with the bizarre story
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,8,"in the beginning of the movie until the almost final scenes , you will watch a wittily-done mysterious movie plot because of of the surprisingly constant unexpected events , but the ending scene is something else , that's why i classify this movie to be a surreal one ,i like how 'Mary Elizabeth Winstead' done her role astonishingly good , and not to forget 'John Goodman' either , but what worth mentioning here is the last scene intervention , i swear it will draw your attention and make you wonder and reconsider the movie's main purpose , and in my opinion if it wasn't for the guy who put the soundtrack the movie would be turned to comedy . overall ,the movie worth your time and if you're into unexpected , suspenseful movie , and like to get real flabbergasted! then i recommend you to watch this movie . Thank you All.."
" I don't get it
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,1,"^this warning is just because my review has indeed spoilers, but that's OK. Don't watch this crap. Just read my review and move on.I'm also writing this, because I want someone to explain to me why this pathetic excuse for a movie collects so many nominations and receives so many great reviews. I mean, more than 7/10 for the most boring, overrated movie? It all starts as some dumb girl has a car accident. She wakes up in a cellar in a bunker and she's told by a fattie that the world has ended. Then we get 90 minutes of some boring scenes. The only thing I could think was that it was stupid to drink so much coffee before seeing this crap, because I could not fall asleep. In the end, she finally escapes the bunker, and this is the part where you're allowed to laugh out loud: she destroys an alien spaceship with a bottle from the liquor store and we see her going to help others. Bam. End of the movie."
" Nowhere near as bad as I feared
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,6,"This movie has ""Coverfield"" in the name, and shares at least a director with that earlier movie. In fact, I bought it on blu-ray in a double pack. So, having seen the earlier movie, which was a very humdrum affair in all respects except the visual arts, I wasn't expecting much.In fact, I was pleasantly surprised. 10CL centres on the tense relationships between three people confined -- willingly or not -- in a survival bunker. Some unspecified ""attack"" has taken place, and it seems that the outside world is uninhabitable. It looks OK, however, through the airlock window, so the real situation is unclear. As the movie progresses, it becomes increasingly clear that the owner of the bunker is somewhat unstable, and may even be a murderer. The three folks in the bunker are the only actors with more than a couple of lines, and all the performances are excellent.But (spoiler coming...) Having seen Cloverfield, I always assumed that space monsters or some-such would be involved somewhere. I mean, why would the filmmakers choose this name except to make that exact connection? This rather killed the suspense for me. Had the link been unclear -- had it been uncertain right up until the last moment whether the surface was safe or not -- it would have been a better movie. Sure, ""Howard"" -- the bunker's owner -- is a fruitcake, and he may have a sinister motive for keeping a young woman trapped. But that in no way precludes a genuine disaster having taken place as well.There is an FAQ entry attached to this IMDb entry that says, essentially, that the film-makers did not intend any particular relationship between 10CL and Cloverfield. It's true that we don't see the same monsters, and there are continuity problems if the events in 10CL are intended to follow directly after those in Cloverfield. But I assumed right from the start that when Howard suggested the world had been invaded by ""Martians"", he was referring to the events in Cloverfield. So when the monsters eventually appeared, I was not surprised. I'm only surprised that other reviewers found the ending genuinely unexpected -- I can only imagine that they never saw Cloverfield, or had forgotten its plot.In short, this is a potentially excellent movie, slightly let down by the plot give-away inherent in its title and authorship."
" Living conditions
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,8,"Obviously the road name itself may remind you of a certain movie from the year 2008. A movie that was shot as ""found footage"", unlike this one right here. Although the space is confined and this could've gone the same route too, which it doesn't. John Goodman plays host here and what a host he is ... Which is more of a question than a statement to be truthful, but I'll let it stay.There are actually a lot of questions in this one. One of them being if there actually are Aliens as proposed by Goodmans character or if he's just crazy. The road name adds to the mystery and there are a lot of strange things that may interpreted in one way or another. Actually because this is plays in a closed place, the tension is high and you don't really know if there is an escape or a look to the outside ... will there be? Do you want to watch this and does it sound intriguing? Then go ahead"
" Well Put Together
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,7,"This movie was intelligently done and it had to be considering the setting. Just about the entirety of this movie takes place in a multi-room, underground bunker of about 400-500 square feet (rough guesstimate). When a film is limited in its setting to that degree it has a smaller margin of error for being watchable.I had my doubts about this movie going in because of the word ""cloverfield"". My memories of the other movie titled simply ""Cloverfield"" were not good. Shaky-cam POV comes to mind and that is not my cup of tea.10 Cloverfield Lane is shot more traditionally and they employed the services of a known actor in John Goodman. The movie is filmed completely from the perspective of Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), the main character. After leaving a gas station she gets involved in an accident just to wake up chained to a wall in a bunker. The bunker belongs to her captor, Howard (John Goodman), and he is trying to convince her that he has her there for her own good. Is he telling the truth or is he not? There are indicators that he is but then there are indicators that he is a nut case as well.It is an intense movie. Michelle is caught in a quandary and her goal of getting answers and/or freedom require a lot of daring behavior. John Goodman does a stellar job as an enigmatic captor/savior. He is hard to read throughout the movie which makes him and the situation all the more confusing and scary. The movie was just really well put together."

",2017-01-19 00:00:00,8,"10 Cloverfield Lane is directed by Dan Trachtenberg and collectively written by Josh Campbell, Matthew Stuecken and Damien Chazelle. It stars John Goodman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and John Gallagher Jr. Music is by Bear McCreary and cinematography by Jeff Cutter.Michelle (Winstead) awakes from a car crash to find she is in a locked underground shelter...From the off it has to be said that to know nothing about this film prior to viewing it will be an absolute bonus. For the rewards are plenty. Trachtenberg and his team have crafted a film that is tense from the get go, a piece that consistently has you wondering just what the hell is going on, not only are we puzzled by the three character dynamic in the shelter, particularly as regards Howard (Goodman), the proprietor of this particular shelter, but also just what has happened in the outside world? If anything? This only helps further the claustrophobic feel that's already brought about by the location setting of the tale.A key strength of it, is that it, via Michelle's mindset, coerces us viewers into feeling her unease, and yet conversely we rejoice at her resourcefulness. On the same side of the coin comes her relationship with the third party in the shelter, Emmett (Gallagher Jr), it grows honestly and offers hope in what looks to be a bleak situation. But of course as tale unfolds, things start to come together, edgily so, with little spurts of action, shocks and genuine dread, all building up to the big finale, the reveals. Which will either have you spitting feathers or cursing the makers for the routes taken...Superbly acted by the three principals (it's great that some film makers still realise Goodman is a major talent), and technically impressive for sound and vision, this coiled spring thriller is a winner. 8.5/10"
" A Good Suspense-Thriller Weakened By An Unnecessary Sci-Fi Turn At The End
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,6,"For the most part, ""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a very good thriller, very suspenseful and certainly manages to keep the viewers on the edge of their seat. From the start you're not entirely sure what's happening, and the scenes in the bunker are almost surreal in the way they move from menacing to sheer domestic. The atmosphere in the bunker was superb, and fit the genre of the movie perfectly, and director Dan Trachtenberg used it well. The highlight of the movie for me was John Goodman. I confess that I'm not really a big fan of Goodman, but I'd be prepared to say that this may have been the best performance I've seen him give. As Howard, he can be both scary and charming, and there's mystery about him. From the very start you don't really know if he's a good guy or a bad guy; if he's telling the truth or lying through his teeth. The movie begins with a car accident. Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is leaving her boyfriend and gets into a bad accident. When she awakens she's chained to the wall in a room, apparently a prisoner of Howard. But is she a prisoner? Howard tells her that there's been some type of attack (nuclear or chemical) and that he found her and brought her into the bunker to save her life, because the air outside is unbreathable. Is that true? We wonder for a while, but there seems to be enough supporting his story to make us believe him. There's a second prisoner or guest - Emmett (John Gallagher, Jr.) about whom we learn very little. How did he get there? We're not sure. Howard, Emmett and Michelle seem to settle in for the long haul, convinced that they can't get out. Howard is a bit unbalanced, and you get the impression that you can never really be sure how he's going to react to things. He clearly was a prepper - believing that something like this was going to happen, and maybe a little bit shocked that it actually did. Emmett and Michelle wonder about escaping - but escaping to where? Is there anything left outside the bunker? Could they survive if they left?It's very suspenseful, and then as far as I was concerned it was ruined by the ending, which turned into some sort of alien/sci-fi sort of film. I knew that as always a possibility, but I was hoping that the movie would take a different direction. It was working quite well for me just as the mystery of Howard and the bunker, which the confined atmosphere creating more than enough suspense. I didn't really need aliens. Somehow, for me, that took away from what had been making the movie work so well.Supposedly this is described as a ""spiritual successor"" to the 2008 film ""Cloverfield."" Maybe - but you don't need to have seen ""Cloverfield"" for this to make sense. I wouldn't call it a sequel in the normal use of the term and I can't really say that anything in this really made me think about ""Cloverfield."" It's capable of standing on its own. It's a taut little suspense/thriller with an ending that could have been better."
" Okay, but could have been so much better
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,6,"A woman, Michelle, is involved in a late-night car crash and knocked unconscious. When she comes to, she is a prisoner in a cell. She is in a concrete bunker deep under the farm house of Howard, who claims he saved her from the crash. Moreover, he claims that her being down here is for her own good, as the US has been attacked, using nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, and the air on the surface is not fit to breath. Michelle is deeply suspicious and thinks this is just a ruse to keep her imprisoned. She looks for ways to escape. She also discovers that there is a third person in the bunker, Emmett. The movie had heaps of potential. Very intriguing initially - the whole crazed kidnapper vs hiding from WW3/aliens puzzle. Even when the movie went more down one of these paths I was still thinking that this was a bluff and that it really was the other.However, was it sets off on the chosen path, there is little in the way of twists. Pretty much a linear story with a not-too-shocking revelation towards the end and some standard action scenes.Just felt very conventional, ultimately, when it could have been something very special."
" Unbelievably stupid !!
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,4,"Its a bit rare that you come across a movie which is so highly acclaimed and you find it totally trash. So, I decided to write a review on the things which bothered me. I found the whole movie completely unbelievable. The characters are not convincing in there actions and things are left unexplained. The only saving grace is the acting and the humorous part of the movie which made the characters adorable, hence the 4 stars. But this was not expected from a thriller. Actually even some serious parts of the movie sounded funny to me !The characters played by Mary Winstead and John Gallegher plotting against the John Goodman seems unreasonable and quite frankly unverified throughout the whole movie. Is Goodman a sexual predator or simply nuts ? The viewer will never found out. -John Gallegner's character is so easily convinced by some cock and bull story by Mary without doing any additional verification even though he knows Goodman far better than the new girl .The aliens killed by a bottle of scotch took the crown . This looks like a completely unbelievable aspect of the story where the aliens are shown as so stupid to fall for a fragile attempt to screw their sophisticated attack.The girl ""escaping"" without any remorse or realization that Goodman was only trying to protect her . She is not only responsible for destroying their sophisticated hideout but also has a hand in getting both the guys killed with her stupid and cruel actions. The final shot scene where she is shown heading to Houston was another funny scene. What does she think ? That she is a super hero who will be able to save the rest of humanity. I am just amazed by how this movie has managed such a hype. I am totally disappointed ."
" Interesting but padded
",2017-01-13 00:00:00,7,"""10 Cloverfield Lane"" is a superior example of the kind of story that would have made it into a half an hour on a show like ""The Twilight Zone"" or ""The Outer Limits"". For some reason most horror/sci-fi movies these days have that feeling, like what you're seeing would have been far more effective at a shorter run time, and the idea doesn't really sustain a feature length.I guess kids today, who didn't grow up with shows like that, may not have the same impression.The story is interesting enough, and is largely held together by the unsettling performance of John Goodman. The ending is also a show stopper, though the movie has some padding on the way there that may make your interest wane."
" Hidden agenda
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,5,"Cloverfield was a found footage movie of a monster loose in New York city.10 Cloverfield Lane is a sideways sequel. The ending ties up with the events of Cloverfield in a sense that this is the same universe and what is happening elsewhere in the USA might have an impact in the character's motives.However this film has more in common with Room or Misery or The disappearance of Alice Creed.Howard (John Goodman) lives in a bunker and also inside is young handyman Emmet (John Gallagher Jr) and Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) a young woman who we see hurriedly packing up some things and then driving off in her car that collided with a vehicle driven by Howard.Michelle wakes up on a mattress and chained to a wall. She is confused and frightened. Howard tells her that he saved her life and everyone in the outside world is dead after some kind of attack and the air outside is toxic.However can Howard be trusted? He has arbitrary rules, he appears volatile, he lacks empathy about Michelle's predicament and sometimes acts more like an abuser.The film is really a claustrophobic thriller as Michelle and Emmett detect inconsistencies in Howard's story and look to escape, but what sort of world is out there?An interesting variation of a franchise where they could had just plodded along the found footage alien invasion plot but it will leave sci fi fans unsatisfied, it is not a horror film in the vein of Hostel or Saw and we saw something similar in Room."
" A film full of suspense and surprises.
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,9,"A woman finds herself in a bunker after a car crash but how did she get there and why is she there?. 10 Cloverfield Lane is a fairly slow moving film pretty much set in one place. It relies heavily on keeping the audience guessing as to what is really happening. On this score it works pretty well with plenty of red herrings thrown in along the way as the paranoia of the situation kicks in. The fact that there are spells when not much happens makes the things that do happen more sinister.John Goodman is fantastic as the owner of the bunker whilst Mary Elizabeth Winstead is captivating as the woman trying to piece together what is real and what isn't. John Gallagher Jr has a lesser job as the every man but still convinces. This is a film that pays to stick with as it ratchets up the tension tenfold as it nears it's climax. There is a sudden switch of pace towards the end which is a brave thing of the film makers to try. I found the ending a bit of a disappointment but I still found this an interesting mix of genres and always entertaining. I was so confused as to whether I liked this film much on first watch, that I re-watched it the following day, something I rarely do. This confirmed to me that it is a good film despite a few things I didn't like. Personally I'd rate it slightly higher than Cloverfield as it's just a more interesting film."
" Tense and claustrophobic thriller
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,No spoilers in this review as this is really a film you should see without knowing much about. All you need to know is that its a tense and claustrophobic thriller featuring powerful performances that will grip you until the end. We are put in with three characters and watch as they deal with the situation they've been put in however it really feels like you're with them. All three are well developed and acted and help elevate this already great film. If you didn't like Cloverfield then you can still enjoy this film as the two are very different beasts and this one at least is less gimmicky and probably more accessible. Overall I'd recommend it to anyone that loves slow burn suspense and wants something a little bit different to other films out there.
" How many doubts do I see watching this movie?
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,5,"I think we're talking about a movie that's not being a bad movie, it's not a good movie. For reasons that I comment in the spoiler area, I can not say that it is good even having great things. It has a good script, the actors are great, it keeps you outstanding. You are intrigued for a long time of the movie.I think he has a technically good photo. I do not say the same thing about the camera. But at least it is well carried, has intrigue and manages to keep the viewer thinking that it is true and not.The actors, all five are great. I've never seen that record of John and it's very good.For all this I put a five, could have been much better.Spoiler:Spoiler: There comes a time when you think the woman trying to get in, agrees with John Goodman. But I have also thought for a long time that why they do not ask how he will know that everything has already happened. Nobody wonders why such an obsessive person is not on the radio all the time looking for survivors? The effects are fine until the end. It is the drop I was missing next to the previous doubts. Bugs? They always look bad and this time it was not going to be less, it does not stick to the story. You are surprised when you see the ship, I did not expect it, I thought it was kidnapped, but the bugs have disappointed me. The truth is that when she takes the car is when it seems that something is going to start and ends the movie. Will there be a second part?"
" Nice story-line and performances but a disappointing ending
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,5,"First of all, I should start this review by stating that I was very excited to see this film. I rarely go to the cinema and this was one of the films I had picked out to see at the cinema which means I liked it very much. Secondly, the performances were brilliant which was an important aspect of this film since it featured only a few actors which were also the protagonists. Its claustrophobic theme was breathtaking: you were feeling for the 3 people and could sympathize with all 3 of them, even though you didn't know if they were actually nice or disturbed. The film was indeed a roller-coaster ride. You were led to believe that the ''abductor'' was a kind guy who just wanted to help, then you find out that he has probably abducted other women and killed them so he must be crazy and then, the twist at the end informs you that you should have believed him and that he didn't want to hurt you (as much) after all.But, I rated this film with 4 out of 10 stars because the ending, although I did not expect it, involved aliens which made the film sci-fi, which was not the reason I wanted to watch it. On the contrary, I was expecting another genre and I didn't like that kind of transformation. Plus, the aliens that seemed to be very powerful at first, eventually retreat when the female protagonist -in the heat of the moment, tired, shocked and scared- attacks them with what? A bottle? In conclusion, the ending came of as sketchy and sloppy, as if they had wasted the film's minutes building up the suspense and then they ran out of time, so they just surprised us with some aliens and a very cheap solution so that the female protagonist can survive."
