" Unmemorable melodrama.
",2021-03-05 00:00:00,5,"This film was so bland. It's a life drama, yet very uninspired. It had some moments I liked, but as whole it's truly lacking experience. It feels as if they had some good ideas for a few scenes and then made a whole movie around them."
" Simple narration.
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,7,"The Brazilian director Anna Muylaert hits the right tone, between drama and comedy, with which she tells the story; achieving a great balance in which it does not fall into melodrama at any time, nor does it remain superfluous. Also highlighting in her work, the very successful choice of frames, which ""trap"" the characters on the stage, showing which is the place that corresponds to each one, from which they should not leave. The plot unfolds with a good rhythm, showing us in a completely credible way the evolution of its characters; where the work of the entire cast also influences. In this regard, we must highlight the great performance of Regina Casé, giving life to the servile and submissive maid, who manages to give the character a great humanism.
A film that succeeds in raising and executing its social criticism that can become harsh."
" Clishe
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,4,"Of course .Everyone knows that if you are rich, you are idiot, miserable ,fat and you smoke joint all day along.But if you are poor you are genius ,and kind .It is something like Mexican tv series cliche.However, it has good shots, and actors are very good.I could be a lot better with fewer cliche ."
" The First Mother
",2020-06-21 00:00:00,9,"An interesting exploration of Class Conflict and Generation Gap in Brazil, i can easly add this film to the Top 3 Brazilians films i've ever seen along side ""City of God"" and ""Central Station""."
" shallow cliche of Brazilian culture
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,1,Superficial clichè of brazilian culture. where rich people are bad and poor people are good. it proves the shallowness of Brazilian cinemahowever the pool scene at the end is quite poetic
" Class-conditioned
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,8,"The name of the film 'The Second Mother' carries two meanings: when a young woman comes to live with her mother, having been brought up by a relative, she is getting a second parent; that parent, meanwhile, has acted as a second mother to a child in a household where she's worked for many years as a maid. Her long-term relationship with her employers is such that she is treated both as part of the family but also as a servant, a member of a wholly inferior class; in her own mind, she sees only the former, and avoids thinking about how she is ""one of them"" only when it is convenient for them, not for her. Her daughter, of course, doesn't see the world through such a prism, causing sparks to fly; but the latter's self-righteousness turns out to hide her own secrets. The film is nicely observed, and not over-acted, and mostly follows the axiom of ""show don't tell"". The ending, however, seems a bit glib: if it was possible to work everything out this way, why has it not happened before?"
" A unique and interesting exploration of class in Brazil.
",2017-12-11 00:00:00,9,"Val is a housekeeper for a wealthy family in São Paulo Brazil. Despite being like ""part of the family"" and raising the family's son, Fabinho, as if he were her own son, Val has been separated from her own family for many years as she works to make money to support her daughter. When that daughter, Jessica, needs a place to stay while she studies for her entrance exam for a prestigious college in São Paulo, Val is all too eager to be reunited with the child she had to leave behind so many years ago. Val has been a live-in housekeeper/nanny for the family for years, and the issues begin when Jessica quickly shows that she has no respect for the unspoken rules that govern class within the household. The title of the film roughly translates to ""When will she return?"" and the theme of mothers separated from their children reappears throughout the film. Val and Jessica are not close because Jessica was raised by family while Val made money to support her. Fabinho and Dona Barbara are similarly estranged by her career. This film explores the dynamic and class boundaries within the household. Although Val considers herself part of the family, Jessica's disruptive presence quickly reveals that this is not quite the case. Val is also physically separated from the family, dwelling within her own domain in the kitchen and constantly eavesdropping on the conversations that take place in the dining room just through the open doorway. Que Horas Ela Volta? is hilarious, well-acted, and at times a little uncomfortable to watch. Val and Jessica may not disassemble class structure in Brazil, but the ridiculous and sometimes demeaning treatment that Val receives from Dona Barbara does cause the viewer to reject that treatment, which is a start."
" ""A class struggle""
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,7,"It is a story centered on the life of Val, a maid who lives serving a high-class family 24 hours a day, where Don Carlos is a billionaire and his wife Barbara is a design professional, there is also his son Fabricio, a very spoiled child. Val has a daughter and takes her to live with her. When Jessica arrives at that house, everything changes. Jessica belongs to another generation and does not accept that her mother is treated badly. She demands that Val does not resign herself to living like this all her life serving and that she seeks other aspirations. It shows Val's lack of his own dignity due to his education and social beliefs. It also shows the tragedy of some mothers who dedicate themselves to work more and do not dedicate themselves to the upbringing of their children, which causes the lack of love of their children to their mothers. This film clearly shows the social divisions that still exist in these times. But also in this new generation, this problem can be broken with the independence of equal rights as shown when going to university equally. A second mother is a film that shows the social classes and opportunities in Brazil today. It also brings us closer to two different generations of mother and daughter and the struggle for aspirations of equality, tolerance, and respect. Which I think carries a positive and optimistic message for the new generations."
" Classism in Muylaert's Que Horas Ela Vota?
",2017-12-04 00:00:00,9,"Que Horas Ela Volta? (2015), directed by Anna Muylaert, tells the story of Val—a live-in nanny/maid who serves and tends to a wealthy couple and their teenage son in São Paolo. Val has evidently worked for this family for quite a while and is often seemingly accepted as a member of this family. It is evidenced at various points throughout the story that Val essentially functions as a second mother to the boy, giving rise to the English title of this film, The Second Mother.Not long into the film, it is unveiled that in order to work for this family, Val has left behind a family of her own, including her estranged daughter, Jéssica, with whom she has not spoken in a long time. Out of the blue, Val receives a call from Jéssica, who informs her mother that she will be visiting São Paolo in order to take a university placement exam. Val makes arrangements for her daughter to stay with her while she is in town and, though initially excited to meet Val's daughter, Val's employers become discontent when Jéssica refuses to accept her role as a ""second-tier"" individual. Contrary to their expectations, she openly eats at their table and does not stay confined to her mother's quarters. Instead, she sits at the main table and accepts meals and beverages from her mother's employer, Carlos. Carlos takes a romantic (and creepy) interest in Jéssica, allowing her to stay in the guest room instead of with Val. Without permission, Jéssica uses the pool, a privilege only the wealthy are supposed to have.The breaking point of the film presents itself when Fabinho (the employers' son), who is the same age as Jéssica, does not get into the university, but Jéssica does. Bárbara (the patroness) refuses to accept Jéssica's rise—her disregard for the class system—and effectively kicks Jéssica out of her home. Though initially angry at Jéssica's reluctance to accept her social role, her mother Val eventually seems to come around to her disregard for classism, apparent toward the end of the film, when she joyously dances in her employers' half-empty pool. On top of a great cast, this film is extremely well put-together and excels in its presentation and critique of this important social issue. As someone who grew up with immigrant, working-class parents, it is easy for me to relate to the struggles Jéssica faces as she grapples for acceptance."
" Fantastic Movie!
",2017-12-01 00:00:00,9,"The Second Mother is a wonderful film that really emphasizes many topics that we really do not get to cover in other films. Even if we do cover them directly, the audience would feel attacked and would not want to see the film. This film covers these various topics in an indirect way, by making the audience empathize with the protagonist, Val. Through the use of emphasizing the audience would not have to feel attacked and can learn about the wrongs in the film in their own way. The film covers topics such as social class, race, and gender. We see Val in the movie as a nanny, taking care of a child who is rich and comes from a mostly white family. Val, is a woman of color that is also one of the main servants in the family's home. She is shown as ""knowing her place"", because of her knowing that she poor and is supposed to be in the shadows when serving the family. If one researches the history of Brazil we learn more about slavery in Brazil and the abuse that the slaves went through. One of the many roles the slaves had to got through was to be a servant in the master's house, so we see that in Val's case. There is also the topic of gender and the woman's role in which we see with the patriarch of the family towards the daughter and in Val's case. Val's case was supposed to take care of her daughter, but instead she took care of the family's son and her daughter comes by and reiterates to her what her original role was. There are many more topics that the film covers, such as intergenerational mobility and more. I describe the movie as a serious film, and it is not. It is an enjoyable film with many scenes that made me laugh. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who wants to wants to know more about Brazil and to pass time. I promise you, it is not boring."
" A Harsh Reality
",2017-11-30 00:00:00,6,"This movies tells the interesting story of a nanny, Val, and her daughter, Jessica. The two have not seen each other in about ten years, and out of the blue, Jessica calls and is on her way to Sao Paolo to begin applying for university. The rest of the movie is a portrayal of Jessica and Val's rocky relationship over the socioeconomic classes that dictate Val's oppressed behavior. The most confusing part of the story for me is Jessica's aggressive reaction to her mother's position within the family that she is serving. The movie does not go into much details as to where Jessica was raised, but it is hinted that she came from the northeast. Her attitude is almost entitled as if she too is coming from the highest of the socioeconomic class of Brazil. While I disagree with the manner in which Val is treated by the family, there are certain social graces that most people understand regardless of socioeconomic class. Jessica's aggressive behavior causes a lot of tension between her and her mother, and I still do not understand where this is coming from. WE do not know if she is coming from a higher socioeconomic class than her mother. My theory is that she maybe is harboring a little bit of jealousy. Val has more or less been the mother figure to the son of the family, Fabrinho. While Jessica at a young age, had her mother stolen from her, Fabrinho had two. Sort of. Val seems to be kinder and more caring towards this young boy that is not even her own child. As a daughter, that must be hard to watch, and that is why I believe that Jessica is a little aggressive in her behavior at the family's home. The children of the domestic workers are almost getting the short end of the stick. She had to grow up without really knowing her mother, at the same time that her mother was taking care of a child that is not her own."
" Changing the stereotype
",2017-11-28 00:00:00,9,"The Second Mother (2015) directed by Anna Muylaert is a fascinating film. I really love that the director focuses on positive aspects of topics that are not normally spoken about positively.This film focuses on the life of the protagonist Val. Val moves to Sao Paulo leaving her daughter behind to provide a better life for her. In Sao Paulo, Val works as a maid for a wealthy family. She lives with this family and takes care of the only child of the family, Fabinho. When Val's daughter, Jessica, is almost eighteen years old, she calls Val asking if she can live with her while she studies to take the admission exam at the University of Sao Paulo. Val asks the family she lives with for permission to let Jessica live with them while they look for an apartment for both of them. The lady of the house, Dona Barbara, gives Val permission. When Jessica arrives at the house of the wealthy family, she is surprised that she expects her to sleep in the tight room where Val stays. Dona Barbara's husband, Don Carlos, is attracted to Jessica. He lets her do what she wants and treats her like a person of the family. Val scolds Jessica a lot and tells her that she should not have social interactions with the family because they are poor.I love Jessica's character and the positive use that the director gave to that character. For example, the director gives a poor person access to one of the best universities in Brazil. On the other hand, a rich boy did not pass the exam to enter that university. I loved this because the director changed the typical stereotype. The director also did this with Jessicas' character by making her self-confident and fighting for her rights."
" n/a
",2017-11-27 00:00:00,10,"The movie, The Second Mother, is about a servant, who is called Val, who works for a family of money and has been there for a long time and one day Val's daughter, whose name is Jessica, calls her to ask if she can stay with her mom for while because she was studying for her exam which will determine if she will be able to enter the university or not. What happens is that, since she has been with that family for so long, she was the one who took care of the son, Fabinhode, of her employers, so she sees Fabinho as a son and he sees her as a mother, even though he has a mother. Now when Jessica comes to live with her mother, she thinks that she will live with only her mother in her house but Val lives with her employees. When Jessica finds out about this, she does not like it. The reason is because as her mother works for them, she does not have all the freedom that one wants. There are many examples of the passive struggle between Jessica and Val's boss, Doña Bárbara. Jessica does not understand why she can not do certain things while she lives there and that's what makes her angry. Meanwhile, the unfaithful father of the family, husband of Doña Bárbara, called Don Carlos, is interested in Jessica because she is a young, beautiful, intelligent, academic woman. There is a scene in which Don Carlos asks Jessica to marry him, but he tries to play it as a joke, but you can tell he meant it. The conclusion of the film was comforting, at least for me. Jessica ends up passing her exam and Val decides to move with Jessica and leave her job as a maid. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes heartwarming movies."
" Truly an amazing film
",2017-11-27 00:00:00,10,"Que horas ela volta? makes my list of the top five films I've seen in 2017. It is a wonderfully crafted film which explores the intricacies of classism and sexism through the lens of a very likable and extremely caring protagonist. Val, a live-in maid nanny for a very rich family of three in São Paulo, leads a very routine life, cleaning, cooking and caring for her employer's son. Unfortunately, in order to do this and make a living she had to leave her daughter in the care of her friends and relatives back home in the North. Years go by without seeing Jéssica, and eventually a falling out occurs—even communication via telephone has ceased. Then, out of the blue, Val receives a call from Jéssica; she's coming to São Paulo in order to take placement exams to enter into one of the most elite universities in the country. Val is excited and prepares her a space in her room, with a new mattress bought by Dona Barbara, the mistress of the home. Unfortunately, everything doesn't go as Val plans. Chaos rules the day as the independent Jéssica clashes with social norms and the inherent inequality of her mother's position in the world.The story-line of this film was not the only aspect of it which I enjoyed. Overall the acting, the political commentary, the cinematography and the emotional clarity of the movie drew me in. As a person from a place with very strict class distinctions and social rules to regulate interactions between classes, I found both Val's worries and Jéssica's hatred of the inequality she saw to be believable and relatable. If I were to pick any movie to show someone to introduce them to Latin American cinema, I would use this movie. It is a testament to the cinematographic abilities of Brazil and of its director Anna Muylaert."
" Feel good, while feeling bad
",2017-11-26 00:00:00,8,"A realistic view into the ever-present but never-mentioned class barrier, The Second Mother addresses social identity problems through the eyes of a lifetime maid and her renegade teen daughter. Val works tirelessly for almost nothing in return, and at times we can't help but feel sorry for her. The family that she serves is obviously of stature, and at times they seem to treat Val like a part of the family. But it is all the other times that reveal exactly what it is like for someone in the same situation as Val. It only gets worse when her daughter, Jesica, arrives at the house. Dr. Carlos seems to take a liking to her, so she is allowed special privileges in the house that make Val very uncomfortable. Throughout the movie, it is eluded to that Barbara is the head of the household. She gives stern orders to Val, but also shows interest in her life when Val mentions the arrival of her daughter. This is ironic, because it is ultimately Barbara who shuns Jesica out of the house. For me, it is difficult to see someone as hardworking as Val be treated the way that she is, but that is the realization of social classes. I believe at one point in the movie, Val tells Jesica that all of the rules are in place for them because that is just how it is, that is how it has always been. In the end, it is Jesica that serves as motivation for Val to resist the status quo, and ultimately join Jesica on her renegade journey. The two of them together set off to find themselves and perhaps challenge the strangling social norms that have resisted their success in the past."
" An elegant and beautiful film
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,7,"This movie is based around a live-in servant Val and the three people she serves: the father, his daughter and her son. Despite living in the same house as her three masters, Val is very subservient and looked down upon. She does not swim in her master's pool, does not eat at the same table as them, nor does she eat the same food. Val's life is turned upside down when her daughter Jessica comes to stay in order to sit the university entrance exams; a university that is only for the elite. Despite her mother's insistence and pleading, Jessica refuses to conform to the role of servant's daughter with interesting consequences that are not stereotypical.The second mother is beautifully done. The acting is superb. The story is told elegantly showing not just the injustice of class, but presenting it for the ugly beast it is. What I particularly liked about it was that Jessica's role was not overdone and stereotyped. The character was not deliberately being antagonistic, she was simply being herself and that meant refusing to conform to class social norms. If you get the chance to see this film I urge you to do so."
" Upstairs/downstairs tragi-comedy
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,8,"There's no getting around it, The Second Mother is just an excellent, excellent film, which cleverly balances multiple tones and issues while at the same time staying consistent, enjoyable and heartbreaking. The mother of the title is Val (a deglammed Regina Casé), a woman from rural Brazil who has spent the better part of her life as a combination of housekeeper and nanny to a wealthy family. Though she has a daughter of her own, for the most part she has spent her maternal feelings on Fabinho, the spoiled teenage son of her employers. When Val receives a call from her daughter, Jéssica, telling her that Jéssica intends to study for exams to become an architect, Val is thrilled and overwhelmed. She asks her employers (who also house her) if Jéssica can stay with her, and when they say yes she is hopeful that the mother-daughter reunion will go well. But Jéssica's arrival exposes the fact that for all her employer's posturing that Val is one of the family, she is actually subservient, having to obey various rules and codes that constantly put her in her place. And Jéssica's arrival completely throws off balance the simple life Val once led. To say more would be to spoil the movie, but Anna Muylaert is such an assured director and the way she handles her material is fresh and clever."
