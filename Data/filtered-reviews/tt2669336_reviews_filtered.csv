" It's worth a watch but not as good as people say it is on here
",2021-03-16 00:00:00,5,"I'm a sucker for time travel related movies so I'm giving this movie a lot more credit than it deserves. The premise is very unique and the movie is very story oriented so I give it a big thumbs up for that. However the characters are sooo dumb that it ruins any immersion required to enjoy the movie. They constantly make bad choices and have mood swings that is very unfitting for the character or the situation. For these movies I hold disbelief in favor of more fantasy or what-if type of mindset but the constant unrealistic acting and choices made by the character in the movie really kills the enjoyment for me. It's worth watching, better than the mindless CGI action films these days but a struggle to get through in certain parts of the film."
" Loved it
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,10,"Loved it! The ending is really suitable and interesting. When you finish watching the movie, it makes you think more and more about its concept and it's great. George Finn's character - the best:)"
" A nice try, but not convincing enough.
",2021-02-03 00:00:00,5,"""Don't mess with time"", one of the characters in this movie wisely warns. In my experience movies that deal with time-travelling, -shifting, -jumping or whatever one will call it, never succeed in overcome the difficulties of logic and plausibility and sooner or later all stumble over the notorious time-paradox. And movies that try to convince you with all kinds of (semi) scientific arguments have a tendency to just baffle and confuse you. It's the same in this movie.The premise itself is fairly original: three friends come across a mysterious device that takes pictures that reveal the future as it exactly is 24 hours ahead. They decide to use it for their profit, by predicting the outcome of dogs-races. Soon they are met with big problems, like an angry bet-collector and mutual suspicion and strain amongst themselves.Now I consider myself as reasonably intelligent, but I didn't understand anything of how they were using these photo's. What with this sticking of cardboards behind the window with instructions? It seemed to me as if they not so much used the information of the future, but constantly were trying to live up to the predictions. It didn't help that they all three were rather unsympathetic, and that some of their actions (like the murders!) seemed utterly out of sync with their previous sluggish and dull attitudes, and with that hardly credible.In my opinion: a nice try, with a promising premise, but way too ambitious and, as so often with time-shift movies, in the end unconvincing and dissapointing."
" Excellent scifi thriller , great cast, well directed!!
",2021-02-02 00:00:00,9,"This is how a low budget thriller is made they used excellent acting directing and a great story to make it all work. It's not ex machina but it's a great scifi thriller none the less. Has a excellent twist that you'll love and it fit the plot perfectly. Very well written, acted, directed and filmed. If you appreciate all of those things in a film....here you go!! ENJOY!!!"
" Plot holes galore
",2021-01-27 00:00:00,4,"Must be the most open-minded apartment complex in the world, or the entire population must have moved out, or it's actually a center for recluses. That's the only explanation for why people can have sex and brandish guns in full view of the (almost) full-length living room window. Come to think of it, I hardly saw anyone else throughout the movie, save for a security guard on patrol (but hey, don't let him get in the way of the exhibition, right?).And prior to the events of the story, these guys never once noticed that a camera lens the size of a tank cannon has been pointing at them all this while?"
" Interesting
",2020-12-25 00:00:00,6,Interesting and smart scenario apart from a few bumps along the way. I guess drugs where written into the script to explain some idiotic decisions that where made.
" Cant believe how bad it is
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,1,Worst movie ever. Cant believe the rate over 6. Poor acting. Painfull.
" A very enjoyable bad movie
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,10,"Im sure everyone worked very hard on it, nut in my opinion, pretty much everything was terrible. There were good moments, cool concepts, but overall, the characters were unrelatable and overreactive, the plot was a bit of a mess (though still followable.) I watched this movie at 3am with my friends and we had a great time, but you wont get much out of the movie itself."
" Believe it or not, these characters aren't stupid, they are fated
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,8,"Well, not *unusually* stupid.Why doesn't Jasper put up winning lottery numbers instead of race results? Thus, avoiding dealing with the bookie and his henchman? Because he doesn't.They come up with this reasoning that they have to do what's in the photo of the future, else they'll die or something, which is rather dubious.But it doesn't matter what their reasoning is. These people are experiencing a self consistent time stream. They don't actually change anything at all. They have no free will. They are automatons. All their thoughts, reasoning, actions are written in stone.-I like it a lot and find it repeatedly engrossing. I've probably watched it at least ten times and am always sucked right into it.I think the acting is great, even Ivan, the bookie. He's pretty funny, and it seems not everybody is sold on him, but he works for me. He DOES come across like he's acting, but that's because the character is acting like he thinks a bookie should act.And for a low budget movie, the bulk of which occurs in one apartment, it looks great. I don't think it ever feels stale due to that, and that's no small feat.My only complaint from that department is when they discover the camera (a nice prop). The three leads look over at it, and it cuts to an insert of the camera, which is obviously an insert since the characters should have been visible."
" Surprisingly good
",2020-11-13 00:00:00,7,"For a small budget film, the acting was good, the plot interesting and the production values top notch. As much as I thought I would, I couldn't look away."
" Wtf
",2020-10-22 00:00:00,1,"SHE CANT CHANGE THE PAST .. the camera isn't a time machine , you can see the future but you can't change the past , the pictures she hid are from the past , this doesn't make any sense . Nor any of the characters actions .
How can they be so stupid and make stupid decisions is beyond me .
Also .. WORST acting I've ever seen ."
" Started well, got worse the more they stretched it out
",2020-10-07 00:00:00,4,"I like real time travel movies, with thought behind them. No not mainstream trash such as 'Back to the Future'.No, I like 'Primer' and 'Source code', 'Twelve Monkeys'... movies where the writers actually thought about what they were doing and what happens to the characters over time.Now in this movie the three main characters are kind of unlikable, this creates an issue when watching this for over an hour and a half. The worst character by far is the ditsy girlfriend who at the hour and a half mark has an exposition dump to the viewer. She then ends up murdering people left and right, I don't really like that and think it makes the story become a cheap twist instead of actually having an intelligent point to make.Then there are other characters such as the bookie guy, who is played in a terrible way and it really is quite bad how the movie sinks when he shows up.Last thing, the time travel mechanism with the camera is a little poorly thought out and doesn't really make any sense how it works. I don't think the writer tried to solve the puzzle before filming this.4/10."
" After read the good reviews, I doubt if we are watching the same movie
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,4,"The movie is a mediocre, if not below average. Why everyone said their acting is good?The acting is just embarrasing, and the story is thin like paper. But it could be due to budget restrain, anyhow 5 is the best I could give"
" Only thing bothering me...
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,8,Playing shady illegal dog race betting instead of just writing out Powerball or some other lottery numbers and become instant millionaires? That is really stupid.
" One of the most smart and amazing movies I've ever seen!
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,10,"Just finished this movie in 2020, i am mind blown the plot is amazing and the story very interesting. definitely recommend this. wait until the end!"
" NOW I GET IT
",2020-08-28 00:00:00,7,"I did not get it after the final shot. I was left wondering 'how can she think she's sending messages to herself when all she can ever see are pictures from the future?' She would need the machine to show pictures of the past in order to send herself messages about changing the future, right?It turns out that there is a world we do not see. There are alternate universes/timelines which exist 24 hours apart. In effect, for the story's sake, there are 3 parallel timelines.
1. The only one we see, where the characters are seeing the future and copying it.
2. The future, which is always exactly what the pictures show.
3. The most important one to understanding the whole film, where they are actually sending messages to their past selves 24 hours ago.The 3rd one explains how they can post the race results that already finished and somehow make money after the fact. The money is actually being made by the characters living in the past, not the present. The 3rd one also explains how Callie can manipulate events 24 hours in the future, but the 2nd one explains how nothing actually changes despite her thinking she can change it."
" Convincing, great twists and turns, surprising.
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,8,"Completely underrated which makes you wonder how IMDB operates sometimes. Because it has a 'teen flick' feel, people must give it 0 without watching it in full.It's anything but. It's cleverly put together, the script is brilliant, and it's very well produced. A must for sci/fi fantasy / time travel fans."
" Good concept but too slow hadda bath half way
",2020-07-31 00:00:00,3,Maybe the second half picks up don't know first hour was like time going backwRds thru time so if yu can suffer 60 minutes of tedium in the hope it picks up good for yu I can't
" This movie makes 100% sense, some caveats
",2020-07-30 00:00:00,8,"There are some questions people raise about why these characters don't do something a whole lot smarter, like send themselves winning lottery numbers. But they believe they MUST do what's in the photo, and in the photos, Jasper is holding up dog race results. Their reasoning is goofy, about screwing with time being fatal, but at the end of the day, they are absolutely fated to do what's in the photos. Jasper never held up winning lottery numbers because he never held up winning lottery numbers.Mr. B's last photo was ultimately fulfilled exactly. There were no actual changes in their destinies.They are on a road that has no turns.It's quite obviously low budget, almost entirely in one apartment, but it never feels like that. It is pretty darn gripping all the way through and the best micro budget movie I can recall. I've watched it several times, and find it gripping each time.The cover art is very misleading.Also, the ending gets the girl arrested with lots of murdered bodies around. It's funny to think of the presumed criminal trial that would result. I'm not sure what her best story would be, but there is a time travel camera that can be put into evidence. It actually isn't a terrible sequel hook."
" Mind Bender!
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,10,"What a fantastic flick! I get bored with movies extremely easily, and Time Lapse had me holding my breath with suspense from the first minutes! My attention was fully on the screen every second.I loved everything-the believable actors, the surprising plot twists, the intriguing concept, the claustrophobic setting, and the minimal score.Bravo to all for making an excellent film!"
" Great movie
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,7,"The movie has a great pace, well written.The actor are good we really can see the emotional change through the movie. I really liked the twist they put on time travel."
" Good sci-fi thriller movie
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,7,"I would say that for a low budget movie this has done very good. The concept , screenplay and writing - they have done very well.
Don't compare it with big movies or with big directors because you will end up not satisfied.Watch it without expectations and you will enjoy it. This movie has done more than enough in this segment."
" Highly underrated film
",2020-05-19 00:00:00,9,"If you're into science fiction movies, and specially if they are related with ""time travel"", don't hesitate to watch it. The idea is original, the story makes perfect sense and it keeps surprising you until the end of the movie. The only thing that prevented me from rating it 10/10 is that some decisions that the main characters make just don't make sense."
" A lesson for the big timers
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,7,This movie is a master piece of how good film can be made on budget no A list actors no CGI no glorious settings and yet this film is brilliant whoever can make a film with with a Skeleton cast and one Room are pure genius in my eyes reminds me of classic Hitchcock dual M for murder and rope but without the A listers which is a credit to the actors well worth a watch.
" Student film
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,9,"This movie is a good example of low budget student film. Several actors, one location. 9/10 because such movies usually suck but this one is interesting. Good idea, good script development."
" Young Adult Science Fiction
",2020-03-27 00:00:00,1,"*Maybe* when I was younger...This is a young adult fiction summer date night movie. I was unable to connect with the characters and story, and the exceptionally poor writing and acting did not help.I am indeed pretty picky when it comes to science fiction, but I often enjoy under-appreciated movies (and books) without requiring a bunch of action and special effects so long as their stories are solid and the acting is proper. This movie did nothing for me other than increase the intensity of my desire to find some other way to spend my time.I do not want to enter the realm of screed writing. So... For me, it was a one-star waste of time.Maybe you will like it."
" An entertaining film that keeps your attention
",2020-02-13 00:00:00,6,"Time Lapse has a decent script and performances from the cast. I have to point out that the decision to cut the one actor from the movie with any star power (John Rhys-Davies portraying Mr. Bezzerides) seems odd. Scenes were filmed but didn't make the final cut. Aside from that, the premise (though not entirely original) kept my attention, as did the plot twists and suspense. Despite the obvious low budget, the film makers did a fine job putting it all together. Worth a watch."
" Decide Yourself!
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,5,"Time lapse can you really change your future thats already a past?, plot: (Three friends discover a mysterious machine that takes pictures twenty-four hours into the future, and conspire to use it for personal gain, until disturbing and dangerous images begin to develop) if you read the plot it looks something intresting to discover, this is a low budget so don't have high expectations on it, i personally didn't know whether i enjoyed it or not, a ok story of time travel but it could have been better you are expecting to see something interesting but it just doesn't deliver anything shocking, characters are just ok everyone can take the roles since its a low budget, directing cinematography and soundtrack are ok, the script is lacking even if it was a low budget they could have done it better, no compliments on a B grade movie, i don't know to recommend this to anyone but if you are a hardcore time travel fan try it yourself, 4.5/10⭐"
" A thrill to watch until the end
",2019-12-06 00:00:00,7,"The movie was exciting and every new day came with a new mystery. I liked how they managed to pull such a movie in only two adjacent apartments. It was an exhilarating ride.According to my rating strategy:
Story:1.5/2, Actors:1.5/2, Viewer:2/2, Task Fulfillment:1/1, Wow Factor:0/1, Directing, Cinematography and Soundtrack:1/2"
" For the bad reviewers
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,10,"You people are some kind of stupid. I mean the various bad reviews basically come down to the following explanations:1. ""Plot makes no sense"" - hate to break it to the coco puffs who couldn't follow simple logic but the plot is ultra tight. It's very difficult to do a time travel movie without the usual paradoxes but bravo to the writers, there are no gaps or loopholes in this one. Betting on the day's races makes sense because you have the photo from the previous night telling you the next day's winnings. That next day you go to the track to bet on those names, collect your winnings, and then post the winners for that evening's photo. Why people are confused by this is idiotic. The only criticism I agree with is that yes instead of dog races they should have just picked something else like the day's stock prices. You can quickly turn a few dollars into a fortune using stock options. No one would care or get mad that you have a huge winning streak in the stock market. And no you can't do the lottery or powerball because those drawings occur usually much later at night after 8pm.2. ""Acting was bad"" - sorry to all you Siskel and Ebert wannabes but the acting performances by each and every one of the cast was impressive. I mean reaalllly impressive. I was blown away by their emotions, expressiveness, and timing. Kudos to the director as well. Wow they hit every mark. The 3 leads did exceptionally great jobs. Forget about the fact that this was an indie film, if all indie films had acting like this, there'd be no need for big Hollywood productions. Shocked that the 3 leads aren't bigger stars than they are. Fire those lackadaisical agents. I mean George's performance of Jasper, a druggie who's desperate and has gone unhinged... brilliant. Danielle's performance of Callie, a frustrated girlfriend who feels unloved, and resorts to manipulation and deceit... moving. Matt's performance of Finn, the disillusioned painter who longs for inspiration and the level headed protagonist... spot on (the way he slowly took off Callie's ring.... so poignant and heartbreaking). And for Bradley King the Director, tremendous job on a limited budget. If it were up to me he would be picked by Disney to direct the rest of the Star Wars franchise.3. ""Didn't like the ending"" - laughably wrong. The ending kept the entire story in place and was the payoff we needed and wanted. Remember the basic question of the story: ""can you F- with time?"" Finn thinks, after Dr Leidecker's revelation that Mr B died from thorium gas and not a causality paradox, that he can change his future irrespective of what the photo showed the night before. That he is the master of his own destiny. While Callie finally revealed that she had been a slave to the photos, the entire time, she at the end also thought she can perhaps change time to save herself from being caught in the window and ultimately having to kill Finn. In the end they were both wrong because of a slip of a piece of scotch tape. Time is cruel. You can't F- with time as Jasper warned and he was right. No gaps, no loopholes, no paradoxes. Brilliant ending."
" Like many I thought the concept was flawed. It works, actually.
",2019-08-26 00:00:00,10,"I was initially tricked into thinking there was a big logical flaw, despite being quite familiar with time paradoxes. I have noticed other reviewers fell into this trap. This is surely due to a lack of clarity and rythm at the beginning. I almost got bored and did not pay enough attention. Was it because I wasn't quite in the mood ? Who knows. It did not ""catch"" me.But the movie works.In the present the camera sends you a picture of the future. When the future becomes the present, you could say the camera is actually sending a picture in the past. Which was the present when you received it from the future. And so on ...That's the time loop the movie is built upon. Nice ...The script works, a bit rough on the edges maybe. It took me a while to get into. The beginning is somewhat clunky, lazy. A few scenes and dialogues are half baked, but it doesn't ruin the movie. Actors are ok. Interiors are depressing. Colors are just sad. The image is actually quite plain, lacking a signature, there's no magic for the eye. But it is effective as far as the narrative goes. The characters may not take great decisions, but that's how they are : not very smart. Great twists. Smart ending.So, why a 10 ? Because of the lasting impression. Quite a paradox.Not a masterpiece, but I have seen big budget movies fail on similar themes."
" One of the worst movies I have seen in a while.
",2019-08-20 00:00:00,1,"I absolutely adore indie and low budget films and to that I love movies crafted with passion to bring a unique idea to life. This movie had a unique idea and unique stance. Unfortunately following that the film fell short in every single way when it comes to unrealistic character development , flat performance and overall a totally delusional script. Skip this movie."
" Decent Suspense Thriller
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,6,"A indie SciFi thrillerPlot:A group of three friends discovers a unique camera which is invented by neighbour n it predicts the future events by photos...Story is very simple a three friends decide to misuse their own future events for some gains (Gambling) but its end up with shocking n UnexpectedThis Movie actually not much explains about a SciFi logic behind the camera,its almost like a suspence thriller with time travel Fiction as a template
Basically timelapse is a One location film with very minimal characters,so its looks visually uninteresting to watch up to 105mins...Really a Good Concept but Ruined by ultra low budget making and D level casting choice..."
" Good movie but bad paintings
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,7,"That dude Finn, makes the worst paintings i have ever seen. Those paintings is a so ridiculous that its hard for me to comprehend. But if i block out the show that is those paintings its an entertaining movie."
" someone needed to explain to the writer how the future worked.
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,1,"So here's the basic premise as I understand it...Trio finds camera that shows pictures 24 hours in the future. So you find the picture of Tuesday 8pm on Monday 8pm. Good - interesting, filled with possibility.To manipulate the future and help them make money, they start to post the winners of dog races. Huh? So on Monday, you're posting that day's winners in the window (how else would you know who won the races if they haven't already been run) which will be photographed later that day and theoretically show you the events of 24 hours in the future. You'd have to know the winners for Tuesday's races to place bets on Monday.I'm sure I'm missing something but there are so many other bad, stupid, remarkably idiotic decisions that none of these people deserved to live regardless."
" well done for low budget BUT.....
",2019-06-28 00:00:00,2,"The premise is all wrong. Three huge problems. Bookies, sports bets, pushing fate and zero reasons whatsoever for doing so. Absolutely anyone with anything resembling coherent thought would simply take a pic of themselves holding winning powerball numbers. Four separate states waiting for strong 9 figure payoffs. Drama and danger is cool and all but anyone that stupid deserves to get offed."
" One reaps what one sows
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,4,"When you're the scriptwriter of a movie dealing with time travel, the easiest and cheapest way is to write a script built with protagonists as moronic as pathetic. Let's name them Callie, Finn and Jasper. Then, the plot twists will follow one after the other, at a frenetic pace, until Callie, Finn and Jasper ineluctably lost control like Juliet, David and Alex in Shallow Grave (1994). Although the first twenty minutes are rather encouraging, the last thirty ones are disappointing and almost appalling."
" Very well done !
",2019-06-09 00:00:00,7,"Well, I enjoy this theme ! The movie was great ! You don't really need to know what's really going on with the machine and the final twist is decent."
" Really enjoyed this one
",2019-05-27 00:00:00,9,"Yes, the girl's motivations are fairly absurd and all that, the ending is too violent etc. But the main part of the movie is just gripping. Builds up a major supernatural atmosphere. Also that triangle situation was intriguing. Definitely a great experience to watch."
" Good movie... They have closed the loops properly
",2019-05-21 00:00:00,7,"Depending upon your taste for writing, some of you would absolutely love this film and some would bash it to the ground. I personally loved the film. The writer did an amazing job to close the loop, without building too much alternate realities-- what could be possible or what couldn't be.There is just one forced scene where the female lead passes info to the bookie guy. That was kinda forced for the plot to involve those two characters. Besides that, a great film at such budget."
" Engaging Time Travel Thriller
",2019-05-08 00:00:00,7,"I was hooked from the start by the quality of the acting, direction and camera work. The main characters kept me interested in this time travel thriller. The direction was tight and the film well edited. The camera work was brillant. and the setsand props were good for a low budget film. I particularly liked the chemistry between three main leads."
" Worth the watch
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,7,It could have been tighter and the plot certainly had holes and felt a bit rushed. However it was a good idea and carried out well with enough twists and tension to make it worth it.
" Not Bad, Not Good Either
",2019-01-20 00:00:00,5,"Low budget, science fiction movie that harps on it's novelty would be clever if not for the terrible acting and poor writing. The gimmick of the movie makes sense, the possibilities it offers are not realized beyond sophomoric interactions and limited money-making schemes of a small group of friends. It's really a shame to wonder just how good this movie could have been if in the hands of a competent director and better acting. So much potential for an explosive and well-made movie is wasted. Skip this one unless there isn't anything better to watch."
" Thrilling!
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,9,It is a thrilling wild ride with a good twist. We really loved this one!
" Another nice surprise low-budget sci-fi movie plagued by uneven acting
",2019-01-01 00:00:00,6,Another nice surprise low-budget sci-fi movie! Too bad the uneven acting kills the drama a bit.
" Don't listen to people.
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,10,I know. That means you shouldn't listen to me as well. But since you've read this far...better complete it.The movie is really good compared to other low-budget SciFi movies. The story is so beautifully crafted. This is one of those rare gems like Predestination.
" starsAT 18, EVERYONE WANTS TO BE AN ARTIST
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,10,"Finn (Matt O'Leary) is an apartment manager who fancies himself a painter. He lives in a flat with his waitress girlfriend Callie (Danielle Panabaker) and sports betting buddy Jasper (George Finn). When the newspapers start to pile up at the neighbors place, they investigate only to find a camera that takes photos a day in advance. The camera is bolted in place and faces the threesomes' living room window. This takes on interesting aspects for a gambler. The owner of the camera has passed on and now our threesome live their lives to make sure they don' t ""mess with time"" by ensuring they match whatever the photo tells them to do.This is a wicked good low budget sci-fi drama. The film takes some twists and then evolves into a Hitchcock style classic. With 15 indie wins under its belt, this is one film that will make you forget ""Primer.""Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity."
" Ughhh so boring
",2018-11-11 00:00:00,1,I literally fell asleep on this. Twice. Balls. Watch something else.
" Sketchy reviews, horrific film
",2018-09-12 00:00:00,1,"First review I've ever written because this movie stole hours from my life. It'd be an understatement to call the characters in this film stupid. Really, they are completely brainless, their actions designed to simply move the plot forward into worse and worse situations, as the writers seem unable to. Usually in a film with dumb characters, there's at least one person you still root for, to escape the forcefield of stupidity. Here, each character is more reprehensible than the last."
" One of the best films I have seen in a very long time.
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,10,From the beginning to the end there was not a dull moment that did not make sense to the film. I really was able to relate to point of views portrayed for each character considering the situations. I really enjoyed this film. The awards were well deserved.
" The chick can't act.
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,7,"The idea behind this film is great, the script and even dialogue are both well done. The major issue with this film is the acting; mainly from the girlfriend character - the chick from The Flash television show. You do not really notice her subpar acting skills in The Flash because she is more or less a background character. In this film however, she is front and center and stinks up the screen. She is pretty, that is for sure. Plus she has an amazing body but she just has no acting believability; a result, it brings down what could have been a sci-fi cult classic. What a shame."
" Couldn't get passed Jasper's acting
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,2,"I love time travel themed movies, but I sadly could not get past the acting in this movie. I really wanted to like it because the premise is interesting. But every time Jasper opened his mouth and spoke, I drifted further and further away from this movie."
" Concept Is Flawed
",2018-06-13 00:00:00,1,"The whole concept is flawed. If I put up scores in the window from today and went and viewed a photo that shows the room 24 hours in the future, the scores would in deed be there if I didn't take them down. But the event would have still taken place yesterday and betting on the games wouldn't win you any money. The only way it might work is if you snapped a photo of the TV or something live that had the sports channel on and showing the scores of 24 hours in the future."
" Ending Twist really Screws the movie
",2018-05-27 00:00:00,3,"Will I didn't mind this movie as I was watching it. Yes it is not the best but was ok even though it was Twilight Zone meet Dawson's creek. The acting was a bit flat though better then the script/plot. Camera taking photos of the future (next day). The camera was impressive though it was not really explained. 
So why did I give it such a low score (3). The ending which I refer to as the Ending Twist seems to have been written by somebody else as it does not follow the plot of the main movie. The role of the main female has many holes in it. 
The movie is about a camera taking photo's today showing what is going to be there tomorrow, that is it. Come the end of the movie and the movie plot changes to something that I cannot put into words without being confusing, it seems to change into a time machine that allows you to change the past.
So really 4/5ths of the movie is good, just don't try to understand the end bit which is played by the Female lead."
" Really enjoyed it, with one plot hole
",2018-04-29 00:00:00,10,"I think this is an amazing film, even more so given that it's an independent low budget film. The story and acting were just superb. Truly a great piece of sci-fi that seems to already be a bit of a cult hit on streaming.My only problem is this plot hole: Remember Ivan had broken their old fashioned clock and they had to replace it with a digital one? The old photo of Jasper/Callie coupling while Finn was asleep took place weeks ago so it should have the old clock in the photo. You'd think Jasper and Finn would notice that upon first seeing it and know it could not be a photo of the next day's events."
" Riveting and unique
",2018-04-02 00:00:00,9,"A lot of themes in movies get done so many times that they become relentlessly predictable. But not here. This movie is unlike anything I've ever seen, which was pleasantly surprising. The storytelling and pacing are well done, along with the acting. Highly recommend!"
" Time Lapse- Fascinating but rudimentary
",2018-03-15 00:00:00,5,"Time Lapse: Directed by Bradley King and written by Bradley King and BP Cooper.Time Lapse is a story about three friends who find a giant camera that takes a picture of the future. They are tempted by what it could bring and eventually everything turns out pretty much how you think with the exception of one thing.This is a low budget sci fi movie that uses creativity and ingenuity to better serve without making things look and feel cheap. It takes place between three apartments and a storage room. You understand completely why that is and become invested in the story and the characters. However even with that you see exactly what will happen a mile away with the lone exception being the ending twist.You have three roommates two guys and one girl. The girl and one of the guys are in a relationship that appears to be stagnating. The other guy has shown himself to be a tad untrustworthy and a bit of a gambling addict. You give them the ability of time travel and you know the story already word for word.The performances are really good though. They allow you to believe in what is happening even if you know what that is before it happens. It is still a fairly enjoyable ride. Danielle Panabaker seems a bit one note and doesn't benefit from a a character change late in the proceedings. This movie being as low budget and location closed off as it is lives and dies on the performances and they were able to hold me interested.This is not a bad movie. You don't need to go out of your way to seek it out but if you do decide to watch it, you will be entertained. I give this movie a C."
" The worst movie I've ever seen
",2017-11-01 00:00:00,1,"Decided to give this movie a shot after seeing it on a recommended list and seeing it had a decent IMDb score, and boy did I regret it. To no surprise 90% of the users that rated 8 or higher have this as their only review and their accounts were created shortly before or after the movie's release. The premise was original I guess, but the character's logic was non-existent and the acting was just terrible. Every line sounded like it was being read directly off the script. I've never felt compelled to actively review/rate a bad movie but I had to offset at least one of the fake reviews that tricked me into wasting my time on this trash."
" Poor writing decisions undermine the movie
",2017-10-22 00:00:00,5,"A really interesting premise ruined by absurd character behaviour! You know in advance the results of races and place all the bets with one, and only one, dodgy dangerous bookie. No ten or fifteen different Internet accounts with bet sites for you. Let's put every single bet, no accumulators mind, with just one violent scary underground bookie. Plainly ridiculous. As was much that followed. Performances by the actors were decent enough and the main time photo idea was interesting.By the end the female protagonist decides to kill her own boyfriend, in order to change what's already happened, but doesn't kill the cop who calls at her door, just casually and strangely letting him in to see two corpses on her floor! Bizarre! How can the writers screw up such a good idea with lazy, odd, absurd and surreal choices? So much promise, ruined with poorly considered and idiotic writing choices 5/10"
" Predict or Dictate?
",2017-10-18 00:00:00,6,"Imagine finding a camera that takes a Polaroid of the future. Now imagine being able to see yourself doing whatever it is you will be doing 24 hours from now. Now what if I tell you that if you don't do what the picture shows, your life will end - you've seen evidence pointing to this so you have to believe that theory. The mechanised augur naturally ceases being an automated crystal ball of sorts and becomes an inanimate autocrat, forcing you to recreate the imagery in the snapshot of your future, that you bore witness to yesterday...Head hurting yet?Time paradox movies will always have their flaws because, well, logic! This movie, however, tries it's best at explaining why the characters do what they do. This movie doesn't try to talk-down to the viewer nor does it dumb-down for the viewer.All-in-all a clever little film that does well on a low budget."
" excellent movie
",2017-09-18 00:00:00,9,i found this movie very interesting the plot was amazing and i hope you make other film that shows the last photo what happens after that or make the past about Mr. Bezzerides. excellent movie with the plot twist the actors are playing the roles as exactly how would be the agony is increasing all the time and you want to see what happens next
" Nope, Nope, NOPE and more NOPE!
",2017-07-21 00:00:00,1,"DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. IT WILL TRIGGER YOU. I have never been so mad after watching a movie.. Stuff Panabaker and all she stands for. I will never watch another movie with her in it. I literally lost sleep over this movie.. Not because I was scared, sad, or upset in any way... I was legitimately ANGRY. That chick was cheating on the only dude in the movie that I liked for months on end and then she chose to break it to him like THAT!?!? No. Bye Falecia. Then she killed my mans?!? ABSOLUTELY NOT OKAY. That chick better have gone to jail for the rest of her life after that crap. I hope she gets with a cute little chick in prison and then that chick cheats on her for months before finally breaking the news to her via pictures that were taken a day into the future. I will never get that time back.. I strongly advise you to NEVER watch this movie. I have never written a movie review before, but I felt compelled to warn all the good folks in the world NOT to watch this movie. It will make you angry if you have any feelings about slimy women cheating on solid dudes."
" Mildly entertaining but....
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,4,"Time Lapse is one of those movies that rely on several contrivances to have much of a plot. Right away one is left wondering why the trio didn't merely buy a lottery ticket instead of betting on greyhound races, much less bet them thru a bookie. I didn't need the pictures the machine popped out to know what was going to happen next. Still, it was fairly entertaining right up until the very end, when in it totally goes off the rails and stops making sense. Instead of getting pictures of tomorrow's events, which had been the premise of the movie, suddenly Callie is leaving herself ""camera notes"" to carry out tomorrow events that have already occurred in the present. By that point though I was ready for the ending. The main trio of actors did do a fine job with their characters, especially Danielle Pannabaker. Too bad the writer couldn't have come up with a better ending."
" Good story
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,8,"I gave this an 8 simply because I want to watch it again. It's interesting that I couldn't make up my mind on who to ""emphasize"" with. I seriously started to hate all of them. With the ending being the final sucker punch to deal with. So, the movie got me all worked up and now I have to see it again with a new perspective. That's why I gave it an 8."
" I wish I could've rated it 0 stars
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,1,"I don't mean to be rude, but I absolutely hated this movie. I truly wish I could've rated it 0 stars. There was tons of violence and murder that I really wish I could un-see. I thought the story line sounded interesting, but it was not played out well at all. Terrible acting, too. I wasted 2 hours of my life that I can never get back watching something that will most likely give me disturbing dreams."
" A Pseudoscientific bore
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,1,"So, we have the premise whereby a machine - apparently a camera but looking more like a Pizzeria oven - takes photographs exactly 24-hours Into the future. Now, one would think that, regardless of what the protagonists do, they are destined to end up doing precisely what the future-photo's reveal. That's Inevitable, It's the bread-and-butter of any decent time-twisting tale. But not this one....the whole premise Is seriously flawed! Instead of our 3 main characters Just waiting around In the full knowledge that whatever they do, the result will - must - match the photograph, they Instead have to create the situation to fit the photograph (wear the right clothes, paint the right picture, stand In the correct place and so on) - In other words, far from ""predicting the future"" they are shaping their thoughts and actions to match what's In the pictures! Utter nonsense! I could handle the fact that almost the entire movie Is filmed In one room, but the stupid Science has me chewing the carpet. I often make allowances for lower budgets, but not this time."
" Actually pretty good if you're willing to forgive some of the logic.
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,7,"I liked this movie. It is a fresh exploration into the vagaries of time travel. The results of knowing what shouldn't be known twist the characters psyche, and they take the belief in predetermination to religious proportions.There deep conjecture that drives this movie regards fate and personalities. They suggest that the photos are locked-in premonitions which drives the story for a time. No one can really tell how they'd react to the situation as portrayed so I don't mind going with the writers' characterizations on this point.I also give leeway as there were only short periods of time to make decisions, especially when those decisions began to require massive mental adjustments: murder, cheating, lying, jealousy, fear, anger, confusion, control. Then throw in a handful of pharmaceuticals and things got spiced up quickly. While I think some of the decisions made by the characters were pretty stupid, you have to allow that it might be possible that they'd act this way. If everyone did the logical and intelligent thing you wouldn't get much of a story.I quite like the ending. It is very believable that a person could lose their mind after going through these events.The budget was spent in the right places, and for such a limited set, the story was kept moving and didn't bog down.It is definitely worth a watch."
" High tech not needed for this great SciFi idea
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,8,"Time lapse is a great scifi movie. No special effects just a great story that carries you along with it. Its tense, dangerous and intriguing all at the same time. I never guessed the ending because this movie isn't predictable.Seeing the future and being able to change it starts off as a potential goldmine for these believable and interesting characters. Things go wrong for all the wrong reasons and our heroes lose control of themselves and their future."
" Great plot
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,7,"It has a very great plot, the acting is not that well and it has a low budget production. But don't get me wrong it's worth watching. Great plot!So take a chance and watch it on netflixps. Hope you like the ending."
" Nice ending, painful the rest of the time
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,3,"I really liked the ending. Although it was predictable it was interesting to see it build up. The processing and filming wasn't too bad (if you exclude the fadings at the beginning of the film) But the rest... The fact that it's an indie movie shouldn't make as an excuse. Primer's story-line was ten times better written and had a (very) small budget! Poor acting, poor characters (so typical), poor dialogues and a very weak story-line. The characters are so full of stereotypes: - Jasper directly wanting to make money of it but never thinking always winning would raise suspicion - Finn being directly against using the machine - Callie the victim of everything in the story It's too bad because I really like time travel and time distortion movies. In this one, it's just like they say in the movie: you don't mess with time. While watching, I could find a dozen ways to prevent the events to spinning down. I gave it a 4 four for not totally ruining the movie with an even worse ending."
