" As a coming of age story, this wasn't bad at all
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,8,"From my perspective, the point of the entire film was to show us how complex human behaviour and communication really is, especially after the internet. It shows briefly how our actions have consequences and it's a film for both parents and teenagers to watch and relate to, and maybe comprehend that we all struggle sometimes, making it important to ask for help. It screams at the audience that communication is key, therefore getting its message across, but it could have explored some plotlines a little bit more, making it a bit clearer."
" A pleasant surprise
",2020-12-10 00:00:00,9,"When I saw the name Adam Sandler I expected an over the top comedy but seriously, why has this gem been hidden from me for over 6 years? Both generations life so recognisable and accurately portrait. Beautiful storylines and interactions."
" A movie about life in the 10s of 21st century
",2020-11-23 00:00:00,10,I didn't get why this movie is so underrated here. The cast is awesome and the plot is really great.
" Loved it !
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,8,"Never heard of this film. Rating was not good. Did not cared about it. Liked the plot. After finishing watching it , I really have to say raters did not understand it. I think they did not finished watching it..."
" Ignore the rating
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,10,A very very impressive movie. You will not regret.
" Seriously underrated
",2019-06-22 00:00:00,9,"How is this not at least an 8? This must be the most underrated movie of 2014. Perhaps, in hindsight, it's become more meaningful to we users of technology over the 5 years since it was released."
" Most realistic depiction of high school life so far
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,9,"Movies centered around high school life usually follow the stereotypical route instead of giving the dark reality of school life. Normally high school movies show and/or depict love stories, rom-coms, party comedies, cliques, teenage girls who have a weird obsession to be perfect at all times, men trying to succeed and achieve their goals, teachers being diplomatic and catering to all students' needs, and unrealistic situations.This movie however shows a major portion of the dark truths of high school life and is damn realistic in its portrayal. It stays away from all that boy meets girl, men and women joining cliques for their own benefit, party animal things, sticks to the main plot and shows what true teenage angst is really like and how the modern family tries to maintain their so-called perfect American image rather than caring for their kids' needs or trying to understand how their kid feels.It has a variety of subplots but all work well within the context of the main story. The main story however is about how high school students and their family members mainly their parents use the internet to battle depression, sexual frustration, insecurities and other problems while at the same time trying to adjust to life itself.The movie doesn't have any huge set-pieces and every scene looks authentic from the school to their homes and everything else.Direction is superb, all performances look real. Story and screenplay is ahead of its time and rare for the modern era as well as no one dared to touch and tackle such a delicate and sincere topic.Cinematography is apt for the movie and the movie thankfully doesn't have a cheap lookNarration is good tooPerformances, it's difficult to say who was the best here:
Adam Sandler usually known for his goofy comedies and over-the-top childish antics sheds his image and puts on a remarkable act here, and he is perfect in the climax.
Ansel Elgort gives a realistic performance and he is just outstanding, both him and Sandler are a surprise.
Jennifer Garner puts on an excellent act
JK Simmons is awesome as always
Dean Norris is pretty good
Rosemarie DeWitt is outstanding she makes her act look real
Judy Greer is fantastic and so are the rest"
" Bad Parenting
",2019-05-02 00:00:00,6,"This movie tries and attempt at showing aspects of modern life revolving around the use of the internet in several different disconnected stories. It touches on some serious topics (many) but does so well. It is weird to see Adam Sandler in a role such as this but it is really a good representation of how he can succeed as more than just a comedian. Ansel Elgort really makes you feel and the repeated use of Carl Sagan's Pale Blue Dot has some deep meaning around the character. The visualized internet mixed with reality works in the film but is not something that I would recommend to be used often in future films. If I were to review just the story of Tim, Brandy, and their parents, I'd give it a 4.5 out of 5; but seeing as I'm reviewing the movie as a whole, I would have to give it what I gave it."
" pale blue dot
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,8,"I think this movie isn't about how technology effects our life. it's just a way to tell the story. it's about miscommunication. it's about misunderstood each other. when you look at it, in universe we mean nothing. we think we are so important(wanna be so important) but we are not. everyone has their own problems. and we are nothing. we'll fade out, turn into dust in the end. so our hatred doesnt mean anything, in case we should know this is our only life and we should live this. we should try to understand each other.if we won't,like in this movie we'll lose it before we realize. maybe we already did."
" made in 2014,but even more important...
",2018-12-28 00:00:00,10,"This is definately not an action film, neither a comedy,rather a spot on drama about the use,disuse,overuse,abuse of internet and social media, and loose connected peoples attitudes ,feelings,angst and misunderstanding of the digital age. its a mood film, and if my vibes had been on tunnelvision i might have switched it of, yes it is definately that kind of movie.i myself fell of the techwave in the late 80's,and only introduced pc's in the late 90's for the cause of our children (and my davis weather station), a mobile phone i got 5 yrs after my wife,why??? im a bit old-habbited,very little digitally curious,a bit overwhelmed and a bit suspicious. i have strict guidelines of my own use of digital data, but i have not messed , interferred or been actively suspicious upon my kids....my spouce though are a far greater risk one might say.....?!its a marvelous piece of film, and its dead on target from start to end.it mirrors the madness in parenthood,the wimsyness in an anorectic child, the promiscouitous innocence of teenagehood and adulthood, curiousity that blow back nearly fatally, how things get out of control,misunderstandings and so on....had i been a teacher for teenagers , i woulve screened this film for them as a reminder, and as recognition to their experiences vs.parents,friends and school and used it as a track of discussion of ones digital life and survival.the acting are flawless the teenagers are amazing and the whole production are so perfect so it is an inevitable 10 ,for men ,women and children."
" The dark side...
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,2,"Men, Women & Chikdren delivers a paradox.A prerequisite for accrediting this film any value is that you actually understand all good that the development of technology deliverers - and that's a big ask.If you are, totally, naive to the risks and downsides and have blind faith in ""being hooked"" on your phone there may be an ounce validity in the message.The message being that; we are living in dystopia - rather than it is heading our way. And it gets worse...The rhetoric verges on religious.
""Damned be ye"", damned be anyone who pushes the envelope of their current state. Apparently the long practiced; desire of your neighbor's better half becomes particularly precarious if the lust it realised by the use of the internet.Less specifically the message is; any use of the internet for the purpose of meeting anybody can only end up bad.Any trust that; humanity will sort out the problems faced by galloping technology - are blatantly lacking.The overall quality of the film resembles that of a pta meeting on std that has derailed.Men, Women & Children is lacking in almost all the requirements of good filmmaking. But it is potentially dangerous and so represents the very dark side it is trying to warn against."
" A Surprisingly Strong Film with Heart and Soul
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,9,"Wow. The 2014 film ""Men, Women & Children"" is amazing. The marketing blurb doesn't do justice to this adult themed coming of age tale about the intersection of on-line life and real life in the contemporary family, or the quality of the acting and storytelling this unusual gem offers. Adam Sandler leads a strong cast without any of his trademark humor, and delivers one of many solid performances in this surprising drama that ultimately raises existential questions about the meaning of life itself. See it."
" Good acting, bad script
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,5,"This Movie is inappropriate for children as it talks a lot about pornography and has inappropriate scenes of it. And also scenes of attempted suicide. I thought the intro beginning scene was a little to long and boring but I did like the voice over it give the Movie a type of documentary feel. This Movie is said to be a comedy but it wasn't really funny, there was only really 2 funny scenes at most. there was little to the story line, it felt like the story wasn't really fully developed, and the Movie was boring at times. i think the Movie could have been better if it had been written better. I think there were too many multiple points of view in this Movie and at times hard to keep track of everything. There were just way to many different characters.The characters all played certain stereotypes which they don't really have any personality. It tries to tackle other familiar social issues like porn addiction, unfaithfulness, anorexia, and video gaming by portraying how social media has changed the way we live our lives. It was also heavily one-sided and it never tried to portray the positive side of social media.
I think The Internet in itself is neither good nor bad; it's how it's used that matters. The Movie deals with some serious issues like pro ana and family issues which I think is good because we should talk more about things like that. I really liked the cast I think they did really good with what they had to work with, I think the acting was really good."
" Only made for contractual obligations to the studios
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,3,"The trailer is rather heavy, but be warned the actual movie is totally different!I really love some of director Jason Reitmans work, but this movie was forced upon Reitman by the hollywood studios, after his last movie flopped. Reitman had little control over the end product. His talent still shines through, but the end product is a boring mess, because the studios began interferring with the creative process in order to sell this depressing story at the box office. It failed miserably anyway...The problem is that this movie starts out pretty good. When I started watching it, I really was into it. Because of the great actors in it, I got seduced in watching it anyway, thinking it would be another great Reitman movie. WRONG. This is one of those movies that slowly grinds to a halt. The story is just a mess. There are way to many different characters. The movie lasts for 2 hours! Probably it is trying to be true to the story of the original book, but films that literally copy the storyline of books are often complete failures at the box office.The Internet in itself is neither good nor bad, it's how it's used that matters. Reitman tries to tackle the matter of how technology is retarding the way we relate to one another. For those who just came out of a cave and have never heard of the internet, yes for those ex-cave dwellers this would be the ideal movie! For anyone else this movie wil work better than a sleeping pill, because it is mindnumbingly boring and pointless."
" Exceptional
",2018-03-24 00:00:00,10,"If you like witty comedy or action movie violence look away. But if you like hard hitting drama with brilliant story telling fantastic acting and a serious and relevant plot then Men, Women and Children is perfect. 
M,W&C is a modern classic that forces the watcher to see the real world impact of sex, high school gossip and the internet. From porn addiction and peer pressure to the video game phenomenon that effects the vast majority of the western world's young adults this film not only shows the struggle of the parents but also an incitefull view at the teenage aspects of life"
" sad and cold
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,5,It's the modern world for a group of Texas high school teens and their parents. Celebrity obsessed Donna Clint (Judy Greer) is the mother of mean girl Hannah (Olivia Crocicchia) who puts her on a website. Patricia Beltmeyer (Jennifer Garner) is the over-protective mother of Brandy (Kaitlyn Dever). Don Truby (Adam Sandler) and Helen Truby (Rosemarie DeWitt) are parents struggling with two boys and internet porn. Allison Doss is struggling with body issues and anorexia. Kent Mooney (Dean Norris)'s son Tim (Ansel Elgort) quits football.It's all very sad and tiring. The cold narration from Emma Thompson does not help. Jason Reitman dresses up this jumble of Lifetime scary stories into a tapestry of modern isolation and sadness. I'm not invested in any of these characters. The whole movie leaves me cold and uncaring.
" Quite bland and not as Interesting
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,3,"Men, Women & Children is an ensemble film by director Jason Reitman. Although Adam Sandler gets top billing, this is not an ""Adam Sandler"" film. It's very much an ensemble and he is simply playing a character messed in with other characters. Sandler's character is an online addict who discovers scrambling through his teenage son's computer. Meanwhile, his wife (Rosemarie DeWitt) seeks extramarital spice online. Then there's a high school football star Tim (Ansel Elgort) who quits the game to focus on an online virtual game- Guild Wars, to the consternation of his dad (Dean Norris). The latter starts dating a photographer (Judy Greer) who fosters her teen daughter's Hollywood aspirations by posting sensitive photos of her online. Representing the opposite extreme, Jennifer Garner plays a mother who monitors her level-headed daughter's mobile devices.As a whole this film at first feels similar to a documentary then somewhat shifts and feels more like a television soap opera or dramatic mini-series split into several episodes. The running time of the film is almost 2 hours long, which is given since there are a lot of characters, and it's needed in giving them their proper screen time to develop any sense of plot. What doesn't work for this film, is the overall mood and tone of the film. It feels mostly very quiet, bland and depressing. The characters aren't too interesting or anything new (standard teen seeking relationships, parents not trusting teens, etc.) The film is more so of a journey and just feels by the end of the film, as if was it worth it. One can see why this film was a box office flop, as I barely recall it being distributed or promoted."
" Ambitious script that delivered and an amazing cast! Loved it!
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,10,"I was riveted by this movie that was able make the ""everyday"" profoundly dramatic. No small feat when a movie continually employs texts, online messages and characters staring at their devices. Normally this ""dead time"" would challenge the pacing and action but the subtext is so subtly built upon with tremendous acting that this movie achieves my expectations of a great drama. Not just tears... er, the roller-coaster of the character's journey but a mirror of the challenges many of us can relate to. In this case, it's life and love in this new digital age. The topic was explored with an unscathing hand so we felt the deep affects of everyday digital minutiae without even needing to explore the more extreme consequences of online interaction like cyber bullying, etc. It felt implied to me. Our worlds and our hearts are built on communication and the platform of that communication, shapes it."
