" A lot of biography, but little drama
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,5,"Movie is about the story of Jesse Owens, and his victory in Berlin Olympic Games, but it's too flat and doesn't excite as other sport films (Chariots of fire for example)"
" Race
",2020-10-28 00:00:00,5,"While the story of Jesse Owen is a well told one, what prevents it from being more than fine movie is the lack of psychology in the story.Why tell the story of jesse Owen if not to go in depth with what makes him tik, and what PUSHED him to become one of the greatest athletes in history.I alsoe belive there was a preminent lack of tension during most parts of the movie due to Jesse's dominance from the first time we are introduced to him."
" A very good story
",2020-09-27 00:00:00,8,"Based on the real life of Jesse Owens ""Race"" is a very good story about the life a black man of Cleveland, Jesse Owens, who will life very hard times: the racism of his universitary fellows, a moment of distraction with Quincell, doubts about his participation about the Olympic Games in Berlin.Also some executive of the U.S. Olympic have doubts: Germany will surely use these Olympic Games for its propaganda.We know what really happen.United States participated in these Olympic games and Lesse Owens showed that he is was the fastest man in the world.
The pérformances of Stephan James and Jason Sudeikis are excellent."
" Story
",2020-05-03 00:00:00,6,The movie shows the historical moments during the 1936 Olympics. An insteresting part of the recent story.
" Doesn't race enough to the finish
",2019-08-02 00:00:00,5,"Do have an appreciation for biopics and have done for a long time. Regardless of how true to the facts they are (often not for the sake of drama, which is nearly always the most common criticism of them) many are well made, well acted and interesting on their own terms with good intentions. Some of my personal favourites actually are biopics. Jesse Owens was a fascinating person with a fascinating story.Both Owens and his story, meaning his personal life, how he came to be what he became, the obstacles he had to overcome and what it was like at the time, were/are much more interesting than shown in 'Race' and both deserved better. Am not saying that 'Race' is a bad film, actually thought that it was well intended and did have its fair share of good qualities. It just could have done far more with its subject, being too conventional and it should have been more focused.'Race' looks great, the period detail is beautifully and evocatively recreated and the big races (which do thrill) and the first entrance into the Olympic stadium were strikingly and cleverly shot without being too showy so it doesn't become overblown. The CGI wasn't cheap and didn't jar, didn't even think it was that obvious but maybe that's just me. Rachel Portman's music score is unmistakably beautifully orchestrated, have always found Portman's compositional style distinctive and lovely to listen to, and a mix of subdued and with the right amount of intensity.The film is at its best in the relationship between Owens and Luz, Luz's admiration for Owens is never less than convincing, and in the entertaining interaction between Owens and Snyder. Actually also did like everything with Avery Brundage, the film does downplay what he was really like but his scenes did intrigue me and still found Brundage interesting. It also helps that the cast is a strong one. Stephan James does a great job as Owens, very commanding throughout and with much fire and emotion, and Jason Sudeikis surprisingly excels in a departure role for him. David Kross is admirable too and Carice Van Houten has fun as Liefenstahl, the best supporting turn though comes from Jeremy Irons, even when Brundage is written in a downplayed way Irons is still quite sinister at the same time.Did admire 'Race's' good intentions and also that it had a goal of making Owens and his story better known to younger generations.While saying that the cast was solid, there was an exception to me and that was Barnaby Metschurat, his Goebbels being too much of a caricature to bring any kind of chills. 'Race' does try to cover far too much with too many subplots, even in its pretty long running time too much of the film felt under-explored and somewhat bloated. The same problems apply with the script. Pacing is an issue too, with the film taking too long to get going and then becoming too rushed towards the end.For all Van Houten's efforts, personally didn't see any point to the Liefenstahl scenes when there is no real reason given for why they or she were there. They just felt like padding and should have featured less. Had more of a problem though with the Owens and Ruth storyline though, that was very underwritten and badly slowed the film down. It is the portrayal of the racism where 'Race' especially plays it too safe, it was much worse at the time than what is shown and instead of the ""trying hard not to offend"" approach there really should have been much more intensity and sinister edge to it. Got very little out of the Waldorf scene and that is not a good sign.Owens himself also felt underdeveloped, there was not near enough of what he was like as a person with there being more prominence on his importance and why. As well of course too much of the other subplots which distracted too much.All in all, not a bad film but could have been more. 5/10"
" An Honest Review
",2019-07-06 00:00:00,10,"Wow, Hopkins directed this and, honestly, at best he's directed a lot of guilty pleasure movies. You know, the movies that you know are bad but you like them anyway. This one is actually, well, good.It's a legit good film and that is odd for Hopkins.Anyway, the failing is the Nazi thing. The discrimination in America plays, because that was really the principal challenge that Owens needed to overcome to even make it to the Olympics in the first place. That was a struggle in and of itself.But, when it came to Germany it should have been more of a focus on him, and how he beat the ""master race"" and, instead, it was a little too focused on the Nazis. And, honestly, everyone knows who the Nazis are and what they did. We aren't watching the movie because of that, we are watching the movie because of what Owens did.However, despite that, the movie works with a strong opening act that dealt in an albeit heavy-handed but still absolutely dramatically compelling story about Owens. The only fault is that it loses focus in Germany."
" One of the Best Sport Bios Ever - Race
",2019-03-29 00:00:00,8,"Ive seen just about every sports film ever made; from Jim Thorpe, All-American with Burt Lancaster, to 42 and the Jackie Robinson story. This is one of the best; it ranks up there with Pride of the Yankees and Field of Dreams, among others. One odd thing about the film; it actually made you yearn for a proper treatment film on Lena Rifenstahl , the genius filmmaker who made Triumph of the Will (depicted in this film) and did the 36 Olympics better than any other Olympics was filmed before or after. This was just an added bonus subplot to a very good film, with great production values. It is interesting to note that FDR and the White House never made any mention of Owens' great victories. How odd that a progressive president (not to mention progressive First Lady) did not properly honor Owens. Great Sports Film."
" Race
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this movie because all the heart warming moments. It really caught my interest and how motivated// dedicated Jesse was to bettering himself. The end where he beats one of the best guys is a really good moment and I can imagine how amazing it'd feel to put in all this time and effort and being able to achieve that.I believe this movie best relation with history related is he was one man who was able to overcome many barriers in his own life. He wasn't only an outstanding althete he was as well an outstanding human being. Owens has set out good examples for people who wanna be like him and do the things he does, and it's amazing how many can look up to this one person for motivation and an influence."
" What a movie
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,9,"I've watched many a movie about how a person of color changes the world's definition of spectacular. RACE is no different. A movie about how Jesse Owens defies odds through racial discrimination and segregation. He participates in the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, Germany amid the conflicts leading up to World War II in Nazi Germany. Jesse wins four events in a single Olympics that year, proving that despite the color of his skin he's a natural runner and can do anything he wants to. Because the United States was still segregated during this time, it was harder for Jesse Owens to gain the respect of others around him. He was a man of color participating in a white man college. That wasn't something that usually happened during that time because of the racial discrimination. When asked about his name Jesse responds that his name is actually JC but a teacher pronounced it wrong and he didn't have the heart to correct her. A brilliantly made movie about how hard life can become. I liked that they didn't sugar coat things. They portrayed what life was like during the time."
" Race Has Two Meanings
",2019-01-08 00:00:00,9,"Race can mean a person´s ethnicity or a sport. This movie employs both meanings as the movie tells the story of Jesse Owens who wins multiple Gold medals in the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games. The movie stars Stephan James as Jesse Owens. The movie is both a sport movie and a history movie. The movie is really good and seems historically accurate. The conflict of the movie is that the Nazis are in power so the U.S. is hesitant to send athletes to Berlin. Many people agree that the 1936 Olympics should be called off. After some talking with one of the Nazi Leaders, the Olympics are held. Then much to the embarressment of the Nazis, Jesse Owens wins Gold in many of the track and field competitions. This movie is one of my favorites but i wish they had shown more of the other competing athletes. All in all this is an amazing movie and is one of the best movies about the Olympics."
" Race
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,6,I am watching this movie for a history though film class. The filmmaker is telling us how other countries treated each other. You could tell that they didn't get along while the war as going on. You could this movie was in the 1920's because the way the arenas looked. You could also tell by the way people dressed. Another way you could tell this movie was in the 1900's was by the way their running shoes looked. One thing that makes me question historical accuracy was how people got the races on the tv. The way people dressed is similar to other movies.Another thing that was similar was how their microphones looked. I liked how he didn't let what other people say about him bring him down. I also liked that he had good sportsman ship even when other people were being mean to him. I didn't like how the person running the olympics wouldn't meet him because of his race. I think this movie had a really good learning lesson with it. I think this was a good movie. Yes I would want to see movies by this director and these actors.
" history through film review
",2019-01-03 00:00:00,8,"I'm not a person who is interested in track and i thought this movie was gonna blow but it was actually pretty good. I think the history behind it is what makes it a memorable movie. The movie looks really good and i like the relationship that Jesse and his coach have throughout the movie. When you think about it if his coach wouldn't of been able to get on that boat with him to Germany, He might of choked and lost because he had no one for support. especially since this was before Hitler capped himself and was the leader of Germany. Back then the U.S was having racism problems too. So not only did he have to put up with the Nazis crap but he had do put up with white Americans crap also. This movie is definitely the typical heroes story but the director made it work with all the emotion and visuals he put into it. my favorite part is when all the Nazis get mad because Jesse Owens an African American man wins all the gold medals. Overall i give this movie a thumbs up and one day ill watch it again."
" SUPER GOOD
",2018-12-18 00:00:00,9,"This movie was super good. I really liked how it depicted racism in the time of Hitler. They did not like Jesse because of his race. When he competed for college it seemed as if the judges of the race did not want him to win. He then became very popular because of how good of a racer he was and you didn't see as much discrimination as before. The whole ordeal with Hitler ignoring his existence after he won a gold medal was pretty ridiculous. At this time everyone didn't know how bad of a person Hitler was, he was viewed as a great leader and idol. He was invited to the olympics to shake the hands of the gold medal winners. But, when Jesse came up to shake his hand, he wouldn't even look his way. This movie was very interesting and if I hadn't watched it for my history through film class, I might have watched it on my own."
" Lacks punch and excitement.
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,5,"The incredible story of Jesse Owens, translates into a movie with reasonable success. Worth watching for many compelling facts and aspects to the 'Berlin Games' of 1936; which includes the German (female) film maker, who defies Goebbels and films Owens winning the 200 meters. Obvious debate though on some of the so called ""truths"" about the Berlin Games."
" The Race Was On.
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,7,"Race is a retelling about the story of famous athlete Jesse Owens who is trying to become the best athlete so he can support his family and make a new one with his soon to be wife, and trying to figure if or not he should take place in the Olympics with all the discrimination with the Nazi regime.As this movie portrays how Jesse is natural and outstanding and how he proved regardless of race that people can get along and still stride in the achievements together. As I myself don´t watch many movie so i can´t say if or what are the best movies to describe that time period but i fell that this movie has Good representation of Jesse Owens story.As Stephen Hopkins did a good representation of this story as i haven´t seen any of his other movie but it is getting me interested in the other movie that he has made. But the actors did a fantastic job portraying the characters in the story as Stephan James(Jesse Owens) did a great job showing the emotions and thought that Jesse Would of thought of that time but The best part of acting Is that of Jason Sudeikis and Stephan James in scenes together as it show the confection that those have in student teacher relationship and showing how they went from complete Strangers to being Friends.Overall i would recommend this movie who want to know more about the Olympics during 1936 and the extreme prejudice that people had because of their race or ethnicity and it a good solid recreation of Jesse Owens Story."
" A Ohio State running coach yelling 24/7
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,8,"The stadium is full, thousands of people cheering excitedly. Jesse Owens (Stephen James) takes his mark on the line. As he stances up, the crowd's cheering voice diminishes till all you can hear is his breathing and beating heart. For those few seconds, everything is absolutely still. BANG ! The gun is shot and the runners take off in the 100 meter dash at the 1936 Olympic games.
""Race"" is a historical drama taking place in the 1930's telling the story of African-American college and Olympic track athlete Jesse Owens. He starts running faster and faster at competitions with his team from Ohio State University. His coach Larry Snyder (Jason Sudeikis) gets him training harder and harder, till he qualifies to go to the 1936 Olympic Games being held in Berlin, Germany. He goes to Berlin and takes home 4 gold medals and sets a new world record for the 100 meter dash at 10.3 seconds.
While the historical aspect of this movie is good, I don't exactly have a huge interest in the field. The history and time period the movie is set in is pre-World War 2. At this point in history, Adolf Hitler was elected as Chancellor of Germany just one year prior to the Berlin games resulting in the rise of the Nazi party. This made it incredibly risky for Owens to even attend the games, along with a close friend and 2 other athletes who were Jewish.
""Race"" is directed by Stephen Hopkins and I have never seen any movies done by him. Ever. That being said, with his vision for this film and the combination of the actors, the whole atmosphere of the film all coming together, it makes it a very pleasant experience.
Overall, this film isn't bad, but not top of my watch list. It does have it's good areas such as when he becomes good friends with Carl Long (David Kross). Even with all the good areas, it still has its rough spots. When he pulls his love life back together, he rushes back into the normal again pretty fast. Dumps his hoey girlfriend on the road and goes back for his Ruth (Shanice Banton). She seems to forgive him really quickly and all in in all, it seemed rushed too much. Closing up, the movie is good. It portrays the story it intended to tell and nothing else. My friends can watch it if they want, though they may think i'm their history teacher instead of their friend."
" ""Race"" for Equality
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,8,"This movie is very relate able to me because I also played sports. The scene where Jesse Owens (Stephan James) learns how to zone out the haters from his coach (Jason Studeikis) was a really good addition to the movie. The plot of this story consists of a black athlete who attends Ohio State track and field team and goes on to win many gold medals in the Olympics. Since we already know Jesse Owens will be successful because why else would they make a movie on him, I expected the movie to be predictable. But they actually did a very good job at making this movie suspenseful. This movie is an accurate representation of racism and the struggle of African American to this day. I liked how the movie showed some white people stand up against racism. Often today, people assume all white people supported racism against blacks. I did not like the end of the movie because I felt like it didn't show the shock on the people Jesse Owens proved wrong. But, overall this is very good movie. I recommend this movie for any athletes who feel they need some motivation."
" Thoughts on ""Race""
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,8,"This was a very entertaining movie. The reason being is that it has a good main story. Which reminded me of doing track in my old school though I wasn't the fastest i really enjoyed it Young black male named Jesse Owens (Stephen James) and Larry Snyder (Jason Sudeikis) Who are student and coach who go through many ups and downs like racism and being cheated on the track, but Jesse had something to prove to everyone. I never knew the story of Jesse Owens or his struggles. Some of which were financial and family related. This movie to me was done great based on the years it really happened and reminds me of many problems sports had in these couple years like the debate of which you can kneel during the National Anthem. Though I have heard of some movies from Stephen Hopkins, This is the first film that i have seen from him, I have seen Jason Sudeikis in other films like Hall Pass but this doesn't remind me of why i like him as an actor this film brought out the more emotional and serious sides of the characters he has played. Which I believe was one of his better roles that he has done. The main thing I did not like about this movie was the short length of the track meets and how fast they went through them. If I new about this movie sooner i would've been watching this movie pretty often with friends and family, I really enjoyed the movie and connected to it in a way, of his struggles and devotion to prove people wrong"
" inspirational
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,10,"I really enjoyed this movie. i Watched it for the second time in my history through film class. I find this movie very inspirational and heartwarming, I used to run Track and field and he was an inspiration to me.In the movie when the races were about to start, and the official would say runners take you mark... it would make my heart beat faster because i can sympathize that feeling.
This movie shows that You can succeed anything If you work hard at it. I found it very interesting how the director made it suspenseful, Like the part when Jesse was thinking about not going to Berlin. Before the movie even started we all knew that Jesse was going to Berlin and compete. Overall i really enjoyed How it was filmed and the historical accuracy. Jesse Owens is one of my favorite athletes of all time, in my opinion he is better than Usain bolt."
" HaHa
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,10,I have already watched this movie in my history through film class last year .The movie this filmmaker is doing is about a young man from the time of people still being very racist went to the olympics to support his country.I already knew that JC would cheat on his wife Ruth with Quincella and that he would go back to ruth after realising that he really did not love Quincella. The director is Stephen Hopkins i have never seen any of the movie he's made except Race.I liked how when Jc came to his senses and went to the olympics. This movie is a really good and if you like movies where they run then you will like this.
" Luz and Jesse were better friends than Troy Bolton and Chad Danforth
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,9,"""Race"" is a feel good type of movie. I love the story of Jesse Owens and his historical races at the Berlin Olympics, which is also a historical moment on it's own. The Berlin Olympics hosted Louis Zamperini (a WWII bomber who has an amazing survival story) as well as took place right before WWII and was overseen by Hitler himself (gross). Jesse Owens finds his talent in running and despite being a black man, works his way towards the top at his Ohio University. His coach (Coach Snyder) immediately sees his potential and takes interest in him, training him to be the best athlete possible and encourages him to go to Berlin to compete in the Olympics. After many struggles, setbacks and inner conflict within Jesse, he makes it to Berlin and competes in 3 planned events and one last minute event, sprung on him the day of, due to the discrimination against his Jewish teammates by the German government who were no longer permitted to compete. Jesse ended up taking home 4 gold medals from his events. My favorite part of the movie was the support Jesse earned from Luz, a German competitor in the long jump. Even though Jesse beat him, Luz celebrated right along with him after his victory. There is no part in this movie I didn't enjoy (aside from Hitler and the Nazi's of course) because it was a really well executed storyline. The filming was pretty substantial and there were no weird soundtracks in this movie, which I've come to start noticing after the previous movies we've watched in history through film (you know who you are). I've started reading the book Unbroken about Louis Zamperini and although they went to the same Olympics, they're stories aren't very similar."
" Yes, I watch the movie. ""Why didn't you tell me?"" You never asked.
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,9,"I enjoyed the film presented to me during my class. I would have never thought to watch it outside of class but it is something I'd be willing to watch again because the over all plot was about an oppressed runner who fights for his family, civil rights finds a way to jump over all of the walls place on the track. Jesse(JC) Owens is an Olympic runner who brought home four gold metals in the year 1963; which was hosted by the Germans while Hitler was in charge but not yet doing concentration camps. The historical accuracy of the film is questionable because of the treatment Jesse(JC) Owens by his coach, while being treated equally from him is a main focus. The coach trained him with same energy and focus at the others in the show but the coach standing up for him in different situations due to his race is unclear. If true it showed the coach understanding and listening to others then other white people. This brings great strides in the racial differences showing we are all human and deserve to be treated no differently due to idiotic ideals. This movie brings great inspiration for the future and equality, we can just hope the people who watch this make a huge difference and break through the past. Jesse, JC, Mr.Owens, you are a grand role model for our future, more people and situations should be recogonized."
" Is the movie called race because of his race or because he races?
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,8,"I have watched this movie in the past at the movie theater. This movie still gives me the same experience I got when I first watched it. This was a very good film, it has been the best movie we have watched in class. Jesse Owens(Stephen James) is a black track runner. That grew up in New York, he went to college at Ohio state which is dominantly white state. Jesse Owens grew up with racial tension throughout his whole life. Jesse Owens has the chance to go to the Olympics in Berlin in 1936. He decision is very undecided because of Berlin and how he wouldn't be accepted there. I knew that there was the Berlin Olympics but i did not know that Hitler had attended the Olympics. He was supposed to shake everybody's hands that got a gold medal but did not. I can say that i knew there was a Berlin Olympics. Stephen Hopkins was the filmmaker of this movie. Stephen James was the main character that played Jesse Owens. Larry Snyder played the coach in the movie. I liked the movie in general it was very fascinating to watch and learn about that time period. It showed what the time period was like to the people that weren't white. I have watched this movie outside of school i watched it when it came out in theaters. I would recommend this movie to a friend."
" Owens with a world record of four gold metals
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,7,Owens was an independent gold digger. He worked hard and managed to get more gold than any of the other racers. The filmmaker is telling the story of JC Owens. How he broke through barriers and made it to the Olympics in Germany. Yes the history part is interesting to me. It shows how even when the odds are against Owens he still tries his hardest despite being discriminated against. Something that made me question the accuracy is how friendly people were to JC and his friend. I think there would've been more hatred than there already was. The director was Stephen Hopkins. Some of the main actors in Race were Stephan James and Jason Sudeikis. While i haven't seen James in any other movie i have seen Sudeiks and I do consider him to be a good actor. I also enjoy the movies he's in. I liked when I noticed the Nazi propaganda lady from Game of Thrones. I probably wouldn't have watched this alone unless it was the only decent movie on. This is a good movie but i don't think it's good enough to recommend. Overall the movie was good and showed how Ownes broke records and barriers but it was a bit boring at some parts.
" History Through a Discarded Lens.
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,10,"""Race"" finds itself to be a prominent example within the vast spectrum of movies focused on civil right's movements. Director Stephen Hopkins finds a great blend of both entertainment and breathtaking sequences that kept me on the edge of my feet during every single race.Jesse Owens (Played by Stephan James) is the renowned protagonist within the film, and the plot essentially follows his journey to the 1936 Olympics, and the political struggles of it being held by the Nazi regime. It should be noted, however, that this film greatly expands on his life more than any history book. Due to the discrimination at the time this film is based, (1933-1936) Owens was rarely recognized for his accomplishments at home, with the U.S. Government not once acknowledging his outstanding 3 gold medal wins. ""Race"" finds a way to tell people his story, however, and does it in a way that leaves you unable to look away from the screen.There's is no movie that is quite as impactful as ""Race"" either. Sure, there are several films that tackle the same issue as described within history, but there are very few that are capable of immersing you into the past with great sequences that should be nothing less than revered in the film industry.""Race"" provides an element that just about anybody can enjoy. With award-winning performances and sound designs, Race is nothing less than an amazing experiences, and that is exactly why I decided to give it a well-deserved 10/10. This film will provide you with the historical context of the situation while still maintaining the kind of entertainment that many pieces fail to provide, and is a movie that, like the accomplishments of Jesse Owens, should be remembered for decades to come."
" I Am Writing This Review For My History Class
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,9,I loved the scene where USA held hands with Germany at the Olympics. It made me feel like Germany wasn't just a whole bunch of bad people. This film is about a black man that does track. He makes it to the Olympics even though there is a lot racial tension in the U.S. and Germany. Even though people don't want him to go he goes and wins 4 gold medals. I liked the time period this was in. I am very interested in learning more about this and what happened to all of these people. Even though this was 80 years ago there is still some racial tension in the world today. People are still struggling to enjoy life in some countries. Stephen Hopkins did a very good job in making film. He did a good job portraying the racial tension at the Olympics. I liked the parts when he was racing. It really showed that he was so good at what he did.
" Americans prevail
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,9,The film was very inspiring and gave me goosebumps when German racer and Jesse Owens played by Stephen James took each others hand and took a victory lap. IT showed two different people from totally different backgrounds join and show the world a new side to racism. I knew that Hitler was not happy about race and didn't like anything race besides hi own. He had many people killed just because of certain beliefs. The movie was set before he took any real actions but everybody knew his intentions. My favorite scene was mentioned earlier and I think it really shaped the movie and it is what I took out of it. I really liked the actors they did a good job portraying these events because it must have been really hard in real life. They showed the emotion that was needed to make the film complete. The movie overall was one of the best historical films I have seen and would love to see again.
" RACE
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,7,"In the movie ""Race"" there was a scene where Jesse Owens gets hurt trying to show off. I felt that hard because I did that once in my football game. The movie is about inspiriting people to follow their dreams, no matter what type of race you are. The filmmaker is telling us that there will always be people that will love you or hate you but that don't matter because you only need to focus on yourself and do good. The filmmaker is also telling us to not give up on your dream or any goal you are trying to achieve even if you are not the same race because at the end there is only one race and it's the human race. My favorite scene of the movie is when Luz helps out Jesse because it shows that not all the people are the same. It made the film better by showing us that we can come together as one and make something better. I liked how Jesse gets a piece of his daughter's hair and puts it in his necklace for motivation. Because it reminds me of me when I went to Vegas and played but my baby couldn't come so I took a picture of her and took it with me. I don't like how that German commander told the people to not record the race because he knew they was not going to win."
" Review
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this movie and the inspiration that comes with it. I really liked the scene where the German racer told him to take his last jump and he broke the record. It shows great sportsmanship for him holding up his arm as he wins. It is something we can all learn from. We can all learn to be good sports and to not judge someone no matter how they look. I think the history is interesting because I didn't know that Hitler was in charge and there would still be olympic events. That was the only thing that I had questioned. Although I don' t know anyone who was in or help make this movie, I really liked the ending scene because it's such a big topic that we as a society need to learn to do. I liked the story that the movie tried to get across and I would definetely recommend this movie to others."
" Race
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,8,"The Race was a great movie and shows how people can overcome doubts. The movie Race is story of a man named Jesse Owens, he was an Olympic runner for the United States. He goes through many trials deciding whether or not he wants to compete for the gold medals. This part of history was really interesting to me. I actually enjoy learning about the era of Nazis. The director to this movie is Stephen Hopkins, I think he did a good job on showing the very important parts of the film. I have not seen any other movies by this director but I have heard of some. The movie did a good job on showing the success of Jesse Owens and I really liked that. This is a movie that I would show one of my friends and recommend to watch. Overall I thought this movie was a great watch and is one of the better history films I have seen."

",2018-12-14 00:00:00,8,"This is a very inspirational movie. it has many good seen's in the movie, on of my favorite seen's is where Luz comes to help jesse on where to jump from. I knew about the Germans starting to clean thou country of Jewish folk but i didnt know that the held the Olympics in Germany of the time being. I liked how they actually used the nazi signs to make it more accurate especially with how everyone gets offended about it now. I dont think this is a movie i would have watched outside of school but after watching it in class i would more than likely watch this movie again."
" Race Review
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,8,"This movie had some great scenes. I liked the scene where Jesse Owens begins training for the Olympics. The plot is that Jesse Owens starts college and gets good enough at running to the point where he qualifies for the Olympics. He is pressured greatly to win in order to prove America is better than the Nazis. During this point in time, Hitler has just recently taken power in Germany and become the dictator. He has started taking away rights of the Jews. My favorite scene is where Jesse sees all the gold medals he earned. I thought the movie was great and it'd be nice to see others like it."
" Race review
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,10,The race had a very interesting beginning that included the times were segregation was still in place. I myself have made a lot of connections to this movie just by how everything was. For example the way the brothers had to sit in the back of the bus reminded me of the Rosa Parks situation as well as Martin Luther kings out comes from his situations. The plot of the story overall was a colored man running track breaking records wanting to fulfill his dreams as an Olympic track runner. Many obstacles were thrown at him during this time that included race and religious beliefs. Jesse the main character handled and performed everything perfect which made him the runner that he was during that time. Overall this movie had a powerful message that any colored or anyone with religious beliefs should watch and know that our talents have no limit no matter color.
" Worth watching, but long
",2018-05-30 00:00:00,7,"The name Jesse Owens is less well known in the 21st century than it once was. But there was a time when Owens was one of the best-known men in Europe and the USA: he was the fastest man in the world, the winner of 4 gold medals at the 1936 Olympics. This film (the winner of my personal competition for best Film Title Around At The Moment for its simple but clever pun) tells his story, particularly his rise in US athletics under the tutelage of coach Larry Snyder and, later, the - how can one put it? - difficulties associated with the 1936 Olympics.The film puts together an interesting story, some good performances, and an excellent realisation of time and location - small-town America in the 20s and 30s and contemporary sports arenas (most of which are almost certainly gone now) and the Berlin locations - they are all brought to the screen courtesy of a mixture of actual locations and CGI, the latter of which only really shows in aerial shots.The performances are nearly all good. Stephan James is perhaps a little over-earnest as Owens, but it is a performance of sincerity and honesty. Jeremy Irons as Olympics bigwig Avery Brundage is tripped up by his American accent (again: see also Appaloosa), and Barnaby Metschurat plays Nazi minister Joseph Goebbels like a twilight vampire. But Carice van Houten (a personal favourite) makes quirky filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl interesting and likeable, and Jason Sudeikis as coach Snyder, the first non-comedy role I have seen him in, is very good.The anti-semitism and racism in Nazi Germany is, as expected, clear, but it is also understated and all the more powerful for that. What is less expected, because things have moved on so much in the interim, is the racism in the USA. Owens' success meant that he found favour because of his celebrity, but there is a very effective and sobering coda just before the closing titles roll.I don't always find ""worthy"" films all that entertaining - the worthiness sometimes overpowers any entertainment value - but this movie fully engaged me throughout its two and a quarter hours."
" I know you can run. Can you win?
",2018-01-15 00:00:00,8,"This is the Jesse Owens (Stephen James) story starting in Cleveland as he bids farewell to his baby mamma and child as he heads off to Ohio State. It ends in Berlin.What I enjoyed best was Leni Riefenstahl (Carice van Houten) who was instructed by Hitler to film the 1936 Olympics and did so in spite of Herr Gobbels (Barnaby Metschurat). While the film has the expected feel good chest swell due to the subject matter, I never was able to connect to the main character. While some say Stephan James ""nailed it"" and that may be true, I didn't feel all the issues he had to face, perhaps because he was accepted them quietly and timing his outbursts.No swearing sex, or nudity. Did people use ""hell"" on the radio, and did they say ""good luck with that?"" BTW Germany got the most medals in the 1936 Olympics."
" Never reaching its full potential
",2017-12-14 00:00:00,7,"The 11th feature film by director Stephen Hopkins, ""Race"" (2016) tells the inspiring and fascinating story of Jesse Owens' way to making athletics history at the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The story has great potential, but fails in reaching the highest levels./Mårten Larsson (Twitter: @7thArtShortReviews)."
" an Olympic hero
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,8,"""Race"" from 2016, is the story of Jesse Owens and his competing in the 1936 Olympics. The title of course has the double meaning of the challenges Owens met as a black man and the fact that he was a runner. Jesse Owens (Stephan James) becomes a star in track while in college. It was great news for his college, which was on a losing streak and for his coach, Larry Snyder (Jason Sudeikis). Owens even breaks a record during a college championship. The film shows the prejudice and bullying blacks in college faced, as well as displays of prejudice on the team. It's a sad statement - sadder yet because in subtler ways, as we know, it continues. A huge debate was taking place among members of the U.S. Olympic Committee about whether the United States should agree to compete in the Olympics. There are two factions - Avery Brundage (Jeremy Irons), the President of the committee, who has his doubts about the rumors about what is going on in Germany, and Judge Jeremiah T. Mahoney (William Hurt) who is opposed to sending athletes. It is decided that by Brundage, will go to Berlin and assess the situation. He receives a promise that there will be no discrimination during the games.This is an important part of the film and also seems to be a touch inaccurate. Though Brundage agreed to allow two Jewish runners to be cut from the team right before they were to compete, it was not for the reason given in the film. Brundage was actually not a very nice guy. He felt the worst thing in the world was Communism and admired how Germany had come back to power under Hitler and was probably a racist himself. Meanwhile, Jesse was under pressure from the NAACP not to attend.But Jesse goes and wins four medals, to the consternation of Goebbels and Hitler. A big deal was made, then and now, with the fact that Hitler did not shake Owens' hand, although Owens claimed that he did, in front of witnesses, behind the stadium, and Jesse had a photo of it. This hasn't been proved, but it is true that FDR never invited him to the White House, never congratulated him or even sent him a telegram.Owens' victory was a hollow one - he was barred from amateur athletic competition and his promised endorsements dried up. Eventually his life did come together when he was made goodwill ambassador by the government. He remained married to Ruth (Shanice Banton), and they had three daughters together.Two wonderful parts of the film: Owens entering the Olympic field in front of a massive audience, with the Hindenberg flying overhead. The scene really captured how overwhelming it must have been. The other wonderful element was Owens' friendship with fellow German competitor Luz Long, who advised him at one point. Though the film shows a scene of the two getting together and talking during the Olympics, that didn't happen. The two men corresponded and were friends until Long was killed in the war, after which Owens was in touch with his family and grew close to his children.Highly recommended - it's an inspiring film, well acted and directed, in large part true, and one of those triumph of the human spirit stories - which today, we need more than ever."
" Could've been great but... ugh
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,6,"I enjoyed this movie but there are a few problems I have with it.I wish they wouldn't have tried to include so many scenes that are meant to explain the history of Nazi Germany and the controversy with the Berlin Olympics. There are scenes that take us far from Jesse and Ohio State track team into conferences with the international Olympic committee and meetings with German diplomats. I personally think that the history of the German Nazi Olympics is knowledge that most people are at least mildly aware of, but even if an audience knows nothing about it, you can tell a story that makes it clear without literally having to show the Olympic meetings. A story about Jesse Owens is a story about Jesse Owens. There are far too many and too long scenes that have nothing to do with him personally.The other major problem I have is the accents. Jesse's accent changes constantly. It goes from general rural African American accent to 2016 Stephan James. Larry Snyder only ever sounds like 2016 Jason Sudekis. It's not right for the place nor the time. It distracts from the movie because all I can hear is funny guy SNL Jason. The acting isn't phenomenal. There's a lot of unnatural dialogue moments. Far too many. But it's not terribly awful. Just awkward and a bit distracting. Historical inaccuracies are a major complaint I see, and while I can understand that, I personally didn't find them to be obviously distracting (aside from Jason sounding like he's doing an SNL skit instead of even attempting any accent.) All other characters accents are random as well. Sometimes they fit, other times the don't. Sometimes it seems like they intentionally wanted to neutralize accents. Overall it's just kinda meh. It's better than average, but they didn't do Jesse justice in forming an emotional connection with him. He's presented in a meh way. You're rooting for him of course but you're not really enthusiastic. i didn't form an emotional connection where I really cared about him. I wish they would've cut the diplomat meeting scenes and used that time to give us more backstory and emotion for Jesse. Disappointing. Could've been great but it just didn't meet my expectation."
" Expected, Professional, Solid, Safe For Everyone
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,8,"(Flash Review)The movie kicks off with the story of Jesse Owen as he started his collegiate career at Ohio State through the 1936 Olympics. It touched on his training as well as discrimination not only from his race but parallels with Germany and their abuse of Jews. Littered with many cliché moments, there is also some very well produced scenes and sets and one great single shot from when Owen's enters the Olympic stadium to him taking his marks and the race completion; not cuts and complimented with a good musical score. Overall it is an entertaining and quality produced Hollywood period piece even though it doesn't dive too deep into the racial topics."
" A really bad propaganda attempt
",2017-06-04 00:00:00,1,"Rewriting historical facts and twisting them for leftist propaganda purposes, this biased crap would make Jesse Owens rolling in his grave, as he was better treated in Nazi Germany than in the US. Adolf Hitler treated Jesse Owens better than his own President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) and that shameful fact is one that CANNOT change no matter how many money are invested into brainwashing people with shitty movies like this and will always be there to haunt the US and leftists worldwide."
" Movie was okay, racist but not the way you think.
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,3,"Isn't it funny how black people keep screaming about racism but in the movie Owens says ""china man"" even though the athlete is Japanese? I grew up with black people being more racist than any white man. Its only racist if it happens to blacks or hispanics in this country. Otherwise I do like watching movies based on historical facts."
" Tries to include too much
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,7,"Race, a film about the legendary Olympian Jesse Owens, is a story that deserves a good biopic. Owens means more to me for what his achievement meant to politics than as an athlete; ""Race"" is an obviously perfect title for concisely referring to both. The film itself is competently done in many of its technical aspects, although the way the names of places are paraded on screen when the story switches settings is tacky, at best. James gives a good performance; much of the film's handling of his story is well done.The problem is that the film attempts to include too much. There's not much reason why this needed to go above the two-hour mark. We see a lot of scenes where Owens isn't present, and many of these don't need to be here. He don't need a story about the general history of Nazi Germany; we don't need to see the conflicts between Goebbels and his film director; we don't even need to see as much as what we saw about the debate as to whether the US should boycott the Olympics. Immaterial, and trimming can heighten impact. I was half- expecting we'd get a scene depicting Hitler committing suicide in his bunker. Still, on the whole, Race, as a story about Owens, makes a nice statement."
" Oh I see what you did there
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,8,"Race, the final Frontier ... no wait, that is something completely different. But if there ever was a more apt title than this, is something I can not answer. Right at this moment, none other come to mind that have that double meaning (some might say pun). Yes it is about racing, but it's also about race (also skin color to be more accurate).This being based on true events and actual persons, has a tough task. But it pulls it off. And maybe if it played later in cinemas, it might have had a chance to be considered for an Oscar or two too. As it is, this is a gripping story of a man overcoming many odds to go to an Olympic Event. But is it the right thing to do? What I did like was the morality and the hard questions this did ask. Also the fact that it did paint a broader picture than your average movie. It's still not perfect, but it's still more than solid"
" Good Movie but could have been better
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Firstly there are a lot of good things about this movie. First, it is a story that needed to be told. Jessie Owens was one of the greatest athletes of all time, yet because he was black his achievements did not give him the rewards it should have. Had he been white he would have been set for life. Sadly this shows what a racist country America is, despite their dictating to other countries such as Nazi Germany and South Africa, America has always practised extreme racism and segregation, especially in the South. The fact that the President did not have Jessie in the White house but entertained the other athletes speaks volumes. Although this is hinted at in the movie, especially near the end when Jessie and his wife have to use the trade entrance to a hotel where they were holding an event in HIS honour, I felt that this could have been shown more in the movie. The racism of red neck type footballers in university was not enough. The other thing that irritated me was the way Jessie's white coach was featured as being almost responsible for how good Jessie was. How true there relationship was is not clear, but him making sure Jessie did not have to work to pay for his college fees was made up. Stephan James does a good job in the title role but looks very little like the real man. Shanice Banton as his understanding wife was very good and stole every scene she was in.So over all a good movie, still worth watching that could have been more hard hitting and accurate."
