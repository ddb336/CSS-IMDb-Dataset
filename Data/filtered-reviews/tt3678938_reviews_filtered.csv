" Same old love story
",2020-10-29 00:00:00,3,If you want to watch sommething new this is not your go-to film.
" Trash
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,1,"If you want to waste your time watch this movie. The characters are unfunny and unloving, with a boring story and tacky songs. Humor is extremely forced and cringe."
" Melodrama, stupid cliches and some good things
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,4,"I saw the whole things in two parts, 5 years apart, so that tells about all the excitement I had for the movie, but I did completed it.There is a very predictable story that follows DDLJ path, but with everything replaced by a much worse version. From Amrish Puri, we are now left with some guy who I've not seen anywhere else, and SRK is replaced by Varun Dhawan, who didn't look natural most of the time and some creepy dialogues were added as well.The only good thing or like for like replacement was Alia Bhatt, she lives the character and looks so pretty that I withstood everything else. Still no match for Simran, but it was something else.All in all, it was decent only due to some cute moments, but a lot of cringy ones."
" Songs are really G00D
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,5,Story is not all good but songs are best......................

" Very mediocre
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,4,"Except for good chemistry between Alia and Varun, nothing much going on this movie."
" Short review
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,4,"This movie doesnt have anything new in store, just the same old story. The only thing I found new and refreshing was varun dhawans acting and the wonderful chemistry between alia and him. Watch if u want to see the same old story enacted by a different set of actors.
Overall below average"
