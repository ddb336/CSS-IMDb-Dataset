" Hard pass on this one...
",2021-03-18 00:00:00,1,"Correct movie title should be ""I Am Turd""... In vinney barbarino voice ""oh ma Gawd"" this movie sucked. I think I'm done with travolta movies... I don't get why he makes turds like this. Just a waste and doesn't do his career any justice. Maybe he wants another airplane or something I don't know. What I do know is the movie was painful to watch. Almost as bad as trying to crap out a knotted up rope... like I said, warm moist turd that you just can't wipe away no matter hard hard you try. Next"
" What about the babysitter???
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,8,"Overlooking the henious crime that is Travolta's hair-piece, this is actually an engrossing well-paced and action-filled movie with great performances in the key roles.
*Spoiler*
What doesn't sit right is that the babysitter gets shot, which is shocking yet gets no further attention in the story thereafter. It's basically ignored."
" ""I Am Wrath"" - Formulaic Movie.
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,6,"From IMDB: ""Stanley Hill opens a can of brutal vengeance on the thugs who murdered his wife and the corrupt cops who are protecting them.""Stars: John Travolta, Christopher Meloni, Amanda Schull.In a nutshell, this is a buddy movie between Chris and John, who served together in Black Op's - way back when. So they are pretty good with guns.
Throw in shades of Death Wish, crooked cops and corrupt Politicians,
and you get the idea.Travolta's wife is killed, seemingly at random; however later on John finds
out the real reason and goes on the rampage, ably backed up by Meloni.
The 'ending' may surprise you.Not bad, not original, but worth 90 mins of your time."
" Decent
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,6,"Not bad story. It did draw out a little, but a nice one off vengeance movie, would recommend."
" Cheesey
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,3,"An unsuccessful blend of revenge flick like Deathwish or The Exterminator and cop buddy movie. Bad dialogue, a telegraphed plot and pure cheese all the way to the forgone conclusion. The only redeeming factor was Christopher Meloni. I gave it 3 out of 10."
" Cliché Story, but Highly Entertaining
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,7,"When the manager of Honda vehicles Stanley Hill (John Travolta) returns to Columbus, Ohio, he is welcomed by his beloved wife Vivian (Rebecca De Mornay) at the airport. Vivian is an advisor of Governor Merserve (Patrick St. Esprit), who has reduced the crime rate in Ohio, and now she is analyzing the environmental effect of a duct of oil in Columbus. When they are at the parking lot, they are approached by three scumbags that kill Vivian. Stan identifies one of the thugs to Det. Gibson (Sam Trammell) and Det. Walker (Asante Jones), but they release the criminal telling that they do not have enough evidence to keep him locked up. But Stan is a former CIA operative and he seeks out his former partner Dennis (Christopher Melon) to find justice to Vivian. Soon they find a network of corruption in very high level and Stan decides to eliminate the problem.""I Am Wrath"" is a film of revenge in the style of the franchise ""Death Wish"", with John Travolta in the lead role with Christopher ""SVU"" Meloni as his partner. The result is a highly entertaining film that professional critics will certainly hate. But fans of a good action movie will enjoy and have a goodtime watching this film. Last but not the least, it is impressive how Rebecca De Mornay is still a very beautiful woman. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Eu Sou a Fúria"" (""I Am the Wrath"")"
" Could not hang
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,2,"The movie was as bad as the toupee Travolta was wearing. I truly wanted to like the movie, but you can only think who are they kidding so many times. I could not finish it."
" Travolta
",2020-10-20 00:00:00,9,I thought John Travolta and Christopher meloni were excellent in this film. Despite the lower ratings I highly recommend this film..
" Chuck Russell, aka director wouldn't know a handgun from his patookas.
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,5,"At about 30:30 Travolta has a gun to a guys throat. He gets ticked and sits up, jacks a round into his automatic pistol and threatens the guy again?????? He's just using this for ""stupid license"" aka ""nothingness"". Anyone who has ever carried a weapon knows two things. You don't leave home without a round in the chamber, and you don't ever have to ""jack"" a round in the chamber if it was needed 10 minutes ago. It may look ""neat"" to someone who has no knowledge of guns, like Russell, but it REALLY, REALLY, REALLY, ruins the scene for the rest of us who just want to be entertained."
" He's out of retirement....with a vengeance
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,4,Another hackneyed revenge flick with little to no character development and lots of lazy action sequences that were dulled down to keep the rating that allows older teenagers to learn that people die instantly when they're stabbed....but they don't bleed....Just.... enough alreadyPlease
" Highly disappointed
",2020-10-05 00:00:00,2,"The first 15mn were surprisingly decent. Travolta's acting was even ok. I really could imagine myself, desperate after what happened to him. I was wondering ""What would I do?""Then it is revealed that the husband is OF COURSE a former spec ops military whatever, who hides an arsenal in his closet. We've seen it a thousand times. Taken, Equalizer, John Wick, Law abiding citizen, Death wish...etc. Come on...I would have so much prefered if the guy was just an average Joe, having to find an untracable gun, find the killer's whereabouts...etc. It would have been much more relatable. Now it's just a bootleg John Wick.Very disappointing."
" Decent revenge thriller.
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,7,Entertaining action revenge with lots of comedic elements. Starts off realistic then gets a bit over the top towards the end. Lots of fights with some decent hand on hand combat. Worth it if you are after some general thrills.Remember to forget about logic towards the end and just have some fun!
" IMDB ratings are geting ridiculous
",2020-10-02 00:00:00,8,"This is a good film. What is wrong with people? From my eperience with a couple wrong film reviews, I now find it hard to equate low film ratings as reality. Many films rated from 4,8 are good nowadays."
" earned all three stars
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,3,"Bad acting, bad screen play, same old story. You have to be really bored to watch this and I was LOL."
" Just a fun movie to watch
",2020-09-22 00:00:00,9,"I wish it was a TV series lol. I loved the 2 actors together, it was just fun to watch. I laughed throughout it. I don't know what everyone was expecting from this movie, for it to be a Die Hard? One negative, you can tell the difference between the seasoned actors and the new comers though. But overall a good movie."
" John Wick?
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,6,"No John Wick here , more like John WIG... that wig is super distracting!
Now about the movie... dont expect something special, its pretty much Ok. One thing for sure, never bored me a single minute."
" PERFECT ENDING LIKE A GOOD CARTOON
",2020-08-31 00:00:00,7,Not as bad as they say... Definitely not a serious A movie. But very entertaining nevertheless.
" Great action filled movie
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,10,"Action nonstop the whole movie is very satisfying to watch very eye catching and also with one of my favorite actors John Travolta is one of the main characters that plays in it, it is thrilled packed with a great ending"
" mediocre revenge movie, still ok to watch
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,6,"This is a typical revenge movie, nothing special, very predictable.
Action is good, but many boring moments.Travolta's face looks very artificial (too much plastic surgery, fillers, botox...), something about his hair is unnatural too.I feel sorry about the babysit being shot for doing nothing.Anyway, a solid 6/10"
" Similar to movie plots before involving revenge
",2020-06-23 00:00:00,7,I've seen this plot before in Hard To Kill Steven Seagal would be proud
" Not outstanding, but not terrible either.
",2020-06-20 00:00:00,6,"Middle of the road revenge flick with admittedly some issues. It's been done before, some of the dialogue is dumb, and the acting is not always top shelf. Travolta and Meloni are both good though, and have good chemistry together.
It has it's ups and downs, but watchable."
" Nice to watch a show without G.. D... in it
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,8,A decent movie without the use of Gods name in vain. A few curse words but a nice action movie.
" My opinion
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,8,"This movie is nothing new, we've seen these films a hundred times with different casts etc.. This one is really good tho. Travolta is great and plays the part well. The action is good and the plot moves along nicely. It probably won't be a movie you'll watch again and again but it's definitely good and definitely worth a watch."
" My word it's bad
",2020-05-27 00:00:00,1,The only thing worse than this movie is the toupee that Travolta wears.
" More like a comedy
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,3,"Oh my, what a load of drivel, if you actually watch this, the plot is so predictable that the Mrs was guessing the next lines and getting them correct."
" Remember this director
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,2,"Chuck Russel, I will remember this director so I never have to watch a movie directed by him again.. He clearly has no love for the genre and gives the actors nothing to work with. It's pretty painfull to watch."
" Shouldn't enjoy this, but I did.
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,8,"I started watching this, then got curious about the IMDB score, which turned out to be 5.4. There are two serious issues with this movie. The awful acting of the (shall we say) pimp, and Travolta's hair. Apart from that, this is a throw away piece of nonsense. Thoroughly enjoyable and not to be taken seriously. When you want a revenge flick, with a little humour, this is it. Well paced and absolutely bonkers."
" It's John!
",2020-05-12 00:00:00,7,"What's wrong with you miserable reviewers? Seriously, sit back, watch the movie again without critical eyeballs and say to yourself, is this OK, then say to yourself, is this OK because it's John Travolta? And if the answer is yes, then give the film a good rating! Simple. X"
" Better than expected
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,6,"The movie is simple, the plot is okay, the bad guys are very stereotypical - but I still enjoyed it very much. And Dennis (the sidekick) is a great character, especially compared to the other more forgettable characters. Good fun with some popcorn."
" Simple story, simply told
",2020-04-14 00:00:00,5,The storyboard is very simple. Interesting bridges are missing. The trailer in Amazon Prime Video is the complete summary of this movie.
" Solid Action Film !
",2020-03-14 00:00:00,7,"In years gone by, the Fabric of Society used to be more cohesive and could ""generally agree"" on this or that. But all of that is over with now. Everybody is so entitled & self important . They're looking for a film to be an emotional salvation to answer all their questions and full fill them in every way. Gimme a Break !!
Iam Wrath is a Solid Action/Crime Drama. Loved the chemistry between Meloni & Travolta !"
" Lighten up, Francis
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,8,"""I Am Wrath"" delivers the goods when it comes to a revenge thriller. Revenge movies are one of my favorite genres. They can be played in the old west or in modern times. The stories, if done well, can really wrap you up in situation. ""I Am Wrath"" does just that. I was all in from the get go. The cast is very good, especially Christopher Meloni. Meloni could have stolen this movie from John Travolta if he wanted to. He's great. ""I Am Wrath"" may take a plot turn that I wasn't expecting but by that point there was no turning back for me. When you make a genre movie you have to play within the lines. All the great ones do. ""I Am Wrath"" isn't one of the great ones but it's a good one. I really want there to be a sequel. Travolta and Meloni make a very enjoyable team."
" Sad, sad, sad!
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,1,Such bad acting...Rebecca deMornay is mutton dressed up as lamb. She's had so many face lifts she's unrecognisable. And what's with the wig Travolta was wearing. As I said in the beginning bad acting all round!
" ""But I am full of the wrath of the LORD, and I cannot hold it in.""
",2020-01-04 00:00:00,7,"If you've read any of my other reviews of Travolta flicks, you might have seen I prefer him as a villain. Here he crosses the line when his wife becomes a murder target, although that isn't known at the start of the picture. Appearing at first to be a mugging gone wrong, the story evolves into a complex thriller involving a major drug dealer, corrupt cops and a top government official. Actually, Stanley Hill (Travolta) is a former black ops assassin for hire, along with buddy, barber Dennis (Christopher Meloni), and now that I think about it, it would have been interesting if Travolta and Meloni had switched roles for this picture. Meloni as well switches sides from his 'Law and Order' background to play dirty against the even dirtier bad guys who come after Stan once he gets a bit too nosy. This is a fairly standard revenge thriller with the occasional flip flop of the heroes and villains holding the advantage. Only thing is, like a lot of these stories, there's never an aftermath concerning the killing of a police detective from a hospital bed, or calling into account the vehicles demolished while pursuing one's quarry. It's expected you put your brain on hold and go with the flow until the picture's protagonist makes things right, at least in his world. That's what happens here, with Stan and Dennis eventually retiring to the sunny shores of Ixtapa. Must be nice."
" Banter between Meloni and Travolta Saves It.
",2019-11-30 00:00:00,6,"Feels like a B movie from the late 90s or early 2000s, in the tradition of Liam Nelson and john wick. The banter between meloni and travolta offers a much needed escape from the drudgery of watching people being executed to satisfy Travolta's vengeance needs. Not plausible at all.
The corrupt governor stuff is over the top and cliched. Did travolta walk away from a close shotgun blast? What kind of magical armor is he wearing. Besides for travolta and meloni , the other actors are unknown fill ins, but i did like the 'nice hair' detective. I guess the govenor is famous in a ""B-movie"" kind of way, i have seen him before.
I would have liked more interaction between the 'nice hair' detective and travolta and meloni. Travolta's hair piece is epic and expertly coiffed. No wonder he only took a shave at the barbershop. The title of the movie is pretty bad, and the religious discussions feel forced. Had to fast forward a few slow parts. Travolta's son in law seemed more annoyed at being late than shocked at being shot in the shoulder.
I look forward to seeing travolta and officer stabler from law and order teaming up once again, but without so many people being killed.
I think almost 30 people shot and killed, as well as people being stabbed or arms crushed. Seems disproportionate for one woman."
" John Wick & Death Wish done Poorly
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,4,"5 minutes into this movie, I wasn't sure if it was going to be a statement on gun violence. 10 minutes into the movie, I was stunned at the really bad hairpiece John Travolta was wearing. 20 minutes in, I was pretty sure I would not finish the movie, as the acting was not good, the story was worse, being unrealistic, illogical, and poorly thought out. It simply doesn't make much sense, and Travolta, although he has had some pretty good movies in the past, fails to deliver here."
" Not That Bad
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,7,"Some of reviews about this movie is just as bad as they say this movie is. It's an action movie.!
It's not supposed to be art. It's made to entertain and I was entertained. It's an ok movie and Travolta is great as a badass vigilante.
So if you're in the moo for action, this is ok."
" A Bloody but entertaining crime/comedy
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,7,"They should make a sequel. They're a funny killing duo. It kept me watching but did they want us to take them seriously? I laughed at some of their banter with each other. Almost like Stan & Laurel, even Abbot & Costello, only lots of guns, fights and blood."
" Pathetic writing
",2019-10-26 00:00:00,2,Horrible writing. Total piece of shit. Unrealistic and apparently the shitty writers are children with no life experience yet. 3rd grade special ops awareness.
" Geriatric Wrath
",2019-10-23 00:00:00,5,"The wig was hilarious, the bickering between the ""Grandpa Black OPS"" characters was kind of funny. Some of the acting by Lenny K was especially funny. Is it funny or sad? It was train wreck that kept me watching, not sure what kind of hypnosis they used to get me to think it was ok, but we'll done with that."
" Not a hater of Travolta
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,10,"Just cause you dont agree with his religion doesn't mean you should bash the hell out of him especially, in a good movie.
Why do so called critics think they can do that? A critic is someone who is versatile. Can put biases aside and tell the freaking truth!!!!!!!!!"
" Great Movie
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,10,"In a world where finding a good movie to watch is hard. Especially,on Netflix, who at one point in time was the premier service to have. Fast forward to today, you can no longer get 3 DVDs and unlimited streaming of anything you wanted to watch. Now you deal with ""what comes close"" to what you originally wanted!
Why this movie is only 5 stars just influence me more to watch lesser rated shows. Awesome Movie!!!!!"
" Alternate reality
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,3,"Where things happen that characters completely ignore, like a guy with a senior management job who just never calls in and never shows up again; supposed weapons experts use a shooting range without eye or ear protection and who leave weapons full of ammo laying around unsecured; or a babysitter who gets killed, provoking no reaction from the little boy she watches, and then disappears; and ""doubled security"" but the gate guard is reading a magazine. But why go on? It's Death Wish rerun."
" Entertaining movie, familiar plot line
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,7,"The plot of this movie has been done many times, but it's up to the actors and actresses to add their own 'spice' to it. Travolta added his brand of acting to it and it was entertaining. He and Chris Meloni had a good chemistry together as partners and although this isn't an Academy award winner by any means, I enjoyed watching it to kill an hour and a half of time where I needed something fun to watch."
" Almost......
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,6,Chris and John do a great job as would be expected. Some of the scenes they were in could have been better. This is likely a director or script issue. I would have given this a 7 (which to me is a decent movie) but the scene that took the 7th star....well no spoilers in this review. I did chuckle a bit at that scene since it was so poorly written and unbelievable. I do wish they had done a bit better of a job with the interactions of Chris and John I think they missed a great opportunity there.
" Broken Continuity, Horrible Acting, Bad Directing
",2019-09-25 00:00:00,1,"I'm not even going to bother reviewing this movie because every 5minutes it felt like something new was happening and loosely connected to the previous story. It's like showing the same face from scene to scene = storyline with this garbage.
My question is: how the hell did the producers, directors and actors look at the final product and think ""yes, this is such a great thing to put out there""."
" I just love John and Christopher!
",2019-09-24 00:00:00,7,"This movie fit right into my action super action movie day. I like anything John Travolta cheesy or not. And I've always liked Chris and his rolls even though they're mostly supporting, he's still at it and he still got it."
" NUMBER 1
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,5,"Number 1 worst hair piece ever! I am a Travolta fan but for the eighteen million dollar budget, why not splurge and get a fifty or sixty dollar piece? I have seen ten day old road kill in better condition."
" Mediocre
",2019-09-20 00:00:00,4,"Let me write a plot: A former ""black ops"", or ""special forces"", or ""CIA NOC"", or ""MI5 (or 6)"", or ""FSB"", or ""Mossad"", or ""Navy Seal"" ""Agent/Hitman"" is retired. Someone (typically the spouse), is murdered for no reason, and ""Ta-Da"": The former hitman goes on a revenge killing spree. I have seen nearly identical plots from this film or ""Hitman"" with Sean Penn, or ""John Wick"" with Keanu Reeves (3 films so far), or ""Rambo"" with Sly Stallone (5 films so far), ad infinitum. That is only 10 films, & I haven't even tried. I could name 2 dozen more. It is ridiculous people still pay money to see them. Typically, the actor is male, and mid-life in their film career. Past their prime, for sure. So this is simply just another one. Boring. Unless you are 12 years old, then it is ""cool"". Grow up; please."
" I am bothered...a little....
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,4,"Despite the title this movie is more of a buddy cop/spy movie. Travolta, with an hair piece that refuses to budge under any circumstance, seems to want to coast through any emotional scenes as quickly as possible. The movie is really about two former spys/or feds/or something of the sort, having an excuse to get back together and have a good ole' time shooting and chasing the bad guys. Some of their banter and relationship works but the danger or action never amounts to enough to create any real jeopardy especially when Travolta at best looks bothered by what he has to do.It's competently directed, in a get-it-done-and-move-on, style and the plot has a few good twists but leads to an essentially ridiculous final confrontation. But really there is nothing at stake here other than the mechanics of the plot--Travolta and his character don't ever display any real wrath and the film never builds up any real outrage at the political intrigue stuff it is more about than revenge. Shot on Location in Columbus Ohio it has a few Buckeye jokes and Ohio deserves credit for letting a movie like this get made in real government locations--but it's kind of so what. The opening credits may be the most energetic part of the movie as they attempt to set up a State and City on the verge of anarchy--something that then drains away almost immediately.Budget seems pretty limited, Travolta probably being paid half of what they had to spent, and again he doesn't seem committed to the material which doesn't offer much to commit to. It's not terrible but it should be better on almost every level."
" Brilliant Movie, Travolta fits in perfectly
",2019-08-05 00:00:00,7,"I really hate people who dont just enjoy movies for what they are and feel the need to go super in depth and tear a film to shreds when it's not needed, Travolta and this movie kicks ass no question ,Great action, Great actors ,great film 5.4 out of 10 is complete bs."
" Good revenge film worth watching
",2019-07-07 00:00:00,6,It's a bit generic but if you love revenge flicks this is for you.
" I am Joke
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,4,"I can't believe this movie came out just 3 years ago; it is so like B-grade crime/conspiracy dramas of 80s/90s. You can tell from the first frame that this is a production of half-hearted attempts, be it acting, writing, or direction. Jokes, characters, story, and scenes are all clichéd. Decisions and reactions from the characters, however, do produce a chuckle every now and then which helps keep you from dozing off."
" How not to make a movie
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,1,"How did they manage to take two excellent actors like Travolta and Meloni and make such a trash film with them? It was logically inconsistent, the dialogue was trite and shallow, the plot was predictable where it wasn't utterly ridiculous and oh my GOD Travolta's hair piece was dreadful. I couldn't focus on the film most of the time because I was so distracted by how bad the hair was. The man is an acting legend, I thought the scene where he went to a barber shop was so he could start his revenge spree by killing the person who had done that to his head.
I can't believe anyone, let alone multiple people, rated this movie a ten. There is suspending disbelief and then there is just unbelievable, as in it's unbelievable that someone could make two great actors perform in this piece of rubbish.
If you like Travolta or Melosi please don't watch this dumpster fire of a movie."
" Not bad for what it is. entertaining
",2019-05-16 00:00:00,9,"The movie was predictable in a lot of ways but no different that the other movies in this genre. If you say otherwise, John Wick is as predictable and is a good movie also. Travolta can still carry a movie, yes the hair piece is not good, but the movie was pretty good overall. Not going to win a Oscar but makes for an enjoyable watch."
" Christopher Meloni 😍😍
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,6,"Meloni walks all over Travolta in this movie
He deserves so much more credit than he gets in his roles."
" Seen it all before
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,4,A cliched story with robotic lead performance from Travolta. We've seen this revenge style film 1000's of times and mainly better than this. The action scenes was ok and it just about passes the time half watching at home but that's about it.
" A bit of a blow out
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,4,"John Travolta does his turn in the avenging husband role, as we've seen many times before in movies like Death Sentence, Death Wish and (my personal favourite) Law Abiding Citizen.It has a pretty decent start but as soon as the revenge parts kick off, it loses all credibility, when a friend (Dennis) decides to be his backup/wing man. It's like, ""Hey! You're having a revenge party! Can I join in?!""The bad guys are very clichéd; the writing in general is pretty lazy. The whole plot and all of the 'twists' therein roll out in conveyor belt predictability. I did nearly switch off half way through but, for some reason thought it might improve at some point, which it didn't.The acting throughout is reasonable, the action sequences are half decent but the whole thing has a pretty large meh factor because it's been done awfully similar to this before - with the exception of the dumb inclusion of the side-kick. I could be wrong, that might be (to some) the best part of the film but it felt too much like Starsky and Hutch on a joint Death Wish.If they claimed it was made as a retro-homage to TV movies of the 90s, that would actually make some sense. Otherwise, a tad silly and somewhat uninteresting."
" Solid Travolta action
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,7,Easy to enjoy Travolta being the bad ass in this movie. Villains are a bit weak but nevertheless worth watching.
" Unbelievable
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,6,"Way too far fetched, wooden acting from 90% of the cast.
I have rated this a generous 6/10 - I certainly wouldn't watch this again, nor would I recommend it to anyone I like."
" I Am Tired
",2019-03-02 00:00:00,2,"This is John Travolta on slow mo. Sorry, but I was dissapointed to see how sluggish this movie was. It was like the actors were moving through molasses. The action and dialogue were pretty pathetic. Sorry but a waste of time."
" Solid Action Flick
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,7,"It is what it is: a solid action flick. It's totally unrealistic, but entertaining. If you liked the Death Wish franchise, then you'll like this."
" John Travolta Is Not ""The Punisher"".
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,3,"Stanley (John Travolta) arrives at an airport returning home from a job interview. He is greeted by his loving wife at the airport terminal and the two briefly catch up. As they walk outside to their car, Stanley and his wife are attacked by a couple of street thugs. Stanley is knocked out and his wife is murdered...Stanley seeks justice by investigating his wife's killer and the real reason behind it all. Like most revenge movies, Stanley has a dark hidden past and a set of skills that he revisits to uncover who is responsible for his wife's death.Without spoiling anything, there seems to be a trend in the world of cinema presently- an older man loses something, he just happens to have a set of skills and the villains have messed with the wrong man blah blah blah.I Am Wrath is overall just another B grade revenge story with a predictable story line straight to the finish line. While I don't normally mind John Travolta, this is a very disappointing film for his career. I feel he is trying his best, but the script writing and direction here couldn't help him deliver something fresh or exciting.From an action point of view, our hero is able to keep the enemies down with one bullet, and perfectly fires each shot. But our villains continually miss and the hero seems bulletproof. Sure, this normally sounds like fun but it's actually rather painful to see. And for some reason, John Travolta is dressed between a Terminator and The Punisher.3.0/10

",2018-09-22 00:00:00,6,"I like how Travolta hangs on to his ""bad ass"" history. Though they could have sent him in with the

Travolta plays a realistic vigilanti yet his wig is so obviously bad it reduces his commanding performance. You would think they could have upped the spend on our hero's hairpiece....!!Expect the normal fast (ish) revenge movie, with little thought provoking narrative or romantic aspect. I did ask myself... shouldn't Travolta be doing better produced and higher budget movies by now ?"
" John Travolta Winding Down His Used-To-Be Excellent Movie Career
",2018-07-21 00:00:00,5,"07/21/2018 A predictable revenge storyline with lame/cliché dialog. Not even close to what we should expect from John Travolta's acting, nor his contemporary fellow actors and this absolutely low grade, poor choice of a movie. If this is his future, then he's done. And his Count Dracula/Nicolas Cage hairdo sucks/looks fake because it is fake, he's bald in real life and would look much better/more real life as a bald guy. Not what I expected in a J.T. movie - very disappointed. Five (5) stars is about right."

Horrible, ridiculous script with so many holes, a herd of elephants could fall through. Terrible editing. It is amazing anybody would have put up the money for this tripe.

" I Am Wrath is well worth seeing and should really please revenge movie buffs.
",2018-07-17 00:00:00,7,"Stanley (Travolta) is just a regular working man with a wife, daughter and grandson. Or so it would seem. When his wife Vivian (De Mornay) is killed in an assault in a Fatal Combat-style parking lot situation, he falls back on his Special Ops training so he can track down the baddies responsible. He ends up re-teaming with his old buddy Dennis (Meloni) because the streets of Ohio are too dangerous to navigate alone. Even though they are both highly-trained professionals with an arsenal of guns and knives at their disposal, they didn't count on one thing...that there's a conspiracy that goes all the way to the top. Now having to fight off drug dealing goons, corrupt cops and the like is not enough. Our heroes will have to face the Mr. Big at the top...but who is it? Falling back on the old-time religion, a kindly priest gives Stanley a bible, and it just happens to open to a page declaring I AM WRATH. Stanley decides to take it as a sign and exerts all his wrath on the baddies! But can he save what remains of his family? Find out today...Since Travolta doesn't do many action movies, we liked to think of this as a sequel to Chains of Gold. Maybe ""I Am Scott Barnes"" doesn't have quite the same ring to it, but it didn't stop us from imagining what Barnes's life might be like 25 years later. We were happy with what we saw - I Am Wrath might not be the most original movie to come down the pike, but who really cares? As long as the filmmakers stick to what works in the revenge movie format, there are no problems. Thankfully, here they do. What could have been a disaster is in actuality is a crowd-pleasing winner that delivers the goods. You truly get Travolta (and Meloni) unleashed, and as such the kill count is much higher than Scott Barnes ever dared to go for. 
Besides our beloved revenge movies, another thing we always love seeing is older heroes laying the smacketh down on young punks. It truly was a joy watching the 62-year-old Travolta shooting, stabbing, and beating up the young whippersnappers. Director Russell, last heard from on the site when we reviewed his Eraser (1996), clearly learned from his time working with Schwarzenegger - keep the pace snappy, and make sure you have a charismatic lead hero. That's what separates Travolta from someone like a Seagal, who has appeared in similar projects as this one. Travolta has charisma. As does Christopher Meloni (AKA Stabler), so when they're together, sparks really fly. And there's no stupid, annoying bickering or some sassy little kid to get in the way of all the awesome revenge action. It's really a winner all around. 
If this movie had come out anytime between, say 1996 and 2004, it would have gone to theaters. But because Hollywood exclusively makes superhero movies now, everything non-spandex-related gets bumped down to On Demand, Netflix, or Redbox. That's no longer a stigma. Of course, we've been celebrating DTV movies since day one, so it's never been a stigma for us, but generally speaking, just because DeNiro or Travolta, or anyone else, ends up on some streaming service doesn't mean their career is floundering like it used to mean in the past. It just means Hollywood has no time for them anymore because they're preoccupied with the capes-and-tights brigade. I Am Wrath shows you can make small, quality product that comes directly into your home and still has A-list talent involved. This appears to be the future of entertainment, so let's all prepare for that. 
Finally, it should be noted that Dennis's hideout and front is a barbershop. This of all things probably presented a dilemma for Stanley (or should we say Travolta), seeing as his hair is not real. So he gets a shave instead. How convenient. It's unlikely Dennis could have lifted the wig off, then placed it back on and then called that a haircut. Travolta should have done like he did in From Paris With Love (2010), and gotten rid of the hairpiece altogether. It might have added to the overall grit of the movie. 
In the end, I Am Wrath is well worth seeing and should really please revenge movie buffs."
" John Travolta Stars in a Revenge Thriller
",2018-06-14 00:00:00,5,"The movie begins with news montages about the unprecedented crime wave in Columbus, Ohio. Contrarily, Governor John Meserve (Patrick St. Esprit) gives a press conference and says the opposite: crime is down. When questioned by protestors about a proposed pipeline, Meserve promises that he has commissioned an independent study of the pipeline. Vivian (Rebecca De Mornay), who has something to say about the proposed pipeline, picks up her unemployed husband Stanley (John Travolta), who has returned from a positive job interview to manage a factory in California. At the diffusely lit and practically unoccupied airport parking garage, a man with a fly tattoo on his face (Charley = Luis Da Silva Jr.) approaches and asks them for money. Stanley politely refuses, but two other men mysteriously sneak up on Stanley and stun him with a blow to the head. The first man fatally stabs Vivian and takes her wallet. Although dazed, Stanley watches the men flee. With Stanley's description of Charley, the police are able to apprehend him. But even though Stanley picks him out the lineup, the police detectives (Gibson = Sam Trammell / Walker = Asante Jones) let him go. They say that his descriptions changed too much (they didn't). Stanley, despondent and enraged, yearns for revenge. While tracking down the men, Stanley realizes that the fatal mugging was no random attack. There were political forces behind his wife's murder. Now he has bigger fish to fry.Stanley, with his mercenary past, is well-equipped to get his revenge. He also has an ally in a barber, Dennis (Christopher Meloni). Together these guys are dynamite. But you've seen it all before. The flic borrows from other films, such as ""Goldfinger"" (car-crush scene) and ""Taken"" (hostage part). The ending with the last shootout doesn't ring true. And there are questions: for instance, why is Stanley's life spared as he is the only witness to the crime in the garage (and the bad guys lack empathy)? But some may like the fact that the film does not require much brainpower to figure out. Also, both Travolta and Meloni are good and rise above their material, which is not strong despite the plot twists. Christopher Meloni at age 55 is in excellent physical condition; Travolta's hair (including the hairline) is peculiar. The movie was filmed on location in Columbus, Ohio."
" Another Addition Into Revenge Thriller Genre
",2018-06-09 00:00:00,2,"'I Am Wrath' is by the numbers cliché ridden action ride that fails to offer much entertainment. The script is so dull, that all the twists are not twisty enough and the drawn out dialogue doesn't give much material to the actors. And that's sad, because the two main stars, John Travolta and Christopher Meloni have nice free flowing chemistry between them, and both of them are charismatic and talented to pull off bad ass tough guys with emotional range. But the charm of these two actors weren't just enough to enliven otherwise dull film. Maybe the film would have been better with William Friedkin's (who was in talks to direct the film) treatment. Not totally bad film overall, and I don't say that very often, but 'I Am Wrath' is complete waste of time."
" Disturbing
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,2,"Disturbing to see Rebecca De Morney, her face has had so much work on it I had to Google to see which actress was playing his wife. And let's not forget John Travoltas awful wig was also so bad it was hard to concentrate on this movie. What is wrong with actors and actresses that can't age gracefully these two look like monsters I thought I was watching a thriller not a horror film 
 This could've been a good film about the corrupt police and getting justice for your wife but it was overshadowed by poor plastic surgery"
" Starts weak but gets better and better throughout
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,8,"Man, if your up for an old school revenge movie then this is it. The best part of this movie is the partnership between Stan (Travolta) and Dennis (Meloni). The banter between the two is just spot on and hilarious. As the movie goes on it really feels like these two have a past and are syncing back up into their old ways. Stan tries to keep Dennis out of it at first but, when Dennis keeps pushing Stan let's him in on the mission and it feels organic.Of course there's some cheesy moments in this movie but, suprisingly there aren't as many as you would expect.I know I wasn't expecting too much from this movie and ended up loving it.My only problem with the movie is there's a significant death around the end of the movie that has no emotional reaction from any characters at any point. I kept waiting to see a funeral or a freak out but it was like the person killed just didn't exist. It was strange.Well worth the watch."
" You got three minutes.
",2018-03-26 00:00:00,8,"Columbus. Car Manufacture manager Stanley Hill (John Travolta) flies home to Ohio from a job interview. His wife gets toasted in the parking garage, in a city where we have been told, ""nothing's random."" After identifying the culprit in a police line up, the cops let the killer walk. Well it seems John worked as ""the real ghost stuff"" and has a friend (Christopher Meloni) who runs a barber shop and black ops operation in Columbus, Ohio...I guess due to the high demand. Once you can get past this and the Botox face, the film becomes a decent vigilante movie.The film is simple. The twists are so overt and so clue heavy, it is hard to even tag them as a twist. The production includes some token religious scene so we can get the title. The banter between partners provides humor. There is plenty of killing by gun fire, hand to hand, knives, and explosions.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Solid vigilante entertainment."
" So poorly produced it's painful to watch
",2017-12-11 00:00:00,1,"This movie must have sounded great when they wrote the outline on a gin- soaked bevnap in some LA nightclub/pre-rehab center.Elements of several movie franchises are crammed into one very messy omelet of trope and cliché. My guess is that when they realized how old Travolta had gotten, there only solution was to toss Meloni into the mix. The movie has so many plot holes, continuity errors and thick headed moments your eyes will hurt from so much rolling."
" John Travolta makes this film watchable and fun.
",2017-11-28 00:00:00,6,"Let me get to it, this film was not half bad. John Travolta is a very good actor and I feel for a direct to DVD film as this is was done exceptionally well by director Chuck Russell.The story is your typical revenge thriller formula but I think this was elevated by Chuck Russell and John.When I first seen this my expectations were low but was pleasantly surprised on how it was handled. It's very entertaining from start to finish.The action scenes are pretty good for it's budget, the writing is average at best but again, it's elevated by the director and John. The movie knows wait it is, and it
knows it, the film doesn't try to be more, which is always good because I hate movies that do when they really don't.Overall a good direct to DVD action film that is fun to watch, there is just enough action scenes, one liners and thrills to keep you entertained. It passes the time.I give it a 6/10. I highly recommend it."
" Travolta does Bronson badly
",2017-11-22 00:00:00,3,"First off, I thought John Travolta had accepted his male pattern baldness, but based upon the terrible wig atop his head in this film, I guess that is not the case. Besides the bad wig, we have yet another middle aged vigilante ""Death Wish"" knock-off. Travolta plays a mild mannered upright citizen who's wife, Rebecca De Mornay, is murdered during a mugging gone wrong, but when the justice system sets the murderers free, it's up to Vinnie Barbarino to go all Charles Bronson on these lowlifes. To help him go all Mr. Majestic on his wife's murderers, he enlists the help of lowlife friend Christopher Meloni, which is kind of fun since Meloni played a straight arrow cop on ""Law & Order"" for so many years. Also in the film's favor is director Chuck Russell, who did the underrated remake of ""The Blob,"" Jim Carrey's best comedy, ""The Mask,"" and also directed everyone's favorite Nightmare on Elm Street sequel, Dream Warriors. The film was also shot by Andrzej Sekula, who did ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" among may other respectable genre films. However, the script for ""I Am Wrath"" is such an awful mishmash of clichés that it renders the film nearly unwatchable. Outside of not being able to take my eyes off of Travolta's terrible rug, Meloni is the only thing worth watching in the film. If you need a recent vigilante film fix, stick with Kevin Bacon in ""Death Sentence,"" Keanu Reeves in ""John Wick,"" or Michael Caine in ""Harry Brown."""
" I Am a Ripoff of Every ""Death Wish"" and Buddy-Buddy Action Genre Films
",2017-11-22 00:00:00,5,"According to Wikipedia, Michael Caine, asked his opinion of ""Jaws: The Revenge,"" is quoted as replying, ""I have never seen it, but by all accounts it is terrible. However, I have seen the house that it built, and it is terrific."" Well, Caine wanted a house, Maybe John Travolta needed a tweak or two on his jets. It's the only reason I can think of that Travolta took this part. take the money and run or rather, take the money and fly. Maybe the exhibitors attended a showing of ""I Am Wrath."" Their response? The movie went straight to video. Actually, the film is not bad if you give it a very long leash. One can figure out the real bad guy within 10 minutes. The whole affair is a hodgepodge of ""Death Wish"" films (all five of them) the John Wick films, hundreds of buddy type movies, and other genres of films already seen if you are over 18 years old. Maybe the only film ""I Am Wrath"" has not copied in some form or other is ""The Sound of Music."""
" One of the worst movies I've ever seen!!!
",2017-11-18 00:00:00,1,"I don't know whats worse here: the morons on this site, actually thinking this is a good movie or John Travoltas fake looking wig. Which must be because he wants to look younger and cool like he actually was in Face/Off 20 years ago. This crap is clearly amateur made with a low budget. The fact that it's actually directed by Chuck Russel who made ""The Mask"" and ""Eraser"" two of my all time favorite movies is embarrassing. A man with his experience should have made a much better movie. For some reason it's rated R, when there is no blood in it, no real swearing, except the f-bomb said one time and it feels like a TV-movie made 30 years ago. Apart from John Travolta in his worst performance since Battlefield Earth and Rebecca De Mornay (her last name always makes me think of lasagna) who is barely in the movie and wasted here, this movie mostly consists of unknown actors giving terrible performances. Rebecca De Mornay-sauce, plays Travoltas wife and she is deliberately killed in a staged robbery in a parking-lot. Why she had to die, I never understood. If it was explained I stopped paying attention a long time before. This movie wants to be Taken, it wants to be The Expendables and it fails at both. John Travolta and Christopher Meloni are laughably pathetic as some old people who belongs in nursing homes, taking on dangerous street criminals. And they are actually good at it?? Yeah right!! And this is because they were apparently involved in black ops, Im guessing around WW1, given how old they seem. All though dangerous is not the word I would use to describe the pathetic cliché ridden street criminals in this joke of a movie.Most ridiculous scene: Travolta gets a giant tattoo of the movies title on his back. In cheap-ass amateur made movies like this a tattoo like that apparently only takes 5 minutes to make. Not hours and at least two visits to the tattoo artist like it would in real life. And the bad-guy Travolta is looking for tells him to lie still, because the tattoo is still wet, only to threaten him with a gun and tell him to get up a second later. When the bad-guy clearly had the advantage of either torturing Travolta with the tattoo needle or simply killing him as he was lying vulnerable on the table. Yes that is an actual scene in this bullshit of a crappy Z-movie that I hate!!! We also have the cliché corrupt governor (who probably ordered the hit on the wife) sitting in the back of his limo drinking scotch and giving orders to an equally corrupt detective. Apart from Travoltas horrible wig (he must have gone bald and gotten way too much Botox) the biggest mystery is how a movie this bad ever got green-lighted. I got a call, while watching this turd of a movie with a friend. When I got back in the room, he had nearly fallen asleep from boredom. Now I don't mind action B-movies if they are made well and have a decent budget and decent acting. This movie has none of that. And the people that like this must either be retarded or teenage boys who don't know any better. Steer clear of this bullshit!! Consider yourself warned!!"
" All-too-familiar Taken clone
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,5,"I AM WRATH sees director Chuck Russell (whose magnum opus is still THE BLOB) return to directing after an absence of a decade and a half. He's chosen an action thriller vehicle for the latest ageing leading man turned action star, namely John Travolta, complete with a hair transplant and a fine line in bad-ass one-liners. This is a rather cheap copy of the kind of formula that TAKEN has popularised these days, and it sees Travolta going on a rampage of revenge after his wife is brutally murdered by a gang of thugs.The problem with I AM WRATH is the familiarity of the plot. You can work out the big twist in the first five minutes and often the writing feels lazy and second-rate. Travolta is okay as the lead but the film lacks decent choreography in the fight scenes and the Thai guy they got to do the choreography did an only average job. Some bits could have been great, like when a Stanley knife is used as a weapon, but GREEN ROOM did a similar moment much better. Supporting Travolta is a near-unrecognisable Rebecca De Mornay, but the best player is Christopher Meroni who gets all of the best lines as the wisecracking buddy."
" How not to make a revenge thriller
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,3,"I Am Wrath was just barely competent to watch. The opening mugging/murder scene had some of the worst continuity mistakes I've seen in a Hollywood blockbuster. While the cast was competent, the casting was stereotypical black/Latino bad guys and white ""highly trained"" good guys. I cringed at some of the lines. I imagine the script must have had many hands on it and many rewrites. John Travolta puts in an average performance, but the lightweight script and lackluster directing leave him out on a limb with this performance. And we are supposed to believe that Travolta at 62 years of age is a ball-busting tough guy? Originally Nick Cage was cast to play the lead, perhaps he's become wise enough to sniff out a stinker. At least his age would not have been so damning as it is for Travolta.Speaking of tough guys, Christopher Meloni turned in an affable performance providing support and a touch of one-liner comedy. Alas it's difficult to believe he gets whacked in the shins by a baseball bat and the bat loses. In real life the bat would not break and he wouldn't have been able to walk for at least a week. His performance was the only bright spot in a movie that never hinted at being a buddy action-comedy but becomes one anyway. John Wick this movie is not.The movie's biggest sin was its predictability. You knew right from the beginning why the wife was killed, who ordered the hit, and why the corrupt cops could do nothing about it. Then every step of the way you knew what Travolta's character was going to do, and never did we think that he wouldn't get away with it right up to the unsatisfying ending (gee, no surprises when the bullet proof vest is revealed early in the film).I Am Wrath had no mystery, no discovery, and quite often no explanation. This would be exhibit 1A as to how Hollywood ruins movies."
" This is not funny anymore
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,1,"'I Am Wrath' is very moving film - it is not hard to move on after first fifteen minutes. I managed to sit through it somehow. It's almost like John Travolta wanted to make a lousy parody of Nicolas Cage. 'John Wick' made revenge movies look cool again, and 'I Am Wrath' really tries to emulate similar coolness but it falls out like toothless alligator trying to eat buffalo. Travolta and Christopher Meloni has good chemistry between them, but the script is too shallow that the actors don't have enough material to work on. It uses every, absolutely every known cliché to human kind, that all the twists of the film can be guessed at the opening credits even if you have turned off your brain almost comatose like state. No surprises, no style. Totally unnecessary movie.Oh yeah, John Travolta's hairpiece deserves it's own movie."
" No, please God. No.
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,1,"Let's not waste time here....Terrible direction, the actors don't appear to all be on the same page. The director also appears not to understand the elements of an action film: urgency! None to be found.The lighting is hideous to say the least, as a long time resident of Columbus, Ohio I would like to say Columbus has some of the most uninspired skyline and atmospheric shots. Travolta and Merloni are good, but it's hard to make a garbage script into a great film. Din't bother to watch past the first 40 minutes. I was falling asleep. And oh, what's with all the unmotivated slow motion shots? Not even worth the price of a DVD rental."
