" Imvestigate about child kidnapper and murderer
",2020-07-02 00:00:00,7,A man abducted and killed kids around area..and two detectives tries find him and save 2 kids...i like this movie becozz of investigates linear way without any unwanted branch stories...but photography are same for flsahback and normal..
" No plot twists, no mystery and poor drama
",2020-06-25 00:00:00,3,"It has 100% on rotten tomatoes and I can't understand why...
Yeah, it does have some metaphors and religious motives, but that's about it... it has literally no plot twists and mystery. There's no 'crime solving', it's all a pretext for a random rat chase for the killer.
The drama is very poor, the main character is not very relatable and the movie overall feels distant from the characters.Maybe I am missing something but the movie is a constellation of plot holes and missed opportunities. It has nothing to do with it being Danish, the production is good. It's the writing that's really bad."
" Totally Implausible Storyline. Annoying to watch.
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,5,"Previous episodes were strong but police response in this movie is so unbelievably stupid and annoyingingly incompetent it was often hard to keep watchIng.>>>>SPOILERS<<<<Opening the door in an ICE train at over 200 km/h - if it's even possible - and someone jumps out and stands up after that. Btw train off course doesn't stopThen they find the bad guy and they really need shooting lessons because they can't hit him even at one meter distance. Off course he gets away but although you know the license plate and car description (with Windows shot to pieces) you don't ask the helicopter above you to look for it. That would be too easy. No - the
logical thing to do is focus on getting an ambulance and sit in the hospital waiting after.When you then know the bad guy is in the hospital you worry about arranging a priest instead of hunting the criminal that just murdered two people. And of course you don't understand what it means when your colleague tell's you he's behind you.When you know the villain must be close you never look around but at your colleague that it's just stabbed so he can catch you just by walking up behind you.And when you finally find the boat house with the helicopter you don't hover above the walkboard and jump out. Noooo that's too easy. You fly to the beach without keeping an eye at the boathouse and walk there. Totally unbelievableThen you finally go looking for the villain again and you stare into the sea so he can just walk up from behind from the beach and stab you. Strong scene. Not."
" This adaptation is a joke
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,5,"Five stars only for the performance of actors and the cinematography. It is loosely based, 30% at most, on the book by Jussi Adler-Olsen, oversimplyfuing to plot and the characters. The new plot makes little sense."
" Scandi-Noir fused with high quality action and a Norwegian psycho
",2019-08-23 00:00:00,7,"""Flaskepost fra P"" continues the film series based on Jussi Adler-Olsen's books about Copenhagen crime fighters Mørck (Lie Kaas) and Assad (Fares) and is the best iteration yet. The reasons are several, the film's premise is two children of an isolationist religious sect are kidnapped by one of the members (Sverre Hagen) and held for a ransom; there are far more action sequences than in the two previous films; and, the best part, the writers acknowledge the events that has happened in previous films thus writing in some longed for character development. Also, for the first time in the series history, the relationship between the two main characters finally have some emotions to it. So this is a go to if you're prepared for an intriguing Nordic crime drama."
" Good entertainment
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,7,"This is the best chapter among the three, in my opinion. ""Department Q"" is a honest, low-flying franchise; it does few things, but does them very well. It's some kind of a very very good, 2-hours long tv episode. It keeps you hooked till the end (that's something very important in crime fiction), while entertaining you with good photography, good acting, and some tongue-in-cheek humor.A special mention for the lead actor, that delivers an outstanding interpretation here, something worth of Hollywood in my opinion.Recommended for a relaxing evening at home, it's fiction with no flaws. On a side note, some sequences in all three movies are violent or gory and can be disturbing to some."
" Starts Out Good
",2019-05-20 00:00:00,6,"DEPARTMENT Q is not a bad movie. It starts out very good and intriguing. The premise feels very different and promising. As things unfold, however, we realize that this movie will be nothing special.It's actually pretty average. Not bad at all, by any means. The acting is good and so is the directing. But there's no great ending or anything like that. It starts out better than it ends, so that makes it a little disappointing. Overall, it's not bad though. Recommend for those looking for something a little different, but not too different."
" I can't watch kids getting hurt by evil
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,1,"The actors are great and I have seen one of the other movies and they are very well directed, good stories and interesting.
I have just had enough of evil especially against kids so I couldn't finish it.
Same with holocaust movies, violence, rape and killing of kids. So it is not for me and I do not watch these types of movies anymore. Especially after becoming a parent myself then it is just to painful a theme.
Quality wise the movie, the story, the characters and the acting is great. I can recommend the other movies with the detective duo. They are very talented and there is an interesting chemistry and dialogue between them."
" Religious communities
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,6,"""Flaskepost fra P"" tells the story of a serial killer who hunts down his child victims in a closed religious community that avoids contact to the outer world. Investigations are immensly difficult in this milieu but time is running out.The film is more or less your average middle-budget crime movie. The religious community creates an interesting atmosphere and a nice framework, however the tired and burned out cop is a stereotype that every second thriller seems to use these days. The case itself is solid and does keep you entertained, nonetheless it doesn't press you into your seat or make you gasp for air.All in all this is a good pick for people who want to spend a nice evening with a solid crime movie. It is not outstanding but also doesn't do much wrong."
" Super Creepy Villian In Decent Thriller
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,8,"I see that this is a third movie in a series of films but I am not familiar with those and therefore my review is solely basing this as a stand alone movie. I really enjoyed this. It has a great blend of thrills, drama and straight up creepiness. This has a religious aspect to it as well and I can't recall seeing another film quite like it. I couldn't see what was coming in this and I liked that. It makes me want to seek out the other films in this series and see what they have to offer. My only complaint is having to read the subtitles and the end was just short of all I wanted it to be. With that being said, in regards to the subtitles, this is why I watch foreign films. I'm sure the next time I watch it I will find more enjoyment in it seeing as I will be able to better watch all that is going on screenwise. Looking forward to that."
" Grim...
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,8,"Available on Netflix. Very dark, not nearly as explicit as the Absent One (3rd one in series), which I elected to skip, after perusing its resumé here at IMDB.A serial killer is stalking religious families, for reasons that become very apparent by the end. Good detective work by our 2 main protagonists helps them zero in on a culprit, but he proves to be as elusive as he is ruthless.Not recommended for kids, but if you like the 'edgy Scandanavian thriller' genre, you may find this one more exciting than the first in the series. As always with Danish films, keep the ff button close at hand. 8/10"
" Pretty good
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,7,"After watching the first 2 films of the series, I was left amazed at the intrigue of this show. They were dark and complex and left you on the edge of your seat. However, this film was below par in my opinion. I still loved it. However, it did not reach my expectations. The plot of this film is probably the darkest of the lot but I felt there wasn't as good a flow to it as the others. Nevertheless, it was a great film to watch which kept me guessing throughout, with a satisfying ending"
" True detective are you?
",2018-07-27 00:00:00,5,"Crime with religious overtones in a deeply closed community, couple of police, one believer, the other atheist and nihilist, general aerial plans of the sea, extensions of crops... To be inspired by True Detective is something recommendable in the current cine noir, but when the inspiration becomes plagiarism it stops being.
The story could have been taken in another way, from the first moment we know who is the culprit, this makes it predictable and in some sections boring.
Not is bad film, but with this story and background they could have done something better and more atmospheric."
" It needed the same director of first 2 movies
",2018-07-01 00:00:00,6,I am gonna keep it short and simple-I think the biggest problem with the movie is that the tone from the first 2 movies is missing from this part.There isn't edge of thrill moment as the first 2 parts had.Seems like director was in hurry to complete the movie.It's watchable but not as good as the first 2 parts.
" Darker, in a Different Way
",2018-05-05 00:00:00,9,"This third installment is, in many ways, the darkest of the series. It's not ""deranged"" dark in the manner of the disturbing ""The Treatment"" (a must see for lovers of the genre - but admittedly a tough film with psychologically destructive activities discussed) but that in addition to involving the murder and abuse of children, and the continuing psychological deterioration of one the its main characters, it also dares to challenge the concept of faith (although like most films that tread in this direction, it fails to spend the added time and argument that can successfully undermine even the most devout adherents, instead - as is also typical - backsliding a bit from it's own dark realistic world view to allow some warmth in). If the first two films challenged what we expect from this genre, and what we expect from genre protagonists, this film also challenges some deeper held beliefs (even if it doesn't quite go far enough) and is all the braver for the effort. Best if watched in order and I am delighted they are filming a fourth in this series!"
" Excellent!
",2018-04-07 00:00:00,10,Excellent adaptation of the book and great casting!
" Unjustified
",2017-06-23 00:00:00,1,The movie premise was very promising. Unfortunately from the interval it starts down sliding and flat.This movie shows how bad is danish police reaction in handling this kind of cases. There is no sense of panic or responsibility from the entire team to help those kids. It's only Carl who has the emotion.The villain cold blood and brutalility is just not justified by the police actions. How can be many well trained police staff can be easily beaten by a weak man who usually tortured women and kids only with scissor.The ending is a relief but still cannot justify the whole movie.
" With an old clue, a new hunt begins.
",2017-05-24 00:00:00,6,"The third film in the 'Department Q' series that adapted from the book series of the same name. For this the director has changed, the one from 'In Order of Disappearance' and I think it was a good move, but the result was not as expected, at least not for me. As the sequels proceeding, it's losing its charm. Yeah, for me still the first film was the best one. That following parts were just okay, which rely highly on the great foundation that laid in the first.Actually this story was good, despite like any cop-and-kidnapper- chase-thriller. But it was developed on the sensitive issue like faith which made the film a little shy. Because they don't want to bring in any serious debate, but wanted to balance everything as much as possible to be neutral from all kinds of this film series' fans/viewer's perspective. So you will be entertained as the title promised, but at the end if you consider it just a film, then it's okay. Otherwise, particularly from the atheist's viewpoint, its not any favourable.The story has a clear explanation for whatever happens, especially about the film character who commits the crime. So it is a challenging time for what Carl Morck believes in. So far we saw him as a tough cop, but this particular case he's dealing with is like he had never encountered before. There are some great scenes, like chasing a train which is actually a turning point in the narration. But the rest of the film was mostly has cliché like any cop who tries to solve the crime.❝With that attitude you'll never enjoy a pork roast.❞The plot for the crime was focused on the initial stage of the tale. The following narration was highly influenced by the cops and their attempt to resolve the issue. But before coming to that, an intentional connection between the two cases was not definitely a masterstroke as I expected. Although it looked something new on the screenplay, which might have worked so good in the dark and slow paced crime-thriller.While they are, Carl and Acid are looking to decipher the puzzle they have got which is dated back nearly a decade, now they come to know that two kids were kidnapped in a similar fashion. They begin to dig deeper from the previous clue for the new incident. If they are right, it is much closer than they have thought to solve it. But how it helps to plan for the fight and their full efforts which told in the final act with a fast pace.Little disappointing was they wanted to remain those two cops as the heroes. So all the heroic acts were a build up from them alone in most of the accounts for the cinematic edgy moments. Especially how the finale turns out, is not appreciable from the writing perspective, other than giving satisfactory episode to the hardcore fans of the film franchise.For me the locations were awesome, all the scenes shot at the right time of the day and its light that sets a fine tone regarding all the developments taking place. A decent follow-up and surely worth a watch if you had liked previous two films, but don't expect it to be the best in the series. Anyway, still some people think it is the best one so far. Now I think it's time to wait for 'The Purity of Vengeance' if they are on to it.6/10"
" The Department Q Series-Part 3:A Conspiracy of Faith.
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,8,"After diving into the jet-black snow of the Nordic Noir dark Comedy In Order of Disappearance in September 2016,I took a look at director Hans Petter Moland's IMDb page,and found that Moland had made the 3rd title in the Department Q movies. Originally being unable to find the film on DVD (it is now out in a box set) I was thrilled to find the BBC recently showing all the movies in the series,which led to me again joining the department.The plot:Spending years working the cold cases with Assad in Department Q, detective Carl Mørck begins expressing about how worn down he is starting to feel. On a beach, a person finds a message in a bottle. As the bottle lands on Department Q, Mørck and Assad realise that the note is from a boy who was kidnapped six years ago by someone with religious connections. Attempting to identify the boy, Assad and Mørck uncover a series of kidnaps and murders have taken place,of children whose parents were involved in various short-lived religious cults,that leads to this being holy final mission for Mørck.View on the film:Ploughing the frost of In Order Of Disappearance,director Hans Petter Moland & cinematographer John Andreas Andersen give the title an icy Nordic Noir chill,with a car park chase and the ocean where the killer hides being given a rough quality expressing the darkness that hides in the isolated locations. Cutting into the backstory of the killer with a Slasher-style flashback ( ""No Mommy!"") Moland gives (what appears to be) the final Department Q movie an earthy gravitas,in stylish close-ups uncovering the burnt-out state of Mørck.Returning to adapt Jussi Adler-Olsen's (who has written 7 books in the series) book,the screenplay by Nikolaj Arcel loses some of the tightly coiled focus of the second entry by leaving open wounds in the investigation,with the ""professional"" level Department Q is held in being at odds with the open goals they miss (no one uses a tracking device to try and find the psycho.) Making the memory of a strange noise a major clue,Arcel borrows from the Giallo genre for a slick Nordic Noir serial killer tale,where the unmasking of the killer is cleverly linked to Nordic Noir's major theme of the corrupt business elite,as Department Q closes its doors."
" Disappointed Q
",2017-05-07 00:00:00,5,"I got a book named Message in a bottle, translated from the original, by Jussi A.O. from my friend, and did not even opened it for a month. Just did not have time. And yesterday I started and finished it. Thats the way I do. Just could not let it go. What a great story. I was so excited. Every character well described. You read it and you feel it,seeing it in front of your eyes. Commented with my husband that will be great if they make a TV show, to describe all characters and details. Jussi wrote a great novel. Then my friend told me there was already a movie too and started laughing. So, I found it, watched it, and from the first second was like : What the...??? Disappointed. Lots of pieces and people been missing, whole story went wrong. If you expecting to see what you read, do not bother. Do not get me wrong, they had a great actors, and scenes, but the story was just weak. Nikolaj Lie Kaas, Fares Fares, Johanne Louise Schmidt, Søren Pilmark, Pål Sverre Hagen and everyone else did their job. Except screenwriter and director. Shame on you, Disappointed Q."
" Good thriller with the creepiest n most effective villain of the Department Q films.
",2017-04-29 00:00:00,8,"This is the third installment in the Department Q series. Saw this few days back on a DVD. It begins with a message in a bottle from disappeared children. The movie starts as a kidnapping drama n then turns into a serial killer thriller n later explores the importance of faith. Some may compare this to Prisoners, True Detectives S1 n Marshland. Nonetheless it is a very solid crime thriller. There is sufficient tension n good amount of atmosphere. The cinematography was gorgeous. This time the movie has some decent action sequences too. Trains, helicopters, car chase. Our two leading detectives, Nikolaj Lie Kaas n Fares Fares acted good. The guy who played the serial killer acted well. He is the creepiest and most effective villain of the Department Q films."
" Last of the Department Q trilogy
",2017-04-23 00:00:00,5,"A CONSPIRACY OF FAITH is the last of the DEPARTMENT Q trilogy; these are Danish crime thrillers which are just as dark and gritty as THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. This one's all about religious themes, such as faith and fanatics, and once again there are grisly murders taking place for our leads to investigate. I found it a noticeable step down in quality from the previous entry in the series, lacking the pace and suspense that made the first two films more than watchable.This time around, the characters seem to be going through the motions without adding anything much in the way that's new. The gloomy atmosphere seems stronger than ever, sapping the film of life and sentiment, and there's a lot of wasted time in between the admittedly good set-pieces; the hospital sequence is a highlight here. At least the main cast members continue to give solid performances, with Fares Fares shining in particular."
" Department Q - A Conspiracy of Faith
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"This, the third of the 'Department Q' films opens with the discovery of a rather macabre letter in a bottle; analysis suggests it was written in blood several years ago by a child yet no children have been reported missing. The wording makes Carl and Assad think the writer must have been a member of a religious community and it isn't long before the writer is identified; it turns out that two brothers were kidnapped, one was murdered and the survivor is now a drug addict. Around the same time news emerges that somebody witnesses two children being abducted; they too are part of a religious community. They parents are initially against any police involvement as the kidnapper has said they will only get their children back if they pay a ransom and don't involve the police inevitably things will go wrong and many people will be in a lot of danger before the killer/kidnapper is found.People who have watched the previous 'Department Q' will know to expect some fairly disturbing scenes, some bloody and some involving children. The story is intriguing and leads naturally to some interesting conversations between Carl and Assad on the matter of faith; the former is convinced that religion is ridiculous the latter a Muslim. The identity of the kidnapper is know from the start; not just to the viewer but also to the parents of the kidnapped children of course he isn't easy to find as they don't know his real name and there is still the question of why he is doing it and whether the children can be saved. As expected Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Fares Fares do impressive jobs as Carl and Assad; the guest stars impress too; especially Pål Sverre Hagen who is distinctly disturbing as the kidnapper. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of dark Scandinavian drama, especially if you enjoyed the previous two films in the series."
" Sombre tones inhabit the latest Carl Mork police thriller...
",2017-03-21 00:00:00,8,"Sombre tones inhabit the latest Carl Mork police thriller, based on novels of Jussi Alder Olsen.There's none of the sparks of humour that lightened former films. This is a dark, sombre affair, that takes a child kidnapping and murder, investigation as its topic but also crosses over into child abuse, that has a religious context. I'd say I did not enjoy this film as much as its predecessor. By virtue of its subject matter, its inherently depressing and sad. I'd add, the story, for me, seemed a little convoluted at times, too. That's not to say this is a poor film. Its still impressive in many ways. The tone of the film is honest and down to earth. There is nothing at all pretentious or for that matter, judgmental, on offer here. It is what it is and its emotional impact, is all the greater, as a consequence. Personally I had a hard time watching this film. I could not say I enjoyed it because I didn't. That said its remarkable in its own way and should not be overlooked. Just be prepared to be upset and outraged in equal measure. Eight out of ten from me."
" Not my kind of fiction...
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,4,"I didn't watch it all. Only the beginning. Being a Jehovah's Witness myself, it started out really weird. We don't have ""fathers"", and we don't wear crosses, and we don't sing in white robes, yada yada yada... And what's with the no make up and no short hair??? My own hair is really short and so are a lot of my friends. And we dooo wear make up. It's ridiculous! Where did they get their information! ?! I know that the movie is not based on reality, but come on! People are going to believe this crazy stuff. Bummer..."
" Fantastic
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,10,"We just finished watching all three of the Department Q movies. They are all equally fantastic! We are at awe with the natural acting performance and the very exciting plots. We wished that we could speak Danish, but our vote still gets a 10 out of 10 with subtitles. Lately, we have been missing this kind of enjoyment from productions out of Hollywood, they definitely could learn lots from the European Team. We would love to hear, that they are planning to produce many more of the Department Q movie series and hopefully with the same crew. Because three plots, all different, but equally spell-binding, realistic, sometimes even funny, in their tension-relieving moments, makes it clear you have a winner of a writer, actors and all who made this show what it is kind of crew... You don't want them to stop and we beg them to produce many more of this amazing production. Thank you in advance"
" Solid kidnapping thriller
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,6,"Erlösung was an interesting watch. This thriller plays in Denmark and you see for once other pictures than in the usual Hollywood films of this genre. The story is promising but loses sometimes itself to stick criminal research elements together until the end. There are some flaws but if you can look away it works anyway for a solid thriller. I expected some harder punishment for the kidnapper that I want not to spoil more here. In other American kidnapping movies the killing scene of the bad guy is developed much more spectacular. If you liked it you should see Panic Room, Hostage, Trapped or The Call. You won't regret. In fact Erlösung is one part of a trilogy with the same actors. There are rumors that they will be filmed for a remake in Hollywood. So I think I wait to see the other two until they come out new again. 6/10."
" Major disappointment compared to first two films
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,3,"Keeper of Lost Causes is one my favourite films of all time. When I recently discovered the 2nd and 3rd films I could barely wait to see them.This one however did not live up to the production of the first two and I am amazed that no one else has called all the impossible, nonsense things the plot is dependent on and clichés galore. I'm sure I won't dissuade you from watching but the 2+ hours sure dragged for my partner and I.****Spoillers**** After cliché of kidnap victims not wanting cops involved (OK in the scheme of things) the father gets on a normal German EC train. Cut to the next scene and he's on an ICE express. Then it gets better as the baddie calls him and tells him to throw the money out of the train - so the Father just opens the door of a moving train doing 200+km/h - wth??? What train even allows a door to open without an emergency stop. Then he jumps out and is OK. Later in same scene cop gives chase and seemingly to drag the film out only rings in the ambulance call and doesn't put out an apb to the helicopter they have on the operation with a description of the car or license plate. Heavy sigh.Of course the killer is so confident he comes to get the father in hospital and it turns into keystone cops again.This film just lets down the other two and even now makes me want to eye roll. If in doubt think of the Department Q series as a two film series and not a trilogy. Painful."
