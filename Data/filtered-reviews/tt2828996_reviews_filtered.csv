" yeah... its fun....
",2020-09-28 00:00:00,7,Typical wayans spoof movie... best to watch with some alc..... but always enjoyable
" Why?
",2020-02-05 00:00:00,2,"So Haunted House 1 was really stupid and panned... and I guess they thought ""let's make the same movie again!""They do all the same jokes, even repeating scenes entirely. The same thing happens with his dog and he has the same flip-out. The same scene happens with the stuffed toy/doll in his bedroom. Again and again. Same jokes, same scenes, same lack of anything funny.Why did I subject myself to this movie... again?At least I didn't have to pay for it since it's on Netflix and all."
" Well
",2019-09-09 00:00:00,5,The first movie I loved thier jokes but this one is really a bad sequel
" This movie is really stupid but I still enjoy it
",2019-07-02 00:00:00,6,These type of movies are absolutely terrible but there still kinda funny and good in there own unique ways I love these absolutely terrible movies there's just something unique about them
" my notes
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,6,Pretty funny with some memorable and hysterical parts (2 viewings)
" Rush job sequel
",2019-06-19 00:00:00,2,"The original A Haunted House was apparently a surprise hit, so of course the studios green lit a sequel. And with a year later, this sequel comes out. The original film wasn't great but it had some funny and enjoyable moments.A Haunted House 2 is more over the top, with more and less funnier sexual and racial jokes. More jokes fell flat. This movie starts off okay but is relatively the same material, and it doesn't exactly go anywhere."
" Funny, but bad storyline.
",2019-03-15 00:00:00,6,"This movie is straight up hilarious, but the story is bad."
" MISS ME?
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,8,"Malcolm (Marlon Wayans) has moved on and married Megan (Jaime Pressly) who has a moody teen daughter (Ashley Rickards) and a son with an imaginary playmate. The haunting begins immediately as Malcolm has ""an affair"" with a haunted doll left behind from the previous owner, one that goes ""Fatal Attraction"" on him. Malcolm views home movies also left behind with the hanging people in the back yard and a guy who ""looks as ugly as Steve Tyler."" The daughter carries around a large found wooden box, which plays no other part than to be a source for crude box jokes.The film is similar in style and humor to the original, i.e. if you loved that one, you should love this one. I had a few LOL moments, including when the dog died...my bad. The film also has crude moments and explicit sex talk. Some knowledge of drugs is helpful. OG Kush is marijuana and Molly is ecstasy.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity, and squirting."
" Best Marlon Wayans movie yet had me Laughing for Days later Every Time I would think of it
",2017-12-05 00:00:00,9,"I have not been usually a fan of Marlon Wayans in movies. I loved his brother Damon and loved the family in sketch comedy in In Livin Color. But in Scary Movie I thought he over played his parts. So much that it wasn't funny. And White Chicks was only funny because of Terry Crews. In face the only Scary Movie I liked was the ""Grab my Little Hand"" one and the one with the Spoof genius Charley Sheen who dominated Hot Shots and Part Deux in a way that would make Monty Python or Mel Brooks proud. A Haunted House 1 fell short as well although some parts made me snicker. A HH2 though was pure genius. I can see a lot of people not getting the humor but I'm pretty sure anyone my age understood it perfectly. Us 90's kids grew up hearing these type laughs. From them moving in all the way to the Warrans I laughed and laughed out loud non-stop. I am definitely buying this and watching it until I wear it out and the humor isn't funny anymore. Give it a shot and don't worry about the plot. Just listen to Marlons take on women problems, and how he handles or should I say can't handle the paranormal. All stereotypes are touched just as the Great Dave Chappelle. Actually that is a perfect reference. If you liked the Dave Chapelle show and laughed hard at that, you'll love this. If not, then go watch CSI or How to Lose A Guy In 10 Days. You will be better off"
" Funny as Hell
",2017-07-05 00:00:00,7,"This is Marlon Wayans at his best! I loved 'White Chicks', but let's be honest: it was Terry Crews who made that film great. 'Little Man' was only funny for half of the movie and the 'Scary Movie' films are quite good, but the 'Haunted House' movies are the best.I laughed so hard, even with this sequel. The first one was the funniest, but this one comes close. Even the special effects are really good!I loved the spoofs on 'The Conjuring' and 'Annabelle' and so on. I did not like the too many sex jokes, but the rest of the movie makes it up.These two movies were surprisingly funny!"
" A take on every clich√© Horror film
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,10,"This movie will always be my favorite horror film, mostly because it mocks every single horror film in the book. It's not suppose to be serious, it's just suppose to be light hearted, stupid, and funny all together. It's a good take on a parody of every single horror film like Anabelle(the doll), Saw, The exorcist, paranormal activity, Insidious, etc. Some of these horror films are just down right stupid so it's refreshing to see a movie making fun of it. This show leaves off where his ex girlfriend, Kisha, was possessed by a demon and now he has a new girlfriend where he moves in with his children. There are many stereotypes in this film like the promiscuous daughter, weird son, psychotic doll, etc. This show just created a spoof on every horror film with putting down night 1 like in paranormal activity. There are many times where a doll (Anabelle) he ends up sleeping with and shows very dumb sex scenes that are actually pretty funny. It's very over dramatic at times. He wants to end up getting rid of the demon etc. this film is just downright stupid that it's funny and really just makes fun of horror films. They use stupid humor or even offensive humor but it always tends to make me laugh all the time. I can watch this 100 X's and still laugh."
" Decent
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,8,"For someone who really does not enjoy any sort of comedic movies at their best, I genuinely enjoyed this movie. I was laughing all throughout the movie, a lot of the humour was just too stupid not to laugh. This definitely isn't one of those solid comedic movies, however some of the jokes were pretty clever and well thought out. And coming from someone who loves horror movies with a passion and has seen the best and the worst of them, this movie did a good job of incorporating a lot of the big names into this movie and making fun of them with some playful humour. All in all, I would recommend this to anyone who is just looking for a dumb, funny movie to watch when you're bored scouring Netflix, especially if you are a horror movie fan like myself."
