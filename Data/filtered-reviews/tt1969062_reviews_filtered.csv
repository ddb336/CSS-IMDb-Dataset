" I'm definitely running in the opposite direction !
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,10,"Mark Ruffalo has pulled of so many masterpiece like this such as The begin again, Thank you for sharing and The kids are alright. I thinks he does most effortless acting on screen ever. Period. But this was so Involving Parenting movie that 'Feels Good' to the soul. I mean it has everything from being funny to dramatic to scary and really admitting to reality of separation, heartbreaks, all the sacrifices you make for your loved ones and knowing what makes the life worth suffering for. I give it a ten not just for good story but every character from kids and joe Saldana who perfectly played their part and challenged the protagonist of the story to bring out the best in him. This movie needs to be appreciated more than it deserve to be honest. With just uniquely similar feel to the movie captain Fantastic that explores around Quirky parenting, this movie is general depiction of every parent in midlife crisis. My take from it was to create small things in life that when i look back It puts a smile on my face."
" Best Father's Day Movie
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,10,I just don't know how to rate Rufallo's portrayal and acting in this movie. Is there something higher than 10? We'll watch this every year on Father's day. I loved the scene when they cried together.
" Great portrayals
",2019-09-06 00:00:00,7,This was a great portrayal of mental illness in mainstream society. Mark Ruffalo plays it well with sincerity.
" Best Portail of the Manic Side of Bipolar
",2019-04-14 00:00:00,10,"I watched this while in-patient in a behavioral health institution. It focused mostly on the mania which I appreciated because that side of the mood disorder is misconstrued in the few films about mental illness and the inside world of psychiatric facilities. There are some accuracies but more inaccuracies.
Mark Ruffallow was brilliant. Manic-Depression is difficult to diagnose due to the erratic changes in moods. Today's way of diagnosis is often based on little information. Assessments that do not have enough questions or specifics to conclude. I started showing symptoms around age 13, at first seeing a therapist for depression. It is much more difficult to be certain as a teenager, considering the already erratic moods many experience.
It was hard to watch at parts because I realised that what I was seeing was a lot like how I am seen. It was almost too relatable.
The overall story is heart wrenching, funny, unsettling and triumphant. A worth watching movie."
" Infinitely nice
",2018-11-22 00:00:00,9,"I almost watched this movie accidentally because it wasn't much promoted where I live, but I loved it!
Inspired by the life of Maya Forbes, this movie is a sincere, affectionate, love song to her complex dad who suffered bipolar disorder. The unique circumstances the little family experiences are also intertwined by the unique, for the time, circumstances of an interracial couple. Both the dad's psychological issues, as well as the struggles of the mixed family and the strong mother who sacrifices herself to try to get a better job and give her daughters a better life, are handled with sincerity and realism without coming across any clich√© and redundancy. Ruffalo makes a terrific impression as the dad who is a maniac depressive mess but he still is, to his core, an adorable and funny guy who loves his girls. The script doesn't make excuses for his stupid behavior but it makes you understand that he has an issue that, at the time, wasn't known very much about thus the doctors couldn't provide him the appropriate solutions that would help him. Everything is done with a lightness and heart that contrasts with the seriousness of the situation without underming it. The parental roles are reversed a bit when the daughters (played by talented young girls you will simply love) essentially have to babysit their own father a bit, after their mother (convincingly played by the lovely Zoe Saldana) trusted him to take care of them while she has no choice but leave home for a while to try to get a better job that would ensure the little girls a better future (than having to rely on a father who, due to his condition, cannot keep a job for too long).
Although you see less of her than the other characters, the mother too is an interesting character. She has faith in the guy in spite of their own marriage issues (you get the sense she is accepting his condition, but she also is realistic in that his behavior creates issues that cannot be simply resolved by them still loving each other).
I hope the career of this director will give her more chances to prove herself as I find she has a talent for telling honestly realistic stories that get you right in the feels without being pedantic (in spite of the themes she dealt with)."
" Moving and Hilarious
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,8,"As a father who has some (mild) emotional illness, watching Infinitely Polar Bear was a moving, uncomfortable, hilarious and lovely experience for me. Every performance is incredible, but Saldana's harsh honesty and unconditional love are heartbreaking in their perfectly broken kindness."
" ""Unhand My Foot!""
",2018-05-08 00:00:00,7,"Ruffalo is terrific as whimsical, child-like Cameron. In fact the whole cast is wonderful at carrying across this tale of family tensions and mental illness. Some great scenes and light-hearted dialogue make sure that it never gets serious for long. ""Unhand my foot!"""
" Sparkling like a star can be the real description this movie!
",2017-12-26 00:00:00,8,"Fantastic, real touch to feelings, one of the best way to feel the family spirit. And you can't stop your tears falling down while watching Mark Ruffalo.. Definitely one of the best movie that you can ever watch if you want to have a real emotional touch to your heart... Be ready to smile and cry at the most unexpected time..."
" uplifting, beautifully acted
",2017-12-11 00:00:00,10,"Mark Ruffalo stars in ""Infinitely Polar Bear"" along with Zoe Saldana, Imogene Wolodarsky, and Ashley Aufderheide, from 2014, directed by first-time director Maya Forbes. Forbes is a very talented woman I hope to be seeing more from as a director - she's already an established writer and producer.The story takes place in Boston in the late 1970s, where Cam Stuart (Ruffalo) lives with his wife Maggie (Saldana) and their children, Amelia and Faith.Cam is bipolar and job problems lead him to a nervous breakdown. He is institutionalized and then moved to a halfway house. Though he comes from a wealthy family, the money is in a trust. Maggie has a tough time making ends meet. She decides to get her MBA and wins a scholarship to Columbia. Cam is doing okay on lithium and is more on an even keel, so Maggie has him move in with the kids while she goes to New York for eighteen months, returning home on weekends. Her plan is to return to Boston after school and get a good job, which has eluded her thus far.It's a tough adjustment. The place is in disarray, Cam constantly embarrasses his kids for either being too friendly with the neighbors or hanging out with them and their friends, not to mention driving around in a pathetic car.What a wonderful movie told with such warmth and humor. The acting is wonderful all around. Both Ruffalo and Saldana are totally likable, and the kids are great - not cloying at all. The title comes from the kids misunderstanding the term ""bipolar.""Definitely worth viewing - a wonderful film."
" Shallow and Irritating
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,3,"(Flash Review)Ruffalo plays a bi-polar man who has two young kids with a mother and they battle trying to live as a single family unit. Living at around the poverty line, the mother decides to go to business school to support the family. Deciding to leave Ruffalo in charge of the kids during the week for several months. The director portrays the bi- polar man more as an eccentric and never really enlightens the viewer in depth on what it means to have such a condition. The scenes are overly similar when showing his eccentric interactions with his family and never really build to anything; felt very flat. I was like, OK, there he goes again doing something ridiculous. I guess the plot tension asked the question if he will be able to manage the kids and for how long and will he be able to manage his condition? I also didn't feel any of the characters connected with me as having genuine emotions for each other. This was not enjoyable."
" Solid 7, quite possibly close to an 8 star rating movie!
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,7,"First of all, how did they come up with the title? Was it based on a bi- 'polar' abnormality? Probably! I think this is an excellent movie depicting a family working through 'problems'. All families have some sort of 'problem' or 'challenge' that they either choose to stick with overcoming or give up on. This movie shows us how to relate to some of the problems that families undergo. I recommend this movie to anyone who might be struggling with mental disorders and disabilities because it's a daily and moment-by-moment 'emotional' battle for many in our world. Depression is very common and some people even die from it. What keeps us from that depression is a strong will to focus upon what makes us at our best 'happy' life? Many of us do not know where to put our focus, but if you want to be here in a body, you have to find ways to get through the emotional battles that plague us. This movie is a perfect example that will show you how a family can raise their children and still find some mental and emotional stability through it all. It's a great movie for 'dads' to see and take notice of how 'Mark Ruffalo' handles things. Many dads will resort to alcohol, but that only makes things worse for most because of the depression affect of alcohol. But during his episodes, he never hurts or harms the family, which is the best part of this movie in my honest opinion. I love it because of the 'real life' struggle that affect so many here on earth. Kudos to the writers and if this really was based on a true story by one of the writers, they should have let us know. I don't doubt that is WAS based on a true story, regardless of whether that was known or not."
" Beautiful Movie
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,6,"I just loved this movie. The movie is about a father who's suffering from manic depression and is trying hard to win back his wife's trust. Mark Ruffalo did a great job acting as manic depression suffering father. This movie really is a brilliant piece of art for me. I recommend this movie to everyone and watch this movie ones, you won't regret it."
" Gave me flashbacks
",2017-06-29 00:00:00,9,"I grew up with a manic-depressive father and this movie was spot-on. He wanted to hang around with my friends, he'd play games with me until I was worn out, he embarrassed me with his constant barrage of words-words-words. I knew he loved me and would do anything for me, but I also knew he couldn't be counted on to remember to pick me up at the movies.Certainly not all manic-depressives are the same, but there are some well-known patterns of thought and behavior, and this is a fine example of one of them."
" Heartwarming Film with Outstanding Performances
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,7,"In the late 70's, in Boston, the bipolar Cameron ""Cam"" Stuart (Mark Ruffalo) lives with his mulatto wife Maggie (Zoe Saldana) and their daughters Amelia (Imogene Wolodarsky) and Faith (Ashley Aufderheide) in an isolated house in the countryside. When Cam is fired from his job, he has a mental breakdown and Maggie is forced to institutionalize him. When he is released, he moves to a small apartment while Maggie works to support the children. She decides to apply to an MBA to improve her income and she is accepted by the Columbia University in New York. She asks Cam to take care of the girls for eighteen months and he agrees despite his fears. Maggie moves to New York and Cam is responsible for Amelia and Faith education. Will the scheme work?""Infinitely Polar Bear"" is a heartwarming film with outstanding performances. The dramatic situation of Cameron is shallow, but the movie is delightful to watch. Just as a curiosity, the girl Imogene Wolodarsky is the daughter of the director Maya Forbes. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sentimentos que Curam"" (""Feelings that Heel"")"
" Beary good, but not great!
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,8,"Novice Writer-Director Maya Forbes has made a touching film based on her family growing up; which features her bipolar-disorder diagnosed father. Forbes' ""Infinitely Polar Bear"" stars Mark Ruffalo as Cam Stuart, a bipolar man from Boston who has two young daughters and is currently semi-separated from his wife Maggie played by Zoe Saldana. When Maggie decides to flee to New York to pursue her Masters' Degree, Cam is left with the grandiose responsibility of taking care of his two daughters Amelia & Faith. Forbes hardly includes any huge dramatic scenes of the ill effects of bipolar disease in the picture. What she does include is the daily eccentricities of a man with a mental disease carrying task after task of caring for his daughters and all the challenges behind it. The only hiccup I have of this is that subtly Forbes does not incorporate much how horrific it is to live with a mental disease as bipolar disease, obsessive compulsive disorder, etc. Nevertheless, this film is really the vehicle of Mark Ruffalo, as he once again shines infinitely in a character. Mark has made his mark as one of the best actors working today. Zoe Saldana was very solid as Maggie. And Imogene Wolodarksy and Ashley Aufderheide were outstanding as respectively Amelia and Faith. So get on the Polar Express, and go infinitely to ""Infinitely Polar Bear"". **** Good"
" Lovely movie
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,10,"I didn't know what to expect, but I've loved Mark Ruffalo in almost every role, and have recently realized that Zoe Saldana is far more than the ""It"" girl I thought she was. My faith was rewarded. The two were magical in their chemistry with each other and the two delicious actresses who played their daughters. It's a film that reaches into your heart and pulls out the part that wants to hug someone. Perfectly wonderful sharing experience for middle schoolers and their parents."
" An excellent, must watch film
",2017-01-06 00:00:00,9,"If you love Mark Ruffalo--as I do--this is a must watch film. Everything is excellent: the story, script, casting, locations, costumes.... It is a rare find. I am a parent; I have friends and acquaintances with bipolar disorder. This film tackles those topics effectively and rings true on both fronts. The film is set in the late 1970s and touches on a variety of delicate subject matters for that era: class, wealth and poverty; mental disorders; biracial relationships; education and career opportunities for girls and women. And subjects matters that are still contentious today: disparity in public school districts; career opportunities for working mothers; effective parenting. Overall, this film is fascinating and I highly recommend it."
