" Great film
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,7,"Really nice movie. Great acting, good action, character development. The villain is basically an Italian Joker, he's terrifying! I would recommend this to anyone that likes good action and anti hero movies."
" Italian superhero
",2020-08-07 00:00:00,7,"GOOD. Italian ci-fi of a superhero. In reality, he is a type of anti-hero, a delinquent who lives on small urban crimes and who suddenly discovers he has supernatural powers. It somewhat resembles another character from American cinema and comic books: Deadpool. For those who have seen one of the Deadpool films, you will know what it is about. Perhaps it is a trend in modern cinema to create unconventional superhero stories, with satire, humor, irony, and sarcasm. The special effects are simple but suited to the purpose of the narrative. The story is interesting and entertaining. Like almost all superhero films, the film's events are forged by the author to match the narrative. It's a good movie for entertainment, which is what matters. I recommend."
" the small italian superhero movie that could.
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,7,"Enzo (Claudio Santamaria) is a small time petty thief who falls into a vat of chemicals and finds himself imbued with superhuman strength. Meanwhile the local hood boss Zingaro (devilishly well played by Luca Marinelli) finds himself obsessed with the new superhero and his crazed ambitions to infamy puts both hero and villain on a familiar collision course.This superhero origin story is given a local Italian flavour, and the result is an understated superhero film with layered characterizations: this makes the catharsis from the redemptive arc of our hero well earned. With the cosmic heroics of the Marvel stable overwhelming the cinematic landscape this past decade, it is a breath of fresh air to see a movie which does so well with just the basics of a well worn superhero story. Surprisingly good, down to earth and heartfelt to boot. Bravo."
" Jeeg Robot a Hero or Anti-hero?
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,7,"I love Italian movies and series because mostly are high quality products. Here we have a little pretty anti hero gem called Jeeg Robot.
First, the acting is quite good. Pretty raw and credible. Some familiar faces from Gomorrah.
Second, the cinematography and the FX's are pretty good. Not excessive CGI used. And last, the script was quite good. Some not predictable turns. So, overall a great little great gem again coming from Italy."
" Villany Personified
",2020-02-10 00:00:00,7,"I kept trying to skip past this one particular movie and landing back on it. So I said, well I guess I should maybe see it. And I was surprised that it was watchable. It was entitled They Call Me Jeeg. It was an Italian superhero movie, and it seemed like it was some kind of Batman/Riddler rendition. But the really cool thing was the guy playing The Riddler. He was a hambone unleashed and loved every minute of being really rotten. And he was really rotten. I give it 4 stars for him alone."
" What a great movie!
",2019-10-29 00:00:00,10,"Just go straight to the point. I love the scenes in which ""Zingaro"" Fabio Cannizzaro is involved, mainly those showed him singing. Great performance as well for Vincenzo, who played later Genny Sevastano in ""Gomorra"". Anyway an amazing movie about a real hero from the barrio, who gets great powers from toxic waste. I hoped this movie would be as successful abroad as it was in Italy, but I think you should live in Italy to understand all the matters involved."
" Weird
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,2,Found this movie on Amazon Prime and gave it a try. This movie is weird mostly because of the three main characters that all have their own sort of weirdness but not in a good way. I don't actually know what to think about this but I can say that I did not like it.2/10
" Beautiful
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,6,"Enzo (Claudio Santamaria) is a small-town crook in Rome, stealing purses and taking on small jobs with other crooks just to get by; after one such incident, he finds himself being chased by the cops and the only way to escape them is to jump into the Tiber River. Unfortunately for him, the place where he jumps conceals a number of barrels containing toxic waste, and one of them has been leaking. He suddenly finds himself with superpowers, and uses them to steal for"
" Excellent Move!
",2018-10-22 00:00:00,9,"What an Amazing experience, and it was not afraid of showing on the screen how ugly people we are. This was a rate treat and I can't recommend it enought. Incredible acting and unbelievable beautiful cinematography. I want to say this this on my top three films of all time."
" Slow, Boring and waste of time!!!
",2018-02-07 00:00:00,3,"I only watched this movie due to 7/10 ratings.
Very rarely I don't agree with the ratings on IMDB.
It seems like the story was all over the place.
They wanted to make a superhero type of movie but they
did almost same thing which has been done 1000 times before. 
Nothing new Nothing special. Movie got so boring after the first
half that I kept forwarding it thinking it might get better but it didnt.
Nothing worked for this movie, Can not come up with anything positive
about the movie!!!!"
" This film is unfathomably boring
",2018-01-01 00:00:00,2,"I've never wanted to put in the effort to review any films before, but this film, despite everything it could be, is plain, and dull, i'm not asking for DC or MARVEL here but jeez, dude gets superpowers and he's like, oh... huh.. then the movie proceeds to do nothing with it for 50 minutes. i get that this is supposed to be a reflection of reality, but i dont suspend my disbelief just to watch something boring."
" Terrific Movie
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,10,"As some other reviewers have stated, they took a lot of what has become tired and tedious in our current super hero movies, thrown it out, and done something nice and fresh (as much as can be done with a superhero movie anyway).Real issues, real people, real concern for the characters. You see movies like this and wonder why our current American producers in Hollywood can't seem to find an original story, director, or thought.I swear, it's gotta be drugs."
" Review: ""They Call Me Jeeg"" By Sombrero
",2017-10-07 00:00:00,8,"Well, one year after his release I finally watch ""They Call Me Jeeg"". I had great expectations for this movie, and most of it was met. This movie tell the story of a ""superhero"" produced in Italy and directed and interpreted by Italian director and actors,who have become accustomed to the usual ""cine-panettoni"", I can call it a ""small masterpiece"". Of course, it is not perfect, in fact in some points the acting (in some cases), the accuracy of certain details, the characterization of some characters and the audio of the movie(although, all in all, in a few moments). Finally, after seeing 1173 movies in my life, I think I can say that this movie deserves a lot, considering also Gabriele Mainetti's still not have many experiences as a director. So I suggest to all those who have lost it to dedicate 1: 52h of their time. Thanks for reading and regards from Sombrero."
" My 3rd Italian film, my 3rd hit. Not your conventional Hollywood type hero, but better.
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,9,"Oh my, just when I thought I see it all, another hidden gem surprises me. This movie has everything, and even when I think I will never see a more controversial relationship between two main characters since ""Leon, The Professional"", Enzo and Alessia appear. A weird movie, with a rare plot, but I need to say that better than a lot of American superheros movies that saturate the cinematography year by year these days. Just hope this will not be just a one hit wonder and the director continue these franchise because they could have a future if they make the right moves. A sad story, with a non-conventional approach, for be ""a superhero movie"", but that is well executed and will take a place between my favorite films outside of Hollywood. Great work!!!!"
" Italy just got its first superhero movie...
",2017-06-15 00:00:00,8,"Italy just got its first superhero movie, a crook satisfied with his loneliness and who doesn't care for his health. He is not your typical hero, actually he starts his superhero career with the stealing of an ATM. Clearly, this genre is not common in the Italian cinema, but the director and the writers did a pretty good job. They adapted the concept of a hero in the city of Rome (which I think it's a first), gave him a super-villain to fight and a lunatic girl to take care of, in order to discover his true self and use his powers for the greater good. Unlike Hancock, whose vice is alcohol, Enzo loves yogurt. After he steals money, he fills his fridge with a lot of yogurt. He is also a pervert who constantly watches porn. Despite all his vices, the world he lives in is not better than him. Terrorist attacks, gang related kills and a lot of people who appear to be indifferent with the world they live in. There are some similarities between Kick-Ass and this film, especially the part where Zingaro assaults the Camorra clan on some Italian pop song. Hit-Girl does the same with some thugs, only she does it on punk rock. Of course the movie has some weaknesses. The plot seems a little straightforward, maybe because they aren't looking for a sequel. Could have been a little funnier, but I think the director wanted the hero to remain in a dark side. The scene when he tried to put his toe back made me laugh. (Deadpool would make fun of him). I think the Italians should make more films like this, they are obviously going on the right track. Hollywood should take some notes from foreign films. I recommend this film even if you know from the beginning how it will end, the cast makes sure you will have fun and be thrilled by their good performance."
" If you have a good idea ...
",2017-05-18 00:00:00,9,"Go with it! Actually run with it would be better. And the filmmaker of this one did exactly that. It's always about the money, although you couldn't tell the budget for this one, because the mind goes a long way. And they really though of something that while it may not be unique, it very much feels like it is. And that alone is worth more than a really big budget.So if you are open minded and like weird Indie movies, you will have the time of your life with this one. It's our anti-hero who's carrying this, but also the female lead who's helping a lot (maybe not always literally but you get the point). It may feel creepy or wrong at times, but that just goes to show you, that the movie is rough on the edges. And it's refreshing that it doesn't seem to mind about correctness one way or another. One of the best Fantasy movies in the last couple of years - and who said Italy couldn't do any Genre movies anymore?"
" Marvel and DC could learn from this wonderful deconstruction
",2017-05-06 00:00:00,8,"Here is a backstory you will not find in a comic book, but likely deserves one anyway.A non-traditional director does a superhero film in Italy (believed to the first ever) and sets it against a backdrop of actual themes and events and social issues well known to those who live there.Unlike Marvel and DC, who are fighting each other to the death in an insane crusade to monetize every last story, treatment, and dust bunny in their respective archives, director Mainetti took what he needed from the superhero mythology and threw the rest out.The mere fact that this movie does not care about a sequel or a franchise or a merchandising spin off gives it instant points in my book.When you look closely at it, and see solid writing, good performances, and even a ""tragic romance"" as good as anything from a daytime soap, you realize that we have something very special here.Recommended."
" A matter of inner transformation
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,7,"Set in Rome, this film follows the stories of two men living in the suburbs. Enzo, the hero, reincarnates the classic criminal who has nothing worth to lose. His only satisfaction left, are his habits, which are pretty pathetic. Enzo doesn't care about anything, health, nutrition or social relationships. He doesn't even care much about money, as his profession would suggest. He is not the person that asks too much when he is offered a new job. Enzo seems comfortable with his loneliness. He is nothing you would expect a superhero to be like, even before owning superpowers.On the other side, Zingaro, the villain. He is not the classic megalomaniac and lunatic villain, who aims to own the world. Zingaro works with a few guys, looking for the upper step in the criminal context of Rome. As seen in many gangster movies, Zingaro plays the unofficial leader, who always tries to show his madness and pretends respect, sometimes in a pretty crazy way.The main difference between these two characters are their aspirations. While Enzo looks for a monotonous low-level criminal life to afford his pleasures: eating yogurt and watching porn movies, Zingaro looks for his position in the top gangsters of Rome.What excited me about this movie is the missing superhero-classic transformation of Enzo when he gains superpowers. While you would expect Enzo to become a people-caring superhero, he remains in his dark habitat and steals for him. In fact, the first thing he does when he figures out what he is capable of, is literally stealing an ATM. The only transformation is not caused by his superpowers, but by Alessia, a lunatic girl who lives in her fantastic world and has an enormous passion for the Japanese anime Steel Jeeg. Thanks to her, Enzo discovers the meaning of taking care of another person. He discovers love. Even if he know that Alessia has some mind-related problems, he doesn't feel any pity. When Alessia dies, he doesn't look for any revenge. Instead he tries to follow Alessia's dreams: being a superhero, just like Steel Jeeg. This will lead him to battle Zingaro, who earned the same superpowers Enzo owns. While Zingaro offers him a criminal partnership (something he have already seen in Spiderman - 2002), Enzo changed. He doesn't want to be a bad person anymore and fights Zingaro until the end."
" a competent genre piece, might not be innovative as we wanted it to be
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,7,"An superhero iteration from Italian cinema, THEY CALL ME JEEG is director debut from Gabriele Mainetti. Our reluctant hero is a small-time criminal Enzo (Santamaria), who gains superhuman strength after falling into a barrel of radioactive waste in the Tiber river when chased by police in the snappy opening sequence. The story might be transposed to a new location, Rome's seedy outskirt where criminal act runs rampant, yet the narrative structure is more or less commonplace like its many a predecessor, Enzo must adhere to the same road-to-redemption drill to voluntarily take on his responsibility of helping those who are in extremis, although the first thing occurring to Enzo's mind is to rob an ATM machine once he has realized what he is capable of doing. (Btw, ATM machine will automatically deface the notes with ink once it is opened by force, everyday, you live and learn!)It is interesting to posit Enzo as a misanthropic deadbeat, feeding off from pornography and self- loathing, so he needs a conduit to lead him to wear that mask and cape, and here comes Alessia (Pastorelli, a screen debutante), the mentally impaired girl living downstairs with her father Sergio (Ambrogi), she is possessed with the popular Japanese manga STEEL JEEG and insists that Enzo is the incarnation of its hero Hiroshi Shiba. A dissonance occurs when we realize Enzo and Sergio are acquaintance-in-crimes, yet, the way the film introduces Enzo to Alessia gives us the impression that they just know each other for the first time. When Sergio is dispatched by a drug mule, the story predictably binds Enzo and Alessia together, and piles on woeful back-stories to the damsel- in-distress in order to attain sympathy, both from Enzo and audience,the result is 50/50. The problem is that Alessia, played with verve by Pastorelli nonetheless, vacillates in her personalities at the convenience of the plot, she appears to be obtuse enough to bury herself in her infantile fantasy (all she wants is a princess dress) so as not to question the fount of Enzo's superpower and just play along, in other occasions, lucid enough to invigorate Enzo's sense of justice and affection, not to mention gallantly stabbing her kidnapper at a critical moment. So what is the real deal of her? We would never get a full picture since she has one last mission to perform - a dramatic exit to kick-start our hero's conscience.The chief villain here is Zingaro aka. the Gypsy, a crazed psychopath play by Marinelli, the alumnus from Saverio Costanzo's THE SOLITUDE OF PRIME NUMBERS (2010), with unbridled bravado, to counter Enzo's more muted personality. Taking reference from today's spiked fame from YouTube and reality show, the Gypsy has a maniacal hunger for fame,and blatantly takes a leaf out of the Joker's book, the pomp of wanton volatility and cartoonish grandstanding is duly underlay, only to be undermined in the eleventh hour by the much hyped blast, betrays that the movie's budget runs out quickly. Also, it is hardly not to notice, theoretically, our hero's nemesis could fall upon the shoulders of the equally cold-blooded alpha gangster Nunzia (Truppo), but as often as not, there is still no room for women to break that glass ceiling as far as superhero fares are concerned. At any rate, THEY CALL ME JEEG is to say the least, a competent genre piece, might not be innovative as we wanted it to be, yet, it at least plays up the pipe dream from a worm's eye-view, an ordinary type who is endowed with something extraordinary, still gets a rueful sigh when he finds out the rehabilitation of a chopped pinkie toe is just his wishful thinking."
" bad movie, bad plot and bad actors!!!!
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,4,"I'm Italian and as almost all of Italian movies i saw were garbage wasn't so happy to watch this movie. after a while i decided to give it a try and i was really disappointed. how the hell could they get the right to put a jeeg robot name into it really confuse me. it would be a bit better if they put hiroshi shiba in the name instead of jeeg robot. the female actress is a big brother person so what can u expect from that? for sure not good acting as a movie should get to raise their enjoying for public. about the story of the movie they put many rude things into it like porn magazine, drugs, raped person and so on to make the movie darker, but that's not what i was expecting with that name. i heard some friends who liked that movie, and many others who don't. if u like transformers and u watch transformers movie , they are OK since they are all about transformers + good story + good special effect and good actors. just watched once and I'm enough with it."
