" Terrifying
",2021-04-10 00:00:00,8,"Neerja... the courage of a lion against Pakistani cowardly terroristsThis is a must watch film for anyone who believes in doing what is right no matter what.Granted those events occurred in the mid 1980's, but even today Pakistan has prided itself on being the terrorist hotbed capital of the world. It's simply astonishing that civilised countries allow travel to and from it. That It protected Osama Bin Laden is proof enough that Pakistan isn't intellectually developed enough to be considered a country that belongs to the greater global community.She died unnecessarily and Pakistan is responsible for not just hers, but millions of other murders."
" Watch it for the braveheart Neerja Bhanot.
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,8,"Neerja review :Going for the sunday evening show after reading the generally positive reviews from fellow critics and friends, I had high expectations from Neerja. Sometimes, that can lead to bigger disappointment if the film falls short even marginally.Thankfully, Neerja has been one of my most satisfying outing at the movies this year. And the full credit for that goes to Adman turned filmmaker Ram Madhvani. Truly, the director deserves a standing applause. Here's why:First, for choosing to tell and celebrate Neerja Bhanot's bravery under adversity tale. She was a part time model and head purser of the ill - fated Pan Am 73 flight which was hijacked in Karachi by four Palestinian terrorists. Displaying exceptional courage and presence of mind, Neerja managed to save lives of 359 out of 379 people on board but sacrificed her own in doing so.Second, for taking the big risk of casting an otherwise supremely untalented actor in the lead role and then cleverly reining her in. Though any other experienced actor would have taken Neerja to an altogether different high, Madhvani has successfully utilised Sonam Kapoor's innocent face and resemblance to Neerja more than her acting chops and actually extracted a restrained performance out from her. Bravo!Third, for choosing the right team of scriptwriter, technicians and supporting cast for his second feature film after 'Let's Talk' (2002).
Neerja's positive points include an effective screenplay (Saiwyn Quadras) and a super gripping narrative. The hostage situation itself, is portrayed so realistically; you feel being a part of it witnessing the brutal terror unleash even as Neerja tries to help in her own way - whether by hiding American passports or negotiating with the hijackers to provide food and water to her hapless passengers. Moreover, the frustrations and inter-turmoil between the terrorists is also interestingly handled. At one point, one of the terrorists (Jim Sarbh, impressive) literally growls and smashes the pantry items to vent his anger. It's a chilling moment! There are many such and they all add up to a highly engaging drama steeped in realism.The intercuts, first - the terrorists preparing bombs in Karachi while Neerja hosts her colony gathering at Navjeevan society, Bombay (which, by the way, is a stone throw away from my residence in Mahim) and later - Neerja's past demons of abusive marriage intercutting her present hostage crisis, are perfectly edited.Of the supporting cast, Shabana Azmi is outstanding even though her role is somewhat sketchy (premonition before the hijack looks too Nirupa Royish!!!). Yogendra Tiku equally impresses as Neerja's doting father. The scene where he telephones his wife to break the hijack news is simply awesome.And last but certainly not the least, for keeping the pace fast and emotions real and soul stirring.This is basically Ram Madhvani's glory as much as it is Neerja's.I strongly recommend a visit to the plex with friends and family as a tribute to the braveheart Indian who sacrificed her life for humanity. We owe it to her!Regards,
Sumeet Nadkarni."
" A fact of Life.
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,10,"Salam India,Salam Neerja🇮🇳🇮🇳.Love you courage.You should have to watch the movie"
" Ram Madhvani rocks in Neerja!!!!🤘🤘🤘
",2020-11-17 00:00:00,10,"The hero of this film is director,ram madhvani. he has directed this film with a class and decency that you will lost in the film for 2 hours.
Shabana azmi did an amazing job. Also, Sonam Kapoor was very good at her place. The music,BGM, cinematography was also awesome and the central attraction is the climax of the movie that will warm your heart. This is the magic that has been created by ram madhvani. He is a revolutionary director who can redefine Indian cinema.
He should made more movies..."
" Grand Salute to Neerja and her biopic! Life has to be bigger not longer!
",2020-11-06 00:00:00,10,"The film, Neerja is a portrayal on the life of the courageous Neerja Bhanot, who sacrificed her life while protecting the lives of 359 passengers in 1986. The flight was hijacked by a terrorist organization in Karachi. How she bravely handled the situation is what the film has been made on.Director is the real hero of this movie. Ram Madhvani describes every part, every scene of the film very wonderfully. Along with the writers, he is not giving outside of the track and thus, this film is a gem of 2016! Shabana Azmi has done a fantabulous job in the character of Neerja's mother. Though, she has not much dialogues, but her expressions show her emotions, and they are very real that everyone was crying literally. When she gave a speech on Neerja in the end, I was not able to control my emotions. Tears were flowing continuously. She will be the winner of best supporting actress in the major award ceremony undoubtedly.Sonam Kapoor has given career best performance. She could've been portrayed her well. But, whatever she has given is acceptable. Yogendra Tikku as Neerja's father and Shekhar as Neerja's friend are good and suitable. The man who portrayed Khalil, the angriest terrorist, has done a fantastic job. He looks like a pure terrorist. Others are good, too.Music is given by Vishal Khurana and lyrics has been penned by Prasoon Joshi. All the songs are listenable again and again. Background score is also suitable and helps to build the terror as well as the excitement.Connection with Rajesh Khanna, Neerja's past describing her marriage issue, her father's advises, her handling of the passengers, her smartness of not taking the U.S. citizens' passports, her calmness, her love letter written by her lover, her love towards her duty, her sacrifice - everything is just so perfect. I'm no getting over from it. This is probably one of the best films of this year.I salute you from the bottom of my heart to Neerja Bhanot, the actual one. She has been rewarded Ashok Chakra by the government of India. Though, Airlift was a good one, but, this deserves support from the audience. This is definitely better than Airlift. Please, it's my humble request to all that go and watch out the story of the brave girl, Neerja. Her mother told that Neerja was prettier than Sonam. Yes, the photographs in the end credits give the approval to this statement. A girl, aged 23, lost her life while saving the passengers during her job. Watch it and think that where we reached till now! Massive respect!"
" Poor acting
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,5,Movie was good but the acting done by Sonam Kapoor was too bad to bear.
" Sonam and neerja paradox
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,5,"5 stars to the movie 0 to sonam kapoor,it was a documentary of a valiant and gallant girl who remained loyal to her job till her last breath it's disappointing to see a devastating actor doing this kind of a movie to help her career bloom again she destroyed this masterpiece and it could have been better."
" Life has to be bigger, not longer
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,9,"The story of Neerja Bhanot is one of courage in the face of grave danger. It is a story that needed to be told and should have been told much earlier. Sonam's acting capabilities will surely be silenced by her portrayal of Neerja. But there is room for improvement. Neerja epitomizes professionalism. There are moments in the second half where the plot seems to drag. But the climax is powerful and makes up for that. Very touchy scene in which she reads out a letter by her abusive husband. Azmi, gave a knock-out performance as Bhanot's mother. With hardly any sign of self-indulgence, Sonam gives a solid performance. Good screenplay by Saiwyn Quadras. Excellent direction by Directed Ram Madhvani. Much much better than Mary kom.""A fact of life we all die. But the positive impact you have on others will be a living legacy. Catherine Pulsifer."
" Isalam not terrorism
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,1,"There is no relation between Islam and terrorism.
Don't put every ugly things on Islam or muslims.
Growing up plz"
" I legit cried at the end
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,10,"It's very hard to make me cry and this movie succeeded in it. It's not only about a terrorist attack, but also women empowerment, patriotism and generousity. Idk i'll say this, but sonam kapoor did a good job. I mean, her acting is on the balanced side, neither too dull nor tok melodramatic. So, people complaining and ranting bout her must get a life. But, those who stole the show was Jim Sarbh and Shabana Azmi. Shabana's speech at the end made literally made me emotional. As for flaws, i didn't find any, so it's undoubtedly a 10/10 for me :)"

" Real Heroine
",2019-09-06 00:00:00,10,My big wholehearted melting inspirational movie loved it soo.. much Thank you to all team
" My Review!
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,8,"First of all, huge respect and salute to Neerja Bhanot. An inspiration for self respect and bravery. Thanks to the director and story hunters, without whom we wouldn't have known such a brave soul existed. A big thumbs down to all the news reporters, for carrying on the flag of ""Spoiler Alert"". Seriously you guys are fit for nothing. It's only because of you guys i knew what the ending was. Really, PATHETIC.This is a big break for Sonam Kapoor. I keep hearing from the ladies around, that she is a perfect model but an actor? nah! But she did well. Impressed. Not sure if anyone else could've done this role. As a movie, this was a big draggy, slow and sometimes really inspiring. Hey, it's based on a true story and true stories tend to get a bit boring at times but it's worth a watch.Peace Out!"
" Good to have in Bollywood
",2019-04-11 00:00:00,6,"After the recent disappointments by the Bollywood handling of the real life brave hearts, this movie is a glimmer of hope that with least melodrama, a sensible biopic can be made. While the movie isn't technically(detailed depiction of events, focus on different aspects of the situation) profound, the sincere efforts of the cast, the music composer(Vishal Khurana does make a mark !), and a sober and humble screenplay leave positive impression. As always is the case with such movies, the common man is agonized at the near- impunity which the system grants to malignant elements like terrorists ! Certainly recommend ..."
" very intense biographical thriller
",2019-03-23 00:00:00,8,"A suspenseful, inspiring hostage thriller based on the actions of real life hero Neerja Bhanot (Sonam Kapoor), a flight attendant on a Pan-Am jet. The director engrosses us thoroughly by amalgamating its tense and emotional elements. Neerja's personal life was also interspersed throughout the film which portrayed her character as a grounded person and allows the audience to relate to her struggles. Incredibly effective. And affecting."
" Aapki belidan ko pernam
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,7,Good casting. Sonam jee really looks like neerja..
" Great story but very poor acting
",2018-10-23 00:00:00,2,It's a great plot to make a movie but where director went wrong was when he decided to give the lead role to Sonam Kapoor. She is very poorly suited for such a strong character and needless to mention her poor acting skills in all of her films
" A story strongly held by the performances of the actors
",2018-05-01 00:00:00,10,"This movie is based on the final moments of a model cum air hostess Neerja Bhanot, where she died on a hijacked plane in an attempt to save the passengers. Although many people watching this movie know the final outcome, the scenes beautifully powered by Sonam Kapoor and Shabana Azmi are a treat to watch. The moments especially focusing on Shabana Azmi and her attempt to keep hope in times of despair are gut wrenching and will definitely leave you in tears. The story stays true to the real life, with no extra melodrama and no unnecessary song sequences. This movie, unlike many other stories, does not specify from the beginning that Neerja was a brave girl. We are with her when she is frantic, when she is remembering moments from her past abusive marriage. We see her develop as a character. Majority of the film takes place in the plane and none of the scenes appear to be wasted. One particular scene where Neerja locks herself in the bathroom of the plane after a certain tragic incident is beautifully shot. The director and the cameramen skilfully compare the abusive husband with the terrorist and slowly Sonam gathers courage. Honestly, I am not a big Sonam Kapoor fan. I have watched some of her movies and the only movie that I liked her in was Raanjhana. But in this movie, she acts literally from every pore of her body. She pulls off scenes involving intense emotions and scenes with some respite with utter grace. We get a good ensemble of large supporting cast in terms of passengers and Neerja's family. This is a film which will definitely make you teary eyed."
" Straight away 10.
",2018-03-07 00:00:00,10,"One of the best movies of Bollywood. I have watched it several times since its release in 2016. But even on today, 2018, I have specially come on this page to write this review. It is so good."
" One of the best!!
",2017-11-11 00:00:00,10,This gave me tears!What a brilliant movie! Excellent BIOPIC. Hindi movie at its best. nice story line. . . . looking forward to watch these kind movies. i watched this like 5 times! Hats off to the all the crew. you cant keep your eye s off!
" Most Inspiring character
",2017-09-16 00:00:00,9,"A must watch movie for all, specially in this selfish world!! Neerja Bhanot, the youngest recipient of Ashok Chakra is the most inspiring character that I have heard in my life. She dedicated her life for some people she hardly knew which is most uncommon thing in this world for a normal middle-class person. The movie beautifully depicts her as a fun-loving and a charming person, full of life and love. Despite of the hardships she faced in her life she overcomes them with support of an amazing family. I loved the family bonding, the understanding and the caring and nourishing circle that the parents provide to their children. Character of Neerja cannot be made without having a family like she had. There are soldiers that lay down their lives for people. A great saute to all of them. They are trained to do so for years and they are made ready for this. Then there are people like Neerja. She was never trained in her life to do the act that she did and never in her dreams she would have thought about it. Her dream would have been to become a successful person in her profession, lead a comfortable life etc. which is what we all ordinary people wish for. But when the moment came, she didn't turn back thinking about the comforts of life and pushing the responsibility on others. I want to write so much more....... My greatest salute to Neerja from deepest point of my heart!!!"
" Impressive Biopic after two and Have decade of incidence
",2017-09-09 00:00:00,6,"A review on a biopic has two separate aspects to deal with. Firstly, to scan it as a movie and secondly how dramatically the production house could portray the real story.As far as movie is concerned it doesn't have quite notable artistic work right from beginning to the climax. The DOP and other team could have upgraded it by introspecting on it in more depth.As far as characterizing the story of Neerja is concerned, movie gives an impression that only the objective to tell the story of Neerja Could be achieved in a very simple manner. It is not giving a sense of inspiration to fellow air-hostess professionals across the globe. The performance of Hijackers is not up to the mark and it is not giving a sense of threat to the spectators that passengers would experience."
" A well-done biopic! Probably the best one till date.
",2017-09-02 00:00:00,10,"Sonam Kapoor's NEERJA is a movie worth watching. With an amazing Sonam as Neerja and Shabana Ji as her mother the movie chronicles the hijack of Pan Am flight in 1986. The overall texture of the film is unique with well-placed flashbacks trying to underline the struggles of the 22 years old brave heart. The very subtle and well adjusted camera movements compel tension to pour up when required. There are numerous scenes that will give you adrenaline rush while some will un-failingly leave you teary eyed. The best of all the is the 'relation between a mother and a daughter' that is in fact, the theme of the movie besides the brave tale. Shabana Azmi as Neerja's mother is beautifully real. Other actors specially the one who plays Khalil are worth appreciating. Sonam does the best work of her career in this unique masterpiece. She's genuine and worth loving. Highly recommended. My rating : ✴️✴️✴️✴️✴️ (5/5)"
" Great story but bad direction
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,3,"I'm compelled to write this review for the movie Neerja. This is a mockery. It fails in every aspect of narration. I do realize that Indians have this 'adjustment' mentality but this piece has the ability to push even an Indian beyond his adjustment tolerance.Worst possible direction for such an epic story and casting is poorest to honest. The extras are horrible in the movie. They are neither interested in active story nor there was any effort made to groom them for the scene.Screenplay is the real buzz kill. It switches to personal story from a high point hijack scene at an abrupt point, it kills all the moment gained so far. And fails to push the movie back to similar pace.I hardly remember listening to any soundtrack or music score. Such an emotional roller coaster movie subject with thrilling scenes and music doesn't make slightest attempt to harness those situations. An utter failure from music point of view.Shabana Azmi tries to steer the entire movie with her performance alone. And the rest of the crew fails to do justice. She must credited for being the only scorer here for the movie.And I'm very particular about cinematography and this had the worst cinematography one can imagine. Eye of the movie never attempts to make me feel the situation they are in. It was supposed to teleport me inside the plane but the plane was where it was. Never connected with the story.There are specific scenes which could've been emphasized even more because they form the load bearing actions of the movie."
" Good solid effort
",2017-07-24 00:00:00,8,"OK some of the characters are one-dimensional. And honestly for those of us who speak Arabic, the Arabic ""spoken"" by the terrorists was grating. ""Akhu-ee"" meaning ""my brother"" came out as ""ahoy"". If you are going to make a film, please employ actors who actually can speak the language or can learn how to do so. Otherwise this is a solid film. Well-paced, well-acted and reliable in terms of its commitment to historical accuracy. I found it particularly touching in the ways that Neerja's childhood and youth are contrasted with her circumstances on board the hijacked plane. Sonam Kapoor, Shabana Azmi and actor playing the father give very good performances."
" One of the best biopics to come from Bollywood
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,9,"Such a brave story about one of the bravest daughter of India. The narrative of the movie is successful in its purpose to left people with tears. Director Ram Madhvani has made the movie quite intelligently , he constantly pinches the narrative back and forth i.e present and flashbacks so that we root for Bertha and feel bad for her, and he is successful in it . Now let's talk about technicalities.. Screenplay- Screenplay is solid and tight but the climax is slightly stretched. Ram Madhvani mainly focused on the hijack incident but he also kept showing us about Neerja's private life cleverly by flashbacks at right moments.Acting performance- Sonam Kapoor was convincing in the titular character. Shabana Azmi once again proved why she's credited as the goddess of acting, every time she was on screen she made me feel what her character was feeling. Yogendra Tiku was as usual good , but this actor is getting type-casted. Abrar Zahoor was fine as the terrorist's leader. Shekhar was alright in his limited screen time. But the actor who clearly stood out was Jim Sarbh. He was way too real as the maniac terrorist. Every time he was on screen I was terrified that will this crazy do next. His Khalil was unpredictable , ambitious and terrifying at the same time, his performance literally uplifts the movie. Music-In a movie like this I feel there is no much scope for music , but music and background scores were alright, but one song in the second half seemed unnecessary. Direction- Direction was topnotch. Madhvani has done complete justice to the movie,and this guy knows how to get the best out of his actors, he cleverly .Overall the movie is inspirational,brave and earnest at the same time. It's a must watch for every Indian"
" One of the worst movies I've ever seen!
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,1,"I genuinely cannot comprehend how so many people gave this film positive reviews. It was an utter and absolute disaster! Where to even start?! Let's make a list, in no particular order and def not a 'complete' list either:* The ADR on this film (dialogue replacement done in a studio after the film is shot) is an utter disaster. Voices don't match the lips half the time, not mentioning the horribly flat and emotionless delivery. It's plain irritating. They shot 95% on closed set - why not record location audio?! Student films do better than that!* Script - slooow, dull, incredibly boring, cheesy, simply bad writing. So many terrible clichés, so many waaaay-over-the-top moments; half the time you just wanna laugh during scenes which try waaay too hard to appear dramatic.* Cardboard cutout characters - there's no development. Bad guys are simply 'bad' and have zero depth to them. ""Good girl"" is simply 'good' and while some effort has been made to develop her - the trivial, over-the-top flashbacks to her backstory are so clichéd you simply can't for a single second see her as a real person. (all the more embarrassing when the movie is based on a real person!)* Music - uggh! Over the top, cheesy and zero subtlety. The director's knowledge of filmmaking seems to focus here on the idea that ""if i play cheesy happy music, my audience will be happy and if i play sad music, everyone will be sad"". Instead of building emotion within the scene, he just plays an annoying, out of place melody and considers the job done. Waaay distracting, way frustrating.* Acting - awful! In their defense, even best actors couldn't save such a disaster of a film from sinking - but the cast of this film didn't even seem to try...* The background cast (extras) - in a film which features so many of its extras in roles closer to 'supporting characters' why do NONE of them seem to have any acting skills at all?* Those cheesy melodic/dancy sequences intercut here and there with tense action - simply laughable! You just can't take them seriously! I mean - when the film got halfway through, i half expected everybody on the plane, good or bad, to suddenly get up and break into a dance, cheerfully singing Jai Ho...The film was painful to watch, a complete disaster, one of the absolute WORST movies I've seen in a looong time. ZERO redeeming qualities. Does NOT deserve the one star i have to give it. Not a single word of positive feedback i could offer."
" Inspiring movie Sonam's rare performance
",2017-02-22 00:00:00,10,"I think this is the best movie I have ever seen. Sonam Kapoor left the comfort zone of romantic movie , it's her career best performance till now.Shabana G makes me so emotional at that moment but give a strong message to all.Indian cinema awaken us of real heroes of past and give us inspiration.Watch the real stories not reel."
" Sonam Kapoor is excellent in an inspiring thriller
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,8,"Neerja Bhanot, a young purser, gave her life in her attempt to save the lives of many dozens of passengers on board Pan Am Flight 73, which was hijacked by terrorists in September 1986. In so doing, she became a national symbol of bravery and heroism. Her story is well documented in this taut, inspiring and heart-touching thriller, which keeps its viewers on the edge of their seats as they witness this female hero fight for the lives of all those passengers who were forced to sit still and watch the atrocity of the four terrorists. Sonam Kapoor is the main lead here, and she makes the best of what many actresses would consider a dream role. This is clearly her best part, and she is very strong in her portrayal of Neerja's selfless bravery on board, as well as her steadfast determination not to succumb to societal mores in her personal life.The story develops at a fast pace, and is spite of its proceedings being well-known to all, the audience still wishes for a different outcome. Due credit for this would go to the direction, which combines elements of a suspenseful thriller and a strong human drama. It is the ending, however, which is a little too sentimental, but there it's Shabana Azmi's turn to shine and she does as usual. One cannot but feel for this woman and her daughter, but it's always inspiring to see how the sacrifice of Neerja, just as noted in the film, manages to immortalize her, so much that thirty years later a film is produced in her memory, and audiences are running to watch it. In the long run kindness is never left unnoticed. Long live Neerja Bhanot, may her selfless bravery and heroic sacrifice will never be left unrecorded in the pages of history."
