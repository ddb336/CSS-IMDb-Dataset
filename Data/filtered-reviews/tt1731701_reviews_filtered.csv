" Hailee Steinfeld, Sophie Turner AND!! Jessica Alba Sign Me Up I'm In!
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,5,"Sign me up NOOOOW! I love this move; it's simple however very endearing. I love Hailee Steinfeld. She's super gorg. Barely Lethal is really original, cute fun that's terrifically geared towards female teens. I love young Sophie Turner as the rival spy and Jessica Alba too has a great part in this and is really good. I love Jessica Alba so much. Barely Lethal is a 1-of-a-kind adventure."
" Seriously... what other movie blends action, comedy, thriller, teen romance, coming of age, and a BADASS fight scene?
",2020-10-09 00:00:00,7,"Imagine rifling through your DVD collection and grabbing Salt, Get Smart, 16 Candles & Fatal Attraction and throwing them all into a blender. Aside from getting a lot of DVD splinters in your face, you'll get an experience like none other.""Barely Lethal"" is the story of a teenage girl who is a highly trained assassin but she can't survive a week in high school. The setup is brilliant. Almost satirical, but not quite, it takes us to the realm of utter absurdity, but underneath it all is a solid metaphor about the difficulties of adolescence. This is a timeless story which is why it's fun for all ages & demographics. I'm male and old enough that I saw ""The Breakfast Club"" in the movie theater when it came out ...and I loved this flick.If you are prepared for some wild wtf swings in plot, tone, theme and presentation (or even better, if you can see it as part of this film's charm) then you might love this flick, too. In the Making-Of bonus features, you can see that the entire cast is having a blast and acting like teenagers during filming. This translates into great on-screen chemistry as well as some genuine silly fun. As 40-year-old Dan Fogler (the hilarious Mr. Drumm) says, ""My maturity level definitely dropped a few points.""The comedy is mostly situational; in other words there aren't a ton of punchline gags & snappy zingers, but there are several great LOL moments worth the price of admission. There are also some wonderfully unexpected role-reversals, such as the scene where our nerdy heroine meets the cheerleader gang for the first time. And I saved the best for last: the climactic fight scene! Physically impressive, dramatically intense, and logistically HILARIOUS (it happens on the dance floor at homecoming), the action in this flick may be over the top, but that's sorta the point. A+ for originality in being the only teen romance flick in history which takes us to a knockdown, dragout, punchbowl shattering fight scene at a dance. If you can get past the ""wtf"" factor, you'll have a great time."
" Seems to be aimed at tweener girls
",2020-08-03 00:00:00,6,"This movie is targeted completely at young girls, aged 12 to 14. There isn't a lot of realism in the action sequences, but that is unimportant.The movie is a sort of indoctrinating preparation for high school. e.g. the popular boys may be thrilling, but the nice, smart, clever boys are more fulfilling. And when bogged down in the frustration of daily life during the mid-teen age range, it is difficult to see how it isn't so bad compared to other people's situations.As well, at around 6 years after release, it is rapidly becoming dated regarding topical issues.I found it odd that the mother literally forced her daughter to go to an unchaperoned party that would clearly have drinking.This movie is safe for Jr. High school aged girls, and is probably not interesting to anybody else."
" Actually quite entertaining
",2020-07-22 00:00:00,6,"I came across this becase of Sophie Turner, Samuel L. Jackson & Jessica Alba.
First I thought it would be more like Cody Banks, but it´s more like a teenage RomCom (But not a bad one).
Sure the story is prettypredictable, but it got it´s funny moments.
I think it´s good for a sunday afternoon, when you don´t have anything else to do and want something easy."
" Could Have Done More with the Concept
",2020-06-16 00:00:00,6,"(Flash Review)Is surviving high school harder than soldier assassin training? Watch and see. This kicks off with a group of little girls are being trained to be effective soldier spies to stop terrorists as they are unsuspecting. When one of them grows up and wonders what a normal childhood would have been like, she is able to escape and join a family as an exchange student. From here this turns into a typical teenage acceptance and finding oneself movie and using her soldier skills to stand out in the crowd. All with the ongoing fear of her training group locating her and taking her back. Surviving the social challenges of high school turns out to be harder than soldier torture test training. There were a couple lightly amusing scenes but it played the teen angle more than the solder angle that the film & TV series Hanna did."
" Mean Girls Become Trained Assasins!
",2020-05-30 00:00:00,6,"I wasn't sure about this movie, but I always give a film no more than 30 minutes to decide whether I want to continue watching and even then, with Samuel L. Jackson as a supporting cast member, I was a little disappointed that there aren't more fight scenes. The movie had some slow parts, romantic parts, high school scenes and one car chase between Hailee Steinfeld's Megan character and Sophie Turner's Heather character and a really awesome 'Stephen Seagal' type fight scene in both the school and in the neighbourhood. It's worth watching at least once, though."
" A Decent Light Comedy
",2020-05-24 00:00:00,6,"This isn't an amazing movie, but it is a light-hearted teen movie. The story line is uncomplicated, the acting is fairly solid throughout. It has a fun energy filled soundtrack. It isn't an epic movie but if you are in the mood for a few giggles - grab some popcorn, sit back and simply be entertained for a while."
" Really cheesey and cliche but still fun silly teen movie
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,4,"It's much more high school drama romance than an actual action movie. It's a silly movie about a girl trying to navigate high school and having a crush with a few fight scenes sprinkled in. I wouldn't say it's high quality but it was still fun. A bunch of incredible actors doing their best with a terrible script. It's definitely a laugh.Also don't even get me started on how problematic the ""friend zoned boy"" character is, but whatever."
" What in the actual fatphobic hell is this
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,1,This movie took time to fat shame someone who is thinner than well over half the population. Cheap jokes. Cheap writing. Cheap movie.
" Wade Wilson's hometown..?
",2020-05-10 00:00:00,5,"Silly fun? Yeah. A film you'll write home about? Probably not.Major plot spoiler: they mention Regina, Saskatchewan."
" Poor mix of spy flick and high school comedy
",2020-05-08 00:00:00,3,"BARELY LETHAL is a mindless mix of spy flick and high school comedy, with somewhat inevitably the latter featuring predominantly which is no surprise given the film's teenage demographic. Hailee Steinfeld plays a top secret agent who randomly quits to become a regular high school student, with all of the lame romance and supposedly humorous hijinks that go with that genre. Not that I was missing the spy stuff, which is on par with a random SPY KIDS sequel. The only highlight here is Samuel L. Jackson giving his usual assured performance, while alternatively Jessica Alba delivers the film's most wooden turn. Sophie Turner moonlights from the set of GAME OF THRONES and should have stayed there."
" They didn't take it seriously
",2020-05-06 00:00:00,1,"I thought this would be some harmless, low-key fun. With the premise and all the star power, I was really looking forward to this one. I wasn't expecting anything deep or amazing, just an enjoyable, uncomplicated action flick about badass teen assassins. Anna was fun. Violet and Daisy was fun. This was...extremely juvenile. More reminiscent of Stormbreaker than Final Girl. What I mean is...they didn't take this movie seriously. They didn't follow through on the premise and just go with it, they turned it into a kiddy movie...but not the kind even adults could enjoy. Really disappointing."
" Kind of lame
",2020-03-09 00:00:00,4,"While there were a few good laughs, this fell flat for the most part. The so called trained assassins fight scenes were lame. The storyline was weak and spread too thin."
" I was expecting something different... my bad...
",2020-03-06 00:00:00,6,"I'm sorry, I didn't like it much. If you don't take it seriously, it can be even funny.
My bad, I was looking for an action movie, something like Nikita or even Anna, not a joke, so I wasn't prepared.
In my opinion Sophie Turner had to be the heroin, not Hailee Steinfeld, but this is because I love Sophie and not much Hailee.
Anyway it's possible to enjoy the movie if you're a kid or a teen... I wish I was, unfortunately I'm not anymore.
I'm not saying as stupid people do... don't watch it, don't waste your time... I'm saying the opposite... watch it and decide yourself... my score is 6"
" Good for Entertainment
",2020-02-25 00:00:00,9,"It's a quirky film. Made for teenagers, but I liked it. The action is good and the comedy is what you'd expect. It goes on the premise of a teen spy wanting to live a normal life; so she ditches the weapons to live an ordinary teenage experience - which doesn't exactly go smoothly. lol. It's worth the watch if you're looking to kill a few hours."
" Sophie turner why!!!!
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,6,"Average fun movie.Good for a lazy Sunday afternoon in front of the telly.We liked it.Would of rated higher without Sophie Turner,no expression no emotion she plays the same in everything which is why i miss most films with her in would of been an 8.5 otherwise.
How easy was that to read?I dont understand why ""critics"" write in the user reviews when they don't think we'll know.The exuberance and neonoir obedience of the discipline made for an edgy and ravenous read(or rubbish to that effect) hahahahahhaha."
" Love the line
",2019-09-28 00:00:00,6,"'Take back Bieber', love it! True story happened in my life lol"
" Predictable but fun teen fluff
",2019-08-21 00:00:00,6,I needed a break from the real world and this did the trick. It just about clears average and is perfectly watchable. I thought some of the riffs on the tropes of teen comedy were amusing for anyone who'd seen the originals - although I have to admit I didn't laugh an awful lot. It is what it is: not every film can be an oscar contender.
" Barely Lethal Review
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,7,"Megan (Steinfeld) trained in the dark arts of the assassin by Samuel L. Jackson's shadowy Hardman. But equally well-trained and even more ruthless is her nemesis Knox (Alba).
Megan (Steinfeld), raised in a secret-agent training facility by a Nick Fury type (Jackson), wants to be a normal teenager. She fakes her death to go to high school, posing as an exchange student. Her nemesis (Sophie Turner) pursues her, but Megan has more trouble with dating, parties and the lunchroom social strata than fighting off assassins. A cute, undemanding teen movie which lets Steinfeld be likable and Turner be hissable. It's predictable, but the dialogue is smart, Jackson and special guest villain Jessica Alba have fun and the mix of sweet, salty and tough is genuinely appealing.Hardly groundbreaking but this high-school actioner ghosts by on its charm and sense of fun."
" cool chick flick
",2019-03-25 00:00:00,7,"Let this be your definite guide. Want a hard action movie? Think that because Samuel L. Jackson is in it, it might be? Nope. This is not for you. You'd only end up exasperated, criticising it.As for the name sounding like BARELY LEGAL, so damn why the fuss about that? Name's cute enough. Just don't think you're gonna score with it that way. No, NAKED WEAPON it certainly ain't. Look elsewhere.So don't expect the big Action or the big Naughty. Expect a chick flick about a young girl trained as an assassin. With a bit of naughty thrown in, but really not for the guys...Haylee Steinfield is cute, yeah, gets even cuter the more she grows on you. Love the fringe! What little there is of underplayed Sophie Turner gets a big mention. Magnificent long red tresses. Dove Cameron steals every scene she is in.Hilarious car chase scene. Funny quote by Dove best line in movie ""You are sketchier than a 2 AM waffle house"" Jessica Alba here blonde so no DARK ANGEL, still has those moves.Ol' Samuel training three-year-olds to be assassins sure takes the cake crowning his tough guy career :)I detected a definitive BEVERLY HILLS 90210 vibe. Megan WALSH and what with the two leads looking like Brenda and Kelly and kinda quite similar in many ways...Seems to have been made as a TV pilot for cable perhaps, or obviously with a sequel in mind, with Heather returning for college mayhem.Definitely not as bad as its score on Rotten Tomatoes would have you believe. Guess those people expected something else...But what it is, is way better than its undeserved bad rep."
" EVERY PUNCH HAS A PURPOSE
",2019-02-14 00:00:00,7,"Meagan (Hailee Steinfeld) is an orphan raised and trained by Hardman (Samuel L Jackson- no eye patch) to be an assassin. While on an assignment, Meagan grabs an opportunity to free herself from the group and become a normal high school student. Unfortunately for Meagan she has learned all she knows about High School from watching ""Mean Girls"" and ""90210."" She quickly doesn't fit in. She stumbles through High School until her past catches up with her.The premise is great. I was expecting a cross between ""Mean Girls,"" ""So Undercover"" and ""The Pacifier."" In a way it was, but wasn't well executed. The film could have been better. Hailee Steinfeld was not convincing in her role as a killer or High School student, which was ashamed since she had a great supporting cast. A movie you can like but not love.Guide: 1 F bomb. No sex or nudity."
" A better than average, and almost quite good movie
",2019-01-28 00:00:00,7,"Barely Lethal (2015). With Samuel L. Jackson, this teenage comedy espionage action thriller barely makes itself into a better than average, and almost quite good movie in fact. While this adolescent comedy has a great refreshing edginess to it, there have been so many great assassin movies out there that this movie had some high bars to reach. What really let this for the most part solid movie down was the climactic scenes which unfortunately required a lot more experience as writer of action thrillers. The most important part of the movie was let down by a rather traditional, uninspiring competition between the leading oppositional characters. Other really endearing and light-hearted espionage movies that hit their mark are: Wild Target (2010), Daisy & Violet (2011), Miss Meadows (2014), American Ultra (2015), and Wanted (2008)."
" Cute Movie - Made For Teenagers
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,7,"01/16/2019 Enjoyable from beginning till the end. The principle actress Hailee Steinfeld coupled with Samuel L. Jackson make the movie. Jessica Alba? - just an extra window dressing/bill board movie draw. Not a great movie, just well done and fun to watch. Bon Appetit"
" A light-hearted secret operative movie, undercover in the suburbs...
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,6,"I decided to watch this movie because Samuel L. Jackson was in it. I found it on Netflix and had not even heard about it prior to stumbling upon it. I read the synopsis, but wasn't overly reeled in by it, as it had that teenage-generic-action-comedy vibe to it.I will say that ""Barely Legal"" actually turned out to be far better than I had initially hoped or thought it would be, given the synopsis for the movie. And it turned out to be rather entertaining. Sure, it had those sappy moments that are seen in these particular movies, but it worked out well enough.The storyline, despite being so generic and predictable that it was oozing off of it, actually still turned out to be entertaining for what it was. This doesn't challenge the viewer intellectually, so just unwind, lean back and enjoy the ride.They had some good performers in the movie, and it was nice to see Jessica Alba in the role that she had. And of course Samuel L. Jackson was good, just a shame that he hadn't a more prominent role to play. Hailee Steinfeld actually turned out to be a rather good choice for the lead, as she definitely stood her ground and performed well.All in all, you know what you are getting yourself into here with a movie such as this, and the movie does play on every available trick that has been seen before in similar movies. But it still worked out quite well."
" Netflix needs a serious adjustment.
",2018-08-16 00:00:00,1,"This movie was recommended to me by Netflix at 98%. I cannot stress how much I want to cancel my membership over this. I would rather be waterboarded than watch this movie. The cast is a bunch of allstars, which is the only saving grace of this film, but the script is so terrible. Clearly the goal with this film was to make the most uncomfortable cringe-fest in human history. You can't tell me that wasn't the goal, because that was obviously the goal."
" Quirky but too much of a teen flick for me
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,4,"I was pretty excited for this movie when I heard it was coming out soon and watched the trailer. But it seems all the funny and good parts were put in the trailer. So, the movie wasn't ""all that"" for me. Had a lot of great actors and actresses like Jessica alba and Samuel Jackson."
" Trope Teen Movie
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,8,"First off, don't think that the header for this review is a slam. In fact this movie goes out of the way to embrace tropes. It tells you straight up it's gonna go for the bad-ass action and angst filled tropes with GUSTO!It takes all the awkwardness of high school, and all the insanity of action, mixes them and turns them on their head. First off the ""ugly duckling"" gets twisted a LOT. ""Megan"" is an orphan raised in Samuel L. Jackson's school where A is for Ammo, B is for Bazooka, and C is for Chainsaw. Our heroine can't help but exam Teen Life through that training, and the lenses of teen movies/books. And makes mistakes because she just doesn't get normal life. Overall, at least for me, a fresh take on yet another teen movie. Oh, and if Sansa had been based on Sophie Turner in this movie, Ramsey would have been fed to the dogs straight up."
" Maligned Gem
",2018-08-13 00:00:00,9,"Candy coated, sure, but not without poignancy. Above-par acting and a great cast elevate this slightly formulaic farce. Close your cold hard eye and have fun with this one. Some laugh-out-loud moments and great fight choreography. Hope to see the talented lead actress in more films."
" I thought it was good
",2018-08-06 00:00:00,8,First off I'm a guy not a girl and I'm not gay but I really enjoyed this. It was fun and I would definitely recommend for any young girls out there but it still good for guys to if you don't set and pick at it.
" surprisingly cute
",2018-07-31 00:00:00,5,"This was a surprise, and some fine acting saves this film from Disney TV territory. Though much of the plot hinges on inexplicable behaviour- (Why is Jessica Beal so angry? Even she doesn't seem to know!) cute dialog and charming vignettes make this teen friendly film a pleasant and even funny watch."
" uhhh
",2018-07-25 00:00:00,2,I didnt really care for this movie I only watched it because Dove Cameron and Sophie Turner is in it but I stopped watching because the movie didn't keep me interested
" awkward blend
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,5,"Megan Walsh (Hailee Steinfeld) is 83. She, Heather 84 (Sophie Turner), and other girls are trained to be assassins by Hardman (Samuel L. Jackson). She grows tired of her work and pines to be a regular high school girl. During an operation to capture Victoria Knox (Jessica Alba), she escapes and pretends to be an exchange student from Regina, Canada. Her host family is a divorced mother (Rachael Harris), snarky teen Liz Larson (Dove Cameron), and little boy Parker. All she knows about high school is from teen comedies which gets her into trouble. Both hunky musician Cash Fenton and AV nerd Roger Marcus take a liking to her.This has a few IT girls on the rise. There are a surprising amount of talent, both kids and adults, in a silly teen movie. It does try to subvert the teen movie tropes. It's just weird that it does it in a childish style. It struggles to find its true voice. It's both sincere and sarcastic. Steinfeld is sincerity incarnate. The set up is stupider than Spy Kids. It's an awkward blend that fails to be compelling. The only compelling aspect is that one roots for Hailee but this is stupid and not in a fun way."
" Enjoyable ride, fresh faces
",2017-11-02 00:00:00,7,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable ride from a fresh director and features great performances from three promising young actresses. Hailee Steinfeld continues to show her versatility as Megan, a trained assassin who just wants to be a normal teenager. Dove Cameron gives a strong performance as the daughter of the host family. I hope to see her in many more movies. Sophie Turner plays Megan's nemesis and has less scenes, but shines in the ones she's in, especially in the end. I'm very much looking forward to seeing her in the title role of X-Men: Dark Phoenix. The guys in this flick are mostly ornaments. Good old Samuel L. J. and Jessica Alba also play second fiddle here to the youngsters. Definitely worth a watch. Some action, some high school drama, very much fun. Looking out for more from director Kyle Newman."
" A great movie, nonetheless
",2017-10-05 00:00:00,9,"I believe this movie has a nice story line: a teenage girl missing out on the trends of adolescence and wants to be a part of it; and great casting: Hailee Steinfeld, Jason Drucker, Dove Cameron and Thomas Mann to name a few who did a fine job. I expected funny moments, and there were funny moments, actually funnier than I expected, and such as are peculiar to high school.Megan (Steinfeld) thought she could eventually be the best student at Newton High School as she was at Prescott, but realizes it's not as easy adjusting to it's highs and lows in just a few days or weeks. Jason Drucker, I'd say was my favorite character. He already likes Megan even before she arrived ""from Canada"", and throughout the movie, kept me giggling anytime he was on screen. He always looked like he wished he could say more than he was given. Cameron was splendid. I could feel her initial dislike for a totally inexperienced newbie at high school; and Thomas Mann played his nerdy role brilliantly. Sophie did good being a second-best, less preferred agent, envious of 83. Jackson played a fatherly (sort-of) role: serious minded, and looking out for his Prescotts. Although I do not perfectly understand Jessica's role, but so far she did well.It's really a good movie. The cast and crew were excellent."
" For some people, living a normal life is a challenge!
",2017-05-14 00:00:00,6,"Teen girl's film, but no usual romance-comedy. There are some small clichés, but being it is an action film, those parts looked kind of small. Yeah, nice casting. Hailee was really cool. The 'Descendant' girl Dove was good as well. The rest of cameos like Samuel L. Jackson and Alba was fine. It was from the director of 'Fanboys'. It tells the story of a girl trained to be an assassin from a very young age who escapes the centre to live a normal life in the real world. And that's where she struggles to blend in, as well as to overcome from the tailing troubles of the past.A well entertaining film, if you are not expecting anything big. It got a few great action sequences. Except Sam L. Jack, it is totally a chick film and most probably suitable for everyone for viewing. I enjoyed it, but I don't think I want a sequel for it. Particularly business wise that won't do well as this one was not received well by the film critics. Despite I approve it for a go, the rating wise it is just an average film. Sometimes that's where opinion divides for a film about what we felt watching it and how we're going to rate it later on.6/10"
" It's a good action-come-girl's movie
",2017-05-03 00:00:00,8,"The story is about a girl who is trained to be a killer spy since her childhood. She has never seen the outside world. So she is curious to experience the real world. One day, she escapes and tries to live a normal life. But struggles to overcome the new challenges. And how the remaining story ends told in the rest of the movie. I liked the action sequences. overall, it was a better movie than I expected."
