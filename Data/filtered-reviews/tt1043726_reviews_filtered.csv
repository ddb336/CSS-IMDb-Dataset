" Just plain bad...
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,2,The acting was poor and the script had too many holes. Historically inaccurate depiction of the ancient east. It's like the film tried so hard to be good but it just fell incredibly short.
" Again reviewers get it wrong, blows away the rocks Hercules!! Best fight scenes since 300!!!
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,10,"SERIOUSLY I'm learning that if some people say a movie is bad especially if its critics people always agree they have no actual opinion of their own!! This movie features phenomenal fight scenes, amazing 3d, incredible choreography, great story, phenomenal villian as the king, great cinematography!! Yes the acting was just mediocre some of the time but great other times the romance was decent but the 3d was some of the best ever!!, come on the rock is one of my favorites but as Hercules he was mediocre at best. Besides a big Hawaiian is Hercules?? This looked acted and was better version of Hercules. Ignore the lemming followers watch this especially if you were smart enough to get a 3d tv and keep it!! This movie was phenomenal in 3d !! I would have gave it a 8.5 but gave it a 10 because of the horrible Underrated rating!!!WAKE UP PEOPLE!!! This movie was like being on a great motion ride. Remember the whip scene was that amazing in 3d or what!!!!!!!!!!"
" Not worth buying on DVD. Stream this one
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,7,"This one is going on the dogs of the year because there are better ones that did a better job like 300 and Troy but this one is not one of them. No this one is actually cheaply made by Lionsgate. The only credit I can give this movie is for the combat action scenes and for the lightning scenes otherwise this movie is just poorly organized. Jumps around a lot and this movie could have used some improvements. I had to turn this movie off because it put me to sleep that's how bad this one was and I wish I don't got to revisit this box office stinker. Come on, you guys are better than this. This movie had potential but couldn't seem to pull what 300 could pull off so 7 for me just because it tried. Come on Lionsgate, you guys are better than this."
" Good Movie
",2020-12-22 00:00:00,6,"Contrary to the other review of only 1 star, he has no credibility to rate this as such. I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Good plot."
" Hercules' worse adaptations!
",2020-12-19 00:00:00,3,"The first thing to notice is that the scenes are shot very similarly to the ones from the movie 300, it's not necessarily bad but it's just obvious. Personally, I don't like this way of shooting, but the tastes are not discussed. Poor choice of actor for Hercules, who also not acts very well, while the acting of others is also not good. Hercules is shown to be extremely strong when fighting an indestructible lion and later struggles with ordinary people, such an approach somewhat disorients the viewers, which is certain that there is no constant definition of his strength. Almost not watchable, certainly one of Hercules' worse adaptations."
" While its not the best Hercules movie by far, it isn't as bad as reviewers made it seem.
",2020-12-11 00:00:00,7,"It could be just me that feels this way because I'm one of very few people who gave this movie a positive review. While the film isn't perfect by any means. Overall I did like it and find it enjoyable.First the cast in this film I thought were pretty good. I had no issues with any acting or dialogue at all. I also thought the pacing was good and the movie diddn't feel draggy at any point. The visuals were decent could been better but definitely diddn't think they were anything to complain about.What I diddn't love about this movie was the action. I felt it was the weakest point by far. It just was dull, boring, and uninspiring. There was no blood at all and most moves looked awkward. Some of the scenes also felt rushed and diddn't do anything for the movie. The romance I was on fence about. While it wasn't worst I've ever seen it was slightly cringey at times.With all this said I would recommend this movie for a watch if you're not someone hard to please and are into films like this."
" Not very good.
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,4,"The movie is good enough as a filler while doing some other tasks. But not much worth in sitting back to truly enjoy.If you are familiar with the Greek myths, this movie is way off the mark in many ways. The first scene at Hera's temple was rather irritating.As it progressed, we started getting a sort of ripped off devalued Gladiator plot, and some of the stylings of a few other films.There wasn't much to offer a second watch or a recommendation to others to see it."
" unbelievably bad
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,1,"Certainly the worst (Greek or any) mythology movie I've seen and one of the worst films I've seen in general. I didn't expect the plot to true to the actual mythology (300 was VERY far from any historical truth, and its based on history, not mythology) but this was simply not even remotely ralated to Hercules. And it would be ok to me, had it been just a decent action movie. I can't believe someone payed to film this garbage. I can't even begin to describe how bad EVERYTHING was. The only plus is that I laughed really hard with the name the chose for Hercules' companion: SOTIRIS!!! I wish I could describe to a non Greek how funny this is!"
" Disaster
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,1,Whoever made this movie doesn't have the slightest idea neither about the legend of Hercules nor about Ancient Greece.Awful from every single aspect.
" Not bad
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,6,"This wasn't a terrible movie, I kind of enjoyed it. It's like a mixture of 300 and gladiator. I don't get all the bad reviews. If you like a good action flick I would say watch this."
" Unjust reviews
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,7,"After extreme hesitation to watch it due to the extremely harsh sheep like reviews on this I decided to take a watch for myself, not a bad film at all not an extremely good film either, I'm assuming the reason it has received such harsh reviews is done to Hercules being such a great tale and if something so big is done to near perfection it will be slaughtered"
" Excellent Entertainment
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,9,"I nearly did not watch this due to the poor ratings.
This is not going to be a long diatribe about any failings or successes of those who made it, other than to say this. Please do not listen to the so called film critics as they must have all been in the same hot tub when it started filling with cold water.
I emplore all who like movies to make their own judgement and not dismiss a film it due to its ratings.
This is a really good entertaining film that is well worthy of the time."
" It's another Hercules movies
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,6,"Is this movie good? I wouldn't say that by any means. Is it bad? Nope, not that either.
It's alright. Worth watching if you want to see a movie."
" Who'd have thunk it!!
",2020-06-24 00:00:00,1,"What a stinker!!!! 1) Kellan Lutz, probably a nice guy, but woodier than a plank. 2) Scott Adkins, probably a nice guy too, but!!! 3) Renny Harlin. Do I need to go any further?"
" Rubbish
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,1,Why the Americans take other countries history or mythology and ruined it? Seriously Hercules a slave? Fight in arenas? If you want make a good film based on Greek mythology read and learn and make exactly what Hercules really was! Waste of time! If wasn't about Hercules and someone else fiction character that is not from history or mythology I would say is a good film but as I know the Greek mythology all in this film are rubbish! Imagine if someone take someone from well what history you can have and make a rubbish film and insult you! You not going to like it!
" Just terrible.
",2020-05-29 00:00:00,1,"This film is truly one of the most unoriginal, terrible films I have ever seen. A true disgrace to the art form that is cinema. It epitomizes everything that is wrong with contemporary filmmaking. A shallow and predictable cliché at best."
" Renny Harlin is no Zack Snyder
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,1,"This is perhaps one of the most stupidest films I have ever seen it is based on Greek mythology and is basically supposed to tell the story of Hercules but as you see everything is done poorly here the acting is terrible Kellan lutz cannot even say his lines properly and nothing makes sense I even see him trying to win a girl he loves and that is hebe and she is Gaia Weiss and she is also terrible I heard many rumors how this was bad because of to many ridiculously confusing plot holes such as when a king names and announces his new son and Hercules also has a brother named iphicles and I hated him with a vengeance he was annoying and stupid I hated every aspect of this movie the charachters are unlikeable I can laugh at the fact they even have connection and they are all unlikeable and speaking of Hercules he looks like the director Renny Harlin was trying to do a rip off from Thor like Hercules is Thor and iphicles is Loki many viewers compare this film to those charachters they are both gods here it is Greek and in Thor it's Scandinavian but I think it's nothing compared to Thor the charachters there where likeable and I liked the portrayals of the gods Loki and Thor and their father Odin there here it was not good whatsoever and what really is horrible is the chemistry between Kellan lutz and Gaia Weiss they have absolutely no chemistry at all and the beginning where king amphytrion names Hercules alcides but he is really named hercules by his mother and king amphitrion calls him his son but Hercules realizes that Zeus is his real father and when he and his army go confront him he says the one who rules it all is his true father why did he have to say that he could have just said his actual name Zeus and another one of the worst parts of this piece of garbage Is that the fight sequences are slow motion and speed up and pause all the time this is one of the worst action scenes an action movie has it gave me a headache and I was uncomfortable the whole time i can obviously tell why this garbage was universally panned by critics it was a mistake to make it if you all want a better Greek mythology film watch 300 that is way better or just watch gladiator that is a real classic film of fighting in historical dramas this feels like a rip off from it and Renny Harlin proves he is no Zack Snyder and that he cannot make movies properly and speaking of Snyder he is a way better director than Harlin and he is a real good action director Renny Harlin is nothing compared to him and I believe Harlin was just copying him and doing an imitation from his 300 film. Anyhow this movie has everything you need to make a bad movie l, bad cinematography , crappy directing, trashy set ups, bad editing, terrible acting, atrociously awful script and story writing this movie is an abomination, nothing in this movie was good action movies by any genre are supposed to be made for entertainment and this has none of it i was bored the whole time I was watching this pile of dung, watching the clock malfunction would be far more entertaining than this, avoid This one at all costs"
" Hercules with Sorbo was more accurate than this!
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,1,"As a Greek watching this made confused me since i didnt know if i should laugh or cry. You have a myth that you can either try to copy it or change it completely but have a good result and a movie fun to watch... This movie does do either!
In the myth Hera wants to kill Heracles (sends snakes when he was a baby) here, his birth is her own idea! His father was a fugitive! not a king and he loved Hercules.His brother had a good relationship with him, so good that he followed him in many of his campaigns until he died in one of them. Ivi was a minor goddess of youth, doughter of Zeus and Hera. Nemea's (Nemea is a Territory! he had to GO there) Lion was one of his 12 Labours around Greece and not just a random Lion near his home!. Greeks buried their dead not burn them. ""Sotiris"" (from Sotiria->Salvation) and other names used on this movie are modern Christian names!!! Not ancient Greek names. There were not such underground fights before Romans and Sicily was Greek back then. Romans were not even a thing when Hercules was supposedly around (we are talking about thousants of years apart) so watching ""gladiators"" in a movie about Hercules is SO rediculous. Talos was not the king of Crete!! Talos was a bronze ""Robot"" (an automaton) guarding Crete from side to side. Chiron was a centaur not an old man and he was Achilles tutor/teacher not Hercule's. Even his mother is younger than him in that movie (reminds me the same stupidity in ""Alexander""). And this is for the first 60 minutes as i am watching this, i dont even want to imagine what will happen in the last 30 minutes. As i said, even though i am Greek i dont have a problem if you change the myth... after all they are just myths, but if you do so, do it so that the result is better than the original myth or at least as good or there is no point to write something so much worse!!! The movie Hercules with Dwayne Johnson (same year) did so much better job! There the myth was MUCH more accurate but with a twist that was very much acceptable, so its not that they messed up historic timelines like in Xena, at least Hercules and Zena from the 90's were fun. The problem here is that the result is so BAD and not fun at all.."
" There is nothing here
",2019-11-06 00:00:00,3,"Calling it great because it's so bad is unwarranted as it has glimpses of good but no submarine. Story is all over the place, time lines jumpy and hard to keep up with, characters are who, ah what..."
" Looking for Scott Adkins as a Greek king? You've found him.
",2019-10-30 00:00:00,5,"I really only got this movie and watched it for Scott Adkins. As his fan, let's face it, I'm used to pretty bad movies with amazing fight scenes that make it totally worth it. I wasn't sure what to expect here, but I knew it wasn't gonna be his typical film.This movie is corny and not very good, but it's not terrible. For what my expectations were, I was entertained and didn't feel like I wasted my time.The first scene was the best for me. It felt like, even though we're so far back in time and he's playing this Greek king, we got a little taste of the Scott Adkins we all know and love. I actually chuckled out loud, appreciating how cleverly they incorporated his moves into this old timey fight and made it seem natural.I think Scott did a great job playing his character, it didn't feel weird or forced at all. I wish he would have gotten more screen time, but the movie wasn't about him, so I understand.I was very surprised at a couple of other very good looking fight scenes (without Scott) in the movie as well.All in all, if you're here for Scott Adkins, any of the other actors, or a mildly entertaining 5/10 movie, give this one a try."
" end battle was good
",2019-07-16 00:00:00,7,"It was not advertised well as never heard about this film, its a bit low budget but its ok to watch.
Not as bad as review say and if you like sparticus then this is worth a watch. Thier is a funny bit where they have to fight a lion.Its like the sparticus series with good battles but no sex."
" my notes
",2019-06-25 00:00:00,1,"Just sucks. a few cool parts but everything else was terrible. terrible acting, stupid scenes, very boring and pointless, waste of time (1 viewing)"
" Embarrassing
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,1,"As a laugh I made some sock puppets and my young son and I filmed them with my phone.
Our film looked better than this.
My son wrote the story - about a monster shopping for eggs, as he wanted an omelette.
To this day I judge his storyline to be better than this films.
This film, however has one REALLY strong element to it - it eventually ends."
" Not what I expected
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,6,What happen to Hercules long hair!!!!!. I believe his strength was his long hair . It was k but I kept waiting for his hair to grow longer .
" Due to lack of own legends and myths
",2019-04-10 00:00:00,1,"When will american moviemakers EVER learn to keep their paws off mythology. They don't have their own myths so for some reason they think they are capable of interpreting other cultures myths. Don't..... Just don't.
King Arthur, Troy, Robin Hood.... Disasters one after another. And here again they don't disappoint in being disappointing.
There are so many nice stories made in the states.... Stick to those and stop messing with things beyond your comprehension."
" The Legend Of Hercules Review
",2019-04-07 00:00:00,7,"Ancient gym bunny Hercules (Lutz) has to shake off the bonds of slavery to fulfill his true destiny: the throne of King Amphitryon.
The lore of Hercules has spanned centuries, yet it's unlikely to ever see a more generic treatment on film than that of Renny Harlin's overblown origin story, in which our hero (the bland Kellan Lutz) must escape from slavery in order to save the fair princess of Crete from marrying his brother, and claim his right to the throne of King Amphitryon (a hammy Scott Adkins). As is the way post-300, there is no shortage of armour-clad armies, amber hues and abs, and while the action is plentiful, it's often defined by speed ramping rather than exciting bloodshed. Watch this, and you'll struggle to remember it come the next harvest moon.The action comes thick and fast but the storyline is generic and Lutz makes a particularly dull hero. An Erymanthian bore."
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",2019-01-23 00:00:00,4,"I was a History major and as such I find these types of films difficult to watch. They are so inaccurate and give people the wrong perception of history, then again, The Legend of Hercules was directed by Renny Harlin, and he wouldn't put his name on any old thing. After praying to Zeus for guidance, Queen Alcmene (Roxanne McKee) is picked to carry the son of God. The King however knows that Hercules (Kellan Lutz) isn't his and commits an act of betrayal that separates Hercules from the woman he loves. When I think of the mighty Hercules, Kellan Lutz isn't the first name that comes to mind, but he does a pretty solid job with the role. The rest of the cast also performed equally well, and for once the cast wasn't the problem. A film like this has a story to tell and that story can't be told in an hour and half. I enjoyed the narrative, but the best parts of the film were so rushed, that I felt slighted. The whole Egyptian angle should have been a major theme, but it only lasts about ten minutes, and before you know it, Herc is fighting for his life is arenas around the world, scenes that were also rushed. The film is very straight forward and far too predictable for a story like this. There are Kings and Gods, legends from thousands of years ago, but no twists or turns? No surprises thrown in for dramatic effect at least? Overall, the film is somewhat entertaining and as I said the cast was good, but The Legend of Hercules flies by at the speed of light, which makes the film difficult to really get behind."
" Wonderful action packet movie
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,9,This movie is awesome. Just ignore the other reviews from movie snobs. Just watch the movie you will not regret it i promise you!
" Good fun for an afternoon, makes me want to go to the Gymn
",2018-09-07 00:00:00,6,"I enjoyed this movie, felt it had some real guts and was on a par with Troy, 300 and Gladiator. The lead actor was handsome and really beefy but still athletic. The baddies were slimy, bad and soon dis-likeable, as they should be.
Noticed some odd things but the story flowed for me, just a few jumps here and there.
The Greeks held athletic games, but not gladiatorial death fights. They show cased the red plumed corinthian helmet in this movie, but Greek soldiers wore a a great range of mostly bronze helmets, so it would have been nice to see more.
Hercules/Al came from Thebes, an important town in ancient Greece, It has no Port and is far inland. By the way his real name was Heracles, the Romans used the name Hercules.
But no matter. I really liked the Hercules character. He was approachable, vulnerable, loyal, committed, compassionate, romantic, strong and tender. The real Hercules was probably memorable but volatile, moody, selfish prankster who had little conscience about killing, but a valuable asset on your side in battle, like most psychopaths.
I dialogue was at times cheesy or predictable, other times was realistic for what was happening. The most predictable was the cry of "" we fight for FREEDOM fellow Greeks, let us take back the kingdom that was taken from us by this tyrant"".
I was thinking in the last scene where Hercs and Hebe are in bed holding their baby boy, ""now that he is King, he'll be looking after the sewage system, appointing supreme court judges, revoking the previous kings treaties, opening markets and and the attending court, plus loving his Hebe and going to war in spring."" Yes he will be free and very very busy not becoming a tyrant like his stepdad."

" THE MYTH BUSTERS
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,4,"This was one of my favorite cosmic myths until this razzie nominated film. The action was a ridiculous slow motion. What was that lion looking thing? Did Asylum make this film? Couldn't they hire any actors? Kellan Lutz? Did the ""Twilight"" series zap him of his acting ability too? Sure I knew how it ended, but at least try to entertain me. I would have never believed I would be pining for the old black and white Hercules movies dubbed in English.Hercules was dull, lifeless, and couldn't read a line. What was with the buzz cut? It rates a razzy. I can't wait for the spoof.Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity. Woman faking an orgasm for Zeus."
" Go to see how to never make an expensive movie again
",2018-05-30 00:00:00,7,"Does this film signal the end of Kellan Lutz career? It seems so because this is destined to bomb so hard. And it is easy to figure out why- the acting is terrible, direction lacks panache and grace and the special effects would probably be at home in the year 1987. This film will destroy many careers. (Go to see how to never make an expensive movie again)"
" Heroic tale done well
",2018-05-11 00:00:00,9,"This heroic tale was done quite well on all levels, top notch director Renny Harlin made sure of it. Kellen Lutz and Scott Adkins both had the physical presence needed for their roles as did all the guys who were in fight scenes. Having said that, the film had some brutal battles. It also contained a romantic storyline, sibling rivalry, jealousy, and so on...plenty here to sustain interests.The legend of Hercules is a well made Greek mythology flick if I must say so myself. It is always unfortunate when great films such as this get underestimated. I never listen to negative reviews. I don't know about you but I'd rather see something for myself rather than listen to people who are cynical about everything."
" Who said that the Disney's cartoon version was bad?
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,3,"If we mix ""300"", ""Gladiator"", ""Troy"" and more greek myths, we have this movie. A movie with a scheme not original at all: Queen is not happy with her king, Zeus visits Queen and she has his Hercules; years later, Hercules goes lovely doo with Princess of Crete, but surprise!! She is engaged to his badass older brother, then the king send Hercules to war = to his death? Here one can start to guess what happens in the end ( I will let you think until the end of this review). So then, Maximus... err... I meant Hercules, becomes a badass gladiator and gets his way back to his beloved. By the way, have I mentioned that he has no super strength at all? We do not see it until later in the film when he is chained like Jesuschrist and asks for help to his (God) daddy and he goes all Incredible Hulk. So back into the Spartacus arena... yes!! I forgot to mention, there is the actor who plays Spartacus in the flesh!! He is a general who befriends Hercules when he is sent into war. At this point in the movie, you are waiting for those HD fights and some flesh (yummy). But sorry to disappoint you, this is Hercules, not Spartacus the series (rated R), so ladies, no lucky for us..... Focusing on the actors, let's not forget that the main character, Hercules, is portrayed by Emmet Cullen and he is not a vampire God, but just a plain man and maybe an underwater model too, cause he really has a style to get out of the water...At some point(s) in the movie you get a bit lost because you are like, how did this happen so fast? Have I missed anything? The answer is NO! (and be thankful for that). You only have wasted 90 minutes of your whole life and by the end you cannot stop thinking: I liked the Disney movie much better!!"
" Recipe for a cinematic disaster
",2018-01-30 00:00:00,2,"Pick up a few names of ancient myths, add up a few antique locations, erase everything that made up the whole thing, gave it soul and kept the stories lasting for millennia. Dismember various things, rob the characters of their backgrounds. Then add something completely foreign, as long as it looks antique. 1200 BC or 200 AD - obviously does not matter. Sp the year 2000 is the same as the year 600? Then let the figures of antiquity act like people living today. And finally you have this cinematic crime."
" Not all that bad
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,4,"Effects not perfect but still a lot of effort was put into the film. I don't want to bash the little guys. This was somewhat watchable and some of the action was impressive gymnastically. Looks like a kid film or cable TV film for educating us. In any case the half-god Hercules is not your sissy half-god Jesus. Jesus made god more sissy and less killy I suppose, but now man does more killing than Him. Fun to watch with low expectations."
" Hercules deserved a better movie
",2017-10-27 00:00:00,3,"If you want to watch a Kung Fu movie with swords, this could be it.It can be entertaining for some but it relies heavily on sword action with too much martial arts involved, according to what seems today's trend of sword fighting maybe to please an younger audience. The problem is that this martial arts meets sword will never be realistic, and it can be sometimes atrocious to watch!A real sword fight doesn't evolve jumping 16 feet high! If it were only Hercules capable of doing it... well he is the son of Zeus! However, many other human soldiers can do it as well...Watch it only if you have nothing else better to do."
" Absolutely stupid. There is virtually nothing good here.
",2017-09-20 00:00:00,1,"Its not uncommon, unfortunately, to see Greek mythology being run over and clobbered by cinema or TV, with its most famous stories being rebuilt or turned on things that are anything but Greek mythology. This film is just one more that does precisely that, using characters of the myth of Hercules to create a new story. So I'll start by object the title. This isn't ""The Legend of Hercules"", it's just a story where Hercules enters without us understanding why. Script is so basic and primary that it looks like one of those lousy, melodramatic novels, sold in supermarkets for a few coins. I would even say that screenplay is just an excuse for a ton of action and pure hard pounding which seems inspired by movies like ""300"" or ""Rambo"".Although I have managed to like or digest some of his films, Renny Harlin is far from being a truly skilled director. In this case, he totally lost his notion of ridicule, and this movie will probably haunt him to death. The cast is extraordinarily bad. Kellan Lutz is a lousy protagonist. It may have muscles, but it also has the same dramatic expressiveness as a Guinea Pig. He has no charisma, no presence and cannot express emotions, just strength. I've seen hosts of TV cooking shows with more dramatic skills than this actor, who should look for another profession. Good luck with that, Lutz! Gaia Weiss is attractive but she doesn't seem to know what she's doing there, and is never fully committed to the movie. Somebody give a map to this girl, she's lost and confused! Scott Adkins gave life to a cardboard villain, histrionic and pathetic, worthy of the worst possible death. Roxanne McKee is too young for the role she played. Liam McIntyre seems to be the best actor in this disastrous cast.Visually, the film abuses CGI and sound effects to increase the impact of scenes, especially fights and action. However, the quality of the final work is rather mediocre. Bad cinematography, blurred, with colors between gray and brown, doesn't help either. Combats are utterly unrealistic, some blows and jumps are absurd and that effect of pausing or slowing down the film for a few moments in the midst of a jump or blow is so cliché that it gave me cravings for vomit. Costumes and sets are equally ashamed. The soundtrack is boring and ordinary.In short: this film is a caricature, a cartoon where characters from the Greek legend of Hercules were chewed, dismantled and thrown into a kind of idiotic video game, lifeless and without emotion, for an hour and a half of pointless fights."
" Bad screenplay, bad acting by a badly-selected cast
",2017-09-11 00:00:00,3,"I agree with an earlier community poster who remarked that the only good acting in this dreadful opus is by Liam McIntyre, who plays the hero's sidekick. It is sad to think that they had him on hand but it didn't occur to them to offer him the title role. He would have been so much better. He infused some life into the scripts he was given when he played Spartacus, in a mini-series. The script for ""Legend of Hercules"" (2014) is so full of clichés that it's a wonder anyone was willing to accept a credit for it."
" Has a lot of potential
",2017-05-15 00:00:00,10,"It has a lot of potential, the story of Hercules portrays a strong willed, brave character. If a second is released, it should include a more graphic approach to fighting as it was pitiful, the chosen main character was the correct choice but the story line needed some tweaks. All in all I would thoroughly like to see a second movie maybe re-made."
" Just terrible
",2017-04-27 00:00:00,2,"So, first of all I would like to say that I usually like fantasy movies and I can accept them being too much fantasized and similar things.This movie, however, I completely disliked. It is terrible in every single aspect I can remember, I saw literally nothing good about this movie. Plot is faulty and bad, for action movies it is boring as well. Twists are terrible if they can be called twists. Acting and special effects are even worse, I really don't like it when you pick actors by their modeling skills instead of their acting skills.I am not even going to waste any more of my time on this movie, so here it goes, I, with all my heart, suggest you to skip this movie. I'd prefer any cheer-leading movie to this one."

",2017-04-15 00:00:00,6,"There is nothing wrong with this movie. Not a remarkable flick, but far from the 1 star reviews. But there is a lot wrong with most of the reviews. It's more interesting to hear what really caused people to give it such low ratings, surely because of some hate for some reason. The movie deserves perhaps a 5 or a 6/10.No doubt, this is not an Oscar winner movie and not a summer blockbuster. But for the type of movie, it's a good enough one. Reviewers here say atrocious acting. Perhaps they need to open their eyes when watching a movie. Not the best acting for sure, but good enough for an unpretentious summer movie. Just know what you are going to watch.Atrocious? Unbelievably Awful? Worst Movie Of The Year? Worst movie ever? How a film this bad made it to theaters? These reviews are far more comical than the movie would ever be.Why this people want to compare this with the 300 or Gladiator? That is exactly the problem with all reviews. They were expecting another Gladiator and were totally deceived. If I was expecting to see Godzilla and I get T-Rex on the theater screen I would too be deceived.It is a decent pop corn movie for people WITHOUT expectations."
" Herc never had it so bad
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,3,"I had heard bad things about this movie particularly with how it has a rating of only 3% on RottenTomatoes. Please look at this, Rifftrax! Anyway, this movie is mostly deserving of the massive amount of hatred. Everything is wrong in every way. It has virtually nothing to do with Hercules at all. A lot of the story takes place in gladiatorial games, except that those were Roman, not Greek. I thought that was common knowledge? Anyway, the CGI in this film is simply terrible, especially with the lion. It's really easy to notice that this was made in 3D. Everything so awkwardly tries to jump out at the audience.It's a pain to watch this on TV. While not as bad as ""Jaws 3D"" it's still rather noteworthy. I thought that was Chris Hemsworth in the lead role, but I knew he's too good of an actor for something this terrible. I guess there's a few good lines in there and that's it. Where in the legends does it say that Hercules wields an electrocuting whip? It's just so stupid. Having seen ""Troy"", I thought this would at least be a long epic story, but I'm certainly glad it wasn't! This is worse than any of the ""Hercules"" movies shown on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"". Every personality from the mythology is changed and I'm not even that familiar with it. *1/2"
" no charisma lead
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,4,"In 1200 B.C. Greece, King Amphitryon conquers Argos by killing its ruler. Queen Alcmene is tired of his constant war. Hera allows her to have a baby with Zeus who would grow up to be the half-God champion Hercules (Kellan Lutz). He falls in love with Princess Hebe of Crete but his jealous older half-brother Iphicles announces his marriage to her. Hercules is sent to Egypt where he is set up for an ambush and sold into slavery.The opening fight is slightly interesting. It tries to be 300 but it's not as good. It starts out as a cheaper version of that style. That would be fine but it only gets worst from there. Kellan Lutz comes in and the muscle-bound dude is not charismatic enough to lead. The action style becomes cheaper and weaker. This Greek epic story has never seem less compelling."
" The Legend of Garbage
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,2,"Heracles, the greatest of the ancient Greek heroes. My dad told me all of his adventures and labors and heroic doings when I was growing up. There is such a rich and bountiful history behind the demi-god, so many tales that would easily make great movies, but instead we get this.From the director of action classics such as Die Hard 2 and Cliffhanger, comes this steaming pile of crap straight from the butthole of a $70 million project.What even was this movie? The Hercules done by Brett Ratner was coming out later that year (which turned out to be far better than this), so why was this one necessary?Acting - I don't think you can call any of this acting, just people reciting lines with either shouty voices or normal voices. Okay... - Kellen Lutz is not Hercules. Dwayne the Rock Johnson was more believable as Hercules. - Scott Adkins was wasted (not that he's a great actor). If you've seen his movies, you know what he's good for...sweet fist fight action sequences. He has one in this but it's poorly done. - The bad guys were just acting like over-the-top douche bags with no layered performances.Story - The romance plot line took up way too much time. It wasn't believable, or touching, in fact, it was quite dead and emotionless and I felt nothing for the to lovebirds. - There is 1 labor performed in this film, the Nemean Lion. It was rushed and lackluster, poorly executed. - It feels too much like Ben-Hur, Spartacus and Gladiator, 10/10 films. But they had layered characters, superb writing, an emotional story line and brilliant acting and this has none of those things. It doesn't feel original and it isn't even done well so you can't forgive it for being unoriginal.Action - (Cinematography and Editing) - It's PG-13 so there's no meatiness to the fights - There's no blood or real visceral violence of any kind - Looks like a bunch of people rolling around swinging wildly, mixed in with some WWE performances - Clone of 300, or Immortals. Same style, but poorly executed. - No point to slow motion because there's nothing impressive happening and there's no blood flying across the screen. - Cuts away when anything cool might happen - It just feels boring to watch - This is the most decent thing about the movie though, soooooooo...Costumes and Set Design - Costumes just look cheap - Sets look cheap - Backgrounds sometimes look like paintings - When they don't look like paintings they look like terrible animation - Terrible animation complimented by wonky green screen blending - Why did so much have to be CGI if it was garbage? Why not create a miniature model of the city and film that rather than create an obviously fake, video-game looking world?Writing - Dialogue is cringey, cheesy, corny, terrible....take your pick. - Nothing feels tense. - Characters might as well be 2D cut- outs. There's no layering to any of them. They're either good or bad. None are tormented or have problems. Take for example Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus - clearly disturbed and vile, tormented by his thoughts and emotions. That's a character. - Come to think of it, I don't think there was an actual script, just dot points written by 4 dudes in a room.Music - UninspiredSound Design - UninspiredMovie Overall - UninspiredRating 2/10What on earth actually happened here? Could barely slog through this turd."
