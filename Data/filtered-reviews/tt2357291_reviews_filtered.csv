" Rio 2 - The musical
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,3,Why did they ruined it making it a musical? If you like 1960s musicals you will like this.
" 6/10
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,6,Rio 2 is a horrible sequel I don't get the point of it Rio one had a reason this movie has no reason at all
" ""Happy wife - happy life""
",2021-03-14 00:00:00,6,"Like ""Avatar"", only instead of blue humanoids, we have blue parrots. It may be visually fascinating in 3D, but at home, on the computer, it did not leave a special impression. If you liked the first one, you will like this one too. If not, skip it.6/10"
" Really bad movie
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,1,"I hated that movie. This is not a children's movie. It looks like a drama-filled soap opera. This movie is very boring. I couldn't wait to finish it. In the movie the bird tries to find acceptance by his wife's father. This film sends a message from one who tries to please his father-in-law and is not accepted by the family, tries to impress and is rejected. He is a bird that uses a pouch and make pancakes. Really stupid and boring movie."
" Good
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,7,"In the sequel, Jade and Blu decide that their puppies need to learn to live freely, and everyone embarks on a trip to the Amazon. Characters like the bulldog Luiz, the toucans Rafael, the parakeets Pedro and Nico and the cockatoo Nigel are also back.Film reviewed on December 14, 2020."
" A boring - if colourful and well meant - follow-up
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,6,"Naught terrible about it, but 'Rio 2' is a boring - if colourful and well meant - follow-up to the 2011 original.The whole plot is basically just a typical family drama fest, filled to the brim with the clich√©s of relative and love quarrels. It's also entirely predictable, which doesn't help. A few of the characters from the first film are shoehorned in too, especially Nigel (Jemaine Clement).Jesse Eisenberg (Blu) and Anne Hathaway (Jewel) reprise their roles, Eisenberg is the better of the two. Bruno Mars joins the cast, I actually liked his voice for Roberto but unfortunately his character is forgettable.I'd guess the younger viewers will like this, as well as a number of others. For me, it's just very average."

" Rio 2
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,10,"While this sequel is not good as the first one, it is quite enjoyable for the whole family. It has the great animation, colors and some catchy songs. I actually love it."
" A bit of a mess
",2020-06-14 00:00:00,5,"This film continues the Rio story with just as much colour and exciting songs but tries to branch off in too many directions. We have loggers, children, jealousy, Nigel, a frog, fitting into a new tribe and more. Each of these were good but all together it was really unfocused."
" Rio 2
",2020-05-21 00:00:00,5,"It had been 9 years since I had seen the original film, made by the creators of Ice Age and Robots, but I do remember enjoying it, despite the long gap of time, I was up for seeing the sequel, directed by Carlos Saldanha (Ferdinand). Basically, Spix's Macaw Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway) and their three children, Bia (Amandla Stenberg), Carla (Rachel Crow), and Tiago (Pierce Gagnon), are living happily in Rio de Janeiro. But Jewel is disappointed to see her children becoming too domesticated like their father. Meanwhile, Blu's former owner, Linda Gunderson (Leslie Mann) and her ornithologist husband Tulio (Love Actually's Rodrigo Santoro) are on an expedition in the Amazon. After a fall down a waterfall, they discover a Spix's macaw feather. When the word gets out about this on television, Jewel believes that they should go to the Amazon to help find the blue macaws. While the kids are ecstatic, Blu is uncertain, but he is pressured into going along, but he has supplies, including a GPS, he believes will help them. Meanwhile, an illegal logging group leader named Big Boss (Miguel Ferrer) discovers Linda and Tulio's expedition, he orders his henchmen to hunt them down to avoid disruptions to their operation. At the same time, the evil cockatoo Nigel (Men in Black 3's Jemaine Clement) seeks revenge against Blu for crippling his ability to fly, and makes several failed attempts to kill Blu along with his new servants, anteater Charlie and poisonous frog Gabi (Kristin Chenoweth), who is in love with Nigel. Blu, his family, and their friends, Rafael the toucan (George Lopez), Pedro the cardinal (will.i.am), and Nico the canary (Jamie Foxx), use a boat to get to the jungle. Arriving, they find nothing, they are eventually taken to a flock of blue macaws that are hiding in uncharted territory. There, they meet Jewel's stern long-lost father, Eduardo (Andy Garcia), her Aunt Mimi (Rita Moreno), and her childhood friend, Roberto (singer Bruno Mars). Eduardo seems unimpressed with Blu; he is grateful to him for bringing Jewel back home but is opposed to Blu's suggestion to expose the sanctuary to Linda and Tulio to ensure their protection. At the same time, Blu is intimidated by the suave Roberto, who quickly bonds with Blu's kids. While searching for the macaws, Linda and Tulio end up captured by the loggers. Blu does his best to fit in with the flock, while Nigel gets closer to him by successfully winning a talent show to become a performer for a Carnival show. When Blu tries to pick a Brazilian nut for Jewel, he accidentally tries to get it in the territory of the Spix macaw's enemies, the scarlet macaws, led by the hostile Felipe (Philip Lawrence). Blu inadvertently causes war between the two tribes, accidentally hitting Felipe with a branch. The football (soccer) style battle ends when Blu accidentally costs the flock their territory. Despite his best intentions and efforts, Blu flies away upset over his failures. Blu decides that he will leave his human roots behind him to build a future with his family. He goes to visit Linda and Tulio but finds their campsite has been raided. Roberto accuses Blu of betraying the flock, but before Blu can defend himself, loggers storm the area. Roberto, unable to deal with real danger, panics and Blu is forced to save him. Blu orders Roberto to warn the flock while he goes to rescue Linda and Tulio. After doing so, Blu persuades the macaws to defend their homes instead of running away. With Blu's knowledge of human technology and help from the scarlet macaws, the flock successfully disable the loggers' machinery. Big Boss tries to blow up the trees instead, but Blu steals the lit dynamite and takes it into the sky where it detonates harmlessly. Big Boss runs off before Linda and Tulio can stop him, but winds up getting eaten by a boa constrictor. Nigel then appears and tries to attack Blu, but Gabi, while attempting to help, accidentally hits Nigel with one of Charlie's pines filled with her poison. Nigel gives a theatrical death speech before seemingly dying, and Gabi then drinks her own poison to die alongside him. But Bia points out that Gabi isn't poisonous at all, and an overjoyed Gabi lovingly smothers a dismayed Nigel and drags him away. With the flock now under Linda and Tulio's protection, Blu and Jewel decide to live in the Amazon with their kids but will continue to visit Rio in the summer. Eduardo finally drops his anti-human stance, and proudly accepts Blu into the flock. Nigel and Gabi are sent to Rio for study, Nico and Pedro's Carnival show goes on, and Luiz the bulldog (30 Rock's Tracy Morgan) arrives at the Amazon for a visit. Also starring Jake T. Austin as Fernando and Janelle Mon√°e as Dr. Mona. Eisenberg and Hathaway are still good as the two leading blue macaw birds, and the other voices in the cast are fine, but it is Clement as the spiteful cockatoo and Broadway star Chenoweth as the toxic frog infatuated with the villain that both stand out. The use of bright vibrant colours remain wonderful to watch for the places and creatures, and the musical moments are enjoyable enough, especially the operatic ""Poisonous Love"" and a theatrical ""I Will Survive"", it does not have quite the same quality and flair as the original, but it a reasonable animated comedy adventure for all the family. Worth watching!"
" Rio 2
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,8,"As a sequel to the 2011 original, Rio 2 continues in the tradition of its older sibling with screwball humor and madcap mischief. While maintaining a pedigree for celebrating song and dance through a kaleidoscopic burst of colors, Rio 2 is gorgeously rendered but offset by a clich√©d script that is also laced with classroom lecture.This sequel begins in Rio de Janeiro where our feathered friends Blu and Jewel (Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway) discover that they are not the last of their species after all. Along with their three kids, they leave Rio and fly to the Amazonian rain forest where an entire flock of blue macaws was reportedly spotted. As it turns out, the flock exists and is headed by Jewel's long lost father Eduardo (Andy Garcia) and guarded by her old flame Roberto (Bruno Mars). Now reduced to a stuttering parrot, Blu must man-up to his overzealous father-in-law (think Robert De Niro in Meet the Parents) while thwarting Roberto's attempts (think Owen Wilson in Meet the Parents) at charming Jewel. Meanwhile, Blu's nemesis Nigel (Jemaine Clement) has resurfaced and is all out for revenge.Come school days and kids will have plenty of reason to mimic their favorite characters. From human characters voiced by Rodrigo Santoro and Leslie Mann, to Blu's crooning friends Nico (Jamie Foxx), Pedro (Will.i.am), everyone is back for a second round of slapstick shenanigans. And joining the old cast are some feisty new voice talents including Kristin Chenoweth as Gabi, a poisonous dart-frog so obsessed with Nigel, you could even think of her as his psycho girlfriend. Haunted by a disastrous turn of events in the first movie, Nigel himself is loonier than before with a thespian swagger that pokes fun at none other than the Bard of Avon. Speaking of which, lookout for a hilarious scene aimed at adults where Nigel and Gabi find themselves dramatizing one of Shakespeare's greatest plays. While many such segments are genuinely funny, the story strays at times with subplots from deforestation to male bonding, before stepping into a puddle of teary-eyed melodrama. Kids laughed and adults clapped, but there were periods of silence too, and I am not referring to those brief scenes where death was implied.Emerging as a game changer in animated films, Blue Sky Studios, a subsidiary of 20th Century Fox, struck gold with its very first feature production - Ice Age (2002). It's been tunneling through a gold mine ever since. While Rio 2 might seem like a cash cow for some viewers, it is still a delightful animation with foot-tapping music to get your groove on. And like a Gloria Gaynor hit song performed by Clement's Nigel, there is every reason to believe this sequel will survive."
" Cliche message, lesser plot
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,8,"I'm just going to cut to the chase: It's ""Lorax"" with birds. The pro-environmentalist, liberal message isn't even subtle. However, the film does have its redeeming qualities. The songs are fun. Although the plot is ""been there, seen that,"" it picks up by about the 3rd act. The original was, well, original, but this is ""Shrek 2"" mixed with ""Madagascar 2."" Why does Hollywood think that humans are evil? News flash guys, not all humans are greedy, power hungry, animal haters. Stop depicting us that way. Also, there were way too many pop culture references. Please stop trying to be ""trendy."" It's just cringe-worthy for us to watch. The jokes are predictable and don't work. However, the film as a whole is fun.
Grade: C 7/10 3/5 stars"

" Blu, Jewel and the kids go to the Amazon
",2020-01-26 00:00:00,7,"When ornithologists Linda and Tulio venture into the depths of the Amazon Jungle they report that they might have found evidence of Spix's macaws living in the wild. When News reaches Rio Jewel convinces Blu that the family should head to the jungle. As they depart they are spotted by Nigel, the vengeful cockatoo, who follows with Gabi, a bright pink tree frog, and an anteater. Also posing a treat are a group of loggers determined to flatten the jungle before any macaws are found. When Jewel and Blu reach the jungle they are soon met by others of their species. They are led by Eduardo, Jewel's father... who is less than impressed by Blu; who he considers a mere pet. Blu tries to fit in but it isn't easy; everything he tries to do seems wrong. Ultimately though he will be essential to saving the forest.I enjoyed the first film more than I expected so decided to give this sequel a go; while I don't think it is as good as the original I still enjoyed it. The story was a bit cluttered; there was no need for the jungle talent show... apart from justifying the presence of Pedro and Nico; two 'comedy' characters who weren't that great in the first film and still aren't. Similarly the aerial football match seemed to be there for the animators to show what they could do rather than adding to the story in a major way. So much for the bad points; on the plus side Nigel continued to be a fine antagonist and his adoring associate Gabi was both cute and amusing; Kristin Chenoweth did a great job providing the voice, especially when she sang. The rest of the voice cast were solid; most notably Jesse Eisenberg and Anne Hathaway as Blu and Jewel. The central story was pretty good; leading to some child-friendly scary moments and an exciting confrontation with the loggers. There is of course a fairly obvious message about the need to protect the natural environment... it is just a shame that in reality, unlike this film, Spix's macaws are almost certainly extinct in the wild. Overall I wouldn't say this is a must see but it is fun and I'd recommend it to anybody who enjoyed the original film."
" Rio 2
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,2,"The visuals are just as great as last time, but the story is far too corny and even laughable for me to enjoy it."
" Not as toxic as the frog but not as beautiful as the rain forest either.
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,6,"Admirable attempt to create sequel immediately distinguishable from the first, trading in the urban Rio for the Rainforest. Quite logical when you think about it and no less in terms of local color and style.The actual substance of the movie is less pleasing, falling into the predictable trends of the romantic interests in the first movie now having kids and the father bird worrying he isn't birdly enough for his spouse when the more virile competitor comes to town.It's the return of our wonderful antagonist that is far more of a treat to watch and make sure you get ""poisonous love"" in your life somehow. Kristen Chenowith is a name I won't soon forget."
" GET THE FLOCK OUT OF HERE
",2019-05-30 00:00:00,8,"This is another song filled film that my grand niece loved. Rumors that a flock of Blues might live deep in the Amazon causes Blue, Jewel, the three kids, and the usual suspects to venture there. If they can find the endangered species, they can save the rain forest from the evil logging company.Jewel unites with family and an old friend that causes some jealous feelings in Blue who was a 'pet"" for the humans. The film climaxes to an ending that was inspired by Hitchcock. Good fun for the whole family, especially preteen girls.Doesn't quite measure up to the first film, but still a worthy sequel."
" Rio 2
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,8,"A good animation is made weak by clich√©d writing.Lot of work and thought and detailing goes into an animated film. But if the writing is weak it cannot be pulled off easily. RIO 2 precisely suffers from that. The scenes are too clich√©d for my comfort and the plot is very age-old. The bird formations, their beautiful feats have been all been seen in RIO and there is nothing new to offer on that front too in RIO 2. I felt like the basic format of the earlier film RIO was taken and just few modifications were done in writing. So it has that been there, seen that feel that does not add up any value."
" The sequel that should have never happened.
",2018-12-02 00:00:00,5,"This sequel should never have happened, there are countless cleeshayes and wacky slapstick humour."
" birds in Brazil
",2018-11-20 00:00:00,10,Review: I loved this movie because it shows the strength of family. The direction and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" Horrible movie. Shouldn't have made a sequel.
",2018-08-02 00:00:00,1,George Lopez and Anne Hathaway were awful in their roles and made the movie unenjoyable.
" Painful
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,1,"I'll take a root canal over having to ever endure this movie again. There is not a single redeeming quality to this nonsense. Lazy script, recycled unfunny jokes and zero likable characters. Run from this as fast as you can."
" A very disappointing and jumbled mess.
",2018-01-31 00:00:00,4,"Most animation studios can turn out great sequels, though sadly Blue Sky Studios strangely enough isn't one of them. While they do succeed at making very enjoyable original movies, their Ice Age sequels don't have a lot of rewatch value. With ""Rio 2"" however, I went in very hopeful. I really enjoyed the first movie with it's beautiful colors, fun songs, likable characters and a pretty good story and hoped the sequel could deliver. Sadly though, I walked out of the movie really disappointed. ""Rio 2"" just falls flat with a story that has way too many plot elements, new characters that are very unlikeable, and song numbers so forgettable and bland that not even Bruno Mars could make them fun. Let me explain why this is.
 
A few years after the first film, Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) and Jewel (Anne Hathaway) have been living happily with their kids in the grand and glorious city of Rio de Janeiro. However, Jewel feels that her kids are acting a little to much like humans (due to Blu having lived most of his life with a human) and wants them to get back to their natural roots. However when Blu's former owner Linda (Leslie Mann) and her husband Tulio (Rodrigo Santoro) discover that more sphinx macaws might be out there, Jewel decides to go to the Amazon to find the tribe which Blu reluctantly agrees to. Along with their friends Nico (Jamie Foxx), Pedro (will.i.am.), and Rafael (George Lopez) they go into the jungle and find the tribe where they meet the leader and Jewel's father, Eduardo (Andy Garc√≠a) as well as Jewel's best friend Roberto (Bruno Mars) and try to get Blu to get into natures ways and also hold a talent show, unaware that a logging company is planning to bulldoze the entire forest and that Nigel (Jemaine Clement), the villain from the last movie has survived the encounter in the last movie and is planning his revenge while also bouncing back to Linda and Tulio from time to time as well have a soccer game that serves no point to the story. Yeah, it's a mess.
 
The story in this movie just has so many plot elements in this film that it just got so confusing and full especially compared to the first film's very simple story. I think the reason why this happened is because the writers of this movie thought that the film needed to be bigger and have some more elements added to it though sadly they had no idea how to do it correctly. I also thought some scenes weren't handled right, particularly the reunion between Jewel and Eduardo. It was so rushed and didn't feel very emotional. Speaking of which, let's talk about the characters. The ones from the first film still have their charm and likable personality, particularly Blu. The new characters on the other hand, that's another story. They're all very unlikeable and even treat some of the characters harshly, especially Eduardo. Words cannot describe my hate for him. The way he treated poor Blu throughout the movie really angered me and finally by the time he called him ""pet"" I lost all faith in him. As for the others, Blu and Jewel's kids were just cliched and I also really wasn't fond of the loggers. I could understand what the writers were trying to go for, but they weren't funny at all compared to the smugglers and also didn't pose a legitimate threat. However, I think one of the biggest mistakes that the movie made was bringing back Nigel. He was a necessary villain for the first film, though bringing him back was pointless. Even his defeat at the end, which I won't spoil, was weak compared to the first film. In fact, he isn't defeated at all. Yeah, what a letdown. The song numbers, though nice, weren't as grand as the first film either. They didn't have anything especially memorable compared to the first film's Oscar nominated song and not even Bruno Mars, whose songs are fantastic, could make it work. The only thing that I could find better than the first movie was the animation. The colors were more grand and eye popping and could look realistic at times, but that was seriously the only thing that I found better.
 
""Rio 2"" just disappointed me. This could have been a great sequel, but it's jumbled story, unlikeable new characters and forgettable songs just made it very unlikeable. I feel bad for Blue Sky as yet this is another sequel that they stumbled up on. If there's any proof from this movie, I think that there are two lessons that they should hopefully learn. Bigger isn't always better, and that they should also stick to making original stories and not sequels. We'll just have to wait and see if they follow that advice."
" Another unnecessary sequel
",2018-01-16 00:00:00,6,"After the events from the first instalment, Blu, Jewel and their three kids embark on a two thousand mile journey to the Amazonian Rainforest where there are rumours about a flock of blue macaws. Obviously, their adventure won't prove to be without perils as an old ""friend"" is on their track in order to get revenge, while getting used to the new environment will become quite a challenge for Blu.It's an animation which introduces a new adventure for the blue macaw family, one which will influence everyone on the journey, hopefully in good. Unfortunately, as far as I'm concerned, this is one of those, how I like to call them, unnecessary sequels. They used the universe and the success of the first one and hoped to add something equally interesting, but I'm afraid that they failed. The story is as predictable as it is boring, reusing old characters which simply shouldn't have been there just to introduce a bit more ""suspense"", one which also fails in bringing something good into the equation. The new characters aren't pleasant or good either, each following a stereotypical pattern of a human character, only making the whole matters worse.Still unfortunately, all which was great in the first one somehow vanished or is present in a much lesser proportion. Take for example the comedy, one which managed to make me laugh many times in the first movie, simply does not exist in this one. It desperately tries from time to time, but doesn't manage to do anything regarding this aspect. The only thing which keeps its pride is the animation itself, which is simply amazing, no matter how you look at it. It simply lost the idea of the first one, its emotion, its story and, above all, its comedy, which made it overall a very good animation. They managed to create something which is truly mediocre from something very good, and this ""achievement"" shouldn't bring any praise for anybody.Overall, I have to say that I saw a mediocre animation, one that simply shouldn't have existed if you ask me, but since it does, it manages to be average in almost every aspect, making it a skippable movie. It reminds me of ""Cars"", which started as a masterpiece and got a sequel which simply dumped everything good about its predecessor and decided to use its own ways. Too bad..."
