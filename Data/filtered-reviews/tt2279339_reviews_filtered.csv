" Two stars for the star power, but...
",2021-02-27 00:00:00,2,"...what an unpleasant movie! If it was trying to be 'Love Actually,' then it failed miserably. Not a single storyline was interesting--instead they were sad and pathetic. I found myself marveling that the movie took place during one single day because it felt like it drug on and on. I just couldn't wait for it to be over because another reviewer said that the last 15 minutes made it worthwhile. I'm going to agree to disagree. Words kept popping into my head like ""ugh"" and ""ick."" I felt like I needed a shower afterwards. And what was up with Eleanor, the least likeable in this cast of unlikeable characters, ending up with the honorable, decent guy?? She literally leaves destruction in her path, but it's apparently okay because she did it for a guy? What about the other people's Christmases that she ruined in her eleventh hour ""redemption?"" Just one of the many examples of why I'm so perplexed that this script was greenlit and attracted so many influential stars. I would literally choose a root canal over viewing this so-called film again."
" nice light fun
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,7,Not sure I would've watched it if I knew it was a dog movie
" Dysfunctional Family Christmas x 4
",2021-02-21 00:00:00,2,"Very deceptive. Watched because Steve Martin was supposed to be in it. Instead, he voiced over a few lines for a dog at the end. What a cheap trick.The movie has a very mixed message. Everyone is vulnerable - no one is believable. Everyone is messed up, but everyone miraculously gets fixed for reasons no one can explain other than it's Christmas."
" Big hearted mess
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,8,"Wow, for anyone giving negative reviews... Where's your heart? I'm an emotional lady for sure, so this movie played well on my emotions. I love every single side story, but the main take away here is stop being so damn serious. Stop allowing little things in to ruin your relationships and your life. Life is truly about the little things, the small moments. This will forever be on my watch list every year, every time I'm sick, and every time I need a reality check. We all get too consumed by things that truly don't matter in the grander scheme of life. On your death bed, will you think about money not made? Or will you think of love not fostered? It's the latter. Grab your tissues, grab loved ones, watch this movie and be thankful."
" Cliche
",2021-02-11 00:00:00,3,"All the cliches in one movie. Just bad, long, boring..."
" Sorry so many reviewers just don't get it
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,9,"A lot of negative reviews here, including professionals, and that's sad... it's a psychologically difficult movie to watch, partly because it's about the pain that goes along with growing old, families, and life itself. But it's wrapped up sweetly and if you don't expect a comedy, you actually get to laugh a bit while you cry at the poignance in people coming together. I think you need to be mature (maybe even 55+ or so) to really ""get"" it?"
" Moments of real beauty
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,7,Okay so I don't understand the super low reviews here but I understand why it's not a ten. There are parts that are kind of cheesy and silly and I don't love all the characters... But there are moments of such real beauty in this movie. Absolutely worth a watch!!
" Eh.
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,4,"Something was missing from this movie. Also, It doesn't seem plausible that Charlotte and Emma are sisters. Charlotte looks old enough to be Emma's mom. Oh, wait, that's cuz she is! Diane Keaton was 70 during filming, and Marissa Tomei was 51."
" There is dysfunction in all families, the IMDB reviewer naysayers are in denial about their own families skeleton's in their closets
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,7,"This is by no means a drama, nor a comedy, but I classify it as a dramedy about real life issues. Family members argue. Family members are sometimes uncomfortable around each other. Husbands and wives, fathers and mothers, have ups and downs in their relationships. All families remember good times and bad times and so do the Coopers.This is not a warm and fuzzy feel good movie that you finish seeing and you are left with an uplifting feeling of happiness . What you will see is a point of view as if you are sitting at the Cooper's dinner table yourself and as hard as you might try to avoid it, you will consciously take a side with one family member over another.This film has an all star cast and the family and spouses interactions are sometimes intense but honest in their current feelings towards each other. I especially enjoyed all of the scenes between Alan Arkin the Cooper family patriarch and his waitress actress Amanda Seyfried which take place at his favorite diner.There are too many scenes throughout this film to mention them all but Olivia Wilde and the war veteran she meets at the airport actor Jake Lacey evolved quickly as each of them dug deep into the others psyche, and I wished there was more that we could have listened in on.I will be sure to watch this again sometime as it is one of those memorable films, not in a good way, but it may help remind us all to forgive, not forget, but to share our feelings and whatever the outcome the truth should come out. I give this dramedy a 7 out of 10 IMDB rating."
" Do not waste your time
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,3,"It's incredible how a movie with such a great cast can be such a waste of time. What is more, after seeing this mess of a Christmas movie, I felt so disappointed I had to go to one of the standard Xmas favourites - The Holiday, to feel good about my evening."
" Great cast, nice (raw) film
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,9,"Finally, a Christmas movie that's not super sappy or cheesy. It actually hits all the raw, genuine parts of family get together, trying to impress each other and not living the life others think you should. Sure, it's not perfect, but it's relatable, heartwarming and has a really calming soundtrack. Compared to cheesy Lifetime movies, this is gold. Worth watching."
" A christmas film for the background (when wrapping presents)
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,6,"This is like a better version of Love Actually. It's a multi-character film about a family of misfits. It's nothing special but it is OK for background watching when you are wrapping presents or something. There's actually some moments that catch you off-guard when it goes in the opposite direction of what you expect from predictable holiday movies. It's not one I'd watch every year but yeah, I thought it was OK."
" Possibly one of my top 10 in ( my) history
",2020-12-28 00:00:00,10,Exceptionally great movie. It's depth allows for watching anytime of year. I give it a 10 because of the shocking low IMDB score?? Its a solid 8 in my book. Love it!
" It's quite boring
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,4,"It's well acted, with a stellar cast but.... it's just rather dull. Save yourself a couple of hours and skip it. Wish I had."
" Never seemed to get going
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,4,Was very slow and not very funny. All seemed a bit pointless.
" Should Be on Your Christmas Watch List
",2020-12-23 00:00:00,8,"Can't figure out why it deserves bad reviews.. it's a Christmas movie so it can sappy. It really is much better than most Lifetime/Hallmark holiday movies and has a really good soundtrack.The characters are real and relatable. Doesn't everybody have an aunt who's real name is unknown? Who doesn't have some degree of a sibling rivalry with their sister? And I know I'm not the only one who's been freaked at the unattainable Norman Rockwell expectations of the holidays, ever trying to be the child I think my family wants. I could imagine each of the characters sitting amongst my family at a holiday dinner.This movie checks all the Christmas movie boxes: comedy, romance, redemption, good music, snow."
" Don't Love The Coopers
",2020-12-21 00:00:00,4,"So I finally bit the bullet and watched a Christmas movie. This was recommended by my sister. I didn't like it and will probably struggle to watch another Christmas movie this festive season.Such a talented cast completely gone to waste. I didn't really know what was happening with this. It managed to succeed in feeling like a lot was happening, without anything happen - all at the same time.It was oddly dark and depressive in a tiresome kind of way. Things were resolved randomly for no apparent reason. It didn't actually feel all that festive somehow either. There was too much arguing, not enough decent script and a whole lot of cringe.I had low expectations with it being a Christmas movie, but it still somehow disappointed me. I don't think anything actually happened. What plot? There was none. I now have this random urge to watch some action movie filled to the brim with savagery and violence.Well done on managing to fill an entire movie with no plot and nothing but irritating characters."
" Rotten tomatoes has this wrong.
",2020-12-20 00:00:00,2,"We watched and enjoyed this movie tonight.
Well done and as is typical not sure what critics don't see. Well acted and nice sub plots throughout, reminded us of Love Actually."
" Glorification and Normalisation of Divorce.
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,1,"Terrible Christmas Movie.With all that's wrong with the world right now, who on earth thinks it's acceptable to produce a Christmas movie like this."
" Excellent Christmas Movie!!!!
",2020-12-12 00:00:00,10,"I don't understand all the horrible, negative reviews of this movie!!! I absolutely LOVED it!
It truly is a very realistic portrayal of so many families today (dysfunction or not)...especially around the holidays. As a mother of four grown children, I can certainly relate to Diane Keaton's (the matriarch of the Cooper clan) character. When she was talking about how huge her love for her children was that it completely consumed her, I could definately see myself saying those very words. There was so many messages and ""words of wisdom"" in this movie that really makes you think and reevaluate your own life.
I may also be a little biased in my love of this movie because it was filmed in my hometown of Pittsburgh, so seeing my beautiful city, especially during the holidays, was an added bonus.
I highly recommend this movie and suggest that everyone make their own opinions and ignore all the haters and narrow minded people that gave such awful reviews"
" So, So Poor
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,1,"This is definitely in the running for the worst film I've ever seen, not least because it was convinced it was much cleverer than it was. What a waste of an impressive cast. Terrible acting, awful writing, cliches and tropes abounding. A thorough waste of time. It manages to be both sickeningly sweet whilst being full of awful, unredeemable characters. With the Christmas film market so saturated, do yourself a favour and watch something, anything else. It will probably also be bad but not to this extent. I am angry I wasted my time watching this film."
" I'm surprised by the good reviews!
",2020-12-01 00:00:00,3,"I love Christmas, I love Christmas movies and when we saw the cast even my Bah Humbug Husband was willing to watch it.I had to apologise to him for selecting it.The Character Eleanor, played by Olivia Wilde was so hugely unlikable it was totally unrealistic that she'd have poor Joe smitten by the end of the night!The casting decision for Diane Keaton's sister made no sense. Nothing against the actress but she looked like she could be her daughter! I think there's 20 years between the actresses yet the flashbacks from their childhoods suggest an age gap of about 5 years!! It didn't work.Only two enjoyable parts; Aunt Fishy letting the dog take the blame for her fart and the cute revelation at the end that the 'dog' had been the narrator/Steve Martin.That's all I've got. Cute dog. Crap film."
" Middle of the road
",2020-11-30 00:00:00,5,"A really good cast does not always a good movie make.... disjointed story lines are meant to come together, but doesn't there are too many and it doesn't really resolve. Ok though. I've seen worse."
" Don't Waste Your Time
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,1,"It has the billing to be an amazing film with a star studded cast. Unfortunately, the storyline was written by a pubescent teenager. Multiple boring and ironic stories all come to one at Christmas. All doom and gloom throughout the movie and then everything works out at the end. Far too predictable and easy. Storylines are rushed and aren't believable. If you want to see how good this movie could've been, I suggest you watch Love Actually"
" Like watching paint dry...
",2020-11-19 00:00:00,1,Here's 1hr 47mins of my life I'll never get back!SO DULL!!!!!
" Cheap Love Actually
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,6,"My view is that this film is trying so hard to mimic the various positive life changes or love stories like Love Actually. It is ok to watch as a 'get me in the mood for Christmas' B movie, but that's about as far as it goes. Ok, but wouldn't watch again, unlike Love Actually which gets better with every viewing."
" Diabolical
",2020-11-01 00:00:00,1,"One of the worst movies to grace our screens , which is disappointing for such a great cast.. if your looking for a good Christmas movie then I beg you to stay away from this."
" There is nothing to love about the Coopers but the dog
",2020-10-11 00:00:00,3,"This movie is a disgrace to all the wonderful dysfunctional family Christmas movies. Even the great ensemble cast can't save this trainwreck.The dog is wonderful tho, whatch it for the dog"
" The movie I didn't know I needed
",2020-06-02 00:00:00,9,"This is a star-studded, technically-non traditional, surprisingly good film. I expected a dumb family comedy based on my pre-judgement of seeing the IMDb ratings. Not only did I find this movie tremendous, but I found myself as madly in love with it as some of the characters do with each other. It's a movie for all ages, for cinephiles, for filmmakers who'd like to see cinematography and editing beyond most commercialized Christmas movies, and for Timothée Chalamet fans who want to see his dance moves pre-Call Me by Your Name. This film unearthed inner desires I didn't know I had and gave me a sense of hope I need right now. My only cruxes with this film are in its inescapable cheesiness, chaotic story structure of intertwining stories, and its ""twist"" ending that could've been avoided. Take away the commercialized Christmas glaze, leave the technical choices, leave the cast and their genuine performances, and cut out some of the ""happy ending"", prewritten/everything-lines-up-perfectly resolutions. Then, this film will be less of a critical/audience generic flop and more of a wholesome family drama. I intend on doing a full review of this film towards the holidays. I'll certainly update you around then."
" Barf.
",2020-04-27 00:00:00,3,Only giving 3 stars for the great lighting and perfect clichè of white and rich American families with amazing kitchens.
" I sobbed loudly alone in my room
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,10,"I am currently on the quest of watching everything Timothée Chalamet has been in, and I stumbled upon this Christmas movie. I have always loved Christmas movies. They make me feel warm inside. But this movie made me sob and touched me deeply. I recommend everyone to watch it, specially those with weird dysfunctional families. I loved it"
" Underrated lovely movie
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,10,"10/10 among the Christmas movies out there.
crap Love actually whish to be this movie"
" Depressing holiday movie
",2019-12-24 00:00:00,5,"Excellent cast, and decent story. But it is a very depressing holiday movie and it will not lift your spirits. I really wish I had not watched this one because it was a downer."
" LOVE THIS FILM
",2019-12-11 00:00:00,10,"Ok, I didn't think this film would be that Funny. But it was really funny. Love when that teenage boy found that girl. Giving her a Kiss was so BAD it was Hilarious.
Their big dog was awesome and love how grandma feed him off of her plate as she was eating. Then she just kept eating off the same plate. That just shows how much she loves him.
Oh, when he ate inside the MASHED POTATOES. Then at dinner time if you noticed most of the FAMILY KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE MASHED POATOES.
But nobody said anything they just kept eating them. There was some much wrong with this FAMILY it kind of reminded me of my MESSED UP FAMILY.
Oh and that other part when she went and got her MOM SOMETHING EXPENSIVE FROM THE HOSPITAL STORE.
What she got her was perfect for an OLDER COUPLE.
It was a stool for inside the shower. That had me in tears why. Because when we got one for GRANDMA. She thought it was totally Awesome."
" The only redeeming factor is the beautiful setting for Christmas
",2019-11-14 00:00:00,2,"With a cast of such well known actors, I though this movie would be at least okay but it is nothing but eye rolling dialogue & annoyances. I get that not all Christmas movies need to be wonderful feed good love & joy (although those are the ones I love to watch) but this creates a sea of horrible life relationships & makes nothing go right because of the way the characters deal with their issues & talk to their ""loved ones"" which is one of my biggest pet peeves in any movie.
If you're looking for a Christmas movie with realistic family dysfunction & Diane Keaton go with The Family Stone.. it's much better."
" This Should be Outlawed
",2019-07-24 00:00:00,1,The Great Film Critic Roger Ebert once wrote that No bad film is short enough.those thoughts kept coming to my head watching this cinematic miscarriage the other thought was whether or not I should Burn the Movie theatre that showed this along with whatever else is inside . The plot manages to make you pray for the sitcom cliche's of yesteryear.Well anyway the Coopers are your normal bickering disfunctional family number 5078 and the whole film just disintegrates into either unfunny skits of the family around town or melodrama that Twilight look like citizen kane. The Best bit about this film is very simply you don't remember much about it after it's over so props
" Boo to the haters
",2019-07-06 00:00:00,8,Awesome feel good Christmas movie. Fantastic cast. Loved John Goodman. Olivia Wilde and jake Lacey. Great intertwining stories. Loved it
" A shame
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,4,Such a strong cast give us a poor Christmas movie. Watched this at the cinema with the family and we all came out disappointed
" All over the map...
",2019-01-30 00:00:00,5,"The Story: It was a holiday movie, a happy ending. Too much going on, so many casts, so many different own life story. It was hard to really focus on specific family members.The Directing: Because there were story of each family member (big family too), the movie was all over the map. Even though at the end they were trying to bring all the stories together..... it didn't seem complete and interesting."
" Not Good Enough
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,2,"It is not a myth that movies with all star cast are flops. This one proves it once again, though it tries harder to present a deeper understanding of the characters and the holidays. The Coopers are trying to present a jolly image for the christmas holidays, that aims to cover their real probelms. If the story had followed one or two characters, than it would have been an actually decent movie. However, they meddled with too many plots and leads to follow and it ended up a half baked mess. So, 2 out of 10."
" On Netflix it's called ""Christmas Coopers""
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,5,"Just correcting the name for imbd users!Good cast, nothing special..."
" It is okay
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,4,"I thought that this movie was okay, I thought by having the family all go through different things and not wanting to disappoint each other did make this different from other Christmas movies however I did find that it did get a little boring to watch and it came across rather choppy and that the narrator did interrupt the flow."
" Sappy, formulaic, but still liked it
",2018-12-22 00:00:00,8,"I was surprised to see so many negative reviews, but in reading them, I think I understand why.1. If I'd paid for it, I'd have been disappointed, as the cast is perhaps not used as the might have been.
2. The characters are indeed over-the-top, perhaps unbelievably so.
3. You do know where most of the story lines are going.But there's still a lot here to enjoy:1. It is a very good cast, many of whom probably decided to do the film because it's heartwarming.
2. The characters are indeed over-the-top, perhaps unbelievably so.
3. There are some sweet twists.
4. The narrator is the dog.It's a nice reminder that holidays can be stressful but our families are just as screwed up as we are, and that we can still love them."
" Deserves far more than 5.7
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,9,"Maybe being little older I like to watch a film at Xmas where you feel you know where it's going and a nice little ending. Just wanted a little laugh and mice story and that's what you get. Not side splitting just feel good.
Glad I stumbled on this gem, wiith some great actors like Alan Arkin."
" Like The Family Stone but Better!
",2018-12-14 00:00:00,10,"This movie is super cute. It's a lot like the family stone (which also stars Diane Keaton). A great ensemble cast makes it even better. While this might not be a Christmas classic, it's one I can watch year after year."
" This movie had potential...
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,5,"OK:
I think they did a decent job with this movie, it did keep my attention and there were a couple funny moments, along with a few sweet ones. I think they did a good job on the location and feeling of this movie. Plus they showed lots of pooches, which is always a plus in my book.Meh:
One thing I just could not get over was Olivia Wilde's horrible character, I am sorry, were we supposed to like her or even care? The woman was awful. There is no way a guy, let alone a stranger, would put up with her borderline-hate filled comments. Putting down his religion, his service and father. Also, it is hard to care about someone who admits to sleeping with a married man and seems to have no qualms about it. Then the back and forth of the guy ""leaving"" only to come right back within minutes, after more of her verbal combative and rude comments. I hate it when they make characters so cynical and emotionally cut off for whatever fill in the blank moment, but this ONE stranger can thaw their icy heart in a matter of days/weeks...in this case HOURS. Then at the end when she dashes to find him? SHE STRAIGHT UP KNOCKS OVER SOMEONE IN A HOSPITAL GURNEY?!?!?! Runs smack dab into about 7 people, one carrying a beautiful flower bouquet, what if these people were going to see their dying loved ones?? Hated this character and woman, awful, awful, awful.Few other things I thought were pretty dumb:
Teenagers literally slapping tongues together - stupid.The relationship between the old guy and waitress - what?Marissa Tomei's character ""calling"" everything about a total stranger and hitting it all on the head.Marissa Tomei's character being Diane Keaton's sister??? They are like 25 years about, she could be her daughter, but in the flashbacks they are like 4-7 years apart? Yeah, right.Diane Keaton and John Goodman's characters that allllllll the sudden in the last 3 minutes decide they are madly in love again because she finally agrees to go to Africa, even though the whole movie is them and their broken relationship. Should have put more effort into that resolution.The end scene of everyone dancing in the fanciest hospital I have ever seen in my life. CORN BALL STEW."
" Don't believe the hype (the bad hype)
",2018-11-24 00:00:00,8,"I've just watched this film the first time last night on Netflix , and yes halfway through the film I was starting to get frustrated at its jumpy plot line however by the end of the film you can't help feel that it comes together, granted it's not the most complete script, the greatest screenplay, but there is something so relatable about this film that you can't help feel warm inside watching it - and I guess Christmas films aren't meant to be masterpieces in any form , it was everything you wanted a Christmas film to be , cheesy in parts , predictable at times , cliche and overwhelmingly endearing. Although every review I've seen of this has been very harsh - I can't help but disagree, I thought it did the job of what it as meant to do , and how can you hold a grudge over that? I will however state that I feel during the Christmas period any s****y film will do the job, however this one seems to hit the mark and stay there And come on the narrator is a dog voiced by Steve Martin!"
" An obvious and failed attempt to create a Christmas classic.
",2018-11-17 00:00:00,2,"I could only stomach an hour of this movie before I had to bail. The thing about the classics is that they were/are authentic in a way that can't be reproduced, and the problem with movies like this - the ""pretenders"" - is that they are riding the coattails of a gimmick of some sort, in this case a vast cast of characters played by well known and beloved actors. This is a movie that was created with everyone thinking this is going to be a hit like Love Actually, and they try to hit all the right notes, only to come out sounding sour. And please, can we just put to rest some of the more annoying cliches found in this movie: the addled senior who speaks more truth than anyone else (there is nothing cute or wise about dementia sufferers), the foul-mouthed child who is neither adorable nor funny, the love-struck -angsty teen, the out-of-control dog who destroys everything in its path, and the idea that there are troops of Victorian-clad Christmas carolers around every corner at Christmas time. This is not a good movie, and is an obvious attempt to cash in on the spirit of Christmas movies past."
" Scattered nonsense
",2018-10-27 00:00:00,1,"This movie was nothing more than boring, nonsensical, scattered vignettes. It was doing the whole I'll show you this character's life, and then I'll show you this character's life, and then I'm going to amaze you because... Wait for it, they're all related! We've seen this before. Other directors have done it so much better. You will be bored. I got to the part where the cop came out to the psychoanalyst/ housewife that was in his backseat. And I was done."
" Bland Christmas movie, but not entirely devoid of merit
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,5,"It's bland, it's predictable, it tries too much to be interesting, but actually isn't.But, there are some redeeming qualities. For example, this is probably the best role for Olivia Wilde after 13 of House fame. Finally someone got it that she's not a great actress since she ain't got a great range, but, if well cast, can do a fine job. Don't try to make her very sexy. She's hot because she's interesting (looks and brains, both), not because she's very sexy.Also, depicting an extended family and various ways people interact in those is good. Not great or very insightful, mind you, but, still, good.The dog telling the story and having a ""stress eating"" episode seeing how crazy his human hosts behave also works nice.But, that's about it. Everything else is at most mildly interesting/fun/funny, but mostly just bland. If that's enough for you, by all means, watch it."
" Max's dog's eye view
",2018-09-01 00:00:00,7,"This is one quirky Christmas movie about a large and extended family named 
Cooper, four generations of them gather for Christmas dinner and the whole
proceeding is viewed by the family pooch Max whose voice is that of Steve Martin.
A gambit going all the way back to Jackie Cooper's TV series People's Choice.John Goodman and Diane Keaton are the Cooper parents and there's a ton of
kids and grandkids. there and expecting. All bring their little problems and 
angsts to mommy and daddy as if Goodman and Keaton don't have enough of
their own.Standing out is young Timothee Chalamet who comes across like a real kid in
this as opposed to a Hollywood kid. Tim is one of their grandkids dealing with
both hormonal pangs and a bully and not doing well with either.Love The Coopers is a fine, but different kind of Yuletide film."
" Ensemble movie with a weak plot
",2018-05-07 00:00:00,4,"Incredibly predictable plot. I could have written a better version of this staple plot device. Yes, everyone's family has disagreements that can intrude on holiday celebrations. Please, at least make the cast small enough that you can have some character development. A great bunch of actors wasted."
" New Classic
",2018-01-11 00:00:00,3,This cute family story is well played by the talented lineup of actors. It should become a new family classic to entertain old and young!
" Love the Coopers (or hate them)
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,4,"I watched this movie just because it was on the TV and I got nothing better to do. And this is the typical Christmas holiday movie, but it is entertaining and funny.It tells the story of various members from the Cooper family and how they get to arrive to the Christmas Dinner. As in this kind of movies, there are a lot of characters and you might connect better with ones than others. For example, I think Amanda Seyfried here was misused, and she could have give more, as well as others like the little kids needed less time on-screen (that's also usual in this movies). The characters I liked the most are Eleanor portrayed by a beautiful Olivia Wilde and Sam portrayed by John Goodman. It's not that the acting is superb but for me they were some of the best of the movie.Of course it's not a perfect movie. Since the beginning you probably will guess how it will end. It's full of clichés of romantic-holiday movies but it's still very enjoyable. Watch it if you want to have a good time, and I think this movie is specially made for Christmas time, so better if you watch in that time."
" Delightful holiday family comedy
",2017-04-26 00:00:00,7,"Love the Coopers (2015) is a fun, delightful holiday film about a family coming together for Christmas dinner. I loved the ensemble cast. I'm a big fan of most of the actors. Marisa Tomei, Diane Keaton, Olivia Wilde, John Goodman, and others all star as members of the Cooper family. They all give very good performances, I especially loved Olivia Wilde's performance. I loved her storyline with her and her man she met on the way to meet her family. The chemistry between the two is electric, I liked the dialogue between the two, it was both funny at times and sweet and touching. And I also liked following the other family members stories and the script allows for the audience to get invested in the characters and see deep into why they are the way they are. I thought that Marisa Tomei and her storyline with the police officer was very interesting and it really gave a look into her character. Keaton and goodman are great together and I loved their story and seeing them go through what they were going through. Overall love the coopers isn't out of this world, but it is a sweet fun way to spend a couple hours, especially over Christmastime. 7/10 for love the coopers."
" Did They Even Try?
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,1,"So, I saw this with my family last Christmas, and I completely hated it. The story line made no sense. They bounced scenarios around with no real rhyme or reason, constantly switching back and forth: 1. A struggling husband and wife, 2. A sister who meets a soldier and convinces him to act like her fiancé 3. An old man talking to a teenage waitress, 4. A teenager trying to kiss a girl, 5. and a woman being arrested and becoming buddy-buddy with a cop. It honestly felt like they had 5 different movie ideas and mashed them into one. The acting was poor, the ending was bad. OK, spoiler: The old man has heart attack. He lives (Of course) So, dancing in a hospital = family? I saw it just because of the trailer, but that was the only real ""Good"" things about the movie. This movie is billed as a ""Comedy"". I didn't even chuckle once."
" What a mess
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,5,"This isn't the weirdest movie I ever saw, but it's high on the list. Although, weird doesn't necessarily mean bad. But, in this case, weird is kinda bad. This is a sort of ensemble-type film, and you either like or don't like some of the individual subplots.Sub-plot 1: John Goodman and Diane Keaton are planning on divorcing, with the precipitating factor being her refusal to go on a long-planned trip to Africa with him. But they want to have one last ""regular"" Christmas before they tell their family. This subplot is fine, although with age I think that Keaton has slightly lost her touch, and I never thought Goodman had the touch. As a result, while the subplot is fine, I wasn't that impressed with the acting in it.Sam and Charlotte are divorcing after forty years of marriage. Charlotte convinces Sam to wait until after their grown children (Hank and Eleanor), grandchildren (Hank's kids Charlie, Bo and Madison), Charlotte's father and sister (Bucky and Emma) and Sam's aunt (Fishy) have enjoyed one last ""perfect Christmas"" before announcing the planned divorce. As scenes shift back and forth across the Cooper family members, their memories also briefly appear on screen as younger versions of themselves.Subplot 2: Hank lost his photography job and his wife has left him, though she has flown in for the holiday Christmas. This just didn't work for me. Too much hand-wringing.Subplot 3: Eleanor has flown in for the holiday, but stays at the airport as long as possible because she dreads going home...although it was never clear to me why she dreaded it. The motherly nagging was pretty minor. At an airport bar she meets a soldier snowed in at the airport...even though there's not that much of a snowfall. They hit it off, though they are very different people. He agrees to act as her boyfriend for Christmas so that her mother will lay off the nagging. I didn't find Eleanor a very sympathetic character, although this part of the story was SOMETIMES intriguing.Subplot 4: Bucky -- the grandfather -- is eats daily at a local diner because he so admires a young waitress who hasn't gotten her life together. It's sort of charming, but I was never quite clear what his intentions were. Good...or a dirty old man? This was, at least, an interesting subplot.Subplot 5: The high school boy, awkward as can be, has a crush on a girl. They finally get together, but their Frenching and humping in public is illogical and disgusting.Subplot 6: Emma (sister to Keaton) gets arrested for shoplifting during Christmas shopping. She is arrested by a police officer played by Anthony Mackie. In the police car they get into a conversation in which the officer admits (sort of) that he is gay and that his personal life is a disaster. Okay. That sorta works...except Mackie is only a prop here because he lets her go because it's Christmas. Unfortunately, for Mackie, it's a dead end part.Finally it's Christmas dinner...and it's disastrous, resulting in an unexplained power failure during which Bucky suffers a stroke (yes, really). At the hospital they all kiss...well, dance and make up.Honestly, this film stinks, but has just enough good scenes that I couldn't turn it off. Perhaps most interesting is that the story is told by the dog (I'm not kidding), with voice portrayed by Steve Martin.To be honest, don't waste your time."
" What a thoughtful, fun movie!
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,9,"So many of these movie reviews seem to be from ""want-to-be"" critics, far more interested in critiquing the movie, than enjoying it. Sometime I feel I may be the only one who watches movies simply to relax and be entertained? This movie was great. I had never heard of it before it popped up on TV. With so many characters being introduced, it seemed a little confusing at first trying to fit them together. Once I caught on to the several subplots going on, it was just really wonderful fun. An adult movie that doesn't rely of car chases, sex and gun fire to entertain. I laughed WITH this family and AT this family. What a hoot. Watch it for pure fun."
" Almost flawless in its class
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,8,"Christmast 'romcom' is a unique genre where maximum score is 8 (out of 10) as it is inevitably full of cliché.I had to give this maximum score as this movie brings virtually everything it has to: divorce, unemployment, shame, affront, loud quarrel -- and the catharsis, the resolution we all longing for, but many people are afraid to admit that.The ""extras"" I decided to sit down in front of the computer this evening was a discussion between two characters: one recalls her parents hate each other since they are fighting on every subtle matter -- the other recalls his parents love each other since they are fighting on every subtle matter, this is not hate but blood, passion.The opposite of love is not hate. The opposite of love is indifference."
" good holiday film
",2017-01-20 00:00:00,8,"This was a decent holiday/family comedy film following several story lines. Among them were scenes with Dianne Wiest and John Goodman, Marisa Tomei being arrested for shoplifting, Amanda Seyfried about to quit her job at a diner (much to the chagrin of her favorite customer), and one of the daughters picking up a soldier at the airport so she can pass him off as her ""lover"" for her family for the family at the dinner. The whole thing is narrated by Steve Martin-you might be surprised by who his character is. My favorite scenes are John Goodman messing up the lyrics to the Christmas scenes;Seyfried's scenes at the diner;the scenes in the police car;and the scenes between Olivia Wilde and the soldier. You might want to check this out if you need a good family holiday film.** 1/2 out of ****"
" It's the movie to be jolly
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,7,"A festive movie about family, about values, about love and everything else. With a little twist at the end if you want to call it that. Other than that it is pretty much by the numbers (predictable that is). But it's a fun movie to watch and it's lovely to see another story about family interactions.If you like that kind of stuff that is. But it's light (drama included of course) and it's fun overall. The acting talent at hand is amazing and it's clear they're having a blast. I guess watching it around Christmas time makes the most sense, but you could also watch it anytime else and still have that good feeling"
" Predictable and not that funny! 2/10
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,2,"Review: I wasn't a big fan of this movie because I got fed up with the constant moaning from the various characters, who really had nothing to moan about. Its based around a dysfunctional family, who are getting together for Christmas at the family home but the mother and father of the family, Sam Cooper (John Goodman) and Charlotte (Diane Keaton) are having problems with there marriage, because they have grown apart since the kids have left home. Charlotte's sister, Emma (Marisa Tomei) is jealous of her sisters huge family, and she is caught stealing a present for her, whilst shopping in a department store. Officer Williams (Anthony Mackie) has to chaperone her to the local police station but after bonding in the police car, he decides to take her to the family home. Meanwhile, Charlotte's daughter, Eleanor (Olivia Wilde) becomes friends with a soldier, Joe (Jake Lacy) whilst drinking at the airport bar, and she manages to convince him to act like he is her boyfriend, so her prying mother will stop going on about how disappointed she is with her life. Charlotte's father, Bucky (Alan Arkin) falls for a waitress, Ruby (Amanda Seyfried), who makes him feel young and has the same interests as her but he doesn't make it known to Ruby, mainly because of the age difference. He asks her to come to the family home for Christmas, as she has decided to leave her job to pursue her dream. Charlotte's son, Hank (Ed Helms) is going through a divorce to Angie (Alex Borstein), so he is constantly searching for a job to support his kids. With Sam's senile Auntie, Aunt Fishy (June Squibb) and the family dog Rags (voiced by Steve Martin), also around the family dinner table at Christmas, all hell breaks lose when they finally get together, and Bucky takes a turn for the worse, which eventually brings the family together. I really did try to get into this film but the storyline was weak and the characters wasn't that interesting. The script also became a bit annoying, especially between Keaton and Goodman who were arguing about complete rubbish, and the witty side of the movie wasn't that funny. With such an impressive cast, I was totally let down with this film but I'm sure that dysfunctional families will enjoy it. Disappointing! Round-Up: This movie was directed by Jessie Nelson, who also brought you I Am Sam starring Sean Penn and Corrina, Corrina with Ray Liotta. She also wrote and produced Fred Claus, Because I Said So, The Story of Us, Stepmom and Danny Collins. Although I didn't really find this movie that interesting, it did make a profit at the box office, mainly because it was released close to Christmas. I couldn't see were the budget went, and I personally think that the director didn't take full advantage of the cast but on a good note, it does have a sweet ending, which was quite predictable.Budget: $17million Worldwide Gross: $42.4millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies, starring Steve Martin, Diane Keaton, John Goodman, Ed Helms, Alex Borstein, Amanda Seyfried, Alan Arkin, Dan Amboyer, Marisa Tomei, Olivia Wilde, Anthony Mackie and June Squibb. 2/10"
" Do Not Love The Coopers.
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,4,"I went and saw the film, The Family Stone, in theatres when it first came out. It received mixed reviews, but for the most part, I really liked it. It dealt with a dysfunctional family getting together for the holidays. What made it work, in my mind at least, was that the characters felt honest, the chemistry between the cast felt real and despite the many dramatic moments, it had some heart. Love The Coopers is a poor imitation of these things. I bring up The Family Stone as a apt comparison, not only because Diane Keaton is the matriarch, but because both films try to convey the same message. The Family Stone's shortcomings happens in the final act with the girlfriend ""switcheroo"" whereas Love The Coopers shortcomings is the entire film.The film follows one family and their stories on Christmas Day. Keaton and her husband, John Goodman, are having one more family get together before they ultimately decide to leave each other after 40 years of marriage...depressing. Ed Helms is the son, separated from his wife, unemployed and feeling less of a man and even lesser of a father...depressing. Then we have Alan Arkin, the grandfather, who eats at the same diner everyday just to have a conversation with the pretty waitress, Amanda Seyfried, and to convince her she has value in this world....depressing. The beautiful Olivia Wilde plays the daughter. She is on her way home and is wasting time at the airport so she can spend less time with her family. She meets a good looking young soldier and convinces him to come home with her so she doesn't have to be a disappointment to her mother...depressing. On top of that...yes, there is more...we have Diane Keaton's sister, who has a strained relationship and shoplifts some jewelry for a present, only to get caught and have a thoughtful one on one conversation with a police officer...you guessed it....depressing. Did I forget to mention that the sister is played by Marissa Tomei? Yes, Marissa Tomei, so there lies a big problem for me. The casting of this film is all over the place. It seems they wanted to cast the recognizable face and name and not the role. In this film, we have constant 'flashes of memories' of the characters when they were younger. So we flash to the sisters when they were kids. They are maybe, 3 to 5 years apart. Then we come to the present and discover that the sister is Diane Keaton and Marissa Tomei. They have a 20 year age difference between each other. On top of that Alan Arkin plays their father....he is 12 years older than Keaton. I was so confused as to how Arkin and Tomei fit into the picture for 75% of the film. I thought he was Goodman's brother and Tomei was Keaton's daughter. While the cast does a decent job in the roles, none of the material is strong enough to hold any weight. None of the stories are engaging and it tries so hard to be emotional. I didn't really care about Goodman and Keaton's failing marriage because it never feels like the characters are really trying, or love each other, or anything at all really. The strained relationship between Keaton and almost everyone feels fake. None of these stories really work for me with the weakest one being Helms. He literally has nothing to do in this film, it's a little sad actually. Even for a 'depressing' Christmas film, Coopers fails. For it to be depressing, I feel like we need to have some sort of attachment to the characters, I had none. Steve Martin narrates the film to give it a ""Christmas story"" feel, it also falls a little flat. I just couldn't find myself caring about anything here."
