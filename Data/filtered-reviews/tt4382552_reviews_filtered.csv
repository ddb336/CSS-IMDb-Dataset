" Choose Your Words Better....
",2021-03-23 00:00:00,6,"First, let's get one thing straight, NONE of these ""girls"" are being taken advantage of. They are ALL MORE than aware of what is going on, and no one has held a gun to their heads. THEY LOVE the attention and the fast cash, and the paid-for lifestyle. They are fully aware of what is happening, and anyone who thinks they are innocent and being taken advantage of is a complete moron. These girls LOVE the attention, in the age of ""followers"" and ""likes"" these vapid people thrive on this crap. This is more a movie showing how they are living than it is an exploitation film. They all come willingly, they all log on willingly and they are doing what they want for money. In the age of ""every woman is strong and intelligent"" how can people say these are being taken advantage of? GIVE ME A BREAK. THEY LOVE THE MONEY AND LIFESTYLE."

" MEH
",2020-06-10 00:00:00,2,"If you're gonna make a documentary about the adult industry you need to SHOW it. It's like making a documentary about cops without showing what they do.Just having interviews and having them lounge at home isn't interesting. Why not take a girl from beginning to end and follow her, it took almost an hour before there was some sort of story, but too late? There should have been more of an arc. Watching these people go to the zoo is not a documentary. This was more of a home video than a documentary. There was no story, just random clips of girls hanging.What a bore. Make it sexy, daring, and provocative. Otherwise, what is the point? We don't learn very much from this.What a missed opportunity. Skip it."
" The Antidote to Priapism
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,2,"A better title would have been, UGLY GUYS WANTED. This doc will make you never want to have sex again. Cat crap ugly, mommy-issued, misogynistic old men taking advantage of girls that are hardly legal. It sucks that porn is all about degradation and humiliation these days. I remember a time when it approached an artform. A new low in human abjection and self-esteem. Yuck. I needed a Silkwood shower after viewing this."
" unimpressed
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,7,"After watching this, I do think some of these girls specifically Ava Kelly, Ava Taylor and the girl who never told her father she did porn, are not cut out for the job, they don't have the guts to do it so they downplay the porn actresses who really are professionals and those who became succesful porn actresses like Rile Reid, Lana Rhoades, Asa Akira etc...We all make choices in life, they chose porn, some chose to work at Mc Donalds or become a waitress at Hooters, how is your life more important than us because you're in porn?"
" All professions are very hard and there are no simple jobs
",2019-02-19 00:00:00,5,All professions are very hard and there are no simple jobs. The key is to see what you want and what you are willing to give. The whole documentary has a positive style. The reality and problems it talks about are superficial.
" Eye opening
",2017-08-22 00:00:00,8,"An eye-opening documentary which follows a girl and some of her co-workers just starting out in ""the industry."" Totally a must watch. I am almost tempted to watch the follow up to this but I honestly do want to see anymore. It is just to sad to watch these girls getting taken advantage of by these twisted people out to make cash at any cost. And apparently the average girl doesn't even last a year! So there will be a bunch of dirty videos of the poor girl up on the internet forever just because she was naive and did not know what she was getting into. Why hasn't anyone tried to regulate this industry yet? There are a zillion Bible-thumping congressmen and senators but not a single one is doing anything about this? I smell backroom deals and payoffs."
" More like stupid, vacuous girls wanted
",2017-08-04 00:00:00,1,"If only the girls in this documentary can see how they look. I can only imagine in ten years or so how they're going to feel. I felt zero sympathy for them with the exception of their parents and relatives.By the way the money isn't really that good compared to industry professionals who make much more. Let us also not forget that a large percentage of porn watchers are women and girls themselves.If they were going for poor me it didn't work at all for me. In fact I turned it off about halfway because I couldn't stand the idiotic girls.Sell your soul for a few bucks, live with the consequences for all time."
