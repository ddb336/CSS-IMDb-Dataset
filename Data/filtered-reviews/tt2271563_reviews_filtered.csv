" Pretty Good Movie
",2021-04-07 00:00:00,7,Pretty good movie overall. Location awesome! The writing is a bit dull.
" Kiefer Sutherland Shines
",2021-03-07 00:00:00,8,"First of all, the scenery was magnificent, and beautifully filmed. Kiefer Sutherland did a masterful job with his role, providing a reserved, believable, former gunfighter who truly had changed his ways. I noticed subtle nuances in his mannerisms that accurately displayed inner changes in his character from his earlier days. I liked that he never once made a romantic overture to the Demi Moore character, who married someone else in town while he was away for eight years. What really disturbed me was the use of the F-word in this movie. Totally unnecessary, and while a character may have talked that way in 1872, it could have been deleted or substituted for by use of a less offensive profanity. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, although I had hoped for a duel at the end, similar to what is shown at the beginning of every Gunsmoke episode. This scenario was more accurate, but a duel would have been more satisfying."
" One of my favorites
",2021-01-23 00:00:00,10,"There's a few Western movies I like more, but not very many.The plot is slow, and you know exactly what it's building up to, yet the ending still takes you by surprise.Quick overview: Son of a town pastor takes off to fight in the civil war but seeing battle and broken dying men crying out to God for help and those cries going unanswered causes a crisis of faith. He becomes a hired gun hand and later returns home, but mom and dad heard about the life choices he made after the war, so mom died with a broken heart and the strained relationship between father and son don't look like it's going to improve.Meanwhile the town has a railroad making its way and one resident has decided that he wants to get as much land as he can before the railroad arrives. He is willing to pay for the properties, but some residents need convinced that it's a good idea to sell.So you have a gun slinger who's trying to escape the life and mend his estranged relationship with his father while a crook is going around ""convincing"" farmers to sell the land to him.Another ""this ain't a Christan film, but man, I sure do wish Christan films would learn from this"" situation. A great twist to the prodigal son story.Great movie that if Christians made would have some serious secular appeal, can't recommend enough"
" How the West was lost.
",2021-01-20 00:00:00,3,The cinematography was excellent. Donald Sutherland outstanding. The rest of the cast was pathetic. With a story line equally as bad. Two gunslingers that refuse to fight each other. Yet they have no problem killing everyone else. Then there's Demi the long lost girlfriend committed to another man. Her acting ability is equivalent to sitting in a dentist chairs for hours.
" An old movie
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,5,It feels like seeing an old movie written for John Wayne.
" Missed Opportunity
",2021-01-13 00:00:00,5,"This is a man removes his guns, man picks up his guns kind of movie.The acting is nice from the Sutherlands.Aside from that there is not a lot of reason to watch this movie.
I am a fan of the genre but this movie needed more bite either from the action or a deeper character analysis. Sadly we get neither.Far from the worst movie you will ever see but is that a good thing?"
" Father and Son working together at commonplace western!!!
",2020-11-18 00:00:00,6,"Father and son working together for the first time is quite unusual on cinema industry, the great Donald Sutherland and his skilled descendant Kiefer had this fabulous experience on this neo western, according Kiefer he was pretty worried to let down his hero, the story is about John Henry (Kiefer) who return from the civil war to his home's father Reverend Samuel Clayton (Donald) after a hiatus of ten years wandering as the hired gun, at father's farm he finds an embittered father, also his mother already dead, worst at his childhood years Henry and his little brother went at river sadly the young boy drowned there, henceforth John Henry blames himself for his young brother's life, what makes him back at home was an accidental death of a another little boy for a stray bullet on a shooting against two bandits, afterwards John Henry decides retire of the killings and living an unwarlike life with his old father whom planned reconcile, however a railroad will be pass by the city, the heartless and greedy James McCurdy (Brian Cox) contracted several hired guns to enforce all settlers selling their lands at gunpoint, if not they'll straight to the graveyard, now the new adept of non-violence John Henry is abased deeply, upon the leadership of the smooth gentlemen David Turner (Michael Wincott) what is the only of the gang who don't overlook the limits of John Henry, the plot is far-fetched and unsatisfying at least, moreover too much commonplace, Kiefer and the director seek make something nearest of those old classic western, they didn't got the aim, even had the female presence of Demi Moore, the outcome was an average intent!!!Resume:First watch: 2020 / How many: 1 / Source: DVD / Rating: 6.5"
" Great slow building modern western
",2020-10-17 00:00:00,8,"I hate to compare this to Unforgiven, as that movie probably ranks #1 as my favorite modern western, but this movie is pretty good and has that similar tempo and is more about the character development, a slow building story, and most importantly realistic feel vs. a lot of mindless unrealistic shootouts.While I don't think anything can compare to the power and screen presence Hackman, Freeman, and of course Eastwood brought in Unforgiven, but Forsaken does a good job and has some memorable acting of it's own. Kiefer is a versatile actor and while I don't think a cowboy is his best fit, he did well, but mostly I thought Michael Wincott who I've only seen in a couple other movies really shined here. My only regret is I wish he had more screen time as he stole every scene he was in, including the ones with Kiefer. I didn't realize Demi Moore was in the movie until she showed up, which was a pleasant surprise, although she too has a small roleInterestingly I didn't think the scenes with the Southerlands were that much of a standout, and given IMDB's low 6.3 rating at the time of me watching & writing this review, was the main reason I took a leap of faith and watched the movie to begin with. Mainly to see the dynamic of those two on the screen together, playing father & son, but in the end it wasn't any more fulfilling or memorable than two decent actors playing father & son. I wouldn't call this a let down and I don't really know what I was expecting, that said I will look up some other Michael Wincott movies as I just thought he stole the showTo sum up, no this isn't Unforgiven by any stretch, it didn't have that score, level of depth or acting level, but it is a similar type of a western and is definitely entertaining and worth of a watch if you like westerns. IMDB is kind of funny though and generally what I've found is 9=A, 8=B, 7=C & 6=D and anything below a 6 is an F which I typically won't ever watch. So I almost passed this by and am glad I didn't as I personally rate it a C+ / B-, certainly better than the D- that it has now..."
" A fantastic and emotional story..
",2020-09-03 00:00:00,10,Watching a real son and dad working together packed with talent is an amazing thing to watch. Forsaken is a defenent sleeper and if you haven't seen this movie give it a shot.
" Alternately tedious and unpleasant.
",2020-06-26 00:00:00,2,This is of the genre where we know everything that will happen within the first ten minutes. The movie spends most of its hour and a half convincing the obvious hero to do the obvious. The obvious solution takes maybe ten minutes. There are no enjoyable or interesting scenes to carry you through the first hour and a quarter.
" Sutherland's are Superb!
",2020-04-29 00:00:00,10,"This is one Western Movie that I can actually let my children watch. Has just enough violence to support the story. The father and son relationship drama is so real and heartbreaking, it made me cry. Donald and Kiefer delivered extraordinary performances."
" Blew my mind, wow!
",2020-02-02 00:00:00,10,"Had no idea this film would be this good with fantastic acting and real-life chemistry between father Donald and son Kiefer. Very powerful and we should all feel cheated that we didn't see these two acting together more. Storyline was good. I found camera shots and backgrounds were even more beautiful than other reviewers tried to explain. Classic battle between man's conscience, inner peace and necessary violence to ensure that peace. Passed the ""can I watch this with my Dad or Mom"" test for nudity and frivolous violence. Don't pass this one up if you like Westerns!"
" Really enjoyed this
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,8,"I grew up watching westerns with my Grandpa. I've got a big soft spot for them. This one made my Saturday night without the kids and husband! The cinematography was gorgeous. The storyline was engaging. Heck, I even tested up a bit!"
" Great movie
",2019-10-31 00:00:00,10,"First let me say I'm a big fan of western. This movie was great !!
Good story Keifer & his Dad both did a good job without one trying
To outshine thee other. I was impressed. The supporting actors
Were good as well. ( Demi was great even though her part was small) I enjoyed the characters..
Even the villains !! I've watched it a few times & get something more
Out of it each time. Its a meat &
Potaoes movie, meaning it lacks
Nothing."
" A nicely made western
",2019-04-25 00:00:00,8,Forsaken is a western drama movie starring the Father son duo of Sutherland and is directed by Jon Cassar.The movie is about the relationship between father and son and based in 1872.The plot of the movie is very predictable but it's gripping and has the necessary ingredients to keep you engaged.The acting by the senior and junior Sutherland is good so as direction. Screenplay could've been little better and Demi Moore has also did justice with her character.Location is beautiful so as background music.Overall a nice western movie.
" Beautifully crafted.
",2018-11-14 00:00:00,8,"A truly classic Western comes along (like 'Unforgiven') and then a few others follow. Kefer Sutherland, is possibly one of the very first offspring to match his father. He's matured into such a purposeful, thoughtful actor and delivers the dialog (together with Donald.S in the same film), with such a skillful ability. I'm very partial to Western yarns and with this type of material, everyone else should be to."
" 6.7/10 Un poco triste, pero valió la pena verla #netfix

" I thought I was done with killing. She just wasn't done with me.
",2018-02-27 00:00:00,8,"John Henry Clayton (Kiefer Sutherland) returns to his western home sometime after the Civil War. He discovers Donald Sutherland (Rev. Clayton) is still alive and doing films while his mother has died. Rev. Clayton does everything he can to make his son feel unwanted, but to no avail, he stays. We then discover some bad guys are forcing the ranchers to sell their land. We don't know why, but this is a theme of half the western films out there, normally involving either the railroad or goldmine. John Henry has an old girlfriend (Demi Moore) that has moved on without him. If you have ever seen a western before you got a pretty good idea what happens...even the lines got to be predictable.In spite of this being identical to so many westerns and Donald Sutherland pontificates in too many scenes, the film was done well for fans of the genre. Keifer gives us one fine emotional scene in the church and I liked the original title ""Redemption"" a bit better.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity"
" The Sutherlands deserve better than this (spoilers)
",2017-09-26 00:00:00,4,"A retired gunslinger John Henry Clayton (Kiefer Sutherland) returns back to his home town after being away for 10 years (part of his time was spent in the war and part of it was spent drifting around). He returns to make amends with his father but also learns that his mother has died recently. John is determined to turn his back on his old ways, but when he learns that the townsfolk are being bullied and killed by a ruthless gang of land-grabbers it seems that John may have to come out of retirement to save the town.The big draw about this film is seeing the Sutherlands appearing on screen together and to be fair to both men they both give committed and excellent performances, but aside from that, a couple of other good performances and a reasonably tense and well-executed finale I'm struggling to find much else to praise about this film to be honest...Slow-burn seems to be the approach that Cassar has adopted here and in the early stages this is OK, but there is a fine line between something being slow-burning and boring and unfortunately, for the most part, Forsaken falls into the latter camp. The fraught relationship between father and son was interesting at first, but the threads connecting the story lines don't seem to add up to a great deal (despite the emotional weight that they seem to carry). The villains of the piece here aren't particularly intimidating and many of them seem more like ridiculous caricatures (with the exception of Wincott whose understated performance is actually pretty good). All these things combined create a vacuum in the middle of the picture which essentially sucks the life out of the film - I could have also done without the sub-plot involving Demi Moore's character as John's old flame which felt unnecessary and again dragged the picture down somewhat.Narratively, the film is also slightly problematic in the way that a lot of the land-grabbers don't seem to fear John in spite of his reputation. It also doesn't make sense that when they do get the better of him that they allow him to live??? Why would you allow the one man capable of stopping you to live?? Of course, it's to set up the inevitable showdown and to allow John to save the day, but you would think that if the land-grabbers had any brains that they would have eliminated the threat at an early stage - him being retired could have been a bluff for all they know.There is a fairly well-executed final shootout which almost makes up for the dreary and lifeless hour and a bit that preceded it, but on the whole I found Forsaken to be drawn-out, mawkish, overly-sentimental and worst of all unexciting. All in all it has some selling points and isn't all bad, but there was an awful lot of it that I found dull and uninteresting and it made for a very long 90 minutes."
" ""I swore I was done with killing. She just wasn't done with me.""
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,8,"This Western gets short shrift by it's rating here on IMDb but I thought it was a pretty good one. The theme of course, has been done time and time again, but the principal characters and cinematography help it rise above it's B movie origins. I like the idea of real life fathers and sons portraying characters with the same relationship, so Donald Sutherland and son Kiefer made the story work here, of a long waylaid Civil War soldier returning to his home town only to be rebuffed by a preacher father who detests his son's reputation as a gunfighter.What would have made the story distressing to me is if John Henry Clayton (Kiefer Sutherland) had reunited with his former fiancé, Mary Alice Watson (Demi Moore). That would have made the story more than intentionally clichéd, so I found it appealing that John Henry's ride into the sunset was done as a loner. The most interesting character here for me was Gentleman Dave Turner (Michael Wincott), hired gun of town boss James McCurdy (Brian Cox), who's conversations with John Henry hinted at mutual respect even while foreshadowing a presumed, eventual showdown. If there's ever another 'Gunfight at the O.K. Corral' remake, I think Wincott could make a quintessential Doc Holliday, he had just the right looks and temperament for the infamous gunman.I got a kick out of that scene when John Henry arrived at Mr. Parsons' (Dave Trimble) general store inquiring about the LeMat he had on display for sale. Eventually realizing that Clayton only needed it for the remainder of the day, his offer of a good price on the firearm turned into ""Or you can borrow it"". I thought that was classic."
" Really Good Western
",2017-07-09 00:00:00,7,"I only wish this father/son acting team worked more with each other after Lost Boys, then we would be reviewing this movie as another Sutherland and Son production. Forsaken is a nice rounded western plot with some really good if not great acting by father and son. Demi Moore was a gem to see on screen face to face with her long time friend Kiefer. Brian Cox may seem like the perfect typecast western villain, but that's because he does it great. I enjoyed this movie and it was actually a damn good western. I'm a Young Guns fan and the original Young Gunner showed us he can still be a action cowboy."
" A well done repeat of an old story line.
",2017-06-30 00:00:00,10,"The prodigal son returns, but his initial reception is chilly, by both the father and citizens of the town. Redemption occurs, but mostly for the father. as the redemption part of it will end up not what you expect.The Southerlands do a wonderful job of being father and son, but the best acting award goes to Demi Moore. I was actually amazed at how well she portrayed a rural, southern-ish farmer's wife. I am from the Southern US and find it insulting at times how actors absolutely fail to speak as we do, or as we did. Demi was almost PERFECT. Until this film, I was not a Demi Moore fan, but I will pay more attention to future films she works in after seeing her in this one.This film will not be an epic and will probably fade fast, remaining as something to watch late at night when one has nothing to do and cannot sleep. I, however, urge you to watch Forsaken as it is well worth your time. You will not feel l like you have wasted an hour or so with it, and you will truly feel both anger, and tearful, at times."
" Good Movie; Not Sure About the Western
",2017-05-31 00:00:00,6,"I don't want to rag on Canadian productions. This one was made in Bannff. I live in the Dallas area. North and Central Texas, really more West Texas, are thee west of the original movies. That along with Oklahoma, Montana and so on. I live not far from the Chisholm Trail - in fact it's in a mall parking lot today.The point being that this felt like it was filmed in a movie studio - and frankly one that wasn't that well researched. The set looked like a set. It didn't feel real.The dialog narrowly escapes Canadianisms. And certain subtle things in the film are decidedly not Western US. Some of the furniture on set is not 1872 and there are other errors as well.I think the movie could have been grittier. The town wasn't as large as in classic Reconstruction era towns. Plano and Allen Texas were just such towns and post-civil war they were much more substantive and I know this because of photos from that era.People seem to stand around instead of going about relatively normal business. Most westerns have more people in town - which is pretty accurate. The towns themselves are usually not huge but the farmers would come into town to trade.Sutherland and Sutherland did a great acting job with an average script. You see men in worn civil war uniforms at the beginning and by 1872 that wasn't very realistic. The characters in some cases (the Demi Moore character) seemed rather flat as opposed to rounded.The firearms were fairly accurate though by this era Gatling guns were pretty easy to come by. The people were probably a bit too well fed looking. The 1930's and 1940's era Western films were more accurate in that the people often looked worn and haggard. The women were a bit too pretty and the men a bit too handsome. Also the beards and hair weren't oily enough and the beards were trimmed a bit too neatly. The town would have been covered in sand and dirt - the buildings were too neat and too new looking - even in anticipation of the railroad coming through.These guys were not John Huston, Sam Peckinpah or Raol Walsh. The shots didn't create the lushness of Huston's later films. It was a bit too photo-realistic. I would have used filters of various kinds. And I would have aimed for Panavision or modified Cinemascope as these would have created a more lush feeling for the viewer. Many of the larger studios still have this stuff stored in mothballs - I'm shocked they didn't try to access that.Missing especially were expansive and bold shots, and dramatic pauses and cutaway techniques that made for classic Western. Take a look at 1930's, 1940's and 1950's era Westerns and even such of the cheesy Italian spaghetti Westerns - even they were much, much better than this film.This is a 21st century feel good adaptation of a classic Western. It needed to be shot in the Western US not Canada. The look and feel of Canada is great for some kinds of movies. But though some very good Westerns were made in Canada in their day - the stories weren't based on themes from Canada."
" A Western with no real story.
",2017-03-25 00:00:00,4,I have read one review which talks about why this did not have a good review and he talked about the cinematography. Please understand that Cinematography is a useless word and deals with how it looks at a cinema. The acting is mediocre as I would expect from the Sutherland's. The supporting actors are so bad and the script is so bad that I would rather watch a 1930's western. I woefully watched the entire movie and even the ending is stupid. How it got such a high rating is unimaginable. I give this a 4. Apparently Hollywood knows nothing about the Bible and nothing about the Civil War. Who ever wrote this movie knows nothing about much and knows little about anything.
" Traditional Treat.
",2017-03-09 00:00:00,7,"Forsaken is directed by Jon Cassar and written by Brad Mirman. It stars Kiefer Sutherland, Donald Sutherland, Brian Cox, Michael Wincott, Aaron Poole and Demi Moore. Music is by Jonathan Goldsmith and cinematography by Rene Ohashi.There's a group of words bandied around for this one such as generic, cliché and formulaic, and most assuredly these can not be argued about. For this is very much an old style traditional Western, the plot featuring a retired gunslinger being pushed into action again - while he tries to reconcile with his estranged father - is a hard core staple of 1950s Westerns. But what is wrong with having a traditional Western in this day and age as long as it's produced with skill and grace? The answer for Western lovers is nothing at all.This is a beautifully mounted picture, fronted by father and son Sutherland's - which adds heartfelt emotion to their scenes together - and boosted by gorgeous cinematography (making it a Blu-ray must), it's a genre piece of worth. Crucially it knows what it wants to be, it has no pretence to be anything other than a traditional Oater for lovers of such. The villains are sneery and scenery chewers - apart from Wincott who is a gentleman dandy type - and the good guy is wonderfully broody and reflective. Pacing is fine, the story has good drama and the finale excites as we hope it should.In summary, nothing new here of course (except maybe Cox's out of place language!), so expectation of such would be foolhardy, but a smashing Western it be. 7/10"
" Great classic western
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,7,"I really enjoyed this. As others have said, it's a classic western in the tradition of Ford, black hats and white hats. I enjoyed watching Kiefer Sutherland change from an embittered guilt-ridden ex-gunfighter to a stand-up guy driven to protect his father and the townsfolk. The relationship between father and son was very well done, the scenery beautiful, and the music the kind that goes with great westerns. Worth watching more than once."
" It's Not Unforgiven
",2017-03-04 00:00:00,7,"Another duster made in the genre that had it's heyday in the 60's. I liked many things about this picture but by far the best was the cast. Kiefer and his father Donald Sutherland were asked to convey real emotion in this picture and they both managed to pull it off. Way to go guys! I am usually not impressed with either actor as they both usually are a tad wooden in their delivery and Kiefer mostly talks in a quiet breathy voice. He was actually enunciating his lines in Forsaken and we could hear him. The rest of the cast did a fine job and the writing was uninspired but believable. The director, Jon Cassar directed a number of Kiefers' 24 episodes and this would be why he was asked to direct this one. I was not drawn to notice the direction by it being overly poor or great so can't say I am disappointed in Cassar's work here. The set was well built and nicely designed but my one complaint with it was how the saloon was overly ornate. The columns were way over the top in design for a frontier town. Not a chance would the money have been spent to create the capitals on those columns in 1800's Western America and this caused me to notice them, thereby taking my focus away from the scene we were supposed to be watching. I spent many years in the film business in Set Dec and Props (in fact is the same location and city that Forsaken was shot) and often disagreed with Decorators or Art Directors on period pictures about the aging or colours of sets. A newly built town or building would not have aged gray looking wood on it. But they would always age it down. This annoys me greatly every time see it. The bar for any western since 1992 has been Clint Eastwoods' ""Unforgiven"" and very few have even come close to that level. This picture is very good for what it is but not up to the level of Unforgiven. I would recommend this one."
" Not Bad, Not Great, but Not Bad
",2017-02-03 00:00:00,6,"I kind of liked this movie. For me, good westerns need clichés and 'Forsaken' is nothing but one big cliché. Let's see, one example of a cliché would be like the western classic, ""Shane', the absolute very best gunfighter there ever was, I mean ever (that would be Kiefer Sutherland as John Henry Clayton) - comes-a-ridin' back into town, and he ain't got no guns. Unlike 'Shane', Clayton doesn't have some whiny kid shadowing him at every turn screeching his name. Next scene - next cliché our gun-less hero jingle-jangles into the nearest saloon to get himself a badly needed whiskey. Like Dean Martin's character in 'Rio Bravo' this is the notorious, 'No Good Guys Aloud Saloon.' Unlike Dino, John Henry just don't know no better. He immediately meets the bad guys who chip in cleaning Kiefer's clock. Meh – did I miss something? Probably, but I enjoyed this typical western story, with some really fine acting and some pretty good directing. Even though the photography was not quite John Wayne's, 'True Grit' quality, it was pretty impressive. Putting these two Sutherlands on film together is a brilliant idea. I actually saw something from Kiefer, I have not seen in previous filmsa human side. Not my favorite western but not bad either."
