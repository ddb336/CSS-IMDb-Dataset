" Best movie since Olympus has fallen!
",2021-03-15 00:00:00,10,I feel the opposite of all the 1/10 reviews...one damn fine movie...oh yes...and good triumphs over evil!
" The least in the 'fallen' franchise.
",2021-03-12 00:00:00,7,"The storyline has a lot of holes in it and the plot is flawed, but still a very enjoyable action movie. You won't be bored. Spoiler: the good guys win in the end."
" Very Forgettable
",2021-03-02 00:00:00,5,"London Has Fallen is the follow up to 2013's Olympus Has Fallen and once again stars Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart and Morgan Freeman. This time around Secret Service Agent, Mike Banning accompanies The President to London to attend a funeral with other world leaders after the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom passed away under mysterious circumstances. While in London things are not as they seem and before he knows it, Mike Banning finds himself in the middle of a terrorist plot to assassinate all the world leaders. Released in 2016, London Has Fallen was meant with middling to negative reception however proved to be quite profitable at the box office.Going into London Has Fallen I wasn't excepting much, I was not the biggest fan of the predecessor, it had its moments but for the most part, just seemed like an average action flick with its fair share of patriotic moments. London Has Fallen is certainly more of the same, however here I found the movie mostly manageable to get through, if very forgettable. The story and its setup are fine for this sort of movie, it does a decent job of creating a point of contention for the characters, on top of getting the audience somewhat invested. This time around Banning is forced to fight Middle Eastern terrorists rather than radicalized villains from Korea which was something Antoine Fuqua made a note to highlight in the first film; as he felt it was a redundant formula to include some evil Middle Eastern organization to be the antagonist for the hero and I tend to agree. It's a trope seen in a lot of war and action films, I understand the turmoil between the two countries is apart of our real world but there's plenty of other countries filmmakers could use to have their almighty American action hero take on and London Has Fallen is no exception. I did not feel the threat in this movie differed from its competition and felt rather stale for the most part. The way this organization carried out its attack is very comical too, without spoiling much I'll just say they were able to infiltrate the police system. It's one of those story decisions I can overlook though as this movie is intended for the audience to turn off their brain and enjoy the mindless action, which I might add is alright. The CGI is a little rough in spots and the fight choreography is nothing standout, although they were some excellent sequencing of shots, one highlight has to be this one take of Gerard Butler moving down a long stretch while fighting some enemies and I thought it was handled pretty well.Speaking of Gerard Butler he is nothing noteworthy in this film again, he's just a brooding, quiet dude who kicks ass, I felt his character really had no arc in this film other than a minor plot point set up at the beginning which gets resolved at the very end. There wasn't really much I expected the writers to do with his character, as he was already pretty bland in the first, similar to the other characters. Butler's costars weren't all too special either, everyone got by with passable acting, nothing really stood out, good or bad.This is a movie I have a hard time deciding a rating on, as I realize it's not a very good film, it doesn't do enough to warrant a low rating. Apart from a very questionable monologue during the climax, London Has Fallen is a very mediocre film in everywhere, it's not something I can recommend nor see myself rewatching despite not hating it while it was on. It's a film that is a tad better than the first, but not by much; I'm glad it didn't have some sort of patriotic reference every five minutes but even then it's still very heavy-handed with its themes here. London Has Fallen is a very average film, that I can't recommend unless you enjoyed the first and wanted to see the continuation of Mike Banning's story. The film makes some slight tweaks that contributed to a better watch experience however that doesn't stop the film from being incredible forgettable and for that reason I am giving London Has Fallen a 5/10"
" An excellent film
",2021-02-24 00:00:00,9,"The plot is good, the fact that the director did not explain how the terrorists prepared the great attack in London makes the film go without a leg, however, otherwise it will arrest you for 1 hour without major difficulties. The actors are great and the audio-visual is even better, I recommend it!"
" Bad
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,1,Really bad movie. They try to hard to be funny. Slow.
" Fallen, this time in London
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,6,"Most people say London Has Fallen is a bad film because it is not good as the first one. This is absolutely not a reason to hate a movie.The plot was pretty similar. Ending was predictable as always. Just typical Hollywood action hero style.While it isn't as good as the original Fallen, which I gave it a 7/10, it still got its tension and action. I wouldn't say this film is the best action film or something, but it is good if you want to enjoy a mindless action film."
" so over the top
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,6,"Part one of this film was so over the top. Luckily they ran out of budget, so less CGI and more solid action. Don't expect anything substantial or deep. Just some good brainless entertainment."
" Fun film. Great action
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,8,"People get easily offended today, the film is completely fine for its genre. In my opinion better than the first film."
" Ridiculous
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,1,"One of the most ridiculous movies i have ever seen, stop making movies that makes us president so powerful and have this one man that can not only protect him but also he is equal to army. Stop this prototype."
" Movie or Video Game?
",2021-01-17 00:00:00,3,In action movies like this I don't need credability but in this most of the scenes looks more of a game for X-box or Playstation and when the big buildings go down all I see is just black smoke from the explosions and from the explosions and fires I witnessed IRL that's just not even remotly plausible.If you can see through that as well as the video game scenes with the air fights it might be an okay action movie although below average so my 3 star grade is a weak one but I do admit I just couldn't watch it to the end for lack of interest.
" A mess
",2021-01-14 00:00:00,1,Don't even bother wasting time watching this . I deeply regret doing so
" Such a waste of time.
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,1,"Nothing interesting in this stupid movie.
Always the same old story and since minute one you know how it will end.
They love so much to play with guns. It's disgusting.
The only good part was to be strong enough to cut the movie before it ended."
" Gosh, another one. But still...
",2021-01-01 00:00:00,5,"Bad story, bad dialogs, bad acting, bad quite everything, but excellent FX production. That's all. No more, no less."
" Great cast, silly shooter game, poor cgi
",2020-12-17 00:00:00,2,"Sometimes a great cast just cannot compensate for too much shooting and stereotypes.Spoiler alert:Will agent Banning be in time to save the president?
Will he survive and hold his fist child in his arms?"
" The worst of the trilogy. This British sequel is boring, with mediocre supporting actors. Even the action isnt thrilling. Better watch the original Olympus has Fallen.
",2020-12-09 00:00:00,4,"Better watch the exciting original ""Olympus has Fallen"" instead of this British humdrum boring sequel.Everything which was good in the original is lousy in this sequel. None of the exciting action which was in the original is to be seen in this sequel. This sequel has lots and lots of mediocre supporting actors, while the original had much better villains. This whole idea of going to Britain was silly, as are the British actors in this sequel, plain silly and boring."
" This movie sucks
",2020-11-28 00:00:00,1,"Most stupid movie ever. During the movie I was hoping that the good guys die.
Can't believe that good actors actually agreed to play in this movie. Must be because of the money."
" It quickly loses itself in its sensationalism
",2020-11-25 00:00:00,3,"London Has Fallen brings on a terrorist attack that is destined to make the viewer entertained with its sensationally exaggerated and implausible nature. However, the main event is followed by a string of actions that quickly turn out to be pretty uninspired and ultimately prove to serve the purpose of merely dragging the story toward its predictable ending, which in turn means that the film's entertainment factor is reduced to a fairly low level.The special effects that are used to depict the destruction of London's landmarks in massive explosions are too obvious to be shocking or exciting, and the same goes for the relatively cartoonish depiction of chases, shootouts and especially the splashing blood whenever the camera focuses on a character getting hit by bullets.The characters generally gave me the impression that I had seen them in dozens of comparable movies and many of them were comically stereotypical, even though the main ones did occasionally show some level of development and so succeeded in not being entirely forgettable. The performances were mediocre all the way and many actors visibly struggled to make their characters appear credible."
" simply and fast
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,8,"+ very good action
+ perfect sounds and little music
simple story"
" YES! Good old fasion action film
",2020-11-15 00:00:00,8,"Good camera work. Decent CGI. Good attention to detail. Like cross fire, never see that in films. First I ever saw a bullet hole behind a guy getting shot with blood spatter on a window.
It is good for what it is. There are too many
Pg-13 movies out there, we need an R-rated one every once and a while."
" Good Follower To Olympus
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,7,Butler is back.This movie is a bit stupid but still delivers a fun experience for the viewer. No answers provided to deep philosophical questions but none are needed here.Simple story that is really an excuse to watch Butler kick some arse and to listen to Freeman say pretty much anything :)Good Times :)
" Unbelievable story line
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,1,"Films have to have some degree of credibility- this doesn't
Turned off after 30 minutes"
" Utter Drivel
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,1,"Seriously- how can anyone rate this better than 1 star? Pathetic CGI, no story, just carnage without any class. Unbelievably bad!"
" AND NOT JUST THE BRIDGE
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,6,"Well-produced entry into action/thriller genre. Standard plot, with Butler in top form (when isn't he?) and all the action you expectFun watch"
" Thrilling and entertaining.
",2020-10-13 00:00:00,6,"More successful than its predecessor, I agree 'London Has Fallen' is better than 'Olympus Has Fallen'. This is a much shorter movie and therefore much faster paced.The original cast is back, and Gerard Butler is in top form. 'London Has Fallen' is a very thorough and polished film, with great attention to detail. The action sequences are stunning. This film is not as brutal, but still quite violent and relentless. Although more politically motivated, politics doesn't get in the way of this great adrenalin pumping action thriller. They don't bore us with unnecessary information. This is a pretty straight forward vengeance movie without being complex or delivering twists. It has one simple mission: get the bad guys, and its taking us along for the ride!'London Has Fallen' is entertaining and thrilling from beginning to end. And I loved the cinematography. Great ending, too."
" Not as bad as people say it is
",2020-10-12 00:00:00,7,"I don't get all the hate for this movie.Is it cheesy? - Yes.
Is it predictable? - Yes.
Is it over the top? - Yes.
Is it fun to watch? - Absolutely yes!This movie is a fun thing to watch, a popcorn action movie. The performances are good IMHO. Don't expect shakespearean dialogs and a deep narrative, but instead a pretty solid action movie. My highlight was the ""one-time"" near the end of the movie."
" Well that was interacting
",2020-09-30 00:00:00,7,Very strange film. Constant action so exciting but way too violent in scenes and is the American president really the most important person in the world? Acting wasn't great Morgan Freeman being the only one to put in a good performance.
" Never mind the quality, feel the action.
",2020-09-17 00:00:00,6,"London Has Fallen is dumb. It's dumb, loud and only barely believable. Poor old Britain is in trouble again and here comes the good old U.S of A to save us all. And best of all, all it takes is just one red blooded American man to pull Britain's irons out of the fire. God bless America.Funny thing though, despite my contempt for much of the film, I watched it all the way through. Not only that, I was moderately entertained! There's a lot of well choreographed action pieces, the pace never really slows for the whole 100 minutes. Gerard Butler has a certain meat-headed appeal as the unstoppable man tank Mike Banning and Aaron Eckhart looks and behaves like a president and is actually relatively believable in the role.So, kick back in a comfy armchair, have some cold beers and snack on standby and don't forget to switch off all your critical thinking. Even better, don't think at all. Just let this film wash over you and try to enjoy the stupid fun of it. Follow these steps and you'll find yourself being moderately entertained too."
" learn to lip read
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,3,"See "" olympus has fallen ""
great story line
music terrible
no good actors"
" Celebrates unnecessary cruelty
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,4,"That's really all. It's a nice action movie. Propagates American exceptionalism to a painful degree but fine that's what I expect from Hollywood. But it doesn't just display and depict strong violence and unnecessary, over the top cruelty, it really celebrates and uplifts it. And that's just wrong. I don't expect a brains out action movie to further good ethics but I require it to not happily promote crimes against humanity like torturous murder of a prisoner of war as a good guys gig."
" Suspend all belief
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,4,"Is this a movie or a video game? You must to suspend all belief in order to accept that such security breaches could occur. The entire Palace Guard compromised and packing uzies? Come on! And don't the scriptwriters know any other expletives except the F-word? And how did the best scene get deleted? (The Italian prime minister and his inamorata come out of the rubble on the rooftop and ask, ""What happened??"") Just kidding on that last one."
" Giving the finger to terrorists
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,6,"This film by a second-film director runs hot and cold. Sometimes you're on the edge of your seat, other times you're throwing popcorn at the screen. The central characters just aren't cast well either. Aaron Eckhart as a gun-slinging president is a bit too much, and why? We had a black president for 7 yrs at that point, why not cast a black guy for the part? And Gerard Butler was great as King Leonidas in ""300"" but is so many kinds of wrong as head of the presidential security detail. Then there's the whole premise as to how ANY organization could plot such a sophisticated takedown of London without being found out makes you wonder how this film ever got the green light and funding. You know why? Because of the platform it gives us to tell the terrorists to bite the big one. There were several moments belonging to Gerard's character and Aaron's that were devoted to telling the terrorists to GTH. And that's the whole point of the film so that's why it was made and why you watch."
" Another city gets blown to kingdom come
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,5,"London Has Fallen is a capable addition to the brainless destruction action movie genre. Pace is fast, effects good, tension relatively high. The plot is more contrived and clearly purely functional compared to its far superior predecessor. Unfortunately there's some unpleasant jingoism leaving a nasty taste in the mouth - which makes me hope this is the last in the Fallen series."
" total crap
",2020-08-12 00:00:00,1,Full of senseless criminal violence from ALL sides to the point of being a violence propaganda movie. Script and dialogues just terrible and totally unrealistic. Actors are OK but that is not enough. Could be a good action movie but unfortunately it isn't.
" Fun action movie, reminding me of old Steven Seagal movies
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,10,"Well,
this is a typical american action movie. More action, less story and america saves the day. Gerard Buttler, like Steven Seagal many times before, plays the role of the american hero who can fight and take a punch.Enjoy it, eat popcorn, drink a coke. It is fun to watch, sound and image are superb and you can watch it on NETFLIX.The current rating 5.9/10 is purely due to 1 star ratings based on dislike to the pro american theme, which everyone can easily check by reading the reviews which only gave 1 star. Also there are complaints about a bad story (what do they expect from an action movie like this? Shakespeare?""), plotholes (did not notice any, but then again i watched the movie for the action) and bad acting (Sure.. Gerard Buttler, bad acting.. a bad excuse for giving a bad rating)."
" OMG it's a an action movie, what do you expect?
",2020-08-09 00:00:00,7,"It's a solid, slightly overly patriotic, American action movie.Not less. Not more.There's no need for a 1/10 review and there's no need to suggest an Oscar.They're all doing a good job, it's far from being boring and with a bit of a tolerance toward some slightly awkward moments you will have a good time with it.It's far better than its predecessor, btw :-)"
" Great Action Indeed!!
",2020-07-24 00:00:00,8,"Gerald's Butler's action performance is top-notch. The action scenes, helicopter, London landscape, gun battle, date, guts are fantastic.Being a secret service agent how far and lengthy he can go to protect the world's supreme leader, The President.I love to see more sequels from this franchise even after ""Angel has fallen"".Gerald, I am waiting for your next movie. Just kill it.."
" Worth to watch, Underrated movie.
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,6,"The story was really exciting. Vfx was also great. The bombing attacks seemed so real. But the Vfx team didn't give their best when the terrorists were attacked on President's helicopter. Also the character of President was coward and weak. Mike Banning was continuesly underestimated the President. Except these all, it was a very good movie. Worth to watch. It's a very underrated movie."
" Good
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,8,"Once again Gerard Butler done a great job Action pack movie ,entertain you ..you just go and watch this movie"
" So many continuity blunders
",2020-07-05 00:00:00,4,"As someone who has lived in London for a very long time I always like to watch movies set there so I can look out for recognisable sights.
However I always feel aggrieved when things are out of order. In the car chase after the massacre. The president's car is supposed to be making a hasty exit to Somerset House, a 3 minute drive with all the roads closed However, they end up passing the Bank of England which is in the opposite direction.
Upon reaching Somerset House they jump in the helicopter to head to Stansted airport. After being in the air for several minutes they are still over central London, at one point over Charring Cross station. Again in the opposite direction. Surely if you're trying to get the president to safety you would take the quickest or least dangerous route. Not fly over central London where anyone it seems with a rocket launcher has access to the roof's of tall buildings"
" London Bridge is falling down...
",2020-06-29 00:00:00,6,"...and with it all sense of reality!
And I thought the first movie (Olympus Has Fallen) was unrealistic. Well, they topped that!
But if you don't mind that, it was still quite entertaining.
A mix of action, comedy and cheesy lines - Hollywood style.
If you're looking for something real, skip that but if you enjoyed the first movie then you'll probably enjoy this one too.
It's over the top but it's still kinda fun (with beer and popcorn of course... lol)."
" Really good follow up
",2020-06-11 00:00:00,8,I thought this was a really good follow up to the first. Bringing it to London was a great idea as was the story. Instead of being just in the White House this was trying to get from one point to another which gave it more dimension. Brilliant from Butler again.
" Interesting nice action movie
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,10,It very interesting movie from beginning till the end
" Amazing movie!
",2020-05-26 00:00:00,9,"I've seen all three movies one of the best I've seen so far and I've seen a lot of movies. Really recommend watching it but consider watching 'Olympus has fallen' First before this one. It makes it more logical. Acting is great, some special effects are a little too much but it could be all realistic so they did great work!"
" Thrills, spills and Gerard Butler, what's not to like.
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,10,"There is no doubt this is the Gerard Butler Show....it must have been a peach of a role for him to be cast in, but he does it justice. He epitomises the appearance/stamp of the handsome, rugged hero figure....with a heart.
Aaron Eckhart is rather fine too.
The story is a bit frightening and thankfully unbelieveable.
Stunts are brilliant, plenty of tension, a bit of love interest...lots to keep you on the edge of your seat. Loved it."
" This isn't Citizen Kane, but a great action movie.
",2020-05-17 00:00:00,8,"I watch movies to be entertained for two hours. I could also watch artsy movies if they have some sort of redeeming entertainment value.What this movie has are some amazing action sequences. The car chase on the London Streets is great, the chopper sequence is great, the subway sequence is great.But, there there are two action sequences that truly stand out as one of the best action sequences of the decade.The first one is the MI6 safe-house shootout.The second one starts when Gerard Butler tells the SAS team leader that he's going into the building solo. Once he puts the night vision goggle and the soundtrack kicks in, the action sequence goes to a higher level.The only thing I didn't like about this movie is that the first 30 minutes are kind of slow. But once the action starts, it is epic.Great movie to watch if you like quality action that is also easy on the brain."
" Just... horrible
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,1,"This movie is so lame, so badly scripted, so unrealistic it's basically unwatchable. It's more stupid than any video game. It makes no sense. On behalf of the human race, delete this movie from existance."
" Absent plot, stereotypical, predictable and down right dumb
",2020-04-25 00:00:00,3,"To begin with, at the start of the movie the various world leaders are depicted in a stereotypical manner, and their protection is idiotic. Why wouldn't mi6 be already present protecting the leaders and show up towards the end? The plot is predictable as well such as when they are about to kill the president, when at the end banning comes at the last second and shoots the terrorist. One of the plenty cliches we have seen in countless mediocre action films. As for the plot, it's downright dumb, fast paced without any development to the story nor the characters. The only redeeming aspect of this film is its action sequences which are entertaining at certain times but not throughout the film contrasting the first movie, which was a solid action movie.
Overall, London has fallen is filled with cliches and is driven by an underdeveloped and predictable plot. It checks off all the factors of a mediocre action movie, but it makes them worse."
" A Ludicrous and Overblown Sequel
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,5,"Maybe I need to watch this again. I just didn't like it like I wanted to.
It was completely brainless and stupid, and never stopped being derivative of other movies. There was lots of okay CGI and huge, almost too big action scenes. This sounds like something I'd love but it wasn't.This was the first of the Has Fallen films I'd seen. I saw Olympus Has Fallen much later, and really enjoyed it. I don't want to hate on this a ton, as there were some good things. It had potential, and the action was good.I guess London was way too big of a setting. London is attacked and is evacuated, and becomes a war zone. This movie asks the audience to suspend an unhealthy amount of belief. It asks us to believe that the military is this stupid, it asks us to believe that the government and military could be so easily infiltrated, and that everyone is a bad guy.Also, Butler and Eckhart aren't as charismatic as they were in the first one. I forgot Freeman was in this, but I attribute that to me being young, as I refuse to believe that he can deliver a forgettable performance. Some of the dialogue is not amazing, and it's occasionally delivered poorly.The action scenes are huge and preposterous, and the movie's saving grace. The initial attack is very long and there are lots of CGI explosions and CGI buildings getting destroyed. The shootout on the steps is a little repetitive and the movie suffers from the ""protagonist is shot at repeatedly and unscathed while hitting attackers with every shot"" syndrome. The car/motorcycle chase is full of CGI but still pretty fun. The apartment attack was cool, with Butler killing several dudes and stabbing a guy in the eye. There are lots of other scenes, including a really well-done long-take street shootout. The final battle in the building is pretty cool. I think Fuqua's absence hurt the movie, but it was still entertaining.Overall it's a middling action movie for me, and I wanted to enjoy more than I did. There are lots of dumb script moments and cliches, but I guess if you're ok with that than go ahead."
" Fast moving, holds attention
",2020-04-20 00:00:00,7,"And compared to the puffy faced Butler waiting for you in the third and final ""dead air"" installment of the trilogy, it is practically Oscar material."
" NOT ONLY MUSLIMS CAN BE TERRORIST.
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,7,"I am watching World is exposing ONLY Muslim as terrorist, Its not good sign. They must expose random . Rates 7/10 as movie but I am disappointed to watch they are continuously after Muslims only .."
" Complete and utter codswallop.
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,1,"Literally one of the worst films I've had the misfortune to watch. Completely predictable, relentlessly cheesy and full of atrocious dialogue and dodgy CGI. An hour and a half of my life I'll never get back. What a total dud of a movie. Pah!"
" Good bit of throwaway entertainment
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,8,"Decent enough action movie, until he started telling the SAS man what to do which would never happen. Oh and not a proper union jack on the front, just saying. Have a word Gerard, your British after all !"
" Insulting
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,1,"This film is an insult to British military, even if the US president WAS in trouble on British soil there is absolutely NO bloody way Americans would be in charge"
" FUUUNNNN
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,8,"Took much funn guys !!!!
That's it, just enjoy it!!!"
" It's only a movie..only a movie!
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,7,Great action! Lots of fun. If you like explosions and Gerard Butler this is for you. If it isn't why the hell are you even watching it?
" A little bit of unreal but kinda fun
",2020-03-24 00:00:00,7,"Haha... It is kinda of entertaining if you like good dose of action. It is really thin line between proclaiming this movie a cliche or a classic, but I would not call it neither one. As movie starts and we are watching Secret Service agent protecting President of United States it goes really smooth, but when action actually start, well, we came to tricky part. It is absolutely unreal, with accent on absolutely. Title is real - London has literary fallen and become battle field for a day. All that action is actually fun and entertaining if you are in mood for big dose of adrenalin and you just want to forget real world for a minute.To conclude, as all action movies we should not be to hard on this one too. Action is action there to drive us fast and ludicrous."
" Don't stage crap like this in my City. London!!!!
",2020-03-12 00:00:00,1,It might be easier to accept terrorist plots in the US but not here in London. Our city is secure. Our country is safe. Can't even accept it in a movie. Sorry it's a no no for me.
" Stupid plot
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,1,"All leaders of the world dies, but only US and UK leader survives, with the japan prime minister dies in a traffic jam? The japan is too poor for a helicopter???How long has the terrorists need to wait to kill the US president? Which terrorist would let their enemy to say their last word to the world and propagate imperialism before death.Why the bodyguard could never be killed. He and the president still survives even they fell from at least four floors. They can still walk???Classic trash film to promote American imperialism."
" Ignore the bad reviews ( American B+ Movie) My Ratings 9/10
",2020-02-29 00:00:00,9,"Pretty entertaining action flick. Casablanca its not, but that critic score has more to do with being PC than on the film's entertainment value."
" Waste of time
",2020-02-24 00:00:00,4,"Just a waste of time , reminds me of Steven Segal movies ..."
" Team America F^#k Yeah
",2020-02-23 00:00:00,2,"There's no excuse for this, none. Makes Team America look like a documentary."
" Quite good

" Entertaining propoganda
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,6,An entertaining movie clearly aimed at furthering the US war against oil rich countries. London has fallen has nothing to do with London or even Great Britain but rather a transparent attempt at portraying the US as a potential target for whatever country they want their uninformed tax payers to fund an invasion against next.
" Ratings dropped by the minute
",2020-01-10 00:00:00,3,I just had the feeling that this movie wouldn't fulfil my expectations and it proved me right. What a shame Morgan Freeman was in it.
" London Has Fallen
",2020-01-09 00:00:00,3,"London Has Fallen is a bad movie simply because it sets out the entire British establishment as both incompetent and corrupt. I think Butler seems to have forgotten that he is British.The sudden death of the British Prime Minister leads to a state funeral with the world's leaders in attendance.This is all the plan of some middle eastern or is it a Pakistani arms dealing bad guy Aamir Barkawi. His people has infiltrated the police, the ambulance, the Queen's corgis and caused all kinds of mayhem on the day of the funeral. Only then it is discovered that the Prime Minister was poisoned.Once again Secret Service Agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is tasked to keep the American President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart) save.Millennium Films was created by executives who worked for Cannon Films back in the 1980s. This could easily had been part of their output as it is so laced with unsubtle xenophobia.The film has a cast that includes Morgan Freeman, Angela Bassett, Jackie Earle Haley, Robert Forster and Melissa Leo and they are all wasted.There is an inept political sermon that Banning gives to the terrorist at the end of the movie. All I thought was the terrorist could respond back to him with the same speech!"
" Quite possibly the worst film of all time
",2020-01-05 00:00:00,1,"I mean...so much is wrong even with the opening 30 mins of this film, just how on earth did they make this and then make another one...?? The stupidest set of circumstances in cinematic history take place during the London funeral where the initial massacre occurs and it's downhill from there.Shame on them."
" Very funny.
",2020-01-01 00:00:00,10,"We were laughing so hard watching this movie, I highly recommend it. I have an acid reflux and accidentally cut a cheese from laughing. Also won a lot of money from guessing things in the movie."
" Propaganda
",2019-12-31 00:00:00,1,American propaganda at its best. It must be quite insulting for the thinking people. For me it was. Shame!
" Infantile would be.....
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,1,......an insult to infants. I truly hope that these actors only did this for the cash.
" London Belongs To Them
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,7,"Like most films made worldwide nowadays, this US motion picture is arty and well made. Is it likely to be more aesthetically pleasing to an international woke person of fluid or no gender or simply entertaining rhubarb to the uncultured illiterate multitude though? The latter I'd guess, which includes me. The former aren't amused easily, even if someone like Obama would approve of the sentiments shown in here (didn't he take down Bin Liner?) Someone like Bush would!Relentless gung ho plot has state funeral in London with many world leaders attending suddenly beset by lots of bad terrorists (all world leaders have their own lists of ""good"" terrorists) who apparently can leap into violent action at the drop of a state hat. Hundreds of pointless deaths mainly from shootings, stabbings, squashings and explosions later, well, Good Triumphs. For this to work at all you have to stoically believe that after years of planning for such an event the baddies can operate so fast and seamlessly on so vast a scale. The only thing they couldn't plan for of course was solid Gerard Butler. There are other nonsensical bits, such as the London air raid system. What?Reassuringly everything runs true to course with no surprises; I liked it as it's nothing but a fiction fantasy, and decent people can only hope it stays that way. Felt sorry for all the naughty people who like naughty bad language peppering conversations to the extent of it being the conversation - it'll never be on the tv schedules at teatime. Non-enriching entertainment."
" A routine brains-off actioner, slightly more violent than 1st one of 'Fallen' franchise
",2019-12-26 00:00:00,6,"Gerard Butler returns as a one-man killing machine. Like in its predecessor ""Olympus has Fallen"" this flick (tripled in its budget - $105 million) is basically cocktail of mind-numbing hardcore action with familiar *-phobia (this time Islamophobia) as Pakistani arms dealer vows vengeance towards the West for a drone strike that killed his daughter on her wedding. Contrary to the D.C. this time London provides an attractive backdrop to the carnage. As much Morgan Freeman is good in governmental positions (now as the US Vice-president) the whole emergency ops room tactic for solving major global crises just doesn't hold up anymore. ""London Has Fallen"" starts off with 15 minutes worth of set up and exposition and then goes to the drain, asking us to believe terrorists are so capable of shutting down entire London power grids at random and somehow infiltrating every facet of London police. Ultimately, it is entertaining if you are a fan of these mindless action movies which are about action, violence and a hero being tough. What this all boils down to is that ""London Has Fallen"" delivers for less sophisticated viewers and fans of over the top action movies. And that is all.Rating: 5+/6- Just because visually nicely done London carnage in first20- 30 min of the movie"
" Waste of time
",2019-12-25 00:00:00,1,"Never ever saw such a stupid movie in my life. Don't waste your time. The plot is at 5-year kid level, really."
" Typical American movie
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,1,"Typical American Movie, the brown people are the terrorist and white people are the good guys."
" Great movie don't understand all the bad reviews
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,10,I guess a movie about now middle eastern people are terrorists and now London is completely corrupt with terrorists hits a little too home to all the left wing idiots... this movie could become truth if we get the wrong person in office ... great movie that speaks the truth and that's why people can't handle it ! 10/10!!! Watch all three.
" good movie. nice entertainment.
",2019-12-14 00:00:00,9,If you like a good action movie then this is what you are looking for. there is some action in this movie but there should be more in my opinion. many people say that the acting is really bad but I don't find It so bad. I have seen far worse. but the plot is a different story. it is simple easy to understand and you don't get a lot of twist. so you can stay on track with where the story is going.
" perfect time for this movie
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,10,"This movie is just made in perfect time, around 2014 just when various terrorist organizations (Islamic State, Boko Haram...) in our real current world became main topic in the news, and other conflicts like Russia-Ukraine. Meaning topic is current and real. Good action. Liked seeing government, twists, weapons, and people reactions to bad events. Just as good as the next sequel. Hope there will be more sequels. Nice effort in acting, reality, attention. All the places and characters look very real, like real government officials. This is not low quality."
" Impressive, entertaining, but not quite great
",2019-12-03 00:00:00,6,"On the one hand, this isn;t as good as the original, and it leaves a lot to be desired in terms of the characters. On the other hand, the 20 minute attack set piece is nothing short of extraordinary and worth the price of admission alone.I like all of these actors, but man, there isn't an ounce of charm to be found amongst Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, Angela Basset, and Morgan Freeman in this. Someone should have shown the director Die Hard beforehand and reminded him that half the reason we love John Mclane is cause he kills bad guys and saves the day, and the other half is because he's fun and funny and human while doing it. Everyone in this is just dark and cold and angry."
" The most hopeless movie in recent history ...
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,1,"If you need to put your brains in a freezer and watch this movie for 5 minutes, you will still end up frying your rest.The stupidity and the expectations from the audience to just accepte the stupidity is amazing. No logic, no ryme, no reason, only a sequence of blood chilling stupidity."
" Peferct movie !
",2019-11-18 00:00:00,10,"It was so good to see a movie that dares to say what everybody in the world thinks - America -  ! Best country in the world, and who thinks otherwise deservs to die ! Yes ! Everyone not giving this a 10/10 is a communist ! And the politics in the movie were absolutely on spot ! Doing nothing is not an option, and if some innocent die in the process ... so what. We did something ! Killing is good ! I´m looking forward for the sequels, hoping that the next evildoers (perhaps the mexicans or perhaps the black ?) are getting what they deserve ! Fudge yeah !"
" Average
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,6,"The film is as decent to watch but it's very unrealistic. I find it very unrealistic that there would be that many cops that are terrorists. I'm assuming they're not really cops so how have they got there you can't just put a cop outfit on and walk in, it doesn't work like that. Also at the end when they jumped down that thing and were barely hurt, are you joking me it was a massive fall you'd definitely break a leg or something."
" Basically propoganda
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,2,"This movie has many of the makings of a decent action movie. However, there are so many things that make very little sense, and a general tone of ""America knows best"", to a point where it feels like propoganda.
To begin with, only the American team changes up their schedule for safety reasons, which seems like something most nations would do, in a situation like this. Then, there are basically no other people who can stand up to the terrrorists other than one American secret service agent -- it seems like in this situation
1) the Brtish would pull on all of their resources to stop this national embarrassment
2) countries close by whose state leaders are (were) visiting would send planes with their military (such as Germany and France)
Furthermore the reason for the terrorist actions are the murder of innocent civilians by (especially) the US government, which is mentioned but then pretty much glossed over, especially in the ending speech by the vice president
(played by Morgan Freeman).
The action scenes are decent."
" It's not that bad
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,7,"As an action film goes, it's got what you want. A load of shooting, explosives, a plot that's not too difficult to grasp, and none of this romance side storyline.Only negatives is that, right off the bat when London gets attacked. So many various explosions and gun attacks via people in police uniforms and so on I just found it too OTT and unrealistic. Midway through the film, I just got flashbacks to the Purge films as any form of law went out the window. And I'm sorry but not only surviving that final jump, but to be unhurt off it. Behave!A lot of my negatives are based around the plot, but overall it doesn't take a huge amount off the film and the simple enjoyment I got watching it."
" Good action flick with Gerard Butler killing a bunch of terrorists!
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,7,"Good stuff, good action and no PC - jay! \o/
The fact that liberal snowflakes get offended by it adds to the flavor !
7/10"
" Pants
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,1,"Boring intro. Stupid afterwards, gave up as when grenadier guards started shooting people. Ridiculous load of pants."
" Why?!
",2019-11-11 00:00:00,1,"Good actors shocking premise, yes all the big heads of state go to another's funeral if they were good,. But please the fact The United Kingdom had held many occasions with more heads of states!, makes me wonder why this film depicts all the security details 4 every country are inept. They all talk and it would have been arranged. Shocking obviously the producers had to make up the fact White House Down far better then Olympus so had to make some money back."
" Another action movie
",2019-11-08 00:00:00,4,Yes this is another American movie showing how strong they are in defending their president disturbing every plot for rescuing him. I mean the bodyguard is indestructible!You will not be very hype about it because eventually you'll know what will happen even though the cinematography is good
" It's an action film, not citizen cane
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,7,"It is what it is. If you're looking for Oscar worthy material then look elsewhere. This is pure cheesy action. Love to see my home town of London looking beautiful as always 😍. My one and only issue with the film, terrorists may infiltrate The police, the ambulance service, even M16, but the Queens Guard? Come on. Would never happen 😂"
" More of the same
",2019-11-04 00:00:00,5,"This is a series taking the action heroes of the 80s films and dumping them into these high concept ideas for the modern audiences. The film's aren't great, but they don't care and won't apologise. Butler is incredible in the lead and I would watch him kicking butt in the same legacy category as John Rambo. These films are ludicrous and if you hate them for being dumb, you're missing the point. It sadly attempts to retread the ground of the first film, even there's a mole. I think of this as a James Patterson airport action thriller novel. It serves its purpose and you can discard after finishing. Harmless guilty pleasure."
" Complete & Utter Nonsence
",2019-11-03 00:00:00,1,"I know with some films you have to suspend disbelief, but this film really stretched that to the limit. I can't remember the last time I turned a film off part way through, but 30 minutes was all I could take of this rubbish. An insult to British people, our security service & police. Don't waste your time on this."
" Awful in every way.
",2019-11-02 00:00:00,1,"I get these films are supposed to not be taken seriously.... but this is awful. So cheesy, so unbelievable (the queens guards being turned like that!??) I don't know how they keep getting the budget and why (other than money) the actors want to be associated with this series. Such a shame as the concept could be good if it had a believable and not so cheesy script. We get it America is the best in the world right?"
" Worst of the Trilogy
",2019-11-01 00:00:00,6,London Has Fallen is by far the worst of the trilogy and its worse than White House Down which was a lot like Olympus but worse though I did like all of these movies because it's just dumb fun but this one is by far the least entertaining or interesting of the trilogy.
" Wow
",2019-10-27 00:00:00,2,"I just watched this film for the second time. I couldn't remember it then and I have immediately forgotten it now. Literally ended 2 minutes a go and I have no idea what went on.I think there were a lot of explosions and Butler kills some bad guys. I think it may have been terrorists. But then again it could have been any bad guys.I gave it 2 stars because it has Morgan Freeman in it, not sure what his role was but I like his voice.Watch it or not, it's entirely up to you. If you don't watch it you can just put on generic action film 1 or similar."
" If Call Of Duty made films...

",2019-09-15 00:00:00,1,30 mins had passed and I gave up. It gets worst by the minute. I have to wash some dishes it will be more fun than watching this crap. And let me tell you something I Love B action movies.
" I dont know
",2019-09-10 00:00:00,6,"Exactly like Olympus has Fallen, a lot of action but this one had better acting in my opinion."
" Terminator in Human Flesh :D
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,1,"I just wasted 1.5 hours of this brainless nonstop ridiculous action. The guy protecting president was capable of anything but dying. I got so sick in the end and was saying ""just die already"". In the story line they killed a man's daughter right in the middle of her marriage preparations and yet justifying this act by calling it a collateral damage?? what CIA has been doing ? Hypocritically made for tested fools."
" Absolute rubbish
",2019-09-03 00:00:00,1,"Such an unrealistic plot. Belief cannot merely be suspended, it needs to be doused in petrol and burned - except that would probably blow up half of London.The first film was rubbish but I thought they might have got things a bit better this time, but nope.Easily the worst Morgan Freeman film I've seen - I'd expect far better from him."
" The Hypocricy of USA Gov explained
",2019-09-02 00:00:00,1,"Clearly you see that the terrorist was right when he said to the POTUS they were both monsters, but hypocritically the POTUS tells him, he won't justify his insanity for your convenience, calling him insane and denying he is equally insane, dropping drones on innocent people long before ISIS was even formed, selling guns to both sides, encouraging both sides and making unsustainable and conflictive divisions of territory, culture and power, bringing more poverty and oppression, sponsored by USA Gov. and accomplice Americans that never protest or see anything wrong this this arrogant USA foreign policy, but always ready to play victim when attacked, in a minimal compared to the US Military damage done abroad. This is film is just moer of the USA Gov. BS propaganda brainwashing the average AMerican that believe everything their Gov tells them; I'm dissapointed on everyone making this BS movie"
" London Has Fallen

" Shamefully awful

" London Has Fallen
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,4,"In the battle between Olympus Has Fallen and White House Down, both released the same year and both very similar to each other, Olympus came out on top, grossing a lot more than the other, hence a sequel followed three years later. Basically, Pakistani arms dealer Aamir Barkawi (Alon Moni Aboutboul) is the mastermind behind several terrorist attacks, intelligence services track him down and an American drone strike is made on his compound, apparently killing Barkawi and his family. Two years later, UK Prime Minister James Wilson has died, and arrangements are made for the leaders from around the world to attend his funeral in London, England. Secret Service Director Lynne Jacobs (Angela Bassett) assigns agent Mike Banning (Gerard Butler, also producing) to lead security for U.S. President Benjamin Asher (Aaron Eckhart), his close friend, even though Banning's wife Leah (Radha Mitchell) is due to give birth to their child in a few weeks. Air Force One lands at Stansted Airport, and Asher's Presidential State Car arrives at St Paul's Cathedral. A series of coordinated attacks by terrorists disguised as Metropolitan Police, the Queen's Guardsmen, and other first responders erupts, killing five Western leaders, damaging or destroying major landmarks and generating mass panic. Banning is able to rescue Asher and Jacobs and rushes them back to the Marine One, the Presidential helicopter. Terrorists follow the helicopter and escorts and fire Stinger missiles, the two escort are destroyed, while Marine One is forced to crash land in Hyde Park. Banning and Asher suffer only minor wounds, but Jacobs is fatally injured, she tells Banning to stay alive for his unborn child and get back at whoever did this. Banning escorts Asher into the London Underground while the streets of London are emptied, as people take safety in their homes. In Washington, D.C., U.S. Vice President Allan Trumbull (Morgan Freeman) works with the British authorities to track down the President and investigate the attack. Trumbull receives a call from Barkawi, who is still alive, he takes responsibility for the attacks, coordinated by his son Kamran (Waleed Zuaiter), seeking revenge for the drone strike that killed his family. Barkawi purposely had Wilson poisoned to lure the world leaders to London to attack them. Barkawi knows Asher is still alive, and promises that when he is caught, he will broadcast the execution of the President on the Internet. Trumbull orders his intelligence staff locate anybody connected with Karkari, while British authorities have all first responders stand down, to identify anyone left as terrorists to be captured or eliminated. Banning gets a sign to be picked up on satellite for a pick-up, he then leads Asher to a safe house, where Jacquelin ""Jax"" Marshall (Charlotte Riley) briefs them on what their intelligence has learned. Marshall receives a call from Trumbull that confirms they saw Banning's sign and that an extraction team is on the way. A Delta Force team is seen approaching on security monitors but Banning suspects they have arrived far too soon and may be terrorists. Banning fights against the terrorists before he and Asher drive away, but their car is struck before they can reach the U.S. Embassy, which results in Asher's kidnap. Banning is rescued by the real extraction team, a combined Delta Force and SAS squad; they also suspect that there is a mole in the British government. Trumbull's staff identify a building in London owned by one of Barkawi's companies, it is under construction and unoccupied, but is drawing massive amounts of power, it is suspected as Kamran's headquarters. Banning joins the extraction team to infiltrate the building and stop Kamran before he can kill Asher. They arrive seconds before his execution by beheading, Kamran's machete is destroyed and all his men are killed, but he escapes following a grenade explosion. Banning and Asher escape just before the building is destroyed by the Delta Force/SAS squad, killing Kamran and the remaining terrorists. Marshall working with British authorities to restore London's security system discovers that MI5 Intelligence Chief John Lancaster (Patrick Kennedy) aided in Barkawi's attack, she kills him when he reaches for a gun. Meanwhile, Trumbull contacts Barkawi to tell him that his plan failed, and then tells him to look outside as a drone strike approaches the building, Barkawi and his terrorist guards are killed in the blast. Two weeks later, Banning has returned home from London to spend time with Leah and his new-born baby girl Lynne, named after Jacobs. He sits at his computer and contemplates sending a letter of resignation, Banning deletes the letter after seeing Trumbull give an inspiring message on television. Also starring Melissa Leo as Defence Secretary Ruth Macmillan, Robert Forster as General Edward Clegg, Colin Salmon as Chief Sir Kevin Hazard and Jackie Earle Haley as Deputy Chief Mason. Butler does okay as the violent foul-mouthed hero, Eckhart is a good choice as the President and gets to kick ass a bit more than before, and other well-known names in the cast do fine as well. I agree that there nothing new or exciting to be seen here, it has predictable dialogue and silly puns, it also makes you laugh for perhaps the wrong reasons, but you can't help but go with the flow a bit when seeing famous London landmarks blowing up with terrific special effects, and the pace is good, a reasonable action thriller. Okay!"

" I know it doesn't have to be realistic but...
",2019-08-09 00:00:00,2,This takes the biscuit. Terrorists everywhere. On every street corner. I couldn't bring myself to watch the whole film. One of the worst I've ever seen and I say that as someone who had to go see Les Miserables.Absolutely avoid.

",2019-07-29 00:00:00,4,"...still better than Olympus Has Fallen.Yes, there are plenty of eye rolling moments in this movie, but I didn't get eye strain like I did in Olympus.The execution of the plan to kill the world's leaders could have gone wrong in a thousand different ways, but naturally the plan occurred with the precision of a deity creating a universe.If you saw Olympus first, you probably expected the absurdity of the plot. No surprise.I'll leave it to you to guess who lives and who dies in this movie."
" It's only a movie

" Expectations have fallen.
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,1,"Much like it's predecessor, London Has Fallen wanders down the well worn path of empty headed explosion porn. The dialogue is ridiculously simplistic and does not suit a film filled with actors who are actually decent in the rest of their work."

" Critics & Users here can go to **** -- this is a great film!
",2019-06-13 00:00:00,10,"Variety reviewed this film and said:"" ""effortlessly racist"" invoking ""familiar Islamophobia"", a ""terrorsploitation"" fantasy designed to spread fear after the November 2015 Paris attacks, and ""ugly, reactionary fear-mongering."""" --- I say YEAH!!!!!!!!
We need a LOT more 'kicking' Muslims out of every single nook & cranny they've crawled into! The London mayor. Our own House of Representatives has 3 or 4 that need an unceremonious boot out-the-door!
My favorite line: One guy says: ""There could be 100 terrorists in there!"". Gerard Butler, going in alone after them, says: ""Yeah, they should have brought more men!"" YEAH!!!!!!!!!!
This is a pre-Trump film, but it really applies today, as we struggle as a Nation to boot out all the Muslims & other Illegal Alien Invaders while still pandering to bleeding heart & vested-interest Liberal idiots.
If you want a real nice break from all that MSM Fake News, and need more than you are getting from President Trump's Speeches -- then this film is for Y O U!"
" Complete drivel but great fun to watch.
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,6,"The film wasn't too long and there was plenty of action. More henchpersons got liquidated than in a Bond movie. Like a lot of Hollywood films in this genre, there's that slight suspicion that, perhaps,the director intended it to be taken seriously.I watched this during Trump's visit to the UK. Real life really doesn't compare but there's still a bit of time left before he goes home."

" Too Far with Coping Mechanism?
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,7,"An off screen death that subsequently leads to others'. With England's prime minister down a funeral must be held, where all the world leaders will pay heed. Should be no surprise where the plot is going next.With expected action and a small bit of drama the movie is following the same direction of it's prequel. Nevertheless, it evinces a new direction from the cinematography of the franchise for both, the villain's and the hero's perspectives, added to that some building up to reach the culmination.The movie cuts short to the point with less than the expected tension, but it doesn't disappoint after all. A perfect match for an evening full of bullets."

Other than the obvious faults with it that many others have already pointed out, two things sprung to mind. One is that the SAS who are one of the finest special forces in the world are shown as some second rate gung ho force rushing into a hail of bullets. By all accounts everything they do is well planned with a huge amount of stealth. Secondly, Freeman plays the part of VP Trunbull.

" I now have a better understanding of what ""jingoism"" means
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,3,"I went into this movie expecting a fun and heroic action romp through London in the style of Olympos has fallen. Boy was i wrong.
Initially i was still expecting some twist, but as the movie progressed it became clear that the whole thing was being played straight and the Brits were actually portrayed as utterly helpless and incompetent who wouldnt be able to tell their heads from their asses without the USA helping them out. And the rest of the world are just extras whose leaders all die to make the threat to the president more real.
None of the well thought out weaknesses and credible complex plans from the previous movie.
Ironically enough the motivations of the bad guys are fairly well thought out if somewhat simple... this combined with the fact that in reality ""the governments protecting the arms dealers"" would include the USA, the fact that the main guy who suddenly at critical points has better equipment and luck than the scary terrorists, the fact that the same guy commits warcrimes left and right and laughs it off, makes one think that this might have been a sarcastic movie actually criticizing the absolutely unflinching and hypocritical world police nature of the US. (especially with the speech of the vice president gave at the end which was really on the nose)
The off chance that this is true adds two stars. The fun action sequences another two. The acting another two and the suspensefully written plot another 2. The disgusting awful main characters, the more likely explanation of just straight up jingoism, and the insultingly unbelievable plot however subtract enough to make it a 3 which is barely above insulting and still so low that only an actively bad movie can reach it which has somehow bad influences on the real world. This one achieves this with chest beating so disgusting that it makes me, an ardent opponent of terrorism and a supporter of national pride side with the bad guys.
Why oh why sully the memory of the previous movie like this."
" Same old story. Rating goes to gerald
",2019-02-28 00:00:00,7,"Pretty much the same story, like london has fallen. with not much of a difference in the plot.

" Okay
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,6,"I didn't hate the movie like many of the comments I read. I found the idea and execution of the State leaders assassinations pretty interesting and well done. I do think the characters follow the archetype for the genre, specially the protagonist being the tough, emotionless guy. I think they missed the chance of giving him a more meaningful arch, involving his wife and his soon-to-be-born-baby. However, the story itself has a good amount of action and enough suspense to be okay. Although I don't share the position of the film (America being the honorable hero of the world), I don't included that on my ratinf, since I focused exclusively on the story, which is okay."
" A hail-mary from the truly desperate.....
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,1,"The makers of the film ""London Has Fallen"" tried to expose the personal details of alleged pirates on a Comcast connection. Instead of filing a regular lawsuit, the company opted for a DMCA subpoena shortcut. This effort failed, with the court noting that it has long been established that these subpoenas are not available in file-sharing cases.In the early 2000s, the RIAA filed lawsuits against tens of thousands of alleged music pirates.The music industry had just defeated Napster, but P2P file-sharing remained a massive problem.Millions of people flocked to alternatives such as KaZaA, Morpheus, Grokster, and eDonkey. Since regular education campaigns failed to curb this trend, the lawsuits were supported to alert the public that piracy is not without consequences.Filing full-blown lawsuits can be an expensive exercise so the RIAA attempted to take a shortcut by applying for so-called DMCA subpoenas.

" Bigger Isn't Always Better
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,6,"15 September 2016. The Olympus Has Fallen (2013) sequel unfortunately becomes the bigger and louder isn't better route. This over the top action thriller actually takes its premise as a disaster movie at the beginning as if more explosions and more big deaths supposedly makes for a better movie. In short, in this case it definitely does not. The implausibility of the entire storyline crosses the line into impossible, unlikely fantasy much more than even the original. Unlike Harrison Ford's Clear and Present Danger (1994), Ben Affleck's Sum of All Fears (2002), over even Bruce Willis's Die Hard (1988), London Has Fallen is more about how much can the blown 'em up, shoot 'em mayhem can be achieved almost like a video game. This by the numbers one action scene after another become more and more a blur of how many ways can the director come up with more of the same but different. All of this makes for a rather boring, repetitive and unbelievable action thriller."

If this was written by adults, they need to be tracked down and made to pay for their crimes.First of all, did the plotters meet at Wembley Stadium to plan the attack? There must have been at last a couple thousand people involved in such an enormous plot. It's simply idiotic to think that this could have been kept completely secret until it was carried out, but compared to the other moronic turns in this film, that's a very minor point.Get into a horrific gun battle, have the hero walk away without, a scratch, have him spit up some pithy catch-phrase they hope will become part of the lexicon of action cinema, rinse, and repeat. It's Diehard on the street and sewers of London. Actually, it never rises out of the sewer.And then it just gets really stupid. How much of a moron do you have to be to get on board this load of hogwash? The villain who just won't die. Um, sorry I've seen that before--about a million, bazillion times.Every step of the way this movie insults the intelligence of Forest Gump, Rain Man, I Am Sam, etc."

Aaron Eckhart and Morgan Freeman gives really good supporting performances once again. However, the cg is still bad but more noticeable due to the bigger scope."

Within minutes, at a funeral, these 3 groups open fire on World Leaders, killing some, wounding others with only the US President being able to get away. Its unlikely that our Scotland Yard have several staff who are ""terrorists"". On the basis of this alone - its not worth watching and a total joke."
" Easy paycheck for Freeman and Salmon, poor for the rest of us.

Most of those casualties came at the hands of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front; MILF.
Yeah, as in the catch phrase from the American Pie films.
Yet, compared to the dialogue used in this film, John and Justin look articulate!It's a worst case scenario popcorn flick; plenty of potholes - the power's off for the lights, but luckily the door entry and CCTV system has another power source - and improbable scenarios; Butlers grenades explode immediately, the bad guys take enough time for composed dialogue before detonation. At least the car chase scenes here - the ones that usually annoy anyone who knows the location they're supposedly driving through - aren't too bad. Having said that; there are no hills around Stansted Airport, but everyone knows that was really Dunsfold Aerodrome, on the other side of London.Course, the Americans also have multiple helicopters right into the heart of the capital and a massive motorcade full of armed Secret Service to sweep them to St Paul's, while the Japanese Prime Minister get stuck in traffic and the Italian Prime Minister is playing around with his mistress! Jingoism is so high here, I'm surprised they don't squeeze in someone playing ""God Save The Queen"" and Butler singing ""My Country Tis Of Thee"".London makes a great setting; plenty of built up streets for flying around and massive fire fights, CCTV to monitor the movement of the bad guys and far enough from any other American reactionary force - including the embassy - that it comes down to Butler doing all the work, in the nick of time.You know Butler will come through it with minimal injury and - despite having no doubt planned this for a couple of years and seemingly having all angles covered - the army of overly tooled up and suicidal bad guys will fail in their attempt to carry out what ever their nefarious end game objective is."

We could have also done without the overly cocky Gerard Butler's Die Hard wannabe character. It worked in the 80's/90's, now its just tiring. These days, one man army themes are relegated to B grade movies. In fact, TV series deal with terrorist plots more competently.

A family of conscienceless arms dealers, to avenge themselves on the US because of a drone bombing (or something like that) on their family headquarters do an incredibly well-planned terrorist hit in London. They take out leaders of several important American allies and are on the hunt for the US Prez who is on the run with his premier bodyguard. A lot of people have panned this and the first film as being over the top and un-believable. Well, lets hope such incidents and situations will ALWAYS be unbelievable (and impossible). The point of this and any other fiction action-adventure film is to be entertainment and only that. So just enjoy and don't analyze too much. The Blu-Ray / DVD / Digital HD is excellent quality. Highly recommended."

London Has Fallen, like Under Siege 2 is a waste of space!I loved Olympus Has Fallen and this being the case I was looking forward to its sequel with anticipation since it was first announced. Also, as a British person, the chance to see an action film set in London was an attraction in itself.How disappointed I was!Now, this is an action film I know but disbelief cannot be suspended far enough. There has clearly been no research carried out on security procedures, state occasions, British chain of command or anything else really. It screams laziness on the part of script writers and producers, one of which was star Gerard Butler who is British.... shame on you for not having the balls to point out glaring cultural errors that verge on racism!Don't get me wrong, my beef isn't just with the usual American ""Jolly hockey sticks"" Downton Abbey view of British people, to be fair all of the Heads of State equally suffer from racist stereotyping. My biggest gripe is that its just not believable.Are we supposed to believe that the terrorists would be able to plan for the Japanese Prime Minister getting stuck in a traffic jam on a bridge? Are we supposed to believe that the terrorists knew the Italian President would decide to have an illicit encounter with his mistress, unguarded, on the roof of Westminster Abbey? Are we supposed to believe that terrorists would be able to not just infiltrate a regiment of Guards, but be able to work it so they were not only in the same regiment, but the same platoon.... every soldier in the platoon was a terrorist I might add... and then, that platoon of terrorists hiding in plain sight in the British Army manage to be on duty in Buckingham Palace on the right day, at the right time to shoot an Angela Merkel clone who stands unguarded with her back to the public standing yards away??!! Oh... and it also seems the entire Metropolitan Police Service are terrorists too! Who came up with this shit?You don't have to be ex military as I am to know that the simplest plan is always the most effective. At the time all this is happening the US President is entering St Pauls Cathedral for the funeral that everybody should be attending instead of galavanting around London. Why didn't the writers use common sense and place all the leaders where they were supposed to be, in the cathedral attending the funeral, and then blow the place up?We're supposed to believe the terrorists orchestrated the death of the Prime Minister to get the world leaders together but then kill them in separate attacks across London instead of the one place they can be certain everyone will be. The blowing up of St Paul Cathedral, a building that survived the blitz when everything around it was flattened, a symbol of British resilience and resistance, would have been spectacular and as heart rending to Brits as the destruction of the White House would be to Americans. But no. The powers that be wanted to destroy or damage as many landmarks as possible so worked the plot around the effects set pieces.That in essence is the problem. Even in a popcorn action flick the plot needs to be the reason for the action, not the action being the reason for a plot.Sadly, this film has tarnished my liking of Olympus Has Fallen, and if there is a sequel? Nope. Sorry. No way!"

Only Gerald Butler can save the Prez.The production is a formula action film. There are no real twists, Aaron Eckhart was very stiff as President if not miscast.

" Lots Of Action But A Really Silly Story
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,4,"Gerard Butler was called back into service as Secret Service agent Mike Banning, in this sequel to the movie ""Olympus Has Fallen."" It's much the same story - Banning has to protect the US president from a bunch of bad guys. In this case it's stereotypical Middle Eastern terrorists who are the villains. To state the positive first - if the only thing you care about in a movie is action, then ""London Has Fallen"" works. Once the terrorist attack (or attacks) start - this doesn't lose steam. It just keeps going and going and going like its on steroids. But personally I like even an action story to be at least semi-coherent; a little bit logical; to have a bit of a believable story. On those points, this one fails big time - and it all fails because of what I can only interpret as American jingoism on the part of the movie makers.The basic story revolves around a trip by the US President (again played by Aaron Echkart, as in ""Olympus ..."") to London at attend the funeral of the British Prime Minister. Banning - who wants to take time off because of the impending birth of his first child - gets drafted to accompany him. What could go wrong on a trip to London anyway? As it turns out - a lot, and here's where it falls apart. The British - MI6, Scotland Yard and pretty much everybody else - come across as dunces. Seriously - they have leaders from all over the world in their city and we're expected to believe that this could happen? There wasn't only a terrorist attack - there were multiple terrorist attacks, killing leaders and taking down iconic landmarks in the city. It was 9/11 times 10. And then we were supposed to believe that somehow the terrorists had so completely infiltrated the British police that there wasn't only a mole near the top - even many if not most of the officers on the ground were a part of this attack. And then we're expected to believe that on British soil the British military is going to start looking helplessly to Mike Banning for instructions on what to do and how to handle this. Seriously? I mean - seriously?On the seriousness scale, this movie falls completely apart. Lots of good action - and lots of excitement - but I just couldn't buy into most of what I saw happening on screen.

" An improvement
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,7,"Begging to differ with 'Olympus Has Fallen' (2013) being a better choice than 'London Has Fallen' (2016). 'OHF' actually made no lasting impression ('White House Down', also 2013, was more entertaining), to the extent that I failed to acknowledge the connection; had I remembered, I might not have bothered to see 'LHF.'
The considerable lack of verisimilitude in the heroics of either one is a given. But while production values in the earlier one indeed were considerably better, narrative, the motivation of the terrorists and the havoc involved in 'London as Fallen' are much - much - less unreasonable. Peace."
" IQ has fallen
",2018-02-13 00:00:00,1,"Sometimes what looks like a half-decent movie judging from actors, press material and so on, turns out to be just SHOCKINGLY bad. Add this to the list. What utterly provokes me to write this review is not so much the completely bland and predictable storytelling that looks like it could have been done by a 12-year-old. Neither is it the characters being as flat as pancakes, with every attempt to humanize them ending up being ridiculous (for instance some failed bro-mancy moments between the president and his guardian). It is not even the obvious stealing from other movies (there is for instance a line straight out of ""The Matrix""), the bad CGI, or the bad acting (then again, what could they do with this s*** script?) - no, it is the blatant propaganda and racism at the core of the movie's mindset that both saddens and infuriates me. Had the main characters been North-Koreans fighting against the US, everybody would just laugh their asses off, because of how one-sided and stereotypical it is: Arabs are evil, Americans are civilized, end of story. Lena Riefenstahl would have been proud. Come on, is this view on the world productive in any way?"
" Laughably Predictable
",2018-01-21 00:00:00,3,"The British Prime Minister has died and leaders from around the world have come to London to pay their respects. So too have terrorists.TWO things you'll LIKE about ""London Has Fallen"": The action is fun and loud. There's lots of bullets and explosions and stuff. Turn up your surround sound and watch the windows vibrate. 2) Not once do you hear the omnipresent magical words usually said by terrorists before they kill the good guys.TWO things you'll DISLIKE: 1) The CGI. It's not very good. Nowadays CGI explosions look good and realistic, and it's an inexpensive (and safer) alternative to the real thing. The CHI here looks like cheap CGI. I've seen better in homemade YouTube videos. 2) The script. This movie and its lead actor are better when there's no dialogue."
" i hate the story line.
",2018-01-14 00:00:00,1,I was expect some hollywood movie with bad ending. like the president will killed. just like The man in the high castle series.
" A pile of the unmentionable.
",2017-12-30 00:00:00,2,"I'll be honest I saw a twenty second trailer and thought this was worth a look, it starts off not too bad, then totally loses the plot, indeed there is no plot. Terrorists annihilate London to hunt down a Saintly American president, oh the irony. There are believe it or not positives, the special effects are impressive, and the scenes of an empty London look particularly eerie. The trouble is so much money went into this film it's almost heartbreaking, when you think of all the other uses for that money. A waste of resources, actors, poor Angela Bassett, if you can get to the end you'll have done well. It makes Sharknado look plausible."
" Even Joseph Goebbels would have found this piece distastefull

" Late to the game, but NOT disappointed
",2017-11-28 00:00:00,8,"I literally created my account JUST to review this movie. I noticed there were quite a few negative reviews of this movie-saying that it's over the top, unrealistic, and down right bad. While I agree that many of the scenes feel unrealistic, I can say with certainty that I watch movies for that reason! If I wanted reality, I would watch a documentary or reality TV.The entire plot is one that I've never seen before. After the Prime Minister of England passes, all the world leaders gather to honor him and attend his funeral. While there, it becomes apparent that a terrorist organization has other plans. I was taken back when I realized just HOW they went about unfolding their plans. At one point I felt as though every person in the town was a terrorist! They were coming out of every nook and cranny of that place! Definitely kept me on the edge of my seatThe acting is nowhere near Oscar worthy, but it's not the worst I've ever seen. There were some cheesy one liners that I could have done without, and I get annoyed when movies make the president seem weak and afraid (I like to view my president as powerful and strong), but even with those few flaws, it still delivered.Overall, while there were ""action-movie-cliches"" and stereotypes, I went into the experience with those expectations. Name me one movie in 2017 that isn't like that. In a world of remakes and re-releases, I wonder why anyone is disappointed in a movie like this. I would definitely re-watch, and recommend to family and friends!"
" I've Fallen and I Don't Want to Get Up!
",2017-11-24 00:00:00,1,"More like, ""Script Standards Have Fallen"". Was this an exercise in how much money will it take for these great actors to sell themselves out? This movie had to have been written for The Simpsons' McBain. Not even a good popcorn movie. Fortunately, most Londoners who survived The Bliz have passed away so they didn't have to suffer again by having to watch this movie."
" Recommend. Grossed $205,000,000,on a $60,000,000 budget and Angel is Fallen coming in 2018.6
",2017-11-15 00:00:00,8,"Obviously this film is good in Producers, Directors, Writers and Actors. First came ""Olympus Has Fallen"" grossed $170 million on a $70 million budget, not bad. Next this film ""London has Fallen""more successful than the first. 2018 is expected to bring Angel has Fallen. Where are the action packed Die Hard or Backdraft films, well London Has Fallen is one such film. I have read this is to similar a story, perhaps overdone and I agree it's perhaps true but it works and its why it got an 8 not 10 from me. Sometimes, If its not broken, don't fix it. In 2013 finally again a great movie year but 2016 and 2017, awful only a few good films. Change is definitely needed not in the actors but in writing, producing and directing. I'd like to see more directing in this style and in line with Ron Howard, Ben Affleck and Michael Bay."
" Drivel, drivel and more drivel
",2017-11-10 00:00:00,1,"Is this the worst movie ever made? How can the studio release such an awful movie. Boring, predictable, insulting, and typical US garbage. When will they make a decent movie. Thank God I did not pay to see this. Terrible story, lousy script, some of the worst dialogue known, and wooden acting. I have seen some howlers and movies that make fun of themselves, but this one wants you to take it seriously. The worst!"
" Really It belts us with the Seat
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,10,"Aah really!I firstly thought of this movie as a disaster in London and the survival of those people and much more like San Andreas ....But what! Really !Movie was not just going it was just making me experience about that tight situation!No Time pass in a single scene and full thriller movie that I've seen in 2017...( I'm late to watch it...) And sometimes it really makes me to recall WHITE HOUSE DOWN... I don't know why I love like this movie.. may be they are made for Survival for US/UK president or something other.Full time it made us to get belted on a seat and not in a single scene it allow us to think about it and grab a corn in our mouth. REALLY REALLY BEST THRILLER. And yeah it is not to enjoy... Just feel that situation yaar! It was not for fun only... And the role of Mike! Aah really he worked hard and looking a real agent. the awkwardness of President was real and you can just feel that man! Don't enjoy is only that "" Hey that firing and grenade and that all stuff""..But,What if that can be real?(We know London is always ready for it.. but IT may happen- It can't be avoided"")And in short... It was just Tight movie"
" An awesome sequel to Olympus Has Fallen.
",2017-10-12 00:00:00,8,"Gerard Butler, Morgan Freeman and Aaron Eckartt are back in ""London Has Fallen.""I had gotten to seen this in theaters in March 2016, and loved it. Now the first film I only got to see on DVD which I forgot to mention on my review for the first film.This may contain mild spoilers.The President makes a trip to London to show support and respect to the Russian Prime Minister who mysteriously died. But as soon as they arrive Mike and the President are thrown into action once again as all hell breaks loose. Together they run through the streets of London to stay one step ahead of the terrorists.Director Baback Najafi did a great job taking over the franchise I think this is his first feature, anyway I congratulate him for making good film.Gerard Butler is great in his return portraying Mike Banning, this time his character is having a baby girl. In this one, his character has funnier one liners and even more kick ass action scenes.Morgan Freeman is great in his return to playing Vice President Trumble. I made a mistake his character in the first film was Speaker of the house, in my review for the first film I called him Vice President. Anyway Morgan is good as always.Aaron Eckartt is good in his return as the President, in this one he at least gets to do a little more. His character gets to shoot a couple of guys which is really cool.The action scenes are even better then the first, the action is bigger and even more exciting. For example theirs car chases, theirs foot chases, and theirs cool shoot outs.Overall, a cool film and a good sequel. One I think is superior to the first, it's just respectfully better.I give it an 8.1/10 it's better then the first and it's more fun. If you enjoyed the first give this a look."
" Worst movie ever made
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,1,"There's nothing much that I can add to the many, many abysmal reviews of this film. I don't think you need to include 'spoiler alerts'... nothing could spoil this piece of crap! As a British citizen, I found the implication that most of the Police and Army could be in cahoots with foreign criminals deeply offensive and insulting - not to mention, utterly ridiculous. There appears to be a third movie 'Angel Has Fallen' due out in 2018. Really?! I would stick pins in my eyes in preference to watching it."
" No saving graces
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,1,"A film so bad, I signed up to IMDb just to warn people off it. If I was to quickly describe this movie I would say it's generic, unconvincing and poorly acted. Even the good actors manage to put in surprisingly bad shows full of cringeworthy moments. Every poor movie cliché is here, from plastic attempts at emotiveness to action sequences so unlikely they make Star Wars look realistic, except New Hope had better special effects.The movie lacks a plot and trys to make up for it with a series of tired 80s action movie staples. It's set in an abstract world where the US seems to be the only source of intelligence or goodwill and where, for some reason, the Whitehouse is better able to coordinate security in London than the British.Right from the word go where the already desperate writers bring out the 'pregnant wife scene' and the 'lead characters chumming it up' scene, you get an inkling that this will be a bad movie. This is confirmed throughout, from the introduction of the generic middle eastern bad guy to the president and his security chief shooting their way without breaking a sweat through a London that is falling apart to the tune of bullets bangs and mind-boggling ineptitude on the part of anyone who doesn't come from the US of A or middle- eastern bad guy land. This latter part got to me as a Brit. Our bad guy seemed to have managed to infiltrate the London Met Police, UK security forces and the Queens Guard to such a degree that they overpowered the few remaining good guys in a straight up gun battle in seconds. Fortunately, Gerard Butler is there to take down more baddies than everyone else in London combined, helped by bullet proof glass that can be broken by a man's head and helicopters that can outmaneuver missiles in a sort of airborne 'Bodyguard' moment that could never really happen. It's a good job he is so brilliant because of middle- eastern baddie man, whos family were killed in another poorly executed character establishment scene, seems to be psychic, everywhere at once and invincible until the expected big climax.The movie almost gains a saving grace, which would have ruined my title, when it almost achieves a little introspective consideration of the effects of the US's use of remote aggression and worldwide policing (A foreign wedding gets blown up by a US bomb in the only bit of the movie to empathise with anyone east of Manhattan). But this is completely let down by the fact that the answer to this problem seems to be more remote world policing, with Morgan Freeman in the White House using Google Maps and a bunch of colleagues who look like they have been slapped with fishes to figure out things that no one in London seems to have noticed. If there is still any shadow left of the film's critical consideration of the US's moral place in the world, it is shattered by the implied conclusion that 'Oh well, we get it wrong sometimes but we have bigger guns so we can sort it out and ... oh look, there's Gerard Buttler hanging out of a car shooting a guy on a motorcycle (Just one of the film's incredibly original stunts you definitely won't have seen a hundred times before).Truly, the only plot in this movie is the ongoing documentary of how not to make a good movie represented in every cheap bang and tacky slow-motion shot that attempts to replace any shadow of artful movie creation with in-your-face rubbish. There's not even an attempt to explain how one unlikely event leads on to another, with seemingly all-knowing bad guys being appearing at a crash landing within seconds, as well as placing bombs for the right people to just stumble across. I knew I wouldn't have to tick the 'contains spoiler' box - It would be impossible to write a spoiler for this movie as you know from the second you turn it on that Gerard will save the day and return home to his loving ... blah, blah, blah. If you want a gripping tale of wanton destruction and ineptitude in Britain with a hint of covert racism on the side, do yourself a favour and check out Brexit. Its main characters at least vaguely believable."
" Actually Enjoyed it
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,7,"Sorry to spoil the party but I actually enjoyed this movie.OK it isn't Shakespeare or some deep meaning movie but it isn't meant to be. OK it has lots of plot holes and is pretty far fetched, as are most thrillers but I didn't watch it for any of those reasons.This a good paced thriller and Mr Butler carries it of well. The action never stops from beginning to end and the acting no where near as bad as others on here have said.I am only glad I didn't pay attention to all the negative comments on here as this is a movie I would watch again."
" Good twist raises this above standard terrorism films
",2017-08-15 00:00:00,7,"""London Has Fallen"" is a terrorism film with a novel plot that raises it above the standard Hollywood fare of the genre. The setting in London, with a plot to take out several world leaders. The complex operation has lots of action with associated pyrotechnics, special effects and stunt routines. Considerable CGI is used to show British landmarks exploding. The cast all are good in this action thriller. Terrorist films were almost unknown before the 1960s. The few that were made mostly were about individual acts of terrorism. The most common of those was a rash of airplane hijackings into the 1970s. But since the rise of global terrorism by organized groups, mostly from the Middle East and Asia, Hollywood began to make movies around the new understanding of terrorists. Since the mid-1990s, a new terrorism movie has come out about every year or two. Still, it's surprising that there haven't been more, especially where terrorist groups have been exposed or hunted down. This has happened with government operations in several countries. Most notable have been the U.S., England and France. The public appeal seems mixed from the films that have been made. It could be that much of the public doesn't want to be reminded of the real horror of terrorism that takes place somewhere around the world nearly every week. One can't imagine why governments wouldn't want films made about their efforts and methods in finding and taking down terrorist forces. It would seem to be a reassurance and calming factor for the public. So, there may be other reasons why Hollywood hasn't explored this genre in more depth and with more films."
" Pure American Propaganda
",2017-08-09 00:00:00,4,"I somehow believe there is a motivation by the USA for the production of this kind of movies. Unbeaten, unfailing, great America... It's pure propaganda. The eastern societies or countries, especially Muslim ones, are always the bad guys with evil plans and the world's biggest arms dealer, America, is always in pursuit of bringing justice to the world by killing those who have bought weapons from them.Anyway, Mike Banning is the one-man army again. England, France, Japan etc. fail but America manages to gain a victory out of others' failures. Mike Banning dodges bullets and rockets but somehow the men on his right, left and behind are always shot by the barrage of machine guns and RPGs. I miss Rambo movies...Besides, Mike Banning tells one of the terrorists something like ""Go back to your country, *UCKHEADISTAN"" implying Pakistan. It's very disrespectful, irresponsible and unacceptable. No one can call a whole country a name like that."

Her Majestys government protects all citizens in our land.What a scare mongering awful film, Morgan Freeman, hold thy head in shame, pays your bill though, your portrayel of Nelson Mandella was great, though. the thunderbirds actors were frankly boring in this film.I am a trained nurse, an x soldier and our country lived through the war blitz in ww2.This film pathetically shows unseen death, my parents fought in ww2 my father at sword beach with our USA cousins.This film shows a president running around in a museum subway acting like a nut.I am glad our Queen is ours. Also how dare you show Westminster cathedral be blown to bits!Princess Diana was buried there and it is a place of worship, show Washington Arlington being desecrated ?This film is crass frightening for young and frankly scares people to come to UK, with the best security services, that I may add USA needs.I am so upset. poor show America, and my best friend lives in Arlington."
" I get very dizzy and a lot of things are missing but I entertain myself
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,5,"1008/5000 This type of movies is for what it is. It is obvious. They will never be great movies, they are basically popcorn. What I see is that above all in moments of action, there are times that I get dizzy. The camera is crazy. It has all the means of the world and does not take advantage of them.Clear is the script, does not exist, does not explain anything or explains it badly and the dialogues are bad, did anyone expect something different?The actors, what are they going to do? The film does not give for more.Photography is not good. These films usually have nice pictures, for the pasta they have, but this is not the case.The management is not good either. With the means he has he should have made some spectacular plans. Plans beautiful, well composed and alone. However he gets dizzy, does not give time to see anything by the amount of planes he rides.The effects on many planes leave much to be desired, that is rare, with the money they drive.But in the end they just want to entertain and I think they have done it"
" Very Entertaining
",2017-07-25 00:00:00,8,"Unlike the majority, I thought this movie was very entertaining. It is not cerebral; it is an action movie. I like the fact that it is politically incorrect (I thought it treated certain religious fanatics with kid gloves). This is an underrated movie for red-blooded Americans."
" A very fun and underrated sequel
",2017-07-18 00:00:00,8,"Plot: In London for the Prime Minister's funeral, Mike Banning discovers a plot to assassinate all the attending world leaders.This is a very fun and underrated sequel that I feel gets too much hate from people, this is not supposed to be Mad Max Fury Road which I felt got too much praise, but this film knew what it was and went for it. Most of the cast do a good job with their characters especially Gerard Butler who is clearing having a ball playing this character and it shows. The story is straight forwarded and to the point unlike other films like Mad Max which was all over the place and never took a break.The action in this film is very well done, allowing us to see what is happening and not resorting to using shaky cam. The fallen films are throwbacks to the 80s and 90s one man action films that we consider classics and I love seeing that since we rarely have that these days.The only negative to this film is the villains are very weak compared the first one, they don't have a presence to them to allow us to be threatened by them.Overall, London Has Fallen is a very fun sequel that knew what it was and went for it, if you're an action fan and you liked the first one and you didn't see this check it out, you won't regret it."
" Cheesy action sequel
",2017-07-17 00:00:00,7,"London Has Fallen is the follow-up to terrorists-in-the-White-House thriller OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN, featuring returning cast members Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart, and Morgan Freeman. This time around the action shifts to London where the world leaders are gathered for the British Prime Minister's funeral. Before you know it, Arab terrorists have attacked and the US President becomes a hunted man.I really enjoyed OLYMPUS as it was a decent slice of cheesy fun and I was hoping for more of the same; with London Has Fallen, I got it. This is a film chock-full of errors, laughable facts, and cheesiness, but like ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES I enjoyed it anyway. The British security forces are shown to be completely useless and of course Butler and Eckhart single-handedly save the day. Expect cheesy CGI explosions and helicopters that look like they belong in an Asylum movie, plus some breakneck action sequences that work very nicely. The stand-out moment is a tracking shot shoot-out in a London street which is splendid stuff and involves the viewers like few others. London Has Fallen is perfect for fans of switch-off-the-brain entertainment and I'm not ashamed to profess my enjoyment of it."
" The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,8,"Action movies didn't really take off until the 1980s, when the technology caught up with the big ideas. Out of those films some big stars emerged, many of which are still hanging in there making movies today. However, in recent years a new crop of action star has emerged, one that is more charismatic and more of an actor than just simply a big guy. One of the most exciting of the pack is the star of London Has Fallen, Gerard Butler. After surviving a kidnapping attempt in the thrilling, Olympus Has Fallen, President Asher (Aaron Eckhart) won't go anywhere without Mike Banning (Butler) by his side. Despite a lot of chatter, the pair travel to London for a world summit, where terrorists plan on doing a lot more than talking. They plan to distract the high police and military presence by attacking the city, thereby leaving President Asher vulnerable to assassination. So if I'm understanding this correctly, blowing up half of London will distract the U.S. Secret Service enough to leave the U.S. President vulnerable? This is why nobody watches action films for the story lines. We watch these movies to see the incredible moves, the gratuitous violence, the unbelievable special effects, and of course that catch phrase we all know is coming. Gerard Butler stars and he just gets better with every film he is in, as his technique and style remind me so much of a young Bruce Willis. Let's just hope that M. Night Shyamalan doesn't make him shave his head and turn him into a zombie as well. Assisted by a cast of veteran award winners the likes of Morgan Freeman, Melissa Leo, and Angela Bassit, this film doesn't just have the moves, but it has the star power to back it up. The story here is absolutely ridiculous, but when it comes to a great action film, who really cares? London Has Fallen has everything you could ever ask for from an action movie and it's star is only continuing to rise."

Shame on you Butler!"
" perfect thriller, enjoyed it
",2017-07-04 00:00:00,9,"I recently enjoyed 'London Has Fallen' is a 2016 American action thriller directed by Babak Najafi. It is the second installment is the 'Has fallen franchise'.This movie is filled with amazing actors who truly make the film. Gerard butler as secret service agent Mike banning gives incredible performance in this film. Banning saves US president Benjamin Asher. Secret service director Lynne Jacobs plays a supporting role. The casting for this movie is truly perfect. As mentioned, during Banning leaving time, his wife keeps faith on Banning as she is due to give birth to their child in a week. The second pathetic moment Lynne dying moment. That dialogue *take revenge against the terrorists and please alive for your newborn baby* really encourage-able. One of the best things of this movie it's so relabel. Pakistani arms dealer and terrorist leader Aamir Barkaw as the mastermind behind several terrorist attacks around the world.Finally i love this movie as i got excitement in every turning point. This is a perfect thriller movie. If you're love to be excited and you're the thriller lover this is undoubtedly the movie for you."

" Gerard Butler is awful.. Am Dram at best
",2017-06-17 00:00:00,1,"Gerard Butler is awful...I say to my kids if he can make it anyone can This is a shockingly bad film. I'm not going to waste much more of my time by picking it apart. There is so much wrong with this film, except the film makers should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves, having so much money and time at their disposal and ending up with such utter garbage. Butler on the other hand is a time bomb where is career as a Hollywood star will implode and we will see him on some second rate cop show on a cable channel. When I think about all the young talented film makers in the world who never get a chance it boils my blood to see such overpaid tripe as this movie. Some films are so bad they are funny i.e The Wicker Man remake with ""da Cage"" but this garbage is not even funny not even tongue in cheek . 1 star don't make another EVER !!!!"
" Embarrassingly awful
",2017-06-07 00:00:00,1,"Possibly the worst film I've ever seen. Your average Jason Statham film seems like a work of genius in comparison to this turkey. Did someone really get paid to come up with this?

" LIfe Seems to Be Increasingly Imitating Art
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,9,"Despite the film's numerous artistic flaws one thing about this movie is becoming increasingly apparent as time passes. The more the United Kingdom becomes infested and overrun by militant Muslims, the more realistic and prescient this movie becomes, just 15 months after its release. It is very telling that most of the sternest criticism of ""London Has Fallen"" comes from people in countries that are gradually capitulating to Islamic extremism. Britain is a perfect example of a nation so shackled by Political Correctness that the majority of its people are afraid to criticize Islam or Muslims because they are afraid to be called ""racist."" Yet they never stop to realize that racism CANNOT (by its very definition) include opposition to a religious belief system that people choose, as opposed to inborn physical, racial traits over which people have no control."

Lots of dead terrorists - what else you need! Plot is really stupid, but who needs real plot if you have nice looking guys, lot of shooting and on the top many vies of London."
" Unreal, Near Above-Average, Over-The-Top, Loudly Expansive Fall
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,6,"""London Has Fallen"" as a sequel does get real loud, expansive and even a little unnecessary; not to mention unreal.The death of UK's Prime Minister has summoned the world leaders at London in mourning, giving a clear opportunity for their revenge seeking enemies. As the terrorists bomb down London assassinating the premieres, POTUS and his personal bodyguard run to survive the caper. Clearly an uncomplicated, straight plot doesn't come as a surprise and one has to only follow its method.Gerald Butler and Aaron Eckhart own their reprisal; whereas, Morgan Freeman is underused and Melissa Leo goes unnoticed. Film's gimmicks are heavy on explosions and VFX, with body counts piling up. Amidst unrequired plot-points and dry humour, the shooting-sequence between militants and the military has a moderately likable ""Call of Duty"" touch to it. Then again, the film's direction cries hoarse the already blaring screenplay; which couldn't really be complained about citing its predecessor.Still, the thrill of over-the-top, destructive action (sans-gore) makes for some good, laid back (plus sadistic) fun, and there's nothing wrong with that. Another plus – it works quite well as a standalone film, too. Therefore, anyone could go for it since #LHF is perhaps at best an easy evening's, near above-average watch away from the usual telly premiers.Nevertheless, it could have all ""fallen"" together a lot better. A stretched (pun intended) - 6.25/10"

",2017-04-18 00:00:00,6,"London Has Fallen takes itself very seriously. But it really shouldn't. It is right-wing and clichéd in a 'Team America: World Police' sort of way. The CGI was rendered on a ZX80. The dialogue will require anti-nausea medication to prevent the average viewer from barfing. Yet, putting the xenophobic message and the lack of substance to one side, it generated a modicum of dumb fun."

Such dedication to duty has never been seen, and these terrorists are some really bad boys! The Prez gets his action on and never wavers in the heat of the intense combat! What would the Donald do in the same situation? Have fun and enjoy!"
" Totally dumb American propaganda
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,1,"Total American crap. America messes with the world, they destabilize countries playing nasty, then they close their doors to refugees yet should take responsibility for those who escape from terror. And they present themselves as the country by excellence. I can't believe they came up with such a movie: they just don't get it. How childish."
" cookie cutter propaganda
",2017-04-03 00:00:00,1,"A 99 minute trope of vapid self-fulfilling prophecy of the type that America has been sucking on for over a half century. Cookie-cutter exceptionalist propaganda with Morgan Freeman thrown in for extra gravitas. Don't forget the hot British spook, Shakespearean death speeches and Ahnoldesque one-liners! But wait, there's more: Gerard Butler speaking 'murkan!"
" A boring, stupid sequel. Don't Recommend
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,4,"Plot Overall: ​After the UK prime minister dies mysteriously, world leaders from around the globe are ambushed in London by terrorists seeking revenge. It's up to Mike Banning(Gerard Butler) to fend of the terrorists and save the president.Directed by Babak NajafiStarring Gerard Butler, Aaron Eckhart and Morgan Freeman# NO SPOILERS!Overall: This movie is stupid and boring. Fans of the original will probably not like it. Newcomers shouldn't be turned off the franchise because 'Olympus has Fallen' is actually really good. It has some good action and may be good to watch while drinking with friends but I can't say you should watch it.# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Good:1. Morgan Freeman does a good job as Speaker Trumbull.2. Aaron Eckhart does alright as President Asher.3. There were some good action scenes and set pieces.Bad:1. Gerard Butler was phoning it in throughout this movie and has the exact same resting facial expression throughout the entire movie. 2. Banning was badass yet also kind of quippy in the original. While he still retains some levels of badassery, he still falls short in both of those areas.3. Angela Basett seriously over-exaggerates her character in this movie and is just stupid.4. Radha Mitchell was poor as his wife and I still have no clue as to why she exists. She serves as some emotional leverage to Banning but it doesn't work and I don't care about his child or whatever.5. The villains were so awful and just overacted and boring. Kang was an interesting, conniving and cunning villain and made a worthy adversary for Banning. The primary antagonist in this movie turns up once or twice throughout and doesn't even get killed by Banning at the end. 6. The story was, while not awful, heavily convoluted and fell for the classic sequel mistake of bigger = better. It is definitely bigger but saying it's better is a bit of a stretch.7. The reason I loved 'Olympus has Fallen' because it was one badass dude against a whole army. Therefore, placing him with various helpers made it feel less of an isolated experience and more of a cliché action fest.8. The cinematography was completely awful and the action scenes were horrifically edited.9. Other than a Gerard Butler's few lone gunmen segments, which are too few and far between, the action in this movie was pretty lacklustre.10. The effects in this movie are so goddamn awful and I am confident it had the exact same special effects budget11. They never actually said the phrase 'London has Fallen' which is sad.4/10"
" Speculative terrorism movie for when the terrorist get organized
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,7,Terrorism since 9/11 has been devastating but primitive. London Has Fallen deals with a scenario where Islamic terrorists are smart and organized. The open and free societies of the West would be sitting ducks.The movie deals less with the organization by the terrorists than with the consequences. Security in a free society always will be inadequate and the movie makes no bones about that. It also impressively shows how both the authorities and the general public would be relatively helpless against smart terrorists.It may be a cliché to have a maverick 'winning' the day or what is left of it when the conventional forces have bitten the dust but there is a truth in that. The hero is a Mitch Rapp/Jack Reacher hybrid and that is resonant. Has the West lost the ability to defend itself.The special effects are adequate but the popcorn aspects of the movie are well done. As is the point about the relative helplessness of the West.
" This was so terrible I stopped watching to write this
",2017-03-15 00:00:00,1,"This is so damn awful that the people who produced and directed it should be shot in to the Sun. Holy crap. It is terrible. I was playing an online game while my wife watched it in the other room. I had a clear view of the television and was watching the action from my desk. I actually stopped my game and came to IMDb to write this review.The script is so terrible, that it is illogical. It is so poorly conceived that the people who wrote it must have lived under a rock for their entire lives. They literally just wrote down what ever came to their minds, wrote it down in the 1st draft and then pitched it to a producer with an IQ of a charcoal briquette.Look I know in movies you need to suspend your reality for an hour or more just so the movie can flow and the director can give you the story in the way they perceive the action happening. BUT HOLY CRAP BATMAN! This is just plain stupid.The story, the action, the acting, the direction and even the special effects are all terrible. Can I give negative stars? no? Damn it!Sharknado is a better movie than this because Sharknado made fun of itself and the genre."
" Utterly offensive...
",2017-03-11 00:00:00,1,"Bah, an utterly offensive movie vs Italy, England, France, Germany and Japan. No other words... I leave you to the other 1-star reviewers... Terrible to see how stupid is depicted the Italian prime minister (btw Berlusconi is not anymore in charge, and now we've a new phenomenon in US, no?...). Curious to see some movie-replies from other countries... CGI is good, the only thing to save. Morgan Freeman... well probably the worst movie to appear in :)"
" Utter Propaganda
",2017-03-05 00:00:00,3,"I watched this film last night because it had received 5 stars on Netflix. Just goes to show that the tastes of Netflix viewers differs greatly from my own. To me, this film seemed like propaganda, a Rambo- esque shoot-em-up designed to make people wave the flag, cheer for the 'all-American' tough guy stereotype, and buy into the current wave of anti-Arab sentiment. I could not suspend my disbelief enough to accept the initial premise. I feel like I wasted two hours of my life watching this movie."
" Too flag waving and gung-ho-macho to be gripping or believable
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,5,"Olympus Has Fallen was a good enjoyable action flick. Gerard Butler is always a joy to watch and it wasn't all action, there was a depth. It came out at a similar time to White House Down, though, so it's impact was a little watered down, although still good. This, the second in the series, promised to be a good sequel, from the trailer, moving the action to a European city (London), rather than one building.Sadly, it definitely fell into the sequel trap. Cashing in on the first, and not really thinking it through. The plot is simple: ""bad guy of 'generic extreme Muslim' type (as opposed to 'generic eastern European/new cold war type') was targeted in a drone strike by the USA, and his family killed, he seeks revenge, so plots to take out all the world leaders."" As you do.The Direction was poor. I note that Olympus has Fallen had Antoine Fuqua at the helm, no wonder it was so much better!! Emotion, tension and grit. If you are looking for that again... watch something else. This tried too hard and missed. Tension was non-existent, bad things happening were telegraphed, and there just wasn't enough background or fact-based-action (believability).So, a ""State Funeral"" is put on for a Prime Minister who died in office (that doesn't actually happen so the whole plot is flimsy) and all the World Leaders attend. Things go wrong... but of course the US security team are the only ones who are any good at their jobs, have done any research or actually stick by their charges. The French President is left on his own in a boat presumably taking in the view, the German Leader looks like she's standing isolated near a crowd, doing the tourist thing watching changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace (!?!) and the Japanese Leader is just stuck in a traffic jam with one driver in the car... But Butler is the best! He has a plan. The US rock! Severe plot holes all the way through. Very little research into how things actually are in London, and the whole film suggests that our security forces are woefully ineffective. Only Banner (Butler) has any idea what is going on and orders around the SAS! Harumph. Too much American flag waving, gung-ho, cheesy macho dialogue for me, and too many improbable scenes, or consequences of actions. I realise the bad guys are meant to be really good at what they are doing but they only had two years... just no. Ridiculous examples of surviving stuff that were just daft, and shoot-em-up scenes that looked for all the world like the CGI in a Tom Clancy video game left me feeling a bit bored and disconnected. I found myself thinking, why isn't there any coverage of the countries that have lost their leaders? Why do we not see the USA on the phone to them? Why is everyone expendable - collateral damage - except the US President? What is everyone else doing whilst all this silliness is going on? Where are the Royal Family? Just too improbable to be entertaining, in my humble opinion. Some good fight scenes - hand to hand - but absolutely no feeling that Banning might actually be in any danger, or that the President was actually going to get hurt. That's not a spoiler, that's a foregone conclusion.Banning knows where an MI5 safehouse is, security breach right there, knows the back streets of London like the back of his hand, yet makes clear mistakes in not being able to hide the president in places that might actually be secure. Oh, and the drone that is always above the President? Bit of a giveaway to his location, no? Why do the Sit Room worry where he is, if there IS a drone above the President? Is that a feasible plot tool given the scenario? Maybe they are used during finite walk-abouts and security details together with snipers on roofs, etc, but after all that has gone on, in London, ALL the time? Really?The first half was good. Interesting enough to be mildly gripping, and flight/helicopter scenes, whilst predictable, were a little tense. The denouement; the ""who to blame"" portion? Wrapped up far to easily and ""Hollywood"" in a neat little bow with, again, shoddy writing that someone wouldn't cover their tracks, or have had an escape plan in place, or even had thought it through a little bit. Silly illogical writing. Despite all this, plot weaknesses and ridiculous dialogue not withstanding, for Saturday night viewing at home it's an okay action film, if you can suspend your incredulity. I can only give it five out of ten because of it's lack of redeeming features; some views of London were lovely, Gerard Butler is easy on the eye, and Angela Bassett and Morgan Freeman brought the acting chops and gave it some minimal range. I would summarise; typical sequel - not anywhere near as good as the first."
" How can so much energetic silliness be so tedious?
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,3,"What more can I add to what has already been said – this is just an awful movie (and my standards are pretty low). There is no real story – just a contrived set up, then a continuous, nonsensical chase/running gun fight with invincible Mike Banning never much threatened by a horde of generic terrorists who appear to have been trained in marksmanship by Imperial Storm Troopers. It never occurs to the über-competent hero to get the President out of his suit and into one of the never ending supply of corpse's uniforms/body armour and simply wait it out somewhere. The 'We've got to get to the embassy' idea (despite the fact that it will be surrounded by further hordes of myopic terrorists) pretty much capped the movies endless silliness. The dialogue is mostly tough-guy posturing, bromantic quips, and pointless repetition of the F-word. The landmark-blasting special effects are pretty good (at least when viewed on a TV, as I did), but the shoot-out/action/chase scenes are overdone and repetitive to a point of just being boring. Sadly, the film is generally a crap-fest (and I was not expecting much)."
" Hmm.
",2017-02-17 00:00:00,5,"If the western government coalition likes to kill and burn a few hundred innocent civilians in order to assassinate one terrorist, you have to expect the affiliates of that terrorist to do the same back. So the acts in this film follow through via the logic of revenge.Though in the real world context, with the kind of tit for tat between two groups of terrorists as we have in this film, who shed first blood? Who started it? A good question.Entertainment wise, this is watchable if you turn your brain off, which is easy to do in this world. Some would say coalition propaganda, some accidental propaganda. I say a string of action packed scenes with little depth. Technically strong, but the slime of pro-government propaganda is hard to ignore here.Just make sure your brain is numb to enjoy. Government war implement this film might be. A psychological weapon wielded by them? Not a great one though!"
" A lesser sequel, but still entertaining
",2017-02-13 00:00:00,6,"Plot; World leaders gather for the funeral of the British Prime Minister and find themselves under attack from a well organized terrorist group.Olympus Has Fallen didn't exactly re-invent the wheel, unabashedly pilfering the Die Hard formula as it did, but it did so better than most. The sequel expands the playing field--or pitch in this case--but more or less sticks close to the original's borrowed blueprints. Tight with little wasted motion, it's not as good as its predecessor (missing as it is the steady hand of the original's Antione Fuqua), but it's still moderately entertaining; particularly if you don't think too hard about the hows and whys of it."
" Brainwash at its top
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,1,"Really, really bad, and taken too seriously not to think that people were not joking about it, which makes it bad, and dangerous for viewers. Seriously.There are some bad guys who organized huuuge terror attack on London just to try to kill POTUS live on the internet, but there is this guy, he's such a patriot, he kills them all.And then, there is another bad guy, somewhere far in the middle east, and they kill him too, with drones.Really, I have seen a lot of good movies, and a pretty few bad ones, but this is the first one that made me think : ""really, you should register on cinema websites, just to make sure people do not watch this...""People, do not watch this. It is a very, very bad try to brainwash your mind on how things are going on in this world.Send them back to Fuckheadistan... really...?"
" A worthy sequel
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,8,Well let me start off by saying if you were expecting a political thriller with light language and house of lords patter then sorry you won't enjoy this. If you were expecting more than an action packed thrill ride you again will not enjoy this. Granted some character dimensions do not get explored such as Jax and others but this can be forgiven with how fast paced the movie is. In this day and age sequels can rise and fall but for me this shone out as one that was on par with its previous title.Action heads and of course Butler fans will really get a kick out of this movie and the one liners.Ekhart (apologies if I have any typos) does brilliant in his role as the President and Butler kicks ass doing what he does best.Don't believe all the negative reviews and what the critics tell you.Solid 8/10 for me.
" Painfully obvious right wing American propaganda...

I went into watching this not knowing anything. Never heard of it, Didn't read any reviews and didn't even know the plot. I literally chose it from the ""action"" section of Netflix and hit play. I was initially intrigued, it had potential but OMG TALK ABOUT Cliché characters! The American white male hero there to save the day against the evil middle eastern arms dealer. And of course every major leader DIES except the American president who literally only had a few days to prepare... Cant believe I made it through, the kicker was one of the last scenes where the Vice President(Freeman) gets on TV and says we shouldn't mind our own business in the world because we owe it to our kids to keep fighting? What we're fighting I'm not sure...just a Very obvious message to continue policing/meddling in other countries and obviously straight out of the republican handbook. I'm relieved to see other people got the same feeling but honestly it was pretty obvious. No wonder I didn't hear about this film when it came out, horrible."
" Utter, insulting garbage
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,1,"The bastard son of 'Olympus has Fallen', this movie ignores all pretence of a plot or character development simply to cash in on its parent's success. Olympus has Fallen was a good romp that was certainly not without its flaws in plot and character - just HOW did the North Koreans get so many assets in place ready to storm the White House...? Why is Gerard Butler's character the ONLY one capable of matching the attackers - dd none of his colleagues have any training or military background??? I digress... Olympus has Fallen was fun. London has Fallen was tedious and insulting to any Brit/European/Japanese, with its awful stereotyping of those few characters that feature. Above all, the representation of British security and military forces as being headless chickens without the guiding light of the all-powerful Americans to lead the way made this a sickening, patronising pile of horse manure. The very basic premise is that the world's Heads of State gather in London to attend the funeral of the British Prime Minister - evidently, the world's Heads of State amounts to those of USA, Germany, Italy, France, Japan and UK... no others. Unbeknownst to all involved, half of the security personnel surrounding the event are Arab terrorists who have somehow infiltrated, unnoticed, the hordes of police and security forces. How the hell did that happen?... Well, you're to be left wondering long after the movie has finished because there is absolutely no back-story to this tripe. Only at the end do we find that the British PM had actually been assassinated, but how is anyone's guess. Clearly, the premise is that there has been a catastrophic failure in UK intelligence and security networks - a bit rich, coming from the country that produced the most monumental cock-up in national security history just 15 years ago! The overriding message communicated by this movie, as you watch it, is that no one is any good at anything - be it fighting, policing, guarding, detecting - other than Gerard Butler ad the good ol' US of A. Arguably the finest Special Forces operatives in the world - the SAS - are presented as bumbling, doubt-ridden, rudderless, clumsy and (unprofessionally) emotional in the presence of the all-conquering, bullet-proof Matt Banning (Butler). Any self-respecting military and ex-military man on either side of the Atlantic would be clenching their teeth and their fists at such effrontery. I certainly was! The effects of various London landmarks being destroyed in explosive fashion are not bad - that's the only saving grace for this movie. The script was written by a twelve year-old and the plot was devised by his four year-old brother. Butler, Freeman and any other self-respecting actor should be ashamed of their role in this crap."
" Lifetime Movie for Men
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,6,"I loved Die Hard. This isn't as good as that. I love Morgan Freeman. He's done better movies than this. And I love adventure novels with characters like Jack Reacher, Harry Bosch, Mitch Rapp and others. Mike Banning is an excellent addition to this group! To that end, London has Fallen is an escapist action movie with a thin plot and some very silly lines. The bad guys are one dimensional. And the good guys are pretty much one dimensional too. Plus, it's impossible that all this stuff would happen. And, oh yes, Mike Banning (Gerard Butler) is the HERO. He's not going to die no matter how many people are there to kill him. There are sequels to be made! (Angel Has Fallen). This is basically a Lifetime Movie for Men. But the acting is better and the plot is a little sturdier. I loved it for what it is. Don't expect an Oscar movie. Just enjoy the ride!"

Those who remember the Fox News claim that the entire city of Birmingham was a police no-go area will find the depiction of London here to be eerily familiar.Londoners might enjoy a good chuckle, though this is much less convincing than 28 Weeks Later. Some of the climactic effects are destined for 'how not to do this' CGI highlight reels of the future.I hope everyone involved felt their time was worth it in light of later 2016 events."

" London 'fell' (and no one really noticed)
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,6,"I remember watching 'Olympus Has Fallen' with absolutely no expectations whatsoever. It was basically 'Die Hard set in the White House' – a brainless (but fun) kill-the-bad-guys type movie where you knew exactly what was going to happen, but enjoyed the ride anyway. I'm guessing that a fair few other people must have also enjoyed it, hence here comes the sequel Here, the same fearless (and borderline indestructible) presidential security guard is in London for a funeral, only for dastardly terrorists to stage a coup involving impersonating – seemingly – the entire Metropolitan police force (no, seriously) and threatening to assassinate the President (if they can find him). Luckily, Gerard Butler is on hand to keep him safe (and hidden, which, even in London, is apparently harder than it sounds!).What we have here is a typical 'action sequel' where it thinks that 'bigger' is generally better. Whereas the first film was tense and confined to the White House (arguably one of the most impenetrable buildings ever – and therefore hard to escape from) this one is set across an entire city. Expect the mandatory shoot-outs and car chases, all of which are designed to outdo its predecessor. However, what it has in increased explosions, it lacks in overall tension and feel.From being quite a good, little action film (reminiscent of action films of old, ala Die Hard and Commando) this one just plays it by the numbers. Despite some reasonable acting talent on offer here, everyone seems to be going through the motions. There's not an awful lot you can say about it. It has bad-guys. They're trying to do bad things. A goodie has to stop them. Expect bloodshed along the way. It isn't bad, it's just not as good as the original and therefore you'll probably forget it the moment the credits rolled. If this is the way that it's heading I can't see anywhere else 'falling' and Gerard Butler's presidential bodyguard may find himself guarding shopping malls before long."

" Who needs an army if you have Mike Banning?!

How on earth one man is capable of taking out hundreds of trained militants, I have no idea! I'm a huge fan of stupidly unrealistic action movies, but something about this just wasn't right. Maybe it was the fact that I was watching my country's landmarks be blown up in completely unrealistic and impossible circumstances. Maybe it was the hideous one-liners from the main cast (which included the lines; ""I'll be back"" and ""Get to the chopper"" although seemingly unintentionally). Maybe, just maybe, it was Gerard Butler's constant switching between bad American accent and confused Scotsman - either way, this film is one to skip.

" American filmmakers made a pro America action flick and it was refreshing!
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,8,There's nothing wrong with loving your country. And apparently IMDb users are OK with that except when America does it. America is supposed to make a film bashing American government and it's people because that's what the anti America folks want to see. That's silly. This movie was fun and exciting. It hearkens back to old school one man wrecking crew take no crap style flick. Yeah it could be cheesy and cliché at times but that's part of what makes it such a fun flick. Let me throw you an example of what type of movie this was: There was a long gun battle in the main battle scene reminiscent of the Call of Duty video games. It was one of the coolest battle scenes I've seen in a while.If you don't hate America you will likely really enjoy this movie. Don't let the haters deter you. Check it out. Happy I did.8 out of 10 stars for entertainment value.
" Suspend your disbelief - it's only a movie

Oh, and yes, it's one sided and terribly patriotic - if you're an American - but remember, it's only a film, and a Hollywood Tinsel Town film at that.Significantly perhaps, as I watched The President face up to the plot against him, I kept wondering... ""what would Donald do in such circumstances?"" Let's hope he's not taking notes.The naysayer membership here at IMDb who gave this film 1/10 are missing the point entirely. Like most of what is spewed out by Hollywood, it's all fiction and fantasy held together by as much implausibility as the producers can get away with, and I think most intelligent audiences will get that.Ah, but ""what about the less intelligent movie goer?"" you might ask. Well, dress it up as much as you like and these people will never get the irony of such a picture. They've also probably made up their minds as to who's side they're on anyway - and no liberal, limp-wristed Hollywood alternative will convince them they're backing the wrong team.So I encourage you to watch ""London Has Fallen"" if you get the chance, and if you can, enjoy your place in the Free World to make up your own mind..."

Was the acting ""Oscar winning?"" Most certainly not. However, if you enjoy a decent action packed film from start to finish, you may just like this one a little bit. Gerard Butler plays his typical bad ass, ex-marine type character that helps to save the President of the United States. There's your plot. Simple and no more to it. That's what this film intended to give you. A simple plotted movie for action packed movie lovers. So, before you decide to toss this one out, go on Netflix on a boring Sunday afternoon and give it a try."

I regret even watching it so bad, I wish it was so easy to just suicide, I would probably do it this movie makes the world so much more cancer then before, I think I have brain cancer now, this movie is so crap, I can't seriously not find any words of how bad this movie was, it seriously gave me cancer in the brain,This movie is the worst ever, the director is a complete retard someone eliminate him and everyone in the movie and make us all a favor! I use to have respect for some actors in this movie but after this movie they are now bottom 1 list"
" not very good
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,3,OK this is my first review and maybe my last only time will tell.OK I agree with all the other reviews in that this movie was a clichéd movie and slightly bias towards the US. Yes the acting was pretty iffy to say the least maybe except ole Morgan and the plot the usual middle eastern terrorist trying to blow up the west.The movie wasn't that bad for chases and explosions and the aerial shots of London were nice but that's about it really. So that's why I gave it 3 star and god knows what the actors were paid for this but good ole Gerard did run his socks off and kill everyone somehow avoiding getting killed himself. Also what really annoyed me was how in heck can 75% of London's finest bobbies and 65% of the queens own palace guard get infiltrated without getting found out er. Don't bother unless you like car chases or have nothing better to do.
" Awful...
",2017-01-05 00:00:00,1,"Saw Olympus has Fallen and thought it was acceptable so gave this a try, And I got exactly what you can expect, It's the standard American SECRET SERVICE IS AMAZING AND SAVING THE DAY AGAIN. EVERYONE ELSE IS USELESS.I had to switch it off because of that consistent attitude throughout the same film. MI5 are obviously obsolete when American Secret Service are involved! And of course... *WARNING, SPOILERS* When they're outside the main building and shooting any British police officer, How are you sure they're bad guys, Could be coming to help, but nah 'MURICA ARE THE BEST,"
" Don't waste your time watching this.
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,1,"All I can say is that it's 90 minutes of my life that I will never get back. If you're after a cliché ridden ham fisted film then please feel free to watch and enjoy.The film itself requires no brain cell at all. The Americans attempt to kill a terrorist in Pakistan via a drone strike and they think their job is now done.Fast forward 2 years and The President of the USA is coming over to London to pay his respects to the recently deceased UK PM along with other major world leaders.Oh quells surprise the terrorist isn't dead.Queue mayhem and pretty daft scenes at the funeral and Gerard Butler pretty much growls his way through the whole 90 minutes. He is a one man army! The SBS and Delta Squad can't seem to beat the terrorists but he can using minimal ammunition and armour. How the hell does one man manage to reek such havoc on the capital city? Houses of Parliament goes, Westminster Abbey goes Marine 1, 2 & 3 shot down terrorists every where. Plus a few other land marks as well.Please don't bother watching this film... walk on by move along nothing to see here."
