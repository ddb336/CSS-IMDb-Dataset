" Excellent Chemistry - A Breath of Fresh Air viewing in 2021!
",2021-03-29 00:00:00,10,"Didn't know what to expect, but the pairing of Grant and Tomei resulted in a GREAT MOVIE! Great lessons to be learned along the way for students and adults alike. Movie was well acted by all and never disappointed in terms of pace and concluded with positive outcomes! Enjoyed it immensely; no unnecessary vulgarity in language or visuals! On a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 12!"
" Ya gotta love Hugh Grant, and Marisa Tomei oh yes you do!
",2021-01-16 00:00:00,10,"What a sweet, cute movie, I loved it! I love anything regarding teaching and the awesome ways teachers can make in a kids life just by teaching. This is a fun and really good movie. Hugh Grant is always so cute with his special comedy that he has in movies. He and Marisa Tomei have such great chemistry, a feel good movie for sure!"
" Nice
",2020-12-18 00:00:00,10,I enjoyed it. It was pleasant and easy to watch. Feel good.
" A Few Cringe Bumps But Smooths Out Nicely in the End
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,8,"This film had just enough strong writing to get it through some of the cringier moments, like a guy sleeping with one of his students before he even sets foot in the classroom and then has to ask if that's going to be a problem. Yeah, dude, it's 2014, it's going to be a problem.Hugh Grant can actually act when he gives himself a chance. It's almost impossible to escape with anything other than an awful performance when you are in the middle of a terrible film, where he has often found himself.Chris Elliot was good as his next-door neighbor and fellow professor, and J.K. Simmons is J.K. Simmons who could actually shine in the awful movies Hugh Grant has mucked up.This movie surprised me in a good way."
" Dull
",2020-10-04 00:00:00,1,"I watched it because there was nothing else on TV to watch at a time. Rewrite won't be rewatched by me at any point - boring, uninventive and dull."
" Neither charming nor witty
",2020-05-23 00:00:00,3,"Hugh Grant, for whom we had such great expectations after his excellent performance in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", seems to be stuck in the same old rut: same facial expressions and same not-so-boyish-anymore charm don't really do the trick. Although the film tries hard, it never really rises above mediocre."
" A Rewrite of Life
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,9,"It is a truly inspiring film that goes with the saying ""Hard Work can make a Rock look like a Peddle "".Hugh Grant has done a wonderful work and his true acting skills are portrayed in his character Keith who is a Oscar Winner Screenwriter but was unemployed at the moment and that leads to finding his true hidden potential."
" Silly but Fun.
",2019-12-29 00:00:00,7,"Funny story of an exasperated novelist trying to be a teacher in a little town. Nothing deep here, but a silly story with a good moral."
" Fun and light but also an insightful look into writing and art
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,7,"As an aspiring screenwriting (and a confessed Hugh Grant fan), I was esger to watch this movie the moment I knew of its existance. I think its biggest stregnth is characters. Being sort of a romantic comedy, I was interesting in figuring how they'd manage plot. As expected, it isn't too dense or complicated, but gives almost every single character (students included) room enough to show themselves so we get to know them enough, and let them grow. It comes as no surprise that every single one feels like a full rounded person, and not a cardboard archetype. Hugh's character has a journey that lets him explore his cynism and grow past it, as well as learning to value and enjoy a new facet in his screenwriting career. Perhaps what I found as a flaw was its third act. I was expecting Grant to have to make his case in the hearing, but they went for a one on one with Mary Wheldon, which wasn't as climactic. Still, I found the film pretty good, entertaining and a nice journey with characters I actually liked as people, with opposing views of the world, which is where most of the conflict in the film comes from."
" A Pre-Me Too Rom-Com
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,5,What could be a charming movie does not hold up in the post-Me Too era.
" Good movie, except for the last few seconds
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,6,"The whole idea of the movie is great, in fact the whole movie deserves an 8 but the way it ends just kills it. It feels like the story is almost incomplete"
" A nice little film
",2019-07-19 00:00:00,7,"I enjoyed this. It wasn't spectacular but it was just... nice. I thought it was going to be Hugh Grant rehashing the plot of Music And Lyrics and although it very much is a Hugh Grant vehicle, it's worth your time if you have an afternoon to kill or if you're watching something with a new partner and don't want anything too distracting...Needs to do more with JK Simmons and Alison Janney, disgracefully underused.If you want something similar that's a bit more engaging, watch Danny Devito in Renaissance Man."
" Adorable Movie
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,7,"This was such an adorable movie. It offered redemption and hope to those who try to accomplish there dreams. Nothing is ever perfect, but we mustn't give up. It's difficult to be optimistic sometimes, but as long as there is life, there is hope. Hugh Grant shined in this movie as a has-been writer, however, he prevailed in the end when he decided not to give up, despite how grim it may appear. Marisa Tomei was a good choice too as the soon-to-be girlfriend. The Hollywood superficial and shallow screen writers must somehow get the hint that not all movies do not have to be overly sexual or full of explosions in order to make a substantial movie. Good job."
" Hugh Grant fans will probably like this film
",2019-06-01 00:00:00,7,"THE REWRITE (2014)I love Indie films and documentaries, so it's been a while since I've seen a rote, slick, clich√©d, formulaic Hollywood comedy with an aging star portraying cringeworthy onscreen sexist behavior, but nevertheless, I was drawn to see The Rewrite because once upon a time I worked doing script rewrites for studios and, (name drop alert), I also worked with Hugh Grant for a while. I admit, I am a fan of Hugh's bumbling, eye-blinking, self-depricating style, and the man who he is. I found Hugh Grant to be much smarter and funnier than his characters in person, with that same, (actually laugh out loud excellent), glint-in-his-eye comedic timing, and a thoughtful, genuine personality. There, I've said it: I adore Hugh Grant.The filmmakers had the Sense and Sensibility to cast Allison Janney as an icy-though-ultimately-somewhat-meltable, feminist, Jane Austin expert, in whose hands the fate of Hugh Grant's character, (has-been, chauvinistic, Oscar-winning writer, Keith Michaels), lies. Marisa Tomei, who had turned down Four Weddings and a Funeral, had a wonderful turn playing the love interest opposite Hugh; I thought the script and Marisa's bright potrayal of the part gave her the opportunity to help carry this film. J.K. Simmons, Chris Elliot, Caroline Aaron, and quite frankly, the whole cast, were smooth, likeable, and fun in their supporting roles.The basic premise: Hollywood screenwriter, (a one hit wonder), in need of work gets a job as a screenwriting professor in a small, dull town in New York. He takes the position reluctantly, arrives as a cad, learns from his students, and has a transformational arc we can see coming from thousands of miles away. As mentioned, this was a predicable picture, but not painfully so; the time rolled by effortlessly. I have a wonderful memory of taking one of my nephews to see one of his shoddier films many moons ago, which was laughably bad, but saved by the fact that we loved Hugh Grant in it. Grant fans will probably like this film.Several years of gut-wrenching public scandals regarding sexually violating male behavior might increase the cringe-inducing parts of this plot, however, it is a comedy and fairly deftly handled, again -- in the hands of these talented actors. If I had to give a number rating between one and ten, I'd give it a 6.5, but I'll round up to a 7 because of the cast."
" This film is seriously boring
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,1,"I rented it based on reviews here and, in my opinion, they are very very VERY wrong.This film is SO boring I tried three times to watch it, having accepted that it would be a silly, mindless Hugh Grant thing.EVEN THEN . . . it was tedious, obvious, predictable, boring.If you're thinking about doing it . . . don't!Not unless it's free. Then, if you don't like it . . . meh."
" under rated
",2019-01-17 00:00:00,9,"An excellent mid life crisis/reinvention of the self film.I recommend it to you for its sly wit. pay attention to the Dialogue. there are some great lines in there. I even wrote down a few to steal them for later! (thanks Writers.)Grants semi deadpan delivery is quite amusing. very reserved brit/ english in its style.
]
and of course, Allison Janney and Marisa Tomei are always worth the view."
" What a weak plot
",2018-09-26 00:00:00,1,"This movie has an absolutely weak plot, until 20 movies before the end I was waiting for anything to happen but just nothing really happens. The plot is without any introductional phase, nor highlights. It may be good for the background entertainment, or watching it with the purpose of falling asleep, because Hugh Grant and Marisa Tomei have played in much better movies, but even these actors cannot help to fill gaps in the plot, very disappointing!"
" Grumpy sexist Hugh Grant finds his passion in teaching. Best suited for a male middle aged audience.
",2018-09-18 00:00:00,7,"Either you like Hugh Grant, or you dont. This actor has been playing the same role forever, with great succes though. I dont know about the female audiences, but guys surely would love to see this sexist loser trying to misuse his teaching job to seduce university student girls. With initially great succes. But things dont turn out so easy as he expected it to be. This is NOT a straight comedy. Be warned. It is a slowburning story about a middle aged man who is trying to find a purpose in life. Although initially he just is wandering around aimlessly. It is more by sheer need of a job, that he decides to give teaching a try. Hugh Grant plays a middle aged loser with so much charm that ""The Rewrite"" really becomes a very sweet and funny coming of age flick. How can an old middle aged guy feature in a coming of age flick? Well, quite simple, Hugh Grant acts like a teenager. Not literally, but in his lack of wanting to take on responsibilities. In all his movies he acts like a care free teenager, who only gets aroused by succes, money and women. Or the other way around. Pretty superficial stuff, but some pretty good subtle jokes come out of this happy go lucky life style of his.It is probably best suited for the (male) middle aged audience.""How to write love"" has got some budding romance, some good grumpy old man jokes and a sweet feel good spirit. Just a lovely Hugh Grant flick."
" Slow at first then quite enjoyable
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,9,I was prepared for a tired premise and few laughs but ended up really enjoying the movie. Hugh Grant's self deprecating charm is still strong and the rest of the cast is quite funny. Hugh Grant has grown as an actor & this is one of his better movies as of late.
" Typical Hugh Grant stuff
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,6,"In a plot custom made for H. Grant, he stars as an award winning script writer who flounders in his career and personal life. Falling from grace after some unsuccessful projects and a divorce, he lands on teaching position in a college among cliche characters: an ex-marine dean, a stern English literature scholar with whom he's at odds, etc. As could be predicted even without seeing the movie, he immediately gets into trouble with a sour turning relationship with one of his students while flirting with Marisa Tomei, a single mom who juggles low paying jobs while dancing and also finding time and money for Grant's course all at the same time. M. Tomei balances Grant's depression and introversion with her radiance and exuberance. This is a typical H. Grant movie with the gravity of a soap bubble. In general, the cast and acting are good with details like classroom scenes being a bit fluffy and slapdash job. Compared to the similar work ""Did you hear about Morgans?"", Rewrite hands down is the improved one because there's no wasted effort for contrived comedy and M. Tomei is a better cast than S. J. Parker in a similar role."
" I liked it.
",2018-04-01 00:00:00,8,"This movie was entertaining. It had several hilarious zingers by Hugh Grant. The story was good and the plot had drama, comedy, and romance rolled into one."
" Surprisingly Good
",2017-10-16 00:00:00,9,"This movie immediately seemed another boring and predictable romantic comedy. Its first 5 to 15 minutes are almost annoyingly predictable, but manage to keep you going on watching, at least if you have any hope on a change of story. But just after that predictable, annoying start, things start to change in a more realistic way, giving the story its own sense of reality that seemed to be a bit wobbly. The movie quickly gets amusing to watch, as the main character (played by Hugh Grant) starts making some remarkable, but also extremely funny and joyful remarks. The movie improves by the minute, and Holly (played by Marisa Tomei) brings out the best of the movie from the first moment she shows up. The combination between both main characters is surprisingly addictive movie-wise, perhaps more-so than some of the best romantic movies of all time. The movie improved by the minute and it actually sends a beautiful message of autonomy, respect, cooperation, resilience, love and care. In the middle of all this comes the remarkable and humorous parts the movie has, taking some weight out of the romance, thus turning it into a romantic comedy. To sum up without trying to be more of a spoiler: First 10 minutes can be quite boring and give you a sense that it is going to be a dull, romantic movie. But after Holly (Marisa Tomei) shows up and Keith Michaels (Hugh Grant) lightens up the mood with his incredible remarks and sense of humour, you will just get addicted on it and enjoy every second of it until the end."
" Surprisingly funny start, but loses steam towards the end
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,7,"The start is very funny and insightful, with interesting portrays and comments on the modern world and Hollywood/American film/TV production. The conflict of the main character, who tells things ""as they are"" (at least as he sees it) and not ""as people like to see them"", and later has to patch up the problems that this creates for him and his career is also interesting and well portrayed.Unfortunately, it loses steam and ends up more-or-less like a ""regular"" romantic comedy, but even then it's not a bad romantic comedy.I'm not a fan of Hugh Grant, but, this is a very good fit for his acting skills. OTOH, I like Marisa Tomei's acting, yet this is not a good fit for her - she excels playing quirky women, which is not what this character is about. Other actors do a decent job. Directing is also decent.The main impression is that this could have been much better, but, it didn't follow through on its initial premise, for whatever reason. Still, it's well worth the watch and much better than most modern movies."
" Smart, thoughtful, and well-acted non-traditional film
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,7,"The Rewrite was surprisingly good. Hugh Grant stars as the stereotypical writer who had a big hit but now has had a long dry run and stands on the outside looking in on the successful side of Hollywood.Grant (as Keith Michaels) is desperate for money, so he accepts a job in upstate New York's sleepy town of Binghampton, working as a teacher for a Screenplay Writing class. He's never taught before, how he picks his class is classically funny, how he teaches is a laugher, and how he interacts with the class is truly funny.Grant meets Marisa Tomei who gets him to look more seriously at his actions. She's an older non-traditional student in his class who is seemingly everywhere on campus. Grant has a silly relationship with a young student which I still cannot fathom why that had to be there, except to show how stupid Grant was.However, Grant's self-deprecating humor, and his willingness to fire torpedoes at all his colleagues, was really funny. Allison Janney plays the head of the department and she too was terrific. She's an impressive actress who plays this stick-in-the-mud department head who likes things the way they are and is in no mood for Grant's silly behavior.Grant is though a pretty good guy who is really a pretty good mentor because no one can teach a course better than someone who has reached his level. Will he eventually realize this? What will happen with him and Tomei, or with this young student. will the truth prevail?For a pretty simple film, there's enough intrigue to keep you involved and wondering how it will turn out, like McFarland, or Hoosiers - will the good guy do the right thing or sell out?I recommend The Rewrite - good solid story, good acting. Enjoy."
" Good material, good concept, bad direction, flat result
",2017-05-21 00:00:00,5,"There were a lot of really good ideas in this movie and practically everyone of them fell flat either from lackluster delivery or just plain mishandling. Hugh Grants character had no focus, he seemed tired and old, and not at all the result of his circumstances. This is the 4th movie the Director and Grant have worked on and each one gets more and more of a phoned in event, and Grant is obviously capable of much more. I can only assume that he was directed to deliver this character, which is just a phone in Hugh Grant really, but Grant is most certainly capable of reinventing himself as he has done on many occasions so far, and this would have been a perfect opportunity to do so again as the narrative of his character is dubious and morally askew at best. He goes from having a relationship with a student at the start to aiming for a relationship with an older student at the end. Both illegal for his position as teacher. What a character development curve. And I didn't mind the politically incorrect nature of it all if they had actually followed through on it better, but they Hollywood rom comm'd it right through from the cheesy music to the slow paced delivery. I could have really played on the Meta nature of evens, reflecting Grant's passing light and the writer's own checkered history of success but it fumbles it all and makes 1/4 the impact it could have. And poor old Hugh Grant, moved like his joints ached and he was 20 years older than he is."
" OK film
",2017-05-17 00:00:00,2,A waste of time think Hugh grant is getting a little old for Rom com s or past it ... watched it because was a fan of Hugh grant like four weddings and about a boy and Bridget Jones diary etc .. but this one don't really work not as bad did you hear about the Morgans that was awful .. but the acting is quite poor .. which turns you off a bit
" Hugh Grant In A Strong Performance
",2017-04-14 00:00:00,8,"Stories about writers who are having difficulty putting pen to paper are a dime a dozen, but I found this one charming. Hugh Grant plays the fallow screenwriter who follows the adage, ""Those who can't...teach."" His life is a total failure on all fronts, but he manages to survive thanks to a droll wit and his refusal to lay down and die.Marisa Tomei plays the object of his distracted attention with her usual aplomb. Without committing to anything, she becomes the rudder to his floundering ship, with insight and a tender recognition for his hidden value. But it is Grant who makes this film something special, imbuing every scene with an honesty that makes the story enjoyable. Here he is not so glib as he is dealing with the trials of every moment.This is a sleeper I must recommend."
" Surprisingly good Hugh Grant vehicle
",2017-03-08 00:00:00,8,"Yes, I liked it. More than I thought I would; much more. I am not the hugest fan of Hugh Grant, but this film played well to both his strengths and weaknesses as an actor and, well, to the background of his life, shall we say. I salute his ability to accept his strengths and weaknesses in accepting the part. The film suggested that, apart from the louche aspects of English writer Keith Michael's life, the part he plays, the chap has a heart and deserves redemption. He just needed the right girl to awaken it and also to awaken his inspiration. He deserved that filip both as character and person. Marisa Tomei was never lovelier than in her girl-next-door role. It is a pity we haven't seen more of her on screen in the meantime. So Hollywood but I love it! There is this dismissive attitude to feel-good movies, as they are called. But I love 'em. Those that succeed,as this does, have this pleasant, positive and life- affirming aura about them. Hollywood's greatest invention, along with the Western. Shakespeare's King Lear is for manic-depressives!In this film, miracles can happen in middle America, that great space in middle of the country that the elites of both sides of the country fly over without caring about it much. But this is the engine of the American economy and the American soul. And writing this review at this time, there are additional political resonances here, are there not?This is a light but philosophical comedy and there is nothing wrong with that, I say. But, to its credit, it does suggest the harsher, harder side of Hollywood. The film didn't have to lay it on the line but I liked that it suggested. at least, the more abrasive quality of reality, particularly the reality of a Hollywood writer who fears he may be past his best. But also, as I said, that the American dream prevails, in the artistic imagination if not always in real life, is an important proposition of the genre. And I say that as someone not American but someone who speaks with Hugh Grant's accent if, enviously, not being quite as good looking as him!Film, or movies, if you prefer, is still the vibrant artistic genre of our time. Modern Western music, architecture, sculpture and painting, seem to be in decline. We needs must take our comfort where we may.Two hours emphatically not wasted.And not to forget Alison Janney, the adversarial mid-West professor, I love her from The West Wing. Pity we haven't seen more of her on- screen in the meantime."
