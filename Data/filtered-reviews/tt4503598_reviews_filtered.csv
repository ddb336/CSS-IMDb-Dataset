" Disturbing concept, dumb execution.
",2021-02-05 00:00:00,3,"Emelie didn't click for me at all. It's an amazing concept, but what follows is so frustrating and infuriating that it makes you want to shake your head. There are some genuinely disturbing moments and I have to applaud Emelie for trying to capture suspense and do something different, but the writing is another story. The characters are dumb, especially the children, and Emelie's actions to psychologically traumatise the children are more head-scratching than they are truly shocking. And it's worsened when her motivations are revealed, making it one of the dumbest plot twists I've seen in a long time. It makes you ask what's the point in all of this and how does this progress the plot?Emelie doesn't just suffer from bad writing... the direction is also a massive disappointment and the tension feels misguided. The bland nature of the cinematography doesn't become clear until towards the end, where we get to see some REALLY bad editing and lighting, and anything about the music and the atmosphere didn't do wonders for me. But any buildup of suspense is completely shattered by a safe finale, which turns Emelie into a forgettable thriller and offers no psychological insights to justify any of the film's creative decisions. This got an 88% rating on Rotten Tomatoes? Really??? I'd understand that if they involved someone like Mike Flanagan, who can turn ANYTHING into gold, and if this material was in the right hands, we'd be up for something truly disturbing, but instead Emelie becomes a sorry excuse of a film. At least Sarah Bolger has an impressive performance that carries the entire film on her back. It's a shame she doesn't get much help from everyone else involved in Emelie.Also, I really hope the child actors were okay during production. Because if they were exposed like the child characters were in this film, then that's not okay.Plot and Characters (2/10)

" A very long 82 minutes
",2021-01-30 00:00:00,3,"Good idea, although predictable. Just lots of weird/creepy behaviour for 50 minutes before anything really happens. Then as most of these types of thrillers, it ends abruptly and you're left thinking that was a waste time. Find something else to watch."
" Bad Babysitter
",2020-09-19 00:00:00,10,"Emelie is a terrific horror movie. Filled with great performances, characters and story. Sarah Bolger is the stand out of course. I highly recommend it.Tim Treakle"
" Cheap shock tactics the movie.
",2020-09-07 00:00:00,1,"Some decent dramatic tension but that's all the film decently. Drags on for too long with unlikable characters. Killing an animal on screen is just lazy, better luck next time bud. Stick to live concert films."
" Masterpiece.
",2020-08-20 00:00:00,9,Really intense and freaky! I loved it. I wish the ending was a little better tho
" How not to write a thriller/mystery film
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,1,"The acting is okay but the plot is convoluted, leaving you with many unanswered questions. It just does not deliver and leaves you feeling completely cheated. The only thought that will preoccupy your mind by the film's end will be: 'Why did I end up being led into watching a film with a promising premise that ends up doing the equivalent of spitting in the faces of it's audience by leaving so many plot holes that it makes swiss cheese look fairly wholesome looking by comparison?"""
" Interesting start and boring ending
",2020-07-29 00:00:00,6,"A well-filmed psychological thriller with horror elements interests the first two-thirds of the timing, and then slides into something standard and seen many, many times. Of the actors, only Sarah Bolger is worth noting. Children play rather themselves and are not particularly remembered. In general, a strong middle peasant. View and put on the shelf."
" Teen scream minus five
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,3,Psycho crazy-eyed teenie bopper girl babysits and terrorizes 3 young kids under her watch. Blah blah. The storyline is dull and never bothers to explain what made her a psychopath. Good acting by the naturally bright eyed children though. Kudos to casting for that. But the plot is silly and boring and meant only to scare a kiddie audience. And perhaps an overblown commercial for parents to install hidden cameras in the home. Nail them evil babysitters from the comfort of your smart phone
" Waste of time
",2020-06-06 00:00:00,4,"This movie is complete garbage. No build up to the characters. Such a plain boring plot. Unrealistic not to mention . There's 1,000 bad things I can say about it but to sum it all up , simply DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ."
" Rotten
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,1,You just know when you have watched an utter pile of crap why even make movies like these all over the place zero stars
" Dont waste your time watching like i did. Too many holes in the story
",2020-05-25 00:00:00,1,"The usual baby sitter Maggie can't watch the kids. She tells the parents her friend Anna can.
UM, What parent doesn't meet the girl 1st or at least have Maggie send a pic of what she looks like?
also. how did Emelie the psycho know Anna was taking Maggie's place as babysitter. How did Emelie and her very older bf know what Anna looked like to grab her so Emelie could replace her.
also. why did she stay in the house so long. Makes no sense at all.
and the car in the car -Anna just stands there and doesn't jump out of the way of the car.
Did Anyone else want Emelie to bleed out? Yes, i know how that sounds. but i am a mom. Touch my kid, you will be sorry."
" Has promise, fails in Logic
",2020-05-22 00:00:00,3,"I only write reviews if a movie has elements that stand out to me. For this movie, there were so many illogicalities in this movie that I screamed at my screen out of frustration. I'm not gonna waste my time listing them as my fellow reviewers have already done.Now, granted, the suspense, cinematography, and acting was top-notch, but it was not enough to make up for the lack of logic.And the ending? There is no way Emelie could have survived being run over by the car twice, and even if she did, she could not possibly run/limp away at that speed, due to major injuries (Crushed spinal cord causing paralysis, etc.). I, as a medical student, know that for a fact.Even then she could have easily jumped away, since the car wasn't moving fast.And some scenes, like the hamster and sex tape scenes, in my eyes, served no purpose than for shock value, maybe possibly a twisted lesson in Darwinism and the birds and bees."
" What a Mess
",2020-05-20 00:00:00,4,It had all the ingredients to be a fine movie but ended up being a hodge podge of silliness. I won't repeat all the mentioned inconsistencies and plotholes. The sheer lack of common logic is frustrating up to the very end. Grade D+
" Never Leave Your Kids With A Stranger!
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,5,"This 2015 thriller tells of a young woman, Anna (Sarah Bolger) who is
a babysitter hired to watch a couple's 3 children while they celebrate their
anniversary. When the parents leave, Anna starts behaving strangely
and does unusual activities with them. Soon, one discovers that Anna is not who she seems and her real name is Emelie with an agenda. This isn't bad,
there's a couple disturbing scenes and the ending could've been better, but the cast is ok and the score is chilling. If you like psychological thrillers, give this one a try."
" Probably the worst movie I've ever finished
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,1,"I don't write many reviews - but this movie was just so ungodly bad I had to. Please, please, please save your time and money and life and skip this. At first absolutely nothing happens, and then when things do happen they're stupid.It tries so hard to avoid horror movie tropes that it has no story or action or point. The character are dumb, they make no sense and actions have no consequences.It's like if the movie was one giant plot hole but also boring and pointless."
" Why??
",2020-04-13 00:00:00,2,This movie doesn't do anything for hard core horror and psychological thrillers. They leave out too much info so the whole film is slowly drawn out and will drag you to sleep. Not going to get into details but i will say this: a real mother would never subject her kids to the things this lady does. Meaning if you plan on replacing your lost child then you wouldn't torture and expose that child before kidnapping him!! I know about loosing a child. I would never do what she does and how did she get in a position where she could replace the replacement babysitter. Who is the weird guy and what kind of ending was that?? Sorry but this director wasn't putting his best skills forward on this one.
" Great acting!
",2020-03-18 00:00:00,10,"The kids are the stars of this movie - sometimes with kid actors you're caught rolling your eyes and suffering through it. Such good actors!Very decent plot, very decent ending. I'm quarantined (like many others) right now, and just when I thought I'd run outta good movies or shows to binge, I thought eh why not - it did NOT disappoint.I'm picky about my thrillers, so I find most of these lower reviews unfair. Give it a chance :)"
" A horror gem. Very uncontrived. A family's worst nightmare.
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,10,"Emelie is a highly believable family nightmare, with the baby-sitter turning on the kids. What makes Emelie a 10 is that the kids are visibly kids, and look their ages of 4, 7 and 9. The very seriousness of how this movie is put together, with great tragic piano soundscape re-enforcing each dire turn for the worst, is another reason it scores a 10. The filmmaker's vision is a serious film about a serious possibility, and it's just so damn harrowing from the opening shock to the pull-your-hair out climax. No teen chutzpah here, just a nightmare, and it is all the more gripping for the magnificent sense of reality, and dread, it so brilliantly portrays."
" Horror gem. Perfect rendition of a family's worst nightmare
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,10,"There was a movie recently called Better Watch Out (2016), where a very young teen turns on the babysitter in a number of twisted games. That movie had chutzpah. Emelie is the reverse, the baby-sitter turning on the kids. What makes Emelie a 10 is that the kids are visibly kids, and look their ages of 4, 7 and 9. The very seriousness of how this movie is put together, with great tragic piano soundscape re-enforcing each dire turn for the worst, is another reason it scores a 10. The filmmaker's vision is a serious film about a serious possibility, and it's just so damn harrowing from the opening shock to the pull-your-hair out climax.

" Emelie Review I 69/100
",2020-02-11 00:00:00,6,Emelie made me uncomfortable and unsettling. It's a standard horror film with a strong child cast and with an interesting story. 69/100
" Waiste of time
",2020-01-06 00:00:00,3,Most of the negative reviews are spot on.This movie thankfully is under 1:30.I wouldn't recommend it.
" Disturbing on a few levels
",2019-11-19 00:00:00,6,Disturbing on a few levels but has enough shock factor to make it work checking out.
" WTH??
",2019-10-06 00:00:00,5,"This movie has the ability to keep you interested until the end. It ends and that's just it, it's over. It left about fifty unanswered questions. It's like they ran out of the budget for filming and said ""just end it and let's go on with our lives."" Pretty big let down for a movie that seemed to have potential. There is also two or three scenes that were unnecessary because of subject matter."
" Tiresome. Not even feasible.
",2019-09-22 00:00:00,2,Drawn out scenes poor reaction not a very good watch has all the right ingredients but just doesn't deliver
" One messed up show
",2019-09-05 00:00:00,3,"I like thrillers, mystery and suspense but not if it's wah disturbing. This is some seriously messed up stuff. I can't help but think even the child actors shouldn't be put in these positions."
" This is beyond bad...it's tragic.
",2019-09-01 00:00:00,1,"I do not even know where to start. A lot of reviewers have said it all, and illogical plot more full of holes than Swiss cheese paired with mediocre acting, bad cinematography decisions, and questionable themes lead to a very uncomfortable movie experience. But, just like you can't stop looking at a car accident, you can't really stop watching this mess unfold. If you like crappy movies to make fun of, which I do, add this one to your list (though some of the graphic themes are stomach churning and I don't know that I would watch the film knowing about them beforehand, so fair warning); if you're looking for an actual good thriller, though, skip this mess because it is neither good nor thrilling."
" Pretty Good
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,8,"This one was actually exciting, it got straight to the point, I though Joshua Rush was great, its always awesome when you see kids who can go there in these kind of serious psychological thrillers"
" A genuinely disturbing thriller...
",2019-07-13 00:00:00,6,"I hadn't even heard about this 2015 movie titled ""Emelie"" before now in mid 2019 when I happened to stumble upon it by sheer random luck. The synopsis for the movie sounded interesting, so I decided to pick it up and watch it.It should be said that ""Emelie"" is a somewhat odd and offbeat thriller / horror movie, but one that at the same time is very disturbing. Not so much scary and it will have you jumping in fright and sitting on the edge of the seat, but more so because it is a disturbing psychological thriller. One that director Michael Thelin managed to put to the screen quite well actually.The storyline starts out fairly averagely, but then quickly descends into events where you start to find it odd and then going even deeper until it becomes downright bizarre and disturbing. I thoroughly enjoyed the evolution of the storyline as the Anna / Emelie character's true intentions were.I think I've seen Sarah Bolger once or twice in movies before, so I am not overly familiar with her acting talents. But she really performed nicely in this particular role that she had been cast for. The movie didn't really have a huge assembly of actors and actresses, so there was a bigger performance pressure resting on the shoulders of the relatively small cast.""Emelie"" is a very enjoyable thriller, bordering on being a horror movie. I was genuinely entertained and was enjoying watching it, so I can warmly recommend that you watch ""Emelie"" if you have the chance."
" Absolute garbage
",2019-07-12 00:00:00,1,I got only to the part where she made them watch the snake eat the hamster. That was just wrong. Couldn't stand the watch the rest.
" Lazy.
",2019-07-10 00:00:00,2,"What is it with films these days? This had promise. A decent storyline, acting was alright, but then it was just stupid. You can write a movie that doesn't clue the audience in on the what or the why, but it isn't clever. It's stupid. Now it just feels like a waste of time. Try harder."
" Could be better
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,7,"There said it. If they could make it more interesting i could give full ratings but no. Still lacks somewhere. I dont know maybe the storyline, maybe the acting. But okay not that remember much.just watch it once then im done."
" Great for Netflix, Average for a Thriller
",2019-06-24 00:00:00,6,The premise is an interesting one but the film seems to fall a little short. The obsession behind why she wants that particular child is not fully explained. Why was he the chosen Cubby? Was there a resemblance or something?Also the ending is pretty implausible. No one can survive getting run over and blasted by fireworks.
" Don't Drink The Kool-Aid!
",2019-06-12 00:00:00,3,"This movie should NEVER be labeled HORROR, it's NOT, it's firmly planted it's roots in the THRILLER genre! The SECOND thing that hit me right off the bat was that the cast of kids - including and ESPECIALLY Emilie the babysitter, were AMAZING actors(the babysitter played Princess Aurora in Disney's Once Upon A Time, and has recently been seen in The SOA spin-off, The Mayans, among other hit shows) who did a TREMENDOUS job oon this movie, but the PARENTS were not only AWFUL, but they were even FILMED with cheaper equipment or SOMETHING, because the sound quality, and the video quality was MUCH WORSE! The crew did an Oopsie!- To borrow from PewDiePie! The third thing was that this woman knew WAY TOO MUCH about this family, including where they keep their stuff, what makes the kids tick like what they like/ what they fear right off the bat before getting to know them, and the family's dark secrets(and how did she get her hands on that video tape, and who even uses/ has the equipment TO videotape ANYTHING anymore?) And 4th, in today's day and age, we saw the kids mom take away his game system, which later - they did another Oopsie!!!- they then turned into it being she took away his phone tip make it a convenient plot device, but the 9yo daughter didn't have a phone?!? Even if she didn't, he saw where she put his, GO GET IT!! The 5th and final thing that hit me right off the bat was, that this is THEIR home & yard, they knew it WELL, it's DARK, why did they not ever decide to sneak into the dark backyard, hide until she gave up looking, or they get an opening, and then run too the neighbors?So, all of THAT being said, that's just the SURFACE stuff that bothered me, because I DETEST spoilers, I want to enjoy the movie for myself, so I won't ruin it for anyone else! The LADY thing I will say, and because of the above, it's only THIS- others have said that they wrapped yup the ensuing cheaply and like a typical horror film. I say Nay, or is it Neap? I digress, reading that had me SO upset I ALMOST didn't finish the movie! The way they wrapped things up was VERY satisfying, I've NEVER seen anything as ingenious as that, and I've been a huge horror buff, and my brain a repository, in the DECADES I've been watching! Until the last maybe 2 minutes, those were SO improbable, that i was left scratching my head, they wanted a sequel! But that the breaks, I wouldn't watch a sequel, because I feel robbed, and it sucks. I don't recommend the movie, it's an hour and a half of child abuse!"
" Strong start, mediocre finish
",2019-05-07 00:00:00,6,"The first hour of this film was engaging and even suspenseful. However, the last twenty-five minutes almost ruins it.It's TRUE that a bad ending can ruin a good movie. The acting was great. Especially the performances from the main three children. The cinematography was great and the atmosphere was great as well. The last act just brings the movie down. I would have loved to have given the movie an 8, but I'm giving it a 6. And that's being generous after that last act.Really a missed opportunity to have a stellar thriller."
" Not so much
",2019-04-28 00:00:00,4,"I give it a 4 only because it was a little interesting to see what she was gonna do next with the kids, and I was surprised at what her goal was"
" 6 Stars Is Plenty - Thriller It's ""NOT"" - Sick-O Babysitter It Is - Mediocre At Best
",2019-04-15 00:00:00,6,"04/15/2019 Evil babysitter called Anna does her thing, kids do their part. Scary movie it's ""NOT"", decent storyline is A-OK. Worth watching at least once, but that's about it. Bon Appetit"
" Not bad but the end could've been more thrilling
",2019-04-02 00:00:00,6,"Overall the film is good and thrilling. Sometimes it is disturbing how she treats the kids. Only the end could've been much better, it happens too quick and all of a sudden everything seems solved and handled. Could have been much scarier and thrilling, now it just seemed like there was 5 minutes left to round up the film."
" Intense, disturbing and in places infers the obscene, babysitter horror.
",2019-03-26 00:00:00,7,"Emilie (who is superbly portrayed by Sarah Bolger) is a disturbingly audacious psychotic who deceives her way into the home of a family of 5, as the babysitter, for the parents who are off out for their wedding anniversary celebration dinner.It appears that Emilie has spent some considerable time planning this deception, along with her co-conspirator boyfriend. We already know they are planning something far more malicious than theft of goods due to the crime committed in first scene, which according to some reviews is not central to the plot. It is very central to the plot, the plot needs careful observation in this movie. We do not see how they planned their crimes, but we do get to see why they planned their crimes in the old stalwart of the movies, the flashbacks.Evil to the core, the expected mindful guardianship expected by the childrens parents is recklessly abandoned by Emilie and replaced with a calous ambivilence to the childrens morality, enthusiastically enticing the children into doing what their parents would not only not allow, but would be horrified upon discovering what they had been enticed to do.Enticement soon turns to brazen bullying, which includes both that which is pyshically violenct and that which is mentally and morally obscene.Jacob (superbly portrayed by Joshua Rush) as the eldest of the siblings at 11 years old, having been unable to contact (A flaw in the plot), or receive help from any adults, is left with the ardous task of getting his siblings and himself safely away from their aggressor.The plot has perhaps a few too many flaws in it to make for a credible plot, such as the house having a telephone extension (which Emilie appears to have not noticed). Jacob could have called his parents, his neighbour or even 911, having had for much of the time, plenty of opportunities to do so.It is an intense and disturbing thriller from start to finish, despite it's obvious flaws in the plot. I would have judged a higher score if the said flaws had been better thought out."
" ""Emelie"": One Word
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,3,"Dumb.Two more.Don't watch.Okay, last one, I promise.EVER."
" Twisted babysitter
",2018-12-10 00:00:00,6,"Since the 1970's babysitters have made many appearances in horror movies, usually as victims. However Emelie bucks that trend. A babysitter - Anna - is hired to look after three children whilst their parents go out for the evening. However, appearances can be deceptive and it's not long before ""Anna"" is subjecting the kids to all manner of nasty & inappropriate things (she has her period in front of Jacob, the eldest; the daughter has her pet gerbil/hamster fed the pet python; she sits them down to watch porn on TV, etc). Anna, naturally, is not her real name - it's Emelie - and she's capable of anything, including murder. Overall this was a simple but decent suspense thriller. Acting is good, there is plenty of tension, etc. However I felt that it was let down by a fairly weak finale, a lot of good build up almost but not entirely wasted."
" Worst movie ever
",2018-12-03 00:00:00,1,"Disturbing, stupid, and twisted.Gross, not good. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time. I wish I hadn't."
" HORRIBLE MOVIE
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,1,I am disgusted that they had the hamster killed in the movie. What a disgusting thing this movie should have never been made. TERRIBLE MOVIE
" Feels like 70s-80s thriller
",2018-11-23 00:00:00,6,"Maybe it's just me, when I watched Emelie I feel like I'm watching thriller movies from 70s-80s... I don't know, like the feel, the music, the story line, the cinematography. (Don't get me wrong, I don't mean 70s-80s are bad, I just feel nostalgic). Also, Emelie's face and character reminded me to Esther from Orphan (2009) too.
Overall, I really like this movie, only I was so disappointed with the ending..., WHY they made the ending like that? I was gonna gave this movie 8 stars, but because of the ending I gave it 6."
" At Least I watched it!
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,4,Non sequitors abound but at least I watched it to the end only to feel guilty afterwards. Something for Halloween!
" Had the potential to be a good movie but ...wasnt
",2018-09-19 00:00:00,4,This movie ending was just tragic..a whole 1 hour to see her running into the woods with no explanation of what the end result was. It was also just disgusting at some points.
" You've been warned... don't lose your time
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,4,"If you expect a good film, please try another one. This is a total nonsense and badly built collection of clichés.The situations are so ridiculous that it is a bit confusing to understand what is going on. Pity! The cast, led by Sarah Bolger, who seems to be a good actress, could have been in a better act."
" Eerie, Moody Thriller
",2018-09-09 00:00:00,6,"Led by the committed performance of Sarah Bolger, 'Emelie' unfolds as a creepy and atmospheric slow burn through the first hour or so, then it shifts into a kinetic, violent thriller. It never quite becomes what I consider to be a horror flick, though certain moments will evoke horror in viewers, as the twisted babysitter torments the three siblings in increasingly unsettling ways. The music sets the tone early - right from the opening scene. A girl mentions to her friend on the phone that she isn't happy that she's been roped into babysitting tonight, then she's abruptly kidnapped by a passing car. 
 
Cut to a dad picking up a different girl and driving her to his house to babysit, and we immediately suspect that this ""babysitter"" is not who she claims to be. 
 
At first, she plays nice with the kids (two boys and a girl), returning to the oldest boy the game that his mom took away and letting them all paint on the wall. But her façade only holds up for so long. After she subjects the children to a particularly scarring video, they become suspicious of her, and I become suspicious of the film's concepts.
 
The babysitter's goals and the film's goals are not in harmony. She wants something and needs to behave normally to get it, but the film wants to scare us, and to do that she must behave abnormally. At some point the film leans too heavily toward the scare efforts, which makes the babysitter's actions and plan far less believable. 
 
The first hour or so sets the mood. It's creepy and unnerving in a tame way that's particularly effective, but this approach is then abandoned in favor of one that resembles a more conventional violent thriller. Then we see the classic tropes: Characters make illogical, flat-out-dumb decisions and viewers are ambushed by a few jump scares. 
 
The stylistic turn mostly works but is nonetheless disappointing. The early moody creepfest had me so uncomfortable that I had to watch through the partially obstructed view of my fingers. It was cringey to the maximum. Though the second half of the film contained more action, I felt less suspense. The reveal was far less affecting than the eerie unknown. Perhaps if the filmmakers put a bit more effort into the babysitter's backstory and plan, the entire movie would have held together more effectively. A few alterations could have lifted this from a watchable thriller to a terrific one."
" Decent production wasted on a dumb story
",2018-09-04 00:00:00,3,I don't see the point of tormenting the children if all she wants to steal a baby. I also can't wrap my head around the boy operating the clutch on that Stingray so easily.
" Animal cruelty
",2018-09-03 00:00:00,1,"Be warned, animal cruelty, and it is not relevant to the story, nor does it add anything. The story isn't good to begin with, and the fact that the filmmaker chose to include the pet murder says a lot."
" Terrible
",2018-08-30 00:00:00,2,"Honestly it was just disturbing,not scary. The whole bathroom scene and porn scene was disgusting, and beyond where any movie should go because they're children. Poorly done. I couldn't keep watching."
" Great idea, lazy writing **spoilers beneath the jump**
",2018-08-29 00:00:00,3,"Like many others, I was initially drawn in by Emelie's transformation from perfect babysitter to weird creep to total nightmare. I even found her motivation, once it was revealed, to be totally fine and believable. It wasn't a groundbreaking twist, but the concept and eerie beginning alone are enough to make this a unique movie. Sarah Bolger also did a great job as the sinister and deceptive conwoman. However, I just couldn't get past the multiple plotholes, which were made even more egregious by the fact that they were so easily solvable (see below if you want to see my rant about the plotholes). I was annoyed and yelling at my screen by the time the movie ended, and the bizarre, tortured and yet somehow extremely boring climax didn't help.
**spoilers**1. At no point do any of the kids call the cops, their parents, a family member, a neighbor, or ANYONE to get help. In the beginning, Emelie appears to disconnect the answering machine, but not the phone (which is a plothole on top of a plothole--I thought it was the phone at first, but the mom calls later and at least two of the phones are still connected, so...), but the kids still make no attempt to call anyone. Wtf?2. The kids have unlimited opportunity to escape and/or to defy Emelie's orders and get help, particularly when their usual babysitter stops by. They never try anything except to make one sad attempt to pass the other babysitter, Maggie, a note. There's no reason why they couldn't have just blurted out ""Help!"", and Emelie could have dealt with it from there. Their unwillingness to speak up wasn't at all believable. Maybe if Emelie had been holding the gun behind her back to scare them into silence, it would have been, but they definitely had the upper hand in that moment with Maggie standing right at the door. Anyway, even when Jake escapes the house and meets up with his friend, neither boy bothers to find an adult, which defies all sense. Their neighborhhod was FULL of people. I can't for the life of me figure out why the writer didn't just have them live out in the country, and, perhaps, make the other boy's house far enough away that running home and alerting his mom would take long enough to allow for the denouement. Would have been an easy fix.3. Sadly, in this world, there are way easier ways to steal or even to buy a child. I find it hard to believe Emelie wouldnt't have just stolen or bought a baby instead of putting herself through the trouble of finding out someone's babysitting plans, kidnapping and killing their real replacement, faking her identity, and then terrorizing a bunch of kids just to steal a boy who was already old enough to remember his real parents. I could buy it if I believed that Emelie was sufficiently nuts and obsessed with Christopher, but her weak explanation of her backstory as a bedtime story didn't convince me that she was that insane.4. Her friend tries to buy her time by crashing his car into the parents' taxi and killing himself. Just... What?! Why?! How does he expect her to escape with Christopher without him and the car to help her? Is he daft? He couldn't have just tapped the damn bumper and then gotten out and made a huge fake fuss? He couldn't have flagged them down and pretended to need a jump? Hell, he even could have tried to pretend to be the taxi! And he had the real replacement babysitter's body in his trunk, which, if anything, would immediately alert the cops that something was amiss at the house and send them straight there, giving Emelie LESS time. It made absolutely no sense.The other holes I could live with, but these disappointed me because they would have been so simple to address. It was just too much for me. Anyway, that's it. Rant over."
" Waste of time
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,1,"This movie is terrible. Super boring and gets kinda interesting toward the end, but a comple waste of time. Psycho babysitter with background that makes no sense and no motive for the things she shows the kids. This is a messed up movie and not the good kind."
" Started Out Very Good
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,5,"But then it wasn'tIt really had potential as a psychological thriller. The initial stuff the babysitter does was very unsettling and didn't know where it was going. When her intent was revealed her initial behavior didn't make sense any more and the movie turns into a Home Alone type scenario.On top of that the second half was very poorly shot, I kept rewinding to figure out what the hell was going on. Then it all fizzes out at the end with the usual evil baby sitter cliche ending you'd expect."
" It started well, but fell apart too quickly.
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,5,"Initially I thought this film was going to be great, it was unusual, and very different. The atypical babysitter under siege horror this was not, so I applaud them for twisting the original format. Unfortunately after a bright start, where you were left wondering what on Earth was going on, it just fell really flat, the plot made virtually no sense, I mean how on Earth did she know she'd end up there? What was the point in the entire charade? It makes no sense. At times I thought the script was a little tasteless to say the least, putting kids through what she did was unnecessary at times, I didn't care much for it.So it's a real mixed bag, a great idea, but unfortunately the execution was poor, the acting was great and the production values were strong. Sarah Bolger was the best thing about it. Too many wasted opportunities. 5/10"
" Really great if you're into the psychological torture of children
",2018-08-22 00:00:00,4,"The movie itself head great promise. Good acting, and great film quality at self. My problem was that I couldn't stomach watching it after the first half hour because the psychological torture of children was just too much for me to watch. I even enjoy hostel and other torture porn type movies. Nothing turns my stomach. But the mistreatment of children is very difficult for me to watch. So if you're a parent, make sure you have a strong stomach if you choose to watch this movie."
" Terrible, do not waste your time on this!
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,3,"I felt the need to make an account just to write tgis review about this movie! From the start this movie looked like it had potential but oh my it just got worse as the movie went on. The plot Is bad, the script is terrible and there is very little back story/informing you about the 'baby sitter' I just found the whole thing totally unbelievable. There is no need for her to do all the things she does to the kids before hand and if your only planning on taking one kid that coukd of been done in 5 minutes after the parents left, there was plenty of times for the kids to escape and phone the police for example and for that utter moron who was her side kick in the car 1 why is there a need to follow the parents 2 why not just pull up after they have left and take the kids and 3 why did this idiot feel the need to crash into there car to give her more time and kill himself. So to sum it up it is an utter disgrace of a 'movie'"
" Expected the usual but surprised.
",2018-08-21 00:00:00,8,"Sarah(Emelie) a does a great job in the lead and 'Jake' is my hero. I will not doubt an 11 yr old again. Kept me interested and watching intently throughout. Some people want no plot holes, no errors but hey, it's just a movie. Don't look for the flaws and enjoy the popcorn. I recommend this."
" A Parent's Worst Nightmare
",2018-08-20 00:00:00,9,"For all the nitpickers who hated this movie and gave it a low score...CHILL OUT. There are a few disturbing scenes, but the main character is a psycho, so what do ya expect? As a psychological thriller, it does a good job of creeping out the viewers. If some of the extreme scenes described in other reviews turn you off, you might be well served to skip this one and stick to Disney movies. Otherwise, prepare to be disturbed and thrilled.No complaints about the casting; in fact, the actors who played Jacob (Joshua Rush) and Emelie (Sarah Bolger) did a fine job. I found the story to be completely believable as well.A word of warning to parents; you will think twice before leaving the kiddies with a new sitter. If you do, your evening will be ruined, and you will be worried all night about what may be happening at home."
" Disgusting.
",2018-08-17 00:00:00,1,"This movie makes me physically sick. I couldn't even finish it. It's not a psychological thriller, it's a movie portraying feasible and explicit child abuse with a bunch of completely illogical wanna be thriller elements thrown in. It makes you think hard about the mental health of the writer and producers. Absolute garbage, in no way is it art."
" Absolutely horrible
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,1,"I felt I had to write this to combat the positive reviews, which must have been friends or family of the people in this movie. The entire film is beyond pointless and should never have been a movie. Babysitter wants to kidnap kid. Proceeds to do random disturbing things to the children for seemingly no reason. Parents begin to return home and she panics for time. Why? Why do any of this. Just take the kid and run.The entire time I'm watching this move, I'm frustrated trying to figure out how the writers thought any of this movie made sense or was a good idea. Please don't watch this movie."
" Wow are those kids annoying
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,4,Almost the entire dialog of the first half hour is three little kids very realistically yelling and screaming like little kids. If you want to hear little kids babbling and shouting go to the mall. For a movie though it's annoying
" Sick and perverted
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,1,"Why does someone even make a movie like this? It's a sick world when people accept a movie where children are subjected to such things as a girl intentionally putting a tampon in in front of a young boy. The whole movie was demented which seems to be the norm for Netflix these days. After they refused to cancel the movie Desire, with a 10 year old girl getting off on a pillow, I cancelled my subscription with them"
" Starts out as intriguing, then falls apart in the third act
",2018-08-10 00:00:00,4,"""Emelie"" starts out as intriguing, then falls apart in the third act. I agree with some of the other reviews alluding to this. Also, the last part of the film is so poorly LIT, it is difficult to see what is going on. Satisfactory for passing your time if nothing else is available on Netflix."
" Whole movie is pointless and unbelieveable.
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,2,"I made an account just to warn people about how awful this movie was. The entire premise is ridiculous. Why would she sit around doing random things to these random children, instead of drugging them and taking the baby immediately after the parents left? Bam whole movie over in five minutes. You can tell most of the things in this film were only added for shock factor and not to actually contribute to the story in any way. Just awful"
" Mean-spirited and Ridiculous
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,3,"There is a difference between 'horror' and 'disgusting.' I like to watch 'horror' and I don't like to watch 'disgusting.' This film was pretty disgusting. It felt like the directing was sloppy. To me, events and character dialogue didn't flow naturally. The story didn't make sense to me either. There were plot holes that you could drive a car through. I thought the film played upon people's fear of illegal immigrants which felt offensive. The film was not without its merits. I thought the acting was good. I also liked the cinematography. I did finish the movie."
" Turned a cliche theme into an unpredictable, uncomfortable thriller
",2018-08-09 00:00:00,8,"When i saw the premise of this movie I thought to myself , ""here we go, another crazy babysitter movie."" And actually didn't bother to watch it. It wasn't until a friend mentioned to me how crazy it was that i decided to check it out. I love how uncomfortable i felt the entire film. I could literally feel my hands clinching during many parts , as i didn't know what to expect . There weren't any cheap jump scares either which was also a plus , sheer intensity through dialogue , direction , and atnohsphere, the way it's supposed to be done ! With a kick ass climax ! My only critique is that i wish the baby sitter's motive would've been explained more somehow , as it's kinda confusing exactly WHY she was doing this . But other than that , GREAT flick to watch late at night with some popcorn and blankets"
" 262. Emelie
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,9,"Starts off creepily enough, a girl walking down the street gets abducted broad daylight, no one notices, seconds later, everything's calm, and the Thompsons' are planning a night out, it's their anniversary!! And the babysitter... a friend of friend of a friend, type deal, Anna is hired to watch the kiddos. And all is great for a while, til it takes a really creepy turn, involving the 11 year old boy walking in on Anna in the bathroom, but she doesn't mind, after all, she just had her period and needs the kid to find his moms tampons for her, ahh kids... And after reading the kids a bedtime story, her own life story, we know Anna is not Anna, she is um, insane... I thought it was a pretty intense horror/thriller, and I think it's worth a watch! Filmbufftim on FB."
" Okay
",2018-08-04 00:00:00,6,"Emelie's impact falls short of what was intended for it. While disturbing, it never goes full force and almost borders on tame sometimes. The motivation seemed unnecessary to me and the film lost intensity the longer it went on. Also- I'm being picky at this point!- the transitions really bugged me. But, again, it was okay."
" Good movie
",2018-08-03 00:00:00,10,"I like the movie, but i felt sad for the kids and for what happened to the hamster to. she was not a babysitter. she killed the babysitter in the beginning of the movie because she was evil and crazy and she had skinny man help her. so i rated this movie 10/10. :)"
" It's all Maggie's fault.
",2018-07-26 00:00:00,7,"If you've seen and enjoyed McG's 2017 film The Babysitter, check out Emelie from two years earlier, a nifty little shocker that also sees a young lad having to do battle with a child minder who is up to no good.The nutty babysitter in this case is Anna (Sarah Bolger), who starts to act weird as soon as the kids' parents leave the house, searching the rooms, breaking into the family security box, asking eleven year old Jacob (Joshua Rush) to pass her a tampon while she is sat on the loo, and allowing the children to draw on the walls. As the evening draws on, Anna gets progressively loopy, feeding Sally's hamster to Jacob's pet python, playing a most unsuitable video for the children, and reading little Christopher (Thomas Bair) a very strange bedtime story about a young woman whose mind cracks after she accidentally kills her baby. It turns out that Anna is actually called Emelie and that she intends to take Christopher as a replacement for her dead infant.With competent direction from Michael Thelin, natural performances from the three children and an extremely chilling turn from Bolger as a total whack job, this is, for the most part, a very effective (and sometimes rather disturbing) thriller, which is only let down by a somewhat weak payoff that feels like a set up for a sequel."
" Ranked up on rocket league
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,2,"Me and my lady had just finished a lovely carvery down the local, arrived back home and found this to watch, 30 minutes in i've already guessed the ending, so I started playing rocket league on the Nintendo switch, Mrs wasn't happy and complained a few times. Ranked up to 'pro' so fairly happy with that. Film ended exactly as guessed. Decent for background noise"
" Home alone with the babbysitter
",2018-02-23 00:00:00,5,"Needing an emergency babysitter a couple calls in Anna (Sarah Bolger). She is a kid's dream and a parent's nightmare. At 44 minutes into the film we find out things are not what they seem as the kids rebel against her.This has a similar feel as a home break-in film after a while. There were too many phones, devices in the house, and too many friends and neighbors for me to feel the endangerment. I liked how they worked back to the car and being anything you want, and Jacob taking control. Sarah Bolger did a good job with the role, it just wasn't a convincing tale. Worth a rental.Guide: 1 F-word. We hear a sex tape. Not much in nudity."
" Emelie!
",2018-02-17 00:00:00,9,"I have literally just finished watching this film, and I must say I find it to be pretty good. Horror films are very hard to get right these days, and IMDb reviews certainly are not the most kind to the genre in terms of ratings.
Emelie has a great plot to it...one that is original, and exciting. 
I would have said it was more of a thriller then a horror film, but it had a few good scary moments. 
Throughout the film, you are always kept on your toes, and I was gripped to my seat. 
Deffinately worth a watch, if your into decent modern horror films."
" Waste of time
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,1,"So slow, so bad. The concept sounds good but fail to execute. The babysitter acting was not good. Very boring, put me to sleep."
" Don't tell Mom The Babysitter's Psychotic
",2018-01-12 00:00:00,5,"Two parents go out for an evening leaving their three children in the hands of a babysitter. As the parents leave it becomes immediately apparent that the sitter is not who she appears to be and subjects the children to a number of twisted and uncomfortable activities. The first half of Emelie is a relatively slow build and does a good job of revealing the titular characters disturbing and psychotic motives and this is supported by some good performances by the three child actors. It does come close in the closing act of becoming like a dark & violent Home Alone but the filmmakers did a good job not letting it get too silly or over the top. Emelie is not a particularly memorable or original story but its fairly tense in places, well made and succeeds on the performances by its young cast of acting talent. Unfortunately it tells a simple and unoriginal story and is immediately forgettable after the credits roll. 5/10"
" Gradually falls apart
",2018-01-09 00:00:00,4,"EMELIE is a generally poor addition to the psycho-thriller genre of film-making that manages to waste a great deal of early promise in a story that gradually falls apart the more it goes on. It sees Sarah Bolger playing a mysterious babysitter from hell who puts her charges through a series of increasingly unpleasant and awkward experiences. The first half successfully builds suspense but the second half becomes very arty and drawn-out, feeling very much like the writer had no idea how to create an ending with impact. I watched this mainly for Bolger, who I loved in THE TUDORS and have followed ever since. She doesn't disappoint, and neither do the child actors here, so it's a pity the writing lets them down."
" JUST AWFUL!
",2018-01-07 00:00:00,1,"Watched this on Netflix and was hoping it was as good as some of the reviews on here, seriously!! NO it was not! how could anyone possibly rate this higher than a 3! I gave it a one star based on the 3 children's acting ability! The story really didn't go anywhere , DULL & BORING! I could have written better myself..actually my 12 yr old daughter could write better than this!"
" Nothing special
",2017-12-30 00:00:00,5,"I thought the film was very average. It was a good plot but something let it down for me, I think the classic 'capture, and the brave one saves the day!' Is slightly outdated. Although the film had some modern twists, I didn't think it was very original.Until the story started to unravel about Emelie, I didn't find it very interesting or gripping at all, just a bit weird to be honest. As the end approaches I did feel myself slightly hooked, but the majority of the film had me quite bored, if I'm honest.At the end of the day it was decent, but nothing special."
" The writing/charter development was sub-par
",2017-10-25 00:00:00,3,"Who is this babysitter? They really give little to no build up or insight as to her motives and personality. Although you can tell very quickly she's going to be a bad egg before she even gets into the house, they don't give you any back story as to why and even throughout the movie, you never really find out anything other than she must have lost a child (boy) of her own (How? Who knows) but that's about it. Pretty shallow.The opening abduction scene never really ties into the rest of the story either. Who's the blonde girl who was abducted. Who's the guy working with her that eventually crashes his car into the car the parents were riding in at the end? He killed himself doing it, so was he purposely buying her the time she needed, or was it accidental? The body of the early abductee was in it, but was she dead already, or was it from he crash? Why don't we see his face? Why was she abducted. What does it have to do with anything?Also, the are many instances for the kids to escape her, or to let others know she was a psycho that makes everything harder to swallow. Anyone who has/knows kids know none of this would play out like it did. Finally, the ending with how the kids escape her and are rescued came abruptly without a whole lot of drama, action, or thrill that movies like this typically end with. It was like they allowed the Hallmark Channel or ABC Family to produce the last 10 minutes.I mean; I've seen Sesame Street characters go down harder than this wacko babysitter and we all knew she wasn't going to be there in the driveway when the they got back to the house. I get the director was going for almost a Halloween type ending so the character could return for a sequel(s), which is why she was ""gently"" run over, but it all failed miserably. I wasn't expecting much from this movie to begin with, but even for what it was, it wasn't very good at all."
" Disturbing, weird, sick, highly inappropriate!
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,1,"Whoever makes and writes such films and that they are allowed to be published is beyond me. For all ages, it's extremely inappropriate, sick, disturbing and also very weird and creepy to want to continue watching it after certain disturbing highly inappropriate scenes. I stopped watching before half way through it. Some writers, producers and directors really freak me out and need serious questioning!"
" Cliché in babysitting
",2017-09-05 00:00:00,3,"Slow, too slow, not frightening, not scary, a bit of a thriller with no surprises. Sure the acting is good, the photography is good, technically, the film is well made but, honestly, the whole film could have lasted 30 minutes (with advs), have more suspense in it (I guess they tried to put some suspense but they failed). The pace is constant till the end making no climax at all. Don't bother to watch it, it's a C movie with a nice cover."
" Tries too hard to be good
",2017-08-27 00:00:00,4,"Your typical babysitter movie. No plot twists whatsoever. Just a crazy maniac doing what a crazy maniac does. It was really confusing — especially on the background of the Emelie character. I would think that the producers would have at least, informed us about what happened to the characters that did not make it (This does not count as a spoiler)."
" One of the creepiest horror films ever! Oh,and disgusting!!
",2017-07-26 00:00:00,9,"Emelie was a movie that I had always wanted to see. When the trailer was released,I went nuts and thought it would be a masterpiece considering it was a babysitter horror film which dose'int happen to much. Emelie was about kids who's usual babysitter dropped out and a new one came not knowing shes a bloody psychopathic woman. The film is very weird and messed up only because of the activities she shows them. The babysitter(under the name Anna but really Emelie)has a pretty sad backstory but I'm not gonna say anything. The film is very disturbing OH AND please don't let children see this or you'll never be able to go out every again thanks to them. Emelie is a very good horror film you should definitely see,I liked it!"
" A very disturbing tale
",2017-06-08 00:00:00,6,"This is a very disturbing, chilling movie - all the more so because it could very easily be a reality. Many people do entrust basic strangers, or people they know very little about, to look after their children - babysitting.Emelie is a young lady who is beyond disturbed. Although initially she comes across as a very normal, well-adjusted young woman she actually has suffered from severe trauma and loss which has just about broken her fragile mind.The one negative I feel I must highlight about this film is that it is highly likely to be a trigger for those who have suffered sexual abuse by way of exposure or being forced to watch pornographic material. There is a scene in this film where the young children are forced to watch a tape of their father having sex with a woman that is not their mother. I feel that this is an unnecessary scene which makes for some very uncomfortable viewing. It is a very extreme issue to be included in a movie of this kind. Other than to shock I really don't see what purpose adding this subject matter had. Although I felt uncomfortable with what I have mentioned above I still enjoyed the rest of the film. The story was interesting and engaging, it was not overly predictable. There was some mystery that wasn't completely expanded upon and there is scope that it could be continued.Sarah Bolger gives an outstanding performance as Emelie as do the three children in the movie. They are completely believable. I loved the concept of the 'little cubbie' and how it was told like a fairy-tale. This movie is far from perfect but it is quite fresh, modern and chilling. I hope Michael Thelin delivers some more movies from this genre."
" Just not good enough.
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,4,"I have been a fan of Sarah Bolger's work for years, and she did everything she could with an interesting plot that lacked... everything!The actors seem to do their best with what they had, and some of the suspense was actually good, the plot twist was mildly interesting at best, it just... wasn't good enough, not in the slightest.The premise is quite good actually, the execution, tho? Not so much. The filmmaker relied a lot in shock value, which is what modern horror movies have become in the lat few years, and the lack of lightning of the scenes in the third act wasn't clever, it was lazy and dumb.This film is as good as an unfulfilled promise."
