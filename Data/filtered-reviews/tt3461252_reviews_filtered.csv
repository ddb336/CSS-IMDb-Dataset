" Magnificent movie
",2021-04-03 00:00:00,10,"Yes it's an Islamic exorcism movie, I loved how the used the arabic islamic beliefs to make this masterpiece. I loved how you doubt everything that you believed in the beginning."
" What a waste of time
",2021-03-21 00:00:00,1,This movie is a miraculous time machine . It brings you back to 1900 where silly ideas exist combined with the worst acting ever . I'm sure the director is hanging up there with his ridiculous capabilities.The really disappointing thing that they released a second part and I intend to see it in only one condition ( IF I WANT COMMIT A SUICIDE )
" I expected more ...
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,2,"As boring as hell
I expected more ...
The cast is perfect but the story was so regular and tired. These kinds of stories have been used in lots of American movies. I could expect every scene before it's shown to me."
" A must see
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,10,One of the best Egyptian movies as I tend to like American movies but this is an exception.

" from the best egyptain horror Movies
",2020-02-20 00:00:00,8,"From the best Egyptian horror Movies or Arab world , The Blue Elephant received mixed reviews but performed well in the Egyptian Box-office during Eid time. The film did not follow the formula of the recent slew of Egyptian comedies, yet it managed to win over audiences across the Arab region. The film gained up to 30 million Egyptian pounds, which is approximately 4.2 million U.S. Dollars"
" Magnificent
",2019-12-02 00:00:00,8,"This isn't a normal movie , it did hurt my mind a lot .
I'm literally lost in the beauty of every scene , i'm not sure if it was the director , cgi , actors or the composer .im writing this with a shock all over my face , mind and spirit .
I've never watched a movie with so much ....
i'm out of words , watch it for yourself ."
" The best film in year2014
",2019-10-04 00:00:00,10,The best Film Karim was the best Actors in film with Khaled Elsawiy in Shrief Alkordy
" The best production Egypt has produced to date
",2019-08-16 00:00:00,10,"A unique story, and a great production. The best production Egypt has produced so far."
" The rare 10/10
",2019-08-10 00:00:00,10,"The best in both Arabic, Hollywood, and Bollywood the last 10 Years... 3rd I think will be the last and Quraan will solve it"
" One of the best Arabic movies of all time
",2019-08-08 00:00:00,8,"Great directing, amazin music, acceptable acting, but unfortunately bad VFX.But it's still one of the best movies of the Arabian cinema."
" I had every right to be skeptical about this one
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,6,"Literally everyone I know that watched this film kept pushing me into watching it. claiming it is some sort of a cinematic achievement. I don't think it is bad, but seriously Egyptians and Indians need to stop over-rating movies made by their countries. They're driven by a sense of patriotism that I cannot understand, which usually leads to many unfair ratings like the 8.2 in the blue elephant.
I was impressed with the cinematography but I did not appreciate the slow motion scenes. Also the background music was strongly unrelated in some scenes. The overall emphasis on alcohol addiction seemed like an exaggeration to me and the pacing of the story is all over the place.
still, this might be one of the best Egyptian movies I have seen and is an exciting new approach in Egyptian cinema. I enjoyed it but it doesn't belong anywhere near the 8 category."
" Well the first egyptian/arabic movie to satisfy audience
",2019-07-28 00:00:00,10,"The blue elephant 2 actually was made with high quality as foreign movies , amazing graphics and storyline . highly recommended to watch"
" Medically wrong!
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,3,"Guys!
Am I the one here to notice that the movie used the term and the diagnosis (schizophrenia) mistakenly!
I know that they may overlap with each other, but people schizophrenia do not experience being in another personality! There's another disorder called Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), or Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD) all the same with different terminology.
People who are diagnosed with DPD are the ones who experience dissociation from their personality BUT NOT SCHIZOPHRENICS!Please guys I'm dying cuz I haven't found any comment regarding this issue, am I right about this or wrong???
If I am, then the movie is not worthy of your time."
" prefiction üëåüèΩ
",2019-07-26 00:00:00,9,"The best arab thrillir movie üëåüèΩüòç , and the sound track just perfect."
" Amazing movie
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,10,It's very beautiful movie i ever seen it's very amazing
" Egyptian movie
",2019-07-05 00:00:00,10,"We cannot classified this movie as horror movie since most of them without any specific story, however the blue elephant is mixing between drama, horror and romantic.
Watch it and you will never regret."
" Greatest movie from Egypt.
",2019-06-18 00:00:00,10,"Great movie from Egypt, Karim Abd-Elaziz, Khaled ElSawy."
" A change in the Egyptian cinema
",2018-08-24 00:00:00,8,"This film is probably different than any Egyptian film ever made, it was a bald move but a good one though. The plot is intriguing until the last minute, the performance by all the actors is good. The music is just great, it puts you right in to the climate of the film. The cinematography and film editing are good which is really surprising for an Egyptian film.I recommend this film to any Egyptian who stopped following Egyptian film as its quality had dropped drastically."
" Very cool
",2017-10-25 00:00:00,8,"I liked this movie a lot. The plot had lots of interesting twists and turns and kept me guessing. The pacing was good and I wasn't bored at any point. However, I thought the ending was a little too happy to be credible, especially the part about Sheriff's death sentence being commuted (granted I don't know anything about Egyptian law, so I don't really know what ""believable"" means in this context). Also, LOL at DMT in pill form (and the trip sequence didn't seem very DMT-like). But these are minor quibbles, I heartily recommend this to anyone who likes a good story."
" Way too long, overdone
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,5,It's an average film with many special effects to hide the mediocrity of the story. I'm assuming the film makers thought that if they added glossy CGI effects no one would notice that the screenplay really isn't all that great.The film is too long and it becomes tiring. This should have been a 90 minute film at tops.There are other films with similar ideas that are much better made.I'd skip it.
" achievement in Egyptian standards but not on the others
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,7,"first of all , there has been rumors that the movie has been copied from the tattooist , yes but not all of it ... this the best Egyptian film in the last decade ....but there are many flaws ...the visuals has also flaws ....this is the best performance ever done by Kareem abdelaziz ...Khaled elsawy was ordinary as well as Nelly Kareem ...the first act was slowly paced and wasn't even necessary , the second act was somehow good ..the third act is unbelievable and stunning ....the story has some of the Egyptian melodrama in the first act .. the movie is not complex as people may assume ..even the third act wasn't that much complex ...this movie needs support but also need criticism in order to reach for more improvement ...the movie is not in the Oscar level so it didn't deserve an Oscar nomination for best foreign film ...by the end we need to celebrate this film for its amazing story telling , visual effects , cinematography and directing which we have not seen in decades."
