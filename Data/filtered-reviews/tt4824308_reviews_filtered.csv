" Practically Rolled the Eyes Out of My Head
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,1,"PureFlix strikes again in this... inspirational sequel to God's Not Dead. Once again basing an entire film around a single mediocre song from a band that's about as memorable as Trapt (remember they did that one song? Nobody cares about the rest), God's Not Dead 2 showcases the finest case of victim complex that has perhaps ever been committed to the big screen. From the brilliant mind that brought you God's Not Dead comes this story of a teacher who dared to mention religion in her class... and was taken to court over it!
Sure, we live in a divided time when religion isn't (and probably shouldn't be) typically brought into a professional or classroom setting. However, for the amount of religion the teacher gives her class, it's hardly justifiable to assume that there would be a court case. But, yet again, this is the Christian attempt to show how persecuted they are in the world today, when in reality the most punishment they would've gotten is a call or two to the principal to complain. It's not that deep, Karen.
Yet this film, just like its predecessor, tries so damn hard to make it that deep. The characters are, once again, purely one-dimensional, the plot is nonsensical from a real-world perspective as well as a legal one, and the execution is an absolute mess. It's like trying to eat a crumbly cookie that is falling apart in your hands before you even have a chance to digest it. It's pure propaganda for the Christians, and it gives them yet another reason to point and say how hard they have it in life, while they actively cause harm and hardship for legitimate minorities with their propaganda.Once again, the all-too-forgettable Newsboys come in with their song, and we get the single biggest joke in the Christian entertainment industry. Just like the first film, this one ends with a calling to text everyone in your contact list to let them know that ""God's Not Dead."" So, for the uninitiated at the time, not only did you get a ridiculous text at the end of the first movie to let you know that your friends and family support one-sided, biased propaganda pieces... but you got it a second time to let them know that they paid to see the same sort of situaiton transpire a second time! Again, we get a massive misrepresentation of everyone who is not Christian, painting them as unintelligent idiots, yet again furthering the divide between the faithful and the atheists. This is just an hour and a half of ""poor me"" group therapy. Oh, those poor Christians have it so hard.Yet, they still had the opportunity to give this film a theatrical release. And it came out a year before the Disney Beauty and the Beast remake, which drew controversy because of a gay undertone between two characters. Tell me again how ""hard"" Christians have it? The most unfortunate part of this whole thing is that they don't see anything wrong with these movies, and so they continue to fund the industry and we have to watch as mediocre film after mediocre film make their way out into the world. When is enough enough? When will they realize they're being pandered to like toddlers, wake up and demand quality product?This film is a joke, just like the predecessor and, much like the rhetoritc from which it's supposedly based, it falls apart before it ever has a chance to come together. Hard pass on this ""franchise."""
" Really, really, really boring
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,4,This is legitimately one of the most boring and uninteresting movies I have ever seen. It's a really disappointing sequel.
" Even more relevant in 2021
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,10,"This movie's plot may have seemed a bit far fetched when it came out five years ago, but it really hit home when I watched it for the first time last night. It covers many themes we're seeing right now, primarily the cancel culture of the left, and the importance to stand up for the truth no matter the cost. Melissa Joan Hart delivers a string performance as the film's protagonist. A must-see for Christians of all walks, or anyone concerned with the direction our society is headed. For the record, while I do think it's a strong and moving film, the ten stars is to counterbalance the trolling atheists' one star reviews."
" Excellent Thought Provoking Story
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,9,"I like the way the movie poses the other side so strong. The movie is not afraid to play devil's advocate. The acting is pretty good, and the concept is not so far off when you consider the latest cases taken up by the ACLU. Bottom line, this movie is for Christians, Atheists, Agnostics and anyone with an inquisitive mind. If you think the patriarchy is keeping a stranglehold on your independence, this movie is for someone else. Better yet, if you rated ""The Shape of Water"" above 5 stars, this movie is probably not for you. If you thought ""Call Me By Your Name"" was a movie worth watching, this movie is not for you...."
" Religion vs State
",2021-01-05 00:00:00,10,"Another excellent example of the State vs. Church/Religion/God based faith. I have always been spiritual myself, believer of God and Jesus Christ. I have recently whole heartedly devoted myself to Christianity and the persecution prophesied by Jesus Christ for being his follower is all too real. The 40 years I have been alive I have seen the ever growing seperation of State and God occuring in the U.S. I am a patriot and decorated combat veteran, and this seperation has me sickened. This movie is an excellent sequel that outlines this issue, and restores hope and faith to those in the darkness. It also strengthens hope in faith in those who follow Jesus Christ. I thought it was very well delivered and if it seems directionally in favor of Jesus Christ, that's because it is and rightfully so. After all, that is the basis and theme of the movie and it's predecessor."
" Great Movie for those who are struggling about Jesus being Real
",2020-11-14 00:00:00,10,Praying for those who are struggling with their beliefs. This is a great movie and betrays the world we live in. I know some Atheist and this movie does not betray them as bad people to me. Seems like alot of people are missing the point. Jesus is Real.
" Thought-provoking for some, disappointing for me
",2020-10-31 00:00:00,5,"God's Not Dead 2 is a sequel to the first, which wasn't well-received by critics for its preachy tone and others calling it unrealistic. This one is certainly a disappointment-at least, it was for me. The film starts off pretty entertaining at first, but then gets more boring as it goes on.
Several of the courtroom discussion scenes didn't grasp my attention like I wanted them to. I have been riveted by movies where people just talk and that's it (Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, 12 Angry Men, Witness for the Prosecution) and this movie still lost my attention.
Even the second time I watched it, I was prepared for the scenes, but again, I lost interest in the discussions. Therefore, the film fails to deliver its message effectively to the audience because it ends up boring the audience, which weakens the impact of the audience.
Now, this film is certainly thoughtful in terms of its themes, and I understand how the themes could provoke some discussion after watching the film, but otherwise, God's Not Dead 2 isn't really worth your time."
" Christian Hating Atheists Responsible For Negative Reviews
",2020-09-13 00:00:00,10,"The negative reviews left by Christian-hating atheists directly parallels the theme of the movie. They're so filled with hate that they took the time to leave unfair ratings of the movie just to bring it down, because they gain satisfaction through hate. It's sad really, because even from a non-religious standpoint, the God's Not Dead movies are pretty good. The arguments presented are always fair, sound, and factual... especially in this second movie of the series, which mostly takes place in a court room. Christian or not, see these movies. They're fantastic and entertaining to say the least."
" An atheist nightmare
",2020-07-15 00:00:00,10,A great film. Atheists will find fault with it. But that is their problem.
" Fantastic movie
",2020-07-12 00:00:00,10,Really enjoyed this movie. Could watch over and over. A real feel good movie and so true
" SSSHH! We Don't Talk About Jesus Here!
",2020-07-01 00:00:00,1,"In 2016, there was a masterpiece of Christian film-making that was about Christian persecution. In it, the Christian could have lost everything but they suffered the persecution and in the end, after all of the trials, remained true to their faith. That movie...was Martin Scorsese's SILENCE. Unfortunately, God's Not Dead 2 claims to be a similar kind of movie, and it's not.The movie follows a teacher named Grace Wesley, played by Melissa Joan Hart. Apparently, in her public school, she is the only Christian teacher, and all of the other ones are atheists. In one class, she is teaching about the non-violet protest approaches of Martin Luther King Jr. and Gandhi.A student asks if that is like the teaching of Jesus to love our enemies. The teacher agrees and says: ""The author of Matthew cites Jesus as saying..."" and she quotes Matthew 5:43-44. This is perfectly fine and within context, but Pureflix believes that if a public school teacher did this, they would go to jail.Granted, Grace does not go to jail, but she might- and the majority of the movie is a courtroom drama deciding through many witnesses if she deserves jail time and the loss of her job.As with the first God's Not Dead, all of the atheists are jerks and/or villains. One character Peter Kane- played by Ray Wise, says that in court, they will ""prove once and for all...that God is Dead."" That's not even what the case is about, but you have to hint a title drop somehow I guess.He also tells Grace's lawyer that he ""hates what people like your client stand for."" In many ways, Wise's character is supposed to be a demon-like character.Kane argues in the court case that if he quoted the Quran, you would infer that he was a Muslim. That is not true. A person of other faiths can know quotes from other religious texts.In fact, ignoring faith for a second, did you know Ernest Hemingway wrote a book called ""The Sun Also Rises"", which was named after Ecclesiastes 1:5? Well, his title references The Bible, so he must be a Christian! Except no, Hemingway was an atheist. See the problem with that argument?Another flaw with that Quran argument is with The Torah. If I quote the Torah, am I Jewish? No, because I'm a Christian, and the first 5 books of The Bible is The Jewish Torah!In another scene, a character gets a heart attack and Kane retorts ""I guess that proves that God IS dead!"" Yeah...and HOW does it?Back to Grace, she suggests to her lawyer that they argue that she was teaching from a historical perspective, and teach that Jesus was a historical man, rather than God in the flesh. First of all, that was what she was teaching-from a historical context. 2nd of all, that would go against her Christian beliefs. You know, the ones under attack in this fictional movie?So they gather a couple of authors to defend this. One is Lee Strobel, an atheist-turned-Christian who wrote The Case For Christ, a book giving historical evidence that Jesus existed. Grace's lawyer asks him for some evidence that Jesus existed.Lee offers the date. Our calendar is based on Jesus's birth(which is not fully true, our calendar has an error and so Christ was born 4-6 years Before Christ according to our 2020 year), and that's quite a feat if He never existed.That within itself doesn't prove much. May the 4th for Star Wars fans is May The 4th Be With You Day, but that date does not prove that there is a Luke Skywalker!I'm not going to go through all of the arguments that God's Not Dead 2 gives, but just know that in a real court of law they wouldn't hold any water. And no real court of law would have a case like this anyways.Apart from the Grace case, the news-reporter from the first movie, like I said in that review, is cured of cancer because she comes to faith. Also, a Chinese kid from the first movie converts to Christianity and his father disowns him, just like the Muslim girl in the first God's Not Dead.Another problem the movie has is a scene with Pat Boone, playing Grace's elderly father. In one scene, he says, in reference to a student's brother's death, that ""Atheism doesn't take away the pain, it just takes away the hope."" So, when a Christian's loved one dies, they never lose hope?Pat also says this line: ""People often forget that the most basic human right of all is the right to KNOW JESUS!"" Not only is that line delivered so poorly, but it's false. When it comes to ""basic human rights"", we are named 3 core ones in the Declaration of Independence: Life, Liberty, and The Pursuit of Happiness. Not the right to be a Christian.In fact, The First Amendment of the Constitution states that we have a freedom of RELIGION. That is not just Christianity. That's Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism, and x, y, and z. So we have a RIGHT to believe in other gods, we CHOOSE, through free will, to accept Christ.I also find it ironic that Pat Boone's character has this line of thinking. He was in The Greatest Story Ever Told as the Angel At The Tomb, and the Jesus in that movie, Max Von Sydow, was an atheist. Did he think Sydow had no hope or ""basic right"" 51 years ago? Chew on that for a minute.As you can see, GND2 is pretty much on par with the original on spreading flawed lies about the state of Christianity in America. I used to support these movies but I see the issues with them now and I regret taking so long to see that.God still isn't dead, but this franchise should be.Note: On You Tube, please see Say Goodnight Kevin's 52 minute review or What The Flick's short review-but discretion is advised, as there is some profanity in that one.Reverse Recommendation(EDIT): For a better courtroom drama, see A Few Good Men instead. It's a great movie(one of my favorites) and even though the director is an atheist, there are multiple mentions of God and The Bible and there is a great message about doing what is right, no matter the consequences. GND2 could have taken many lessons from this movie, even with it's R rating."
" Not an example one for Christians
",2020-06-19 00:00:00,1,"If I were in that teacher's position, I'll just do what enemies want. I'll also give my left cheek to get slapped. I will also quit the school and not seek justice. Sorry for my bad English."
" Truth that needs to be told
",2020-05-18 00:00:00,9,Freedom of speech applies to everyone. A light needs to be shone on religious censorship.
" The sheer level of incompetence.
",2020-05-05 00:00:00,1,"Oh my another banger. JK this sucks. Being a Christian I am embarrassed by this Pure Flix trash. PS: STOP ACTING LIKE ATHIESTS ARE THE DEVILS ARMY, GOD LOVES THEM JUST AS HE LOVES US!!!"
" Keep making movies, better ones
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,8,"In general, I want to say the second looks better and sounds better than the first one. It is more professional.People are complaining about how real the film is. Come on, films are not real. Even the best ones. They are created with a message and everything happens in the film is to bring that message to you.I give the film 8/10 not because it deserves it, but because it doesn't deserve a ton of negative reviews. Trust me, Christian films are hard to make, and to please their audiences is even harder.Keep making more films guys. But you have to make it better. Focus on acting and go deeper in developing characters. God be with you guys!"
" Amazing movie
",2020-04-11 00:00:00,10,God's not dead. He is surely alive and that is a fact.
" Not as good as the original, still great
",2020-04-09 00:00:00,9,"This movie is amazing. Melissa Joan hart is great, the story and the way it is told is fantastic. I am a big fan of these movies. I don't believe this one is as good as the original, but still fantastic."
" crap
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,1,"Is crap too short of a review
How long and how many times should one say a film is bad (in how many different synonyms of BAD should my review be
There is no need for redundancy here: this movie to other cinema work is like is like Trump to other presidents"
" THIS MOVIE IS INSPIRING AND INTRIGUING
",2020-03-25 00:00:00,10,"This movie is truly inspiring and beautiful. I have been a Christian since I was ten years old and lost my way for many years after coming to terms with my being gay at age 16 - The preacher spoke against :LGBTQ people and I left the church I grew up in that same day.I went through drug addiction, abuse, bullying, mental illness, and so much more than what a review should say about the person writing it. But God pursued me even after I turned away from Him. In this movie a young girl who loses her brothers and is filled with sadness, devastation, and hopelessness begins to show signs of her inner conflicts and pain to her high school teacher.The teacher (who happens to be a Christian) confronts the girl in true concern towards what she is going through. (God how I wish someone showed concern towards the bullying and hardships I went through other than the guidance councilors). This teacher also takes care of her disables father.She lets the girl know that if she needs anyone to talk to she is always there. (How caring, how kind....so many people are not like that today). The girl missing her brother, her parents emotionless towards his death and towards her mourning.....turns to the teacher the next day.)While discussing her sorrow with her teacher, the teacher asks her a simple question ""Did your brother ever believe in something more?"" She replies ""I don't know? The teacher asks again ""Do you?""
A challenging question I would say for someone who was never exposed to a Christian upbringing (like myself). Long story short, the teacher mentions faith in a round about way, faith in Jesus and truly an after life, heaven.
The following day in class, the teacher is discussing a topic with the class about non violence. Long story short the same student brings up a question relating the topic to Jesus. Rather than say ""I can't answer that because it is a religious reference"" she answers the girl's question in agreement to the Bible and a scripture that attests that the girl's question to the teacher about Jesus was correct. Religious or not, the bible holds and teaches all of the same principles any parent would teach their child in retrospect to morals, forgiveness, and how to deal with many negative events in the lives of every person alive today.Being persecuted by for this by the school, a war rises. And people begin to become angry at the teacher and wish to use her as an example to make religion or talks of Jesus at school ridiculous. Long story short....This becomes a full blown court room movie - which gets truly suspenseful and mind boggling for those who are not acquainted with a faith based way of life or a personal understanding of faith and the proof of God;s existence only revealed through it.This movie inspired me in so many ways.....for one when selecting the jury members the accusing council based their choices by appearance and signs of faith or a lack of as did the defense - However some people who were presumed to be non christian by appearance proved the prosecution wrong -
You can't judge a book by its cover is one thing I could find as a message in itself.
Secondly, the teacher could easily had apologized and let these people dominate her and get away with hurting her reputation and using the situation as an excuse to bash all people who believed in Jesus.Had we LGBTQ people of the world did not protest against prop 8 and for equality we would have been hushed and no one would have won rights to get married as lgbtq today.Though it was more so Christians who opposed us and put us down - Many of us never associated this to be an act from God himself. I love Jesus Christ and I am gay......We need to stop bashing Jesus and God for the fault of people who use his name in a way to portray him falsely.This movie inspired so much more and for anyone who needs inspiration and guidance in a hard time and this movie looks like a good one to watch - ignore the anti Christians because they've just been hurt by Christians so much they bash all Godly movies with the exception of the more popular ones.How can I be gay and a Christian? Ask God because he revealed himself to me in pursuit of me after I left him, fell into darkness, and became mentally insane for years.I really don't like debating my personal observations/theories/or spiritual intuitions against reviewers directly - but the truth is that most of these reviews seem to be written by people who hate Christians and or Christianity -
Basically people who would match some of the characters in this movie....but I really think it is unfair for any person who isn't a Christian/or pro Jesus' review of this movie to be taken seriously by anyone with a faith in God who is seeking a movie for inspiration or a possible answer to something they are going through,"
" Different From the First One, But Still Great Movie!
",2020-03-17 00:00:00,10,"It is different, but the debate is still going on between Christian's faith and, I guess, society. A debate between a lady talking about her faith or her answer to one of the student's question about Jesus, which caused her to be sent to court because it violated the separation of church and state. Luckily, her lawyer, was able to prove that what she did was not a violation. You will see why.
Some might say it is ridiculous, or just not enough, like evidence, but it is enough. This is still a good movie! I recommend watching this and the previous movie as well!"
" Why did the Atheist bother watching this movie to start with?
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,8,"You knew it was a Christian based movie. You know you wouldn't believe in it's message. You knew it would anger you. What was the point of watching it, then getting on this website to spew your attack against Christianity?This review might get yanked by the owners of this website, but what kind of website is this? Is it one where people review movies based on things like plot, acting, musical score, etc? Or is it one where people get to attack a movie because they are angry with the fact that it's about Christianity, and they don't like Christianity, so they are going to bombard it because they feel it is trying to 'cram religion' down societies throat? Listen very carefully...""IF YOU KNOW IT'S A CHRISTIAN MOVIE ABOUT CHRISTIAN THINGS, NO ONE IS FORCING YOU OR ANYONE ELSE TO WATCH IT.""As for a review of the movie...you'll like it, if you're a Christian."
" It will fortify you faith (if you want to)
",2019-08-08 00:00:00,10,If you are going through mockery or challenges in your life because of your faith - this movie will strengthen it.
" Good movie
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,10,"All the people who panned the movie do so for 1 reason - Hatred of Christians. The movie is entertaining and it is nice to see people make a decision about what they want to believe in. Good, easy, non stressful movie."
" A study in victim complex delusion...
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,1,"Like so many other Christian films, this one is staggeringly clueless of how the real world works. The filmmakers display zero understanding of things like non-religious education and courtroom procedures. As always, the dialogue penned by Christian writers for ""atheist"" characters is unintentionally hilarious. It's painfully obvious that no one involved has ever spoken to an actual atheist. The film also cites cases in which Christians faced repercussions for trying to force their beliefs onto others in ways that blatantly violated the law as ""Christian persecution."" The whole mess suggests a complete disconnection from reality."
" God's Not Dead 3?
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,1,"Is there going to be another sequel? Yes, please! The reviews are very entertaining! :D"
" Thought provoking film
",2019-05-18 00:00:00,8,"I wanted to watch this to see Jim Wallace the Cold Case detective and wasn't disappointed with his part, overall i enjoyed the jury scenes they managed to build a lot of tension, watch this film with an open mind who knows where it might lead you!"
" Better than the first
",2019-05-03 00:00:00,6,"The premise and the whole set up may not have been realistic but I do think it is a sign of things to come. The hate for Christians and what they believe in is only growing. Yes, Christians still make mistakes and there some who even claim to be ""Christians"" but I do think there is enough evidence to warrant belief in a God. The main issue I think is the plot of the movie and the way the story is told. I think this movie should be judged based on its story-telling and not on its religious views which we all have a right too."
" God not dead 2 is trash
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,1,As a Christian this offended me its absolutely horrible I hate how they play the victim card in this movie.
" Gods not dead 2 is horrible offensive movie
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,1,This movie is absolute garbage. I hate how they paint atheists as horrible people and Christians as the perfect people that can do no harm. If your an atheist this movie should offend you. If your Christian this movie should offend you. Overall the movie is just a trash drama about a teacher who can't teach her kids about god.
" Drama?
",2019-04-18 00:00:00,1,"How can this not be categorized as ""Religious""? Pat Boone? Are you kidding me? What a woeful final film for Fred (Dalton) Thompson. Filmed entirely in ""scenic"" Little Rock, AR. The rural surrounding counties are ground zero for redneck state troopers, and other strange things. Worse, almost everyone has red hair! 40 years ago, State Troopers stopped car one night in a local trap, then issued a $25 fine for some inane local ordinance in Nevada County. Ended up saving at least 6 lives and 2 - 18 wheelers from colliding. 1 hour went by until finally troopers came. Told them what had occurred. They didn't even say ""Thank you"". What a terrible place."
" A sign of the times
",2019-01-22 00:00:00,10,For those calling this a piece of propaganda that is not based in reality perhaps you should take a look around. God is being taken out of the public square in the name of diversity and is being replaced by evil. In a world without God everyone is governed by their own moral compass. Love this flick and it hits the heart bone everytime. If you haven't felt judged for your faith yours not living it.
" Hater reviews prove the movie correct
",2019-01-19 00:00:00,10,"Cold case proof of Christianity mocked by left wing haters. It proves the case for the movie, why such truth is necessary and must be told.See the movie yourself, ignore the lies told here."
" Good faith based arguments
",2019-01-04 00:00:00,10,The movie was touching with excellent spiritual as well as legal lessons.
" Reflects reality. Beware 1/10 reviews given by trolls.
",2018-11-26 00:00:00,8,"How accurate it this movie regarding Christiatianity being oppressed by the media and social trends? Just look at how many hostile reviews giving 1/10 and mock it, and you see how much truth the movie speaks to our current social situation. It is no lie that the laws are being pushed by such people for political agenda. I know friends who are threatened to be fired for saying the name of Jesus by their boss, and another lady who works as a door person and was not allowed to talk about Jesus. Living in Chicago, I have witnessed and experienced visible persecution and oppression even in thw Christian community for speaking about my faith a way that apparently was deemed ""coded"" or ""misleadin"". One time a bunch of people laughed at my face because I said God spoke to me. They shame you or threaten you so you cannot share what actually happened. And then they slander God and you saying Christians are ignorant or are dumb. Well, except half my Christian friends hold double master degrees or doctorate. We also tend to be the most globally traveled. So honestly it's just slander. Watch all three movies and think for yourself. These are not supposed to be for entertainment, so of course you can't expect comedy or adventure. People need to understand despite perception, most real Christians are very low key about their sufferings, injustice done to them and what they do for society. So you're not gonna know true Christianity from the media or online reviews from atheists. Go to an evangelical community church and find out for yourself."
" Enjoyed the whole film.
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,10,I know it is not popular to like a film that has nice things to say about God. It is not popular to enjoy a movie about the college experience that is different from the mainstream. However this is a classic film that gets to one important point. Can you be a Christian and survive in the Atheistic Secular University world. The answer is yes and you will pay for it somehow someway. But don't worry Christians have been paying for it for 2000 years and it won't stop soon. The righteous will be persecuted. Enjoy the film you are probably next.
" A good movie for all faiths
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,10,This is a weightlifter of a faith movie. Giving praise to the Lord and hitting the enemy with love. You need to see this
" Great inspirational movie
",2018-06-17 00:00:00,10,No one should be afraid to be able to stand up for their faith. The movie displayed the animosity the media and some organizations hold towards Christians. As a Christian I found the movie to engaging and truthful.
" Wouldn't ever happen in real life
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,1,"So, I stumbled upon a video talking about why Christian movies suck or at least are bad and it mentioned this film. I literally watched this and thought to myself: This would never have happened, just a warning to be careful about the way you use words because people can misconstrue what you say Grace is a HS teacher who answers a question from a student about God while they're learning about MLK, Gandhi and nonviolent struggle. THAT IS IT, that is the WHOLE PREMISE OF THE FILM! So, I hated this film mostly because of the fact that this film is not realistic. I couldn't find one single instance of the events of the film ever happening in real life. Also, the cases it cites at the end of the film like the first, have NO APPLICABLE CASES to the movieI saw this before I watched Part 1 but I'm going to watch IT and 3. Personally I feel if you need a movie to prove God's Not Dead then you need to ask yourself a few questions."
" No one cares!
",2018-03-29 00:00:00,1,Trying so very hard to be relevant today is not working for this or any other Christian-themed movies... the writing is on the wall for you cult-members... your entire set of beliefs (and movies) are literally locked in the guillotine ready to be excised... for good reason!
" Open your eyes to Public School
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,8,"Amazing the hateful reviews toward this movie. In today's godless world it's not a surprise. What the movie shows is the total Hippocrates in current school systems ( mention anything or anyone but Jesus ) I'm sure actors praying and living righteous on camera just infuriates the liberals mind, why? Because they have no clue of God or his mercy and grace. Look at the public schools today in 2018 and see what's happening yet there can be no place for Christians or love and peace and goodness. The film perfectly portrays the prejudice of government schools and a nation of non-believers who will go to any lengths to shut up the Christian community..."
" If you're conservative and right winger you're a good christian
",2018-01-23 00:00:00,1,"Wasn't the last film all about the christian guy being oppresed by the views of his teacher? But now the teacher wants to do the same. This film plays to conservative christians as a propaganda film to say that christians are persecuted horribly for the ""evil"" liberals and generally speaking that's the general message in all the films of this company. Heaven is only for right wingers fellows.
A false idea of persecution while also saying that if you're atheist or left winger a really bad person. 
Way to go, conservative christians, that's the true message of love of Jesus"
" Honestly Disgusting
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,1,"Until today I hadn't heard of the God's Not Dead films and I went into this hoping for a reasonably intelligent debate on the merits and flaws in the concept of religious belief.I was massively disappointed, confronted instead with a stereotypical slimy villain and his smirking cohorts, every one of them casting smug looks at Melissa Joan Hart's character, who spends most of her time looking like a kicked puppy.The film paints atheists as angry anti-religion warriors with a personal vendetta to destroy faith, while Christians are portrayed as innocent victims of the evil non-believers.This plays out like an oversimplified, highly biased fairy tale you might tell children about the devil hiding under their bed if they don't say their prayers every night.It's absurd, blatant Christian propaganda and should be considered an insult to believers and nonbelievers alike."
" Don't listen to the haters
",2017-12-16 00:00:00,10,"A lot of reviewers are hating on this film for the wrong reasons, they're using their emotions to review a film instead of reviewing a film for simply being a film. If this movie story line was a non-Christian one about a person being taking to court for attempted murder or something like that - reviewers would probably say how great the film is. A lot of people who dislike this movie hate God and hate Christians, therefore they are not reviewing this type of movie properly, but it is also more than that....A film like this can convict one's conscience and get them thinking!As a Christian it could seem that i'm being biased by giving this flick a 10 out of 10 rating, but to be honest i actually dislike most Christian movies because most of the time the majority of Christian films have terrible actors and very bad production, scenery, e.c.t. A lot of Christian movie companies don't have much money so everything looks cheap and terrible, this is not a good enough representation, and frankly i'm sick of it, there are only a few decent Christian movies out there, God's Nor Dead 2 is one of them. The first movie - God's Not Dead 1 wasn't very good, the writers have stepped up their game with this sequel. With this second movie instalment the story line is better than the first, and the overall film is fast-paced.God's Not Dead 2 has a decent message and it shows us two different mindsets. It makes no sense when some people call this flick a ""biased religious propaganda movie"", if it truly was that - all the characters would all be believers.God's Not Dead 2 - A suspenseful drama flick. Recommended."
" It's About Time...
",2017-10-29 00:00:00,10,"...movie makers show that Christians have a right to their beliefs, and should DEFINITELY fight for what they believe in. Very well written. It is nice to see some actors and actresses we do not see much of any more doing some of these Christian movies. There's been several and I hope they make more. Turning a simple statement from a public school teacher, into proving that Jesus really did exist, and how our beliefs in faith still have some weight. I doubt this would ever happen unless there were some kind of revival in America. Liberal Communist supporters have pretty much destroyed our court system so this was a refreshing look at what could possibly happen if Christians banded together to help restore America to a respectable place. So excellent job, well done. Tell the producers to make more like this!"
" Atrocious Film, Great Song
",2017-10-09 00:00:00,1,"Not since 1987, when the arm-wrestling ""classic"" ""Over The Top"" gave us Kenny Loggins' hit single ""Meet Me Halfway,"" or the home-nursing ""epic"" ""Disorderlies"" gave us Bananarama's hit single ""I Heard A Rumor,"" have I witnessed such divergence between the quality of a film and its signature song.I found ""God's Not Dead 2"" after hearing an incredibly uplifting, belongs-in-a-credit-card-commercial song from this film called ""Silence You"" by (Sarah) Hayley Orrantia, better known as Erica ""Chuck Cunningham"" Goldberg on The Goldbergs (Erica, like Chuck from Happy Days, is the nonexistent daughter of the Goldbergs, who had three sons), an actress I've enjoyed watching since that show debuted in 2013. Like The Goldbergs, however, one of the most raw-talented actresses of this generation has been abandoned much like Jesus himself on the cross, left to play against some of the worst ""talent"" Hollywood has ever employed on a continual basis. The film amounts to little more than a glorified acting class for Ms. Orrantia, whom Hollywood has yet to provide with a vehicle even remotely capable of highlighting her nearly-infinite acting capabilities. As for the remainder of the cast, I'll do my best to adhere to the Christian principle of not saying anything about someone if I can't say something nice, to the extent possible.Pat Boone, six decades removed from his reformed-badboy turn in 1957's ""April Love"" (another atrocious film but for another singing female star, Shirley Jones) should have channeled George Burns from Oh! God, and played Jesus himself in the court scene, as this would have been more believable to me, since I had not realized he was even still alive. Rather than put Christianity itself on trial, as in the film, I'd be more inclined to indict Ms. Orrantia's ""people"" for encouraging her to lend her name to this abomination. Thankfully, she is seventh-billed, which minimizes any fallout towards her career, though what is easily the best song she has ever recorded has been ""Silenced"" from mainstream radio by its association with this ""Crybully"" religious propaganda, which attempts to portray America's majority religion as persecuted, as if 2016 America were Ancient Rome. The premise is simply ludicrous. The remainder of the cast includes two of my least-favorite relics from ABC's sitcom past, Melissa Joan Hart and Robin Givens, the latter of whom seems to have made a wrong turn on the way to a Satanic thriller in her long journey from the divorce court where she ended her marriage to Mike Tyson; talk about playing against type. Jesse Metcalfe, fresh off his turn in ruining another rebooted 1980s show, Dallas, also lands here. Kurt Vonnegut's advisory to pity the audience was clearly lost on the producers, who clearly could have benefited from a religious studies course which explored things like First Cause (how do you get something from nothing), or the many scientific bases upon which the ""defense"" of Jesus could have been based, such as how we are born ""knowing"" things via our DNA, which was obviously created in that other world inhabited by God and His Only Son. Rather than defend Jesus, questioning the wisdom of scientists who stop at the point of creation with highfalutin' technical terms like ""Big"" and ""Bang,"" is ripe for a big-screen treatment, but, like better chess moves, were simply not played on this board. My personal favorite rebuttal to any disbelievers, Christian or otherwise, comes from a billboard I once found while living in Albany, GA in 2000 (my dad was from Cedartown, GA): ""God doesn't question YOUR existence."" Instead, we get the same tired, science-averse Chrisitan preaching which makes films like this not only forgettable, but painful to watch. The film's defense of destroying the wall between church and state is also short-sighted, given the abuses by all religions which would result. God is kept out of our schools for a very good reason. The proselytizing of the film renders moot the religion-as-academic-topic exception to the Establishment Clause. Finally, as a former paralegal, I'll say only that the legal scenes were in dire need of a script doctor.I definitely feltsomething watching this film, but that something was nausea, particularly when I realized that it was what literally impaled Silence You on the mainstream radio stake. It is clear that Ms. Orrantia is a devout Christian, not from her acting, but her literally inspired singing, which far exceeds her previous musical range. Indeed, the voice she laid onto that song is more compelling evidence of divine existence than everything else in the film put together. That the larger radio stations have ignored this song because it diverts from their secular message is a pox on their house, given the pollution of today's music by no-talents. Two listens is all it took for me to place Silence You atop my YouTube Playlist. The song – which can be taken to heart by Christians and non-Christians alike -- is THAT good, but because it is attached to a film which is THAT bad, most of the world will never get to hear it. Ms. Orrantia is a great talent in both singing and acting who will one day shine. The remainder of the cast is the opposite, who hopefully will one day be doing whatever unemployed actors do once their Hollywood run has ended. Were this film a final exam at Julliard, she'd be given an A, as she made the most of what limited opportunity she was provided, but someone with the comedic timing, nuance, and range she has repeatedly displayed on The Goldbergs deserved better than to be buried underneath ""stars"" whose careers should have ended twenty years ago. Hopefully, she will one day make a film where the abilities of those surrounding her match or exceed her own. This film certainly wasn't it.Ray Gordon"
" Like the first one wasn't bad enough...
",2017-10-04 00:00:00,1,"You know what's worse than a preachy movie that preaches to the already converted? A preachy movie that deliberately paints the opposition in a bad light to sell their narrative.The first God's Not Dead was a stupid movie about a atheist strawman disguised as a philosophy professor. There was nothing there of merit and it was only there as an echo chamber for those that believed as the movie makers did. This one however takes the persecution a step further into an America that never actually existed.Melissa Joan Hart plays a teacher who one day mentions Jesus in a historical context while in class. For this she's sanctioned, everybody loses their minds and the evil ACLU steps in to prosecute her. The fact that they got Ray Wise to play the lead prosecutor and had him play it as devilishly as possible I'm sure was just a stylistic choice and not a way of trying to paint the ACLU as a bunch of satanists. If you've actually checked the facts you'd see that the ACLU has actually defended Christians when their rights were trampled upon. But that's not good story telling for these people so they leave that out and hope you don't check.What follows is a standard courtroom drama which should never have gone as far as it did in the first place. There's no statute or law that states that you can't mention the name of Jesus in a classroom. What you can't do is read from a bible or teach Christianity unless the class calls for it like in a comparative religion class.There's also a subplot where Pastor Dave from the previous movie is on the jury and later on is taken into custody for not providing the transcripts for his sermons. This is the plot for the upcoming ""God's Not Dead 3"". Again this isn't a bad thing as it's there to make sure churches don't lose their tax exempt status by promoting a political candidate which they're not supposed to do. In the end it's a predictable movie with a predictable ending that will have the Christians feeling good and everybody else wondering why they wasted money on this."
" Dishonest Christian self-victimization
",2017-09-30 00:00:00,1,"As someone wrote on their review tittle: Christian paranoia, at best. I'll keep it simple and short: there is not a single shred of evidence for any gods of any religion, it's common mental construct as 1 of the infinite hypothesis over creation/formation of the Universe, for which further elaboration you realize it's false, having said this I, as many fellow atheists, advocate for free thought, speech and expression, since non-believers are often attacked as dishonestly as this movie, we appreciate and defend these Human Rights and our intellectual honesty easily let us extend it to religious people, so you have the right to believe your favorite or indoctrinated imaginary god, according to these Human Rights you have the Right To Be Wrong, and you are, as reality demonstrates.But this approach to Christianity from Christians is common, they,in general, believe they're victims before becoming Christians, and religion reinforce this even more with the guilt of ""being a sinner"", so I'm not surprised this is the outcome, proving 1 more time how delusional and away from reality not only Christians, but religious people really are, as it is their belief. These will bring even further bad consequences because of twisted perspectives, stubbornness (because of faith), jumping to conclusion and unrealistic expectations, that religious people incur because of their delusional wishful thinking.It is because of these reasons and consequences that being religious is simply wrong, and any reasonable person would see it once it is explained to them, but if you want to keep believing in believing in your god, you won't and keep being wrong with further negative consequences for your life, this movie is the tip of the tip of the iceberg; you don't pray a rocket into space, and you can get faith through Science, so don't mix religion and real-life, in the privacy of your home believe whatever you want, in real-life be realistic, at least this basic fact about life to avoid being a problem for others and yourself."
" Exceptionally well done, tense throughout
",2017-08-23 00:00:00,9,"I decided to see this movie after being powerfully impressed by ""The Case For Christ,"" reflecting that Melissa Joan Hart is at least a competent actress with substantial professional credits. Even so, I didn't expect much. I got much, much more than I expected.The movie's plot synthesizes a group of related cases involving militant anti-theists' (often led by the ACLU) attempts to pillory Christian teachers who dared to mention the name of Jesus or parts of the New Testament in a classroom setting. The dramatization is exceptional: well paced, never far from the movie's central theme, and intensely human. The acting is competent throughout, as is the largely courtroom-focused cinematography.Of course anti-theists will revile the movie; it shows their agenda all too clearly: Drive God from the public square! But anyone who sincerely gives it a chance will reach a more positive conclusion."
" (Makes movie walks across town naked) Shame! Shame! Shame! Shame! (5x)
",2017-08-14 00:00:00,1,"Clarissa didn't explain it all. Or if she did, I must have missed it this time. Frankly, Clarissa's pet alligator Elvis could've made a more coherent thing.Oh hey, c'mon, clearly these Christians in America are so persecuted! Thats why there are thousands of them at the end/at that concert yelling God's Not Dead. Makes sense, don't it? It clearly took a lot for a 2016 movie to be more offensive, idiotic, wrong-headed, and not comprehending on the most rudimentary of levels how ANYTHING WORKS than Collateral Beauty... This went the distance. God's Not Dead 2 is at best pathetic and confused about the message it wants to convey. At worst, it paints a dangerous picture about how people, who may be ignorant or not know any better, may/will perceive how things work like the *constitution of the United States* and the courts and is not at ALL how it works. Ray Wise and Ernie Hudson, please tell me you donated your salaries to the ACLU and/or Planned Parenthood, otherwise what the in the unholy (Bleep) are you DOING in this? Does Leland Palmer have more Garmonbozia he owes to the Black Lodge??This should anger reasonable-minded Christians as if not more than agnostics or atheists or like you know ANY SINGLE OTHER RELIGION - this makes you look like insecure maniacs. Aside from this - like the first one didn't understand how things like college works - it uses its position to constantly play the victim card. I am (NOT) sorry, but the fact that you can pull together millions of dollars (even if it's only a million, since this is so cheaply made aa these all are) to make something like a motion picture with actors and a crew is proof enough that you are not in a minority position. You just aren't.Bleep times a hundred. Even the production quality makes made-for- Hallmark pap look like Alfonso Cuaron. I don't have the energy to write a longer review for now...Wait, I'm not done, one last thing - I'm an English teacher at a community college where the student populous is largely if not all Christian. I've taught Letter From a Birmingham Jail many times. Shame on this bland hunk of nightmare fuel for bringing that into this propo."

First it takes place in Arkansas which legal age is 16 and Brooke is 16 so go figure. 2)I am not saying teachers shouldn't talk about God in school but the donations part is illegal i believe. 3)This film is just pushing Christianity and trying to shove it down people's throats. Let people choose their path. 4)Not everyone involved in a case like.this will be evil and try to destroy you with their mind.

" Sad
",2017-04-07 00:00:00,4,"I've said before that I like the first God's Not Dead. Sadly, I don't think the sequel did as well as the first movie. I admire them trying to tackle the issue of whether or not talking about Jesus as a historical figure (not as a religious figure) is okay in a school; it's legitimately a tough issue. However, where the first one was able to talk about whether or not God was dead or not, this one feels pointless in many ways.1) First of all, the title is called God's Not Dead 2, and the plot doesn't really deal with that situation. It feels like an excuse to promote the Newsboys. Even the returning cast members add little to nothing to the plot, or really help the main character that much. One of them has to be on the jury, but then he's too sick to help so someone new has to step in. What was the purpose of any of them being in there? Also, with it being called ""God's Not Dead 2"" it doesn't deal with whether or not He's really dead; it's only bringing up whether or not Jesus should be mentioned in class or not. Why couldn't it be called ""God is Good"" since they use that phrase a lot more than they do ""God's Not Dead"". 2) Most of the Atheists: I'm a Christian, and even I know Atheists don't talk like Disney villains. Apart from the lawyer helping the main character (he was an interesting character), all the other Atheists are portrayed as cold, cruel, heartless, and just looking to destroy God's name in court and literally say that it will be the final proof ""that God is dead."" That was not the goal of the court; the goal was to discuss whether or not Jesus should be mentioned as a historical figure, this has nothing to do with God being dead or not. It really felt like the screen writer did not know how Atheists think and wanted the audience to only sympathize with the main character. Okay, but if we have to sympathize with her, don't make real people act like cartoon bad guys; that's part of good story telling. I still really admire the movie's attempt to debate whether or not Jesus should be talked about at school as a historical figure, because it is a tough issue. Even if you don't think Jesus was the Son of God, He is classified in the history books as a rabbi who taught love in a dark time and paid for it. However, I really wish this movie did not have two dimensional villains or pointlessly use the same title as last time. In terms of Christian films, this was definitely one of the weaker ones, and I hope in the future they can obtain better writers."
" Killing Jesus Is A Victimless Crime
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,4,"Before I start I'd just like to say that despite being a rabid anti-theist I have met Christians who are decent people. I've also met a lot of vile atheists . I should also point out that as a traveller abroad I am treated like a king in Indo-Aryan lands in general and Islamic Indo-Aryan lands in particular with the hospitality of both the Kashmiris and the Kurds something that will linger in my memory forever . What I'm trying to say is that if someone is a thoroughly good person this has nothing to do with a belief in a creator while someone who is a bad person and has no belief the two things are completely unconnected. That said if someone crashes an airliner into a crowded building on purpose a belief system involving an afterlife might very well be the prime motive. Regardless the vast majority of believers are not violent terrorists . I feel the need to point this out because GND 2 doesn't feel the need to be objective. Nor does feel the need to be factual in anyway !!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!! Teacher Grace Wesley answers a question in class about and because the American constitution separates church and state she finds herself in bother. Actually separation of church and state is one of the very few things the film gets right because America was the first country to do this and is based on the philosophy of Thomas Paine. What is unlikely if not entirely impossible is Grace finding herself in a court of law facing trial . Did witch trials not die out over two hundred years ago ? Yes apart from the McCarthy trials which were directed against suspected communists but the film makes clear it's not communists or any other type of atheist being prosecuted here The chief villain is the prosecuting attorney who is called Kane which indicates he's of Irish descent but might this not be Europeanised from the name ""Cain"" ? I think you know what's being implied here and it's not helped by Kane's main motive apart from deicide is making money. I know the film needs a motive for bringing a protagonist to court but couldn't it have been more sensible without appearing racist in anyway? This is what becomes somewhat unpalatable. The first film has an antagonist trying to effectively ""Kill God"". In the sequel the antagonist is trying to effectively ""Kill Jesus"". I don't have to point out that for the last two thousand years the cult of Christianity has pointed the finger very firmly at a certain race who they feel is responsible for this mythical act against a mythical figure. Millions were murdered because of it and many millions more persecuted because of it. Unlike Biblical myth this is established historical fact What the main argument of the film rests on is ""Was Jesus Christ a real person ?"" Christian apologist Lee Strobel playing himself is called to the witness stand and states amongst others ""Gerd Ludemann ... an atheist has written many historical accounts proving there was a Jesus"" Yes Ludemann is an atheist but he became an atheist after realising so called Biblical facts involving Jesus meant he could no longer believe in the concept of Christianity. His harassment by the established Protestant churches in Germany probably didn't help in his faith either. The second witness is Jim Warner Wallace another real life Christian apologist plays himself and his testimony is taken as Gospel (Geddit ?)because he used to be an atheist but became a Christian because his experience of cold case homicide cases led him to believe there was a real life person called Jesus Let me get this straight ? If there was a person called Jesus Christ living in Bronze Age Palestine that means there is a God ? And if the claim is made by atheists that makes it even more overwhelming as a fact ? Strange how Professor Richard Dawkins often talks of Jesus Christ as though he was a real life person but he still remains the world's most prominent anti-theist . That's because even if he did exist Jesus Christ could be anything from a charlatan who had set up his own fan club that got out of hand to someone suffering from acute psychotic delusion. Being the Son of God is the least likely scenario . Oh and since we're supposed to take the word of atheists who used to believe in God quite strongly why not quote Josef Stalin who trained to be an Orthodox priest ? As you can imagine this movie has a happy ending as Kane/Cain stumbles out of court with his understudies bitter recriminations echoing that ""At least you proved the existence of Jesus"". One can imagine the defendants at the Nuremberg war crimes trial wishing this guy had prosecuted them"
" I loved this movie
",2017-02-26 00:00:00,10,"I am a Christian and I just loved this movie. Then I look at some of the reviews of some of the people who blasted this movie.If this movie isn't your cup of tea don't watch it. I really hate all of the movies about ghosts, zombies, and ultra violent movies. I won't watch them just so I can chime in how much I dislike them.I loved it, and there are so few movies that are suitable for a Christian to watch now. If you don't think there is persecution in America then you better look around. People are being sued because they refuse to supply cakes or flowers to gay wedding. I do wonder what would happen if there was a church, that was against gay marriage, that wanted some literature printed up by a gay couple, and they refused.The 10 Commandments are being removed from Government buildings. I have had arguments with atheists and some of them do get angry about my stance as a Christian.Is this movie 100% believable, no not really, but take a look at Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, Star Wars, James Bond movies, and see just how believable they are."
" The sequel that nobody wanted.
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,1,"This cinematic failure is the sequel to everyone's favorite movie gods not dead. The plot is somehow worse than gods not dead, where now its a teacher who mentions Jesus LEGALLY in a class and gets in trouble with the school board. it would be a civil court but since everybody is atheist it goes to criminal court violating the simple concept of the court system. With the ""evil"" ACLU on the school boards side, the lawyer resorts to making the court say Christianity is the only religion. after getting people to say Jesus existed and a blind rant on how rights can't be subordinate to other rights ( the right of safety is greater than the right to make money) the good teacher wins! This movie is among the worst Pure Flix has made. And somebody thought it was a good idea to give this film another sequel! Don't watch this pile of trash"
" Finally, a Christian movie worth watching
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,10,"God's Not Dead 2 is a great movie. Well acted and written, it is engaging and a fun watch with plenty of surprises. I'm not one who gets excited about Christian movies, but this movie is worth being enthusiastic about! Grace, the school teacher, and her union-appointed lawyer fresh out of school,Tom, must face the challenge of defending Grace's honest response to a student's question. Other smaller story lines provide additional interest. Although I enjoyed the first movie, the second is quite a bit more interesting. In addition to being thought provoking, it is gripping. I'm hoping to see Tom Endler, played by Jesse Metcalfe, in the next movie."
" Compelling Drama
",2017-01-02 00:00:00,9,"In one of those rare instances where a sequel outperforms its predecessor, God's Not Dead 2 shines as a film that should extend to non Christian audiences. Overall the plot with intersecting individual story lines, of a teacher being subjected to censure and potential loss of her career as a consequence of quoting Jesus in her Public High school History class, proves to be a strong cinematic piece highlighted by compelling and edgy court room drama. Scenes with Lee Strobel, J. Warner Wallace, and Melissa Joan Hart on the stand are reminiscent of devastating verdict breaking testimony in films like ""The Verdict"" (1982), ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ('62), and ""aFew Good Men"" ('92). OK, unlike ""A Few Good Men"", a witness for the prosecution does not blurt out it admits Jesus is God and Savior, but it's still stunning and devastating to the opposition, to hear the evidence that exists to support the Gospels."
" One great comedy out there
",2017-01-01 00:00:00,7,"Warning this review might contains spoilers.Please be advised During the plot there is an accusation into this teacher about preaching, all characters who are non-believers are described or depicted as evil, which is hilarious, how dramatic all characters are, they go from -teacher ""preached"" in classroom to -proving that Christian based faith ""Jesus Christ"" existed which is not the issue on trail, its just funny if you do not believe, if you do well I am sorry for the review. It is just too dramatic, this type of movies only bring out ignorance and misconception about educational system really is, education is about facts not about religion, this movie is just propaganda using the amendments in the constitution of free speech an so on, people just need to get over all this situation, at this point is just funny like I said before."
