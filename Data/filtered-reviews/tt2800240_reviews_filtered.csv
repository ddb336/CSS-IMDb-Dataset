" Another propaganda piece for French ppl
",2020-11-08 00:00:00,4,"Well, it's not bad to do métissage of white race when you present it in a funny way, doesn't?"
" Not worth watching at all
",2020-09-05 00:00:00,2,"I will never, ever, understand how some people perceive this kind of stupidity as funny.
It's beyond me.
A definite no."
" Shallow and just not funny
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,2,"This movie is one of the shallowest I have seen in a long while. It is completely predictable, it pretends to play with clichés while just reproducing them, and it does so in mostly unfunny ways. It is not worth your time!"
" Another great family comedy... in French!
",2020-08-19 00:00:00,8,"Le Petite Nicolas, The Intouchables, The African Doctor.... French films are always able to imbue humour into family films about serious (social) issues. Living in an ethnically diverse country, this film definitely hits close to home. Each character represent the different viewpoint towards cross-cultural marriage today."
" I enjoyed it 7\10
",2020-05-09 00:00:00,7,"This film shows you all the disadvantages in france and all the small little details between the races and cultures in france. maybe some people won't find this movie funny and quite offensive but this is the whole point in the film, to show what are the differences between races, how no matter how much you live in a country people will remind you that you are from somewhere else and how a country like france is so devided. Don't get it wrong this is a comedy movie that jokes not on one race but all races, and doesn't cross the line. the actors are so funny and wonderful they add much more to the film. I really loved it."
" French Comedy
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,7,"I found this comedy really funny, I suggest to watch it in French."
" Poignant film with a comedic twist
",2020-04-02 00:00:00,8,"This film has an air of authenticity throughout. It brings forward so many of the situations together where we have experienced or seen casual racism, into the spotlight, and leads the viewer gently towards a solution.The chemistry between the brother-in-laws, and between the fathers is almost over the top in a immensely enjoyable way. The way life is lived, with a serene rhythm, and concerns other than monetary, stand out in contrast to popular cinema.What this film does best is shine as work of art. Nuances of culture, religion, race are captured, and sensitively. The storyline builds gradually working out the kinks until the viewer is enthusiastically rooting for a conclusion which seems more and more unlikely. The twist at the end is just a cherry on top.A truly great film with a great cast."
" Géniale film!

" Hilarious
",2019-08-25 00:00:00,10,"Tears from laughing.
Very good. Suggest to watch. 100/10"
" A movie worthy to watch
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,9,It was as good as the first movie! I definitely liked it!
" Fun to watch
",2019-03-09 00:00:00,7,"It's just what it should be, an entertaining family comedy movie. There might not be many surprising moments or turn of events during the film (It follows a simple and predictable storyline), but the laugh is definitely there. Watch it if you like to have a good laugh."
" Marvellously Politically Incorrect
",2018-11-12 00:00:00,7,"Lets take out everyday racism and examine it under the bright light of comedy!This very very funny film is a no holds barred look at bourgeois french culture, and multi-culture. I nearly peed my pants I laughed so hard. Totally worth your time whether you're french or not."
" Extremely rasist
",2018-11-06 00:00:00,1,"This movie is extremely rasist, I don't understand how people say it's not offensive. It shows that rasist situations are well accepted by targeted people. And they even try to avoid old rasist getting a shock by accepting black person into the family. Seriously, in what way this is funny??? If you say/show rasist things with humor it doesn't become less rasist. And these jokes are not even good. Wow."
" Hilarious movie...
",2018-03-21 00:00:00,7,"""Serial (Bad) Weddings"" is a comedy movie in which we watch a Catholic French couple who have four daughters and three of those got married to men of different religion and origin. They are also a well-off, well-educated and well-thought couple but when they see their life going upside down because of their sons-in-law cannot handle it. So, their hopes lay on their last fourth daughter who tells them that she is going to marry a Catholic man and makes them very happy but this is the half truth and not all of it. I liked this movie very much because I believe it was simply hilarious. It has an interesting plot with some twists that will keep you alert but the most important advantage of this movie are the interpretations of the cast in combination with a very good direction. In addition to this, it has to be mentioned that the direction which was made by Philippe de Chauveron is simply amazing and with a very clever way of presenting many important and serious issues. I also liked very much the interpretations of the three sons-in-law (Frédéric Chau, Ary Abittan, and Medi Sadoun) who have a very good connection and the result is very funny. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Christian Clavier's who played the father of the girls (Claude Verneuil) and Chantal Lauby who played the mother of the girls (Marie Verneuil). The differences between the characters of the girls are something that in combination with the differences of the sons-in-law makes the movie more interesting and I believe that you are going to enjoy it very much since it's something very different and new.Lastly, I have to say that ""Serial (Bad) Weddings"" is a very good, interesting and funny movie. I believe that you aren't going to waste your time watching it. I strongly recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you are going to have a great time watching it since it's very interesting, with a well-written plot and a funny plot."
" predictable, too much kitsch, too much of everything
",2018-03-12 00:00:00,2,"The jokes sometimes were fun, but in general very predictable. Also everything had to happen well aligned. The jew, the muslim, the chinese, the black guy one after each other with a predictable joke. Haha. Of course, this all had to end with a happy wedding in the church. No atheist, no lesbian daughter, no surprise you might expect in a french movie. Even kitschy snow at X-mas.Monsieur Claude was a big disappointment especially after seing a movie like Crustacés & coquillages (https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428430/)."
" Really bad
",2017-12-28 00:00:00,1,"Foolish, humorless,very bad acting,no real feeling, and at one point the sisters and their husbands do something horrible, seemingly totally out of character, but life goes on...Also our young couple reacts to problems in ways that make no sense..."
" french comedy with a sparkle of love
",2017-11-14 00:00:00,9,"This is a french comedy which scored 3 million admissions in just ten days from the writer and director Philippe DE Chauvernon.The Catholic French parents Verneuil have four daughters that marry man of different origins and religions:an Arab,a Jew and an Asian,leaving the youngest daughter,Laure to have another fortune.Soon after all the weddings,Laure introduces her fiancé Who is a Catholic yes,but he is also black.In that moment her father feels like his World is falling apart.But when her parents meet Charle s parents they get along really good.One day both Fathers go fishing and then they go to a restaurant5 where they get drunk and arrested.Laure becomes really visibly angry and refuses to marry Charles anymore.their parents try to convince her and in the end they have a beautiful wedding.The witty satire is an aspect that makes this movie riveting.Although this movie had received lots of positive reviews.I think it is a little underrated,mainly in USA.The only minor problem in this movie is the far-fetching racism ,t this film brings the smiles on our faces and really,what would you do without a little french satire?"
