" If you love churches
",2021-03-31 00:00:00,3,"This was just painful, and a waste of such a talented cast. We had to endure that church for 25% of the movie. It means nothing to me, they could have burned and finished the movie in an outhouse as far as I'm concerned. The thing that got me laugh though was the all powerful ""gatling"" which obviously could destroy a whole village. I mean come on, if the bad guys had brought a couple of cannons......... With a ""gatling"" from that time and from that distance,,,,,,, keep your head down and you'll be fine. It's not a WMD. A Spencer rifle would have taken out the ""gatling"" operator easily."
" A good remake of a dying genre
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,8,"I really like this film and I will say the positives,and negativesThe positives
The performance of the cast are great especially Denzel Washington, and Chris Pratt.The action sequences are great.The direction of Antoine Fuqua is good.The score of James horner is great and the highlight of the film.The negatives
The screenplay and story is okay ish but not outstanding.Overall I recommend this movie for those who loves westerns."
" A fun remake
",2021-03-10 00:00:00,10,"I am a big fan of westerns and this film is right up my alley. I love all the actors in this film, the story was a fun thrill ride, and the action was top notch. If you love action, I definitely recommend you give this film a watch."
" Incredible!
",2021-03-01 00:00:00,10,Another great movie by Antoine Fuqua! Definitely one of my all time favourite movies now! Incredible cast and performance by everyone! non stop entertainment.
" You want bullets, we got bullets
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,10,"Antoine Fuqua's The Magnificent Seven was pure adrenaline rush western starring Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke who also starred in 2001's Training Day also done by Antoine Fuqua. It was entertaining as hell and packed one hell of a punch. Not every Movie does that but this one is the one. This movie needs no introduction cause it's just that damn good. Anything with Denzel Washington is good, period. Cause he's just that good. Gotta give all involved credit. Outstanding work.10 for this one."
" Another Denzel W dud film
",2021-01-24 00:00:00,2,"Like someone said already Liam Neeson and Mr Washington should start getting real and acting their age!!! Hopeless!
He's gotten so boring and only goes into character as himself. Like Tom Cruise etc.And this is no comparison to the original! Stop screwing up the originals Hollywood! WtfLet them rest in perfect peace For God sakes"
" Empty
",2020-12-31 00:00:00,1,Don't waste your time. That's it. That's the review.
" Shouldn't have bothered...
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,5,"The original had a great ensemble cast, great action, outstanding musical score and delivered.
This remake was much anticipated yet failed to deliver.
The direction is piss poor. Its got absolutely no feel of the West and everything feels like a cheap sound stage.
John Huston this is not.
Then there is the lack of characterisation.
I just wasn't invested in anyone.
Yul Brynners Chris had a real feel to him, his motley crew were diverse bunch of mercenaries, criminals, fear driven gunslinger, bad, good, greedy, young and hot headed.
This lot by comparison were 2 dimensional.
I honestly felt cheated by the fact they chose one fight scene.
In the original the group are betrayed after winning the first battle.
The entire theme is the fact the 7 became magnificent by returning to do battle, when the townsfolk had bottled it.
They chose to fight the lost cause.
Something that is a recurring theme in many a great Western.
This is not a great Western.
It feels cheap, badly directed and badly edited.
Very dissapointing."
" Don't watch because of the original
",2020-12-02 00:00:00,9,I don't care what everyone says. It's a very fun movie and I really like. I've seen it maybe a dozen times and I love it every time. Just watch it for itself and not the original.
" The Other Seven
",2020-11-16 00:00:00,4,If you rate this movie above 4 stars you obviously haven't watched the original.
" Evolving...
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,8,"I am falling in love with modern Westerns, always with an acid humor, evolving irony, shots, machismo brucutus, and the reaffirmation that white, ambitious and intolerant men decimated the Indians, as here, the contagious history, despite the countless characters, and yet each in their own way, all very charismatic, long without being tedious, despite not being a fan of the action scenes, with bullets flying around everywhere, which could be reduced by one cadim ..."
" The great but not Magnificent Seven
",2020-10-25 00:00:00,8,"Going on to this I had very high hopes, Chris Pratt, Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke and Haley Bennet are all big stars. Acting wise I can't fault this film, a bit stale in some places and with little chemistry but overall very impressive.Action wise is where it peaks, what fantastic practical effects this had. I was almost surprised when watching the special features on the DVD at how much of the stunts all the actors did, very impressive that's for sure! The gunfights were exciting and shot in such a good way that you understood what was happening too. The sets were very authentic and obviously a lot of effort was gone into making them.The villain was pretty good (although I didn't quite get his motive) but no where near as magnificent as the great Eli Wallach in the original. He was suitably slimy whilst being a formidable gunfighter though.8/10: A remake that's worth a watch, not as good as the original but stands well enough in its own right, Denzel Washington is brilliant and the music was surprisingly epic. An underrated film"
" Bland and ridiculous.
",2020-10-16 00:00:00,3,"""The Magnificent Seven"" is a film filled with unmotivated characters and unenthusiastic writing simply because it depends on It's action to pick up the movie. Yet, It's action is so over the top and unrealistic, you can't help but watch in awe at It's absurdity."
" Pffffffffffffft
",2020-10-08 00:00:00,5,"So for some reason this was my university course's choice for the western genre, and the only reason I can think of for that is that there was a part of the lecture saying that the western is an archetypal genre that will never die out, and this is a modern film, which proves that point I guess?They could have chosen The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. They could have chosen Stagecoach. If they wanted a modern film they could have chosen The Ballad Of Buster Scruggs, or The Sisters Brothers. They could have even chosen the original Magnificent Seven, which at least had a purpose for existing in a time where Seven Samurai probably wasn't widely available in the West. All of them would be more fitting, most of them I haven't seen yet, and all of them are things I would rather have watched.But instead we've got something that I think is trying to beat The Wretched for inspiring the least amount of things I can say about it.I'm sure everyone knows by now that the original film was basically just an unofficial remake of Seven Samurai, which, like I said, was at least justifiable in 1960, when I can't imagine Japanese films were easy to find in the West, but in 2016 and beyond you can have it at home on your computer in five minutes, and this film does a grand total of nothing to differentiate itself from it.And much like The Wretched, everything about it is fine. The acting, the cinematography, the characters, the writing, the directing, it's all just...fine. In short, there's no reason for it to exist at all, even if the original Magnificent Seven wasn't already basically a remake, it wouldn't justify itself, but when Seven Samurai exists as well, it's a film that only exists to take up space.And make money, of course. Lots and lots of money. Which it did.*sigh*"
" Can't take my eyes offa you!
",2020-10-01 00:00:00,6,"I know this film is based in the US Wild West, but why can't I take my eyes off Lee Byung Ho as Billy Rocks? How about taking one or two Americans back to Asia for a return movie? Don't have to learn the language."
" A mediocre western trying to score off a masterpiece
",2020-09-24 00:00:00,5,"The cast is excellent, the film could have been an ok western but they decided instead to try and make it a remake of a masterpiece. This was the worst plan, resulting in a film which , inevitably, is contrasted unfavourably with the original.Don't bother with this waste of screen time, watch the original."
" Pretty Good Watch
",2020-09-23 00:00:00,8,I wish Quentin Tarantino would've directed this. I'm getting Hateful 8/Django vibes from it.
" Magnificent!
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,10,"I loved the 1860's version, and this one is even better!"
" Major qualification on this movie's 7 rating.
",2020-09-14 00:00:00,8,"If this movie had not depended upon the title of a true classic - the original Yul Brenner Mag7, it would have stood tall in its own right. Denzil Washington is a great actor and this is a good movie that didn't need the coat tails of the first one.Why? Is because the town, which needed some help was not in such peril as the town south of the border. Also the actors in this movie while good did not have the power as all of the first seven. Only three of the seven were at the level of all the seven.The evil 'industrialist' was barely evil enough. Every part of this movie is scaled way up. If it had been made as its own story there was enough different to spare the comparisons. I'll avoid specifics to avoid spoilers.It's a great movie but not as a remake in our opinion. Denzil, Galaxy Defender, and Bug Man from MIB we're fabulous."
" Pretty Bad
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,4,This should have been the Ridiculous one. (In reference to The Ridiculous Six)
" Great movie and portrayal of western classic
",2020-09-06 00:00:00,10,"The 2016 Magnificent Seven is a great film. And, it has great direction of an old classic into a new different kind of movie. Actually didn't like the old 1960 Magnificent Seven too much, but I loved this movie and especially loved all 7 hero characters, wonderful handsome actors, every last one of them. Honestly can't say which gentleman was my favorite because I fell in love with all 7 heros. The actress was great too at portraying the damsel in distress. Even the actor portraying the bad guy was great. Great entertainment and great fun watching it."
" Watchable yet forgettable fun actioneer
",2020-08-26 00:00:00,5,"Lots of great action and a few laughs. Even an attempt to reproduce some Sergio-Leone-esque gunfight tension.The real let-down in this film is that they never manage to create any genuine feelings towards the character's - all are a little two-dimensional, barring perhaps Jack Horne. Shame, because the whole climax relies on the audience caring.This film will kill two and a half hours, but I doubt you'd ever go back to it."
" Still enjoyable
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,8,"I think this western film is quite good and very suitable for enjoying, not to think about. Indeed, there are many cliche touches that you usually find in other western films, but this film is still interesting for me personally, and I seem to ignore that cliche because I really enjoy this film, I really like it.This is a kind of film that is fast pace, especially in gathering the seven members. Character recognition and background are made as simple and concise as possible. However, entering the 2nd act or the last 45 minutes, I really felt an exciting journey from this story. All of the characters are very like-able and cool, with their own characteristics and personalities. Really interesting casting, making Denzel (a senior actor who is always cool in his role) as the leader, with a reunion with his charming hawk, and a successful pratt with his comedic-center, as well as the rest of the cast who are also stunning. Of course you can't expect more screentime balance and character depth, this is a risk with lots of good cast. The action scenes are very well-crafted and neat, and very jarring. Over all, its a good and enjoyable modern-western movie."
" Attempted Western revival delivers action over substance
",2020-08-16 00:00:00,6,"A valiant attempt at reviving the Western, that is well produced easy to watch cinema. The pace rattled along and the required gunslinging action was suitably tense, exciting and at times shocking (the film's opening sequence unequivocally setting a credible not comic tone). For me what Magnificent 7 lacked was much to make it magnificent. Character backstory was light with fairly thin context to motivate our heroes and drive the plot. I suspect this is simply a symptom of the genre, but in 2017 the average filmgoer expects a bit more than enigmatic saviours who both metaphorically and literally ride off into the sunset. Fuqua does balance some of the script's inadequacies with a superb cast with Washington and Pratt in particular naturally deepening their roles with their trademark gravitas and charisma. Enjoyable but I won't be jumping back in the saddle for another Western anytime soon."
" Another truly entertaining Western.
",2020-08-14 00:00:00,8,"Another Western movie that is full of entertainment. From the joking to the shooting all over the place, this movie is as joyful as it is action-packed. And to keep it going there are things happening you don't expect most of the time as well, which makes it even more interesting to keep watching to see what happens next. This surely keeps the entertaining going throughout the whole movie."
" The Lifetime Channel version of the legendary story
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,3,"Akira Kurosawa introduced us to ""Seven Samurai', one of the greatest films made.
John Sturges created the english story ""The MAgnificent Seven"" with Yule Brenner in the lead role, and maintained the legendary status of the original in a new country language and genre.
The basic story has been taken up in multiple genre's with varying degrees of success.Although there are several quite capable performers involved in this production, it becomes the 'Lifetime Channel' version of its glorious predecessors; relying on the reputation of the original Elmer Bernstein score to sell the feeling of the original western, regardless of what else we see and hear.Elememts of the rewritten story are just plain silly. Seminoles in Texas is just the first obvious sillyness. The dialog is mostly meaningless banter attempting to endear the characters to the vuewer without any real subtlety.Watchable if you ignore the attempt to claim the glory of its predecessors, and don't mind the bland character of the production and direction."
" Fantastic remake of a classic
",2020-07-19 00:00:00,9,"The magnificent seven remake boasts some o the best and most fun action I've seen in a while, actors that do a great job and have great chemistry, a villain that you want to punch in face, a great final battle, and some pretty funny moments. The only flaw is some characters are less developed than others which makes there deaths sometimes don't land. A great watch if you want a fun watch or a great modern western."
" Awesame movie
",2020-07-16 00:00:00,10,I completely love this movie. It's a nice western and you will love from the begining to the and the movie.
" Watchable remake, but lacking charm.
",2020-06-30 00:00:00,6,"The original 1960 THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN was one of the first westerns I ever saw, thanks to my grandfather, where Saturday afternoons as a kid I would sit there in the lounge room with him watching westerns, so it holds a special place in my heart. Hearing about the remake, I wasn't particularly interested, but over time my curiosity won out, especially with that ensemble cast led by Denzel Washington.While watchable, I found it to lack that sense of big time adventure (well Elmer Bernstein's powerful music score was a big part of that) and the effortless magnetism of the original film, however this efficient reboot (in the second half) delivers in spades the bravado confrontations, blaring shootouts and blazing self-sacrifice in the face of impossible odds. Action is expertly-staged, pacing stays upbeat and an earnestly well-oiled cast (with some standing out more than others) acquitting themselves by bringing few moments of emotional attachment, in spite of the shallow caricature arches and at times forced chemistry. At the core of the mechanical plot, the message and its themes remains the same, although I didn't really understand the need for the out-of-the-blue revenge angle towards the end. Nonetheless THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN is an admirable effort."
" I have tried three times to watch this!
",2020-06-27 00:00:00,1,"I have tried 3 times to watch this. It doesn't hold your attention. It lacks sparkle and bores. There is no brooding to a crescendo just nonsense macho violence, leading to the expected conclusion. Lacks any pathos and you don't identify with any of the victims"" plight. Not even an early massacre helps the audience feel sympathy. A poor film. We await for something better to replace the ""original"" Brynner epic. Perhaps the next one will have pace and a real zest within the script? Taking the music from Elmer Bernstein might help! Poor 1/10 as I wouldn't care if this had NEVER been made."
" WONDERFUL!!!!
",2020-06-17 00:00:00,10,"I never liked western movies. I thought they were boring and pointless.. UNTIL...I was forced to watch this one. I have seen it over 20 times. Denzel by far is one of the most amazing actors of all times. All the main actors in this movie were relevant. ""Fair Dave"" is my favorite one. Love everything about it including the message."
" Atrocious.
",2020-06-12 00:00:00,2,"First off, I get saying that ""well it's not the original so it sucks"" is an annoying trope, but it's true. The original, Akira Kurisowa's ""Seven Samurai,"" which is an amazing masterpiece of a movie. Was turned into a great modernized western, called the Magnificent Seven. However, this new reboot, was awful. Truly awful.
(I will compare this to Seven Samurai, for accuracy to the original.)
They removed the element of ""heroism"" by having payment. Seven samurai had hero's that were doing the job because they were selfless and honorable. The characters in this were just doing it for money and revenge and or they had nothing better to do.
The amazing depth of the scary villain is removed altogether, with some caricature bad guy businessman. The villains in seven samurai were just products of the world. They weren't humanized because they didn't need to be, they were a force of nature not a complex suffering bad guy. The new one, although explored a little bit more, is just bad. He feels to cartoonishly mean and villainy.
The main seven were barely explored, even the ones that were, were boring. In the original, each samurai had a reason to do what they were doing. In this, half of them just kinda come for giggles.
And to be honest, I wasn't against the race changes. I thought that the change in race actually could have benefited the characters due to it being set in the U.S. post civil war. However, they weren't explored enough and instead it just came off as PC pandering.
Worst of all is the main character. Denzel Washington is playing a poor man's Django. Rough riding the west, killing evil white men and giving justice where need be. Too bad his character is greedy and vengeful. The original character (Kambei) was removed from the equation. He had no personal stake in the village, nor the bad guy. He was simply a selfless man, doing it because it was right. Denzel's character was in it for two reasons, money and revenge. This makes the idea of selfless heroism, the core concept, seem thrown out and wasted. Had they not done this and instead followed original suit, the character would have been seen a magnificent and just. Instead he's just angry.The movie was an awful, PC, hollow, cash grabbing, remake from a hollow company. Don't watch, go and Watch ""Seven Samurai"" or ""The Magnificent Seven (1960)."""
" If you want a master piece, watch the original
",2020-06-08 00:00:00,7,"Most of the bad reviews are coze its been compared to the original one. But if u forget about it and lay back, its a good movie with great acting. My favorite is always Ethan Hawke. Of course whats missing is some really good music but hey, we heard worse, right"
" Very Well Remade
",2020-06-05 00:00:00,8,"It's a big call to remake a classic western like the 1960 The Magnificent Seven but director Antoine Fuqua has succeeded nicely.
Its characters maybe not as close to the original cast but they do a good job.
In it's own right its one of the best westerns in the last few years and as good as remake as 2010's True Grit.
Great sets, nice acting and a nicely paced plot.
Theres plenty of action mixed in, maybe as a criticism a little too much in the later stages of the movie.
If you love a good western definitely dont miss this one."
" No Surprises Here
",2020-05-01 00:00:00,5,"Being a fan of other interpretations of this tale, I expected more. All by the numbers and I don't think the good guys fired a shot during battle that ever missed it's target. And what's with bad guys always jumping out into the open to get shot? OK, to pass the time but a wasted opportunity with no originality or vision."
" magnificent seven
",2020-04-24 00:00:00,7,"Maybe magnificent seven 2016 isnt close to be as good as original western but compared to many remakes and reboots of previous years,i must say that this film puts a dose of respect on its name and legacy,maybe that is becase fuqua give a very good direction and actors expecely denzel all give very enterteining performances ,cast and characters from 60s film is maybe more memorable and iconic but younger stars in this film proved that they can act,magnificent seven was a enterteining western and even if it is nothing new in genre it still took some old staff and put it in a modern world with a respect to source material and reminder that westerns arent dead yet"
" Ignore the haters!!!
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,9,Never seen the original but that doesn't matter. This film had me gripped from start to finish. Some great acting and female support lead that you can feel the same emotion as. Amazing film. The final scene is superb. You gotta watch this film. I'm not a internet warrior like most these people. If they think that can make a better film. Why havnt they?
" I thought that was absolutely class
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,9,"I personally love western films and this was one of my favourites. I'm way to young to have seen the original and all the bad reviews are complaining that it's nothing like the original and it's really frustrating because I don't need to see the original to know this was better then the 1960 film, people need to get their head out of their Arses. I thought that was incredible and fully deserves a 9/10, fully recommended if you like westerns."
" Much better than people are saying
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,8,"I am going to jump straight in and say that I haven't watched the original to this. I went in with an intention of watching a typical western movie.I enjoyed it. The action scenes were absolutely fantastic and the final battle scenes were really intense and had me sat on the edge of my seat. My issues with this film was that the character development was poor. No backgrounds on any of the 7 people, and throughout the film I'd say you get to know about 3 of them at most. and ultimately that's what let's it down. But the plot and the action scenes for me personally save this film and I recommend watching if you enjoy westerns, but judging by the other reviews I suggest only watching if you haven't seen the original."
" A spectacle with little substance. Overshadowed by the original. ""Missed shot"" at an amazing team-up of such great cast
",2020-04-16 00:00:00,7,"Maybe it's because of the straight forward plot and forced quirky characterizations that this movie finds a way to not lend itself more room for development. To ground the world, the setting, the stakes and, mostly, the characters. Missing heart-to-heart moments and scenarios that showcase the reactions and personalities of the characters. We have seen western movies before and we can understand those themes and tropes, but what makes the greatest western movies stand out from the overly saturated genre are subverting our expectations of those conventionalities.Although following a formulaic structure, the westerns that seem to stand out from the rest critically (this coming from a 24 year-old who has barely scratched the surface of the genre and concludes this from analysing the most critically acclaimed titles) have either an engaging and unconventional plot or an endearing and well-realised cast. Aside from good practical effects, cinematography and soundtrack.In every western, when there are no duels, showdowns or action scenes, there're heart-to-heart moments where we see characters getting to know each other better, romances flourish and fears discussed that strengthen the ties between them. And especially when there's such an amazing cast of very different characters those moments are highly needed and have to be devoted to that in order for the audience to care for whatever happens to them in the story.The movie treats the audience with a spectacle of gunfire and staredowns and we relish them as they are good ol' western formulaic tropes that we never stop enjoying. But it seems like the movie is holding back on developing its characters and somewhat its plot. We have but almost one line of backstory for each and there's not enough going on in the movie to see them react to different scenarios and situations to find out their personalities.Not to mention the female lead, who's very underutilised. She initates the plan to take back the town and gathers the men to do so. And that would have been enough for her involvement in the story given the archetypes of western female characters but the movie goes out of its way to give her a feisty personality and a reason to fight but doesn't do almost anything with it. She is sidelined most of the times and when we get a character developing moment the scene cuts too soon to switch back to the plot.The huge cast of renowned actors prevented the deeper development of those characters but unforutantely the movie doesn't treat us with much of a complex or eventful story to stop us from wondering why weren't those moments there. And when the time comes to see these characters mourn a death, have a team-up badass moment or joke with each other it's good for the ride and the espectacle but it leaves no bigger mark.Nevertheless the movie has many good things going on for it, the entire third act is brilliantly executed, it's loud and exciting. It brings a sense of finality to the story like Avengers' Endgame did, only in this one we felt for those goodbye moments, jokes and team-up fights because we knew a lot about the characters and we have seen them grow and interact with each other through time and that's what I think this movie needed. It needed a trilogy or a prequel to set up the showdown. In this movie we see a grandiose battle, each of them fighting for their own reason but most of the time we don't know the reason. So their demise is not as impactful as it should.There are so many slow showdowns and duels that the end duel doesn't feel earned or that impactful not to mention the underdeveloped generic motivationless villain. I haven't seen the original 1960s movie but I've seen enough westerns to know from the premise of the movie the sort of beats and themes it must have followed and there are all there but they are just not maxed out.IN CONCLUSION, the movie is fun and exciting, is a parade of explosions, gun fights and good witty dialogue with very little depth to it and a script based solely in the interactions and superficial goals of each character in the story. It's fun to watch and doesn't make you think about it much, it's just plain fun."
" Disappointment
",2020-04-15 00:00:00,4,"The final shootout was just OK, but the rest was just boring.
I was hoping for more."
" Magnificent is a bit optimistic, maybe more modest....
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,7,"This is certainly a far cry from the original, but I think it has enough distinctive differences to merit not just being considered as a straight rip off. The bandits have been superseded by a greedy expansionist businessman; the prey are now ordinary working American citizens and the gang recruited to come to their aid a mix of the good, the bad, the ugly - and the funny. Denzel Washington is the Yul Brynner character and Ethan Hawke has shades of Robert Vaughn's character from the 1960 version, but otherwise the characterisations are largely different. The story to search for the seven takes an age - peppered with some rather mundane mini-plots that don't quite catch fire, and the overall pace of the film - aside from perhaps the last quite exciting 20 minutes, is pretty slow. Chris Pratt steals this as the charismatic ""Josh""; Byung-hun Lee has quite a bit of fun with his lethal bow and arrow and the dialogue is occasionally quite slick and pithy. As remakes go, it is perfectly watchable and although they certainly don't gel nearly as well as the original team, they still make for a decent enough updated western adventure."
" Magnificent?
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,5,"Soooooo much killing and gun fighting, I didn't have room for desert. Should be a 15. Not for me really but if you are into mindless violence, go for it!
Enjoy!"
" Many great actors with bad performances
",2020-04-10 00:00:00,6,Weak movie. But just for senseless watching with pizza is okay
" Why did they even try to remake a real classic?
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,1,One of the worst-ever remakes. This film is a complete and utter flop. To steal the title of a classic movie then spend millions of dollars and then produce such rubbish should be a criminal offence.
" Not really a interesting story
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,6,"The whole movie is about a lot of killing, something even more than people are around... don't count."
" Magnificent
",2020-03-30 00:00:00,9,"This film is great! Great cast ensemble, great story, phenomenal action sequences (although the finale is extremely hard to follow because it's too fast-paced. It was hard to tell who to root for because I couldn't tell the good guys from the bad guys because the cuts were too quick, and it didn't give my brain enough time to register what was happening.) and just an all-around great Western. Although the villain was kind of weak. He didn't give me chills, and I honestly didn't see him as much of a threat. That's more the fault of the writing, not the acting. The acting was fine. Chris Pratt is awesome as always, as are Denzel Washington, and the rest of the cast. The action sequences were great! If an action sequence (or the lead up to it) gets me excited, it's successful by my standards. This more than delivered on that. I was definitely restraining myself from cheering in the theater. (If I were alone, I definetly would have, though.)

" Very original remake
",2020-03-07 00:00:00,8,"This adaptation was true to the period. We see unshaven men, which was the norm in 1879. People looked and acted like you would expect from rural Americans of the time. The cast of characters comprising the seven were indeed a group of badass guys nobody would want to mess with. Denzel Washington was a commanding presence as their leader and Chris Pratt provided the charisma. D'Onoforio as the bearlike mountain man with the high pitched voice was unforgettable. Haley Bennett played her role with understated strength. They went up against a psychotic sociopathic mining mogul who did not know the meaning of mercy. The action scenes were marred by cheesy background music that seemed to have been piped in from the 1980s. The editing and direction was choppy and was mostly a distraction. Actors routinely muttered their lines and I gave up trying to decipher them. But the film was gritty, the characters more than one dimensional, and overall a very good western."
" The magnificent 7 with the values of 2016
",2020-03-02 00:00:00,5,"Watchable, a bit too long but totally forgettable. Casting Denzel Washington in a western as the lead character is totally and utterly preposterous.
I don't believe that a man like Denzel would be prancing around in 19th century America like he's a big man, a US marshal and commanding the respect of everyone around him. This then goes into science fiction category."
" The perfectly adequate seven
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,6,"Of all the modern westerns I've watched lately, this has definitely been the weakest. That sounds really harsh unfortunately, because this isn't bad, it's just good. It's not amazing or great or anything. Just good.Honestly, given the cast, just good kinda reinforces the notion that big ensemble often underwhelm. No one is bad here but it's all a little over the top for my liking. No one seems real. Maybe that's the idea but it just made this feel source generic.Still, it's fun and mindless. Good background fodder if nothing else."
" A Solid Western for Modern Times
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,8,"I enjoy the western genre but it is hard to find any good ones that have been made in more recent times (the last one being Silverado). This is a good one. It has all the classic things you'd expect in the genre: great riding, great action sequences, good vs evil, a climactic bang em up finish and a ride off into the sunset. The acting is well done and although I treated this film as a stand alone entertainment, if you feel you have to compare it to the original, I'd say it is better. Yes, the naysayers will go nuts with that, but the original classic is dated...in fact I would go so far as saying that each of the current actors did a much better job than the originals. Denzel Washington's steely eyed stares seethed with a heat that Yul Brynner did not. Personally I always though Yul looked stupid in westerns. As well, I never understood why the heck they cast Horst Buchholz in the original. The comanche they replaced his character with was awesome. Ethan Hawke nailed the role originally played by Robert Vaughan and had a much more imposing, yet disturbed demeanor. As far as the role Charles Bronson played, Vincent D'Onofrio (who I didn't even recognize under that makeup) played his role with great humor and equal if not better presence. The Asian actor who reprises the role played by James Coburn added a very slick martial arts action touch that Coburn was only so so at. All in all, given the time period the film is set in, this is the collection of the most abused and thus embittered people that you would expect to take on a suicide mission.
All that being said, the only thing missing to bring it over the top was that dynamite score from the original which I would have loved to hear throughout the film. After reading the other reviews, I wasn't sure if I'd like this rendition, but both my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Much of the comments from many of the negative reviewers seemed to have more to do with their own issues rather than the actual movie. To them, I say, relax...it's just an entertainment."
" Ignore the whiners!!...this movie is great!
",2020-02-19 00:00:00,9,"My Lord in Heaven at the comparisons! The original was ok, it was not the greatest movie ever. This movie is not the greatest movie ever, but gees...SO WHAT!!
It was a good movie and a good western. The action was great. The acting wasn't bad. It's a little over the top in some places. Everyone keeps referencing the Gatlin-Gun scene, but what the heck was you expecting in an action movie? If movie producers tried to make every action movie completely realistic, we'd have NO action movies worth a flip at all!
And then there's the whining about the political correct stuff...huh? I guess it's completely out of the realm of possibility that a black guy can be the lead man in a western? Does it somehow defy the laws of Physics that an oriental guy can be in a western movie and kill a bad guy with a knife instead of a gun?
Gees, people...get over yourselves and leave your little pacifier-sucking feelings out in the yard and watch the dang movie!
So, in short, ignore all the whining.....watch this movie. It's a good movie. It will not be the greatest movie of all time, but how many movies are? The cast is great and do a good job, especially Pratt and Washington. Haley Bennett is a great actress and is more than just good-looking eye candy in this movie. She plays a pretty good tortured soul, who just wants to save her town as well as avenge her husband who is shot down in cold blood.
The action and shooting and explosions are frequent and non-stop for the last hour, but again, it's an action movie and western, so that is ok.
Grab a plate of Chocolate chip cookies, sit down with the fam and enjoy."
" Great Actors, Slow Moving
",2020-02-10 00:00:00,7,"I love Denzel, Chris, and the rest of the cast. Stellar actors! Some funny lines. But the story itself, as the original, is slow to build. Good for a rainy afternoon."
" Politically correct cowboys
",2020-02-07 00:00:00,4,"Watched it because Byung-Hun Lee but i am gonna stick to his korean movies from on. It got asian, native american, mexican, irish, black dude and a courageous woman with a magnificent rack. They're gonna take down a capitalist warlord and save the people to carry on bounties to murder in a morally right way. Big budget but nothing new to see here, maybe one day hollywood make a movie about columbus and native americans to educate everyone globally in an entertaining way."
" It wasn't bad, it was pretty good actually.
",2020-01-07 00:00:00,6,"Maybe a 6.5/10. I felt at times though that it leaned a bit too much towards...how can I say this...being preachy. I felt, during just two or three scenes in the movie, like I was watching a movie that was trying to convert me to their beliefs. I will say no more than that as I don't want my review to be removed. So that made me a bit uncomfortable and definitely affected my ability to connect with the movie.
,
Now other than that though...it was a pretty good movie. Chris Pratt provided some good comedic relief. I felt like Denzel was a little under-utilized considering his great acting skills. However I suppose that was a kindness from him to the other actors; to not steal the spotlight for himself. There was some good acting and there were some fun action scenes. Interesting story.
.
Recommended, but only with the warning I included in my first paragraph. Your kids might want you to take them to a church after watching this."
" Whoever wrote this should be hit with a stick
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,1,"I watched this movie because it cost 3 dollars to download and it was a power outage. I went into the movie with the thought: this is gonna suck, but it will be mildly entertaining. That is to say, I did not set the bar high for Antoine Forqe's 'The Magnificent Seven.' Nevertheless, this movie was much worse than I expected. Seriously- if you came up with this, you should consider not sharing any of your ideas for a long time.Best,
Rich"
" I changed my rating to 1 star after rewatching the original!
",2019-12-01 00:00:00,1,"SPOILER ELERT! I watched this remake after not seeing the original for years. At first I gave the remake 5 stars but after watching the original again, there's no comparison and I lowered it to 1! The characters were way superior in the original and the remake story was so liberally as to have a totally unnecessary and disgusting Hollywood style church massacre. The romance angle in the original also blew the remake away. There is a lot missing in this remake that becomes apparent after watching the original."
" Spectacular, but lacking in story and characters
",2019-11-26 00:00:00,6,"As an inmatured Western, without anything to say, more than to be an excuse to show the action (not so different than tons of superhero movies), it works well and it is entertaining. That alone, puts it as a 6 points ""good"" (barely) movie. It works. It's fine.But it does lack depth. The characters joins the growing group without much of a motivation/reason. The cultural, social and racial differences of the extremely diverse cast, reduced to a handful of lines here and there, and not even used for jokes/funny situations between the characters. Finally, the story was the most simple and honestly boring type, with extremely defined roles of ""the good guys vs. the bad guys"".I hadn't seen the original, nor the truly original from Kurosawa, so my critic was not influenced by a the hate or love for them."
" IT CERTAINLY DESERVES MORE THAN A 6,9 !!!
",2019-11-22 00:00:00,10,"I didn't see it in 2016 but I saw the famous one when it came out back in the early sisxties...but then,I was just a little girl and couldn't grasp a lot.Love NETFLIX!!!Now that I am retired and live in a small coast city I don't go to the teather anymore but thanks to NETFLIX I've seen a lot of good stuff in so many different languages too,and that is a plus!
The Magnificent Seven 2016 certainly provided excellent entertainment!Loved it! The plot was there:dormant heroes to be awoken and to bring about havoc!!!
I found everything finely orchestrated and one by one of the participants of the odyssey did get their own reason for being there:they were doing nothing and there was money and action involved...Now,Denzel was just being Denzel.Reliable.Perfect.Ethan Hawk borrowed Val Kilmer's excelent Doc Holliday from Tombstone!!!Imediately recognised...but it fit ok.The Asian guy was in every gesture minimal and coherent...and fast! Vincent D'onofrio!!! Love the actor in every act and he also borrowed from Maury Chaykin,the adorable nuts in For A Less Ordinary Life,1996...Fantastic performance then by the deceased actor and by D'Onofrio...The Mexican,maybe had little exposure,and then Chris Pratt-so charismatic!!!! and we have the red skin boy.All westerns had to have indians,cowboys,saloons,and...a thug.Now we have to recognize the impressively splendid performance of Peter Sarsgaard,the thug.I hadn't seen him for some time and I found him a little bit too thin and now I know he loves to run,but it suited very well to the role.We had a man looking always mad,and under the influence lets say,opium or laudanum,much used those days...and he uttered his sayings in modulating his voice...Bravo Peter Sarsgaard! But hey,he is not the most evil criminal in movies at all!!!but I liked his performance!!!
I have never seen Mr.Kurosawa's Seven Samurais,from whch this one is inspired,but I have to confess that back in the 60's,his favorite actor was Toshiro Mifune and I was afraid of that one! Westerns were great back then and I wonder if The Duke wouldn't fit in the Denzel's/Brynner's role...of course he would!
The eternal,magic,forte,grand music track is immortalized and since the first key we know what is it...Gave 10.Couldn't give less!!!"
" Enjoyable; Good Cast; Falls Short on Theme
",2019-11-05 00:00:00,8,"Antoine Fuqua wanted to make a western, which is fine. He wanted to make the kind of western he enjoyed as a child, which is fine. And he wanted to re-adapt The Seven Samurai into a new western, which is fine.The problem is that the cinematic world has moved on since the 1970s and the issues that westerns need to engage are different now. If he wanted to make a great, enduring, important western, he'd need to understand the themes that more recent great westerns have engaged with that made them great: movies like Unforgiven, 3:10 to Yuma, Appaloosa, The Hateful Eight, The Revenant, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, and Django Unchained.With the cast and budget he had, Fuqua had a chance to put this film in league with those classics. As it is, though, without that depth of theme (or at least of relevant, contemporary theme) this movie will instead be remembered alongside Tombstone, The Mask of Zorro, and Quigley Down Under as fun, action-filled stories that don't actually contribute very much to the ongoing deconstruction of heroism, violence, family, liberty, and race that the aforementioned films have furthered so well.The cast deserve great kudos, including Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Peter Sarsgaard, and the ever-underrated Vincent D'Onofrio. It's unfortunate that the film doesn't do more with the diversity of its cast. There are female, Asian, Latino, and First Nations characters who aren't given any real depth at all. It even has the slightest hint of a male-male love relationship that could have been a powerful motivator for the two characters in question, who instead are given very little motivation for anything. Unfortunately, the non-black minority characters in the story are relegated to the background the way black characters once were.The performances, cinematography, and action sequences make this worth seeing, but it's not anywhere near as good or as important as it could have been. 8/10"
" Not a bad western
",2019-10-14 00:00:00,7,"I think it handicaps itself right from the start by being a remake. If they had just made a regular western and the director said that he was making an homage to some of the most iconic westerns, including the original seven, it might have been better received. It was a pretty good generic western and if you like the genre, you will like this movie."
" Violant,Emotional,Lesson-full
",2019-10-11 00:00:00,7,"This movie is a must-watch for those of movie buff around you, it has brilliant actors that made it irresistible not to watch.
High intensity of violence & bang-bang makes your eyeballs glued to the screen & pumps your blood twice faster.
Deeply watching, you can learn from it, it shows how love can bring Courage & bravery to oneself, it shows that sacrificing a life to save many others means Humanity & well-being and encourages us all to be a better human-being."
" I bet you my st""ick"" is bigger than your st""ick""
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,8,"It is a classic musical score, with an epic town battle between a small number of seven (7) lone gunfighters against a heavily stacked band of outlaws led by a wealthy land baron and you have the classic 1960's western. In this case it was released in 2016 and this western is definitely a throwback to a long gone western film era.Simply put, I really enjoyed it! A great western not soon to be forgotten."
" Only Chris Pratt is magnificent
",2019-09-30 00:00:00,6,"Magnificent seven story doesn't have anything new to offer because I had grown up watching several Indian movies with the same plot. Script is average, scenes are predictable. Another drawback is the antagonist was given less screentime. Among the lead, it's Chris Pratt who shines in performance and also in action. Despite being predictable the magnificent seven is a passable entertainer."
" Terrible Film
",2019-09-19 00:00:00,3,"This movie is absolute trash. There's barely any story outside the premises of the film and no character development or even a character setup on why each of the 7 men join the crew in the first place. There is no motivation given for anything the characters do and in the short scenes where the characters interact with one another is shallow. Because the movie failed to spend any time on developing the character, the audience was not invested emotionally in any of them when they died. I would've gave them one more star if the action sequences were done well but that wasn't done well either as the camera work is very chaotic moving from one scene to another instead of creating a sense of fluidity. Overall, it's a waste of 2 hours that I suggest you avoid. I gave it a chance thinking this might be an underappreciated movie but it is what it is which is a terrible film."
" Just enjoy the show
",2019-09-04 00:00:00,9,"Having watched it again and unfortunately read some reviews - never read negative reviews!!! So here I've put in my word. If you're one of these people who love to hate stuff, don't watch it, better still, don't tell us about it!
Now, don't think of it as a remake of the 'original' and just enjoy the ride.(So it's not original but no modern film is original - hey, everything has been done a thousand times so get over it!)
It's a modern Western with just a 12 rating so not too violent and very few profanities (which aren't needed anyway let's face it). Cast and character strength was fine, the build up was longwinded but needed, the action was great and I actually liked the fresh approach of characters, and by gees people - please stop moaning about it being politically correct (Hey?). I'm, let's say, not entirely PC but I actually enjoyed the mix of races and people - it made it feel like England! Hold onto your horses, and just enjoy the ride."
" Another for Remake Rubbish Tip
",2019-08-31 00:00:00,4,"Like most remakes a very poor offering, why must they take Brilliant Films and then change virtually the whole concept in a remake (not sure remake is correct title ) yet still try and cash in on Originals Name & Fame etc.
Here's a novel idea make remakes of Rubbish Films and try and improve concept And Not Brilliant Films Which the remakes dishonour."

" Good Cowboy Movie
",2019-08-15 00:00:00,8,"Antoine Fuqua and Denzel Washington are favorite director and actor.
No doubt they made this movie good. Everything is great except I hope Fuqua give more scenes for Ethan Hawke, he is one great actor too."
" One of the best movies I've ever seen!! Love it!!!

" Terrible
",2019-07-29 00:00:00,1,Compared to the original. Absolutely terrible. I couldn't even watch the whole thing.
" Bad, just Bad
",2019-07-25 00:00:00,4,"Washington and Fuqua have collaborated on some fine movies but this definitely isn't it. I could go into a lengthy comparison between this and the Sturgess classic but it just isn't worth it. What can be said is that this a film of no discernable value, the villain is a cardboard cut out, the gunfighters are laughable and their motivations ridiculous. The action sequences are hugely overdone and cannot by any stretch of the imagination be played in a western context.
If you enjoyed the Sturgess version don't watch this.
If you like westerns don't watch this.
If you liked Training Day and Equaliser don't watch this."
" my notes
",2019-07-23 00:00:00,5,Meh. it was ok. pretty boring until the finale. some great acting and cool actions scenes. i guess westerns aren't really my thing (1 viewing)
" ""We're simple farmers, decent hard-working people""
",2019-07-20 00:00:00,1,"One of the main questions raised by the making of a western today is how to bring forward yesterday's value systems into our times. Fuqua's update of the 1960 Magnificent Seven replaces the confused ethnic politics of John Sturges's film with an unimpeachable anti-racist message: where the post-war version made the plot hinge on a betrayal by unreliable Mexican peasants who are nevertheless rescued by self-sacrificing WASPs (a tacked-on theme with no parallel in the Kurosawa original), the new model takes pains to introduce a heroic black cowboy as 1) the target of ignorant prejudice, and 2) a better gunslinger than anybody else. This virtue-signaling may sadly still be useful today, but the point has already been made with more imagination, from Blazing Saddles (Mel Brookes, 1974) to Posse (Mario van Peebles, 1993). An Asian-American, a Hispanic and a Native American are addeed to the mix, and a Woman is also allowed to join the band (although she's put back in her place once the battle is over), so the bases are pretty well covered... On the other hand, our heroes also include a Confederate (great pals with the black team-leader!), while the bad guys also have an Indian (named ""Denali"", how's that for a Trump-worthy ethnic put-down?), so ideologically speaking we're in pretty messed-up territory.This 21st-century variation on the theme does its best to please liberals by making the villain a union-busting capitalist, and conservatives by making him a godless blasphemer. The murders and sacrilege he instigates for no discernible reason before the credits clearly establish him as a bad guy, but the socio-economic gibberish that is thrown at us seems intended mainly to give some faint shadow of meaning to the festival of random violence to come. The core message is pure traditional Western: real men are better killers, and do cool things like spin their pistols or eject spent cartridges with a pensive squint. Frequent appearances of the cross remind us whose side God is on, however, so we can enjoy the mayhem with a clear conscience."
" Eight
",2019-07-15 00:00:00,8,Pretty Good Movie. Old fashioned Western with all the Bells and Whistles now available to Hollywood. Plus a High Caliber Cast of veteran well known Actors.A lot went into to this production !! and it shows but I thought it should have been the Magnificent Eight since Haley Bennett as Emma pulls her weight.
" Video game content stuffed into a film
",2019-07-14 00:00:00,3,"I haven't seen the original. So, I can't compare compare the quality of the film on that basis. I think the diverse and talented cast (and crew) is the best thing this has going for it and why I'm giving it any stars at all. Also, I'm sure the time, effort, work, and money that went into making this was tremendous.Sadly, I think that talent and film time was not used very well. There is next to zero character development or anything else that draws you into the plight of the protagonists. Sure, we're all against a homicidal maniac raiding a defenseless town in the old west. Justice must prevail! The villain is a truly despicable cur, but even his role as the principal antagonist is lost in the gunsmoke. Why is he doing this exactly? Oh, because he's a greedy scumbag. Got it.The background of ""the seven"" is equally vague. You wonder (because the film says nothing absolute) whether some of them are also brutal villains who are only doing right for the wrong reasons. They're not very likeable or understandable. You don't care if they perish or not. It's okay to have heroes with character flaws and even rogue heroes can appeal to an audience when their personal struggles are brought into the plot. However, this film doesn't touch on that much, and that's a shame. I'm sure the actors had developed character backgrounds leading to their performances, but the film doesn't capture that very well.The old west is a part of American history. Sure, it's filled with legends and exaggerations. I like that. They make great movies. However, I feel that they've totally thrown all historical accuracy through the barroom window here. They don't even have the right number of stars on the flag. The characters are speaking in modern lingo. The costumes, etc... So, no educational value here either. (big surprise)So, what you're left with is 2 hours of (mostly) humorless brutality and violence in which the heroes attempt to save the town (which seems to get totally wrecked in the process anyway).I think we'd have been better off if the film hadn't taken itself so seriously, had more humor, less (pointless or otherwise) violence, and/or a lot more character development and background. As it is, I feel like I'm watching a fps video game where there ought to be a ticker in the lower left hand corner for the body count with some cut-scenes thrown in. My opinion is (of course) subjective. Maybe others got more out of it than that.I don't often have the time to post a movie review, but I felt compelled to cast my vote here in favor of making fewer movies like this one. Because unfortunately, it doesn't stand alone."
" Violent, Mostly Unintentional Silliness
",2019-07-10 00:00:00,6,"I finally got around to see the 2016 version of The Magnificent Seven. It had nothing in common with the original other than the title and they were both supposedly westerns. The 2016 Seven was just plain dumb. A lot of what made it dumb was the over-the-top bloodshed. Then there was the clear attempt at politically correct inclusiveness concerning those 7. The movie started out with Denzel Washington walking into a saloon and every new gunslinger that came onto the screen during those early scenes who was not one of the evil bad guys was obviously going to be a member of the Seven. And every new gunslinger was of a different demographic. I wonder if they considered having a gun-wielding person in a motorized wheelchair. It would not have taken the craziness of the movie that much further into the absurd.Then they ended the movie with some moving, heart-rendering music as they showed the graves of those of the Seven who did not survive the carnage, as though the film were some real-life portrayal of actual heroes. I will say that if I were my 15 year-old simpleminded self, I might have thought The Magnificent Seven was a pretty cool, what with all its various shootings, stabbings and sundry explosions."
" Ok movie
",2019-07-09 00:00:00,4,The only thing that I can't get out of my head is the ridiculous off shoulder dress the main actress was wearing. It was annoying me the whole movie.
" Not Magnificent but..
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,7,"...Still very entertainingObviously not a patch on the original film, but decent enough with plenty of action"
" Another job, another 7
",2019-07-04 00:00:00,7,"The only thing connecting this film with the original masterpiece from John Sturges is that theme which opens and closes this version of The Magnificent Seven. Other than that it's a different cause and a different seven.Denzel Washington heads this group of denizens of the west, some no better than
they ought be. some a lot worse. This is a good mix which also consists of Chris
Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Byung Han Lee, Manuel Garcia Rulfo and
Martin Sensmeier.Recent widow Haley Bennett recruits Washington to in turn recruit some others. The Calvera of this version is industrialist Peter Sarsgard who has hired
an army and can and does hire more as the need arises.The climax is a long one and looks more like a military battle than some outlaws running amuck. And unlike the 1960 version Washington and Sarsgard have some history.This Magnificent Seven can stand on its own and it's got action aplenty. But
it doesn't come near what John Sturges and also Akira Kurosawa did."
" In my opinion, it's MAGNIFICENT!
",2019-06-27 00:00:00,8,"I'm no stranger to movies. Especially older movies. I love the original so much. And truthfully, when it comes to remakes, I honestly hate them. I usually find them completely pointless. Red Dawn, Clash of the Titans, Karate Kid, all classic movies with terrible remakes in my opinion. But not this movie! I was completely engaged from beginning to end! Though it had the same general storyline, the characters were all different and I felt like that was a smart move. They certainly did not refuse to give shoutouts to the original which was great!
First off the casting was spot on! All seven of the heroes were likable in their own way! Denzel Washington never disappoints. He was able to embrace his badass leader role, make it his own, while channeling a little of the late Yul Brynner. Chris Pratt gave us a touch of the late Steve McQueen, while also making the character his own with his typical comic relief. Ethan Hawke is always great and his reunion with Denzel since their Training Day film gave me a big smile! Vincent D'Onofrio gave another unique performance, Byung -Hun Lee brought in his storm shadow character to the old west which, to me, wasn't cheesy at all, it was very entertaining! Manuel Garcia Rulfo and Martin Sensmeier gave us the Mexican and Native Indigenous roles we don't see enough of in movies! I loved the diversity touch.
The villains were very good and hatable as they should be! There wasn't a love story we needed to worry about, just a lot of good action and a very simple story line!
Sometimes we need that! My only complaint was that it could have been longer! I would have loved to been given more back stories for each of the heroes. But for what it had to offer, I'd definitely say this movie was worth seeing! If you want entertainment, good gun battles, and a fun cast, this movie is for you! This movie isn't an Oscar nominee in any way but it's most definitely a good time and a fun ride from start to finish!"
" Magnificent 7? Truly a 7/7!
",2019-06-03 00:00:00,8,"If you like guns, outlaws, and old westerns, Magnificent 7 is the movie for you!? This action packed film tells the story of seven talented men saving the town of Rose Creek from greedy Bartholomew Bogue. The seven men are forced to seek aid from fellow farmers and townspeople of Rose Creek to fend off the army Bogue creates. This film has audience members on the edge of their seats from brilliant acting, costumes, and shots.The director of the film is Antoine Fuqua. He has directed other films such as The Equaliser series and Training day. One can really tell that Antoine's favorite type of film is action. In fact, Antoine's film Training day won an Academy Award.One of the big overturns of Magnificent 7 is the immense amount of brilliant actors. I honestly don't know how Antoine scored to have Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke all into one film. Although these actors are very well known and talented at their jobs, Magnificent 7 took their minor actors very seriously. Each minor character in the film is spot on with the old western accents and look. It truly puts the film over the edge.The costumes in the film are all authentic as well. This helps the audience to feel one with the film and put themselves in the character's shoes. Some people don't know the importance of costumes in film especially when it is placed in the 1800s. If the costumes were not authentic, this would distract the audience from the actual plot of the film. This reminds me of another film placed in the past who had very good costumes, Saving Private Ryan. This film, directed by the famous Steven Spielberg is placed in the time period of World War Two. Every soldier in that film had the wool green jackets and hard helmets just like a real soldier entering battle in the 1940s. This is exactly like Magicant 7. The actors were wearing cowboy hats, vests, and packing colts six shooters just like in the old west.The shots in Magnificent 7 are another thing to talk about. The final battle of the film was just about one fourth of the entire film and the shots were amazing. The low and high angle shots give a sense of power to the intense Mexican standoffs. One particular scene with amazing shots is the opening scene when Bogue is initially taking over Rose Creek. He storms into the chapel where the whole town is nervously waiting. The way the shots plays with close up shots gives the audience the true emotions of the townspeople.One thing that could be improved upon in the film is the overarching message. It was difficult for me to even distinguish it. The message fell along the lines of being courageous and standing up for yourself but put in context of the film it involved doing this while killing other people. This seemed contradictory and didn't make sense.In the end though, the actors, costumes and shots definitely outweighed the poor message of the film. The constant ups and downs of the action does not have you falling asleep while you watch it. I would highly recommend Magnificent 7 as it is definitely worth while watching."
" LANGUAGE
",2019-05-23 00:00:00,1,"The language isn't even reviewed or listed for this movie. Within the first few mins we heard much more than mild language. GD was dropped within the first 12 mins. We ALWAYS look up reviews before watching any movie & we rely on their accuracy, VERY disappointed."
" Muscular Western headed by Denzel Washington is superior to the hokey original
",2019-04-24 00:00:00,7,"A woman (Haley Bennett) seeking justice after the murder of her husband enlists a bounty hunter (Denzel Washington), who gathers six others, to defend the woman's southwestern town against a ruthless army hired by a destructive industrialist (Peter Sarsgaard). Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Byung-Hun Lee, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo and Martin Sensmeier play the other six gunfighters.""The Magnificent Seven"" (2016) is a reimagining of the 1960 Western, which itself was based on Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" (1954). While the plot is contrived the original version had a stellar cast, a magnificent score and great locations, but it was ruined by hokey script flaws. For instance, the teen Chico (Buchholz) was able to effortlessly infiltrate Calvera's bandits, utterly fooling them, even though there were only 32 of them by this point (rolling my eyes). Even if Calvera & his brigands failed to make out Chico's face, which is a big IF, his dialogue & accent would've given him away. Keep in mind that Chico was just an unseasoned teen.Another example is the villagers' sudden cowardly turnaround (betrayal), which totally contradicted their earlier resolve. Yes, I realize they learned that the bandits weren't run-off and that they were going to return to the village out of desperation, but there were only like 30-32 bandits left at this juncture and the combined forces of the seven gunmen and the fighting villagers now had the opportunity to annihilate the thugs for good.This version of course eliminates such idiotic writing and ups the ante with the action. The movie's bloody, but no more so than recent Westerns like ""3:10 to Yuma"" (2007) and ""Django Unchained"" (2012). If you like those ones, as well as oldies like ""Duel at Diablo"" (1966) and ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" (1976), you'll like this one. Washington stands tall in the main role while Jennifer Lawrence lookalike Haley Bennett is stunning and superior to Lawrence.The movie runs 2 hours, 12 minutes and was shot in Arizona, New Mexico and one shot in Colorado (Miller Mesa, Ridgway) with the main set being in Jackson, Louisiana.GRADE: B"

" Any old western flick with modern refurbishments.
",2019-04-05 00:00:00,6,"The most prominent thing I understand from the movie is that the actors look like they're having fun. Seven stereotypical characters from any western scene, while not original, are portrayed well by the likes of Chris Pratt, Denzel Washington, and Ethan Hawke. The camera quality is superb, and set design is convincing, I think this movie rides on these two characteristics. As for the script, nothing new, and that's where this movie fails. The storyline is forgettable, and not entirely intriguing. That gets boring when the movie is 2 hours and 15 minutes. The movie does create a strong atmosphere though, and the fight scenes are amazing. It's highly entertaining, highly forgettable, and well shot/choreographed. This is the type of movie to play while at a party or while you're not entirely focused, but it would be enjoyed as much by any age group."
" Magnificent Seven deserves seven

This might not be a great movie as the classic but not bad either. Acting by Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'onofrio and the leading cast is good. Action is good, direction is ok. Screenplay should've been better, background music is good. Overall a good action movie."

Updated characters are magnificent. Really enjoyed their diverse personalities. Only two disappointments, first can't beat music from original version. Second a little unrealistic in a couple ways. Biggest incongruous part was farmers can't hit a target??? Never met a farm boy (and few girls) who are not dead shots able to break down and reload any gun in seconds, or miss a target, especially moving. Necessary for survival in all rural areas today, even more important skill on a frontier way back then."

" Should be Called ""The Throw it Against the Wall, See If it Sticks Remake From Hell....Seven""
",2019-02-17 00:00:00,2,"With a continued trend to diversify a cast that IGNORES historical actualities so that it can creat a Kumbaya setting, this remake of a remake is disaster.Wasting ""A list"" talent with poor writing and a dubious storyline, this film forces us to believe that mysterious personal revenge (although that isnt really sold upfront) by Denzel Washington suddenly becomes a driving force in his lie and he cobbles together a rag tag team to fight an ""evil"" land baron (aren't they all?)In this group are a Chris Pratt, playing a charming card sharp who does or doesn't need the money (didn't he JUST take all the money off the table?), Ethan Hawke, the legendary Condferate sharpshooter haunted by past deeds, Vincent D'Onofrio as a mountain man, and a bunch of others tossed in to make the movie politically correct (THE Mexican, THE Indian (which makes no sense at all), THE Kung Fu Asian , and, most historically inaccurately a shoulder baring heroine as an erstwhile 8th member. Why???)You get the idea and figure where the action goes. Good vs Bad. Who lives? Dies? Etc. If you remember the original, or, the vastly superior Seven Samurais on which both were based, this nonsense will frustrate you enormously. If you've seen neither, get em instead. I give this 2 stars out of 10 because it's a western, has great stunts and, uh, is in color?"
" Missed opportunity.
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,3,"Did anybody else think it came closer to a Blazing Saddles re-make than the Magnificent Seven? What would have raised it to a great movie would have been Slim Pickens trying to get Denzil Washington to sing Camptown Races.The Seven here were closer to the Village People than to Yul and his gang, we were only a Motorcycle Cop short.A great cast let down by a very poor script, why wasn't Skaarsgard twiddling his moustache as he said, 'bring on the Gatling gun.' And what a coincidence that such a bunch of desperadoes were suddenly ready to lay down their lives to save a small town. The script and screenplay could have been written by a 5 year old, and not necessarily the brightest five year old in the class."
" A decent modern Western watch
",2019-02-10 00:00:00,8,"I found this film tense and gripping, with slick gun fight scenes that were well choreographed. There's nice cinematography with some good aerial shots of the landscape.The background music was judged well - it wasn't too loud or overbearing, nor was it lacking.I thought it was an engrossing and atmospheric watch for the most part. However, there was the ocassional cliched accent which I didn't like too much but otherwise, its a good tense watch. Some of the plot details were perhaps slightly simplistic but that aside I very much enjoyed it. Would I recommend it? yes I would - its not perfect but its pretty decent. Also, I haven't seen the original film, so I can't comment on it in terms of it being a remake."
" Doesn't live up to the 60s original

Maybe they were all pulled in because of the status of the original, with a view that they'd be cementing their positions with this update. Unfortunately the whole thing feels like a procession. Perhaps it's because the original is so well known, but the film lacks a true spark to it."

You never really find out what the pay is. The villain is seriously vile. Musically not as good as its predecessor. Save for Denzel the cast is probably not as well known and they are quite a different bunch come together at the request of a woman on behalf of frightened villagers (not Mexican-in this case). The big showdown which has to come is lengthy, so don't take your eyes off the screen. Well worth a watch, maybe two. The original I would suspect you will watch over and over. This one, you probably wont. Huge amount more violence too"
" The decadent seven...
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,3,"Antoine Fuqua is a fan of westerns and epic films from the Golden Age of Hollywood, he cited on interviews about his favorite movies that he watched with his Granny when he was a child such as the all time classics, ""Shane"" and ""The Searchers"".Then, he directed two ""The Magnificent Seven"" remakes, desguised as original films: ""Tears of the Sun"" and ""King Arthur"", both sharing several plot elements from the original Kurosawa classic and the Sturges' western adaptation.
The direct remake from the Yul Brynner's ""passion project"" started early on in the 90's with lots of actors attached to it, from Sylvester Stallone to Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise and even Kevin Costner, but it wasn't greenlighted until about 2010 / 2012, when Fuqua took the project for filming this story for the third time in his resume.Let me say that i like ""Tears of the Sun"", probably the last breath of the good ole Bruce Willis before he went into crappy projects and sleepwalking performances and ""King Arthur"", even if not historical accurate, it's a great adventure film, shot in the good old style of filmmaking with a perfectly selected cast.Now, this remake is not only the worst of the trio, but also a disgrace to the Kurosawa classic and Sturges' inspired take on the story.
The screenplay looks like it was written by teenagers, fans of 'shoot 'em up', there's no sense of plot, there's no morals, no codes of honour, no reasons for their change of hearts, it's just 7 random guys that love to shoot and decided to die in that village. because the plot asked to do so, plus the dialogue is terribly scripted and sounds phony in the most part.The cinematography is dull and looks like a DTV film; the art and costume design looks like a 'costume party"" in 2016 that tries too much to be the Old West, but some of the action scenes are well staged and shot (i give them that...) and the stuntwork, especially the death scenes (like Ethan Hawke's demise in the bellow tower) are among the best things about this abortion of a film.Then, it comes the cast... probably the cast director was sleeping on service or doing the routine ""let's create diversity like a Benetton poster"" for even the Eskimo people to not complain, decision supported a full throttle by the director Fuqua.Denzel Washington plays Sam Chisolm in a role originated by Toshiro Mifune and then Yul Brynner as Chris Larabee Adams, the leader of the 7.
Well, Denzel looks ridiculous in a western, and even more if his character was poorly developed and his lines are cringeworthy, and even if Mr. Denzel have in his possession 2 Oscars already and (i don't even remember how much...) nominations, he just can't 'catwalk' or be as cool or as imposing as the late great, Mr. Brynner.Then, that 'Bozo, the clown', Chris Pratt, who owns a great debt to some 'Godfather' in Hollywood, was cast in the 'King of Cool' Steve McQueen's role, when he was just playing the western version of his irritating Peter Quill / Star-Lord character, he's not worthy to fill the McQueen's boots, even if he sold his soul to the devil in search for talent...Ethan Hawke, reunited with Denzel after Fuqua's ""Training Day"", looks as much as a cajun as Sean Connery looks like an Egyptian in ""Highlander"" (but at least with Connery it worked), this kind of role as a gunfighter ""Angel of Death"" or so is totally out of his range, he did not acts or even looks the part... His character here is a mix of Brad Dexter (the greedy) and Robert Vaughn (the coward) from the Sturges' film.Vincent D'Onofrio, in the Charles Bronson role (Ok, i give you a minute to laugh hard...), the Robert De Niro of lesser films, overacts and hams up so badly that almost turned the movie into the ""Blazing Saddles"" spoof territory.The rest of the 7 is full of unknowns giving stereotyped / bland performances, except for Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, who delivered the best performance from the cast as the 'bandito"" Vasquez, he incorporated some of the legendary Eli Wallach's witty remarks to his performance (because his character have no counterpart in the Brynner's 7) and he kind of stole the movie everytime he was on screen even with limited screentime for a 6th billed actor.Peter Sarsgaard looks and acts like a 'cry baby' straight from Adam Driver's performance in the new ""Star Wars"" films, his menacing valour is below zero, the same for his entire performance.In short, watch instead the Kurosawa original film; the fabulous John Sturges' remake and the three low-budget sequels: 2nd still with Brynner, 3rd with George Kennedy and 4th with Lee Van Cleef, and even the short lived TV Show starring Michael Biehn, but skip this one..."
" Stop comparing it to the 1960 version
",2019-02-05 00:00:00,8,"My mother took me to see the 1960 Yul Brynner version when I was 8 years old and I loved it, I have also loved it the many times I've seen it since. So I was keen to see this, remake? hmm ok the story is basically the same but it has a lot of changes that I don't need to list here. If you have seen the original and who hasn't then forget it, this is fab shoot 'em up western with as many PC characters as they could cram in to one film, I mean a black gunslinger in the 1860's? unlikely but I can ignore it.Realistic? don't be silly Hollywood doesn't do realistic they do escapism and this is a very good example of it. Ignore the bad reviews, it's a fun ride."
" Underwhelming
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,5,"When this movie was released in 2016, I avoided seeing it. Why? Because the 1960 movie The Magnificent Seven is one of my all-time 5 favourite westerns and I did not think that another version could be as good.
By 2019, curiosity got the better of me and I watched the new version - and I was right: it is nowhere near as good. What I discovered is that the 2016 movie is not a remake but a re-imagining. The characters are different - different names, different backgrounds, different outcomes - and the differences are not to my liking.
The emphasis is on over-the-top action at the expense of character development, which was one of the highlights of the 1960 movie. Then, at the height of the action, with bodies spilling all over the place, two characters will have a 3-minute conversation in complete calm while the carnage goes on around them.
To be fair, I may have given this movie a higher rating had I not been such a fan of the 1960 movie. My rating reflects my inevitable comparison with the 1960 movie - and in this regard the 2016 movie is found sadly wanting.
The most puzzling question is: With 2 highly successful predecessors - The Seven Samurai (1954) and The Magnificent Seven (1960) - why did they bother making such an inferior product?"
" Shockingly bad.
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,1,"As a Denzil Washington fan, I was desparately disappointed in this movie. In the original, we had compassion and identification with all the characters, and missed them as they disappeared.. Whereas in this...???? I just didn't care about any of them. Remakes should be better. Unfortunately, the original M7 cannot be improved upon."
" Straight shooters
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,6,"Antoine Fuqua goes for a gritty actioned packed remake with some smooth actors.Set in 1879. Land baron Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) and his group of hired help have become rich by driving out or killing homesteaders.The people of Rose Creek have had enough of this bully. Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) persuades Sam Chisholm (Denzel Washington) to help get rid off Bogue. It takes some persuasion and Chisholm has had a past run in with Bogue.Chisholm recruits roguish gambler Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt.) Sharpshooter Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke) lacks confidence with his aim. His friend Billy Rocks (Lee Byung-hun) is the knifeman. The Mexican outlaw Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) does not have a German accent. Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio) is a bear of a mountain man. Comanche Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier) brings his arrow game.This is a modern meat and potatoes western. Once the seven players are established, they train the townsfolk, give some stirring speeches and it is on to the showdown.The final battle is well staged and Sarsgaard is having a hoot as the villain. It is both silly and entertaining at the same time.Those who think the casting is political correctness gone mad. The John Sturges version had the Russian-Mongolian, Yul Brynner as the lead."
" Great remake
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,8,Ok it was never gonna beat the original clsssic 7 but this came pretty close too. I have watched this movie a few times and i enjoy every time. Denzil plays the part so well and tho he may not of been everybodies choice of taking on the role previously played by Yul Brynner but he does it very well.
" The Not So Magnificent Seven
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,7,"This is a decent western but is no comparison to the original 1960 film. I particularly like a western with stirring theme music but in this area this film was so unlike the original. It was so predictable at times. I knew that the good Indian would kill the bad one or that the girl would kill the final living bad man in the church scene near the end. The death toll in this big budget movie would have been similar to the battle of the Little Big Horn. The film needed a John Wayne, James Stewart, Steve McQueen or Glenn Ford to give us characters that we can identify with. Nevertheless, for big fans of 50's westerns like myself, it's fairly decent for a western in the modern era."
" How not to make a western...
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,1,"The original was magnificent, this is just a load of shakycam footage. Westerns should be made with smooth, wide angle camera moves. They don't make them like they used to!"
" Entertaining but....
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,7,"The 1960 ""Magnificent Seven"" with Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn, Horst Buchholz and Brad Dexter is a magnificent movie. Maybe the best western of all time and fairly true to ""The Seven Samurai"" on which it is based. The 2016 version starring Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke is entertaining enough that if it wasn't a remake of a far superior movie, would stand on its own as a fun film. This version is sort of a fun, fantasy western that never makes the viewer feel he could be watching something that could actually have happened. It takes pains to be politically correct so the 7 are a mix of black, white, Hispanic, Asian and Indian while the bad guys, instead of being the Mexican bandits of the 1960 film, are of course, white villains. The 1960 version with 7 gunfighters being hired to protect a Mexican village from perpetually plundering bandits seemed a far more likely scenario.But the 2016 version is not without merit. Far from it. It's fun. Denzel Washington is riveting as always. His character is loosely based on Yul Brynner's leader of the original (not counting the Samurai) 7. Chris Pratt, in one of his first starring roles, is magnetic. He deftly handles the role played by Steve McQueen in 1960. Subtleties reveal Pratt's character's name is Josh, which was the name of McQueen's character in a 1950s TV series ""Wanted Dead or Alive."" And in one scene, Pratt uses a sawed off Winchester, the trademark weapon of McQueen's ""Josh"" in ""Wanted Dead or Alive."" Hawke, who I always find a very gifted actor who unfortunately went to the Matthew Modine School of Absolutely No Charisma, is very good and finally charismatic in a combination of the 1960 roles of Vaughn and Dexter. Byung-Hun Lee has the Coburn role as the killer-of-all-trades. There is no correlation of the roles originally played by Bronson or Bucholz. But Vincent D'Onofrio, who is always amazing, plays a grizzled tracker who joins the group, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo is outstanding as a Hispanic gunfighter enlisted in the cause and finally Martin Sensmeier portrays an Indian suspiciously recruited apparently to fulfill this United Nations version of the Seven. In the original, Eli Wallach was convincing as the bandit leader. Sadly, Peter Sarsgaard, usually a very convincing actor, seems to be somewhere else in all of his scenes as the current villain leader, so his demise is far less rewarding than that of Wallach in the original.In all, any comparison between the 2016 and 1960 versions will greatly disappoint those hoping for a quality remake. Several lines of dialogue are lifted directly from the original, which is a way of paying homage. But otherwise, this is a different movie with a similar idea. But as long as you accept this version as a somewhat light-hearted and fun movie on its own instead of comparing it to the superior original, it can be quite entertaining."
" Definitely not what I thought!

" A somewhat decent western riddled in cliches.
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,6,"I can see where this would have been a great movie back in 1976. Literally every scene is like a bit of a parody of an old Clint Eastwood western. It tries very hard to be a new classic but ultimately falls way short. I was never really attached to any of the characters and honestly I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a comedy the first 30 minutes of the film. With all those negatives out of the way, I can say that if you have nothing better to do and you can watch it for free on Amazon or Netflix, it's worth the money. The action and set peices are good enough to keep you entertained, just don't expect greatness. Also, I have to say that with the caliber of actors that they got, I'm pretty disappointed overall. Sorry if I sound too negative, I'm just being honest."
" A Decent but Unremarkable Western
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,6,"25 December 2016. Unlike The Quick and The Dead (1995), the remake of The Magnificent Seven doesn't have the same psychological suspense, even though the audience knows the outcome, except for which characters will die. The gun shooting with the climatic scenes sometimes seem to be so blase by contemporary standards. And the set up is something the audience has seen before, again and again. The spaghetti western close ups that have been so effective have been replaced by a more subdued, artistic, but not as stylized photographic style. Somehow the personal intensity and the humanity of the characters have been starched away, even though Ethan Hawkes gives it a good try. Even the lead antagonist seems so aloof even his film presence seems to be part of the background instead of the foreground."

They don't even know how to write new material, hence why they just keep purloining better works! But this is a real stinker! Yes, it is politically correct. And in typical millennial fashion, everything is shot the same as Netflix TV shows.With generic nondescript stock music; bereft of melody, motif & inimitable orchestra hierarchy; where low subs & sampled feral percussion pound away like The Dark Knight. And the strobe editing compensates for a complete lack of understanding what makes a scene feel real, tense, & historically imaginative.Life was slow back then. But the director thought that constantly strafing dolly shots looked more ""cool"" & contempo. You had gun fights where there were long pauses in shoot-outs where people had to reload. But the director thought it best to have all the shots evenly spaced (1 every half a second) so it sounds more ""cool"" & action-packed in the cinema. There was less dialog, more stares & long pauses, but the director thought that long preachy self-righteous eulogies with that droning sub-score was more modern. There was little in the way of hygiene back yonder before warm running water became of age. But instead of ugly, haggard, toothless, sebaceous men with red necks & dirt; we have all perfectly trimmed, immaculate, close shaven, white teeth 'models' - & a fat man.The fact that today's action is a trite bore-fest with interlaced CGI- premeditation reveals that this media has grown dull & predictable. And somewhat worthless, beyond a family smashing their barely conscious capitalist brains out for the evening.Stanley Kubrick once opined that he cared less for what happened, in favour of how it happened.The original still feels timeless, accurate, real, & powerful. Like many westerns back then; They demonstrated how to master one's techniques & therefore be liberated from them. You hardly notice any of the director tropes & daft shaky camera work because there IS none. It is shot with the intention of having no intention. ""The Art of fighting, without fighting"" as Bruce Lee said.If the film makers can't understand this, they are wasting everybody's time. Because I can assure you.. we don't have much time left to waste."

As someone that loves old westerns, I enjoyed it and people that hate old westerns could also enjoy this. People that need the actors from 1960's in a western to enjoy it, fire up your VHS and stop slagging contemporary attempts at the genre when they don't deserve it. Hope this helps."
" Righteous revenge
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,2,"According to chief dramaturgy, we are initially faced with superficial evil to motivate the righteous revenge of heroes. In addition, the idea is that the revenge will receive extra points on moral accounts since the revengers represents all the American ethnicities plus a woman. For every dead villain we are supposed to salute. It becomes lots of it, because the villains are many. Not even Rambo could have killed more bad guys.This re-make is unusually bad. The most impressive thing is the sweat on the actor's skin. Sometimes they might act, looking tough or even afraid. Well, it's not necessarily the actors that are untrue. It's the script that's rotten."
" Loved it!
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,10,Action packed. Exceeded my expectations! I should've know just by the cast and crew that it was gonna be a good one. Gotta watch it again!
" Show the genre some love and watch this magnificent movie
",2018-09-16 00:00:00,9,"Magnificent 7I never really appreciated the Western movie genre when I was a kid.
I vaguely remember watching the original Magnificent 7 with my dad as a youngster.
I was in to Star Wars, Jaws and Rocky. 
Cowboy movies were for the oldies. Spaceships were for the cool kids.
It was only as I grew older and enjoyed movies such as Tombstone, Unforgiven and Open Range that I truly fell in love with the Western.The remake of Magnificent 7 is another reason to show the genre some love.
Antoine Fuqua's movie is a rip roaring good time.
Everyone involved is equally enjoying the experience as Fuqua has wrangled together a belter of a cast.
Led by the marvellous Denzel Washington and the charismatic Chris Pratt, this retelling of seven men coming together to help a small village is immensely entertaining.
Action is supremely staged and the sound of gunfights are best experienced in surround sound.
But a film with only action is not enough.
The Director probably wished he had more time to develop the movies superb characters but with a runtime of 2hr 12mins this isn't a short movie. Fuqua has had to juggle as much as possible to fit everything into the films runtime.
Magnificent 7 never drags. It has a great pace which keeps the audience invested from start to finish.
This is helped by each of the seven having their own time to shine and because of the excellent interplay between them.
There's no stand outs here. Everyone is fantastic.
Possibly Pratt and Washington edge it but then there's the superb Ethan Hawke and Vincent D'Onofrio. 
This is perhaps why this movie is so good because each of the seven are truly magnificent.
This is a cowboy movie worth watching over and over again.
This is a movie that prompted me to revisit the original and you know what?
That's a belter of a movie too!"
" The ""Magnificent"" part is very, very debatable
",2018-09-05 00:00:00,3,"As well as every normal male (or female, for that matter) film buff, I'm a tremendous fan of the 1960 Western classic ""The Magnificent Seven"". I honestly don't think you can have anything against that film, and you can't even object to the idea of a remake, since the original itself is already a remake of Akira Kurasawa's landmark ""Seven Samurai"". So here I was looking forward to Antoine Fuqua's version, albeit with reasonably low expectations; - just a good two hours of undemanding but exciting gunslinger entertainment! What a major disappointment! ""The Magnificent Seven"" isn't the least bit spectacular or memorable, it's just plain boring and inferior on every possible level. Although I tried hard not to compare, it's just inescapably evident that Hollywood can't assemble a kick-ass ensemble cast anymore like they could in 1960. How on earth do you recast icons like Yul Brunner, Steven McQueen, Charles Bronson and James Coburn? With Denzel Washington? He's okay, I guess. Chris Pratt? Meh! Ethan Hawke? No way! Vincent D'Onofrio? What the hell! The painful truth is that not a single character of the 2016-version deserves to even stand in the shadows of the 1960-version protagonists. That goes for the villainous characters as well, by the way, since Peter Sarsgaard isn't exactly menacing as the supposedly merciless and megalomaniac landowner Bartholomew Bogue. Heck, his minions even must do stuff like spit chewing tobacco on the church's floor to emphasize just how evil they are. Oh, and don't even get me started on how obviously the script is politically correct. Lame!"
" A good, fun, action packed ride lacking true distinction
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,7,"Magnificent Seven (2016)A movie purposely filled with archetypes (or some would say, clichés). That's part of the fun of it, and it's also part of the limitation because you know, roughly, what's going to happen long before it does. What you savor is how it happens.
And so in classic fashion (like the true movie original to all this, ""The Seven Samurai""--note that Kurosawa is even one of the writers credited here), a group of seven super talented but varied fighters are assembled to wreak revenge on a large and ruthless gang. The ""good"" guys are not all good (they have checkered pasts), but the bad guys are purely pad. So you know who to root for.
The famous twist here is the leader of the Seven is a black man played by Denzel Washington. The novelty of that is not really so novel (""Unforgiven"" brought Morgan Freeman to the Western in 1992), but having such a great actor hold it all together is good news. The gathering of different types of fighters (an Asian knife thrower, a Native American with bow and arrow, etc.) goes step by step and is fun, and the training of the townspeople to help has some humor and tension.
Ethan Hawke and Peter Sarsgaard are standouts among the large cast of main characters, and they help keep the movie quirky and intense. Haley Bennett (as the only female with a large role) is also important.
But mostly this is an action film, with a lot of shooting and dynamic camera and things blowing up. It's fun stuff, well done of course. But as I said, the outcome is kind of known, and so any real tension is missing. Enjoy the characters, enjoy the sense of good vs. evil., and enjoy the scenery, one of those things all Westerns depend on."
" Solid western. Slow start, but a thrilling final. Not a classic, but good enough.
",2018-08-26 00:00:00,7,"Difficult to add something new to the western genre, so why not do a remake of an old classic? That's what director Antoine Fuqua did with the old western classic The Magnificent Seven. And the result is a solid western, with a somewhat slow start, but a thrilling action packed final in the last hour.The story: 7 cowboys defend a town against outlaws, culminating in a massive battle for life and death.Denzel Washington steals the show, his acting performance truly is impressive. I believe he is THE coolest cowboy out there. But all the actors are great and I really think that the acting is the best part of this western. Great roles by Chris Pratt (jokes), Vincent D'onofrio and Ethan Hawke. And Peter Sarsgaard is a terrific creepy bad guy.If I would have to rate westerns this one would certainly become one that I wanna watch more often than just once. I already did. Must been the third time I have seen it, and although it aint a terrific western it certainly is good enough to leave me behind with a thrilling feeling. Beware all the thrilling action is only to be found in the last hour, with features a magnificent end battle. Even if the first hour might be somewhat slow, you wont regret it watching it if you are into westerns with great acting performances."
" Don't compare to the original(s), good watch
",2018-08-23 00:00:00,7,"Going into the movie not knowing it was a remake and enjoying the movie for what it actually is, I thought it was a good watch. Had some good one liners, great cast, and all in all thought it was a good movie. Again, if you don't compare it to the original like most other reviews are, it's worth a watch for sure."
" A modern day spaghetti western
",2018-08-15 00:00:00,1,"Lots of violence, little morality, little reality and no likable characters. Though not made in Italy, this is a spaghetti western."
" A good remake
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,8,"Yes I know, it's yet another Hollywood remake, but try watching this movie without comparing it to the original.
I for one enjoyed it and I will be adding it to my ""watch again"" list.
The characters where good and the story line was well thought out with a couple of twists that where not in the original.
because this is a remake, the story line is a bit predictable but as I said, try not to hold that against it. there are many remakes out there that are in some cases better than the originals.
I'm not saying this version is better, but it is a good remake and well worth a watch."
" Best Version
",2018-08-12 00:00:00,7,Having seen Kurosawa's Seven Samurai then Sturges' version in 1960 and now Antoine Fuqua's great work in 2016 all I can say it just keeps getting better but for different reasons. I gave it 7 stars for the technological work in cinematography. It reminded me a little of Sergio Leone's work with extreme closeups of the characters. Brilliantly done.
" Stupid predictable plot
",2018-08-05 00:00:00,1,Haley Bennett's performance and direction was spectacular but the plot was stupid. The cast all did a good job. The sets were simpleton. Obviously not filmed in gold country.
" Love the diversity
",2018-07-23 00:00:00,8,"Denzel, Chris, and all of the diverse casting is what I love about this movie. Denzel's acting is impeccable. Chris Pratt is good, but his character could have used more development and additional scene takes.Vincent D'Onofrio is screamingly funny, and Byung-Hun Lee is sizzling hot. Holy bleep!Pete Sarsgaard makes the most riveting villain I have seen in years. That final scene between Denzel and him is pure genius (whether or not it follows earlier versions of the plot).Antoine Fuqua's casting could not have been better. BRILLIANT!"
" Feel the Need for a Good Western..
",2018-06-05 00:00:00,1,"Avoid this like the plague.

" Not disastrous, but the original hasn't lost its crown
",2018-05-21 00:00:00,7,"A ragtag bunch of loner mercenaries join together to defend a townful of innocents against a predatory (and far better armed) force which greatly outnumbers them. That synopsis fits this film and also its multiple forbears, starting with Kurosawa's Seven Samurai and including (of course) John Sturges' seminal 1960 western, and Roger Corman's rather less seminal Battle Beyond The Stars. The villain of the piece here is a property baron looking to extort the population of a town out of their land, using murder when necessary. Denzel Washington heads up the seven, in a nice selection of characters which both echo the original yet manage to be their own characters.That is the mark of this film: it often references its predecessor (the knife fight in the railroad stock yard, for instance) yet it is quite different in execution. I must say that the final reference - wait for the closing credits - gripped me by the throat and didn't let go.It is not without flaws: deaths of members of the seven flash by during the (well-staged) final battle, for instance, without them having the impact they should have. There is a closing voiceover which obviously exists only to have the word ""magnificent"" in it: it is contrived, clumsy and completely unnecessary. And Sarsgard's baddie, Bartholomew Bogue, is either badly conceived or badly performed, with an air of mildly exasperated but languid impatience which doesn't really feel credible.And it appeared to me that much of Fuqua's direction, in the early part, at least, seemed to be based on the assumption that none of the audience had ever seen a western. However, given how long the western has been out of favour, that may well be true.For all that, it is a decent enough movie. Not as epic or iconic as its predecessor, to be sure, but not bad at all."
" Really Fun To Watch
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,8,"Is it a masterpiece? No. But does it entertain you as a film should? Definitely. The acting is all great, but of course it is with so many fantastic actors. Chris Pratt once again is the stand out star in my opinion. He's his usual hilarious, charming and cool self. They did a great job with the fight scenes, special effects/practical effects and the writing is also really well done. An all around good movie. The only thing I can really fault it for is not having more speaking roles for actresses. Only one susbstantial female role in the whole movie. Other than that is was really good."
" Needless Remake
",2018-04-15 00:00:00,5,A poor and needless remake that ups the body count but not the quality.Inferior in every way to the Bryner/McQueen/Coburn version but probably enjoyable to the Transformers generation

Litterally, they replaced the bad indians easy to shoot by bad englishes easy to shoot. Great shooting though, but not enough french to be taken seriously."
" Brutal

" Can't go less than 1
",2018-04-03 00:00:00,1,"I never leave reviews, but I'm leaving this one with the wish that I could somehow send it back to my past self to try and save the two hours that was just wasted on this completely vacuous movie. 
Nothing happened. 
We got from A to B sure, but it was entirely banal. How do we spend two hours with this film and develop zero relationship with any of the characters? Any at all? That's includes main characters, villain, villagers that need saving, village, setting, none of it, we care about none of it because nothing meaningful or well-developed occurs by way of plot, dialogue, character development, or directing. This was so pointless. To say that the characters are cliched actually gives the writing and the direction way too much credit, a good cliche can be fun. These characters were too thin and poorly constructed to even fully become cliches. Seriously how was two hours so poorly spent? 
Some have said Denzel was the only good thing here and to be frank he wasn't, it's just always nice to see Denzel. He wasn't bad, none the actors were bad, there was just so little substance to the script, that none of them could be good. 
I didn't even have high hopes for this thing, yet still felt my time got truly wasted by whichever numbskulls wrote, financed and directed this film. Seriously if you want at all to enjoy good characters, and good plot, even a tiny bit, then go watch something else. 
*sigh*"
" Not sure what movie the nay sayers saw on here..
",2018-02-21 00:00:00,8,"I am seeing a lot of negative reviews for this film on here and I must say I am puzzled. This was a high action remake that in many ways was better then the original. Let me say first that the orig. M7 eluded me for a long time and I finally got to see it from beginning to end uninterrupted just last year and found it enjoyable, but I was left with a lot of questions after watching it and in some ways the plot didn't make sense. So with the orig., in a nutshell:1. Bad guys bother villagers.
2. Villagers fed up get good guys to help.
3. Good guys teach villagers to defend themselves.
4. Good guys and villagers fight off first wave of bad guys.
5. Villagers don't want good guys anymore.
6. Bad guys return, and in uncharacteristic manner, let good guys go
 to town limits and give them their weapons back.
7. And here is the most puzzling - Good guys return, even though the villagers don't want them anymore, and even though their lives were spared by the bad guys, kill all the bad guys and get 4 out of 7 of themselves killed...for what?And this is the plot everyone is defending on here with the nostalgia look at the old M7 when reviewing the new M7? Pulease.Those making the claim that the orig. was SO much better, might need to see the original again. Good Movie yes (besides what I pointed out above) but it too WAY too long and the pace was just too slow. This new movie has a steady pace and easy to follow.This movie was a refreshing look @ M7, which had me hoping that they make a remake of the ""Return of the M7"" but seeing the money it made that probably wont happen.Solid action western you need to see. Something tells me you will enjoy it more if you didn't see the original (esp. if it has been a long time since you've seen it) without all the nostalgia :-)"
" Turn Brain Off And It's Fun
",2018-02-13 00:00:00,7,"(Flash Review)This is the epitome of Hollywood. Take a legendary film, Seven Samurai, dumb it way down, crank the action to ten, make each character a unique stereotype and scribble a shallow story. Yet the result is fun when mentally prepared. For those unfamiliar with Seven Samurai, a small town hires a skilled samurai to defend their town. Much the same here as a skilled bounty hunter, Denzel, is hired to save them from a murdering gang threatening to take their land. Much of the movie is the recruitment as Denzel over-easily convinces six more guys to aid him. Will they be able to save the townsfolk and their land? I felt Chris Pratt was miscast. I like him but I never believed his personality type ever existed in a Western era. While the action was fun and relentless at times, it was manic for a Western. Peter Sarsgaard always plays a great villain and he did again. Overall, this is a mildly and mindless entertaining hyper-action 'Western'."
" Too ""conventionally"" modern for its own good...
",2018-01-22 00:00:00,6,"The concept of ""Seven Samurai"" is so simple that it's hard to believe it took half a century for a director to come up with the mission-team trope. But that's why Akira Kurosawa was such a genius, he made the seminal action movie and it worked so well that it didn't take much for its Western remake to become a classic on its own merits.
 
The ingredients are simple and so is the structure: poor people oppressed by a corrupt and powerful man, the recruiting of the seven, the bonding with the villagers which is the meat of the story, then the climactic battle where four of the seven meet their demise. The success of the film depends on how each of these segments are handled and how the cast manages to transcend the material by making us relate to each player or enjoy their presence and interactions.But it's not as easy as it sounds, the original was a three-hour epic with a clear three-act structure, not only we could identify each Samurai but each death resonated as a mini-tragedy. ""The Magnificent Seven"", less epic but as entertaining, managed to make at least five of them pretty endearing in a briefer lapse of time. Now, the problem with Antoine Fuqua's 2016 remake is that it's obviously admiring the original material and does the best to duplicate its magic, but it never seems to take its own characters seriously enough, not the magnificent, not the villagers, so why should we care?
 
As expected, each of the seven embodies a particular trait, Denzel Washington is Sam Chisolm, the Ace, his establishing moment consists on the 'permanent' arrest of a wanted criminal and a few collateral damages. The scene works but it's so reminiscent of one of King Schultz' deeds in ""Django Unchained"" that it's instantly forgettable. Chris Pratt is the cool one, who enjoys a magic card trick or two and spends half his time delivering a wisecrack. Individually, they're good but together, they're no Brynner and McQueen. Now, I waited for the taciturn one, the third Samurai/James Coburn type. He's a knife thrower played by Byung-Hun Lee, this is an interesting fellow that deserved a more ominous introduction, but as soon as we're finished admiring his skills, we discover that he's only the sidekick of a more legendary sharpshooter named Goodnight Robicheaux and played by Ethan Hawke. Hawke plays the third more three-dimensional member of the seven but I didn't like the way he stole Billy's thunder, relegated to one simple skill.And depth would be a luxury for the other magnificent, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo is a Mexican outlaw who's given a chance by Sam and spends the rest of the time exchanging a few racist quips with Pratt, Vincent D'Onofrio is a religious tracker whose voice is the closest thing to comedy relief, and then there's Martin Sensmeier as an exiled Comanche warrior. They're all colorful and ethnically marked but that's not saying much, the Native is defined by his ability to throw arrows, the knife thrower throws knives the religious nutcase speaks to the Lord, the Mexican is... Mexican. The only oneswho benefit from an extra pinch of depth are Hawke whose troubled actions seem to recall some PTSD shock from the Civil War and Pratt, and Washington. But if you're looking for counterparts to the magnificent seven, don't bother. I didn't expect one but I wish they could have improved the seventh one and made him as a scene stealer as Mifune, but the film didn't even manage to be better than ""Young Guns"", and I loved ""Young Guns"", the film had six protagonists and they were not as expendable as the so-called magnificent. 
This version with Antoine Fuqua is obviously driven by good intentions and the fact that he decided to make a multi-ethnic cast could have given a special texture, but Fuqua also goes for the female heroine trend, and Haley Bennett (the toughest one from the village) is just so bad-ass she overshadows many of the seven. If Fuqua wanted something original, he could have made her the seventh one. It wouldn't have been the least realistic thing about the film, the introduction of the villain had almost killed any attempt to take it seriously.They say a film is as good as its villain, on the basis of Bartholomew Bogue, the film should have been great. Peter Saargard revisits a form of old-fashioned mustached villain that is not uninteresting. That said, I can believe any form of evil exploitation, of throwing people off their land, but that a man would be shot in cold blood in front of witnesses, and a woman being axed from behind and the Marshall, no matter how corrupt he is, would do nothing about it, that's too much. If evil doesn't have standards, then the conception of heroism turns into something 'superhero' binary that doesn't really prompt us to root for anyone, since there's no intellectual challenge. 
But Haley Bennett as the seventh one would've been a challenging twist, but there were more shots on her cleavage than any scenes involving the last three seven put together so I wondered whether her presence was meant to arouse the male audience or to inspire the female one. But the film leaves a little to care about, especially the villagers who're not given enough screen-time or interactions anyway. And since the timing between the entrance and the battle doesn't exceed forty minutes, we couldn't care less about the outcome. 
 
What lacked in the film is a transition between the introduction and the battle, the fact that many deaths left me cold was indicating of how the film was so reliant on the concept that it forgot to tell a genuinely powerful story, it's just about archetypes colliding into each other in a muck of cinematic conventions. It's fun and entertaining at moments, but the rest of the time, I was scratching my head with perplexity."

" Good cast deliver a solid Western
",2018-01-02 00:00:00,7,"'The Magnificent Seven' is perhaps an unnecessary remake - almost 56 years, to the day - but it's just as good as the original. Still the same simple premise - a Western, where a small town is being overthrown by a villain, so they hire a bunch (well, seven, to be precise!) of drifters to help them fight to save the town. It's still set in the 19th century, but the main differences are that the town's not in Mexico this time, and there's much more focus on the church (not necessarily religion).The leader this time is Chisolm (Washington), a bounty hunter (Yul Brenner's character), with Faraday (Pratt) a wise-cracking gunslinger (Steve McQueen's character), Goodnight (Hawke) a former sharpshooter, Billy (Lee) a knife-master, Vasquez (Garcia-Rulfo) the Mexican, Red Harvest (Sensmeier) the Comanche and Horne (D'Onofrio) - the best character - as the mountain man. Still no real motivation for them to help the town is given, but let's go with it anyway. Sarsgaard is good as Bogue, infusing him with plenty of contempt and no empathy. Bennett is OK, but mostly a token female character.Does what a good Western should - plenty of shoot-outs, sweeping vistas, explosions, horses riding and jumping, staring from under hat brims, and a healthy death toll! Has a few slow points in the first half, but the battle for the final 30min or so is done very well. Doesn't necessarily add to the original, but nor does it do it a disservice. A straight-down-the-line 3.5."
" A Magnificently Diverse Seven
",2017-12-24 00:00:00,7,"Possibly inspired by the successful remakes, or better said, retakes on the classic westerns ""True Grit"" and ""3:10 to Yuma,"" director Antoine Fuqua's ""The Magnificent Seven"" is an appealing take on the 1960 classic, which starred Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Eli Wallach, Robert Vaughn, and James Coburn. Fuqua's version cannot compete with the John Sturges original in star power; Denzel Washington is the only cast member in the same league with Brynner, McQueen, Bronson, and Coburn. However, the film boasts a few fine supporting players like Peter Sarsgaard as the slimey Bartholomew Bogue, who is out to ruthlessly grab land from under a town of peaceful God-fearing homesteaders; Sarsgaard is only missing a black mustache to twirl as the personification of the Bad Guy. Vincent D'Onofrio is colorful as Jack Horne, whose girth nearly qualifies the film to be ""The Magnificent Seven and a Half,"" and Ethan Hawke is fine as Goodnight Robicheaux, a gambler with issues and a Chinese sidekick. 
Led by an African-American law officer, Fuqua's seven are an almost comically diverse group of strays that reflect today's America far more than the earlier cast. Denzel Washington is Chisholm, who is enlisted by the beleaguered townspeople, headed by a strong-willed widow, Emma Cullen, played by Haley Bennett. Reluctantly accepting the challenge to rid the town of Bogue, Chisholm assembles a motley crew that includes a Comanche Indian with a Mohawk haircut, the Chinese sidekick, an overweight senior citizen, the aforementioned widow, a Mexican, a Confederate veteran, and a hunky white guy played by Chris Pratt. These magnificent seven are about as politically correct as any central casting could conceive.Inspired by Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai,"" the story is simple, straightforward, and familiar. Penned by Nic Pizzolatto and Richard Wenk, the film arguably lingers too long on the introductory sequences for each character. However, the threads pull together and lead to an effective action-packed climax, which is fun, but as implausible as is the assembly of such a diverse group of gun people on the late-19th-century frontier. The film features a fine score by the late James Horner, but the iconic Elmer Bernstein theme is missed, although heard briefly over the closing credits. With Washington as a solid lead, ""The Magnificent Seven"" is an above-average western remake that just misses the high marks hit by ""True Grit"" and ""3:10 to Yuma,"" but remains entertaining nevertheless."
" Solid if unmemorable western
",2017-12-06 00:00:00,7,"Rating7/10This is a solid if unmemorable western, a remake of the original film which itself was an American take on the 1957 Kurusawa masterpiece. Sarsgaard isn't very imposing as the villain. Denzel is OK as are the rest of the cast. D'Onofrio is the acting standout here creating a memorable character in just a few scenes. Overviolent at times but an early standoff builds the tension nicely.Worth watching7/10"
" The Not so Magnificent Seven
",2017-11-21 00:00:00,5,"A remake of a great film that is a remake of an even greater film (Akira Kurosawa's 'Seven Samurai'), there are worse remakes out there than 2016's 'The Magnificent Seven'. Primarily 'Psycho', 'The Wicker Man', 'Rollerball', 'Ghostbusters' and 'Stepford Wives'.'The Magnificent Seven' has its strengths but fails to live up to its title and one does question the point of it. It is well made visually, with an atmospherically gritty look and an evocative setting. Some of the action excites and the direction has a dark grit that is typical of Antoine Fuqua. While it is nowhere near as unforgettable or as iconic as one of film's all time great scores, James Horner's score here is demonstrative of what a great talent he was and how his tragic far too early death is still a sad loss.Casting is very variable, some of the acting is very good, some of it doesn't work. The best performances come from Denzel Washington, charismatic as ever, Ethan Hawke excelling in an atypical role and Haley Bennett mixing toughness and vulnerability adeptly. The most interesting character relationship is between Washington and Hawke and gives the film the few glimpses of realism and substance. Lee Byung-hun is also good fun.Others don't fare so well, not helped by that most of the characters are not that interesting and sketchily developed. Didn't think either Chris Pratt or Vincent D'Onofrio, both decent and more in other things, fitted particularly well, Pratt especially jarred and his humorous lines lack wit and don't gel. Faring the worst is Peter Sarsgaard, who just isn't sinister or intense enough, even in a severely underwritten role he looks like he's sleepwalking.While there's a lot of blood and violence, there is little soul or heart underneath and some of it is gratuitous. The dialogue is awkward, particularly the humour which falls flat and often feels misplaced. The story suffers from an overlong length, a sluggish pace, a lack of tension or suspense and heavy-handed and pointless political elements. Won't carp about the political correctness like some have but it doesn't add anything. The illogical and anaemic ending underwhelms drastically as well.In summary, has its strengths but not so magnificent and one does question the point of it. 5/10 Bethany Cox"

",2017-11-12 00:00:00,3,"There was a guy: Akira Kurosawa. He made some films. Many of them were outstanding. Who cares. Millenials cannot relate to ""outstanding"". What we want to do is take Kurosawa's basic story, but turn it into ""DIVERSITY HIRE 7"". Millenials can relate to DIVERSITY HIRES. They've had that BS shoved down their throats for the last 20 years. Then we're going to make sure the DIVERSITY HIRE 7 have no more depth & as much bluster as any ""COMIC BOOK 7"" would have. Millenials can relate to COMIC BOOK movies. They've also had those shoved down their throats for the last 20 years. But we're not done yet. We have to make sure to give zero reason why any of these COMIC BOOK CHARACTERS would possibly join the ""7"". Give a reason & the millennials may have to ""think"". Millenials hate to think. OK, almost done. To top it off, the leader, the #1 of the 7. Denzel. We make his character an amalgam of Clint Eastwood characters. That way, if any non-millennials watch this film they'll feel a faint familiarity. Oh wait, will the familiarity breed contempt?"
" Very entertaining.
",2017-11-05 00:00:00,10,"We totally enjoyed it. You don't have to include gore to get your point across.This film leaves some things to the imagination.I'm not a professional film critic, so I don't not pick every little detail of a movie.I just want to be entertained and this movie did that for me and my husband. Just my opinion."
" Interesting take on a classic.
",2017-10-15 00:00:00,6,"This version does a good job with the action and develops some of the characters pretty well. There are a few interesting twists, but some of them detract rather than add to the movie. Several of the best elements that made the original Magnificent Seven stand out were left out of this movie. I think Yul Brenner's character & acting worked better than Denzelle Washington's. Pratt & McQueen's characters a dead draw, both added a great deal to the movie. Lee is an interesting replacement for Coburn. Both brought some character to the movies. Lee however got far less screen time. Hawke is a major upgrade in both character & acting over Vaughn's role. This is one of the few places the newer version really outshines the original. Dropping the Chico character (Bucholz) I feel took some of the charm out of the movie and killed the core message of the movie. Instead of redemption the movie becomes simple revenge. Losing Bronson's character (O'Reilly) also degraded the plot of the original as well as the flow of the movie. Sensemeir's character was interesting but couldn't make up for the loss of the other two. Horne's (D'Ofornoro) character was also interesting, and provided my favorite line of the movie (the bear comment), but didn't really replace the connection people made with the two lost characters. Grime's Teddy Q character was a positive addition, though it couldn't really make up for the losses. Bennet's character was an interesting addition and underlined the change from redemption to revenge. She played the role well, though the script was a mixed bag with her character. The action was better done in the remake, the villain however less believable even though he was well played. The script just made him a 50s type bad guy, very 2 dimensional. The plot also fails in realism. Too much of an attempt to rehash already overworked anti-corporate themes. Made parts of the movie into a tired cliché. The villain in the original was believable and you could empathize with him some. Wallach did a good job with the role. This is a movie worth watching but it really fails to add to a classic and probably should not have been named the Magnificent Seven as it does not hold up to the greatness of the original. Given a different name I'd probably upped the movie a star despite it's obvious theft of ideas from the Magnificent Seven. It cannot really be called the same movie as it only shares a few ideas with the original plot. Seven warriors protect a town, beyond that there is little in common with the original. It is closer to the movie that inspired the Magnificent Seven (Seven Samarai) but again missed the core ideas of that movie as well. This becomes cheapened by the base motivations of the movie. A soulless imitation that never understood what made those two movies great much less continued the classic tale that enthralled audiences over the years."
" A western classic with some added Denzel Washington
",2017-10-02 00:00:00,7,"Once upon a time, there was this bloody western titled The Magnificent Seven"", released in 1960 and directed by legendary Sergio Leone, which is still considered one of the best movies western genre, it not of all time. It won't probably hit you that hard, if you tried to watch now for the first time, what with it being almost 60 years old and all. So you might as well settle for this remake. This is one of those remakes nobody asked for, but you know it's gonna be somewhat special if it's led by Denzel Washington, one of the greatest movie stars of our time, a man with not often rivalled charisma and on screen presence. It's about seven gunmen protecting a town from ruthless robber baron, simple as that. The story or screenplay are nothing special nor especially deep, but they don't even have to be, because the cast is cool and most of the time is dedicated to blasting off those guns. The direction is competent, able to use the best of western clichés and build constant suspense; dialogue is adequate; the acting is good enough but there's no point of writing about all that extensively. First and foremost, this is about shooting people, or preparing to do it, for 132 minutes. Although the story is shallow, there is some hidden symbolism which may offer some delight for Jung fans. The seven heroes are played by Byung-hun Lee, Chris Pratt, Denzel Washington, Ethan Hawke, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Martin Sensmeier, and Vincent D'Onofrio. The robber baron is Peter Sarsgaard. Also appearing, Luke Grimes, Haley Bennett, et al. Most of the cast plays it straight but some (Hawke, D'Onofrio, Sarsgaard) add a little mental instability to their performances, which brings a welcome variety. For a movie directed by Antoine Fuqua, The Magnificent Seven"" is unusually modest and low-key – if you can call a story of massacre that. It never tries to get glamorous and impress us with visual inventiveness, the latter is mostly reserved for shootouts so we wouldn't have to watch men dying in same way over and over again. Then again, the world looks remarkably simple and unglamorous as the true wild west may hav been, Washington, for example, hasn't looked that ordinary on screen for a long time. So, this is a simple story well told. Fine entertainment for action lovers, or those who want to see classic western redone with modern tools and resources."
" completely misses the point
",2017-09-24 00:00:00,4,"The original is an all-time classic for good reasons. Not only does it have a cast full of film icons, but it follows a can't miss plot line taken from The Seven Samurai and brings genuine emotion and meaning to the proceedings. The hired gunfighters each have their reasons and there is an underlying sadness to go along with the concepts of pride and honor and heroism and desperation.This remake has zero subtleties, gives the characters no motivation and makes the villain comically evil. There isn't an honest note to be found and it turns into nothing but a vengeance shoot 'em up.It is an insult to film buffs that this movie is even using the same name. Think of all the great human moments in the original. Comforting the dying Harry by telling him that there really was loads of gold. Robert Vaughn's character talking about living in a a corner of a storeroom. Or this exchangeBoy: We're ashamed to live here. Our fathers are cowards. O'Reilly: Don't you ever say that again about your fathers, because they are not cowards. You think I am brave because I carry a gun; well, your fathers are much braver because they carry responsibility, for you, your brothers, your sisters, and your mothers. And this responsibility is like a big rock that weighs a ton. It bends and it twists them until finally it buries them under the ground. And there's nobody says they have to do this. They do it because they love you, and because they want to. I have never had this kind of courage. Running a farm, working like a mule every day with no guarantee anything will ever come of it. This is bravery. That's why I never even started anything like that... that's why I never will. The bad guy in the original was still human, had logical reasons for his behavior and of course was played by the great Eli Wallach. In this one he's a joke.I'm actually mad at Denzel for lending his credibility to this"
" I seek righteousness but will settle for revenge
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,10,"This is for the 2016 film. I am saying this because Amazon has a way of combining film reviews with the same title.The beginning of the film starts off with the conflict: Evil frackers, er ah miners poisoning the water for the farmers. They are lead by robber baron Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) who gives us an early speech...America=democracy=capitalism=God...which is the limit of subliminal political message. After killing a few farmers, widow Cullen (Haley Bennett) seeks out help. Chisolm (Denzel Washington) agrees and assembles a group of skilled killers to go up against Bogue's army of men.The plot is rather a simple western formula. In this case it is the characters that made the film worth watching. Personally I would have preferred a flamboyant Samuel L. Jackson type quoting Isiah over the more classy Denzel, but that is just me. Film had a few memorable lines and scenes. A must for western fans.Guide: No swearing, sex, or nudity."
" Great adaptation for today's PC culture
",2017-09-23 00:00:00,1,"Not only is the dialog and action limp in this terrible remake of a great western (based off a great Japanese flick by Kurosawa), the filmmakers had to dig a deeper hole by making it so politically correct that the joy of watching the film is all but destroyed. Of course the evil guy says ""Capitalism is great and god is great, so you must love capitalism or you're against god"" or some complete idiocy like that. 90 million dollars spent on a brainless, lifeless, unwatchable mess (I could not sit through the whole thing because I'm not into masochism). Hollywood should get wise to the fact that their world is the fantasy, and we, the people, live in the reality."
" The first part showed great promise; the last part was a disappointment
",2017-09-22 00:00:00,2,"I wanted to watch this movie as soon as I heard it was going to be released in the theaters. Very disappointing. First, the good: Denzel Washington is very appropriately scary and compelling. He makes the 'do it because it needs doing' set-up ALMOST work. His character is allowed a little bit of depth, in that he knows who the guys are that he wants, and gets them. Chris Platt has the best role because he has the best lines, and carries it off so very, very well. His actions during the bar scene, in shutting down the bad guys who would interfere with Denzel, give his character depth, which is furthered by his card tricks, two GREAT scenes talking about his guns, and the leprechaun scene is just brilliant. If ONLY the last part of the film had been as good as the first part! I say it again: Platt has great lines: ""You will be murdered by the world's greatest lover."" Vincent D'Onofrio doesn't have as many good lines as Washington and Platt, but he still manages to play a wonderful character. Even in his death scene, I pulled for the guy, because he was such a diamond in the rough. I don't know the actor who played Billy Rocks, but he had some good scenes to work with. His care for Ethan Hawke's character showed as being a real thing, and the scene where he was trying to teach the townsmen how to knife fight was excellent, both in his fighting ability and his frustration. The not-good: nobody else had ANYTHING to work with. Ethan Hawke's character perhaps had a LITTLE, but not enough for him to do anything with. He intimidates a drunken cowboy with his reputation, has a decent scene while getting a shave, hints at nightmares, and that's it. I didn't care if he came back for the fight or not. The other characters had zip to work with, although the actors playing Red Harvest and Vasquez did what they could, there just wasn't anything there. The BAD, awful, horrid: Leading off with a political rant about capitalism? In a WESTERN? Are you CRAZY? Who does that? Bad, bad move, because it is so artificial and contrived; takes you right out of the mood. And the bad guy has no justification whatsoever for wanting to take the town over.Second, and perhaps even worse than lead-off scene, because it is done to a hero, and not a villain: Haley Bennett, playing widowed Emma Cullen, shows up to recruit Denzel Washington, DAYS after her beloved husband is shot, with her DRESS pulled off of her shoulders! That would NEVER have happened, it is fraudulent, needless exploitation of her sexuality, and it doesn't even contribute to the development of the plot! If you look at the costumes worn by the other women in the film, you will see that only the hookers are wearing revealing clothing; the other FARMERS' WIVES and company are dressed in period appropriate clothing. True, it is only in the scene where she meets Denzel that she has her shoulders exposed, but it's a BIG violation. It actually made me wonder whether she had immediately turned to prostitution, or was trying a Honey Trap on Denzel, but if so, that wasn't revealed in the rest of the story line. It was a BAD decision, and I hope to find that someone else raises it as an issue. Third, Denzel Washington's character had a STRONG backstory tie in with the villain, Brogue, and that is never even HINTED at until the very end; at that point, it's wasted. There is no hint of his motivation for taking the contract earlier, and thus no suspense. Either give us a clue that something's going on (along the lines of ""she would be your sister's age,"" but tied into the plot) or leave it out. It's just pasted on the end with chewed pink bubble gum, and has less flavor. Conclusion: Someone else mentioned that the final shoot-out took twenty minutes. That really was excessive; cut it down to five minutes, and give the other fifteen to character development, and the film becomes a valid 'Magnificent 7'. I do have great fondness for the previous works; I actually own a copy of 'The Seven Samurai' on DVD. However, I don't think that the comparison with the originals were the ONLY reasons I downrated the movie."
" Unnecessary
",2017-09-19 00:00:00,4,The filming and some of the acting is good. All the rest is Extremely bad.This is just an action movie written very bad.The script and the way story develops makes no sense. If you want to watch some shooting where the goods have 100% efficiency and the bad guys are fully predictable watch this.This remake was totally unnecessary.
" Weak and disappointing
",2017-09-17 00:00:00,5,"I had some expectations on this film. I saw Fuqua to be good once, it features some of my favourite actors like Ethan Hawke or sometimes good Chris Pratt. But... No, this film is no good.It lacks action, it has no character's development, it has no logic in its evolution. Even likable characters or reasonably well-made jokes are absent. Or drama. Anything is bleak! Even picturesque landscapes looked false on that senseless dramatic background. Just once for the whole film I could have some senses for characters and this was only because of music (nothing special also apart from one or two episodes)."
" Why do they insist on remaking classics?
",2017-09-15 00:00:00,2,"I won't comment on the political correctness, enough others have done that already. The cast was good but they did not have the persona of the 1960 film. How could they possibly hope to capture the panache of the original cast? There is only one word to describe Yul Brenner, Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn and Charles Bronson and that word is Cool. The new cast did not have the same stage presence and their parts appeared strained. In deciding to do a remake of this nature, there is an awfully high bar to hit. The script and cast came nowhere near that level. You can't swap action for personality."
" Doesn't Hold a Candle to the Original
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,4,"Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen, stars of the 1960 version of this film, are without equals. Although Denzel is very good, his character is too much of a superhero to be taken seriously. As for the rest of the ""Seven"", it's only D'onornio who shines through with any acting honors, as everyone else is miscast. As for the movie plot itself, it simply steals ideas and characters from several other films i.e., Hawkes' mimics Dennis Quaid's ""Doc Holliday"" character, and the rest of the cast appears to be based upon the sturdy western, ""The Professionals"", right down to the bow and arrow expert. In short, there is nothing new or creative here, just more of the over the top, unbelievable special effects, such as the Seven never missing a shot against the baddies. In the original, you cared about the Seven, all of them, and were hoping against hope none of them would die. In this pale remake, their characters are so undefined you just don't care. And by the way, no one could have matched the depth of Eli Wallach's characterization of the antagonist."
" Well-acted retelling of the classic spaghetti western of the same name knows what it is and successfully delivers the goods it promises
",2017-09-10 00:00:00,7,"The heroes of this shoot-em-up western action vehicle are in deed magnificent, but perhaps that is too strong of a word to describe the film as a whole. The Magnificent Seven, a remake of the 1960 classic of the same name which; itself, happens to be remake of another Japanese classic titled 'Seven Samuri' by Akira Kurosawa, is a lively take on the western genre. Scorching of charisma and elastic appeal of its well-rounded male cast, this delivers exactly what is promises if nothing more. And kudos go to director Antoine Fuqua, veteran of the action genre, on breathing life into the progressively dwindling genre, even if the film is not inspiring. After all, there is plenty to be pleased about watching a cast of A- listers get wired up in a violent shoot-em-up frenzy as they come face-to-face with the evildoers against justice. Although Fuqua never aims for anything grand in depth, his execution bears solid evidence that he knows how to have fun with the genre, as does the cast. Set in 1879, this film follows African-American gunslinger Sam Chisolm (played by Denzel Washington) who is rallies up a group of outlaws consisting of bar gambler Josh Farraday (played by Chris Pratt), Southern gunslinger Goodnight Robicheaux (played by Ethan Hawke), his Asian sidekick Billy Rocks (played by Byung Hun-Lee), Native American explorer Jack Horne (played by Vincent D'Onofrio), Mexican hunter Vasquez (played by Manuel Garcia-Rulfo), and an Indian archer nicknamed Red Harvest (played by Martin Sensmaier). Together, these courageous outlaws prepare for a fight against a league of bandits lead by the ruthless Bartholomew Bogue (played by Peter Sarsguard) who has threatened the poor villagers of the old town of Red Grove including young mistress Emma Cullen (played by Haley Bennett) who watches as her husband is murdered in cold blood.What Antoine Fuqua brings to this loud western vehicle is more about stimulating the adrenaline than challenging viewers with a cerebral- generated story. As an old-fashioned spaghetti western action flick, this movie certainly delivers while not taking itself too seriously. But it does it add anything new that we haven't already seen in the genre? Definitely not. But with a filmmaker like Fuqua capitalizing on snappy action set pieces and occasional bursts of clutch humor and dialogue to the already not-too-serious tone, the movie accomplishes what it sets out to be -- nothing more, nothing less. Reasonably- paced and brutally faithful to the genre, the movie takes wide advantage of its PG-13 rating with an excess of loud gun shootouts, especially in the final sequence when Fuqua unleashes a full throttle of sound and fury as our heroes face up against Peter Sarsguard and his evil minions in a violent shoot-em- up parade. Things only get heated when the antagonist pulls out a gatling gun and showers the old town in a wild orgy of bullets and explosions rippling through the buildings. But what about the cast? Consisting of a racially diverse plethora of well to moderately-known actors, this film makes a fortune feat of allowing these actors to show out their charisma. Denzel Washington, a newcomer to the western genre, is fabulous. Chris Pratt is appealing as usual, nothing too surprising. Ethan Hawk, reuniting with Washington after their first collaboration in Fuqua's 'Training Day' back in 2001, has his moments. Peter Sarsguard gives an ingenious portrayal as the villain with a gritty magnitude. Vincent D'Onofrio, Byung Hun-Lee, Martin Sensmaier, and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo are decent in their roles, but nothing too memorable. After all, none of these actors are particularly going for the gold. But is important is they appear to be having just as much fun as we do while the film last. And shoutout to the late James Horner who composes a fantastic score to suit the western atmosphere. The Magnificent Seven is a solid western remake of its classic source material gifts full display on sweet performances, pulse- pounding action set pieces, and a blissful taste of the western genre. Sure, this movie leaves no landmark nor should it be expected to. But for what it accomplishes, be prepared for have a good time while you watch as the actors leave their guns blazing."
" MAGnificent 7: what could have been
",2017-08-26 00:00:00,3,"I love the original magnificent 7 1960 its what made me love cowboys as a little kid, i even watched the original seven samurai it was based on, despite the magnificent 7 being a remake of the seven samurai, it still had its own story that felt awe inspiring & different, that made it a classic. Magnificent 7 2016 is nothing like it, its not even a shot for shot remake, they tried to recreate a new story but failed. i loved the idea of multiple ethnic characters, i don't think denzel made much difference, but a native American and Japanese sword fighter being apart of the team, that sounded amazing. i was actually hoping they were going to somehow fuse the 2 movies together, like samurai and cowboys and Indians! even having a girl apart of the team sounded cool. but they made everything awkward, instead of the story being about a bunch of anti-heroes/ misfits who are only helping because of money but learning how to be real heroes at the end, there was no character development whatsoever, each of the 7 just joined without hesitation, also when they introduced the 7 in the original they made each one of them recognizable and interesting, the 2016 7 were awkward introductions and did not convince me at all that they were right for the job. the girl could have been more interesting, if she was the outlaw i would have been impressed, her husbands death was also cliché. And the villain, i hated this guy he was boring and pathetic, even his joker speech at the beginning was boring,i was thinking how cool it would have been if the leader was like an ex samurai, just to be a shout out to 7 samurai. And i don't have a problem with a bunch of nicely dressed, white bandits, but the original had Mexican bandits, in fact a Mexican village, in that one the people had no choice to leave and that's why they seemed more desperate, in this one half the town left, there was no reason for anyone to stay. Denzels almost nonexistent revenge was boring, even the always cool Chris Pratt,had a final scene more cringy than his GoG dance battle. This had potential, i blame the writers for no originality and editors for awkward transitions,this movie is still watchable, but is still a bad remake, i hope Denzel and Chris Pratt can work together again,though."
" Awful - beyond the pale
",2017-08-21 00:00:00,3,"Zero momentum... zero quality. The colours look drab, this has the feel of a cheap documentary and the main characters just seem to be speaking their lines with no pzazz. I could only watch about half an hour and i felt so cheated I stopped watching. This is another Ghostbusters 3 experience where the took a classic and for no good reason try to remake it and make it seems the amateur dramatics got their hands on it. AVOID."
" Not so magnificent
",2017-08-17 00:00:00,3,As others have said it is ALL shoot em up. Big stars do not help this shine. I gotta check out the old one was it also tedious? This one met my expectations which were low.

" Not about the 7 dwarfs
",2017-08-12 00:00:00,3,"The magnificent 7 is a strange movie. It is a western, which does not make any sense given we thought this movie was a movie about the magnificent 7 dwarfs but clearly the title was misleading. There was however one leprechaun in the movie but he was unfortunately not one of the 7 dwarfs. The movie turned out not to be a Cinderella spin off at all and by the end we weren't even sure what had happened as we were too busy trying to find the 7 dwarfsOverall a promising title with 0 relation to the movie"
" Rating: A
",2017-08-06 00:00:00,9,"I just checked the percentage on Rotten Tomatoes for this movie and I'm blown away by the huge number of negative and mixed reviews for this film! I had so much fun with this remake, I think Antoine Fuqua directed it brilliantly, the action scenes are amazing and all of the characters are either funny and charming or total badass.There is so much to praise about Fuqua's work: the beautiful wide shots, the awesome shootouts and action sequences, the adequate pacing, the suspense, ... I don't think he missed a single thing, everything is on point! The beginning is shot amazingly, the first act's pacing is so well controlled (especially when you have seven major characters to introduce the audience to and he does it brilliantly, it's always exciting to meet each member of the group) and the ending is breathtaking. Great job, I can't wait to watch more movies from him!The action scenes are delightful. God, they're so good. Extremely well shot, a lot of amazing shootouts, great suspense and, when you have characters that you care about, it gets even better. There are scenes that I'm sure I'm going to watch constantly through these next weeks and it's a film that is highly watchable due to his super funny side.The cast is so captivating. Denzel Washington plays the role he was born to: badass. He carries this film in such an awesome way, I dare you to take your eyes off him while watching this masterpiece. Chris Pratt is the funny guy and who else could have played someone like Josh Faraday? I literally laughed out loud in the first scene he was in and I kept doing that until the very end, even if he did get too ""modern"". Ethan Hawke portrays Goodnight Robicheaux, a character I was really intrigued by due to his past that kept tormenting him. He's the one with more depth to him, but my only issue with this movie is based exactly on that. Depth. And the lack of character's development.As I said before, all of the cast does a great job with the amazing characters that they have. However, some should have definitely been better explored: Goodnight is the main one, he has so much to tell from his past, but I never got to truly understand why he's feeling so scared and traumatized; Jack Horne (portrayed perfectly by Vincent D'Onofrio, one of the most underrated actors currently) and Billy Rocks (Byung-hun Lee) are my favorites when it came to action scenes, but they didn't receive that much attention. Finally, Vasquez (Manuel Garcia-Rulfo) and Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier) are the odd ones out: a wanted Mexican and a warrior from a Hindu tribe that, besides the beginning where their characters are introduced, they don't show up that often (even if Red Harvest is awesome in the few scenes he's in). Peter Sarsgaard does a slightly over-the-top performance, but it's still a good enough villain for this movie.The Magnificent Seven never tried to be something that it's not, it stayed constantly funny, captivating, thrilling and action-packed with amazing direction, a great cast and badass characters. Definitely, the movie that western needed!MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)"
" A modern western
",2017-08-03 00:00:00,7,"They really make far too few Westerns these days, so a remake of one of the real classic ones is one step forward. A village beset by a en evil rogue landowner, who aim to drive all the villagers away, to enhance his own fortune. The desperate villagers hire some gunslingers to save their village, and of course, everything comes down to a huge fight. A classic Western-story, straight forward and full of action. And this is both the strength and weakness.When you watch a Western you want the gunfights, the action. And this movie is packed with it. There are quite few different fights and stand offs, from the classic duel to the massive shootouts.In addition, the casting is excellent. Each of the seven is a good pick, and you mustn't forget Bennet as Emma or Saarsgard as the bad guy Bogue. They each bring another dimension to their characters, but you only get a hint of it. Unfortunately there is too little time given to exploring them. There are hints of really interesting stories in the past, how these characters came to be and came to know each other. But we get only glimpses of it. Had they managed to work more of that into the story, without losing too much of the pace, this would be another Classic. It would be Magnificent.Unfortunately it is not. It is a highly paced, action packed, very entertaining Western. But it left a little too much hidden.7/10"
" Middle of the road adaption, with modern action sequencing.
",2017-08-01 00:00:00,6,"This remake of The Magnificent Seven is bogged down by some weird vibe I had trouble putting my finger on. Overall it should have been great,but left me underwhelmed.I thought that maybe my memories of the original had been brightened by youth and time, so I went back and re-watched it.And while watching the original it hit me. The characters in this remake are simply poorly defined and with little depth. Hell, even their appearance was similar, with this modern trend of half whiskers/stubble, tending to help blend the characters as well.In the original every character was brightly defined and very individual.With this new one I found I ended up not really caring about them at all. The one with potential was Ethan Hawkes character, but they whipped past his death as if it were nothing.In the end I think it really comes down to knowing the art of good story telling.The original did it extremely well and told us a grand tale of interesting folks. This new one did it less well and told us about some things some guys did."
" An OK but unnecessary remake
",2017-07-27 00:00:00,7,"The original 'Magnificent Seven' (1960) is currently regarded as a classic of the genre (although at the time of release, critics were not so impressed), so why bother making a remake? The producers had a solid cast and should have just make a 'new' movie (cashing in on name recognition seems pointless as most people who value the name just gripe about the perceived inferiority of the remake). The 2016 version is not a bad revenge-oater – the cast and script are fine, the movie has the grittiness that appeals to modern audiences, the body count is high, the heroes' shooting skills preposterous (nothing new in that of course), and the music OK (little can compare to Bernstein's legendary 1960 score). The plausibility of the movie suffers a bit as one bullet or arrow will dispatch a bad guy but good guys seem to be able to stagger toward a dramatic end regardless of how many times they're shot. The real weakness in this film is the chief villain, Peter Sarsgaard's 'Bartholomew Bogue' character (presumably representing the evils of unrestrained capitalism), who is played as a murderous, psychotic nut job. Eli Wallach's ""Calvera"" character in the original was much more interesting and plausible (as westerns go) - you could almost sympathise with him at the end, when he tries to understand why the seven gunfighters whom he saw as being hard men like himself, would come back and defend the farmers who had betrayed them (an interesting plot twist absent in the remake). These kinds of nuances are lacking in the 2016 version – the bad guys are so inhuman and abhorrent that slaughtering them is both justified and desirable (but bloodless, a problem with PG action movies). Overall: the story's a classic and the remake, although not as good as the original, is entertaining enough to warrant a viewing."

Even when your'e riding toward a bunch of these types unloading there rifles some bullets will hit but you'll just say ouch and carry on riding Makes Die Hard look like tinker tailor. quite the worst annoying film I have seen this year"
" Very good movie.
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this movie. I don't know why it has gotten such bad reviews from other viewers. It had action, comedy, great actors and an interesting plot. I was not a fan of the original movie, so perhaps that is why I enjoyed this version. It is a film made for the 21st century so of course, it will have a diverse cast and that is what made it fun. Watch it for yourself, without the original in mind, and you will find that it's a fine movie in its own right."

" Dull, sanitised, unexciting western flop
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,2,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In the mid west, the small town of Rose Creek finds itself under attack from ruthless industrialist Bartholemew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard), who wants them to sell it to him so he can build a railroad through it. It all seems pretty hopeless, until a mysterious stranger named Chisolm (Denzel Washington) rolls into town. Proving himself adept at handling himself in tough situations, Chisolm rallies the towns-people, including loose cannon Faraday (Chris Pratt), avowed pacifist Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke), oriental blade master Billy (Byung-hun Lee) and Haley (Emma Cullen), whose husband was killed by Bogue, to rise up and take down their oppressor, while containing a secret vengeance of his own.The western genre has certainly risen back up again, and holds a more popular place in modern audiences hearts than it did maybe, fifteen years ago, and so this remake of The Magnificent Seven certainly had a lot of potential riding on it. But the first thing to strike you is the befuddling 12A certificate, in a time when Quentin Tarantino has made them as bloody and brutal as anything else, with his offerings The Hateful Eight and Django Unchained both gaining 18 certificates. What's even more perplexing is, this is another collaboration between Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua, the team behind the ultra violent Equalizer and Training Day. But then this is just a precursor for a film obsessed with political correctness and not offending any sensibilities, with a multi cultural line up of lead characters and one woman which even though I haven't seen the original film, I just know wouldn't have been conceived of when it first came out.When westerns were all the rage maybe sixty years ago, pretty simplistic plots were enough to drive them forward, but in a more modern time when people expect a little more, this kind of thing needs a little more meat on the bones, and there's just nothing here to give it any extra kick. What results is a dull, tepid film that plods on for nearly two hours and engages your attention none the more, and just wastes the combined talents of an all star cast that really deserve better. Denzel feels cheapened, like he's sold himself short, and a supporting line up including the likes of Pratt and Hawke don't make things any better. Sarsgaard is also a really flat, dull villain.It doesn't take a genius to see this is a little bit of a passion project for Fuqua, like he obviously had a personal affection for the original film, and maybe loved it as a kid. You just have to wonder, given his record of brutal, pull no punches filmmaking, why he produced something as lily livered and boring as this. Not so much The Magnificent Seven as The Magnanimous One. *"
" Good old-fashioned western of good vs evil
",2017-06-18 00:00:00,7,"I really liked The Magnificent Seven remake starring Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt. There's the evil rich guy Bogue who brutally demonstrates how he has no heart to the town of Rose Creek. He's wringing the life out of the town by blasting the gold from their hills and ripping the financial heart from the town for personal gains.A young woman Emma is spurred to action and goes in search of men to help protect what's left of her town. She meets up with Denzel and slowly, the Magnificent Seven team gets formed. It's a suicide mission, but still these guys seem confident. The town joins together. It's the typical Western where Clint would walk in and exact justice for wrongdoing. Except it's got 7 different guys who form this loose alliance. I loved Vincent Donofrio's old bear-like character who seemed indestructible. A native American, an Asian guy with knives, a Mexican guy, it was like a UN of vagabonds who all seemed to be ready to go out doing something good for once.Sure it's a Hollywood ending, but what a great fun ride. I enjoyed The Magnificent Seven's self-deprecating humor, while facing the seriousness of survival of good over evil. I highly recommend The Magnificent Seven. Enjoy."
" Fantasy western.
",2017-06-16 00:00:00,3,"Ancient revolvers that shoot accurately over one hundred meters and a gatling gun that not only shoots over eight hundred meters but also with pin-point accuracy and bows that shoot arrows with poor penetration. Yes, not a bad fantasy film as far as comedies go. I recommend researching the 'wild west' to any producer who wished to show an authentic account of firearms in the nineteenth century and their accuracy not to mention the penetrating power of an Indian hunting bow."
" Great Modern Remake of an Old Classic
",2017-06-13 00:00:00,9,"This remake of the original movie, has the right mix of familiar faces, on-screen chemistry, humor, gun fights and action. Intriguing character connections makes me wish there would be a spin off series diving into the character's individual stories more in depth. Bogue, the villain, is despised from the opening of the movie and one only hopes there will be some type of ""reckoning."" A great mix of the classic battle of good versus evil, the tycoon vs the commoner, the lengths that greed and corruption will take a person, and those good men who are willing to fight for those less fortunate. This version is even better than the original. The cast gels, the scenery is stunning, and the Seven are all experts in their craft---the killing of bad guys. A great western!""I seek righteousness, as should we all. But in this case I'll take revenge."""
" Horrible Re-Make of a Great Original Western
",2017-06-12 00:00:00,1,"Hollywood needs to quit remaking classic westerns. This ""PC"" (politically correct version of the Magnificent Seven is truly horrible. The acting is weak at best, the cast is not remotely believable, the costuming is less than stunning, many of the camera shots and angles are just annoying and strange looking. There is absolutely nothing zero zilch redeemable about this movie a total waste of time and money to make a horrible film when there's a beautiful original."
" Update
",2017-06-06 00:00:00,6,"Obviously we have a very skilled director at work and some very fine actors here too. One of the main ""stars"" of the original though was the music. And while watching it the first time, I could only distinguish the title song once during the movie. A friend of mine who watched it several times confirmed though that the theme was woven into it more than that, just a bit more subtle, than I personally would like.Then again, when the music hits you (for the second time) during the credits, it's something that may give you goosebumps. Especially if you are aware of the original movie and soundtrack. Having said all that, the movie has many different characters, all helping out for various reasons, all in different stages of their lives. Politically correct when it comes to having cowboys from different backgrounds then.The action is very well shot and the theme still works more than neatly. A good old western then .. just new"

",2017-05-31 00:00:00,9,"i just watched this movie recently - one of the best westerns - i think it is as good if not better than the original. i have always loved blood and guts westerns - ever since i first saw ""The Wild Bunch"". this one is right up there with the modern western - good guys verses the bad guys. the bad guy in this movie is really mean and you can't wait until he is dead. the ending is done well also - it is a little long but well worth the time to watch. one of the best modern westerns i have seen in awhile.take some time and watch this one - you will like it!!!"
" The Forgettable Seven
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,5,"I still hold to the belief that there's still a market for Westerns - even in this day and age - just not passable ones. And I also know that there are considerations to be made when viewing a remake. But they didn't have to call this ""The Magnificent Seven"", either. This is a notable cast, but isn't a patch on the original. Of these players, I found Ethan Hawke to have the most depth, while Chris Pratt (though enjoyable) an awkward fit; Denzel's just being Denzel. It's like the other four guys are also-rans.It's a long-winded film with an awkward buildup to the big face-off; an engagement that's choreographed and cut to shreds before devolving into a series of boss battles.There's no glossing over this letdown.5/10"
" Hollywood Ruins Theme
",2017-05-28 00:00:00,2,"I saw the first five minutes of the 2016 Magnificent Seven. I turned it off. I hate it when Hollywood re-writes the theme that only applies to leftist liberals. The original bad guys were plainly bandits who bullied a town. See all the old movie versions. Today, this town is fighting the 'evil corporate guy.' He's a mine owner who walks slow and has an Army of mean white males. Normally, small towns are thrilled to have a corporate guy who brings jobs. Keep the movie at plain old bandits. Don't trying to give a message like a Liberal Democratic Senator. Besides, Hollywood is corporate. They make millions. The hypocrisy is clear, too."
" Incompetent Remake

Denzel was a poor choice for the leader of the pack, his acting was mediocre at best. No depth to the character at all. Chris Pratt really added nothing to the movie at all, except being a smart ass sidekick. All in All it was really poorly done,and I am soooo happy I only paid a buck to see this piece of garbage. Maybe next time hire a good director, Fuqua really has never done anything amazing,,mainly violence and cursing, never actually building any depth"
" It Wasn't That Bad.
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,7,"I'm not a huge fan of Westerns but I've seen some great ones in the past like ""Open Range"" and ""3:10 To Yuma"". ""The Magnificent Seven"" wasn't really up to the standard of these but it wasn't that bad. Since I'm really not a big fan of Westerns or the fact that I have never seen the original ""The Magnificent Seven"" to compare this one to, that probably wouldn't make me a great candidate to rate this film. I'm just going off of the acting and the action that was portrayed in this film. After ""Training Day"" Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke came together again to put their talents on display for this film. Denzel Washington did a ""magnificent"" job, as usual, in playing the part of Chisolm. This film did pack enough action to make it a decent Western, at least in my view but like I said, it's not up to the standards of some other Westerns I've seen but it's not that bad."
" Great remake of a classic movie.
",2017-05-19 00:00:00,10,"Excellent remake of a classic film and Denzil Washington didn't disappoint. All the characters were believable and it was just different enough from the original to enjoy it as a different movie. Don't be put off by the bad reviews on here, it is definitely worth watching."
" Better than expected
",2017-05-09 00:00:00,6,"I ended up watching this alone after renting for someone else. Not usually a good recipe but hey hadn't seen it. First not a remake sequel or anything but a reboot using same title. Denzel does well as cowboy most others do mediocre mostly comedy relief. Without giving too much away a fun but ignorant romp even when compared to other westerns. If you like cheesy action watch it, if you like westerns think twice.. Bottom line would have been OK in theater but glad i saved the 12 bucks."
" The clichéd seven
",2017-05-02 00:00:00,5,"Destinctly average in almost every way. The remake of The Magnificent Seven is not a bad film but it is not very good and follows every cliché imaginable, to the point where you know exactly what is going to happen before it happens.The score is very average, with the main theme only coming in at the end titles. The cinematography isn't great and the amount of tracking shots with horseman becomes a joke. The acting is OK but nobody really stands out. The story is predictable(even for a remake) the characters dull and the dialogue nothing special. The directing is serviceable but nothing more.Overall a bit of a let down and only worth watching if there is nothing better to do."
" Excellent re-visit NOT a re-make
",2017-05-01 00:00:00,8,"It was a good ride. Maybe people would have liked it more if it was longer with more character development. Every aspect was good and I am a die Hard Magnificent 7 fan of the original. Please watch it and enjoy as I did. It's a re-visit of a theme, not a revised re-make! More modern day westerns should mimic this mode of re- visit and steer away from remakes. I can think of many more ""classic"" westerns that I would love to see re-visited and not re-made in this mannerism! Trust me."
" Real let down
",2017-04-24 00:00:00,1,"This film does not deserved the title 'Magnificent 7', as a huge fan of seven samurai and the 1960s remake, I bought the DVD and watched it last week and there's just no comparison. From the plot to the acting and the directing/editing. I just couldn't believe how bad it was.. I wish I could have enjoyed it as I was so egar for its release but it was really not worth it."
" 'What we lost in the fire, we found in the ashes.'
",2017-04-20 00:00:00,8,"'It takes a village' – in the case of a remake of the 1960 film by the same name – and the script demonstrates that with 5 scriptwriters Akira Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto, Hideo Oguni, Nic Pizzolatto and Richard Wenk offering a fine rangy and well bound story for the talented Antoine Fuqua to direct. The cast is fine – even the tiny moments for stars like Matt Bomer – but it is Denzel Washington who carries the story.A line from the film explains the concept of the big Western movie well –'What ever they were in life, here, at the end, each man stood with courage and honor. They fought for the ones who couldn't fight for themselves, and then died for them, too. All to win something that didn't belong to them. It was - magnificent.'But on to the details - Seven gunmen in the old west gradually come together to help a poor village against savage thieves.. The desperate townspeople of Rose Creek employ protection from seven outlaws, bounty hunters, gamblers and hired guns (Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Myung-hun Lee, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, and Martin Sensmeier), s after the town falls under the deadly control of industrialist Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard). As they prepare the town for the violent showdown that they know is coming, these seven mercenaries find themselves fighting for more than money.The cast is huge and includes such fine actors as Haley Bennett, Cam Gigandet, and Luke Grimes among others. The film is very long, very bloody (how did this ever have a PG-13 label?), but it is old-fashioned western entertainment and worth a leisurely night's watching."
" Definitely not a keeper
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,1,"You'd maybe want to watch this when you literally have nothing else to do (even hanging wallpaper). I certainly wouldn't advise paying money for it. I'm upset that I invested the time watching it, having pulled the DVD out about halfway through.People expecting a script anywhere near the sharpness and wit of the original movie will be sadly disappointed (nothing at like ""When it comes to getting his head blown off, he's downright bigoted!"").It has the digitised feel of a modern movie. Any of you used to the quality of a laserdisc on a decent player will know what I mean.To me, it occupies the same status as the Timothy Dalton Bond movies - they have some merit in their own right, but should not be compared to the originals.It's a shame the actors don't get a say in the editing!"
" Weapons use of.
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,5,"I think most of the spoilers have already been made so I will not make any more. I believe there was a black bounty hunter and lawman in post Civil War times,I do not have his name, so Chisholm is not so incongruous. I think everybody knows that pistols were not accurate beyond thirty paces, but every shot by the heroes hits a mark even with moving targets! As has been said if you have Gatling gun (prone to jamming BTW)capable of shredding the town from a safe distance why not use it, and save a lot of lives in the bad guy ranks? Also why did the very long frontal charge keep going while they were being blown up? They are not the Light Brigade after all. Then the 'bad Indian' takes time to shoot the Mountain Man full of arrows, unnecessarily, and nobody takes a shot a him while he is thus occupied. Of course there were no dead or wounded horses in spite of the hail of bullets, we cannot offend the animal lovers can we?"
" Much better than expected
",2017-04-15 00:00:00,7,"I had no problem with the John Sturges MAGNIFICENT SEVEN being remade; after all, the original itself was a remake of Kurosawa's SEVEN SAMURAI, and enough time has passed for a remake to be viable for a new generation. The good news is that this version defies expectations and is an engaging, often gripping western made with a decent budget and plenty of well-shot action to recommend it. I've not seen many of Antoine Fuqua's movies, but his handling of the stylistics and the dominant action makes this film a delight to watch.The story is simplistic enough and despite the two and a quarter hour running time it never feels padded or slow. The cast can't hope to hold a candle to the original movie's, but the reliable Denzel Washington holds things together pretty well and the diverse ethnicities of the seven is a nice touch. Highlights include Vincent D'Onofrio's hulking bear trapper, Lee Byung-hun's slick knife-thrower, and Martin Sensmeier's bad-ass Native American. The only misstep is the casting of the overrated Chris Pratt in the Steve McQueen role; he's consistently unfunny in the part.The film is dominated by two big action scenes, the first a small-scale skirmish at the halfway mark and the last an endless battle sequence at the climax. Both are shot very well with the violence hard-hitting despite the family-friendly rating. It says something that the action remains fresh and exciting throughout, never repetitive or padded. For these reasons I give THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN a thumbs-up as a pleasant surprise of a movie."
" Magnificent Denzel
",2017-04-05 00:00:00,8,"Denzel Washington is the lead here, in the role made famous by Yul Brynner in the original version of this movie from 1960. Most remakes are not a good idea; ""Carrie"" being the most recent example of the bad do over. This is the way to do it right as using a great cast is the most important aspect of a good film and Denzel is supported by excellent actors, from Peter Sarsgaard as the vicious robber baron out to steal the land from the hard working town people to Chris Pratt, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Ethan Hawke as the good guys coming to the rescue of the victims of injustice. The story is a typical spaghetti western one familiar to any viewer of Sergio Leone's or Clint Eastwood's work. Director Antoine Fuqua does an admirable job in using a similar style as his predecessors. The New Mexico scenery is beautiful, and although extremely violent, The Magnificent Seven is a great work."
" The original is a classic this one is terrible
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,1,"When you compare this to the original, you wonder why they even tried... They would have been better off doing something original themselves. This effort lack in every category even with the script already written for it.I would say without any hesitation skip this poorly executed movie and watch the original instead, you will thank me for it later!"
" Barely a shadow of the original Japanese movie and the 60's western remake
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,5,"Some said that Kurosawa was influenced by John Ford's western movies when he realized the ""Seven Samurai"", funny to think about that when this movie had later a huge influence on other films makers like Sergio Leone, Arthur Penn, and of course John Sturges whose remake of Kurosawa's movies in a western context impress the later so much that he offers Sturges a katana to thank him. And we have to admit that the 1960 ""Magnificent Seven"" is a master piece with giant of the art in it. Yul Brynner, Charles Bronson,Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Robert Vaughn, Horst Buchholz. So when I saw the fist names for the casting of the 2016 remake, I was excited! Think about it; Denzel Washington, ruthless in Equalizer; Ethan Hawke, Torn soul in Good Kill; Vincent D'Onofrio, Machiavellian in Dare Devil and ...that's all. What do you mean Chris Pratt? Oh! You mean that guy who Hollywood is trying to force feed us. Nah not memorable, even when he plays ""talk to the hand"" with raptors. One of the problem, there is no osmosis between the protagonist. Just consider in the 1960 movie the first meet between Yul Brynner and Steve McQueen, it is a very short scene at the beginning of the movie, you immediately feel the two connect, two pros respecting each other. Nothing to compare in the 2016 movie, When Denzel Washington cross path with Pratt, the scene is so long, like if they were trying to explain why a white guy had to work with a black guy, the relation with the two is a boss/employee relation as Washington's character own Pratt's character's horse hence the second had no choice then to follow the first one. But Why did they had to do that in the 2016 script? They suppose to be mercenaries,it is in the title, they do it for money and only find honor in death. This is the whole story behind Kurosawa's and Sturges's movie. But here those guys are already the nice guys from the beginning, then who cares about their stories, they won't and we won't learn anything from their journey. The others mercenaries are interesting too but we know little about them; Hawke who have lost his balls,but why? Lee Byung-hun who is following him like a dog, but why? D'Onofrio looking for redemption, but why again? and the two whom nobody remember what they did in the movie but they had to be seven so let put some extra for figuration in the casting. Too much exposure on 2 characters and barely enough light on the rest of the cast. This is frustrating Too bad, they miss an opportunity to use great actors at their pick potential. the movie is a stall dish, no spice, no surprise we already know who die and who won't in the first quarter."
" Very good remake of an old classic
",2017-03-30 00:00:00,10,"This is indeed a very good remake of an old classic. As always I am a bit worried when they make a remake of old classics that I liked. This remake is well worth watching though. Despite having a few minor gripes I went for 5 out of 5 stars on this one.Most of you are probably familiar with the story of The Magnificent Seven. Gunslinger gets hired to protect a village from the evil industrialist, he picks 6 buddies to help him, trains the villagers, digs in and sits down and waits for the bad guys to arrive. A simple and well suited story for a bit of Western entertainment. I guess I should mention as well that the original Western is actually not the ""real"" original. That honor befalls Shichinin no samurai, or Seven Samurai in English, which is a Samurai movie by Akira Kurosawa and with Toshirô Mifune in the lead role. That is the movie from which the plot originates.Anyway, history lesson is over, back to this movie. The movie starts of by introducing the main characters. The bad industrialist is a nasty piece of thug and quickly demonstrates that, although by no means being a blood splatter movie, it is definitely more cruel than what I remember from the original. Next in line is the movies hero played by Denzel Washington and I have to say that he plays the role very well. I liked him as the calm, fairly silent, but oh so deadly gunslinger from the first frame to the last.The other characters fit quite well into their roles as well. I cannot make up my mind about Jack Horne though. I did like the character but at the same time I felt that he was a wee bit to comical at times. I also liked Goodnight Robicheaux quite a lot but the writer really went a bit over the top as far as I am concerned when he actually left.Of course the entire movie plays out as a build up to the final big fight and it is a big fight, that has to be said. However there are plenty of things happening during this build up. Both things involving chemically propelled slugs flying around and things slightly less noisy.Sam Chisolm has to pick up his buddies of course, each one being an opportunity for some cool movie story telling. Then we have the training of the villagers which, as expected, becomes a wee bit comical at times. Oh, and I almost forget that there is a nice little shootout when Chisolm and his buddies introduces themselves to Bogue's thugs in the village. Said thugs includes the local Sheriff. To no ones surprise I believe. So much for law and order. Time for a new management.So, fast forward to the end and the big fight. It is big, it is well done and it involves plenty of things that go boom. It is plenty of action but it is also the part of the movie where I have the biggest gripe. Okay folks there are going to be a mild spoiler now. With that out of the way, let's go to the Gatling gun. It is always cool to see a Gatling gun let loose. However can we keep it a bit more realistic please? They fire thousands of bullets without reloading (they make a fuss about reloading later in the movie). Also they position the gun out in the open where it would have been relatively easy to shoot the men operating it. An idea that they finally get much later and manage to goof up. The final solution to taking out the gun is dramatic but quite convoluted. This is the part of the movie that made me go a bit what the f...!Apart from that I really enjoyed this movie. A good remake of an old classic."
" PC characters that it's hard to care about
",2017-03-27 00:00:00,4,"From the trailers this looked like it would be an excellent remake of John Sturges's version. It looks the part, the actors are fine but the story kind of sucks. The build up to the climax is just OK - Chris Pratt's character tries hard to be a man of humor but undermines what should be growing tension in the movie as the suicidal battle approaches. Ethan Hawke's character is way too angst driven. Robert Vaughan played the character as outwardly cool and confident but was battling demons inside. only near the end of the movie do you realize just how frightened he has become at the loss of his skills. The new movie has two-dimensional characters, other than Denzil W's part. The build-up is bland and nearly every recruit is brought onboard via some humorous dialogue or actions. The final battle is so over the top that it becomes one big bore. The worst thing in the whole movie for me is when Chris Pratt's character deliberately commits suicide so he can take out the gatling gun - and it's done in a way that is even more unbelievable than the attack on the town. Why did he and one or two others not ride out the back of the town, round behind the trees which were left and right of the gatling gun, come up from behind and shoot the sh@t out of the a-holes? Chris Pratt's death is a complete joke and is the nail in the coffin of a movie that tries to be an honorable tribute to the original but ends up being a mess."
" shows ho bad script writing has become, and how bankrupt Hollywood is right now
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,3,"This is mainly an insult to the original, which in may view is better than seven samurai. in very short scenes in the original we get to know each of the seven, helped by the perfect choice of actors to play with , the all show character and depth. the villagers are real people we know and care about them. this remake has absolutely no emotion, no character and really no purpose. i like all the actors but none of them even Denzel and Chris Pratt had the gravitas or depth that Brynner and Mqueen brought, the rest of them hardly registered at all. the script has none of the wit the poetry and again emotion of the original. it just shows that the writer of today cannot write succinct meaningful dialogue or create tense and emotional scenes. the baddie was a total cliché, eli wallach had a range and emotion that gave his baddie three dimensions, in the original you care for each and everyone and we are moved when they die. not so in this insipid remake"
" Here are some of my thoughts on The Magnificent Seven:
",2017-03-26 00:00:00,6,"​Hey there.Just watched The Magnificent Seven over the weekend and I thought.....it was.......passable entertainment. The movie isn't without its charms.Right away, Joshua Faraday (Chris Pratt) was my favorite character. For me, he had the perfect balance of being playful, attainable, and brute at the same time. He dies towards the final ten minutes of the end, which was something of a letdown. Some of the deaths were unusually drawn out; his included. Initially I was unsure of how I would feel about Chris Pratt since I have not seen him in a starring role beforehand, but he amazed me.Sam Chisolm (Denzel Washington) was my second favorite. He displayed confidence and dependability. It seems to have been a while since I have seen that good of a performance from him. He is generally an exceptional actor. And It doesn't hurt that both actors are easy on the eyes.I usually like Ethan Hawke but he was a bit too manic for me. There is also an almost unrecognizable Vincent D'Onofrio. The movie felt a little long for me. It essentially is an action movie and it delivers, but I was mostly underwhelmed by it. Many scenes I couldn't tell who was shooting or who was getting shot. It looked frantic at times. I was not impressed by much of it and somewhat bored. The dialogue is moderately hokey. The plot is straightforward so I didn't think it needed to be a 2-hour movie. They very well could have trimmed almost a half hour of it off and it probably would have been better. After the film, I found out that there were a lot of negative reactions to it, especially criticized for being ""politically correct"". Now I have not seen the original 1960 version, nor have I seen Akira Kurosawa's 1954 Japanese film Seven Samurai, but that criticism just seems nitpicky to me. They are seven gunmen in the old west; I mean why the hell care about the ethnicity of the actors. I can understand that there may have been alterations of the characters as far as personality goes, but to focus solely on appearance is ridiculous."
" brilliant retelling of an old favourite
",2017-03-20 00:00:00,10,I have always loved this story in all its numerous guises. The music brought a nostalgic smile to my face with its updating of the soundtrack from the 1961 version. The acting was good all round and I have to say I couldn't choose a favourite from all the people involved. I even loved the addition of a more visceral motive for helping the town given to the Yul Bryner/Denzel Washington character than was there in previous versions.
" The Malignant Seven
",2017-03-18 00:00:00,4,"If you're a baby boomer odds are you cut your teeth on the western. The late 40's through the early 60's was the heyday for the traditional horse opera. Stars like John Wayne, Randy Scott, Joel McCrea, Jimmy Stewart, Hank Fonda, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, Audy Murphy, James Arness, Chuck Connors, Ward Bond, Glenn Ford, Kirk Douglas, Burt Lancaster, Gary Cooper, Gregory Peck, Richard Widmark and many others, personified the cowboy, gunslinger, marshall, sheriff and bad man. But sadly, the late 60's ended the American romance with the western, save for a few gems here and there. And no director or actor has risen to the level of a ""Tombstone"" or ""Unforgiven"", since the early 90's. The movie generation of today want CG and graphic violence and sex. The traditional western was never over the top. Occasionally the lines were blurred, but there really was a simple message of good versus evil. The original Magnificent Seven will always be regarded by western fans as one of the best! Hopefully, this version dies a quick death and remains a long burial!"
" Easy to nitpick about, but a fun film, and an overall enjoyable experience
",2017-03-17 00:00:00,7,"The Magnificent Seven is one of those movies that is fun enough to get you to excuse its clichés. The film doesn't live up to its name, but that doesn't mean its not good. If there's anything magnificent about it, it's the performances of Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt, but Byung-Hun Lee is also fun as a knife-wielding badass, and it is cool to see Washington and Ethan Hawke reunited on screen under their Training Day director, who, along with DP Mauro Fiore, makes every gunshot count. While I liked how straightforward the script was, it didn't have many lines for some of its characters, which was the movie's biggest problem. One would think that a film called The Magnificent Seven would fully develop all Seven of its characters, but I couldn't appreciate Vincent D'Onofrio, Martin Sensmeier, or Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as much as I wanted to. The film sure takes its time getting to its climax, but when it gets there, it GETS THERE. Despite a tendency to remind us of the long running time, and some almost emotionless scenes involving the sidelined characters, the climax alone is worth the price of admission. Although some of its characters lack sufficient depth, The Magnificent Seven is still a fun movie with great performances, and is one of the more violent PG-13 movies in recent years. If you're looking for Westerns, there are better ones out there, but it doesn't mean this one's bad."
" Why?
",2017-03-12 00:00:00,2,"I've lived in L.A.. Never for very long. Almost always longer than I would have liked. Somewhere along the line someone there got the bright idea to import palm trees, I guess so that it would seem more tropical. That's the mentality in Hollywood. When in doubt imitate. When really in doubt remake. Apparently in the last few decades Hollywood has really been in doubt. Maybe it's because television is getting better and better and shows like Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead have as good, often better production value and much better writing. Or maybe it's because the movie theatres have just made it too expensive to go to the movies nowadays. Whatever the reason, it seems Hollywood is as addicted to remakes as Warren Beatty is to looking at cue cards. There's a story that Sean Penn, when asked to sign on for a remake of Casablanca, said ""I don't think they got it wrong the first time."". As obnoxious as he can sometimes be, the rest of Hollywood could learn a lesson from Penn. Why anyone would think it was a good idea to do a remake of The Magnificent Seven is beyond me. Why I'd ever bother watching it is even more beyond me. I'm a big fan of Denzel Washington and the wonderful character actors Vincent D'Onofrio and Peter Sarsgaard. Chris Pratt is charming and funny. Usually. But we're talking about replacing Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, Robert Ulrich and Eli Wallach, who never met a role he couldn't make unforgettable. Yes, you could argue that the original was a remake of the Akira Kurosawa film The Seven Samurai, but Kurosawa said himself that he was making a samurai western with that film, and the original Magnificent Seven was just, well, cool. The remake is far too muddled and tries too hard to be important and deep. The beauty of the western at its very best is that you can strip away all the complexity of modern life and have a kind of tabula rasa on which to paint your canvas. Less is always more when it comes to westerns. That's not to say that Westerns can't have undertones of complexity. Movies like The Searchers, Shane or Unforgiven have shown us that. But the great western film makers understand that complexity should be a spice that is never overused or overpowering. I know, I'm mixing metaphors all over the place. But my point is that this movie, like so many modern Hollywood movies is heavy handed and clumsy and so quickly becomes boring and at times just silly. Where the original never leaves you wondering why any of these men would choose to put their lives on the line for a village they've never even been to, this remake actually gives Denzel Washington's character a reason, revenge against the villain. Which just makes him an asshole for putting all those lives on the line just so he can get this guy back. They even stick him with the name Chisum, and another character with the name, Goodnight, two very famous Texas cattlemen with trails named after them, because somebody needs to show us how cute and clever they are. And that's the story of this remake. That's the story of virtually all modern Hollywood remakes. Somebody is always trying to impose themselves on the remake, and on us, and only insecure assholes need to impose how clever they are on the world. I should know. I'm the most insecure asshole there is. Just ask my friends. Don't bother watching this remake. It's too long and it's just stupid. Watch the original. Even if you've already seen it watch it again, because it has Steve McQueen in it. What more reason do you need. Watch The Seven Samurai too. It, like most Kurosawa films, is superb. Lets just hope Hollywood doesn't get any ideas about remaking that..."
" Entertaining but somewhat forgettable
",2017-03-06 00:00:00,7,"Magnificent seven manages to keep its head above water. There was an interesting plot and fans who were expecting a western shoot out and a lot of violence were not disappointed. The best part of the film is its all star cast. A number of fans would have queued to watch the likes of Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke in blazing glory. The cast manage to carry the film to its enjoyable finish. However this remake was forgettable and at many times predictable. One could easily tell Denzel and a band of interesting outlaws would unite to stop the bad guys. Even Chris Pratt's secret dynamite stick that he used to sacrifice himself in the final scenes was predictable. The plot was safe enough to garner a 7 out of 10 but not in the leagues of getting an 8 or more. In my honest and humble opinion perhaps a twist on this classic would have been better. Everyone knew this was a remake of a classic including many young film watchers. Since the setting of the wild west was always fixed and never going to change perhaps a change in plot and tune would have hit this one out of the park."
" It's all been done before folks...
",2017-03-01 00:00:00,7,"With over 60 percent of audiences siting Denzel Washington as the reason they saw this movie it's obvious there is no originality here. I gave a 7 out of 10 though because it's not a bad movie and I do enjoy the characters. It does feel like a western in that we get bits and pieces of back stories but with still lots of mystery. I enjoy Denzel as a strong African American presence in the wild west. Also the strong female character going out for vengeance is nicely crossed with shots of the traditional western movies woman holding her baby, downtrodden and misplaced in society after the death of her husband. It's a reimagined modern western and that deserves praise."
" Good, if not quite Magnificent
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"Plot; Seven men come together to aid a small town held in the grip of an egomaniacal robber baron.Like the original (itself a remake of Kurosawa's Seven Samurai), this Seven has a star-studded cast, sweeping vistas and (in the credits at least) Elmer Bernstein's epic theme. Dramatically it has a little more meat on its bones than the original, but every beat is played out as expected, every character is exactly who we think they are and there are few (if any) surprises awaiting you. But it's all delivered handsomely, and charmingly, and in the end it's good, if not quite Magnificent."
" Good old shoot' em up western
",2017-02-21 00:00:00,10,"Where to begin is hard to say. I haven't been this excited about a western for a while. The Magnificent Seven is your good old classic western with a little updated action, but similar to many of Clint Eastwoods westerns. You would have a drifter traveling from town to town battling his demands within and trying to find his meaning in the world. After some time he comes to a town desperately in need of a hero who will set them free from some land hungry barron stealing and killing to get whatever he desires. After seeing the injustice being done to innocent people the soon to be hero has compassion and takes it upon him self to stand up for those unable to do so for themselves. In the process of taking on the impossible and succeeding with all odds against him the hero finds a piece of himself and learns to who he is and his purpose in life."
" Ride and Run with the Gang...
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,8,"Remember Louis Robinson enthusiastically recommending this film in between innings of playing baseball on the dusty gravel field of Hutchinson Elementary. That was back in 1962 when I was ten years old. Back then, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN was in the same league as a television show that came on at ten o'clock nights called THE UNTOUCHABLES. Just too violent for kids like me nursed on Mickey Mouse and Captain Kangaroo. So we would avidly listen to the tougher, older, more muscular kids in their teens talk about JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS, THE MYSTERIANS, and finally THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.Louis was our local version of Steve Reeves, whose cool reserve was filled with such manly grace he saw no need to bully anyone, but at the same time encouraged us to fight our own battles. The most I knew about THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN was when it would make the rounds for the Late Night Movie and I would see the advertisement for it. I could vaguely sense what it was all about, seven men challenging insurmountable odds because they were just that bad ass and most or all of them dying in the end.I was close to right.Ironically, I saw SEVEN SAMURAI on Public Television long before I actually saw THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN in its entirety. I watched it with my girl friend and found it a philosopher's feast rich with characters of all types of shading and degrees of angst. I can recall myself taking notes about the personalities of each of the Seven Samurai because, quite frankly, I knew Akira Kurosawa was taking me to school about the dual nature of Force and Non-Force in human personality.Later, when I was mature enough, I saw THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. While several levels below Kurosawa's Zen Masterpiece, what it lacked in plot and character development, it more than made up for with breakout roles given to Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Robert Vaughan, James Coburn, Charles Bronson and Horst Buchholz, shooting it up to Elmer Bernstein's rousing Coplandesque score. Might as well face it, the Star Power was, well, magnificent, the music almost as full and rich a character as the swirling clouds in THE TEN COMMANDMENTS, and who can be as evil with such 'elan as Eli Wallach's Mexican Bandit Leader? The contrived twist near the end before the climatic shootout never did sit right with me, but the return of Chico to the pastoral duties of peasant life resonated lightly with the moral of the original masterwork.Flash forward to 2016 and we have this remake with Denzel Washington. I will not comment about its Star Power, that is for the present generation to deliberate. You will observe that you have never heard anyone say, 'He's the next Yul Brynner' or 'He'll pick up where Steve McQueen left off', so enough said about that. But while the opening sequence where Washington and Pratt encounter each other made me think back with wistful disappointment about the coolness of Brynner's and McQueen's first encounter, as the film moved on I was surprised to discover that it did indeed have some tricks up its sleeve and was originally developing its own strengths.I gave this film an eight because for all its reliance on the conventions of the Western Horse Opera, I believe the story line is an improvement on the 1960 version of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN. It is true that all of the characters could have used stronger back stories to relate to their com-padres during breaks from all the devastating killing, but this was also a shortcoming of the 1960 version. It would have taken a deft writer's hand to relate this in written dialogue or visual flashback in between the action, but director Antoine Fuqua made a judgment call to go for the money shot and by and large it pays off here. The scenic display of the mercenaries preparing the farmers for the final showdown with the villain industrialist Bartholomew Bogue and the reticulated pace of strategy involved in this is a brilliant directorial set piece. It makes a lot more sense than Wallach's admonition to the original Seven to go and sin someplace else. Unfortunately, we do not see the farmers then returning to planting something else besides dead bodies and this could lead to this version of THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN being described as a gore fest when it is something more than that.Denzel Washington's Sam Chisum does not remind me of any of the characters in Western Drama I have seen before. He reminds me instead of Mister Richardson, Ernest Huey and Fred Wells and about half a dozen other men who possessed that unassuming sense of manliness that was admired in my community. Strong men who would stop by in the afternoon to hit our rubber coated hard balls and soft balls from fence to fence after their shift was over in the factory or at the Gas Station or the Mechanic's Shop. This is quite an achievement and I could go on and on about how the other characters represent a kind of multicultural logic of diversity that really made America great. And yes, I wish Fugua had done more with Washington's LEFT HAND OF GOD scene in the church, but perhaps with Haley Bennett as Emma Colton he did just what he needed to do.At any rate, we have here a film that is just this side of magnificent, but still a rousing and inspiring shoot-em-up with a back story for the main character that is played as a sort of hole card leading to the jackpot of the end credits."
" Loyalties aside, it isn't bad!
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,7,"Okay, so I went into this film not expecting very much. Firstly because I had heard only mixed-bad reviews, nothing spectacular. Secondly, because admittedly it did look a bit cheesy. Thirdly, because I am of course a big fan of the original and doubt it could ever be topped, but it was for that very reason why I insisted on watching it, because I love the old version so much! My main criticism is of the antagonist, yes he's a different kind of villain to Calvera in the original, but I'm fine with that... if only he were in any way intimidating. He acts like a nervous waiter on his first day of the job, much less a cold land grabbing psychopath. His meek tone doesn't help I suppose... On the other hand, the 7 themselves are a good bunch of characters. Most of them are very different from their original characters, but that's okay! I already separated the two long before I saw the film. Pratt in particular is a great addition, and Denzel of course never fails to impress. The visuals are pretty good too, and the action isn't the same mundane stuff you get in uninteresting action films nowadays. Yes, there were a few twists we all saw coming but it doesn't bother me, it was largely executed well. Nothing will ever top the original for me in this regard, but that's not to say this one is dreadful. I quite enjoyed it, which I wasn't expecting at all. I just wish they'd have used the original soundtrack more, it's far too electrifying to be left out."
" Beautiful band of misfits
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,7,"After finally taking the time to watch the film, I was overall pleased with it. I've never seen the original but i enjoyed this one enough to find it and watch it. There were a few reasons I enjoyed it, starting with the fact that it was your typical western movie but it wasn't typical at the same time. It was your typical western story of a business man taking over a village for gold or oil whatever it may be and here comes ""the new sheriff in town"" if you will, to save the day. Now what sets this one apart from the others I've seen, is the level of comedy brought to it. Cue this combination of seven misfits/outlaws that Denzel manages to scrounge together. Although they had everything in the world against them, the writer didn't make the movie too serious. Funny jokes and stories, and sometimes you just look at the character and can't help but smirk. Even with all the comedy, in the end you still get that sense of satisfaction you're looking for all the while, upset about the ones who died. Another reason I enjoyed this movie was the actors/ actresses cast in their respectful roles. I feel as if everyone played their part exceptionally well. Glad Denzel finally got to star in a western. I've said this before and I've never been let down, I've never seen a movie that Mr Washington plays in the i don't like. They may not be great films, but they are all 6 stars or better. I though every cast member just fit the character they were playing. All in all, I enjoyed this movie, and i would highly recommend anyone to watch this movie even if you don't enjoy westerns. Now if you do enjoy classic westerns you may not enjoy this one because it doesn't necessarily fit the mold of your typical western..."
" A Decent Remake
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,6,"This remake of the 1960 Western essentially begins with a ruthless robber baron by the name of ""Bartholomew Bogue"" (Peter Sarsgaard) who is not content with simply mining on the outskirts of a town known as Rose Creek but also wants all of the land belonging to the townspeople as well. And he has no qualms about resorting to murder and intimidation to get what he wants. So in a desperate attempt to retain their land and have justice served, two people by the names of ""Emma Cullen"" (Haley Bennett) and ""Teddy Q"" (Luke Grimes) approach a bounty hunter named ""Sam Chisholm"" (Denzel Washington) and plead for his help. Although he normally works for much more than they can afford he accepts their offer and immediately begins to gather up as many good gunmen as he can find knowing that he has to act fast before Bartholomew Bogue can recruit even more henchmen than he already has. After gathering 6 good men he rides out to the town of Rose Bud with the hope of training the local townspeople as much as possible to defend the town against almost impossible odds. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, in comparison to other Western films, this particular movie wasn't too bad. I especially liked the performances of Vincent D'Onofrio (as the trapper named ""Jack Horne"") and the aforementioned Denzel Washington. However, there really wasn't much to distinguish it from its distinguished predecessor to warrant a much higher rating. Slightly above average."
" Barely watchable unnecessary remake
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,1,"First let me say this, even the superior 1960's version pales before the often imitated Seven Samurai. Having said that, where is the story for this? These seven guys (all politically correct as befits our wimp society) have virtually no back story. All this film and we learn next to nothing about any of them. They get together like it's nothing. No qualms, no trouble. Let's just train these cowardly townspeople. And they do so in a week. There's massive bloodshed in this but it's so lifeless I couldn't care at all. I didn't even when the good guys were getting killed. And one of them has a totally ridiculous death that took any reality out of this film. (No spoilers here - watch it and see for yourself.) How come no one ever reloads in this either? It's just shooting and shooting and shooting. At least the Indian character runs out of arrows. Really if you want to see a great western, break out Unforgiven or Open Range. This one may live on as a curiosity, but it's little more than that. Want to see a good remake? True Grit, which is a closer adaptation to the novel and isn't buried in PC crap like this."
" A very worthy western
",2017-02-12 00:00:00,7,"7/10 appropriately enough. Action packed would probably be an understatement. The entire third act was a gunfight, no exaggeration. Chris Pratt played Chris Pratt as usual but I still can't hate him. I would have liked to get more backstory on the different people, but with there being 7 of them, that just wouldn't be doable. Vincent D'onofrio's character was wholly unique. I'm curious if that's how the character was written up or if it was something he chose to bring to the role. This is also the best I've seen Ethan Hawk in a while. For too long he's played the same cookie cutter characters, but this gave him a chance to do something a bit different. This is no Tombstone, but I still genuinely enjoyed this western."
" Doesn't Seem to Deviate too Far from the Original Magnificent 7
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,7,"I don't have a problem with studios remaking classic movies as long as they can put a cool new spin on them. What this film tried to do didn't leave me on the edge of my seat as the differences primarily dealt with the characters rather than the story. It was nice to see more of the seven getting more screen time. The 60's version had about three of the seven receiving significant roles while this film did a decent job of adding depth to the cast. I would say five of the seven had a decent amount of lines. One of the major hits this movie takes before releasing to theaters is having Denzel replace Yul Brynner. I am not saying Denzel is a bad actor by any means; he was just given the impossible task of matching Yul's presence. While I watched the 60's version there was just that constant intensity. I just get that feeling in the remake, well a little from Vincent's character but that was about it. (Vincent played an awesome character and turned out to be the highlight of the movie).The pacing of the movie was good, nothing seemed rushed in the slightest. The dialogue was okay, nothing was all that quotable. As far as action scenes go it was rather middle of the road, nothing blew my mind, but I also was not left scratching my head saying really (okay maybe once but that is a spoiler).This was not a bad film and the current rating of a 7.0 is spot on the mark. The movie is a decent remake with many familiar scenes to the original. Whether you liked it or hated it you should still give the 60's version a try."
" Amazing movie!
",2017-02-10 00:00:00,8,"Many people have disliked this movie for numerous reasons. Sure some of the characters may not be the best developed, but lets be honest they were not too well developed in the original. This movie is full of awesome acting, and great comedic timing. This movie is also making the audience expecting an amazing final fight and it definitely delivers! Spoiler!Even with some of the characters not being the best developed, they are all likable, and I for one ended up sad when they bit they met their fate. One of the best scenes ever is where Chris Pratt gets on his horse and goes on his final ride, with Ethan Hawke and Byung-hun Lee's characters sniping all of the enemies off his back so that he can save everyone else. This scene for in my opinion is one of the most amazing western moments since Tombstone.I highly recommend this movie! Even if you do not enjoy this movie as much as I do, I can still guarantee that you will have a fun time watching this movie. This review is just my opinion so do not get offended if my opinion seems ridiculous too you, and thanks for reading."
" Unoriginal but enjoyable for the most part
",2017-02-08 00:00:00,7,"Overall, this movie doesn't have the most original story or characters, but it's great for pure entertainment, without thinking too deeply, but just to enjoy the gratifying action and vengeance against the evil. The ending is easily predictable- the story really doesn't have much and isn't at all realistic. There's no kind of suspense in the plot, but the thrill is in the action itself, which is shown throughout most parts of the movie. It was also interesting to see people from different origins use different ways to fight together, which was not shown often in the original western movies of similar background.The message that the movie gives, if any, is also quite stale. However, if you watch the movie without expecting such things, as I did, you would probably find the movie watchable. It certainly illustrates the ambiance in those areas at that time very well, and is pretty visually pleasing. The simplicity of the setting and the plot actually makes the grandeur of being righteous during that century stand out. The image and the effects also help to create that ambiance."
" What's not to predict?
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,8,"Given that the Japanese original ""original"" was made in 1954. That the first Hollywood remake was made in 1960 and the remake was then re-made in 2016 I hope you can excuse me for not being surprised at the general plot line.This is a decent modern re-tell on the western version of the original Akira Kurosawa film.It's Hollywood!If you are unable to go to a movie without challenging what is realistic then stop wasting your money and sit at home watching the shopping channel 'cos even the news guys get confused sometimes.It's a movie. Even if based on real life events, it's based on the version that will sell seats. Cops don't do what Hollywood shows Docs don't do what Hollywood shows Firemen don't do what Hollywood shows .... cos that would be a black smoke filled screen!Accept this movie for what it is. A ripping yarn! ...... not so sure about the 12 rating thoughI Liked itIf you can live with ""alternative facts"" in the real world. Then an ""alternative interpretation"" should be a small step"
" Kills inventory
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,4,"Even if there's good actors, the film is flood with long and boring fights. The final fight last 37 minutes. Even if there's excellent stunts I was bored after 5 minutes. Suspecting an impossible number of kills, I rewind and start counting. A cavalry of around 90 cowboys charged for the last fight (13 stay with the Gautling Gun), I've count 130 kills for only 33 good guys. Another 33 where kill during the 1 st street fight and 2 at the bar. At the beginning, there was a total of 165 sheriffs or affiliated outlaws to control a town of about 31 souls. For the numbers errors, it's possible that many bandits were resussitated in the church or infected by a Zombie virus (a sequence would have help). The budget was estimated at 90 Million$ (IMDB) for a come back of 93 Million$. A profit of 3 Million$. Wow !It would be a lot of money for me, but for the producers ? I'm curious to know."
" I seek righteousness. But I'll take revenge.
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,8,"Directed by Antoine Fuqua and written by Nic Pizzolatto and Richard Wenk. Starring Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vincent D'Onofrio, Byung-hun Lee, Manuel Garcia-Rulfo, Martin Sensmeier, Haley Bennett and Peter Sarsgard. Music is by Simon Franglen (also working from a James Horner template) and cinematography by Mauro Fiore.Seven gunmen band together to aid the town of Rose Creek whose inhabitants are being driven out by ruthless capitalist Bartholomew Bogue.We are now in an age of film making where ""tagged classics"" are no longer sacrosanct. Any number of these ""tagged classics"" have been and will become viable for remake - reboot - reimaging for newer audiences. It's here, it happens and really there's nothing we can do about it but moan amongst ourselves. John Sturges' 1960 The Magnificent Seven (itself a remake of Kurosawa pic Yojimbo) is a much loved film, and not just in Western lovers circles, it's a film that non Western fans are known to enjoy - and rightly so, it deserves its place as a ""tagged classic"" and still enthrals over 50 years since its release. So the big studio big wigs and Antoine Fuqua were taking a major gamble remaking a classic remake with their own remake!Undeniably the shadows loom large over the 2016 version, so much weight of expectation, in fact to some it was a stinker of a film even before it was released! Well, as those who have seen it will attest, both the fans and the dissenters, it hasn't raised the bar for the ""Seven"" formula, but, and this is very key here, the makers wasn't setting out to make a film that down the line would be a perceived a ""tagged classic"", and this is evident in the ream of extras available on the Blu-ray releases. They achieved what they set out to do, to make a blunderbuss Oater for the modern era to sample, and they have done it with much love, much cool and lashings of technical greatness. Add in a cast clearly enjoying themselves and not letting anyone down, and it's a tasty plate of beans.Fuqua updates things by having his seven as a row of differing ethnicities, which works a treat, and crucially he and his writers are respectful of those characterisations, even if a bit more fleshing out wouldn't have gone amiss. Yet nothing is at a cost to honouring the great Westerns of old. Beautiful landscapes envelope the players, the musical score bouncing around man and nature with homaged sweetness. There's closeups, silhouetted slices of panache, superb stunt work (man and beast), glorious set design, and then there's the action. The fight sequences are excellently constructed, a feast for the eyes and ears, death and slaughter unfurled in brutal but hunger appeasing strokes. There's comic relief about the place, and while much of the dialogue wouldn't have the great poets of yore troubled, there is deepness to be found. Intelligence, too, the addition of PTSD to one of the main players is a notable piece of worth, while how wonderful to find a Western lady character of great substance (Bennett excellent), so good in fact she could have been one of the seven!It's a bare bones story, with a pointless motive revelation tagged on for the finale, while some anachronisms will irritate those bothered by such. But if you are able to judge it on its own terms, as a Western entertainment for this era, and to accept it isn't trying to outdo the source of its inspiration, then a good time can readily be had. 8/10"
" The Magnificent Seven - International Edition
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,6,"The Japanese master Akira Kurosawa is credited for the original script (and remarkable movie) Seven Samurai made in 1954. Six years later an American remake named The Magnificent Seven provided one of the exception of that rule too often true which says that Hollywood remakes are much worse pictures than the non-American original movies they are based upon. John Sturges' film was actually very good (in my opinion) because of the presence of great action movies stars like Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and because it translated well the code of honor of the samurais in the rules of ethics that made eventually the lawless Wild West into a cradle of an efficient and lawful society. So the question may be asked - why do another Hollywood remake in 2016. One answer is of course - because more than half a century passed and the Western evolved. The problem is that in processing the script for the 21st century the writers and producers felt the need to add a dimension that was practically absent from the previous 7s - multiculturalism. And so, in two hops, we get from the mono-cultural Japanese saga with samurais to an internationalized (and PC - suspect) story that may fit some of the 21st century taste, but seems less credible in a 19th century setting.The team of mercenaries assembled by law man Denzel Washington to protect the citizens of the city threatened to be taken over by an avid landlord and his army includes almost all the races and nations that populate the America of that time in an 'international' team that will work, fight and (some) die flawlessly. Nice idea, but lacking credibility. Worse - all with the exception of Washington's character lack consistency, they are more the stereotype that they are supposed to represent than real characters we get to care about, even when they are hurt or die.Otherwise, it's a good action movie, respecting the basic rules of the action Western films. One cannot expect Denzel Washington to provide anything but a fine performance. He worked with director Antoine Fuqua in The Equalizer and was lucky for a more consistent and complex role there. Haley Bennett was also present in The Equalizer, here, in The Magnificent Seven she seems to be a little too young and a little too pretty for the role of the beautiful widow who gathers the team of mercenaries. Fine actors as Chris Pratt or Ethan Hawke get too little substance in their roles to be remembered. The action scenes are reasonably well made, but there is nothing special to remember the day after the screening.The 'Wild' West at the end of the 19th century was many things, but what it was not was a multi-cultural and tolerant society. One can describe it as such, but this smells of historical revisionism or political correctness. The West may have been populated by different nationalities, but they were far from equal and far from living and acting in harmony - this is the historical truth. Taking into account that today's American society is as well far from having overcome all its traumas related to its attitude towards race and minorities, maybe such an alternate view can be regarded as an act of balancing. All good, but this does not automatically translate into good cinema."
" Hollywood action film disguised as a western
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,3,"A film is only good when it fits your expectations. I had high hopes for this one. I haven't seen a good modern western in a while - so I gave ""The Magnificent Seven"" a shot.Oh boy, what a mistake. Yes, there is shooting. Yes, there is low jokes. Yes there is seven characters. But that's about it. The whole story can be said in 5 minutes. During the movie you see repeated failed attempts to build the characters - and add a human flavor to the film - all failed. I didn't identify with any of the seven, I didn't like any. They all shot, spit, made stupid racial jokes and were archetypical.If you want a stupid action movie to watch when making a dinner - go for it. You can totally miss half of the film and still not get lost. But if you want developed characters, charisma and a good film - watch something different."
" Enjoyable? -Yes. Good? -Not really
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,7,"I got to see this movie in a theater with a friend who hasn't seen the original and is generally not very familiar with old spaghetti westerns. I think that's important to point out as we had somewhat different thoughts about the flick.The movie was enjoyable as my rating states. However I must say that it's hard to point out anything good about it. The plot is straight up one of the worst revenge stories and full of ridiculous clichés. There's no character development nor are there really any interesting or unique characters. All the common western clichés are used and there's really nothing unexpected about the plot.Yet I somehow managed enjoy this film. The action is good and humor is opportune. It just feels like a good western. The plot is crap, but then again the original one wasn't a masterpiece of storytelling either. My friend said it was one of the best movies he's seen lately, though I must differ. I had fun for sure, but can't really say that I'd recommend this to anyone looking for an actually good flick."
" Unremarkable, Uninspired Modern Western...Entertaining but Distant & Elusive
",2017-01-31 00:00:00,7,"A Remake of a Remake that is Unremarkable but Mildly Entertaining Escapism. It's Far from Profound and is Lacking any Memorable Twists except the Standard Post-Modern Occupation of a PC Inclusion Checklist.An All-Star Cast that does have African-American Denzel Washington as the Lead Man among Men that was the Biggest Joke in ""Blazing Saddles"" (1974).But other than that bit of 21st Century Revisionism that is Accepted by Audiences and Critics as Hardly Worth a Mention, this Western Movie is Typical Stuff from the Genre that Director Fuqua Presents as Classical, including the Rich, Colorful, Sprawling, and Handsome Cinematography.Pedestrian Picture that Tries to Remind Viewers of the Appeal of a Genre that Falls In and Out of Style with Regularity. But the Movie is so Uneventful that Inspiring Moderns to give the ""Western"" a Look is Doubtful because the Film itself Feels Uninspired.Not the Worst Remake ever made and Not the Worst ""Western"" made in the Modern Era, but to call it anything but Product would be Praise it Does Not Deserve."
" Unrealized moments and desperately lacking innovation leaves it underwhelming
",2017-01-27 00:00:00,6,"A story that has been retold in various versions and backdrops across the world makes its way back to Hollywood again with Antoine Fuqua at the helm. He brings together the stars from his smash-hit debut 'Training Day' hoping for a box office miracle that has eluded him. Easily one of the best looking westerns you would come across especially going by Fuqua's technical abilities, aesthetics and attention to detail. But sadly that's all there is to it. Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) is a ruthless business man using intimidation and graft to convert a settlement into a mining yard oblivious to its settler's woes. When he takes a step too far by burning down the local church and killing some innocent civilians who revolted against him, Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) who is widowed from the incident vows revenge. She recruits a Warrant Officer Sam Chisolm (Denzel Washington) to help her exact revenge who in turn has a bone to pick on Bogue. Knowing Bogue's ego, his love for power and his assets, Chisolm needs an army to stand a chance. Right from the word go, it is driven by a template featuring all the stereotypes of a western world. Its as if he has made a list of such and stuffed them up into this wafer thin script. The way the town looks, characters of inhabitants, introduction to its protagonist, antagonist, period jokes everything you can think of has been done many times before. As the movie progresses, it becomes utterly predictable voiding it of any thrill or suspense throughout. The characters of the magnificent seven are not well etched out making them just caricatures who would react in a pre-programmed manner to a given situation. The background score is passable, the screenplay is so by the book might well has been written by a film student as part of an assignment, editing department could have worked a little harder to chop off some extra lengthy dinner scenes. But the background locales and the cinematography stands out making it a visual treat. To conclude, I felt that there were moments in the movie which were not seized leaving it underwhelming at the end.Coming to performances starting with Peter Sarsgaard, his character as a baddie in the movie can be defined in like just 3 words. Denzel Washington does shows some moves as a gunslinger but I couldn't buy into his western act. Chris Pratt has been giving the exact same performance since his breakout role as Peter Quill and just serves as a comic relief. Ethen Hawke, the returning star from Training Day and a veteran of unconventional roles bows out here to play the silliest character (in a bad way) written in recent times. Only actor who makes something out of this venture is Haley Bennett - especially because of my lack of expectations on her. She definitely had her moments and her plight and grit looks believable in parts. Unrealized moments and desperately lacking innovation leaves it underwhelming."
" The Adequate Seven
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,6,"Movie fans were predictably up in arms when the announcement was made that John Sturges' beloved 1960 action western The Magnificent Seven was to be remade by Antoine Fuqua, a director who has arguably only made one decent film in his career. Familiar claims of Hollywood running out of ideas and calls for the 'classics' to be left well and truly alone echoed across internet message boards, despite remakes having existed since cinema began and the fact that Sturges' film was itself a remake of Akira Kurosawa's samurai masterpiece Yojimbo (1961). The resulting movie is a perfectly enjoyable and action-packed couple of hours, although ironically lacking in magnificence. The Adequate Seven would have been a more appropriate, albeit less catchy, title.Fuqua's film treads much of the same ground as Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Robert Vaughan et al did fifty-odd years ago. Denzel Washington takes on the role Brynner previously embodied, and he strikes a cool and formidable figure as Chisolm, despite sticking out like a sore thumb in the post-Civil War Wild West (although nobody brings it up). He is approached by the beautiful widower Emma Cullen (Haley Bennett) to help save her town from feudal landowner Bartholomew Bogue (Peter Sarsgaard) and his small army of enforcers, who have just murdered Emma's husband. Either for the bag of gold on offer or just for the sake of doing the right thing, Chisolm agrees to take the job, and begins recruiting his own gang of former acquaintances, lovable rogues and dangerous outlaws.Hollywood finally seems to be catching up with the ethnic diversity so prominent in the U.S., and The Magnificent Seven reflects this wonderfully. As well as casting a black lead relatively unheard of in the genre, Chisolm rounds up Mexican Vasquez (Manuel Garcia- Rulfo), Korean knife-expert Billy Rocks (Byung-hun Lee) and, after befriending him by eating the heart of slain beast, also brings in Native American Red Harvest (Martin Sensmeier). Making up the rest of the group are Josh Faraday (Chris Pratt doing his best impression of Star Lord), a cocky gambler with the gift of the quick draw; Goodnight Robicheaux (Ethan Hawke), an alcoholic former soldier with a shaky hand and shakier nerves; and Jack Horne (Vincent D'Onofrio), the hulking, grey-haired, God-fearing frontiersman who is given the role of comic relief.For most of its 2 hour 13 minute running time, The Magnificent Seven struggles to decide what kind of film it wants to be. On one hand, it's a western in the classic mould, all thigh-slapping and talking' tough. Yet with the many over-the-top set-pieces on show, it also seems to have aspirations to be a shut-down-your-brain blockbuster, even pitting Red Harvest one-on-one against the bad guys' Native American in what is the movie's most ridiculous scene. It also hints at deeper ideas, and touches on themes of race with the lightest of brushes, just enough to make you ponder how good this film really could have been given the cast at the director's disposal. If it's an entertaining slice of action complete with strong performances across the board, then this certainly delivers. However, if you're looking for an absorbing genre piece and one that justifies its own existence, then you may become frustrated with Sargaard's sleepy- eyed scenery chewing. Insert pun on title here."
" The Magnificent Seven Review
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,9,"Oh man, The Magnificent Seven. How good was this movie? I am going to try to do it justice in this review. I don't think I can though.First off, just let me say that I haven't seen the original remake since I was about ten, and I haven't seen the original since I was about twelve. So, this movie was more or less a freshness for me. That may have helped in me giving this movie an honest rating as I was not judging it off the ones from over fifty years ago. Having said that, let me just get what I didn't like out of the way.It's not really anything with the movie really, but it has to do with the casting choices. Well, one in particular. Don't get me wrong, I think that Vincent D'Onofrio is a great actor, but I didn't like him the role of Jack Horn. I don't know what it was, but there was just something I couldn't stand about him in the movie. It could have been the way he was talking, I don't know. There was just something.Having said that, everyone else was perfect. Fuqua made the right choice working with Hawke and Washington again. Apparently, Fuqua was more than a little hesitant on casting Pratt until Pratt started singing and then Fuqua knew who Pratt should play. And for once, in a western movie, the nationalities of the characters were played by the right nationalities.The story is something that everyone should know. A town is in danger and they hire one guy to help who turns around and hires six more. Then they go up against an army of villains, lead smartly by Peter Sarsgaard. Seriously, I don't know what else to tell you about the story. If you don't know it from the originals, then chances are you don't want to watch this movie. But you should.One thing I am going to talk about here that I hardly talk about is the music. This was the last movie James Horner did music for before his untimely death. As usual with him, he is probably going to get an Oscar for what he has done. Sadly, this will be the last film that has his music. He even added elements from the score of the 1960 movie. The man was a genesis when it came to writing music for the movies.Now, if you don't see why you should watch this movie, I don't know what else to tell you. Like I said, I don't think I can give the movie justice in mere words. You just need to watch it, now."
" Don't Worry, No need for Spoilers
",2017-01-21 00:00:00,6,"Denzel Washington is one of the great actors of our time. He has played several iconic roles, most notably Malcolm X. But here in this remake, one has to ask repeatedly, ""WHY?"" Why remake a classic? The chances of being able to eclipse the original is nearly 0. The chances of it being about the same, is... also nearly 0. Let's see, what does that leave you with? Without making the comparisons between Yul Brynner, the classic man in black, who reappeared in the original Westworld, and Denzel, as Chisolm...Yul might have been a stretch in the role, but he was such a balanced presence in 1960, excelling in so many areas of film, that he pulled it off. Washington, on the other hand.. can't really match that. Not this time.Basically, this version felt more like a bad remake of Blazing Saddles without the laughs. I won't even get into the embarrassing performance of Ethan Hawke, sorry man, love the guy in Boyhood, but not here."
" One element to ruin a perfectly average action movie
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,5,"Most already know this move is a remake of the the original Magnificent Seven which is a remake of Seven Samurai. It serves as a reasonable way to interest new viewers to look up those original movies. For that I thank them.However, this movie would have been entertaining and worth watching if it wasn't for the ridiculous Gatling gun.A magic gun in the final battle that: - only hits the enemy - can hit the ground at impossible angles based on the distance. - can hit parts of the town that aren't facing the gun. - can hit a bell tower on higher ground yet can't be hit by the two snipers in the tower.Additionally, the personal body guard of our villain would wonder into to the town during the reloading break of the magic gun. This immensely stupid act was done just so they can have an Indian on Indian melee battle. I would have been happy to give this movie a 7/10 as entertaining if it wasn't for the poor writing related to that magic Gatling gun. 5/10"
" A good Movie
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,7,"It is good sometimes but not always,the role of characterization is not deep enough, is a failure.Seven characters, backgrounds only Chisolm slightly deeper The other six are almost negligible Chris Pratt's Josh Faraday role is completely wasted.Chisolm's transition was justified by the initial development of the story,this is to enhance the story of the reorganization of integrity. Photography is commendable Especially the prospects composition is quite stunning,gun scenes is the best place to see.The heroine's performance is commendable Sad but strong interpretation in place."
" Great? No. Entertaining? Hell Yes!
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,6,"As Hollywood tends to do, it once again attempts to regurgitate another remake of a successful old classic, hoping for a box office victory . Sadly, sometimes success cannot be transcended over 57 years no matter how many special effects are used, whatever adjustments are made to the original story, and in this particular movie, whomever they use to prop up the leading roles of the 7 gunslinger killers banding together to save the town from a villainous, greedy and violent mining magnate. Again, Hollywood not wanting to leave out one single potential ticket buyer, has remade this new version with actors representing a politically correct stew of race, creed, sexual proclivities, gender equality and disassociating emotional behaviours and in hopes of enticing a broader audience. Where the 1960's version of the ""Magnificent 7"" heroes were primarily white, heterosexual, mentally astute and focused on the task at hand, we now are presented with an African American, a Latino, A Native American, an Asian, and three Caucasians who each has their psychological and physiological balls and chains; Chris Pratt with an overabundance of testosterone boastfully referring to himself as the ""world's greatest lover"", Vincent D'Onofrio, a violent, religious zealot killing in the name of God, and Ethan Hawke, playing a confederate sharpshooter hearing voices, his past haunting him into night sweats. All that aside, we are given the a more violent version of the original, an obvious by product of our protagonists' individual agendas (which we are not privy to, at least for 6 of the characters, and not until the end). Unfortunately, the movie cannot stand on its story, alone. Its a recognizable rehash of good versus evil, god versus the devil. There is only one place to go and that is where we expect to. The Magnificent 7 will trump the antagonists, send them to Hell, and in the end, vengeance will prevail. Lets not forget that although we have a weak and predictable story-line, a terrible script, we have some damn good actors in this movie. Peter Sarsgaard plays Bartholomew Bogue, the vile and inexplicably violent mine owner, who we can grow to despise quickly. His impish cowardly behaviour sets us up to hate him, and root for the visiting team. Chris Pratt throws his easy-going loose- lipped quips into the mix, and we can buy his shtick. Denzel Washington, although getting long in the tooth, is nothing short of great, although he has little good stuff to spew from a weak script. And finally Ethan Hawke, who can pull together a great character in ""Goodnight"" Robicheaux a troubled, civil war sharpshooter, sporting greasy hair, facial scar and a gold tooth. In spite of his demons we root for him, no matter how bad he was in his past life. But lets get back to the jist of the movie. Was it great? No. Was it good? On some fronts. Was it watchable. Definitely. Is it Academy Award worthy? No. So lets put aside the lousy dialogue, the predictable story, and the poor quality character development and lets just be mindlessly entertained with a woofer blowing, bang bang soundtrack for two hours and twelve minutes. Good enough for me."
" Unbelievable plot, action, and dialog
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,5,"Another thinly veiled propaganda piece in which a Black man, Hispanic, Asian, Korean, American Indian, trapper, and a card-shark unite to defeat the evil, white capitalist. The plot, worn and tired from its countless rehashing, is typical Hollywood, modern-western fare. Add to that its blatant incredibility and you have a movie so far-fetched it makes Star Wars look like a documentary.First, it was odd to hear the use of a psychological term which only came into existence in the 1980s, i.e. one of them mentions that the group is ""bonding.""It's not enough to buy into the fantasy that black cowboys (dressed all in black) roamed the west looking for whites to kill, but one must also believe they were ace gunslinger bounty hunters, paid rather than hung. There is lots of action, but nothing believable. There seems to be a penchant in Hollywood for black cowboy heroes these days. Could it be that Hollywood believes in authenticity? Nah... just good marketing.Ah, to be young and ignorant enough to suspend disbelief. But, one cannot unlearn things once known. That must be why I see this movie more as a subliminal pitch for the NWO rather than an authentic western. I miss the good old days."
" Eye-Roller
",2017-01-16 00:00:00,3,"The action is fun, but much of the dialogue was corny, predictable, and eye- roll-worthy. A couple of the characters were slightly nauseating, (Haley Bennett's one-dimensional acting, historically inaccurate clothing/vocabulary, and Vincent D'Onofrio's strange-almost-comical religious mutterings as he bludgeons). Overall, the acting left much to be desired (although a lot of that was due to a poor script), and the speech/vocab was way too modern for the post-civil war era.I'm sure some could say similar things about the 1960 classic, but the legendary coolness of Yul Brynner, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn MORE than make up for it."
" I seek righteousness. But I'll take revenge.
",2017-01-15 00:00:00,7,"With 2016's The Magnificent Seven, director Antoine Fuqua reaches back into the past, shooting the frontier in widescreen CinemaScope compositions, and with colour grading so saturated that it would put the most vivid Technicolor films to shame. The opening confirms the mining town of Rose Creek to be perpetually bathed in golden hour sunlight - cinematographer Mauro Fiore seems afraid to show the full face, so each of the fearful and distrusting townsfolk's visages are dramatically bisected by shadow and light. We see the grandiosity of the mountains overhead, the smoky camps, the frequent blasts of the mining dynamite. And everyone has their faces scrubbed with dirt to make sure we know they are hard, toiling folk. But it's shot in digital, and looks far too crisp and clean for that to be really believable. When the camera cranes up to unveil the entire town under watch of the church bell, smoke stacks from honest businesses and all, it doesn't seem all that bad. Hell, Back to the Future Part III had the same shot and a nearly as dirty wild west. Pratt stands out most of all, and not just because he's one of the designated comic relief roles. When the group first ride into town and confront the bandits, they invoke the Clint Eastwood rule: the side who cares the least (and looks the coolest) is the most powerful. It's not so much a showdown as it is a strut-off, cutting from steely gaze to steely gaze, each stroking their weapon. And Pratt, with that model physique and cheeky grin, seems to be enjoying himself a little too much. The history of the western through this film series is simply put. John Ford popularised the genre, lifting it out of B-movie aspirations and onto the grand stage. A certain Kurosawa fell in love with American cinema as a kid, and absorbed its western myths; he saw the drifter, the masculine morality, and recognised that the samurai could be a decent re-imagining of the prototypical figure. And Hollywood, brilliant as they are, copied him straight back. There have been several 'deaths' of the western since (The Wild Bunch, Unforgiven), and although it's never been truly buried, these days audiences have seen it all. So it is no surprise that several recent westerns have gone the way of post-modern pastiche - they are twisted, ironic, detached, with the violence usually as a point of humour rather than serious climax (Django Unchained, True Grit). Fuqua's version is mostly played straight, but there's one of the seven that fits this mould: D'Onofrio's Jack Horne. The hulking force of nature takes down two men with an axe sticking out of his head before he even speaks, and what comes out is a squeaky, high pitched whimper, and our first impression is to laugh. The character is straight out of a Coen movie; at one point he abandons all pretense and straight up spear tackles a bandit off his horse. He is also religiously inspired and believes that his 'race' of giants are destined to cleanse the earth of Native Americans, never mind that he is on the same side as one. The nature of the character and the breeziness of the film give him a nice heroic death, but hastily sidesteps these tricky questions.An interesting side-plot manifests in Hawke's Goodnight Robicheaux, who has a name as audacious as his reputation for being a Civil War sharpshooter. Robicheaux is a cool customer like any of the seven initially, until the bullets start whizzing about and the trauma of his war exploits is unearthed. In 1879, there was of course no such thing as PTSD, and in film you can't directly acknowledge it, but indirectly it seems to suggest it with his fleeing before the storm. I thought this might have been an opportunity to subvert the western figure - Hawke's never been the action type anyway - but Fuqua simply can't resist the temptation to have him heroically burst back into the fold. It's all very old fashioned, harking back to a time where westerns were plentiful and men were men. After all, would the great American hero John Wayne ever run from a fight? The rest of the crew is assembled in about ten minutes, swiftly plucked from whatever showboating of their skills that they were going through. ""Good, we got a Mexican,"" quips Pratt when they recruit Vasquez. Also rounding out the the gang is a knife-wielding Korean and a Comanche bow-master; they are truly the Avengers of the west. Denzel Washington himself emerges from the hazy heat of the desert, striding into town as the tall, dark stranger, and we see the typical horrified reaction shots from the townsfolk as he rides past. It's a role that Washington has played before and well; capable, multilingual (his ability to traverse socioeconomic boundaries in Training Day), moral, and he even gets the tragic backstory. But he also possesses the charisma and resolve to commandeer the defense, and the pathos to sell this vengeance against Bogue. Nostalgic naysayers might be want to remember that Yul Brynner was as robotic as they come, faring much better as a murderous android in Westworld. His clumsy philosophising is also visible here: the townsfolk win, while the seven lose, in addition to more than half of their gang. The ironic thing is, with today's cinematic demands of action, they've done more damage to Rose Creek than before they arrived."
" Terrible
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,1,"Sadistic and totally devoid of any reality this is an awful film. Full of anachronisms (a settler's wife with decolletage!), ridiculous characters and improbable action sequences. One sequence was even a direct ripoff from Django. Cartoony and predictable this was a waste of money in its creation and a waste of time in my (almost) viewing. I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in a theater and my husband regrets ordering it from Netflix. The people responsible for green lighting this project should be forced to view it and then be banned from Hollywood. Stick with the original and its terrific cast. RIP Robert Vaughn, the last surviving seven."
" Overall not that bad i enjoyed it
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,7,"I like that more westerns are popping up more often they been around for years and there is nothing new good guys vs. the bad guys. The real plus side is these guys have this stuff down, the shootouts, the smoke, the pops from the guns, the wounds look realistic and the falls and stunts just look way more realistic.Its a great story so it just needs a little update. I did not see the original before so i went into the new one with nothing to expect. After i watched the new one i then found the original on demand so i then watched it. The old one just lacks the impact of the new one. I get it though, it was made in the 60s and the technology back then the stunt work was still very new and it was great for its time but nothing like the shootout done in the new one. The bad guy in the new one is WAY more ruthless and this makes you want to even more see the good guys prevail a few of the lines from Chris Pratt i could of done without but he won me at the end with the one eye jacks loved it.Found it a little hard to believe Chisolm made it threw so clean and was caught off guard with the church scene Ill watch it again for sure"
" I'm A Sucker For Westerns
",2017-01-11 00:00:00,9,"I never saw the original so I admit that I have no reference for this movie. I knew that there was a Magnificent 7 in 1960 but that movie preceded me and it never made my ""to watch"" list.Still, I am a sucker for Westerns. They don't even have to be all that good. But make them good and star-studded like this one and oooooweeee I'm hooked like a striped bass. At its core, this Western is not much different than any other. You have some good guys and bad guys. You have a wrong, or wrongs that were done that require some good ol' fashioned payback. And nothing is better than some good ol' fashioned payback. The hook is all in how the punishment is meted out.The acting in this movie was fantastic. Peter Sarsgaard (Bart Bogue) played a grade A dirtbag. I hated him with every fiber of my being. Denzel (Chisolm) is Denzel, what more needs to be said. Ethan Hawke (Robicheaux), Chris Pratt (Faraday) and the others were all exceptional but I have to reserve a special appreciation for Vince D'Onofrio (Jack Horne). He was terrific as the religious Davy Crockett/mountain man type.I loved the movie, but like I said, I'm a sucker for Westerns so don't take my word for it."
" If it's a comedy action you want, look no further.
",2017-01-10 00:00:00,8,"I read a description for this movie that goes ""A group of bandits take over a small town, and a group of seven men decide to fight against them."" That description is literally everything in the movie, no more, no less.That's not a bad thing though. Every performance in the movie was great, Denzel Washington gives his typical ""I like a good laugh but I also want to get down to business"" act, while Chris Pratt gives his ""I love telling jokes, but this is serious so I got to try to act like it"". Action scenes where also done very well, sure some of it was off the top or cliché (characters keep walking even after getting shot 40 times) but it was still great to watch.If you just want 2 hours of jokes, action, and a Western theme that you don't see very often anymore, this is that sort of movie. Obviously if you're looking for something more deep and Oscar worthy this ain't for you."
" Disappointed me
",2017-01-09 00:00:00,4,"I did't like, It disappointed me, the original version had spirit, had poetry, this new has nothing else one hundreds of bullets. The film begin bad with the recruitment of the bunch, where are the motivations? none is credible at all, how different is this re-make from The Seven Samurai and the original The Magnificent Seven. And the bad guy? Calvera was a real character, a leader, Bartholomew Bogue is nothing more than a butcher with money enough to paying gunmen. In addition, the original films raise the issue of confronting two completely different ways of life, the peasants, who live off the land and with the land and bandits and gunmen, living free of ties but also without roots and without hope. In this remake it lacks that base in which sustains great part of the history. (But I must recognize what this movie may be good for who had not seen the original ones)."
" A cliché-laden nod to the genre.
",2017-01-08 00:00:00,6,"Antoine Fuqua teams directs this re-telling of The Magnificent Seven which sees Denzel Washington take on Yul Brynner's iconic man-in-black character, who gathers together a rag-tag group in order to help the residents of a small town fight back against those determined to drive them off their land. Fuqua begins his version with a sense of drama and violence. Indeed, no sooner does the film begin that we are rattled by a series of explosions which serve as the foundations for the violence and action that is to come. We soon meet the villain of the piece, superbly played by Sarsgaard who somehow manages to convey a restrained yet maniacal, unhinged menace. He outlines (or rather reaffirms) his intentions to the townsfolk with great intimidation, leading to a gunfight which results in the townsfolk searching for help. It's a captivating start and rolls along at pace. However, at over two hours long, this pace was unfortunately unsustainable. It's a slow middle section whilst we are introduced to each of the group. Some have more screen time than others, yet this does not necessarily correspond with the amount of character development they each receive. It's a frustrating and inconsistent period as we slowly meet each member one by one, all of whom proving difficult to relate to or care much about.The final third sees the gang setting about making their mark in the town and ruffling lots of feathers, leading to an epic onslaught from Sarsgaard's hired guns during an absolutely relentless sequence of events, superbly constructed by Fuqua who never lets up on the action or violence. It's undoubtedly the reward of the piece, so much so that it makes the first two thirds almost forgettable. However, what follows is a rather flat closing which sadly serves as a reminder of the various flaws of the picture.The biggest of these is that this is little more than a Western cliché. We have the close-ups of the eyes made iconic by Clint Eastwood, a saloon full of people stopping to turn and look at the stranger at the swinging doors. We have the inept Sheriff, a Comanche vs Comanche fight and even people riding off into the sunset. Indeed, one would be forgiven in thinking that Fuqua had a checklist of characters formed as a result of watching too many Westerns. Aside from the aforementioned we also have Chris Pratt's Faraday as a card-sharp, Hawke's Robicheaux as the war veteran and Vincent D'Onofrio's Jack Horne as a mountain-man.Clichés and stereotypes aside, there are plenty of solid performances here. Hawke and Pratt certainly stood out but Hayley Bennett deserves an awful lot of praise, too. Her role is a pivotal one and in such a male dominated film, it's extremely refreshing to see such a strong female character hold her own amongst them and of course to see a young actress do the same amongst some of Hollywood's heavyweights. A fantastic score helped add to the frantic action and also lift the slower elements of the film. The performances and chemistry amongst the main cast added a healthy dose of humour, and the action was fantastic. Whilst there is certainly plenty here to be enjoyed, it loses its way with an overlong running time, poor characterisation, inconsistent pacing and a cliché-laden nod to the genre.For the full review, and further movie reviews, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/JMCReelReviews/"
" Entertaining but Stupid
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,5,"I was going to see this in the movie theater until I saw the preview and they used rap music as the back drop. I was totally turned off by that. Who seriously uses rap music for a western movie preview?!?! So I rented it, and was glad I only spent a few bucks instead of about $15 at the movies. Like my title say....""Entertaining but Stupid."" It's like the movie Director try's to make it so edgy and hip hop for a movie set in the 1800's. It just doesn't work, and the acting kind of sucked.Of course in today's movie world you have to have minorities in a film. Back in the ""real"" wild west it was about 90% whites, so of course they have to have a black guy as the leader, an Asian and native American in the 7's little gang. The bad guys also have an Indian and guess what? The two Indians have a knife throw down at the end(guess who wins?) Not much substance or character development in this film and zero love romance. If you don't want to use your brain and just see people in a wild west gun/knife fight, then you will like this lame movie.Hollywood has really become bad. It's either super hero movies or bad remakes. The last really good western made is Tombstone with Kurt Russell."
" We are going to need a $%^#load of Dimes
",2017-01-07 00:00:00,7,"The Magnificent Seven is yet another remake that suffers in comparison to its original source. Denzel Washington does a fine job in the Cleavon Little role and Chris Pratt does a nice turn in the Gene Wilder role. The script though simply lacks the punch of the Mel Brooks original I mean the filmmakers were certainly aware they were doing a scene for scene remake of Blazing Saddles right? I mean there is a bean eating scene for the love of god The movie ditches the original Magnificent Seven's plot (Americans travel down to Mexico to save villager from Banditos)and replaces it with a the exact plot and story beats of Blazing Saddles right down the town meeting in the Church. Some of the cast (particularly the townspeople) seem well aware they are in a Blazing Saddles remake while other, including I suspect the director, are clueless.The movie is entertaining enough and is a fun old fashioned western. I just they had Mongo in the remake."
" The Just ""Kinda Okay"" 7
",2017-01-04 00:00:00,4,"""The Magnificent 7"" is Hollywood's latest regurgitation of a masterpiece--all ""dolled"" up to fit present-day Hollywood's vision. It is another attempt to recast (and make politically correct) a movie now considered a ""legend"" by most.Denzel Washington plays the lead. Seems he's a ""good"" bounty hunter who is persuaded by a young lass to help her town become good and god-fearing again by running out the bad guys who have taken over the land to mine for, *gasp*, gold. Hackneyed as all get out, unimaginative, and just plain old boring, this version is a great example of Hollywood's ""paint-by-numbers"" western. And they insulted the genre better than most.Rated PG-13 for violence. If you've never seen the original (either ""Seven Samurai, which the original Magnificent 7 was based on, or ""The Magnificent 7 circa 1960) you may be entertained. Still, it is a far cry from both its predecessors."
" It's not so far behind the original
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,6,"The Magnificent Seven is the remake of The Magnificent Seven of 1960, the remake as usual is less than the original (which is a retelling of the Seven Samurai), the cast is the best thing in the film, Denzel Washington, Chris Pratt, Ethan Hawke, Vicent D'Onofrio, Byung-Hun Lee and etc, all are competent, the photography is beautiful, the costumes are good, the plot is good, the dialogues leaves something to be desired, the pace is a little bit, and the chemistry Of the characters are not so good, even the actors are good, the soundtrack is good, and the action scenes are cool, highlight the final scene, The Magnificent Seven It's worth it, even though it's inferior to the original, it's a movie Assistible Note 6.8"
" Unlike Denzel - many reviewers missed the mark on this total gem
",2017-01-03 00:00:00,9,"People getting bent out of shape about ""only the minorities"" surviving missed the deaths of at least 2 minorities in this movie (and those that make their review about this anyway need to get a life or a job.) This movie is superb! It's no Seven Samurai - and nor does it aspire to be. It's Denzel Washington playing a god damn 19th century cowboy!!! this is literally THE best thing since Hollywood put 30ft robots kicking the crap out of each other alongside Megan Fox on the big screen in a movie so epic - we didn't even notice how bad shia labeouf was!! Get over your bigotry people - movie kicks ass - has zero faults for what it is. Watch it - watch it immediately!Oh - and it has Haley Bennett. Let me restate that - Haley Bennett!! Haley Bennett and Denzel Washington - in the wild west - with Vincent D'Onofrio and Ethan Hawke - how much more WIN do you need???"
