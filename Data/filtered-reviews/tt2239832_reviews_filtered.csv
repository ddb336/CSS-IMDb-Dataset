" good group
",2020-11-02 00:00:00,6,"Michael (Terrence J) and Candace (Regina Hall) are getting married in Las Vegas. Their friends and family are gathering for some last singles fun. Best man Cedric (Kevin Hart) is desperate to push the guys to go crazy. The girls are trying to get rid of Michael's controlling mother.This sequel lives off of the charms and the connection of its talented cast. There is nothing new or all that interesting. It does have the great cast and they seem to have fun together. That joy of being together helps keep this movie afloat. The highlight is a strip club and the subsequent jail time. I don't really care about their various melodramas or the wedding. Non of it ever feels that dire. Quite frankly, this movie missed an opportunity to have a fun jailhouse wedding and quickly wrapping up the movie after getting out. This is fine but it may be last call for this group."
" Terrible
",2020-04-05 00:00:00,1,"If you haven't seen this movie yet!... please, for God's sake and your sake don't watch it!! It's a horrible trash beyond belief!"
" Disappointment
",2019-12-06 00:00:00,4,"I loved the first movie, even though I'm not much of a comedy fan, but it made me laugh and most importantly, it made me think. It had great moments, interesting characters, a good story and dialogues. I was expecting something like that in the second movie, but it was so bad I could barely finish it. The storyline is honestly stupid, the dialogues seemed like they were written by a 5 year old, the characters whom I loved in the first one, somehow became very unlikeable and irritating. The whole movie seemed like a random chain of events that didn't make any sense and weren't funny at all. I really don't understand how this sequel could be this bad, when the first one had so many great moments and ideas."
" Lost the magic from the original
",2019-06-05 00:00:00,3,"The original film of this franchise was a surprise hit, both box office wise and critical success. Now of course with such a hit, studios were quick to make a sequel due to the success, and as with many sequels, the second film isn't quite as good as the original.For several reasons, this sequel isn't as good. The material is predictable, it all lost the magic and freshness it had in the first film, and it resulted into being a typical las vegas type comedy we have seen before (someone getting married, things go wrong, typical strip club/casino scene then of course an ending with a character saving the day).Very little laughs in this film, as opposed to the original, where it was genuinely funny, had special moments and was all around clever from its writing. Another reason as to why this film wasn't as good was the inclusion of Kevin Hart given more of a bigger role.Where in the first film, it was more of an ensemble with Kevin there in small doses. This film, he was more over the top and the rest of his crew didn't seem to enjoy it as much either. As a result, Think Like a Man Too was an unnecessary sequel."
" couples in Vegas
",2018-11-21 00:00:00,10,Review: I really liked this movie because it shows you that even though Las Vegas is extremely Gotti there is still romantic places you could consider for marriage. The couples including a former player and his current girlfriend who almost steal the show away from everyone else because of his reputation and she having to do damage control. A newly divorced man who thinks he is a player. This cast of characters is perfect to have been roaming around Las Vegas. The director and screenplay are both really good. Both the casting and acting are really good also. There are some really funny moments such as the guys going to the strip club for amateur night and the girls being the audience. The in jail moment feels as real as it gets based on the couples behaving poorly in the strip club. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.
" THE BEST MAN WITH A PLAN
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,4,A couple is getting married in Vegas while Cedric (Kevin Hart) is in charge of the party arrangements. The guys and girls have a contest as to who will have the best story to tell on their bachelor/bachelorette night. Things don't go well and the biggest winner was the Allstate man. The Zeke bit of him having been there before and knowing all the women didn't work well and I found myself growing bored with Kevin Hart pretending to be funny jumping on beds and dancing in his underwear. (Yawn!)The sequel has little to do with the title and was a fairly lame follow up to original with forced humor you see coming for miles.
