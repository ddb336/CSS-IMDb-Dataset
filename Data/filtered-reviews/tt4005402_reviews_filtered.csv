" Disturbing, but important movie
",2021-04-12 00:00:00,7,"I did not know about this sad and traumatizing part of history and therefore I am glad I watched 'Colonia'. I like when a movie broadens my horizon. The movie is not perfect and certainly no blockbuster, but it's still captivating enough to keep watching."
" Incomprehensible fantasy
",2021-03-28 00:00:00,1,A serious and tragic subject reduced to a lovers tale. The woman contrives to see her boyfriend for some reason whilst the population is being subjected to horror.
" FAKE
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,1,None of this ever happened. Absolute Propaganda. Emma Watson would still get tore silly though.
" Nonsense garbage
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,1,Portraying Chile's socialists suffering by Pinochet takeover by two low rate actors with no scenic credibility
" powerful history
",2021-01-03 00:00:00,8,A powerful historical drama that starkly puts the characters at the forefront of a dark event in history.
" IGNORE!! The Metacritic & Rotten Tomato Rating
",2020-12-29 00:00:00,8,"No one wants to read a long winded review, so 'll keep it short then. It's worth a watch :p"
" History revealing adventure movie
",2020-12-06 00:00:00,10,Emma did a fabulous role of lena as well as Daniel bruhl as Daniel when both are in the midst of Colonia Dignidad. Michael Nyqvist did cent percent of Paul Schafer role and portrayed him well. Vicky kreips role as Ursel was emotional. Kudos to Director Florian for taking this movie which reveals the creulty happened in Colonia Dignidad and in Chile in the name of Christian missionary. Worth to watch.
" The dark Chilean past
",2020-11-29 00:00:00,9,"A movie that is very good; its story is tense, exciting and very epic. TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!"
" Unsuitable ""Family"" entertainment!
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,2,"General Pinochet was a bully who murdered innocent people. this film tells one of the stories of a couple who are ""imprisoned"" on a colony run by a ""religious zealot"" - one who clearly likes boys, tortures men, hurts or murders women-who are ""devils"". this man has no morals and his job is simply to serve the President. Yes, it may well be historically accurate but DO NOT sit the family down to this one. It isnt an easy ""watch"" given that you do witness murder and torture and abuse of the women, from a variety of individuals who have been brainwashed. If Pinochet was put in his position by the USA, then someone has much to answer for. There may not be a need for such violence etc in order to tell a story of what 2 people went through. Dont be fooled by religious types such as ""Schafer"". You wont find his type in the bible-at least not in the ""Honest, God fearing"" ""Biblical Knowledge"" bracket. He is an evil man serving himself and his president. Pity Mrs Thatcher wasnt around to see this!"
" Shabby...
",2020-06-09 00:00:00,1,"Guys, this is really a serious issue in Chilean-German history. And what do the filmmakers make of it? A robber pistol that, considering the sufferings of the people for decades, is a pure mess. It is shabby."
" Intensely enjoyable despite missing key points.
",2020-05-04 00:00:00,9,I thought the film was actually pretty great Emma Watson and Daniel Bruhl worked together a lot better than I expected! The film was intense throughout and whilst it missed out a lot of the horrors that went on within the colony it is likely through the eyes of the 2 characters given how separated they were that they would not have seen the child abuse so it is not a problem for me as this is not a depiction of Paul Schaefer but of this couple. Highly enjoyable and would recommend.
" English speakers in a hidden colony in South America?
",2020-04-21 00:00:00,3,"Not a review more like an opinion.I got really annoyed by the fact that magically everybody understands and speaks English in the middle of nowhere. The lead up to the film wasn't sufficient either. Can't really get the hold of the two protagonists' personalities, Emma Watson suspiciously calm throughout the movie despite of seeing people killed and abused. Also, No person would join a questionable cult out of love, there should have been an other reason she ends up there. Was no embassy asked for help, no police etc. I understand that everyone is corrupt but you can't just decide to join in somewhere unknown without a plan. There should have been a lead up to this decision, being helpless and desperate.
I cam give you to the positive side that they painted very realistically the events in the cult."
" Emma is perfect in this movie
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,5,"Emma did a great job in this movie. But the leading actor is so reckless. They were arrested due to his stupid behavior. He always made Lean into trouble. The foucus of the movie is vague. I didn't get the point of this movie the director wanna show audiences.
Anyway, Emma did great."
" Thrilling breathtaking movie!
",2020-03-31 00:00:00,10,Just when i needed some spice and thrill to my night! This movie is a hell of dramatic and exciting plot! I LOVE IT
" Let the truth be known
",2020-03-16 00:00:00,9,"Colonia Dignidad was the German equivalent to Jonestown. It was an isolated cult led by a megalomaniac pedophile fugitive who collaborated with Chilean dictator Pinochet for decades. Neither German ambassador officials nor members of the Pinochet regime were ever hold accountable for the abominable crimes against humanity such as imprisonment, torture and murder that happened there for several decades. The worst thing is that there still is a colony called Villa Baviera that has taken Colonia Dignidad's place. That whole area has become some sort of sinister tourist attraction and people claim that hotel staff is friendly and the restaurant offers great meals. It's outrageous that this place even exists under any other form than a memorial. People who have lost their relatives should be able to grieve here like people who visit concentration camps. Even tearing this whole place down like it happened to Jonestown would still be a better option than what this place has become now. The existence of this place alone until this date is a slap in the face for victims and survivors alike. Germany and Chile should cooperate to shut this place down as soon as possible, start a thorough investigation of the gloomy past and create a humble memorial that educates present and future generations about the horrors that happened there.Colonia mixes gloomy historical events with more uplifting fictitious ones. This movie offers more than just entertainment as it informs people around the world about the terrible truth behind the gloomy cult. This movie should be taught, shown and discussed in history and ethics classes, particularly in Germany and Chile. Aside its educational value, the movie convinces with the realistic settings that bring the seventies in Chile back to life. The camera work is precise and intense. The acting performances by a diversified Daniel Brühl, a resilient Emma Watson and a scarily charismatic Michael Nyqvist are outstanding.This film deserves more attention than it has gotten so far. This is obviously also the case for the numerous victims of Colonia Dignidad. This movie exemplifies the physical and psychological horrors numerous victims of so many others isolated sects around the world have gone through, still go through and will sadly continue to grow through. Education is a strong tool to make sure this world becomes a better place as we learn from the mistakes of the past. It's our civil duty to speak up against such abominable crimes without any shame. Watch this film, spread the story behind it and recommend it to your friends to honour the victims of this terrible place."
" Colonia 2015
",2020-01-23 00:00:00,10,"I recently discovered this movie and bought it on DVD since I am an Emma Watson fan. Before I watched it, I read some reviews and they were a mix of kind ones and not-so-kind ones. After watching it, I felt compelled to write my own review.
As an Emma Watson fan, I was not disappointed by her performance. She was solid throughout the film and played her part well. The other lead actor, Daniel Bruhl, was a nice surprise and handled his role well, especially when he was required to pretend to be brain danaged.
My favourite actress was Richenda Carey who played the evil old woman Gisela. She was awesome in that role and even though she was an unlikeable character I felt bad for her when she was hit in the head by Emma´s character.
I also completely respected Michael Nyqvist´s portrayal of Paul Schafer. I looked Nyqvist up and was disappointed to learn he had already passed away.
Some reviewers found the movie´s handling of historical events to be off, but I still learned a lot about Chile and its turbulent history. One of my favorite scenes was when Lena and Daniel get caught by autorities and are sent to a soccer stadium where Daniel is identified as a dissident.
While some were not satisfied by the movie, I was not left disappointed and would recommend it."
" it's real
",2020-01-22 00:00:00,9,"This film about:
brave woman.
stubborn man BUT not stupid man.
and real love."
" Based on Colonia Dignidad
",2019-11-15 00:00:00,8,"Great account of a true , horrifying cult lead by a lunatic named Paul Schaefer. Watson does a primo acting job"
" Under-utilized real story
",2019-11-12 00:00:00,5,"When telling a real story from an important time in a country's history, I think it's very important to respect the people who were effected by these events and explain their stories in a delicate manner. Colonia does this to a certain extend but when it doesn't do it, it almost makes a mockery of it. So what should've been an interesting movie ended up becoming weirdly cheesy and annoying; especially towards the end.A young German couple is trapped in Chilean military coup in 1973. Guy is taken hostage in a secret location where nobody has ever escaped. Girl goes in with the hopes of saving him."
" True story of Chille in times of some military coup brilliantly filmed
",2019-09-12 00:00:00,10,"One will bite all his finger nails. Such a gripping Dark Secrets of Country Chillies Latin American way
Love story knitted in that period showing Secret retaining Camp open prison capture and....Escape or..... Secrets friend... Just see the movie get stunned. Tortures are as in human as history has seen from other dectators
True story pics were released but Chilke as a country remained silent! Yes definitely culprits were caught booked imprisoned main villain shown in film died just 9 years back in prison. Can you guess the difficulty the artists would have got when this type of people hold the country and the cloud they are able to manage.!!!👍👌"
" Champagne socialists view of history combined with bizarre cult fiction
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,1,"It's the usual cartoon history of ""all of a sudden there were nazi's"", when the reality was that the socialist government was abusive to the extreme, nationalization and land theft on a grand scale, and so were over thrown by the military before the country became a venezuela.The film weaves the bizarrely romanticized history with the weird but historical cult, and a rescue quest by Emma Watson. A cartoon of oppression and repression where Hermione can play dress up in a nunnery while pretending to escape from auschwitz, when really at this point in history Chile was just busy rebuilding up its middle class. The context is all missing, and so nothing is grounded in a reality you can believe."
" with tears in my eyes...there IS still kind of this cults in the world, right now, like ours
",2019-04-26 00:00:00,9,"I cant say more because i can be arrested for writing this,i live in TEHRAN-IRAN.
this movie rally moved me, i understood that many of us may be live under some dirty politics like the one in the movie and be abused ,even cant think right. everything in movie is so familiar for us iranians. you say something you dissapear.
cannot say more.because i love my family.honestly."
" Truly worthwhile to enjoy on a blithe and carefree Sunday situation
",2019-04-20 00:00:00,10,"I'd always love to watch the combination of romantic, history, action and drama genres as it brings us to peaks of emotions with unpredictability, obstacles, resolutions and surprises, and Colonia, directed by Florian Gallenberger, is a good example of that. Its great screenplay and visual effects have not only depicted the era of turmoil and unstability of Chilean society but also exposed the atrocities and savagery of manipulating organisations. Besides, outstanding acting performance by Daniel Brühl and Emma Watson has kept my eyes glued to the screen the whole duration as in the way they came into troubles and the unimaginable way the managed to get out.
Colony (2015) is one of my 16 best movies that I've rated 10 stars, a great one that I would definitely recommend to anyone."
" Gripping
",2019-03-08 00:00:00,10,"I will be honest. I did not know anything about this movie nor did I read the cover. I did not see any previews of this movie. Colonia, also known as The Colony, is a 2015 historical romantic thriller film starring Emma Watson. The film is in the 1973 Chilean military coup and the real Colonia Dignidad. I never heard of Colonia Dignidad, until the end of the movie. A notorious cult in the South of Chile, led by Paul Schäfer. The movie was slow, but interesting. During the end I found to be really gripping, I was really on the edge of my seat. Good movie. I would really buy this movie because of the historical events."
" Really good pinture, but there is more story to tell
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,7,"Colonia Dignidad is not a place that Chilean people talks about: I'm Chilean and I know that. Here, the opinions are divided: some people loves Pinochet's government and others hate it, but everybody can see the truth of Colonia Dignidad, a disgusting truth.
But, why did I not put the picture more stars? The answer is simple: this movie talks about a place were the most awful things happened while the picture gets a political sense putting more protagonism to the government of the time and its relationship with Germany. The thing I did not like in this trama is that it does not have context with the Chilean problems and the people's necesities.
As I said, the opinions of this political reality are divided, but something wrong is to show Pinochet's government as something bad, without talking of the previous governments. In Salvador Allendes's government, people died in streets and there was hunger and trouble anywhere, and they show the protagonist as a supporter of this government without showing the bad things of it. As well, they only show the bad thing of Pinochet's, but the truth is totally contrary.
To be concluding, this is a great picture, but this only tells one side of the history..."
" Low commitment with history resulting in a shallow plot.
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,2,"This film miserably failed at it's two main objectives. First, make the Colonia Dignidad story known and second, telling a love story.
The plot is orientated towards the fictional romance between Lena and Daniel, a young foreign couple that get ""stuck"" in a cult during Pinochet's dictatorship. Most of the film is located in the rural side of Chile, were a group of German inmigrants build a closed community that holds various kinds of abuse, from sexual to religious. All of this happens during warlike times, when people were persecuted by the military government (right fascist) for their political orientations (communists). This systematics human rights violations permitted the development of Colonia Dignidad with the State's concent.
The poor engage with the historical context and the political situation makes this fil superficial and empty. It almost seems like the creators used this story to justify the sadistic performance of the cult, rather than making this a documental thriller. There is no commitment whit history which is reflected in the non-existing participation of chilean producers or actors, and the total lack of Spanish and chilean cultural symbols.
As far as the love story goes, there is uncomfortable distance with reality, as it focus on the feats achieved by the couple instead of their actual love.
In overall the plot is predictable and not exciting to watch. The responsibility of narrating true events like this is not meet. It devalues the harshness that the people experienced in order to make a shallow tale."
" Loved it!
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,9,"Good story, superb acting.. sadly based in a true story..."
" Lacks depth and grit, but a good thrill ride
",2018-12-20 00:00:00,8,"This is not unlike other historical thrillers where there's a difficult compromise between fact-telling and cinematic pace & form, like Munich if I recall. Emma Watson is great in this and the creepy camp boss too, and other great performances are forged miraculously out of an anaemic script and often robotic dialogue. But it is well produced and visually meticulous and there's some great thrills, and good pace from start to end. The story arc can't be a surprise as the main narrator is well, is in it... I can understand if some find the glossiness and the Hallmark romantic component doesn't do justice to the abject horror of the actual historical setting, but as as say there's a compromise. One might argue that this more accessible picture helps to expose a chapter in world history that the more average movie-goer might well have missed or skipped altogether otherwise. In the end it was poignant in places and also provided a satisfying albeit predictable journey."
" This Wasn't a Movie, It was a Snuff Film
",2018-12-19 00:00:00,1,"This movie was boring as tar, watching Paint Dry is more fun than this movie. When I watched this, I fell asleep for 3 quarters of the movie, and was too bored to care about the characters. I recommend avoiding this movie if you are easily bored.."
" Interesting backdrop
",2018-12-16 00:00:00,5,"The 3rd feature film by German director Florian Gallenberger, ""Colonia"" is set against the backdrop of the 1973 Chilean military coup & the real ""Colonia Dignidad"", a notorious cult in the South of Chile. Brühl is great, Watson and Nyqvist habile."
" Whatch it or watch it not
",2018-12-01 00:00:00,5,"This movie was definitely less than I expected, tough I haven't been expecting much. The movie starts with Emma Watson finding his boyfriend - a German political activist in Chile. We don't really know why the guy is there, and what is exactly he wants from protesting in Chile. ""I've been here since four months and now Chile is my home"" - he said something like that, and these are his motivations according to the film's narrative.So then comes Emma Watson, who is desperately in love with him, however, they seemingly lack any chemistry along the whole movie. We don't get any hint from their background, about their bonds, so we just have to believe what the movie tries to tell. To be honest, when I've seen them kiss, it felt like a modest rape scene. (?)People here say how brilliant is Emma's acting, well, I could not forget for a minute that she is the actress, trying to act like somebody she clearly cannot sympathize with. Her acting is really really poor here, I'm shocked reading reviews telling otherwise.
Daniel Brühl was good, but did not really have the chance to shine. Nor the villain the ex-Nazi pedophile cult leader, who seemed to be evil but got really short screen time, to convince the viewers. You dont get to know anything form the rest of the characters, too,Well, and the movie, yes. It might have only been a shocker to those who have never seen a movie before :/ Even if it was based on a real story, it was showing a pretty few things, a documentary could be much more intense then this one. Somehow and I don't understand how this movie missed basically everything that could make it a good movie. Sad."
" The best film that I ever seen!
",2018-10-28 00:00:00,10,"One of the duties of a film is to show us things we can't see and make us experience things that experience those in the real world of our lives, it's a very difficult job. Colonia knows this message and is committed to it. A film based on the fact; that it is romantic in its historical form, and in its political manner, it criticizes people's religious ignorance. The early minutes of the film pass to the character and focus on the love relationship between Lena (Emma Watson) and Daniel (Daniel Bruhl) in a way that we love to watch their love affair until the end!
And When we are well interested in characters, this is the director who plays with our emotions and shows us the dark history of South America and the death of love and humanity in the Colonia Dignidad prison of the country of Chile and we can't do anything but being Sorry for a humans who abuse the ignorance of the people to achieve their own interests, and being sorry for people who have been plunged into the abyss of blindly slavery because of lack of use of thought and wisdom. The film teaches us an equation which religion minus thought results in human deformation and has an unwelcome interpretation on "" an hour of thinking is beyond seventy years of worship""."
" Based on the true story of the Dignity Colony in Chile
",2018-09-02 00:00:00,7,"A thriller based on a true story. As Pinochet comes to power in Chile two German citizens get caught up in the revolution. They both end up prisoners in the Dignity Colony where torture and abuse hide under the pretext of religious fervour.Emma Watson and Daniel Bruhl lead. I believe it's a German production but is English spoken. Emma retains her English accent; probably wisely. Not sure if she lost weight for this role but if she did it was lost as she looked underfed before she arrived at the camp. They both put on a good performance but it's the supporting cast that convey the constant fear of living under such a controlling and cruel regime. It is oppressive but could be tenser.As a movie it's about twenty minutes too long but since it's based on fact I forgive it that. Think docudrama rather than adventure and you won't be disappointed.There is a torture scene, beatings - mostly off screen and moderate bad language. Child abuse is inferred.The Dignity Colony was set up in the 1950s but its most notorious period was 1961 to 1996 when the Pastor was Paul Schäfer an ex-Nazi colonel who later died in prison after being convicted of child abuse. He extended the 'colony' that was effectively a prison and military supply cache. Even after Schäfer the place had a bad reputation and weapons were reported found there in 2005. Claims of over a thousand 'disappeared' people are blamed on the Dignity Colony. Though reformed it is still open today."
" Couldn't get past camerawork.
",2018-06-24 00:00:00,5,"Was looking forward to seeing this, but the immediate use of the handy cam or ""shaky cam"" got me too annoyed and distracted to really get into it. Had to turn it off after 10 minutes.. Did get me interested in the subject though."
" Shallow, predictable thriller filled with clichés and genre stereotypes
",2018-05-26 00:00:00,4,"For a film that is supposedly based on a true story, 'Colonia' has the feel of a cheap thriller with a very shallow and underdeveloped plot. The story itself sounds interesting enough and it definitely had the potential to be an engaging and fascinating film, but the on screen execution is really poor, heavy handed and sloppily written in parts. To say that this film is overdramatic would be an understatement and it is riddled with clichés and predictable events.Despite the film apparently being based on a true story, much of what happens within the sect feels forced, unnatural and over the top. The violence and abuse seemed to be deliberately overdone for the 'shock factor', but in truth after a while it just becomes repetitive and uninteresting. It's also pretty easy to guess what's coming next and the ending is suitably lame and predictable. There is some decent acting, particularly from Michael Nyqvist, but that's about as far as the positives extend."
" Not for the faint hearted.
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,7,"Starting with archival footage setting the scene, it's all very promising, for want of a better word. Then things get interrupted by the prolonged introduction of a love story between Daniel Brühl (who is very good) and Emma Watson (who sadly isn't). Thankfully, it gets back on track, charting the military coup in Chile by Pinochet in 1973, but that's not the focus here. There is some truly brutal stuff depicted, terrifying even and when terror subsides, sinister takes over, with Micheal Nyqvist exuding pure uncaring evil. Unfortunately Watson really struggles in this role, she doesn't quite fit... which is partly the point, but she feels jarring, rather than her simply being the empathetic character. It's based on a true story, how accurate I can't say, I'm not sure I could bring myself to research further, but if even a fraction holds any weight then the levels of appalling and detestable treatment of people here is completely dismaying. Does it work as a film? It does, but it could have been done better, although it's not for the faint hearted."
" There's something about this movie!
",2018-05-17 00:00:00,9,"The untold stories, the hidden side of the so-called modern societies. Intriguingly terrifying! 
However, why is it always about the Nazi? I'd really see a movie about other politic parties like the zionists for example."
" Based on real life events, Colonia is a tough but rewarding watch.
",2018-05-03 00:00:00,8,"I doubt I would have ever heard of this film had I not stumbled across it quite by chance a couple of days ago. Tucked away on the Sony Movie Channel in the UK, this is a movie that will stay with you and make you think. It is a crying shame this first rate film did not receive the publicity it so richly deserved on its 2015 release.Margaret Atwood, author of The Handmaid's Tale, said of her novel which was originally published in 1985, that when it first came out it was viewed as being far-fetched. However, when she wrote it she made sure that she did not put anything into it that humans had not already done somewhere at some time.Surely, the real life events of Colonia Dignidad must have informed at least some of the characters and events in Ms. Atwood's Gilead. Ostensibly a farm and religious commune, Colonia Dignidad was actually a secret detention camp for political dissidents and supporters of President Allende, ousted from power by General Augusto Pinochet during the 1973 Chilean coup d'état.In the film, lovers Daniel and Lena get caught up in the coup. They are both detained and rounded up with several others. Daniel, singled out by a hooded informant as being a supporter of President Allende, is then bundled into an ambulance and driven away. Lena eventually learns that Daniel has been taken to Colonia Dignidad where he is subjected to brutal interrogation and torture by Pinochet's secret police. Lena chooses to join the commune voluntarily in order to find him.Lena's first encounter at Colonia Dignidad is with 'Aunt' Gisela. Her second is with colony leader Paul Schäfer, a German Nazi working in cahoots with Pinochet's secret police . The former makes one recall the character of 'Aunt' Lydia from The Handmaid's Tale. The latter, every deranged, sexually abusive, paedophile cult leader known to history.We then follow Lena's quest to reunite with Daniel and the constant danger that surrounds their efforts to escape. During the course of the film, we also learn that staff at the West German Embassy in Chile are collaborating with the Pinochet regime. The cast is first rate. Daniel Brühl is excellent as always. Michael Nyqvist (who looks remarkably like fellow Swede Stellan Skarsgård) as Paul Schäfer is chilling and Emma Watson acquitted herself very well as Lena.Colonia or The Colony is a quality piece of film making that sheds light on a dark period of our recent history. It should also serve as a warning to future generations."
" Missed opportunity
",2018-04-13 00:00:00,4,"THE COLONY is a slow-moving and largely dullish real-life thriller set at the time of Pinochet's coup in Chile in 1973. The one-dimensional and miscast Emma Watson plays an unsympathetic heroine who goes undercover in a bizarre religious cult in order to rescue her kidnapped boyfriend, as played by a wasted Daniel Bruhl. It turns out that Michael Nyqvist, of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO fame, is the weirdo cult leader who Watson must go up against. I appreciate this movie's realism but as a film it really fails to engage the senses, lacking the requisite suspense and depth for something like this to succeed. Watson struggles from the outset and never convinces for a moment, although some of the supporting players work hard. The ending feels oddly lacklustre and I feel that a documentary would have made this subject much more interesting."
" good but missed an opportunity
",2018-03-06 00:00:00,7,"Having researched colonia dignidad for some years I was looking forward to seeing how brave the filmmakers would be at addressing some of the underlying 'rumours' surrounding this place and its real structure, sadly they have not don't the story justice.... the movie is however a good thriller and part way to showing what a inhumane creature paul shafer was.
I would have liked to have seen the makers explore the bigger questions such as:
1/ are we really expected to believe that an ex Nazi paedophile was backed by not just the Chilean government but also the German embassy, would these people really put their heads on the line just to protect one rather unimportant man from doing something despicable? they would however do it to protect something far larger and far more powerful........
2/ who was really behind the weapons manufacture at the colony, as I assume it takes more than a low level Nazi paedophile to create a weapons manufacturing plant, let alone chemical weapons
3/ to build such a complex as colonia dignidad along with its enormous military grade subsystem would take some serious financial backing and purpose other than a paedophiles playground
4/ we saw a shot of the advanced (for its time) radio room but no questions as to why it was there, also no mention of the enormous radio antenna on the estate... does a insular cult camp need mass communication?
5/ no mention of post war Nazi escapee's who according to witnesses visited and had a role there
6/ many more things that could have been addressed but maybe that's something you can research yourself"
" Every word is superfluous. Great!
",2017-10-23 00:00:00,9,"When I saw the movie score on IMDb, I did not expect too much. I watched him a few months ago and even today I do not understand why the film is rated as ""average"". I do not know if people are aware that the film was made to a true event? If we leave this fact aside, your film leads to the ultimate limits of endurance. The voltage is constant. Psychological play in the movie is brutal.The magnificent Ema credibly shared the events in the Colony. I had the impression that I live a real life during the duration of the film. It's like I did not watch a movie, but it was a reality. This is, indeed, a phenomenal film that is far more attentive to audiences around the world.9/10"
" A profoundly disturbing true horror movie based on historical fact.
",2017-09-13 00:00:00,10,"Make no bones about it, this is an edge of your seat horror movie. It is also highly original. I can't think of another movie that comes close to comparing with it. That such originality is based on fact is highly disturbing on its own. I've seen movies that deal with similar subject matter but this is in a class above. If you really want to enjoy it, or offer the experience to others to enjoy, then go into it as blind as possible. I only grabbed it because I think Emma Watson is a fine actress and I like good political/historical thrillers. I got that from the DVD cover, which was the first I'd heard of it, and bought it. Within ten minutes of putting it on I was literally glued. I had to take a break half way through as the tension was unbearable. It twists and turns, surprises often, sets your teeth on edge, hits your emotions and scares the hell out of you at the same time for a solid eighty minutes. The heroes are so real and brave and understated. The villains are so horrible. This is classic movie making and will probably remain at the cutting edge of its genre long after we're all gone."
" Shock value can be done well, and Florian comes and proves it with a scream.
",2017-06-27 00:00:00,7,"Of course, this wasn't the first film to prove that shock value can be done well, but it is not common for one to use it. Shock value is usually looked down upon for reasons I'm too dumb to understand, and I approve of shock value for reasons people are too smart to understand. Colonia is based on a shocking true story about a real-life cult and it's horrific beliefs, and although we don't usually see anything, implication's enough to shock viewers, especially considering the fact that you know it's a true story. It's not shocking content-wise like A Serbian Film, it's shocking atmosphere-wise like Requiem For A Dream. Of course, it's nowhere near as good as Requiem For A Dream, yet on it's own it stands on it's two feet and confidently speaks it's opinion, using truth to convince you. I wouldn't say the film's anything special, but you'll probably remember it for a while. I think the editing could of been a bit better, but otherwise it was good. Go watch it, I think you'll like it."
" Colonia
",2017-05-30 00:00:00,5,"This is yet another propaganda piece from a mainstream movie that has an interesting enough premise to get a pass. I can be aware of the BS and still find redeeming qualities or enjoy a movie, the two are not mutually exclusive.The dialogue is rather contrived and pretentious, the 'politics' are very on the nose and predictable in that they are over the top, cliché and essentially just propaganda scratching at the surface of issues (first 25 minutes are dreadful), with exaggerated accents, cringey dialogue and ridiculous background acting. At about the half-hour mark, the film is saved due to the delightful emergence of Michael Nyqvist who gives a great performance as usual.The directing is sloppy at best, the editing is sloppy and every situation feels forced, contrived and/or unnecessary. I'll give one example in regards to a sloppy scenario to clarify my point, but know that these details are riddled and ignored through-out the entirety of the film...Lena decides to be clever and sneak her way out and peep in on one of the late night sessions. She has taken initiative and carefully worked her way into this situation. Yet, when peeking into the window, instead of continuing to be clever and remaining hidden (consistency), she starts practically leaning into the clearly lit up and visible window, and of course is spotted. It is now AFTER the fact she has been spotted, that she now tries to be clever again and run and hide. That whole scenario could have been avoided by simply being a little cautious. It's blatant inconsistent behavior to move the plot along and is an insult to the viewer. It really is. These very common details are in my opinion what can make or break a decent idea/film.All in all it is an unoriginal premise that IS interesting enough to keep you watching once you've started, has SOME redeeming qualities in that it gives some exposure into the cult-like religious world consisting of pedophilia and dominance and psychological torture etc. It is also shot well enough regardless of the poor editing and pacing. And Michael Nyqvist always manages to steal the show imo... But it is a typical propaganda piece in that there are a lot of fabrications in the movie (which is fiction), yet begins and ends on a ""serious"" political note with a clear angle leaving the viewer with a slanted impression of said nation. Hollywood loves to blur the lines because they underestimate the viewer...One final note, just some food for thought. Isn't it odd or a 'coincidence' that no subject is taboo in film making, and no nationality or religion or topic is off limits when it comes to film making in Hollywood except for 'that one'. You and I know the one. The one tribe/cult that has limitless amounts of films depicting them as 'victims', yet not ONE SINGLE FILM exposing their corruption politically, religiously, socially etc. (Don't believe me? Google it. Find me ONE major film that exposes their tribe in any shape or form. You won't find one.) Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and every other religion, nation or culture or subject is fair game to be criticized, but don't you dare make a film exposing said tribe on ANY matter otherwise you immediately fall into a 'negative'. An ""anti...."" so to speak. Funny thing that is huh? But I digress ... this film is a pass. Wasted potential if anything."
" Not so Snug a Bug, in a Rug.
",2017-05-27 00:00:00,7,"So, was this film based on true events, like how Titanic was based on true events, because, what Lena and Daniel went through, is straight out of a movie.Without this picture showing us the true nature of what it means to be a part of the cause Daniel was fighting for, his brethren seem pretty selfish, cowardice and without integrity. They just seemed all too willing to allow Daniel to fend for himself.For me personally, it would've made more sense for the Allende supporters to be the ones who orchestrate some sort of rescue, instead of Lena, seeing as, the strength of Lena and Daniel's bond is a mystery. If anything, given what she said when she entered his home, one would believe they're only just really, getting acquainted. Unless, that was their idea of playful banter and flirting.Nevertheless, Colonia is quite intense, and Emma Watson gives a charming performance. Daniel Bruhl, perhaps not his best outing, but, he is proficient, and the composition is very capable. The plot and story kept a gripping enough pace and what happened to Ursel, was somewhat heartfelt.A capturing, 7/10."
" Worthy and shocking, though rather hard to connect with
",2017-03-28 00:00:00,7,"Florian Gallenberger's ""Colonia"" is a hard - if certainly worthwhile - watch, and for obvious and less-obvious reasons.For a start, and above all, it presents a persuasive, apparently-true story that never actually happened at all. I do not know if any non-Chileans caught up in Pinochet's (American-backed) 1973 coup against the democratically-elected (if Soviet-backed) Allende could conceivably have been seized and tortured in the way that Daniel Bruhl's Daniel is in this film (however close to the Allende cause they may have been), and - since the character portrayed does not really exist - I am reasonably entitled to question the whole scenario!Equally, I do not know if any German girlfriend would be brave-crazy enough to join (for months on end) a bizarre Nazi-German cult operating in the south of Chile in order to find and help out (preferably even break out) the aforementioned torture victim, given that the (huge-area) cult HQ was surreptitiously also being used by Pinochet's thugs - in uniform and out of it. In this case, however, Emma Watson's first-sassy and then uber-restrained portrayal of Lufthansa flight attendant Lena Kortus is so earnest, and her young-love dedication to and affection for her beau so persuasive, that the fictional story does at least hold its own. This kind of thing ought to have existed, even if it didn't!Ironically, that (and even Watson's quite-specific, if considerable, beauty) makes handling this film more complex for the watcher, not less, since the fictional story may actually get in the way of the largely-true background circumstance, that the (Initially voluntary-membership) pseudo-religious cult under leader Paul Schafer (here played marvellously well - and hence as a repellent and disgusting figure - by Michael Nygvist) did exist, did apparently entail brainwashing and brutal treatment, the violation of a whole list of human rights and widespread child abuse by its founder, and did apparently have a blind eye turned to it by the German Embassy (though this seems almost impossible to credit from today's perspective).And that brings us to another problem with/for ""Colonia"", given that the cult - at Colonia Dignidad (of all names, hence the title of the film), is presented so shockingly, if at times almost matter-of-factly, that we as normal audience-members simply cannot fully take it in. It is so remote from our experience, so implausible in its reality, that we can't fully connect with the story (thankfully, one might say).Yet a further issue is that someone first picking up the film may be inclined to believe they are mainly in for an Allende-Pinochet story, and indeed the first part of the film would give them every reason to believe that. But then we home in on Schafer's Colonia, and our attention is divided between the awfulness of the colony's role in backing Pinochet, and it's more general and hideous awfulness.The whole ""digestion"" process is helped along a little by the excellent British actress Richenda Carey, who puts in the performance of her career as head of the women's part of the camp, Gisela. This foul character nevertheless evokes the occasional micro-moment of sympathy, and that is a huge acting achievement in itself. Fellow Brit Julian Ovenden also has a bit-part that is more than that, given the way his Captain Roman Breuer has such a major role in anchoring us ever-so-slightly in the real world (even though he presumably did not exist, and his character did not do what is portrayed here, as presumably (???) no real-life airline pilot actually did).While many of us were alive and kicking in '73, the remoteness of that year is made clear by James Blunt's song and the amazing recreations of the BBC's wonderful ""Life on Mars"". But it still beggars all possible belief that something like Colonia Dignidad could have operated at that time. It must be fiction, yet it isn't, while the key love story on which this film hinges ought to have existed, but didn't. And thus to the whole issue with this compelling, well-acted and amazingly portrayed story that is certainly impossible to ignore."
" True Nature Gives It The Gravitas It Needs To Be Successful
",2017-02-27 00:00:00,7,"If one were to judge ""Colonia"" purely on face value, it would be an average film. It jumps around a bit, doesn't have a clear narrative, and doesn't really even have all that much resolution. When you consider that it is based on true events, however, it needs to be judged in that capacity. With that in mind, ""Colonia"" becomes a much more experience considering they had to keep somewhat on track with the real life events.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Lena (Emma Watson) & Daniel (Daniel Bruhl), two young adults who happen to get caught up in General Pinochet's military coup of Chile (both were protesting against that very action). Daniel is sent away to some sort of cultish camp (Colonia Dignidad) which is led by the brutal and enigmatic Paul Schafer (Michael Nyqvist). Lena volunteers for the women's section of the cult/camp, experiencing similar horrors of her own in order to track Daniel down and hope to come up with an escape plan.Probably the biggest ""knock"" I'd have on this film is that parts of it really don't make sense (and really don't even try to). In film-making convention, that is kind of a no-no. You never really understand the motivations behind some of the characters or the things that happen.At the same time, though, that is a large part of why this movie can be quite effective when looked through a different lens...that of reality. One of the characters, a fellow cult member to Lena, utters a quote along the lines of ""don't try to make sense of this place...you never will"". That's what the viewer has to do when watching this movie, too. Instead of dissecting it, this is one of those movies where you just have to sit back and allow yourself to think ""this was actually a real place"". Once you see what happened inside the walls of the cult, that thought alone will make you shudder.It helps, of course, that the acting is mostly spot-on. Watson is perfect, as usual (it's too bad she is taking a bit of a sabbatical these days, as her work is always stellar), and Schafer's character is legitimately creepy. Plus, there is just an air of weirdness and mystery surrounding the entire project that gives it a great sense of foreboding and tension.Overall, I enjoyed watching ""Colonia"" as much for its uniqueness and ""true story"" nature (especially one I had never heard of before) as anything else. Like I said, if you critique it on ""script cohesiveness"" alone it might come up lacking, but once you let the gravitas of its real-life events sink in I think it will move you to care about the characters and their situations."
" better then expected
",2017-02-16 00:00:00,9,"I was really impressed by this movie and I think, it's underrated at the moment. Emma Watson and Daniel Brühl did a great job there. You feel some kind of magic between them. Also the other characters are realistic and credible.After watching it I felt, like I was in the colonia myself"
" Why do they speak English?
",2017-02-15 00:00:00,2,"I didn't even watch the entire movie. I couldn't stand the fact that the protest's leaders speak in English to the audience. It may sound trivial or obvious, but language is a strong component of one culture. Directors should stop assuming that movies must be spoken in English (besides that that is very presumptuous) and start to open their minds to another languages and actors."
" Gripping
",2017-02-01 00:00:00,8,"This is a really well made film.It is impressive at being full-on creepy, with many thriller elements, but also shines the light of hope which teases the audience. It is hard to believe that communities like this exist around the world - even today, but are hidden from sight. As they say,""out of sight, out of mind"". How do we prevent such communities from existing and gaining power when corruption is so abundant in many of these countries? It just gives me the chills and makes me feel so sad and helpless to know that this is real life. There is a great cast in this - looks like Emma Watson's name is coming up more often nowadays. Her and Bruhl have great chemistry on set, and are able to pull at the audience's heartstrings. What really sells the story though, is the expressions of Nyqvist. He sends chills through the screen with his cold stares and lack of empathy. Carey as well, does well as the harsh and unfeeling matron.However, it isn't really shown what Daniel was protesting against, or his motivation in doing so. We understand that both Daniel and Lena are foreigners, but how or why they came to Chile is a mystery. Additionally, the cinematography is great. There are quite a few scenes shot on a hand-held camera or that have unique angles and movement to them, and this goes well with the subject of the film. It helps to emphasize the desperation and panic that the characters feel in that particular moment. The visuals and color aesthetics serve well to compliment the film as well. With a lot of gray-scale and dark scenes, the movie takes on more of a thriller atmosphere. The screenplay and directing is great too, as filmmakers didn't explain things explicitly, but tended to show and imply things instead - involving the audience more by making them question what may be happening. Overall, a very creepy situation which was depicted impressively in this film."
" Shocking
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,7,"This is a movie showing the shocking events in Chile and the CIA involvement in helping Augusto Pinochet to overthrow the democratically elected socialist Unidad Popular government of President Salvador Allende and ended civilian rule. Several academics have stated that the support of the United States was crucial to the coup and the consolidation of power afterwards. The movie focuses on a Nazi/religious cult which was also used to torture and kill anyone opposed to Pinochet. The acting is excellent and the tension is well maintained, you are left feeling angry at the inhumanity displayed and the western world simply turning a blind eye, it is a disgrace that the rights of people are simply dismissed as long as the multinational companies maintain their profits."
" Should have been more exciting
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,6,"A Lufthansa stewardess arrives in Chile in the 70s. During street protests she sees her boyfriend on a platform next to some youth leader. She gets together with him. He makes posters for the leftist youngsters.When the military coup removes the socialist president, the boyfriend named Daniel, for some reason decides to go to the street with the girl, Lena, instead of staying home. There is unrest on the streets, the military/policy are rounding up people. Daniel decides to take pics and gets himself and Lena arrested. Everyone is taken to a stadium where a masked snitch starts picking out trouble-makers. Daniel gets picked out and is quickly put in an ambulance and driven away.Lena is eventually freed and finds out that Daniel was taken to Colonia Dignidad, some religious German community out in the country. So Lena decides to join them to rescue Daniel, who is indeed at the Colonia and is being tortured by the military to reveal his friends. He doesn't fold but instead pretends to be mentally challenged, so he gets a job on the Colonia assisting some metal worker at his shop.The Colonia is run by religious nut and homosexual pedophile Paul. He doesn't think much of women and claims to be able to smell their impure thoughts, actions, and lies. And he's actually pretty good at it.Lena life now is doing god's work--farming during days and peeling potatoes at night. Men and women are kept strictly separated. For months she doesn't see Daniel but eventually she does and they get together. Daniel has discovered a system of tunnels and underground rooms where the military interrogate and torture detainees. Their plan now is to escape not just the Colonia but Chile as well. But as it turns out, Paul is well-connected and his tentacles of power reach very high.What makes Colonia more interesting is that is based on reality. Of course to what extend the portrayal is realistic who knows. Unfortunately the dull, boring, and tedious life on the Colonia is all too realistically shown at length. For a good chunk of this movie nothing remotely interesting goes on. For the sake of realism the movie stays away from too much caricature. Paul could have been presented as some clownish nutcase, but he's not. In fact he's mostly absent in the movie as Lena has to deal with the somewhat cartoonish Gisela who's in charge of running the girls' quarters. The final act is very exciting though as our heroes are racing against the clock."
" A story that has to be told
",2017-01-12 00:00:00,9,Well i guess I learned something new today by watching a movie. I never heard of Colonia Dignidad before and now that I have I wonder how the hell I never heard about that scandalous and disgusting sect before. I started watching Colonia without any expectations and without any clue what it was going to be about. It all started really promising and the further the movie went on the more disturbed I was by it. Not in a bad way though because I really liked this movie. It's just because the movie is based on true facts and that makes you realize how some people are just not worth living on this planet. How you can be so evil and get away with it for years is beyond my comprehension. Now for the acting itself I thought Emma Watson did a really good job. As well as Michael Nyqvist that's playing the ultimate disgusting human being Paul Schäfer. The other actors are all good as well. The story is really captivating and you really hope for a good ending for the entire movie. To me Colonia is one of the better movies I saw lately.
