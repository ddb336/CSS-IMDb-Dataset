" Egomanic melancholy of elite, small-time america
",2021-04-08 00:00:00,1,"The film follows the story of someone with mental illness, but as it's shot with high zoom levels it portrays them as an object not to get close to. So this essentially alienates films' audience with every scene.The tone is melancholic egomania... someone who wants to be noticed by everyone and told they're the best, but they can't, so they look at the ground and cry as sad music plays...In a french film, or even a film made by less elitist parts of america, the person would have others nearby who would come to their aid straight away and sort them straight... instead in this film, they're shown like a fish in a fish bowl, and the audience is supposed to gain something out of this apart from dread and having to fast-foward though it."
" Comedy/drama with little comedy
",2021-01-31 00:00:00,3,"This really looked interesting in the trailer, and we really wanted to like it. It started with a few pretty funny parts, but I was more struck by how little happened, especially in the second half. It wasn't boring as much as uninteresting. You know when you watch a movie and you find a hidden gem? This is not it."
" Just plain painful!!!
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,3,"I'm not sure what Kirsten was going for, but this was too absurd to be enjoyable. The character is so neurotic that the movie just becomes tedious in short order. Another SNL idea drawn out far too long. üëéüôÅ"
" Wiig Nailed This Role
",2020-10-24 00:00:00,9,"As retired professionals, my wife and I can definitely say congrats to the technical advisor on this one and to Wiig as she nailed the symptomology, facial expressions etc. Some may think the subject matter crass, but this film handles the material with the humor it evokes as well as enough sensitivity to keep it within bounds. Wiig tugged at our hearts, but at the same time had us in stitches watching the reactions of the ""bystanders"" caught in the whirlwind. Similar to Rainman, this movie opens up the discussion on a very common and devastating mental illness that we have all come in contact with knowingly and unknowingly and at the same time , like Rainman, it is still done with humor."
" Concept wears thin
",2020-10-15 00:00:00,5,"The concept of this film is great (though I can't vouch for its accuracy). The protagonist is Alice Klieg, someone with Borderline Personality Disorder who has won the lottery and now hosts a talk show about herself. And only herself. It's a fantastic setup with a fascinatingly awkward and odd character, but it wears out after the first half an hour after her embarrassing no-filter commentary gets repetitive. There's some character development but it's too little too late."
" crazy/ weird people
",2020-09-02 00:00:00,7,This movie shows how crazy/ weird people are so wonderful and funny
" Hilarious!!!
",2020-07-18 00:00:00,10,"Kristen Wiig is at her best!!
She is very Funny as Alice klieg.what a great cast of characters. love the writing and directing. Definitely worth a look."
" Soooooo funny
",2020-07-10 00:00:00,10,"Cried with laughter at this movie, and that doesnt happen with me very often. I've no idea why the rating isn't higher, I guess it's your humour or not. I'd recommend watching because if it is then it will be one of your favourite comedies you've watched."
" The writers picked out a random psychiatric disorder out of a hat
",2019-07-27 00:00:00,4,"I'm pretty sure the writers just picked a name of a disorder out of a hat at random and proceeded to do no research whatsoever. Instead they showed a character whose strange compulsive habits seem more in line with an intense form of OCD potentially, whose social difficulties seem more in line with Asperger's potentially, and whose remaining bizarre behaviors seem more in line with maybe a mild disorganized schizophrenia?? In any case, the point being - literally nothing she does, says, or any of the ways she behaves coincide with what Borderline Personality Disorder even is so whyyyy are they using it? This is lazy writing. BPD people don't traipse about in public going I'm cRAAAAAaaAAAAAzzzy, or doing other strange things again more in line with schizophrenics or street people or the like. The bulk of problems would not be all that observable to the public eye, except perhaps scarring from self-harm, unless under rare circumstance she experienced some manner of emotional crises in public; otherwise, as it is something more focused about personal self-image, self-identity, and self-worth combined with intense relationship difficulties with loved ones - really only lovers and family and friends would be really coming across any stranger behaviors. Otherwise, no, the bizarre behaviors are not even remotely in keeping with BPD. I think the character's either misdiagnosed or the authors didn't do any research."
" NOT About Mental Illness!
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,8,"And if you think it is, you're too stupid to be mentally ill.This is a movie about ALIENATION and how our unique pop culture can make us ""crazy."" Oh yeah - & money. How money can buy anything . . . including esteem, self- & otherwise.Kristen Wiig is a national treasure, as far as I'm concerned. While 98% of actresses spend 98% of their energy fomenting an image of perfection, Wiig is a study in honesty & awkwardness. She doesn't manipulate, she just IS. She's carved out a niche no other actress working today has been brave enough to even approach. Of course, it wouldn't have been possible without her amazing comedic talent.The rest of the cast is ""perfect"", as well. There isn't one performer I wasn't happy to see here - even ones I'm not too familiar with like James Marsden. Wes Bentley, Joan Cusack, Linda Cardellini, and OMG - Jennifer Jason Lee - fantastic! Tim Robbins plays a shrink who's weirder than his patient. If there's one cast member I couldn't abide in this movie it would have to be . . . *drumroll please* . . . OPRAH! I burned out on Her Guru-ness way back in the '80s.So watch this movie as the unique little gem it is! DON'T go into it expecting a primer on ""mental illness."" Be brave, be awkward, laugh."
" This is hollyweird's official Ode to Narcissism !!!! Hollywood is SICK !!!!!!!
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,1,"This production is classic hollyweird thinking that because something is weird and different, and actors get paid, that it is thereby good. This is an ode-to-hollyweird-narcissism trainwreck in slow motion. Do yourself a favor and do ANYTHING else rather that watch this trash !!!!!"
" Insightful
",2019-06-26 00:00:00,6,It's your world and we just live in it. Borderline is a difficult diagnosis to reach and equally difficult to manage. I feel like this film approached some of those difficulties in a way that was colored in a comical light while still acknowledging some of the unfortunate realities.
" Unconventional But Warm
",2019-03-17 00:00:00,7,"Unconventional but warm exploration of a broken person who uses her own television program as public therapy; well written & directed, it deftly walks the line between playing mental illness for laughs & treating it with respect."
" obnoxious
",2019-02-03 00:00:00,1,"Whatever it is this movie is trying to potray, it is obnoxious, the main character is so annoying and ungrateful it ruined the whole movie."
" A peculiar movie
",2019-01-31 00:00:00,7,"Welcome to Me follows Alice, a 40-something woman diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. She wakes up everyday at 12h15, plays the lottery every week, and is so obsessed with Oprah Winfrey, she memorized many of the show's episodes. She is very socially awkward and the only people in her life are Gina, her best friend since middle school, Ted, her gay ex-husband and his partner, her old parents, and Dr. Daryl, her therapist.One day, Alice wins the lottery: 86 million dollars. Then she moves to a casino, stop taking her meds, and decides to pay 15 million for her own show at a television station struggling with audiences and profits.
Alice's show is all about her - what she eats, traumatic events from her past and conflicts with the people she knew, all presented in a nonsensical way. She is caught up in a bubble of fame and fortune and due to her mental illness she isn't aware of the harm she is doing to everyone around her. Nonetheless she is able to raise the audiences.This movie is odd and peculiar and not like anything I've seen before. It never gets boring and I kept wondering what was going to happen next. It's not a movie for everyone, as it is a spiral of craziness and some shocking scenes. I enjoyed watching it, however I felt that Alice looked more autistic than someone with BPD. Her behavior was too over the top and some scenes made me cringe. But over all it's worth the watch."
" Alice Klieg vs Del Griffith?
",2018-11-10 00:00:00,10,"This was a very interesting character, I would love to see her with Del and do like a two person play or something anything but unfortunately Del is no longer with us RIP. But this was a really interesting character wish we could get more of this very interesting character by Ms. Wig! I thought it was so funny at times and it turns out she is really sweet, she just needed a billion dollars her own tv show to get out all those skeletons in the closet and thus , not transformed but re-connected to that sweet selfless person she used to be, totally worth watching this I would highly recommend it , tons of fun and lots of cool characters. Kristen is so money! She's like a big bear man... with like claws..."
" Thought provoking - amazing
",2018-11-04 00:00:00,10,"Just watched it, the ratings don't do this intelligent film justice. As others have said maybe they expect Bridesmaids 2, which it isn't. Got the potential to be a cult classic perhaps."
" So Close, Yet So Far
",2018-07-09 00:00:00,6,"Kristen Wiig is quite a versatile actress. In addition to being a great comedienne, she does drama very well (i.e., The Martian) as well as dramedies (Masterminds). Her role in this film is impressive, but I couldn't figure out if it was trying to be a drama or a black comedy.Wiig is Alice, who suffers from borderline personality disorder and has gone off her meds as prescribed by her therapist (Tim Robbins). She wins $86m in the lottery and decides to make her own talk show. Linda Cardellini is her best friend Gina. Alan Tudyk is her ex-husband, now in a gay relationship. James Marsden and Wes Bentley are bothers who own the studio and manage the show Alice wants to produce. Joan Cusak is the production manager. Jennifer Jason Leigh is all but unrecognizable as another member of the production team who can't deal with what they are doing.Alice uses the show to depict moments in her life and to retaliate against those who wronged her. She hires actresses to play her and the other roles, but then stands on camera berating the actors or the people being portrayed. Its brutal at times and other times its touching and funny. However, just as she has previously lost herself in the world of talk shows (she watched them nonstop before winning the lottery), she starts losing herself in her own show as she grows more and more violent and impulsive.Wiig's performance is top-notch. She plays Alice, not for laughs, but as a damaged person trying to find meaning in her illness. The talk show only seems to make things worse. The supporting cast is excellent, but their characters are really one-dimensional. Only Alice is fully fleshed out. The rest are merely there for Wiig to play off while Alice continues to spiral. Linda Cardellini is good as Alice's long-suffering, but loyal friend. Perhaps trimming some of the cast would have made for a bit tighter plot. I would have preferred one of the two brothers, the gay ex-husband, and Leigh be trimmed. They did not significantly advance the plot and just seemed to be in the movie to lend some weight through the popularity of the actors."
" Typical Hollywood take on mental illness:
",2018-05-09 00:00:00,4,"This film has a few chuckle worthy moments, but I find most of it cringe worthy. Whenever Hollywood decides to portray a mental health issue, it is almost always underplayed or just way over the top. As someone who has had BPD his entire life, I feel this film is a reflection of the second option. There are some elements of Alice's behavior that I can identify with, but certainly not too that extreme a degree. Just because someone has BPD it doesn't mean that they are a total train wreck. Even when we see Alice when she is ""medicated"", her behavior to me is unrealistic for someone with this condition ALONE. This is only my take based on my own experiences though, and realize that everyone's situation can be completely different from mine. If you want to get a more fact based, serious point of view on BPD, there are several good YouTube videos out there. This is just entertainment, which at the end of the day is really all it's intended to be, from a business point of view. Even on that basis alone though, I still don't find it as entertaining as a film like Lars and the Real Girl."
" Loved the performances but...
",2018-04-12 00:00:00,6,"First of: I LOVE Kristen Wig. She is a fantastic actress and so funny. She portrayed a woman with Borderline Personality Disorder exactly like it is.The main character winning the lottery and starting her own show was absolutely genius. But this movie did not go as expected. At least not for me. So when you watch this, let go of your expectation and just enjoy the show in a very literal sense. I couldn't really because I was waiting for something to happen. I can't give the movie away and I don't want the red spoiler alert, so I just can say the movie did not meet my expectations in the end. So in spite of the fantastic acting of everybody, the well done production and the good intentions, I will rate just 6 stars."
" Worst Movie Ever
",2018-03-09 00:00:00,1,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen. I felt the movie was a waste of time.The comedy in this movie is EXTREMELY deadpan, not an actual comedy movie, but rather someone who poured in money to get a movie up just like Alice did by buying her own tv show. Waste of time and leaves you feeling very crappy at the end of the movie. I suppose people who can relate to this situation IRL will appreciate the movie due to relatibility but for anyone else trying to enjoy a comedy movie, this is a horrible HORRIBLE movie. Not your typical funny movie to leave you with a light heart feeling great at the end. I regret every second I spent watching this movie thinking it would get better because Kristin Wiig was in it. Nope, it didnt. I think I lost interest in watching any of her movies moving forward."
" Like the World's Worse SNL Skit
",2018-03-02 00:00:00,1,"Like a car accident in the next lane, I watched 30 minutes of this, wondering if it was ever going to get any less uncomfortable. Eventually, I drove past the accident, then I couldn't even see it in my mirror, and I found something else to watch."
" Unique Perspective on Borderline Personality Disorder

" Wow and not in a good way
",2017-07-12 00:00:00,3,"Truly bizarre. I feel like 2 precious hours of my life have been held down and molested. This movie is reminiscent of a low budget one woman show that no one even wants free tickets to. I even dusted off this account just so I could complain about how bad it was. Now if you'll excuse me, I am in desperate need of a shower to cleanse myself of this rubbish."
" This movie is not only offensive, but damaging to those with BPD
",2017-06-20 00:00:00,1,"The director & writer should be ashamed of this film. All it does is spread MORE misinformation, misrepresent a horribly excruciating problem, and on top of that, exploits those with it.This is not even close to an accurate depiction of BPD, and this film will only do one thing- further stigmatize this horrible affliction, making people even more hateful & cruel, which is already a bad enough problem right now.Their complete misunderstanding of the disorder is nauseating. Don't see this movie. Don't see any movie about a character with BPD, because it has always been done ridiculously poorly & has stigmatized those with it further. To a huge degree.If you want to actually learn a bit about it, go to Wikipedia, and you will find a very accurate detailing of the disorder, without bias, prejudice or ignorance."
" Interesting but not entirely satisfying
",2017-02-14 00:00:00,7,"Welcome to Me is a distinctly odd movie about a woman with a boderline personality disorder diagnosis and millions of dollars in lottery winnings who decides to have a vanity TV show all about her. It's an interesting idea, and it kept my attention, but I feel it wasn't quite the movie it might have been.First off I'd like to talk about borderlines, because I've known a couple. Googling around I've found a few articles describing this movie as either a good or bad portrayal of BPD. Since BPD simply means you exhibit a large number of traits from a list (impulsivity, self-harm, etc.), Alice is acceptable as a borderline. And since being borderline can exist with other conditions, like depression or narcissism, you can't really complain about less typical borderline behavior.That being said, Alice doesn't seem like borderlines I've known, and lacks some commonly known BPD qualities. For example, borderlines are often very good at feigning normalcy. I once saw a BPD friend, ranting and raving after sneaking out of a psyche ward and trying to kill herself, instantly become calm and rational when the cops came to check on her. Many psychiatrists don't like working with borderlines because they can feel tricked when that patient convinces their doctor that they're fine now right before a suicide attempt. Alice, on the other hand, is just purely odd. And her oddness seems to come entirely from her mental illness. It is as though Kristen Wiig was so concerned with getting the symptoms right that she never thought about who Alice would be without her mental illness. But in truth, people with mental illnesses have traits that have nothing to do with being mentally ill (although some psychiatrists do try to fit everything about their patients into their diagnosis).Because of this, Alice is an interesting character but not a really compelling one. Meanwhile, the intriguing premise never quite gels. Is the movie a satire of celebrity and our fascination with trashy talk shows? Is it an attempt to portray mental illness? Is it an attempt to get laughs out of mental illness? I never really felt this movie had a vision, or a point of view. Like the main character, the story feels like it's a bunch of ideas stuck together rather than a cohesive drama.While the movie feels a little undercooked, I did enjoy it. Wiig may seem more like a mildly autistic narcissist than a borderline, and the story may feel unsubstantial, but it is amusing to watch Alice create her entirely peculiar show and get into weird dietary fixations. The movie may not make a coherent whole, but the pieces are pretty good in themselves."
