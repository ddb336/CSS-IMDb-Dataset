" Enjoyably funny
",2021-03-22 00:00:00,8,"Always appreciate Depp for choosing to do the quirky, unorthodox roles that only he does so well, regardless of how the overall movie fares in terms of critique and/or box office gross."
" What with these reviews
",2021-03-19 00:00:00,10,This movie is brilliant üëè it had me laughing the whole time i was watching it.
" Terrible
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,1,Pathetic attempt to be funny with Depp totally out of his depth
" It's OK
",2021-02-23 00:00:00,5,"I'd not heard of this film before despite the stars studded cast, but I understand why. I guess it didn't develop any buzz, no recommendations as the must see comedy of 2015. The only reason I watched it was that it was top of the list of movies about to leave Amazon Prime (I don't know how long it went unnoticed on Prime) only 6 days left.I'd recommend a course of Botox before watching. I actually spent the whole film with with a puzzled expression as I can't believe they made this in this century. I'll need to spend the day trying to smooth out my now wrinkled brow. I do love the old Carry Ons, Pink Panther movies (with Peter Sellers), St Trinians, etc, but I only score those 6 or 7 on IMDb. It was OK, but certainly formulaic."
" Mortis it is not...
",2021-02-20 00:00:00,8,"Not the greatest film by any means,but definitely good fun for my tastes, harkens back to a Inspector Clouseau bumbling idiot feel, which I miss nowadays.Want Depp's best works,avoid.Want lighthearted fun and a smile when bored?
Do come in..."
" Highly entertaining.
",2021-02-19 00:00:00,9,"I'm a huge fan of the Carry On Films, so Depp's very Leslie Phillips-esque portrayal of Mortdecai complete with amusing facial expressions and tongue in cheek witty one liners made me chuckle. As he was accompanied by a talented cast who threw themselves into their respective roles in an over the top farcical caper with a clever plot twists thrown into the silliness, I was hooked. I've always been a sucker for a good spoof and for me, this is just that, a fun film which doesn't take itself too seriously and I found it highly entertaining."
" Do something else!
",2021-02-13 00:00:00,1,"If you have nothing to do and you can waist 2 hours of your life; then go find something else to do. This movie sucks. Not funny, not entertaining, not worth the time."
" Sticky and Silly.
",2021-02-10 00:00:00,7,"I'll say the film was much like a spoof Pink Panther although I will say that the overall altitude is quite catchy. I did find myself aspiring to be like Mortecai because as it seems, humor and childishness will take you further than only charm. I think a great moral speaks throughout the film, this is why I chose to watch it again. Depp is a fantastic character, I think it's a sincere role. Depp goes for these feminist and all true roles, this is why we love him. A fabulous recount of what it would be like to live in a spoof sticky. I love it."
" Garbage- just utter garbage
",2021-01-29 00:00:00,1,This is the third worst movie that I have seen all year. This truly is a disgrace. This idea could have been so much more-SO MUCH MORE! There wasn't a single time I laughed during watching this. Never under ANY circumstance watch this
" Ignore the low score, this film is hilarious
",2021-01-19 00:00:00,8,"I found the film to be very funny. It's silly, of course, but funny nonetheless. There genuinely are people like Johnny Depp's character. I used to know a few when I lived in London. Totally bonkers, head-in-the-clouds, shockingly out-of-touch, asset rich but somehow pretty skint. I read a couple of scathing reviews and honestly disagreed with them both entirely. I found the film to be very funny. It's silly, of course, but funny nonetheless.

Who are all these naysayers? And why don't they have a sense of humour?"
" Baffling
",2021-01-18 00:00:00,7,I really like this movie. But every time I think about it I am just completely baffled as to how it ever got made. Did Johnny Depp have that much clout and he wanted it? Was there a studio executive sitting around saying I really want to make a movie with Terry Thomas but he was informed today's audiences would not know who that was and he's been dead for 25 years so how about a gap-toothed mustachioed Johnny Depp? I don't know. But this is a very British movie made in America that most Americans won't like because it's too British and most British won't like because it's too American. Really who was the target audience? 3 people? Mr. Bean fans who want a little more of an R-rated flavor? So confusing. But if you like dry humor combined with broad slapstick you may like this. If you don't like Ealing Studios or Rowan Atkinson or don't know what those words are you probably won't.
" I liked it
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,7,"Well, I saw the movie and than I went to check the rating and was surprised how low the rating is. The movie is FUN. The actors are absolutely positively brilliant and I enjoyed the performances immensely. It's unpretencious and feels everyone aboard had good loughs making it."
" Johnny Depp
",2021-01-06 00:00:00,10,"I don't understand what all the bad reviews are about, I thought it was pretty enjoyable."
" A flawed Masterpiece based on literary gems
",2020-12-26 00:00:00,10,"Masterful performances by Paul Whitehouse and Paul Bettany as Jock. The books could have been interpreted more faithfully and the result would have been even better. But the underlying writing shines through. Casting British or Australian actors for the main roles would also have been better. See the film but also read the books by Kyril Bonfiglioli, and also his best work IMHO All the Tea in China about Charlie's Grandfather's exploits in the China trade."
" Really nice
",2020-12-24 00:00:00,10,Laughter remains same till the end.very enjoyable. its really sad to see Johnny depp is leaving the stage.very talented man of course
" A Modern Ealing comedies and I love it
",2020-12-16 00:00:00,9,"All I can say to critics who panned this movie ""Please remove head from nether regions before engaging mouth""
This movie reminds me of the Ealing comedies and what a wonderful breath of fresh air it is. Light, fast, surreal in places and a little naughty without crossing the line of being vulgar. Depp's loving homage to the classic Terry Thomas lovable cad character is wonderfully done. Gwyneth Paltrow's is a perfect compliment to Depp and Paul Bentley as the loyal and long suffering Jock is brilliant.
If you love Ealing comedies and you are willing to go with the flow you will have a great time"
" It's hilarious! ... Reviewers r either mean or just dumb to not get the humor...!
",2020-12-14 00:00:00,10,"Reminds me of Wooster and Jeeves from P G Wodehouse!The humorous and witty dialogues , Johnny Depp s acting the story line and the cinematography all score 10/10But the poor reviewers who rated it so low r either mean or just plain dumb and didn't watch it with subtitles , to not understand such a classic movie!Now I understand why silly idiotic, low IQ movies like THE BIG lebowski , pineapple express etc have such high ratings in US while really awesome movies like this one so low..."
" Very entertaining
",2020-12-07 00:00:00,8,"This is a funny screwball comedy, I don't understand why people are so negative about it. It's great fun. There are some particularly funny moments with Johnny Depp and Paul Bettany and Gwynneth Paltrow, though all the cast are very good. Reminded me of those old fashioned British comedies with Terry Thomas. Laughed out loud. Glad I got around to watching it."
" Fun film to watch. Laughed throughout
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,8,I don't get why so many reviewers didn't get this film. I found it funny. It was never supposed to be a take me seriously or based on real life events. No it's a purely fun film to entertain only and there is nothing wrong with that. Johnny Depps character is sooo blatantly aristocratic over the top he is hilarious. I don't know. Maybe you need to be British to understand or appreciate what he brings to the role. JD steals the scenes away from his cast mates. I found it a thoroughly entertaining and funny film which I have now watched several times and i am still discovering little innuendos here and there I missed.
" Funny and underrated
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,10,I honestly don't understand the hate this film gets. I laughed most the way through it. Silly movies are fun and enjoyable. Not everything has to have deep meaning
" Great Ridiculous Fun
",2020-11-11 00:00:00,8,Not sure why people don't like this movie. I just saw it for the first time and I couldn't stop laughing. Its so freaking ridiculous and over top. Enjoyed it immensely.
" Funny
",2020-11-10 00:00:00,10,"Very funny, I watched it with my best friend the first time because we are fans of Johnny Depp and we were only watching it because of him, not expecting anything else but it turned out we were having a blast! Same thing happened when we re-watched it, it's too good and definitely one of my favorite comedies."
" ""And what, pray tell, might you be doing whilst I'm engaged in thus heroics?""
",2020-11-07 00:00:00,7,"Thoroughly enjoyed this one. Hilarious from the first scene to the last! The dialogues were superb, acting was great, and the plot unpredictable!Ignore the naysayers; neither does the film project itself as an Oscar winning magnum opus, nor should it be judged in that manner. A goofy slapstick comedy, treat it like one.In it's own little genre comprising the likes of Johnny English, Pink Panther etc., it's an illustrious 9/10. In the grand scheme of things, I'd say 6.5."
" Johnny Depp's charisma at its peak
",2020-11-05 00:00:00,10,Hilarious movie! Johnny Depp and Paul Bettany are fantastic duo.
" Not what I had in mind.
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,4,"I was hoping this would be a little similar to ""The Tourist"", but it's not. I know Johnny Depp loves roles that border on ""odd"" or ""unusual"" characters. This just doesn't cut it for me."
" Hilariously Stupid
",2020-08-29 00:00:00,7,"If you're wanting a deep and meaningful movie, you've come to the wrong place. ONLY watch this movie if you're wanting to have a good time. It's so stupidly funny that its bound to make you feel better. Dont listen to the uptight reviews... give it a watch."
" Jock, are we going to be alright??
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,6,"Welcome to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's movie review is the comedy flick Mortdecai (2015) based on a series of novels the film centres on a suave art dealer and part time rogue Charlie Mortdecai played by the ever versatile Johnny Depp, who is trying to juggle bankruptcy, angry Russians, an international terrorist and a British Mi5 agent who is after his wife while trying to find a missing stolen painting that may contain hidden codes to a Nazi bank account rumored to be filled with gold. Depp's transformation as this moustache driven art dealer is goody and fun in particular his facial expressions and quick quips throughout the movie. His onscreen presence though isn't enough to make this move a good movie and tends to be riddled with sexual innuendos and is way to fast paced with some over the top scenes. There aren't too many laughs which is a shame as the scenes with comedic relief were quite fun.Some of the locations are lavish and lovely looking which makes the movie glossy as and kind of has a mix bag of the Pink Panther and an espionage film. What it needed was more humour rather than predictability. This can be blamed on the filmmakers with their script. Having said that there are a few scenes that cracked me up such as the gag moments between Depp and Gwyneth Paltrow and especially Paul Bettany playing as Jock, Mortdecai's manservant with an interesting cockney scent with a tough guy appearance - pretty much he babysits Depp's character so whilst Depp runs around running a mock. He is usually asked by his employer ""Will everything be alright in the end?"" The response from Jock - ""I don't know, sir"" and that's how the film is to me. Had no expectations, assumed it will be a flop of a movie but was definitely wrong. Its not a great film but totally has a few laughs in particular the quick back and forth quips between Depp and Bettany - too good and would have liked to seen more of it. Overall, a movie you can watch once have a few laughs but it isn't memorable and was wayyy too fast paced 6/10"
" Redneck
",2020-08-05 00:00:00,10,I'm just a dumb redneck! But I laughed my ass off! You just have to not take it seriously!
" Tiring & Boring
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,1,Johnny Depp is locked in this one character type he plays in every single movie. So tiring and boring. We couldn't get past the first 15 minutes.
" The greatest comedy ever?
",2020-07-11 00:00:00,10,"Despite what reviews say, yes some Americans actually truly love this movie. It came out at a time when audiences were maybe kind of sick of Depp at the time and his reputation was being dragged through the mud, and the trailer sucked.In reality, this is a delightful, hilarious movie that I have watched over and over again. It's like a comfort food movie for me. I'll throw it on at the end of the night and fall asleep to it all the time. I put it on if I'm depressed and need something silly to make me feel good.No it's not a flawless movie but it is one of my favorites. It makes me laugh every single time and if you haven't given it a chance, you should. No you probably won't love it as much as me but you probably won't hate it as much as you might expect either."
" A gem covered in mud of audience expectations
",2020-04-26 00:00:00,10,"Yes. This movie is not for everyone. I've read reviews and that's how I might have got lucky because I wasn't expecting much. In fact I was bought in by Gwyneth Paltrow who's my favorite actress. And I am glad I gave it a chance.The movie might seem vaguely strange to many people. We have here linear whodunit which story and characters are just so bizarre that the creators couldn't be serious. We know Johnny Depp from many roles being the fearless adventurer with whom you'd love to go to a bar and chat to know more. His every role was like this. But here we have this sleazy brat no one can sympatize with. And this is the gist. In this role Johnny Depp deflected from his heroic ensamble to anti-brave ambiguous individual. We liked his former roles and now it is very hard to confide in him when our expectations are in collision with what we experience here. And this is the reason why he got several anti-awards in my opinion. One has to have an open mind. And when you do the experience of the movie turns upside down. In fact, I believe his showmanship was excellent, I really enjoyed watching his wacky behaviour never seen before. Those little glimpses, frowns, sighs in precise moments and his dry british accent make this character complete and Johnny Depp such a good actor. It is a true addition to his other crazy roles we know him from. And I am really glad he found another, believing he really enjoyed having this one.In the matter of the whole movie I actually get the feeling all actors and crew really enjoyed making this movie because there is lightened atmosphere throughout the whole piece. Gwyneth, Paul and Ewan were magnificent and contributed fully to the pleasant drollery outcome as the movie is to me. Fast-pacing and easy-going story, enjoyable juicy music matching all scenes like a compelling narrator, original and ingenious jests many times hidden to the eye of the audience. I didn't laugh this much for a long time. This old-timer with modern approach is accodring to me an original gem never seen before and therefore I have to rate it 10/10. So thank you all!"
" boring and confussing
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,5,"This is an intensely strange movie with an off-beat sense of humor, most of which you probably won't quite find funny. Johnny Depp seems so strung out or burned out that he doesn't deliver many his lines clearly. There are a few funny moments, and personally I love the Pink Panther franchise, so I enjoyed some similarities there."
" Mortified
",2020-03-04 00:00:00,3,"Every now and then, a movie comes along that makes you ask the big questions. ""Did all these people lose a bet or something?"" ""How many favors got called in to make this?"" Seriously, how this many decent to respectable actors got roped into this mess astounds me.To its credit, it did get Depp to stop doing his Jack Sparrow bit for at least a little bit, though I'm not sure I'd really call this an improvement. Just about everyone else here is... I don't know that I'd say phoning it in but they're not exactly trying real hard either.The exception to me was Paul Bettany. He's doing something different as Jock and he seems to be having fun with it.This is a ridiculous movie. I suppose if you can roll with how goofy it is, you might have fun with it but none of it clicked with me except for the Bettany stuff. Still, it's not like wildly offensive or anything and would maybe make for decent background fodder."
" Hilarious movie with great wit and charm!
",2020-01-25 00:00:00,10,"I can't believe this film has such a low rating. It was hilarious. I have literally watched it 4-5 times in a span of a few days.Sure, it's somewhat predictable and there's nothing deep or revelatory here, but it's charming and funny. And if you pay attention, there's tons of jokes within jokes in this film.Paltrow is excellent as a loving yet mischievous counterpart to Depp's hilarious portrayal of Mortdecai. I definitely recommend this one."
" Not as bad as most reviews suggest
",2019-12-27 00:00:00,8,A decent comedy based on good material. Somehow hate for the lead actor seems to have resulted in the dismal performance and negative reviews. Not sure how many actually did see the movie before giving the reviews.Not the best comedy movie but better than the hangover movies.
" SMH
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,1,I couldn't even make it through the first 10 minutes. Why would Johnny Depp do this to himself?
" Will it be alright in the end?
",2019-12-15 00:00:00,8,"What a great movie. Funny with great characters and not even a hint of destroying everything in sight.
Obviously the people who didn't like it just didn't understand the type of humour.
Obviously due to the poor box office performance there will not be a sequel, more the shame."
" Highly underrated. Ignore the critics.
",2019-12-10 00:00:00,9,"Johnny Depp is hilarious channelling Terry Thomas in this quirky and highly original film that critics unfairly savaged for some reason. I'd say its his best performance since Ed Wood and certainly funnier than anything else released in the last 5 years. The story is very silly, but that's half the fun. There are some brilliant lines and it deserved a much better reception."
" Johnny Dreadful
",2019-11-26 00:00:00,2,"What the hell did i just watch? This was the worst Johnny Depp movie I've seen..
Paltro and McGregor seemed to realise the woeful scripts dumped upon them and have an equal measure of effort delivering their lines.
This movie failed on so many levels and not funny at all. Save almost 2 hours and do anything else than watch this"
" Cue the Narration
",2019-11-16 00:00:00,3,"This would be more forgiving if it were a film produced back in the 90's, but alas it was not. The trailer looked like it had potential, but it was just predictably unfunny. Depp's caricature became tiresome by the movie's end. Gwyneth Paltrow, on the plus side, scrubs up well."
" Terrible
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,2,"Johnny strikes out again. It's sort of comedic, and Gwenyth Paltrow is in it. It's about a billionaire.But it's a horrible movie. Not entertaining and a mind sore. Skip this one.2 stars"
" 5 stars Ballz. 8!
",2019-10-15 00:00:00,8,"I thought this was extremely funny, great performances, a pleasantly ridiculous storyline, and ""kooky"" direction. All good. üòÄ"
" View It With The Pink Panther In Mind
",2019-10-08 00:00:00,8,"I could see an over-the-top Peter Sellers in Johnny Depp. If you laughed at the physical comedy and word play of Pink Panther movies, you'll enjoy this."
" Not the Train-wreck Many Critics Would Have You Believe!
",2019-09-26 00:00:00,5,"Watching Mortdecai, I was reminded of Hudson Hawk, that Bruce Willis disaster of the early 90's. The films definitely have similarities, particularly in tone and plot, but Mortdecai, does have some genuinely amusing moments unlike its earlier running mate.This is not the complete failure Rotten Tomatoes and Meta-Critic would have you believe, though we all have to accept that it was very much a commercial failure. Can I just say at this point that the British do this sort of adventure /farce far better and more naturally than their Atlantic cousins. Take the Kingsman films for instance, which serve as fine examples of blending hyper-kinetic action scenes, with heavy comedic doses of both the physical and spoken variety. So I'm not really sure why more of the lead actors and production team members aren't British, though Scot, Ewan McGregor does his English counterpart pretty well. And as far as I'm concerned Gwynnth Paltrow's Johanna, is a movie highlight and one of the best reasons to see the film. I cannot understand how she would bag a Golden Raspberry nomination for her sexy, together, aristocratic wife, who refuses to stay at home and polish the silver.The action scenes are in the main dull, though come more alive when the comedy is emphasised. Depp pretty much gives us a modern reworking of Jack Sparrow, dry-docked. He needs to seek inspiration elsewhere for his own career well-being. The film is arguably around 15 minutes too long, though somewhat ironically, it best achieves its goals in the third act.It's just seems a pity that such a talent-laden team in a generously budgeted film, didn't get a better story, combined with a more experienced director of this particular sub genre. Mortdecai, as it stands, is a film probably best enjoyed by the curious, rather than the rusted - on Pirates of the Caribean Depp fan group."
" Bland movie that is easily forgotten
",2019-09-14 00:00:00,2,"What happened to Johnny Depp? I like that he is versatile and he has the most interesting, crazy, deep and/or funny characters, but even for Johnny this is just off.
I really tried to watch the whole movie, but I just couldn't. Very boring, did almost fell asleep. And it felt like Gwyneth and Johnny had zero chemistry and wondered why they are in the same movie. Awful concept and I don't even remember anymore what was the plot like."
" Great Movie
",2019-08-28 00:00:00,10,I was shocked this movie had such low ratings. It's a fantastic movie.
" One of Depp's best performances...
",2019-08-06 00:00:00,10,"I will never understand how this film was not a hit. I would rate Depp's performance right up there with Fear and Loathing. If you don't know who Terry Thomas is, you should probably find out and then watch this again, Better still, watch It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and THEN watch this again. Everything about this movie strikes the funny bone, including the random noises Depp uses throughout. I don't know, I just worry even more about the state of the world in general when people can't watch a movie like this and laugh."
" Thoroughly entertaining
",2019-08-03 00:00:00,9,"Any movie that makes me laugh and provides much needed escapism from the stresses of day-to-day life is a winner in my books. Depp was at his finest yet again, supported by a marvellous cast. Light hearted and well executed by all (those in front of and behind the camera). Thank you for the wonderful entertainment."
" Cheesy
",2019-08-01 00:00:00,3,"Suchet? Terry Thomas? Sadly not Sellers.
A banal attempt at humour/action.
No amount of supporting roles could raise this rotter.
The fact that Depp continues to land roles (& millions) given the flops he's ""starred"" in of late, is astounding.
He'd do better to return to drama & drop the Kwerk. üå†"
" Surprisingly Good
",2019-07-21 00:00:00,8,"I avoided this movie because I don't enjoy dated British romps. I was wrong. It is virtually identical in tone to those old films, with lots of double entendres and other silliness. It's not updated for a modern audience, but it is funny.
The casting is perfect and all the lead characters are portrayed with charm and comedic flair. Even the minor roles are done well.
Another win for the director is an amusing subplot with Paul Bettany that is woven in seamlessly, adding value without diverting attention.
There are also beautiful sets, a fast moving plot that makes sense, and clever, rapid fire dialogue. I watched it again (with subtitles) to catch all the details."
" Sorry, Depp and Palthrow cannot save this one.
",2019-07-17 00:00:00,3,"""Mortdecai"" is truly a bad film. Johnny Depp (over)plays the title character and can't even save his lackluster performance with some good ol' Jack Sparrow moves. And the rest of the cast? Well, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ewan McGregor has been given some of the most uninteresting characters they have ever played. Adding to that a total fail in terms of atmosphere and setting, ""Mortdecai"" shouldn't be watched by anyone who wants a laughter."
" Misleading score awarded to this gem
",2019-07-03 00:00:00,8,"You judge it on its own merits not what you decide it should be. It is funny and full of stars which alone is worth more than 5 or 6. Johnny Depp, Gwyneth Paltrow and Ewan McGregor amongst others would ensure a smooth production. They are professional actors with numerous credits and cannot be faulted in this film. There are a few scenes that were extremely funny. It has a good storyline and a satisfying conclusion. It is very English and maybe Americans are having a bit of a send up on British haughty systems of pomp and titles. It is a bit of fun and very entertaining with nothing offensive. It is clever and humorous and deserves a score of at least 8."
" We all wanted to like it but benefit of the doubt wasn't enough
",2019-06-23 00:00:00,4,"We want to like it.. and the characters! It's start studded with our favorites. Shows can succeed with nothing other than dialogue and actors we don't' know. The actors are fine, Jude is awesome, Ewan nails his part.. they play their roles, but the comedy just doesn't seem to come. Timing and tone of delivery seems spot on but the dialogue is a miss and I'm just not entertained. I feel like those that laugh at the first line of the first performer in stand up comedy night may have a good time with this one but no amount of warming up got me there. I really tried but sorry Johnny and crew, this is your first fail with me. Perhaps try to make likeable characters instead of some kind of verbal exchanges that fail to entrance on any level?"
" A terrible ""Pink Panther"" rip-off.
",2019-05-26 00:00:00,4,"If you wanted to see what the illegitimate film child of Wes Anderson and Guy Ritchie would be, this film would be it.
Of course, that would imply that this movie was any good. While it did have some amusing moments, the majority of it just struck me as a terrible ""Pink Panther"" rip-off with Johnny Depp doing his ""best"" Peter Sellers / Inspector Clouseau impression and Paul Bettany acting as a sort of hooligan ""Cato""."
" Surprisingly delightful
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,7,"This movie follows Mortdecai (Depp) an art enthusiast, his wife, man servant, and his old college friend (McGreggor) whom also happens to be in love with his wife and an agent for the government.
A painting is missing and Mortdecai uses his connections in the underground art scene to help his old friend track down the would be thief.
Quirky nuances and over the top British etiquette make every scene one to watch. The cast felt made for their roles and played off one another amazingly.
Even tho the ""critics"" have basically told this movie to ""show its balls"" don't be swayed. When do they ever get it right. If you are on the fence and in the mood for a light hearted funny mystery movie this is it."
" Not bad, some good moments
",2019-05-14 00:00:00,7,"One of Johnny Depp's rare movies where his odd personality fits the character. The movie isn't totally about him even though he is the main character. There are plenty of arcs in the story line and the characters are colorful.The story falls a little short at the end. It feels forced.
All star cast. Fairly consistent. Some goofs.
Very dry humor.Overall a good mystery comedy and worth a watch or two.
Keeps you guessing through the movie with out giving away too much"
" 3rd rate Austin Powers
",2019-04-21 00:00:00,1,This movie is just banking that hipsters and others that like that stupid little moustache will pay to see this dribble.
" Nothing here.
",2019-04-09 00:00:00,1,"Mortdecai is an unfunny and soulless film, lacking human feelings and qualities.Nothing about it's cringe-worthy or painful to watch, but there isn't a reason to watch it for."
" The Right Mood
",2019-03-05 00:00:00,8,"You have to just be in the right mood for this one, and tonight I was! I've had this movie forever, and my girl and I did watch but I don't think we actually got to finish it before for whatever reason, because I didn't remember anything after the first hour or so, so this was basically my first watch. Johnny is bumbling and wacky in this and he and Gwyneth are a hoot to watch, and Paul Bettany, Ewan McGregor and Olivia Munn are great too. This isn't a laugh riot, but it's a fun light hearted comedy that you might have to be a little English to understand! I loved it!"
" My husband and I love this movie
",2019-02-22 00:00:00,9,I really don't know how this has such a low rating. Mortdecai is one of my favorite Depp characters and this movie had my husband and I laughing the entire time. It's quirky and fun!
" great fun
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,8,"I'm amazed at the bad reviews. JD basically inhabits a character inspired by the Fast Show and does it brilliantly. Yes its not high brow, but it's a great attempt at comic genius, and nearly hits the mark. I loved it and loved the fact that JD gave this type of comedy a chance. Comedy is difficult and this is pretty bloody good."
" Sometimes a movie just needs to be entertaining...
",2019-02-06 00:00:00,7,"This is my first review here on IMDB and I will try to keep this very very short.This movie is a silly, comedy movie. It's funny and has no deep meaning. I love the way Johnny Deep plays in this movie and I like it alot. I think the reviewers should rate it for it's sillines and comedy instead of whatever they rating it on. Some movies are like this one and I like that. You can relax and watch it and laugh at it instead of always have a deep meaning to it. Movies are different and that's a good thing and sadly maybe that will not be the case when I look on the grades for movies like this one...I recommend it tho and if you like Johnny Depp you need to see it. I think he is hilarious in it."
" What a great, fun experience.
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,10,"This is an excellent movie pure and simple. Silly, adventurous with nice side plots."
" Laughed out loud
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,8,I thought this was really funny and Johnny Depp and Paul Bettany are just brilliant!
" Silly in just the right way
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,8,"If you're in the mood for some silly fun, this is a good movie choice. Johnny Depp is hilarious and Gwyneth Paltrow, Ewan McGregor and Paul Bettany are perfect counterparts. It was refreshingly free from clich√©s as well. I laughed many times."
" Such a fun movie, totally underrated!
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,9,"I'm surprised there are so many negative ratings on this movie, it was so fun watching it.First of all, let me say, gagreflex, haha!This movie is funny, smart, good actors and characters, great scenery and a good story.I would say it's one of Johnny depps better movies, Gwyneth, and Paul Bettany are really fun and they fit perfect as a team. Glad to see Ewan McGregor as well, he always performs well even though he is Obi-Wan to me ;)I would recommend this movie anyday! It's awesome!"
" I didn't think it was possible
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,10,"I'm a big fan of the Kyril Bonfiglioli trilogy. And I thought that it was not possible to film his books, keeping the style.
But thanks to the excellent play of Johnny Depp, Paul Bettany, Evan Makkregora, Michael Culkin and Gwyneth Paltrow it was possible.Thank you, Mr. Koepp, for the excellent film adaptation of the book Kyril Bonfiglioli!"
" Garbage!
",2019-01-06 00:00:00,3,"What a garbage! Shame on you all: director, screenplayer, actors. What a waste of money. Please, do not make something like this in future."
" Clever and funny
",2018-12-29 00:00:00,9,"Don't believe the bad reviews, I really enjoyed this movie!"
" Earn that paycheck Johnny
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,2,"Mortdecai is a movie that was made to go straight to airplane entertainment systems and motel lobbies. This nearly 2 hour march of boring and overplayed British cliches reminds you that the lead actor and his character share one vital trait: Monstrous debt in need of urgent repayment. The nauseatingly lifeless performance of Johnny Depp was only equaled in despair by a dizzying and idiotic plot, impossible for the adult mind to follow. A clear lack of intelligence in the writer's room led to what are no doubt some of the laziest, most crass and unamusing jokes ever to escape a moron's lips on the big screen. In conclusion, this uninspired, unambitious, agonizing trash heap of a film is hardly suitable for even the most heinous of criminals, or labotomy patients."
" Funny enough
",2018-12-24 00:00:00,6,Rich comedy following a stolen painting of high value. Silly comedy in high society. Amusing would be the word.
" Che?
",2018-12-23 00:00:00,1,This is definitely the most stupid movie I have ever seen (period).
" So sorry to have watched it.
",2018-11-15 00:00:00,1,"Thoroughly painful, I am so sad that this movie was seriously produced."
" A fun, quirky film with a great cast
",2018-10-03 00:00:00,8,"I loved this film. Not one of the best ever, but it was well cast and the music was quirky and suited the mood. I'm not a fan of Mr. Depp but he was amusing. A throwback to the old whodunnits. Set your sights low and enjoy it as it unfolds."
" Don't believe them movie snob haters
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,7,"This movie deserves more credit than 5.5/10. It 1h47m of quality laughter. Don't mind all the movie snob critics that gave it below a 6 or 7, please watch and enjoy the ride!"
" Quirky story but not all that funny.
",2018-08-25 00:00:00,4,"I went in to this movie expecting to enjoy Johnny Depp being a bumbling character, since I rarely dislike a film he is in. After watching almost the entire film I found that there wasnt much in the way of humor; it seemed like the person who wrote the script kept forgetting who the target audience is and how to make humor for them. According to most reviewers of this film, the reason for my lack of finding the film humorous is due to the fact that i just ""didnt get it' or I dont understand the humor. This might be shocking to some of the reviewers but it is possible to understand why something should be funny, get where the humor is coming from or any other variables like this and not find that thing funny. Another issue with the humor was repeating the same statement or action as funny that wasnt great the first time. I also didnt understand why they presented Johnny Depps character in a way that its impossible to root, support or have sympathy for him. 
Since the film was geared to be comedy and not a drama or action film, without portions that make you laugh the story itself becomes pointless. I Dont blame the actors for this lacking humor because i doubt they were the lines who decided to repeat phrases over and over that werent funny the first time or have their character being reprehensible at worst and wooden at best. This could have been a great movie if the actors could have played their characters less juvenile, the dialog wasnt as hokey, and fhe writers knew their target audience. Its too bad that the humor wasnt the dark or dry humor i love because this film had the plot, story, setting and cast to be a hilarious."
" An absolute shower
",2018-07-19 00:00:00,2,"I couldn't stay the distance with this film. An American actor playing the part of Terry Thomas (or it seems that way to me) but without the charm or authenticity of the original. Johnny Depp is capable of such great things (Ed Wood, The Ninth Gate) but the exagerated facial expressions here are the same as those for Jack Sparrow, and the accent is forced and overcooked. There is simply no humour in this film. It's childish and silly in ways that are neither charming nor clever. It lacks integrity. It's a collection of daft scenes, joined together by hapless, inane dialogue and the undoubted belief that 'because it's Johnny Depp it's automatically great'... it isn't. Neither is it based in any form of 'truth' that the viewer can relate to. Stupid cheese gags, comedic 'moments' with knowing glances and head tosses to add style to the proceedings... but all fall flat. This is comedy that explains itself, that has no subtlety or connection with the tradegy of the human condition.Watch 'Father Ted', 'Steptoe & Son', 'Fawlty Towers', 'Flight of the Conchords'. These are about life, people, the absurdity of the modern world. Mortdecai, in contrast, is a film about nothing, no-one, no place, no time.Gwyneth Paltrow phones it in and Ewan McGregor is wasting his time here. Where does the money come from to write, film and promote this kind of film? There's so much talent out there looking for a break, and yet here we are again with a big star vanity project, missing the mark by a mile.Two out of ten. For me it's a stinker."
" Maybe I just like bad movies
",2018-07-14 00:00:00,9,I saw this movie with my family a few years ago because of Depp and McGregor and we all ended up laughing the whole time and enjoying it. I'm not saying it's up for best picture or anything but it's certainly a movie you can pop in and get some laughs out of.
" Fun
",2018-06-07 00:00:00,9,"Reminded me of Harry Lime, Orson Welle's bungling con-artist and Peter Seller's Pink Panther - 
lovely flick"
" Definitely Underrated
",2018-06-02 00:00:00,7,"The film was very good, funny. It seems is underrated on imdb. We had grate moment while watchin it."
" Smart, well-waxed adventure comedy ! ! !
",2018-05-18 00:00:00,8,"Folks who generally panned this film didn't appreciate the clever tongue-in-cheek satire of the typical comedy adventure. The wordplay and the spot-on ""Britishisms"" alone make it worth a look, but the tension is kept up wonderfully by a great chemistry between beautiful Gwyneth and Depp. No expense was spared to show beautiful homes and scenery, costumes and the stunning Olivia Munn. Think P.G. Wodehouse's ""Jeeves and Wooster""...if you enjoy that read and/or British TV rendering (which is ABSOLUTELY great, by the way), you will enjoy this film. Paul Bettany turns in a stellar support as the versatile butler/aide-de-camp. I found many amusing scenes and some very much laugh out loud ones as well. Please do not let the negative box office and some poor reviews discourage you. The wide audience just didn't get it, but I think you will love it ! ! !"
" HILARIOUS!
",2018-05-16 00:00:00,10,What's wrong with people??? This movie was hilarious from start to finish! I just don't know what some people are looking for in movies sometimes.....
" Churchill Bulldog
",2018-04-17 00:00:00,7,"Charley Mortdecai (Johnny Depp) is a dubious art dealer and owes a lot of money. When a valuable painting goes missing and involves a murder, Charley is requested to help recover it. Charley doesn't have sex with his wife Johanna (Gwyneth Paltrow) as she is repulsed by his mustache and has a gag reflex every time they kiss. Meanwhile Alistair (Ewan McGregor) who has requested Charley is in love with Johanna and has no mustache.The plot is a bit boring, however it is the individual scenes and dialogue that make the film enjoyable. Charley is inept and has a man servant do all his dirty work with consequences.Guide 3 F-bombs. Back nudity. sex."
" Mortdecai has all the finesse of a homeless person's moustache.
",2018-04-14 00:00:00,3,"Oh Johnny, why must you do this? Sometimes you can say no, in fact it's good to say no when you are given this absolute drivel. A dash of 'Austin Powers', a splash of 'Pink Panther' and a colossal uninspired sprinkle of 'The Tourist' (which we all know wasn't great anyway). So what has Mr Depp graced us with his presence this time? Rich stupid useless man is recruited by inspectors to obtain a painting that holds a secret. Mildly amusing, occasionally watchable but I just...don't...get it. Why? Did they really think they could pull off an 'Austin Powers' spoof with Johnny Depp pretending to be British harnessing a moustache and an all too similar Jack Sparrow impersonation? Painfully unfunny, I mean I didn't laugh once...or even smile. The acting was questionable, with some very unusual casting choices. Bettany as a ""man slave"", Paltrow as a busty wife, Munn's a nymphomaniac (plausible I guess) and McGregor is just himself again. A committed central performance from Depp who always will be one of the best character performers in modern Hollywood, with Mortdecai being another memorable character. Yet the script is so horrendously dull that it gives no life to these characters. It's as if the story was brushed with a moustache comb, ridiculously fine yet with no soul. I didn't care where the painting was, heck I just wanted to laugh at something! Literally anything! Annoyingly, the film is only 107 minutes long and yet somehow felt like a good (well, bad...) 130 minutes. The narrative simply comprised of set pieces where stupidity ensues and Mortdecai exclaims ""beluddy hell, ma sympafetik gag refwex!"". The film takes itself utterly seriously, it really does and it shouldn't have done at all. This simply should've been a spoof, nothing more. Unfunny, weirdly acted, stupidly slow and just overly strange. Will this be a cult classic in years to come? I hope not. But hey, it's not the worst film I've ever seen, and if anything I did take away the important message of: ""everyone needs a Jock""...*cough*."
" Tries just a bit too hard to be funny
",2018-04-10 00:00:00,7,"Johnny Depp produced this comedy, which tries just a little bit too hard to be funny. Like THIS is a joke, and NOW you can laugh. Actors are good, but they overdo it. Would have worked better if the acting had been more down to earth and not so over the top.First time I saw it I was smitten with it. That's what most people will do: see it once. I have seen it 4 times now, because I loved this Depp flick so much at first watch. But later on, the childish jokes began to nag a little bit.Despite all my little criticisms ""Mortdecai"" is still an enjoyable popcornmovie with lots of laughs about Johnny Depp and Gwyneth Paltrow who both play with hilarious british accents. Story: they are in debt as a couple and have to sell a very precious painting, that gets stolen. The story really doesnt matter though. The story is just an excuse for lots of chases, lots of thefts and some smart contricks. And Depp and Paltrow are just a lovely and hilarious couple and they truly are the real stars of this flick. Could have been better though, but it is enjoyable nonetheless if you are into some childish ("" I have to throw up "") jokes. And however nasty that may sound, the ""vomit"" joke is actually one of the funniest! All in all a strange balance between adult and childrens jokes. For whomever likes the sorts of Rowan Atkinson, will probably enjoy this flick as well."
" Worth A Watch Once
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,6,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to Mortdecai.There are many ways for a movie to go wrong, and this one goes wrong in many of the most obvious ways. It has a generic story, bad writing, a lead with a dodgy accent trying too hard, the wrong director and despite a laugh or two, it's no fun.This is the third collaboration of Depp and Paul Bettany. The pair previously worked together on The Tourist and Transcendence. Bettany remembered: ""Johnny asked me if I'd ever read the Mortdecai books. I hadn't, and he gave me all of them. Afterwards, Johnny mentioned he was going to make them into a film, and asked if I wanted to play Jock."" Depp said that while Bettany is not known as a comedic actor, he is one of the funniest people around.I did laugh once or twice and I discovered Gwyneth Paltrow has a nice ass too. But overall, it's a tough one to say good things about. Mortdecai grossed $23 million at the domestic box office."
" I giggled through the whole thing
",2018-01-05 00:00:00,9,"I don't understand the bad reviews, I thought it was hilarious. Depp's best character yet. I love silly, witty dialogue and this is chock full of it. It doesn't hurt that it is also visually gorgeous. Love the Rolls!"
" Very amusing and entertaining
",2017-12-10 00:00:00,8,"I could almost name this movie as a parody to the 007 genre but I won't do it because I think this is so much more than that. Johnny Depp once again shows us a character that if done by someone else would be quickly forgotten, but his way of acting makes us believe in the character and laugh with it.The story, the scenery and even the Rolls Royce was a nice selection to a movie that so many people apparently don't understand what it is. Those who do appreciate the constant innuendos and the carefully executed humorous gags do have some fun throughout the movie and know ""everything will be OK in the end!""Is it worth watching? Absolutely!"
" worth a look
",2017-04-30 00:00:00,8,"This movie isn't memorable, but it was well made and funny. It's basically just a character study, which is why people are complaining about it. If it is a character study about serious subjects critics rave and call it poignant. But often times if it's a character study about a goofy person people bark and complain. It reminds me of Husdon Hawk in the late 80's which got panned and attacked, but which I also liked. Both movies are worth seeing, neither are classic, but if every worth while movie was a classic, where would classics be?"
" ""Kissing a man without a mustache is like eating an egg without salt.""
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,7,"A very short plot summary: Mortdecai (Johnny Depp) is a shady, but broke, art dealer who is hired by the British government to help locate a lost painting that may led to a fortune in hidden Nazi treasure. I don't get the hate swirling around Mortdecai. I've seen it called garbage, unfunny, a waste of time, etc. etc. etc. Mortdecai is the second film I've seen this week dealing with a lost Goya that may hold the key to a lost Nazi fortune (how bizarre - two movies about missing Goya's?). The other movie is the dreadful 7 Golden Women Against Two 07. For all those who have written negatively about Mortdecai, please take the time to watch the other movie I've mentioned. You will see what a truly horrible film really looks like. You'll beg to watch Mortdecai again. I admit Mortdecai's not perfect (the film could have been trimmed by 20 minutes to make for a tighter, better experience), but Mortdecai can't begin to compare to the pain that a really bad movie will inflict on your senses.Obviously, I enjoyed Mortdecai. I've seen someone call it a good old-fashion romp - I couldn't agree more. It's fun and often quite funny. There were moments that had me laughing out loud. In addition to the comedy, the action set-pieces really stood out, featuring some nice car chases and over-the-top fight scenes. The acting was top-notch. I found Depp's affected Mortdecai extremely funny. Ewan McGregor and Gwyneth Paltrow show a real comedic flair. And Paul Bettany steals every scene he's in. Very funny stuff!"
" No no no no. Just no.
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,3,"I tried. I really did. About an hour into this, without a single laugh coming out of my mouth. Without me caring a bit about the story or anything in the movie, I had to just turn it off. I literally couldn't take another second of this movie. It is just an unfunny comedy. The characters could have been interesting but you just find them annoying if not anything else. What a mess. What a crime! Look at the freaking cast for this film! Freaking A-listers! I am so mad at how much this film su@ks that I don't even want to know who directed this. Trust me, this film isn't even good enough to fall asleep to on some random and boring night because you will just be waxed off with the film. Whatever, I'm over it."
