" The Essence of a Good Monster Film
",2021-03-26 00:00:00,9,"I think that the best monster films are the ones that don't focus on the monster. They focus on the people. That's why I enjoy zombie stories. They don't focus on the zombie as unfortunate victims. They concentrate on people, like us, who aspire to be survivors.That's why I enjoyed ""The Monster"" so much. Zoe Kazan as the mother and Ella Ballentine as the daughter turned in solid believable performances. I would have given it a ""10"" except that the ending (no spoilers) felt like the writer, Bryan Bertino, (who was also the director) painted himself in a corner and chose a resolution that makes the audience wonder why this wasn't done earlier in the plot. That still doesn't detract from the sterling performances.One other shout out that I'll give is to whoever decided to hire Chris Webb to play a really scary creature. It was a pleasure to get a break from excessive CGI. Most of my favorite classic monster films rely on people in suits or in extensive prosthetics. It's nice to see the tradition continue."
" Misunderstood and not a horror film.
",2021-03-13 00:00:00,7,"The flashbacks in this film tell the story and ""The monster"" was metaphorical. The acting was incredible. The story is sad, but an accurate description of addiction and the destruction it leaves it in path. Worth the watch."
" Not Worth It
",2021-02-28 00:00:00,2,"The only good thing about this movie is the acting from the little girl. She did a great job. I found the movie too disjointed and the plot jumped around too much. I appreciate the effort made to build suspense, but when you drag suspenseful moments on and on AND ON you lose the suspense and it just becomes tedious and dull. The behavior of the characters is mind-boggling and the ending is just ridiculous. Save yourself the snooze fest and watch a different movie."
" Solid genre-bending
",2021-02-26 00:00:00,7,"People are too hard on this, and I believe the main reason is marketing. The movie is very difficult to be sold. It's not a straight up horror and not just a drama. So I believe this will be much more enjoyed by people who love both of the genres, who don't have issues with genre bending, and don't really care about the genre before they start watching a movie.Good acting, good monster design, emotional, very well directed. Yeah, a basic plot (if you only look to the main story) and some unrealistic choices by the characters. But it's solid, very solid."
" Better than expected
",2021-02-15 00:00:00,7,"The movie is well built, well acted and not bad at all. The monster is not scary at all in my opinion though. If it was made scarier, instead of looking like a creature out of alien, the movie would be perfect"
" Monster
",2021-02-12 00:00:00,7,Once in a while a little gem of a horror movie comes along . This is one of them .
" Good film ruined by some stupid writing
",2021-02-09 00:00:00,5,"This could have been one of those darling indie gems that people still talk about 20 years after it was made. Instead it's reduced to complete mediocrity by some of the most bizarre writing you'll ever come across.The story is simple, it's about a mother and daughter who's strained relationship, leads to them taking a road trip to drop the daughter off at her fathers, where it appears she won't be coming back from.
The car breaks down on an isolated stretch of road in the woods and they get stalked by some nasty creature. There's obviously more to it than this, there's a lot of flashbacks to show how they got to this stage but this is pretty much the gist of it.This film is a drama with some horror elements to it and I'm fine with this. It's never dull, It's well acted and shot and the sound design is absolutely stunning. The monster is really well done, is completely practical, so no cheap CGI and it is genuinely intimidating.
There were a couple of scenes where I really did jump out of my seat and there's some great tense moments in the film. But then as the film wore on, the writers just seemed to give up.Some of the character decisions towards the end of the film are head scratching, they make no sense and are really bizarre and just downright stupid.Spoilers ahead!!!It's made clear that the monster in the film is sensitive to bright light, the 2 leads are trapped in a crashed ambulance which is lit up inside, they have a torch and equipment to make fire if they need to. So why not sit tight until the sun comes up and wait for the creature to run away somewhere dark?
Instead, both mother and daughter come up with one of the most ridiculous plans of escape I've ever seen. It's senseless. There's scenes where both of them could quite easily escape but instead choose to mess around and approach the creature.And don't even get me started on the films climax, all I'm going to say is that this monster must be made out of crushed firelighters or solid paraffin because it literally bursts into flames when confronted with a lighter and a can of spray. This big powerful beast can bulldoze a moving ambulance off the road, smash through car windows and tear people apart like they're paper but it is literally killed with a single burst from a spray can, a lighter and a few whacks from a 12 year old girl holding a tree branch, it's ridiculous.It's worth watching just for how well made and acted it is and how cool the monster looks but don't expect any kind of logic, especially towards the end.It could have been a classic in the making but instead, it seems the writers just ran out of ideas on how to complete this story.
Such a shame."
" That Poor Monster!
",2021-02-04 00:00:00,1,"After the first five minutes of this wretched film, I was rooting for the monster long before it finally made its appearance to tear apart the two most unlikable characters in the history of film, i.e., a foul mouthed, alcoholic, brain-dead mother, and a neurotic, whiny, perpetually terrified, annoying brat. Almost every word of dialogue between these two losers is either sobbed or screamed. No character in the film behaves with any common sense, including two EMT's with a severely injured patient and a lesser injured one who instead of driving posthaste to the nearest hospital decide to look for the monster in the dark woods, with predictable results."
" A low-budget but tense little thriller
",2021-02-01 00:00:00,6,"This is a very low budget movie that is nearly just a cast of two. Although it takes place outside (sort of), it is really most confined to one small stretch of road, bounded by woods on either side. Yet it is surprisingly effective despite the constraints.Zoe Kazan plays Kathy, mother to Lizzy (Ella Ballentine). Zoe is a woman with coping skills that leave a lot to be desired, as do her decision making skills. Lizzy is a whip-smart kid who probably has her mother figured out better than mom does herself. Unfortunately, Kathy is also a verbally and sometimes physically abusive mother. The two set on a trip, and their drive goes into the night. Through a series of flashbacks (throughout the film), we see just how rock-bottom the relationship between the two has become. We understand a bit more about Kathy (who suffers abuse at the hands of the men in her life), and we also see how Lizzy really mothers Kathy. All-in-all, they make a sad pair. Really, actually, it's pretty rare to see a genre flick with this kind of extremely dysfunctional and abusive relationship between parent and child. We struggle to like Kathy at all, and we feel sympathy for Lizzy, who is a little tough to like herself.On a stretch of fairly lonely road, they have an accident wherein they run into some kind of creature, who is big enough to render their car inoperable, and also big enough to get away from the collision quite intact. This is ""The Monster"" of the title, and he's fairly creepy. Kathy & Lizzy call for help, but they are also forced to care for themselves. They are put through a night of terror.Aside from just trying to scare the viewer, the film also explores how these two characters pull together, and how perhaps Kathy can find some redemption in trying to save her kid and how Lizzy recognizes that she loves her mother despite it all. It's a sad but convincing undercurrent. And also convincing is the amount of terror these two experience. They are scared nearly out of their wits, and that just makes sense. What they witness and what they face SHOULD scare the daylights out of anyone. The film really tries hard to make these two not just cookie-cutter horror movie stereotypes. The effort is largely (but not always) successful. The events of the end of the movie become a bit ""plot-heavy"" and not everyone behaves in rational ways. While it's a scary little film, there are nonetheless those moments when you want to yell at the screen at the stupid things a character is doing. So the plot is a little wobbly.The film still pays off pretty well, and I still recommend it. Kazan and Ballentine are both terrific (It's really a new kind of role for Kazan). The editing and cinematography is well-done given the extreme constraints of the setting. I even appreciated that all effects were of the practical kind...no CGI here.This is not a classic film and will not be in the pantheon of great horror movies. But for 90 minutes, I was pretty nicely on the edge of my seat, and sometimes, that's really all you want or need from a nifty little horror film."
" Wow is this bad!
",2021-01-26 00:00:00,2,"Such a lame movie. Bad on so many levels I don't know where to start. Plot, story, writing..... It's all bad. Don't waste your time and make the mistake out of giving it a shot... it's not worth a shot."
" More direction than script but ... very good.
",2021-01-15 00:00:00,8,"The Moster is a film that bases everything on the staging (fantastic) and the performances of the main actresses (impressive). So little to criticize. Quite the contrary. I love these movies: a minimal but visceral story with heart and intense and believable performances. Seriously, this is way better than the majors blockbusters. Congratulations to its creators for these 90 minutes of tension, entertainment and human realism."
" Ending was little bit good other than that THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,5,I just wanna suggest you to watch the last half part of movie of you want to save your time.BTW last wasn't also that much good believe me
" Coming of age with monsters
",2021-01-10 00:00:00,6,"The plot summary tells the whole story.
There is a monster, gore and death.
But for me this is more about the conflict between the alcoholic mother and the
far too soon grown daughter. With flashbacks we see the not very good childhood of Lizzy. Her companion during that time is a plush teddy. And the monster destroyes this teddy..aka ending her childhood and with that she lost her fears and can destroy the monster.
Good even if a little minimalistic acting from both Kazan and Ballentine.
Good camera.
It's a movie that only success because of the atmosphere between mother and daughter....but it is nothing that you would remember.....just a one time watch and forget movie."
" So so
",2021-01-09 00:00:00,5,"Not terrible not great. At an hour and thirty it did seem much longer. You never want to look to long at believability, it's a monster movie after all, but I can't get past the deserted country road with street lights every 30 feet. Wolves and monsters all tend to shy away from those urban trappings lest they be discovered and thereafter hunted and killed. Ambulances, tow trucks, cell phones and so much blood and not a cop to be seen. Ok it's a movie, enough, got to roll with it to get through it. Still a middling effort deserving of a middle type grade. Watchable not memorable"
" The Monster
",2021-01-04 00:00:00,5,"A mother drives her daughter to see her father but breaks down in the middle of nowhere after hitting something. They are stalked by a vicious creature.Whilst this is an unremarkable tale of a monster in the woods, it is told effectively with the monster kept largely hidden resulting in considerable tension and pleasingly few jump scares. Both leads give believable performances both in terms of their rising terror and in flashbacks showing their growing family conflict. So overall well made and worth catching, but nothing new."
" A textbook exercise in building suspense.
",2020-12-03 00:00:00,7,"This one is pretty good! And it is good because it does all the basics right and introduces a small bit of fresh view.The fresh part is the relationship with the mother and the daughter which is exceptionally sour but eventually progresses as they face hardships together. Now, this is by no means the first movie to do it but it's definitely better than the ""put a child in the movie to justify that character's extreme actions"" approach that is so prominent.It also builds suspense quite well. The setting is minimalistic, with a couple of cars and very few characters pulling the entire movie. The background is mostly black, rain and the occasional headlight, without it being so dark that it's incomprehensible. Where so many modern movie just throw everything AND the kitchen sink on the screen in hopes that everyone finds at least a couple of things to like, this movie uses a sniper rifle to deliver instead of a machine gun spray and pray. The characters are allowed enough time to become likeable and to grow and develop so by the end you will likely find yourself rooting for them.That being said, the movie is better before the monster is revealed. It ends up being uninspired and mundane like a toothy gorilla that's been rolled around in the tar pits. It also can either move at lightning speed when it's supposed to carry off a huge corpse or it can just sit there, contemplating metaphysics, while the protagonists put their plan to defeat it into action. It's all very silly.Despite the lackluster monster everything else the movie does is so well crafted that it will keep you at the edge of your seat and is definitely worth the watch."
" Below average monster flick
",2020-10-26 00:00:00,4,"I'm sorry to say that despite having a nice visual touch and good audio, this movie is a dud.The script is overlong and tedious. The constant screaming and crying is grating. Why does a 10 minute story need to be dragged out to an hour and a half?The acting was alright form the two female protagonists, but the background story of the mother being abusive horrid wretch was a little too much and detracts from the monster story.4/10 needs a lot of work to make this more enjoyable and it is a missed opportunity."
" Monster vs monster mom
",2020-10-06 00:00:00,1,I don't think I've ever watched a film wanting the main character to be killed off as much as the mother in this film!!!
" Stellar leads, but something's wrong here
",2020-09-09 00:00:00,5,"First, a defense of the slow-burn psychological horror genre: this is the wilderlands of beautiful cinematography, intrepid emotional content and films which, I believe, elevate horror as a genre beyond the stereotypical gore-fest, jump scare prone fodder many of us expect from horror. And this film would fall squarely into that category. It's low budget with a heart. It's minimal yet meaningful. It's surprisingly well acted. So how does it manage to bore me to death?Unfortunately, there's some filmmaking etiquette which The Monster seems painfully unaware of, like that awkward miscreant at a gala who can't figure out which utensils to use in what order. This film feels a little out of its own league in some ways. But first, the good.Our dynamic duo leads start a little stale, but quickly overwhelm the screen with heartfelt emotional moments and painfully authentic chemistry which really wrenches your gut on a few occasions as you watch Lizzie suffer through her mom's debilitating addiction issues. Casting, especially for a low-budget like this, is really quite good, and the saving grace of this film. The acting alone is worth four of the five stars represented here.The filming is good. Not groundbreaking, but very decent for a film of this caliber. It is, at points, a nicely atmospheric flick, although the visuals can get tedious after the hour mark, with little variation and overuse of what seemed effective earlier in the film.Pacing, though, is where this film begins to fall apart. It's not just a slow-burn, it's a boringly slow burn which seems to constantly stall for long periods of time, building (hopefully?) toward something it struggles to deliver. It displays a sort of theatrical sensibility not unlike an Alzheimer's patient trying to tell an engaging story but constantly forgetting what they have and haven't told you. I never thought I'd say this, as a lover of the slow-burn, but this movie could have been a third of its run time and delivered the same impact, maybe better. Someone in the editing room must have fallen asleep during cutting and decided not to screen this, just for kicks, because the result is a bloated run time which really damages the potential of this cool indie horror.Another demerit goes toward the repetitive nature of the scares. There's an over-abundance of ""is something out there?"", ""don't go out there!"" (Just before bad things happen), ""it will be ok"" (when it obviously isn't) and moody shots of the two leads reacting to some terrible sight off screen. I began losing interest after fourth five minutes of wrecked-in-the-rain gave way to a short drive in a new vehicle prior to yet another wrecked-in-the-rain sequence. The material began to feel awfully rehashed by the end, and while I was certain the director had some deep existential point these scenes were meant to convey, it felt like someone held on too tight to the ""I want this left in"" and not tight enough to the ""make sure it serves the story"".And then there's the continuity. The monster inexplicably appears and disappears, following no perceivable pattern. It attacks a wolf, which it mysteriously leaves alive, even though it would have obviously overpowered the smaller animal. It later returns to eat the wolf. Why? Why attack it, leave it alive for a while, go do other things, then come back to partially eat it? But wait, it will happen again. It silently (he never screams) attacks the tow truck driver. Ripping off an arm and tossing it on the hood, then seems to abandon the chase and leave the man alive for a good while, crawling toward his truck. The man doesn't call out for the women he knows could help him. The monster doesn't attack him. The girls don't help him. Then the monster reappears in the road as if he will attack, vanished again, then pulls the man under the truck (the monster would not have fit there). The whole attack sequence was confusing as hell, leaving me wondering how stupid is this monster, really, and what's the point of the attack? It's obviously not hungry enough to be bothered to eat any of what it kills. Sound might attract it, but not most of the time. Sounds occur on several occasion which don't bring the monster. Only the plot-specific sounds, which have no other logical purpose for attracting the monster. And how is it out running (in a forest) an ambulance? Why attack the ambulance then leave again for a long time? The Monster is so ADHD I began to feel like it was senseless to try and decode the behavior-it was all plot contrivance.I was hoping for the climax long before the film wanted me to have it, and I was tired of extended rain shots and weepy mother daughter moments long before the film decided enough was enough. The sad part is that the incessant inclusion of these elements really spoiled the powerful performances lent by the cast, which sold me on the moments, even when the moments were unnecessary and repetitive. The plot served up a big helping of mashed potatoes early on, and they were good mashed potatoes, but then it followed up with mashed potatoes for the entree and for the dessert, and I was left wondering ""is that all you know how to do? Can I get more flavor somewhere in this huge meal?"" Because it was a full length film. There was ample time to do more. It's disappointing that it just kept doing the same thing for an hour after it could have moved on to the next course.This would have made a killer short film, but it bores as a feature length."
" Dont waste ur time
",2020-09-08 00:00:00,2,"Although budget and effects were there, it was cheesy and very predictable. Also non-credible."
" Very good with an undisciplined ending
",2020-09-04 00:00:00,6,"""The Monster"" almost got it right. Almost.For the record, I enjoyed the movie. Also for the record, I was disappointed it failed to sustain itself until the end. It's tense. It's beautifully acted. It's a great ride ... until the last 10 minutes. The ending doesn't totally ruin the movie, but it definitely costs it a couple of stars. The outcome in and of itself isn't the problem; it's how the movie gets there that's deflating.""The Monster"" is an unfortunate illustration of just how important an ending can be, and how a blown one can tarnish the 80 minutes of fine work that precedes it. The filmmakers had something very good in the palm of their collective hand, and they let it slip through their fingers as if they somehow ran out of creative steam a few minutes too early.What makes the undisciplined ending particularly sad is that the movie does so well on so many other fronts. The writers offer a nice metaphor in the mother-daughter battle with both the physical beast and the behemoths of addiction, fear, anger and depression, all ominously present if not always visible. The flawed but sympathetic characters are well drawn and reasonably well developed. The exploration of transgression, redemption, and forgiveness is unexpected and welcome in a genre film of this nature. Even the production values are remarkably good. Nothing about the presentation screams low budget, though it almost certainly was made on a shoestring.Bottom line: You won't be angry at yourself for watching, but you might get a little irked at the filmmakers for not trying just a little bit harder to find a graceful way to get where they needed to go. One wishes they could have a second bite at the apple after a nice rest because every other indication is they can do much better. So yes, watch the movie, but when it comes to the denouement, prepare yourself to be as forgiving as the characters it portrays."
" Ghoulish incredible experience
",2020-08-23 00:00:00,9,"I absolutely love Zoe Kazan in this, her hair and personality is sublime! Bryan Bertino created such an unsettling, dark atmospheric scenery, and well made horror film. I've only seen The Monster once a few years ago and enjoying again with different vibes. One of the best creature features made! Some drama, exceptional amount of horror and fantasy."
" Monsters
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,9,Really impressive Horror flick with a story that mixes a daughters struggle with her mothers alcoholism with being stranded in a broken down car on a deserted road on a rainy night with a monster lurking outside ready to strike.Both the lead performances are great and layered with Ella Ballentine as the daughter and Zoe Kazan as the mother dealing with her own demons and and actual one out for blood.
" A Bit Slow but Ultimately Interesting Movie
",2020-08-22 00:00:00,6,"While the movie is slow at times, it makes up for it with its intense emotions, character building, and action scenes. The film takes you on a journey and you get lost in the struggles of these characters. Don't bother if you hate movies that don't explain everything- it definitely leaves things to the imagination."
" I'm Not Afraid Of You!

" Diamond In The Rough
",2020-08-18 00:00:00,7,"Dysfunctional alcoholic mother Kathy (Zoe Kazan) and daughter Lizzy ( Ella Ballentine) go on a road trip, one that Kathy feels she'll lose Lizzy to once she reaches her father's house.This drive allows Kathy time to reflect on missed opportunities to strengthen her and Lizzy's relationship but chose alcohol and freedom over Lizzy.During this road trip, Kathy and Lizzy run into a bit of car trouble, presenting Kathy the opportunity to prove to Lizzy how much her mother loves you.I wouldn't ideally watch this film, base on the title and movie cover, but this was a Gem and a Half. The cast was perfect, setting also prefect, storyline unbelievable, the acting was a match made in heaven. The only reason I wouldn't give the film a 10 out of 10 is because of the monster chosen in this film and the title. Other than that this film was perfect."
" Seriously a 9, NO WAY!! 4 at best, lame monster film
",2020-08-10 00:00:00,4,"The acting was adequate the story a basic horror movie with a mediocre monster at best. Hardly any gore, a predictable story and of course incredibly stupid victims. Watch only if you're bored and you've watched all the other good horror movies which is getting pretty hard to find!!"
" I gave a 10 because
",2020-07-26 00:00:00,10,I don't know what people expect from a low budget indie film. I thought this movie was very good. That little girl is a great actress. This movie is well worth the watch and the mother daughter dynamic is very similar to so many mother daughter relationships of today. Powerful movie in some respects. Not a ten but i gave it a ten to counter the ones i saw. This movie is a solid 7.
" not up to A24 standards
",2020-07-17 00:00:00,6,"This isn't exactly a bad movie its just kind of the most basic cookie cutter horror movie you could make. I might not be so harsh on it if it weren't an A24 film but I can't help but compare this to hereditary or the killing of a sacred deer and it pales in comparison. the acting is fine but not close to other a24 films, the writing at times felt little over done to me as well. its not at all scary in my opinion not that every horror film has to be but I don't feel like there's much here. idk I would recommend it as its not at all bad but it was a huge let down."
" Cool flic, intense and creepy..
",2020-07-03 00:00:00,4,I felt the mother was the bygger monster. Was at times hard to look.. felt so Sorry for the sweet caring girl....
" Great movie
",2020-06-22 00:00:00,9,"People want to be spoon fed. If you think this is a horror movie only, you weren't paying attention.
Someone said it defied logic ~ of course it did. It wasn't about logic, relationships never are.
This is a love movie masked as a monster movie.
You will jump and might even say predictable, as a monster movie it was. But it was so much more and the actors did an outstanding job showing how deep emotions can run. I typically do not like movies with only a few people because most actors can't pull it off. These two killed it! This was a movie you need to watch with you mind. It's not one you can just shut off and let play. Really good flick, scary too."
" Painful...
",2020-06-07 00:00:00,1,The movie just drags on and the acting and the decisions they make and how everything plays out has you rolling your eyes and wincing the whoooole time....I regret wasting my time watching this...
" Omg I never thought there would be a very cheap movie such as this movie
",2020-05-16 00:00:00,1,Can I know where did you get the costume from? Because my little brother would like it for his next Halloween party this year. Was a man wearing that costume? Because it looks super cheap and the photoshops suck and you guys didn't even spend 40$ on the movie what a waste of time! Guys it's a warning this movie sucks! It's even more worse than cats!!!!! And the costume actually looks like venom you guys didn't even spend money on creating a real character but instead making a cheap looking costume that looks like venom oh one more thing the man that was wearing that cheap costume was he a homeless person that you guys hired because you didn't have enough money to hire a real actor?
" Great fun if you love plot holes
",2020-05-15 00:00:00,2,"*Running over a wolf is apparently sufficient to completely wreck a car and cause severe injuries of the passengers in the car. Given the heavy rain, the limited visibility and the unknown area, the mother should not have been driving too fast anyway, but that may be a topic for another discussion.* The car mechanic arriving at the scene in order to tow the car decides to try and fix it as opposed to simply tow it. He apparently enjoys crawling under the car and lying on a cold, dirty and wet road in the middle of the night.* The mobile phone is put in a bag and the bag goes into the towing car while the mother daughter duo remains in the wrecked car. Good thinking.* The daughter finds the cadaver of the wolf in the woods. The monster appears right behind her but decides that going out of its way to attack her later makes more sense.* The monster manages to grab and drag off the car mechanic from under the car without anyone in the car noticing any of it.* Even having his arm ripped off by the monster does not elicit as much as a single cry of pain from the car mechanic to alert the mother and daughter to the situation. Talk about being discreet.* The monster is not even interested in feeding on its prey. It is only fueled by the need to increase the body count in the movie.* The car mechanic crawls back from out of the woods and attempts to climb to the safety of his towing car. The monster appears on the street, but instead of making a beeline for the car mechanic, it goes around the towing car and pulls the car mechanic under it from the other side. Very efficient.* The monster kills a wolf and a huge car mechanic but pouncing on the mother only leaves her with a gash.* The ambulance arrives at the scene and when one paramedic is flung against the windshield, the other paramedic reacts by kicking out the whole windshield.* The monster takes on a speeding ambulance and topples it rather effortlessly, but a wrecked car stranded in the middle of a road obviously poses an insurmountable problem for it.* The daughter uses a lighter and some inflammable spray to light up the monster with not more than one single burst of flame Quite a feat considering how the monster is dripping wet from the hard rain."
" Wonderful
",2020-04-19 00:00:00,8,"A wonderful fable or fairy tale. A girl's difficult life with her mother turns into a monster. The painful feelings, which run through their relationship, come to a head, when they set out on their parting journey, as the mother takes her to stay with her father, never to return. They care about one another, but the daily stress and the mother's drinking only leads them to bickering and screaming at one another. It's a very sad situation, but one they can't seem to resolve. The mother is sad to let her daughter go, but she is resigned, to the fate of their relationship. On the road, a great mythical creature appears and they must join together to save each other from a fearsome beast. Here the mother has the opportunity to let go of her confusion and fight for the daughter, whom she truly loves. It often takes extraordinary circumstances, for us to move beyond our quotidian cares and issues and act out the deepest commitments of our hearts. Excellent acting, excellent film."
" There's something new at the top of the food chain.
",2020-04-12 00:00:00,7,"This is a taught, well put together suspense-thriller-monster flick. I especially like when a child has a leading roll and can put out a good performance. Ella Ballentine (Lizzy) just about steals the show. The rest of the cast, though small deliver better than average performances for low budget horror, and the setting and direction are also quite good. The movie relies on it's characters to deliver the thrill, vs flashy effects. The monster in question is slightly cheesy, but that can easily be overlooked, again, relying on the setting and characters to create the suspense. He's still scary but it's not overdone. If you're looking for a good monster flick, it's worth a watch."
" Repetitive dialogue
",2020-04-04 00:00:00,3,"The dialogue, specifically the same sentences being repeated line after line, drove me batty."
" Why did the mom let her self die?
",2020-04-03 00:00:00,7,Why didnt the mom just walk with the daughter while holding the torch? The monster wouldnt be able to do anything and they would be fine
" Extremely well made, deep and tense, but low budget monster horror
",2020-04-01 00:00:00,7,"After you watch The Monster you wonder which was the monster .... mother or beast. The filmmakers must surely have realised that calling a movie ""The Monster"" was brave, and given the low budget (four actors) they have at least remained true to the 'mother or beast' sub-text. Which is just as well. Obviously they didn't have the money for a cgi beast. They fall just short of a great monster. Alien (1979) wasn't really cgi either, but they did make a marvellous set of working jaws. In The Monster, the beast doesn't seem to have working jaws. To look at it, all huge teeth, you tend to wonder if such a jaw could actually work in practise, and some really good open and close snaps were what was needed. On the plus side the distinctive growls were reasonably unique and edgy, and helped a lot even if the beast was out of sight. In fact, the overall cinematography was formidable throughout, and the framing was good as well. Great use was made of the rain, the dark and the street lights. There are small problems with details, such as street lights in a particularly remote stretch of forest road, especially since it was clear this was the lesser used 'old road' and not the new one. Also, why was the toe-truck driver so concerned over an oil leak during a storm? Those are two, but there are others. But this is low budget, and lighting is a factor, as is the overall arc of the story. My research has shown that such liberties are often taken with movies. The point that filmmakers fail to appreciate is that we want to turn our brains off when watching a movie, not having to rationalise details to reconcile to ourselves it all makes sense. Luckily the 'mother' side of the 'monster' equation makes far more sense and is brilliantly successful. For once a movie has got the actor age believability correct in that both lead actors look their respective ages, and we don't have to stress over that. And the 'monster mother' story really is a corker, and easily as exciting and interesting as the beast equation. A lot of the stress is brilliantly achieved by worrying that the mother will make decisions that actually make sense and not put her daughter in unnecessary peril. This is a triumph, and because of that I can easily recommend this movie."
" Mediocre with a couple of good scenes
",2020-03-28 00:00:00,5,"The Monster had an interesting start while the premise itself was quite simple.
As it went on it made less and less sense, and the last 10 minutes were...not good.I enjoyed some of the colder flashbacks, I wish they were shot and integrated into the story a little better. The acting was good most of the time, in some scenes it felt like it was missing just that one bit, one emotional emphasis that was lacking.The film is short by today's standards, but it still drags because there is only two locations and two characters.The monster itself was ok for a low budget film, but I wish they still didn't show as much of it as they did in full light.I gave this film a try mostly cause of A24 involvement and because I liked Bryan Bertino's February (The Blackcoat's Daughter). This one didn't work quite well for me, but I hope to see more good films from him and the others involved."
" Who Is The Real Monster Here?
",2020-03-09 00:00:00,3,"Our film focuses on a road trip that goes horribly wrong for a mother and a daughter. While journeying though a stormy night and surrounded by bush land, an accident occurs, leaving the two stranded. But they are not alone. While trying to get back on the road they encounter a monster like creature within the woods- a monster that naturally kills in a gruesome manner.Throughout the film we are given flashbacks and insights into the mother and daughter's relationship with the film deciding to reveal some dark details along the way. The mother is heavily addicted to alcohol and smoking. We also learn that the two don't actually get along and each flashback basically shows the same message/meaning and nothing more. These flashbacks can drag the film on and one flashback I felt goes a little too far....Not only do the film's flashbacks slow the film right down, but there many creative shots and plot elements which also take far longer than what I would normally expect. Don't get me wrong, I love seeing some creative filming within a horror film but here it feels used more to help kill time and to increase the film's total duration. Many predictable moments are had within the film but the audience will have to wait patiently for the film to cut to the chase and confirm what we already know is coming next. This style I speak of comes from Director Bryan Bertino who previously did other horror films such as ""The Strangers"" 2008 & ""Mocking Bird"" 2014.As for performances, I will admittedly say I was impressed with the young actress Ella Ballantine who plays the role of the daughter. As for the monster itself I enjoyed the creativity and look of the creature. While during some moments it appears that someone is in fact dressed up in a suit, I still like the fact the film has made an effort at making a scary monster look real. Also considering the film's budget it's a positive move instead of using CGI.Overall, The Monster is a crafty horror film with an impressive small cast and B Grade filming feels. The film's overall feel is burdened with flashbacks that deliver the same meanings, predictable scenes and not to mention the film's entire duration is a major slow burn. This a horror film that will have an audience but unfortunately this one is not for me. 2.9/10 - Walkden Entertainment"
" What a great monster movie!
",2020-03-03 00:00:00,7,"Actually what a great movie. But the monster is so well made, so scary, and so front-and-center that I'm compelled to keep it at what a ""great monster movie."" This monster is a rarity. It's truly frightening and truly realistic. When it turns and looks at Lizzy we see emotion on its shiny black gorilla-like face. On the heels of that emotion we are drenched in stark fear when those fangs are flourished. Yikes. In this story mommie and daughtie are on the road during a dark and stormy night. Their tire blows out and when the car stops spinning and careening they come to a stop facing a terribly beat up wolf, lying dead on the road in front of them. The mayhem starts now."
" The monster has an exaggerated and weak design
",2020-02-26 00:00:00,5,"Slow, a little melodramatic in introducing details of the life and relationship between mother and daughter that add nothing to the story except the act of redemption by the mother in sacrificing herself, and the daughter in showing that despite everything she likes the mother contrary to what said.The monster has an exaggerated and weak design and anatomically it didn't make sense. Being vaguely like a male gorilla, it had a kind of bat wings, and died with almost nothing.Ok performances."
" Suspense
",2020-02-22 00:00:00,9,Awesome jaw-dropping suspense that keeps you clenching the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie!
" Bad monster movie, fantastic acting
",2020-02-09 00:00:00,5,"This is just another generic monster movie. Sounds effects are used in most scenes to denote the monster's presence, instead of using the monster suit. And to be honest, the suit isn't that great; it's black and almost always mostly obscured, with the only discernable feature being an animatronic mouth with large fangs.Where this movie shines, however, is the acting performances given by Zoe Kazan and Ella Ballentine. Ella is just fantastic as the daughter, and Zoe plays the terrible mother who wasn't ready to have a child perfectly. There are so many scenes where their hated is so real and intense, you honestly feel like they aren't even acting. And yet they also have scenes of love and self-sacrifice for each other, which further accentuates just how good the acting is. The writing and dialogue are on point as well.Honestly, this is a pretty bad monster movie. Cars break down, characters crash vehicles easily, everyone who helps, dies--all of the monster movie tropes are here. The great performances by mother and daughter are what make you watch this movie until the credits roll."
" Good acting and dramatic scenes split into two mediocre plots.
",2020-01-28 00:00:00,5,"It has internal and external character arcs that compete rather than complement each other or bring anything unique. The film's closing statement doesn't fit that character's internal struggle since she's strong-willed from go. The monster shows up late and is uninteresting in design and actions. And the ending requires the mom to act stupidly. Decent in its parts, fails as a whole--but watchable, maybe."
" WHAT A BRAT! (SPOILERS!)
",2020-01-27 00:00:00,8,"Am I the only one who gets angry watching this child allow her mother to die for absolutely no reason at all??!!The mother stepped into the woods to sacrifice herself - to have the monster focus on her so that her daughter could run away to safety. Well, the kid is a horrible listener. Not only does she refuse to take advantage of the moment her mother so selflessly created for her - but she also follows her mother into the woods and attempts to fight the monster off of her mother - and fails miserably, I might add.Had I been that mother, I would've used my last breaths of air to tell my daughter that I should've put her up for adoption. Tisk tisk, little girl. Tisk tisk."
" The acting is above reproach!!!
",2020-01-20 00:00:00,6,The story line may be a bit basic but the acting from both leading females is honestly fantastic.
" I was rooting for the black thing.
",2020-01-13 00:00:00,4,"When the first thing a movie shows you is non-diegetic text then my heart always sinks and it was right to.The problem with this movie is that it has no sense of unity in its narrative. By this I mean there are two discrete sources of conflict that never merge or unify thematically. I know that sounds a bit poncy but I can't think how else to word it. The material conflict comes from the mysterious entity in the dark woods but even before this is even close, we have emotional conflict in the form of this problematic mother-daughter pair and my god it is horrific.Having an interpersonal aspect to your horror movie can be great: it makes us feel for the characters and the whole thing just feels more real. But the excruciatingly soapy interactions between parent and child are just embarrassing in how badly they're written. So much of it could have and should have been left to the imagination; suggested by various visual or verbal cues but instead it beats us over the head with it. The flashbacks do not break up the narrative so much as stall it and this desperate attempt to contrive some story arc of a mother coming into her own in a desperate situation just feels contrived and self-satisfied.With a title like ""The Monster"" you assume it must be going somewhere with it. right? In ""Braid"" we are told right at the beginning that the Princess is kidnapped ""by a horrible monster"" and although I don't want to state spoilers, I think anyone can guess that it is nowhere as simple as the fairytale set up suggests it is. It would be trash otherwise.But there is nothing subversive, ironic, metaphorical or otherwise unexpected in how they handled this. It is just your common or garden monster movie except that rather than terrorizing downtown Tokyo, the beast is only large enough to stalk some wood. That's really it. It's a plot device to set our bad-mother-is-not-so-bad-when-push-comes-to-shove narrative in motion and there is so little pay off.And now for our title character: well, in short, they look great. The whole movie has a superb sense of atmosphere with so many wonderfully composed images in this shadowy road in some forgotten forest on a rainy night. The sensation of lostness and helplessness is palpable and it's really sad it is wasted on this frustrating and hatable movie. There are some wonderful uses of the dark to give us an unclear idea of what we're dealing with but the movie runs out of patience with itself.It's not that what we see isn't well imagined and realized, it's that we see it. This movie like so many just shows too much too soon. Despite a wonderful use of darkness. it's simply too apparent something unusual is up far too quickly so in the end so much potential is lost. I guess they spent so much on ""the monster"" that they thought ""the audience had better see it a lot"". In a better movie I would say that they should give the audience more credit but here I suppose it was the right choice.The irritating script is so painful that it stops this movie from even being sort of OK. Spare yourself from this misguided attempt to add soap opera style characters to what would have been a stylish and effective piece of campfire horror if only they knew to self edit.A better title for this movie would have been ""Mother"". It would be more appropriate for this than that Aronofsky movie. But failing that I guess I would have called it ""Mother and Daughter"" but I guess that isn't great from a marketing angle."
" Seriously??...8/10's?? Dont Believe Them
",2020-01-12 00:00:00,3,"Seroiusly...Anyone who knows remotely ANYTHING about good horror movies could pick the flaws from this one by the dozen. The story just doesnt work. An alcoholic/abusive mother and daughter get stranded in the woods and are being hunted by an evil monster..flashbacks ensue yadda yadda yadda.
The movie tries waaay to hard to make you care about the 2 female protagonists. They nail down clear from the start that their relationship is strained..But the way they handle it throughout the film is just lousey. They almost make you believe the 2 have a deeper connection. At one point it shows the daughter cuddle into her mother on the floor as she succumb to her addiction. Or the mother asking the daughter if she can smoke in the car as a sort of gesture of respect. Only to be slapped with a scene of the daughter holding a knife to her mothers throat saying she hates her. Its just a pacing mess and was totally ineffective for me anyways.
Some reviewers bash the acting in this film but ill give it a pass. I pass the blame to the director and the script. The actresses work with what they have and you can tell there is some talent within them..But its hard to bring out with such poorly written dialogue and directed scenes..Listen... NO ONE who watches horror movies enjoys braindead characters. If a giant monster capable of ripping off limbs is standing 20 meters in front of your vehicle do you:
A) Wail on the horn and scream loudly to warn the half dead guy with no arm
or
B) Turn off your vehicles lights, get down low and don't make a sound
Yeah well this film choose A)...So that tells you a lot,
The filmmakers just further embarass themselves beyond this point. When the teddy bear makes 4 seconds of noise contained within a vehicle..The monster is all of a sudden a super radar and homes in on the cars occupants like a fly on crap. But the horn blowing loud and long accompanied by 2 screaming women didnt peak his interest.
The film does have brief tense moments..When the monster appears on screen the first few times ill admit it gave me hope. The special effects arent terrible and the setting/atmosphere were there..
But sadly so many wrong things that make no sense continue to happen as the film trudges on. The Paramedics show up and become forest detectives instead of getting the wounded to a hospital..Thus getting them killed.
The monster rams an ambulance off the road when it was literally nowhere in sight..
The little girl, who was petrified the entire film, magically becomes immune to fear.. and trounces toward a massive drooling beast who has mauled 4 adult human beings like they were twizzlers. Burning it with aerosol spray and fire triumphantly and oohhh myyyyy god..you see what I mean?? It can never hold its initial tension for anymore then a mere few seconds.
Because of poor writing, lousey directing and an awful script, this movie never stood a chance. The only reason I give it a 3 is because the acting wasnt terrible..As cringy as the scenes were I truly dont blame the actresses. Also I liked the effects and the atmosphere they had going. But in the end this movie certainly isnt worth any horror movie fans time. Give it a pass, youre not missing much."
" Great acting
",2019-11-24 00:00:00,10,The Acting is good. Particularly the alcoholic mother and the daughter having to be an adult. The whole dynamic is just brilliant.
" Not a Monstrously Successful Movie
",2019-11-13 00:00:00,3,"I can't say that this is one movie you'll be talking about for a long time. Maybe it was the directing or a failed script but it just didn't work. The flashbacks with the failed mother didn't help nor did her wasteful sacrifice. The child actress did the best she could but there's only so much one can do with a simple, flawed storyline. At least they strayed away from CGI in their special effects. The symbolism they were trying so hard to achieve just fell flat for me. I wish the producers and directors better luck on their next endeavor."
" Well directed and ineptly written
",2019-11-09 00:00:00,4,"As a kind of cliché'd dumb horror creature monster flick, one doesn't really expect anything on the level of the Godfather or the like, but nonetheless one can be pleasantly surprised by the level of atmospheric direction in The Monster, although most of that is undone by a horribly inept script.The entire movie takes place on the same strip of road for the entire runtime, added with multiple flashbacks which are supposed to give depth to the mother and daughter character. Admittedly, they are flawed people, and do find some sort of redemption towards the end, so the character development (or lack thereof) is not necessarily a weakness. However, these flashback scenes where the mother most times lashes out at the daughter are implemented in the heightened scenes of tension during the ''monster'' scenes, and they flow incongruously, as it only seems to interrupt things. There's even an edit to a flashback right when we see the monster behind the little girl, after which she somehow appears just fine back at their car.Now, atmospherically, the film is quite superb. In the scenes on the road, that is. There's constant rain to display the dreariness of the situation and the lighting and cinematography, despite being unnaturally bright for such a spot, create constant tension. This is also coupled with a lot of shots into the dark forest on the sides, or from the Monster's PoV lurking there in the shadows. It slowly and methodically creates this tension by superb direction, and the monster is shown as little as possible, which i might add, is also created by practical effects, and no CGI whatsoever.Thus, as an atmospheric tension screamer, it succeeds, but unfortunately The Monster is still a dumb monster horror flick. No matter how well technically it is made, we still have these characters constantly making terrible & profoundly stupid decisions & deductions. The wolf they hit in the middle of the road disappears, and the mother immediately dismisses this as nothing. Maybe the wolf got up and left... even though it really was quite dead. Not to mention the gigantic tooth they find in its gutted belly. Now, i understand suspicions aren't on a monster culprit immediately, but she must have at least suspected something far bigger and more dangerous than a wolf was lurking somewhere.There's also the fact that the monster seems to be invisible most of the time, literally snatching some guy from right under the mother & daughter's car, without them noticing it. The monster is too big to fit under it, and the guy was under the front hood, so the monster had to also be to the front of the car to snatch him. Somehow, both the mother & the daughter ( and the audience... )never noticed this. The same could be said for the disappearance of the wolf's corpse. There's just no way they would not have noticed such a hulking monster dragging it away.By far the dumbest moments, however, appear towards the end. An ambulance arrives, and of course despite the mother's significant wound & her alarming distressed voice telling them to leave straight away, the two ambulance personnel linger and get killed. The mother and daughter somehow manage to drive away in the ambulance, but even though the monster was miles behind feasting on one of the personnel, it somehow appears next to the vehicle and dunks it off the road. There, they figure out the monster has a weakness for light, so the mother has the brilliant idea of sacrificing herself by lighting a torch and going into the woods while her daughter makes a run for it. Not only that, but she even douses the fire on purpose when she goes far enough. Nobody here had the idea that maybe both of them should stick together, grab the torch and walk towards the cable guy's truck, which couldn't be far behind. The monster would be powerless against the light. But no, split up, douse the light. If only some of these people had any brains, maybe they would all still be alive. The daughter then winds up her loud toy to lure the monster, and ignites it with a hand made flamethrower, because she knows exactly how to do that. It's also remarkable that the monster didn't go in the crashed ambulance before she threw the toy, but i thought this was due to the light, but it didn't seem to bother the monster by the end when it went for it. So, of course, she survives, and yet all of those other deaths could have easily been avoided.Atmosphere oozes, the direction excellent, but the Monster is generally another dumb horror flick, terribly written & horribly incompetent on most parts."
" Overall pretty pointless

Decent performances from all involved.
Practical FX from start to finish.
Rubbish monster that made no sense in its behaviour or kills."
" Tv broke
",2019-09-23 00:00:00,1,Go see my letter box review about the movie. Just go see if I am adding words so it won't be to short
" A film of two cars, two characters and two halves.
",2019-09-07 00:00:00,5,"When I saw that A24 had a movie called The Monster I was instantly excited. I love their style of film, and I love the directors they work with and their style of storytelling even more. I am yet to come across an A24 movie that I thought was bad, I've disliked some movies they've done, but they're down to personal taste.The Monster truly is a film of two halves; the first being a taught, tense and emotional affair that deals with the effect that alcoholism and an abusive relationship can have on a mother-daughter relationship, all set to a backdrop of them being stalked by an unseen beast hiding in the driving rain. I loved the opening 45/50 minutes and I was really pleased that it didn't follow the usual tropes of these creature features that condemned them to the B List of movie history. The cinematography and the cuts between scenes were phenomenal, telling the characters strained shared past through flashbacks is an amazing way of avoiding a slow paced movie while still establishing characters. I thought the damaged and turbulent relationship between mother and daughter also made a great change to the usual 'carefree couple' or group of BFFs that creature features usually have and both Zoe Kazan and Ella Ballentine were incredible. The slow, steadily increasing tension inside the car was beautifully paced, and watching the two slowly realise something is hiding in the rain was truly exquisite. I really believe this could have been amazing if the film had centred around them in the car and kept the rain as a central force. Unfortunately it doesn't.Act two is more of a generic 'escape/survive' sequence that doesn't follow the emotional rhythms of the beginning and opts instead for a more action based finale. With the first half showing very little of the Monster and leaving the tension to build then release then build again, the second half goes for a more direct approach and tries a more physical, high tempo style of horror. The Monster kills the two paramedics (one offscreen) which makes no sense as a storytelling tool, and one in a fairly tame rip out the window leading to the ambulance crashing and setting the scene for the final showdown between the mother daughter team and the Monster.The finale is where I have the bulk of my issues. I had a few generic horror movie gripes: why didn't they get in the truck as soon as they could, why did the paramedics hang around taking in the sights rather than treating their patient etc but I could overlook them to serve the greater good of the movie. The final 15 minutes is supposed to be the mother's redemption ark, showing how much she truly does love her daughter and that she's willing to sacrifice it all to ensure her escape, unfortunately, the buildup is sloppy and the final 15 feels rushed and without any of the raw emotion that made the first half so good. There isn't any of the slow buildup or creeping dread that first draws you in, meaning that you can telegraph the final 5 minutes, and it almost collapses under the weight of a horror movie cliché ending.The Monster truly is a split movie, and if the second half was like the first it would be an incredible film. Unfortunately the last 40 don't quite stand up with the first 50. While enjoyable, i'd say The Monster is a solid 6/10 with clear room for improvement but by no means is a bad final product. A great casual watch and stands up well after a couple of viewings."
" Boring, stupid and truly awful
",2019-08-29 00:00:00,1,"I chose to watch this movie based on an internet search of 'best horror movies on Netflix'. This showed up around #3 in a top 25 list. However, that list now seems like a croc of ***. I was sooo bored by this movie. It was so slow and not much really happened for the first 45 mins or so. The plot was very weak and at times laughable. The 'scary stuff', when it finally arrived was not very scary and was interspersed with long boring bits where nothing happened or the characters behaved in improbable ways. In summary, 91 mins of my life wasted."
" Monstrous creatures, monstrous parents
",2019-08-07 00:00:00,7,"I was and remain a massive fan of Bryan Bertino's directorial debut, ""The Strangers,"" which I saw in theaters when it was released in 2008. To date it remains one of my favorite films of the 21st century. Given that I am not a fan of creature features, I went into ""The Monster"" with low expectations despite my previous love for Bertino's work, and came out mildly surprised.This is not ordinary monster movie; it's really an allegory on monstrous parents, and the ways that they can (and do) inflict damage on children. The plot follows a troubled, abusive ex-addict mother who winds up stranded on a country road late one night with her precocious daughter; as they wait for help to arrive, a monstrous creature accosts their car.When ""The Monster"" excels, it does so gracefully; it is beautifully shot and lit in a way that makes the singular location quite gorgeous. Shots of the light coming through the trees amidst the pouring rain recall photography of the forests in ""Suspiria,"" and the creature in the film is surprisingly well-crafted with practical effects. Though not necessarily scary, it is menacing and well-conceived. The acting also elevates the material considerably. Zoe Kazan hits all the right notes, portraying the mother in a way that is human and believably flawed; as terrible as she is to her daughter (their tumultuous relationship is dispensed to the audience in flashback vignettes), we, just as her child, retain an affection and sympathy for her. Ella Ballentine plays counterpoint as her mature daughter, who is more of a parent to Kazan's character than Kazan is to her.I think ""The Monster"" will likely resonate with people who have tumultuous and/or co-dependent relationships with their own mothers (or fathers), as that really is the core theme Bertino is meditating on here. Where the film falls somewhat short is in its one-note nature; the setup here is the stuff of standard horror fare, and there are technical inconsistencies that go ignored, but are more or less forgivable given that the film overall has a fairytale feel to it. The plot does at times feel threadbare, but fortunately there is enough tension to keep the audience reeled in. As far as contemporary monster movies go, this is a strong one, and, in this case at least, there is some redemption for at least one of the monsters. 7/10."

",2019-07-26 00:00:00,7,"Watched Bryan Bertino's (e.g., ""The Strangers"") 2016 ""The Monster"" last night -- it's a horror movie that lingers in thought -- not from it's slow-burn tension and graphic horror overlay, but from the ""real"" monsters under your metaphorical bed. The ""monster"" in this lean, visually dark, well-acted ""road trip to Hell"" is an emotionally neglected, adolescent daughter''s conflicting pain / longing; it is personal pain of a failed, too-young mother (who is redeemed in the sacrificial third act), it is guilt/anger from failed struggle with addition (alcohol in this example) -- it is the monster ""you don't see"" in the flesh, but that breathes in life's most testing struggles. The dark, un-penetrated woods from which the creature peers is known to most in some emotional form. The bravery both main characters gradually muster to confront the long-fanged, patient, relentless entity is matched by, and reflects, the bravery to connect as daughter and mother despite past lacerations inflicted upon each other by words and conduct. In facing and slaying their own internal demons, they find a will, through re-discovered love, to heal. But that's just me...."
" Cujo with a daughter
",2019-07-18 00:00:00,3,"Yup, that's almost it in a nutshell. Lizzie is the sweetest little girl you could ever wish to meet, just don't fall asleep if you're her mom! Her mom's a drunk, who's let her down and embarrassed her again and again, yet for some reason she's got custody, Lizzy is the once that takes care of the house and things, yet holds a knife to her mom's throat as she tells her how much she h hates her when she sleeps! The irony is, we pickup on little traits of how the 2 are EXACTLY alike. On the way to her dad's for visitation, they take a break and mom tells Lizzy she's leaving her permanently. From there they decide to drive through the night. Down a country road, which for the life of THIS country girl, I can't figure out why or how there were street lamps, they hit a wolf, incapacitating their vehicle. They call 911, getting them to send a tow truck and ambulance, and well folks, that was the first, last, and only wise decision of the film!Its tough to film in the dark, but they had the lights to play off of, and they just did a sloppy job! The ONLY saving grace of this film was the great CAST! If only they'd read the script FIRST!"
" Sadly..a waste of time
",2019-07-10 00:00:00,2,"I wouldn't recommend watching this film. The concept was interesting, but the execution was bad, perhaps it was due to the script...or that the pacing was off. The characters also made a lot of choices that didn't make any sense. What a shame :("
" Pathetic
",2019-07-01 00:00:00,2,One of the dumbest movies I ever watched. Please don't waste your time or money in it. It took boredom to a next level. That much slow paced and stupid movie.
" Genuinely Spooky
",2019-06-30 00:00:00,7,"Definitely had me riveted to my seat. An alcoholic woman is raising an adolescent daughter, and has to drive her to her Dad's place which is somewhere out in the boonies. The daughter is as messed up as her mom. She still drags her teddy bear around and she is scared of her own shadow. She loves her mother. She hates her mother. She is very confused. She is as much the parent as her mother is. The mother gets sober, relapses, gets sober. There are a lot of flashbacks to their relationship as the story progresses.And then, there is the monster. I kept thinking that it could have just been a big nasty grizzly bear, but the director/writer wanted to conjure up something out of our childhood nightmares. The tension and suspense is palpable. It revolves around what we don't see. What's in the closet or hiding under the bed. The wolf that gets in the middle of the road and almost begs to be killed.It's not a masterpiece, but its good. You feel for the characters. You care about them. You sense what they are going through. And there is a point to it. A theme about redemption through adversity."
" More than a monster
",2019-06-21 00:00:00,6,"The plot of this movie is as follows: Mom and daughter get stranded on the road, and then are attacked by a literal monster. Standard jump-scare fare, right? Wrong. It seems weird to say, but if you just want to watch a monster movie in the vein of Lake Placid, The Monster would be a comically poor choice. It's an intensely emotional family drama with the trappings of horror, not a horror movie with a dramatic subplot.So yes, there is a wrecked car, a rainy night, and a literal monster, but that's just an excuse to put the characters in a pressure cooker of stress. The Monster is mostly about the mom's terrible relationship with her daughter and how their desperate situation pushes all the toxicity- along with the underlying bond- to the surface. The result is more than a little bit depressing and hard to watch, and I can see people being put off if they're only there for the gore and the jump-scares. I also have some questions about the decisions the characters make- questions that undermine the whole plot if you're taking it literally instead of as an external expression of inner dysfunction.That said, there's something truly worthwhile going on here if you're up for it. I can't say I *enjoyed* The Monster, because that's the wrong word for such a sad and uncomfortable watch. Here's what I can say: this movie sacrifices its very horror-ness to take a big swing at your emotions, and for me, it makes solid contact. Not a home run, but a line drive double that's going to be rattling around in my soul's outfield corner for a while. If you're open to feeling feelings, it might do the same for you."
" A decent atmospheric horror movie.
",2019-06-17 00:00:00,5,"The Monster is a horror film that narrates the events that happen to a mother and daughter when they suffer a road accident in a forest, while they are stalked by a strange bloody creature, a monster.A movie that I can't really denote too many outstanding features of. It's just a simple horror movie about monsters, simple, fun to kill time, environmental and with excellent practical effects, but after that, there's not much more to say. The story tries to maintain an emotional structure representing multiple flashbacks on the history of the protagonists, however it reaches a point where it feels that it is overexposure and too forced for the story; it causes the advance to feel slow, retarded, like a slow burn.However, the movie is entertaining, has good performances, a dark atmosphere and excellent practical effects, something that every year is becoming less popular, the glorious use of practical effects, which let me tell you, when used in a professional way, causes fabulous effects.In conclusion, the movie is a great ''meh'', does not have too many fantastic things or bad things, is entertaining, decent, somewhat slow, but does not last too long, the performances are good, make us feel bad for the characters, but is ruined by the terrible decisions they make, but well, that is something to expect in this genre. Even so, it was fun, something nice to spend the night with."
" A simple plot marred in subtext.
",2019-06-15 00:00:00,5,"Brian Betinos 2008 flick 'The Strangers' was as simple as a film can get, and was well seasoned with some simple character backstory that added to the sense of tragedy and added to the tension of the film. In this film the heavy handed addiction sublot diffuses the tension of the film, and makes it difficult to empathise with the relationship at the core of the film. Its well shot, well acted but I felt myself getting detached from the action early on."
" Tedious and poorly done
",2019-06-14 00:00:00,3,"Wow, this movie was terrible.I know it was most likely trying to be symbolic, but the awful dialogue and bad acting were too distracting to even care. The whole script is pretty bad, but the dialogue is so unnatural at times and while the actors try their hardest, that may be the problem, too. Maybe it's bad editing, but it seemed like everyone was overacting. There is one death scene that is a solid minute too long and it becomes eye roll-worthy and almost laughable. The young girl gives her all but it became really irritating, really quickly.The monster itself was quite underwhelming, although I give credit to the filmmakers for not using CGI. Unfortunately the monster's face is so wooden and incapable of movement that it wasn't very frightening, and I couldn't stop thinking about how it was just a guy in a costume.Lastly, the decisions made by some of the characters were too illogical and the ending was a bit dumb. Skip this one!"
" Cliched, stupid, disappointing
",2019-05-31 00:00:00,3,"The premise was promising but the delivery was so disappointing. The flashbacks could have been taken out and you wouldn't miss anything. The opening scene of the mother being selfish and lacking responsibility was enough to tell us how strained the relationship between mother and daughter would be. Once we're in the forest cue all stupidity and overplayed drawn out tension. When given the opportunity to get in the truck they decide to stay in the car, even though the guy puts all their things in the truck? The girl is frightened yet decides to walk into the woods and examine a half chewed up wolf? The tow truck driver has to spend ages underneath the car instead of just hitching it up? We know immediately that he's just cannon fodder, as we also do when the ambulance turns up. And why does the monster ignore the girl when she is examining the wolf? None of it made any sense?
The performances were good but the story was poor."
" Waaaay better than the 5.4 it currently has.
",2019-05-19 00:00:00,7,"What a shame that this movie is rated a 5.4 currently. Is it a perfect movie? It isn't but it's above average for sure.Here's what works really well in this movie - the relationship. All good scenes, movies, novels etc need good relationships. Without them it falls flat. In The Monster you can really feel the relationship between the mom and daughter. You feel how strained it is due to the moms persona problems and how it forces the daughter to emotionally age faster. We are shown multiple scenes where the daughter is essentially the adult and the mom is the one needing taken care of. Yet at the same time, underneath that we are shown that there is a deep love between them as well despite how strained the mother/daughter relationship is. Well done.The acting is another thing that is really performed well. Both of the main characters, the mother and the daughter, do a great job acting in this film. We believe the characters due to the actors seamless performance of their roles. The actor of the daughter in particular did an excellent job. Hopefully they both go on to do more good things in the future.I think the dialogue is also very strong in this film. There was maybe one time during the whole movie where a character said something I didn't think the character did. And in retrospect I may change my mind on that.Any flaws I see in this movie are minor at best. It's definitely a strong movie worth watching."
" Loved it in every way
",2019-05-15 00:00:00,8,"Personally I loved this horror movie, it was sooooo much better than it had any right to be!If you describe this movie everything sounds like a cheap basic horror flick. All filmed in a house or a deserted stretch of road where you probably didnt need any film permits. Only a half dozen or so actors and no extras. A monster who remains in the dark almost all the time. All sounds like its about saving money rather than a good movie.The thing is though every actor did a really great job, including the child, in fact especially the child. The monster was perfect for the movie and actually really creepy. The script was tight and on point and the music was subtle but created a really suspenseful atmosphere.I put this in expecting a cheap basic creature feature, this isnt that at all, its a seriously good movie in my opinion."
" 5.4 IMDb Stars - Way To Low - This is A Creepy, Really Intense Horror/Monster Movie - Loved It
",2019-05-11 00:00:00,9,"05/10/2019 The two principle actresses Zoe Kazan (mother) and Ella Ballentine (daughter) did a superb job in this creepy, scary monster movie. All the elements necessary for a creep fest are present, dark, foreboding, rainy late night accident on deserted back road that disables car (have to stay with the car) and lucky for us Mr. Monster is laying in wait. This is a perfect scare film, well thought out and executed by all involved. I loved it. Bon Appetit"
" Over the top drama and really over acting
",2019-05-05 00:00:00,2,"The monster is annoying and frustrating and slow. The actress is very young to be a mother and I don't think plays the role well. the daughter is annoying throughout the movie appears (acts) so much mature for her age. Her voice is so annoying.Acting altogether is bad and unconvincing. The drama is almost rammed down our throats at every scene.. Literally sometimes repeating even phrases over and over. Hammering on about their relationship. I didn't even feel any sympathy for any of them.
This is NOT a horror but drama.
Honestly it's a background movie when you doing other things. But personally I would waste my time.I feel really wanted this movie to end."
" Well-acted, nice cinematography and great atmosphere
",2019-05-01 00:00:00,8,"At times the movie does seem to drift between genres but it's basically a good monster movie. The dysfunctional family scenes can be stressful but they are clearly designed to set a scene of great distress in the aftermath of a broken family and alcoholism. This dysfunction is what was the cause of the mother and daughter car trip getting off to a bad start, leaving late afternoon virtually assures late-night travel. The monster itself was slow to be revealed, adding to the tension. The slow build-up might be too long for those who don't enjoy a more old-fashioned thriller with some actual back-story and character development. The ending was typical bad-planning-in-a-crisis, miscommunication and the needless sacrifice of the mother, who could have done what the daughter did. Perhaps this could be interpreted as her guilt, sentencing herself for the abandonment of her child and ultimately for putting her in this situation. Monster effects are okay, it has its scary moments but it's not high-tech. The moments of scare are the dark forest, hearing it and then seeing it stand up, creeping in the shadows. Altogether an enjoyable monster movie."
" Seems like an allegory for the opiate epidemic currently seizing the United States.
",2019-04-16 00:00:00,8,"For those of you who didn't pick up on it, remember the scene when the little girl's mom and her boyfriend grill her about something they are missing and then her mom smacks her across the head after the boyfriend grabs what appears to be pills from something sitting right next to the little girl? Has anyone else ever heard of an addiction referred to as a monster? Doesn't it strike anyone else as a little odd that n the plot of this ""monster movie"" is incredibly simplistic and that before killing him the monster takes a mans arm (which is where a person typically injects heroin). Not to mention that the monster kills ever adult it goes after. The only one who survives is the little girl, who is someone who we see cleaning up her mother's beer bottles and trying to get her mother up out of bed near the beginning of the movie. I really enjoyed this movie because it made me think more than most do."
" Ok until it defied all logic
",2019-04-13 00:00:00,5,"The movie seemed like it was going to be far better than a couple horror stinkers I watched recently, but then it wasn't. It did a nice job of building suspense, with a few startles that made me jump, but ultimately, it made little sense in the end. It was established early-on that the mother was scum and her relationship with her daughter strained, so I'm not sure why we keep seeing flashbacks to just how insufficient her mothering was, though these flashbacks weren't boring at least. But the things that really made little sense to me and ruined the film were as follows:Several people just disappeared without so much as a scream. One would think that being dragged away in the darkness would be cause for at least a mild cry of 'help.'More significantly, it is established that the 'monster' is afraid of light, so the grand plan the mother comes up with is to light a torch, then put it out and let the monster get her while her daughter escapes in the darkness. Here's an idea - light the torch and carry it while you both escape together - or more simply, escape with a flashlight (which also seemed to be enough to deter the monster).And finally, this has to be the most flammable creature that's ever lived, done in by a cigarette lighter and some aerosol spray (that somehow the daughter knows to use to create a flamethrower)."
" Very Impressed.
",2019-04-08 00:00:00,9,"The film has an emotional, smart and well thought out story line. It is tense and scary throughout with good practical effects. Not much fault with this film. Thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend."
" It was pretty good for another Montser film!
",2019-04-01 00:00:00,8,"I enjoyed this movie and was able to get into it. I love that it's not just another person stranded movie, and through the whole movie. They are just trying to find ways to escape. This movie actually flowed quite well and went in a nice pace. I also love how they put this young mother/daughter relationship, at times even made me tear up. The mother is young and alcoholic, the daughter is mature, always taking care of everything and ready to go to her fathers house. The daughter tries to love and help her mother through her addiction but ends up hating her at times, she even hates the alcoholic boyfriend. Then the daughter packs them up to go live with her father, the mother knows she won't come back. They get in the car, with a late start and drive to the fathers house. That's when something makes them get into a minor car accident. From there the daughter calls the police and the dad, so they just wait till help comes. They also think they only hit a wolf but then the wold disappears, they find a huge tooth. One persons after another who comes to help them gets eaten by this monster, the ambulance finally comes. They all end up dead, even though the mother was trying to warn them all. So she takes the ambulance and tries to get off this abandon road, where the monster lives and eats people, animals, whatever. But the monster hates light. Anyways they get into another accident with ambulance truck because the monster stops them again! As all this stuff is going on they have flashbacks about the mother and daughters relationship. It's really say and heart full. Especially how the mother knows she's a screw up and is trying to better but can't. The daughter goes through a lot also. But the mother really loves her daughter. She just doesn't know how to be a good mother. When they get stuck in the ambulance, the mother is in bad shape, coughing and throwing up blood. So she tries to sacrifice herself, so the daughter can run away and get help. The daughter doesn't run and goes back for the mother, but the mother has already been half eaten by the monster. The daughter is extremely sad, and goes back to the ambulance to make her own plan. Her plan works and she kills the monster, and no longer afraid of monsters. At the end with the last flashback of the mother/daughter had me tear up. As it's not just a monster escape movie, it's also a relationship we get to see between mother and daughter. It caught my attention and I felt it was really good!"
" Very tense, pretty enjoyable.
",2019-03-28 00:00:00,6,"The Monster does exactly what the title suggests, delivers you just that, a Monster, we know nothing about it, just that it loves to kill, doesn't like lights, and is a cousin of Venom.I'd you're expecting a story, forget it, as there isn't one, apart from the dynamic between daughter and useless mother, who obviously comes good in the end.It has plenty of atmosphere, lots of tension, and some moments I really rather enjoyed, what it lacked was any real depth, who cares, it was just a good old fashioned monster story. I'd recommend, 6/10."
" Plain Terrible
",2019-03-22 00:00:00,1,"Are you kidding me? Who's rating this trash above 5 stars ? This movie was awful. The dialogue made no sense, the acting was terrible and made no sense, and don't get me started on the absolutely idiotic decisions. For instance:1.the mother saw the tow truck driver's arm land on the car yet she continues to stand outside looking around instead of getting back in the car2.she tells her daughter to get out to go get their phones in the middle of the storm and this little idiot goes off into the woods to stare at the dead wolf yelling for her mom to come look as if her mom would actually hear her3. Why in the world were the EMTs out investigating ? Shouldn't they, oh I don't know, be tending to the critically injured patient in the ambulace and be more focused on getting her to a hospital?I hated both of the characters , this is one of those movies where I was rooting for the monster to just eat them all. The mom, the daughter, the Ends, all annoying idiots . I got the analogy but, having a clever analogy isn't all it takes to make a movie good.The absolute stupidity and brain dead high reviews inspired me to create an account as I just could not contain myself !Don't watch this movie unless you want to experience the frustration I and others felt ."
" Amazing Film! Worth the Watch?

" Terrible.
",2019-03-19 00:00:00,2,Don't know how I watched this to the end. It is truly awful in every aspect. I gave it 2 stars as it was ok for the first 10 minutes or so!
" All the negative reviews are true
",2019-03-19 00:00:00,2,"I wasted a perfectly good night for this. It started off promising, but got progressively more and more nonsensical. Yes, I understood the analogy; but that doesn't excuse the flat-out bad script. I wanted to scream at the characters for being so dumb and making stupid mistakes that made absolutely no sense.Extra star only because the monster looked kinda cool."
" One lime
",2019-03-07 00:00:00,3,"I don't like giving a film such a low score because I know first hand the effort and skill it takes to make a film, but when I was an hour into this film I felt like I was coming to the end of a lord of the rings marathon. Such a short film shouldn't be a slog."
" Effective but there's a bit missing..
",2019-03-06 00:00:00,7,"A good psychological horrer mashup but, it missed the opportunity to tie the story up to the myth of the Jersey Devil. I'm sure this was the origin of this storyline."
" Not bad, not great

" 7/10
",2019-02-23 00:00:00,7,Overall I enjoyed the film. Thought the monster was pretty effective and enjoyed the storyline but WOW the young girl was actually insufferable. At many points in the film I almost gave up because she just kept on whining.
" Enjoyable creature feature.

" Whine whine whine
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,3,"A girl and her mother are trapped in a broken down car while a monster is on the rampage.This could have been a good film as both the actresses were good. However, it's really let down by:Unnecessary flashbacks.The constant whining.Unrealistic reactions to situations.Unrealistic actions by the monster.and worst of all they reveal the monster. Not only is the monster revealed but it's revealed early on in the film. Did nobody who made this movie watch Alien? If you feel you have to reveal a monster at all then leave it right until the end.But I'd have preferred if they'd just left the monster out of it all together. The imagination is far more powerful than what you can show on a screen.Lastly, this was supposed to be some back road through woods and yet there are street lights."
" I'd have escaped
",2019-02-16 00:00:00,2,They had plenty of chances to escape ... bad parenting.
" Decent enough little horror
",2019-02-15 00:00:00,6,"'The Monster' is a pretty simple little film - a mother (and that term describes the woman in the loosest possible terms, as she can hardly be called 'doting!') takes her daughter for a late night drive across country, only for their car to break down and become victim to a - largely unseen - monster.Having only the two primary characters does mean that you get a decent amount of time (approximately half the film) to get to know the pair of them before the beastie really starts trying to do its worst. As I eluded to, the mother is pretty much a waste of space at the beginning of the film when we first meet her, so there's plenty of room for her character to grow, so to speak. Plus the little girl who plays her daughter is certainly a talented young actress who isn't in any way as annoying as about 90% of kids who appear in films these days!It really is as much of a character piece as it is about the creature. Yes, the nasty ol' monster does show up during the second half of the film and it is pretty decent when it comes to special effects. The film is hardly 'high budget' and they money must have been used for the creature, as it does look quite different to most recognisable on-screen beasties.The human stars also behave in - I guess you'd call in - a 'sane' way. By that I mean that you (hopefully!) won't be screaming too much at the on-screen characters due to them making all those ludicrously-bad decisions that people always seem to make in horror movies.However, despite the lack of characters being a plus in that we can really get to know them, it is also a kind of drawback as we - the audience - know that neither of them are going to bite the bullet (or just disappear down the monster's throat) anywhere through the movie (and you'll have to wait until the end to see if they do make it out of this situation).It's a tense little horror movie that does its best with a limited budget to build characters and not reveal too much of the creature until it ultimately has to. It's possibly a little 'over-long' and could have done with having a few of the more 'filler' scenes left on the cutting room floor, but, overall, anyone who's interested in horror shouldn't feel like they've wasted their time sitting down to this."
" Ignore the bad reviews they didn't get the analogy!
",2019-02-13 00:00:00,9,People here was watching it thinking the film was about actual monsters not realising it was all a reference to a mother and daughter fighting addiction...
" Terrible and pointless

" Poor at best
",2019-02-11 00:00:00,1,"Excessive flashbacks, too much screaming...the point was received very early on that their relationship was heavily strained (even BEFORE the actual ""monster"" encounter) and a monster that literally looked like a man in a black trash bag...The total lack of respect for both leads was way over the top.SPOILERS:Additionally, please explain how the youngest of the protagonists gets the better of the monster, when several adults lack ANY capacity; and they just seem to passively allow the ""monster"" to maul, rob, and destroy? How does such a huge, clearly other-worldly creature get dispatched by about 2 minutes of fire and exactly 13 stick floggings, 2 of which were half-hearted?"
" Avoid
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,2,Watched this on Netflix one of the worst films ever made I could have done better with the practical effects myself was clearly a man in a rubber suit
" The Monster: A monster let down
",2019-02-09 00:00:00,3,"I remember three years ago watching the trailer for this and being a little excited. It looked like an interesting creature feature, something we just don't have enough of these days.Telling the story of a mother and daughter who are involved in a car crash in the middle of nowhere. When helps comes they learn that there is something sinister stalking them from the darkness.Okay, solid concept what did they do with it? Not much actually, in fact arguably the threat from the beastie isn't even the primary theme of the film. Mother and daughter have issues, they don't get along due to the mothers poor life choices and the constant flashbacks dominate the film.I wanted a creature feature not a Lifetime melodrama! Sadly alike said melodramas we have serious character issues, the daughter is frustratingly annoying and the mother is so detestable that all efforts of redemption were lost on me.So half the movie isn't even the creature feature, our two characters are really unlikable and the film actually manages to be rather boring despite having a big flesh eating monster in it.Speaking of the monster that is one thing I appreciated, it reminded me of the generic beasties we commonly got in the 80's. I liked this, it was old school and very welcome.The Monster is not a creature feature and you'll likely be disappointed if that's what you're seeking. It's a mix of that and a very drab melodrama with characters you'll actually want to see get ripped apart by the monster.The Good:Old school beastieDecent settingThe Bad:One protagonist is awful, the other is just plain annoyingMore melodrama than creature featureManages to do most things poorly"
" a child shall lead them
",2019-02-07 00:00:00,5,"I understand that ""The Monster"" is about overcoming one's fears and trying to become a better person. Maybe so. It succeeds to some extent in that regard. As a horror movie it's pretty routine. The monster itself looks like a panther from the front and a painted-black eagle from the side.Worth seeing, if only once."
" Nice monster, shame about the film
",2019-02-06 00:00:00,3,"THE MONSTER is a follow-up movie from the guy who directed and wrote THE STRANGERS and like that film it suffers from very poor and undistinguished writing. The direction is better, but still nothing special, and the budget is very low here. Small scale films such as this need lots of suspense and incident to keep them interesting; the similarly-plotted SPLINTER is an all time favourite of mine, which shows it can be done.THE MONSTER, on the other hand, is entirely weak. Both mother and daughter characters are unsympathetic and their dialogue is pathetic; the early scene with the repeated swearing is an absolute joke. What this film does boast is an excellent and very creeply-looking monster, one of the best I've seen in a low budget movie. It's just a shame there's not a proper film to feature it in."
" Great drama with monster as crisis
",2019-02-04 00:00:00,8,"Excellent acting and directing. The setting really does feel magical and scary. But, the monster part is just a catharsis where the main characters resolve their Heroic arc. The young girl was played by Ella Ballentine, a superb actress. I loved the movie."
" Strong game that fumbles at the goal line.
",2019-01-29 00:00:00,7,"First, I hate sports metaphors. I'll punch myself in the face for that title. I'm sorry.As many have said, decisions and events in the final act are dubious and implausible, and that's a shame because otherwise this was a fine film. The dynamic between the mother and daughter, the flashbacks of their dysfunctional relationship, were painful in their realism and painstaking in their portrayal. I notice that the two lead actresses were nominated for several awards, and deservedly so.Working in the healthcare field in a very public facing capacity, I have seen reversed relationships like the one depicted here too many times. A young child should not have to bear the burden of a parent who for whatever reason refuses to be an adult. Not only does it rob the child of a childhood, it leaves them broken before they ever reach adulthood, often causing the cycle to repeat itself.At the same time, and as the film so effectively demonstrates, the parent does indeed love the child. She just doesn't have the skills, maturity, mental stability, and/or sobriety to convey that love in a healthy way. It's tragic no matter how you look at it.And if you're thinking,""Wow, nerd, this is a weird digression for a horror movie review,"" then you can maybe see that this film is special in spite of its missteps during its final act.This could have been a cookie cutter horror film that stumbles towards the end. It still stumbles, but the previous two-thirds make up for it. It's not a film that I'll forget anytime soon."
" Enough with the fake reviews! The only monster is this movie.
",2019-01-26 00:00:00,3,"It's funny how all the good reviews were posted even before the movie came out. Anyway. It you want a daughter and mother screaming 'f#$$ you"" or crying for 1.5 hours this is the movie for you. Not a good indie movie at all. A drama covered in the guise of horror and with subject matter has been done before and better and the end was absolutely horrible. The practical effects weren't bad for low budget though"
" Fake reveiws giving it anymore then a 3 is wrong

" Stupid and boring attempt of a creature movie
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,2,"Terrible characters with a pointless backstory, nonsensical decisions etc. After waiting an hour for anything to happen, youre already beyond bored and waiting for the end. 2 stars because of the practical effects but other than that this is a pointless boring movie."
" I wanted to like it...
",2019-01-21 00:00:00,3,"The Monster is a movie that had a lot of potential.. But then again, a lot of movies have potential. The film follows an alcoholic young mother and her 8 year old daughter (the actress is about 13) and how they get into a car accident and are hunted by a standard issue movie monster (part predator, part werewolf, part creature from Feast..) The movie had one good moment: when the mom passed out in the bathroom and the daughter falls asleep next to her. The rest of the film is complete trash. The acting is horrible, the characters are very unlikable, the so-called metaphor makes no sense, the scares aren't scary, there's no suspense, and the writing is terrible. The only highlights of this film are the cinematography and the score. The idea could've been amazing but there's nothing we can do about it now."
" Monster brings big hype, missed the mark tho..
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,3,"Monster seems more like a family drama, expressing the consequences of alcoholism and failed parenting. Monster was seen seldomly, although it did look decent it wasnt much more than that. The movie was very slow yet I couldn't stop it due to me wanting to see the monster in which it took its time."
" Title was the only thing that shone out.
",2019-01-18 00:00:00,3,"Basically a family drama, explaining the hard ends of family and alcohol abuse and
A neglected kid. Monster was seen at seldom. Very slow and time consuming was not as expected just another C+ horror movie ."
" Two ""Monsters"" in ""The Monster""
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,7,"The film is reminiscent of Val Lewton's productions of horror films at RKO Studios from 1942-1946. Lewton concentrated ""on ominous suggestion and themes of existential ambivalence"", according to Wikipedia, rather than out-and-out horror.The real ""horror"" in ""The Monster"" is the relationship of the alcoholic mother and her daughter. Flashback scenes of the two provide most of the real horror in ""The Monster."" In fact, the mother could be the monster in ""The Monster."" With so many reviews of this film, the plot is probably already known. And, as many reviewers have noted, the plot is familiar. However the acting and overall competence of the filmmakers is very much above average in comparison to other ""B or Indie""-movies of this type. The low rating is surprising."
" Meh
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,5,"What's worse then a really bad movie? A mediocre one. And that's exactly what this movie is; just meh.The dialogue and acting is very shallow and simple. The movie drags at times with some scenes being longer then they need to be. Sometimes logic is just tossed out the window. The creature is clearly meant to be deep and symbolic, but instead it just comes off as very cheesy and lame.You can tell what the writer and director were trying to do with the story and themes. Unfortunately, it just didn't come together for them."
" Drama Horror
",2019-01-14 00:00:00,2,Im sorry but these 2 just dont mix for this horror fan. Horror movies have elements of sadness in then all ready. But when movie makers try to force the sadness then its insisting upon itself thus removing the elements of horrir and making it a nightmarish drama. And then the lack of survival skills. Yes im getting the meaning behind it but still. If certain events took place with out the drama being thrown around it would have made it more of a noble cause. Now its just a case of the give ups.
" This is a good movie...if it was supposed to be a cautionary tale about bad parenting
",2019-01-13 00:00:00,1,"I'm sure the director didn't intend for this to be a PSA for why a lot of people shouldn't breed but that's all I took away from it.I don't get the appeal of Zoe Kazan. She is not attractive and I don't like her acting. She was terrible in this. Good acting is when you don't think the actor is acting. They are so good they make you feel as if that is how they are IRL. You could tell she was trying to act like what she thought an alcoholic would act like and you could also tell she felt pretty smug about her performance. Well there's a reason no one has ever heard of this movie until it came to Netflix.The little girl wasn't bad but was reduced to crying and acting hysterical.WTH is Scott Speedman doing in this?! I'm guessing he owed a favor to the director or he was visiting someone on the set one day and they said ""Hey how bout we throw you in for 10 seconds?""The story was slow and boring. The mother was horrible so therefore I felt nothing towards her and was glad when she was killed. The flashbacks did nothing other than make the director feel like he was being poignant.Also the monster is put off by light yet comes right into the bright lit up ambulance with no issues? Plus spends way longer than necessary ripping apart that stuffed dog just so the little girl could get away. Right.The mother who looks to be about 90 lbs soaking wet (literally cause she's soaked by the rain) is able to fight off a monster so strong it was able to ram the ambulance off the road. Ok sure.Also the monster doesn't hesitate with anyone else and kills them instantly ripping body parts off yet it attacks the mother and she gets away with only a few scratches the first time and the second time even though she dies she still has all her limbs intact. Same with the little girl - it hesitates long enough for her to get her ""I'm not afraid of you speech"" in before it charges and she just so happens to be able to get the lighter lit on the first try despite her being hysterical moments earlier.What's up with the mom being completely bloodied and hysterical after they get her in the ambulance after the attack yet she's able to pull herself together enough to take out her IV and take charge of the situation when the monster attacks again?If an ambulance or tow truck just never shows up after a call no doubt someone would be sent to check on them yet it's morning when the little girl is headed out to walk to safety and still no sign of anyone.Why was the EMT looking into the woods forever?! You're an EMT not the police! You have the person in the ambulance-tend to the victim and get moving to the hospital! Why did she all of a sudden turn into some type of investigator combing the woods? So stupid.The dialogue was reduced to ""I hate you!"" ""I need you to be brave."" ""Shhh don't make any noise."" ""Mama."" and that's about it.I don't need to warn you away from this as the title kind of says it all. They couldn't even come up with an original or unique title therefore you will see nothing original or unique about this."
" Surprised
",2019-01-12 00:00:00,5,Not bad at all. Well written and acted. Enough emotional depth and backstory. Well worth a viewing.
" Left Me Flat
",2019-01-10 00:00:00,6,"I was hoping the monster was a metaphor, perhaps of the massive car accident up on the highway, and the creature was the full manifestation of the fears of the little girl. I was wrong, and so the film ends like any other B-flick monster movie--the thing is killed, fade to black. The acting was good and realistic. But I need metaphor; symbolism; anagogic storytelling. I don't need another weekday afternoon Japanese monster film. Seen too many of them when I was a kid."
" Interesting family issue with a monster.
",2019-01-09 00:00:00,7,"The story between the mother and the daughter is really good, sorta surprising actually, both of them do a nice job. Although there are some scary moments, when the monster shows up the movie goes down hill. The ending was a little disappointing especially because my expectations went high due to the mother\daughter story that surprised me, thus I was expecting them to keep up that good story to the end."
" Not horrible
",2019-01-07 00:00:00,6,"This film is not horrible. Zoe Kazan and Ellie Ballantine are both talented actresses. Like the Babadock, the movie uses a creature as a metaphor for a human condition - in this case, alcoholism and the fear of it. The monster scenes are interspersed with flashbacks between the volatile relationship between mother and daughter, characterized by screaming, hiding, hating, loving, and helping. The film may not please everyone - less so hardcore horror fans I believe. But those who can relate to single parenthood, addiction, the challenges between mother and daughter, may find it poignant."
" Excellent monster movie
",2018-12-17 00:00:00,9,A disfunctional family drama with a sprinkle of monster. Very good.
" ""Where'd The Wolf Go?!""...
",2018-12-04 00:00:00,8,"THE MONSTER starts off with Kathy (Zoe Kazan) and her young daughter, Lizzy (Ella Ballentine) getting ready for a trip. This is complicated by Kathy's alcoholic / drug addicted life, making Lizzy far more responsible than most kids her age. Actually, Lizzy is far more mature than her mother. Their relationship appears to be broken beyond repair.Kathy is taking Lizzy to her father's house for a while. Perhaps, for good. Along the way, as night falls, an accident occurs, and they're stranded in a disabled car in the middle of nowhere. As the title implies, things are about to get a whole lot worse! This will certainly be the longest night of Kathy and Lizzy's lives. That is, if they survive it.This is a horror / monster movie, set against a backdrop of severe family dysfunction, ultimate sacrifice, and redemption. Great non-CGI creature effects and a solid story make this a worthwhile, low-budget film. Both principal actors were adept at pulling off the mother / daughter dynamic in the midst of sheer terror. Believability in a movie of this sort is a big plus!The monster itself is quite imposing, like a huge shadow in a nightmare. A shadow with claws and long teeth..."
" If you go down to the woods.....
",2018-09-23 00:00:00,7,"The Monster taps into the primal fear all people have. A dark fear that spawned devils, demons, ghosts and other varieties of monstrous things. There's some merit to the simple story this film sets up. A not so serious car accident that leaves a down and out mother and her long suffering daughter, alone on an isolated woodlands road. A road that's a thin line of civilisation that cuts through a forest inhabited by something wholly uncivilised and savage. Cinematic's really define this film, as might be expected. They are well done and carry the film forward nicely. The dark, rain swept setting and the subtle use of camerawork to tease out the inevitable confrontation is polished and well paced. What for me, did not work so well, is the constant flash backs to the sad life the two key characters shared. Its established early on that the mother character is dysfunctional and little more than a child herself. Something emphasised by the role reversal that see's the daughter adopting the mothering role. I personally saw no merit in repeatedly underlining this point. The other flaw in injecting flash backs is it tends to diffuse the tension which is nicely established as the story unfolds. That said, there is still more to like here than not. The Monster is genuinely creepy and terrifying, helped in no small part by convincing performances by both female leads. Certainly one of the better horror films made with a modest budget. 7/10 from me."
" An Allegory in Horror Format
",2018-09-17 00:00:00,7,"The metaphor here might be a bit too direct for some, but I really enjoyed it. As a superficial creature film, it has enough creepy tension thanks to the masterfully understated setting and mood, and the creature itself is original enough that it kept me fully engaged. The deeper undercurrents (which are a bit too overt to be called a ""subtext"") offered a really potent and emotional connection between the horror fiction of the story itself and the underlying reality of what monster's we all can be and the very real monsters than menace and stalk us within ourselves. As much a film about the heart-wrenching pain of addition and that a dysfunctional upbringing can have on a young mind and soul as it is about anything more physically sinister."
" This movie deserves a Razzie award
",2018-08-28 00:00:00,1,"What can I say!! This. Is the worst movie I have ever seen. This kid that's at least 10-12 listening to Ring-Around-The Rosey..wth!! So, nobody never seen this dumb monster!!

" Emotional and tense
",2018-08-27 00:00:00,7,"And practical effects!
Though not as emotional or hard hitting as The Strangers this is a really well made old fashioned monster movie with a modern feel."
" Well, hmmmm.....
",2018-08-11 00:00:00,5,"This movie started out nicely, building the dysfunctional relationship between the mother and daughter and setting them on a tense road trip. Once they have the accident is where things progressively get worse leading up to a crescendo of eyepopping overacting and face mugging. That little girl can bawl as much as and as well as any colicky newborn I have ever seen. It was just overdone. I understand what they were trying to do with the story, but too much can ruin a good thing. So, it's not the worst movie I've ever watched, by far, so I feel safe recommending to someone who is in a mood to tolerate a little BS with their scares. BTW, the monster was cheesy."
" Oh so slow
",2018-07-28 00:00:00,1,"I tried, I really did. I got 35 minutes in and I just can't stand it any longer. Some alcoholic trailer park mom and her kid sitting in a car is not my idea of entertainment. What was the director thinking? You have to give the audience, something, anything? The movie may be okay. I'll never know because I'm not willing to wait for something to happen. Unless you have plenty of time and are very patient, avoid this one!"

Wasted flashbacks trying to dthe fellow the characters you don't care about in the first place. Tedious is the best word I can think of. I found myself exhaling and sighing in frustration just wanting something to happen.
" Good Horror/Drama.
",2018-05-15 00:00:00,7,The Monster: A mother & her 14 year old daughter hit a wolf while driving on a lonely road. The wolf however has other strange wounds. A tow-truck arrives but the driver disappears. Minutes later his severed arm hits the windscreen. Guess hes not a handyman anymore. The film then develops into a cat & mouse struggle between the family and the monster who they see devouring the breakdown guy.Good Horror drama with a well imagined monster dragging people through windscreens and turning over vehicles. Looked like a bear-reptile hybrid. Running time 91m. 6.5/10.

" It could have been better...
",2018-04-21 00:00:00,5,"A promising premise that didn't deliver. From a technical pov, I believe the movie was really well shot and directed, with some nice cinematography. The cinematography enhanced the setting of the terrifying woods creating a tense atmosphere. The use of light and darkness for suspense was quite clever and I founf myself holding my breath in specific scenes. Unfortunately when it comes to the plot, the movie feels quite flat, unoriginal and repetitive. While the initial setting was promising, and I certainly appreciate the effort to make the characters tridimensional and highlight their emotional bond. The acting is pretty good, Zoe Kazan and Ella Ballentine certainly have chemistry on screen, which made their mother-daugther relationship very real. However, the movie falls apart on its way to the third act. I don't feel like the movie exploited the symbolism as much as it could, so much wasted potential, it did end up falling in a lot of horror clichés.Would I recommend it? 
I don't know, if you're looking for a good family drama-horror mix, with all its problems The Babdook is far more satisfying in most aspects."
" So frustrating
",2018-03-25 00:00:00,1,"The kind of movie that you yell at the screen because the actions of the characters are so dumb. 
Great idea - terrible execution"
" Lost potential
",2018-02-18 00:00:00,3,"This movie had a lot of potential going in, very classic monster movie feel. The relationship between the mother and daughter has great character dynamic as well. However, everything is basically thrown away in the last act. It's a shame that a lot of talented people did so much apparent hard work to make this movie of good quality, only to have it all trashed by terrible writing in the last act. The movie would have been better had they ended it when the ambulance went off the road. That wouldn't be a great ending but it would be better than the trash they tacked on at the end. The whole monster doesn't like light thing is clamy and not consistent in the movie. The Mom suicide/sacrifice is unmotivated. The girl stopping the monster in midair with an aresol can, is just bad all the way around. The monster can stop a moving ambulance, but aerosol yielded by a little girl is too much for it. Then is the monster made of purely flameable material, because it went up like a bonfire with just a kiss of flame? Really? All this throwing away of a good movie for some half baked, backwards message that little girls are empowered to fight the monsters on their own."
" The creature of the coming-of-age lagoon.
",2018-02-04 00:00:00,7,"7/10 A decent little movie set in one location with strong performances. Great cinematography and small-scale conflicts make it very personal for the audience. The monster itself is scarier in a metaphorical context rather than a physical one. The tension is sometimes interrupted by flashbacks, which are heartwarming. If you enjoy movies with deeper meanings and themes, you'll probably enjoy this one."
" WOW! I'm blown away!!!
",2017-12-27 00:00:00,10,"I just watched this on a whim on Amazon Prime. I thought it was just going to be another schlock monster movie with bad acting, bad script, bad everything. This was not only one of the best Horror Movies I've seen in a long time, but also one of the best films I've seen in a long time. I had to give it a 10 for my appreciation of the utmost talent involved here. From Direction, script, editing, and SUPERLATIVE acting. I actually cried at the end, and that is no mean feat. I rarely review any film on here, but this film is just special. Yeah it was an analogy, a metaphor, and we got an actor in a monster suit, but I remember the good old days. Crappy CGI would destroyed the effect, and have made it less poignant. I must say the little girl who played Lizzie is one of the best young actresses I've ever seen. But her mom was just as good. She traversed a wondrous arc between the lowest to highest range. I just loved this film. This is not a movie, it is a film. There's a difference. This one resonates. I'm looking forward to seeing so much more from all involved. Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
" Solid drama, weak frights
",2017-12-06 00:00:00,6,"6 1/2Two distinct souls coexist in the same movie : we have the complicated relationship background between mother and daughter, which is very touching and wisely built, and the horror/slasher counterpart, that is definitely less thought out, rougher and conventional. All in all, they tend to mash up pretty well, converging in the end in a cathartic epilogue, but there's some flaws along the way that kinda lower the level."
" Started out okay, but got annoying and stupid at the End
",2017-10-26 00:00:00,3,"This movie was really disappointing for me.While I did enjoy the first few flashbacks and the general story for about half the film, towards the end it just got annoying and ridiculous.Am I really supposed to believe that the girl who was whiny and cowering for the whole movie suddenly grows into some Mary Sue (TM) hero by the end? And killing the monster with fire in the way it happened is just ridiculously unrealistic, even for a movie like this.It's a shame. There are some things this movie gets right, I particularly liked the acting on the mothers part, even if some of the dialogue was shoddy. The monster design in general was good too and I always appreciate practical effects over CGI.The character of the daughter angered me more and more as the film went on with all her whining and annoying questions, though that is more the fault of the script than the actress, she's actually pretty decent.All in all, very disappointing."
" There are no such tings as monsters...
",2017-10-21 00:00:00,6,"Here's a Fresh Meat review of ""The Monster"" (R - 2016 - US)...Better than I thought!!Genre: Horror/Monster My Score: 6.2Cast=3 Acting=8 Plot=7 Ending=6 Story=5 Scare=6 Jump=5 F/X=8 Monster=8 Gore=6A mother and daughter set out on a road trip and hit an animal. With their car inoperable and stranded in the middle of nowhere...the creature they hit begins hunting them.""My mom tells me there's no such thing as monsters...but she is wrong."" It starts out slow and frustrating...like waiting two hours to get your food when all you ordered was a breakfast burrito. But after all the hesitations and false starts, the fit really hits the shan and the brutality increases (see how I switched that?) to an enjoyable level. The cinematics were dark and rainy, but the monster was pretty cool. The daughter made the movie for me, but Scott Speedman had nothing more than a cameo. If you can suffer through the first half, the second half is a good watch."
" Completely Gerenic and Boring
",2017-09-29 00:00:00,2,"The story is so generic that it's unbelievable. The mother hits a dog or a ""wolf"" and her car doesn't work anymore because of that hit. The dead animal is missing.Hmm, I guess the monster took the corpse in the middle of the road and the mother and daughter didn't notice it.When the tow truck guy is outside and the monster is approaching him, the mother and daughter shout at him to turn around yet their windows are closed.How the fvck do you expect him to hear you shouting inside the car when your windows are closed? And why was the monster dragging his body from underneath the car when the monster is a size of a black bear? When the ambulance finally arrives (of course the two people from the ambulance are going to die since those two characters aren't important at all), the monster throws the guy's body at the windshield.Seriously, what is up with the monster throwing people's body and pieces at windshields? It's not scaring anyone.When the mother drives the ambulance and makes the audience think they're finally safe, the monster (for some odd reason) catches up to the ambulance and rams its head to the side of the ambulance and the retard mother starts losing control of the steering wheel.Are you fvcking kidding me? There's no way in Hell that monster was strong enough to move a truck just by ramming its head on it.The film keeps showing us flashbacks so we can know more about the relationship between the mother, daughter, and the dad (sort of). Am I supposed to care about their background story? The two main characters don't interest me at all.I find it hilarious how the monster runs away whenever someone flashes a flashlight at its face.The little girl kills the monster just by using a lighter and a spray and use them as a flamethrower. That's it? How creative.This movie is so fvcking stupid. The story is so simple that a little kid can easily come up with it."
" If you're happy and you know it...
",2017-09-03 00:00:00,8,"Lizzy (Ella Ballentine) is being taken to her dad's house by someone who was not the prefect mom (Zoe Kazan). The film starts off showing us Lizzy is a well adjusted daughter considering her alcoholic mother who is less than understanding. They encounter difficulty along the road on a rainy night...in need of a tow truck and ambulance to fill the time. Yes there is a ""monster"" that we do get to see as Elizabeth has flashbacks to her life, none of which was good.This is a well acted film. You feel the intensity of the relationship between mother and daughter, as well as the sadness. With the various details and aspects at work, Bryan Bertino (director/writer) has turned a good jump scare story into a metaphor of facing and conquering our own monster in order to move on.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
" Monsters come in all forms
",2017-08-31 00:00:00,9,"Just watched this and loved it. Another smart addition to the encouragingly robust genre of smart and allegorically innovative horror movies. My take? The monster is simply Kathy's addiction, as experienced by daughter Lizzy. it attacks when she's vulnerableit removes people who are there to protect her (Lizzy's father (the actual addiction)/ the tow truck guy and the paramedics (the metaphorical monster))shining a light on it/ acknowledging it weakens itonce you've acknowledged it, you're in a better place, but you still have to go through withdrawal and might be too damaged to pull through (Kathy vomiting blood in the woods due to her internal injuries)despite your best intentions, innocents will still suffer because of it. (Lizzy undergoes her mother's ""overdose"" and death, and then still has to grapple with the monster on her own.)Finally, the ultimate version of ""shining a light on something"", i.e. setting it on fire, is what allows her to be free, albeit with a forever altered view of her own safety, and the security of the world in general. [ Fun add on-- she had to sacrifice her childhood/ innocence, i.e. her singing teddy bear, in order to finally overcome the monster. ]A lot of people are commenting on the weird/ unbelievable choices made by the characters in the third act. If you're looking at it as a straight up horror movie, I could understand that. But seeing it through the lens of the pretty obvious analogy that was being made about addiction, they all felt totally spot on to me. Definitely recommend!"
" This is not a monster movie
",2017-07-23 00:00:00,8,"This is a monster movie in the same way that Pan's Labyrinth is a monster movie; there's a horrible beast in it, but it is only secondary to the plot.The trailer and description of this movie do it no justice. This is a movie about the relationship between an alcoholic abusive mother and her daughter, and it is at times difficult to watch because of the raw intensity in the scenes. I found the emotions and actions to be very realistic, and the love/hate relationship from both sides - but especially the daughter - is written perfectly; fans of child psychology will eat this up.OK, so the monster is there. It is done very well, and the tension derived from the horror aspects are well handled too. With only a few jump scares, the movie relies more on the darkness and mood to cause you unease. There is some action around the monster that is too light in treatment, but remember, this is not a movie about the monster. And in that sense, the cursory treatment makes more sense.The symbolism is obvious in retrospect, but it is a bit more literal than fantastical, unlike Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth. You can very much take this movie at face value; as if the action is really happening. But there's an entirely other level to it if you want to take the leap. We all have demons, and these two characters have their fair share that manifest themselves in a few ways on screen.I really enjoyed this movie and was moved to tears. It is bittersweet; at the same time horrifying, raw, and very dark in soul, but yet leaves you with a sense that one can still go on, despite enormous trials and tragedies. For those who've had difficult relationships with a family member, or have faced incredible loss, it is especially touching. It's a rare movie that can stir a full range of emotions. It's not perfect, but the talented cast and crew put together something that will stick with me for a long time. Kudos to them all."
" It will make you cry with following scenes!
",2017-07-20 00:00:00,10,"If you have problem about mother and daughter family drama, then i suggest you not to watch it. This is an extremely touching movie. Well combined with horror (not exactly horror its literally symbols..).Its not an horror movie.. its Gothic movie with a lot lot messages. Congrats to team for not making some psyhotic drama thing."
" A decent stab at a legit film
",2017-07-06 00:00:00,5,"I respect where Bryan Bertino was trying to go with this film, but he falls short. While he does gets a decent start on character development that mostly works despite some overwrought writing and acting, the static set piece and drawn out end battle bleed away any real tension. Flashbacks are overused and ultimately come too late and the well shot and creepy final locations overstay their welcome. Few films are able to pull off this Babadook-esque having your cake and eating it too morality monster mash, and despite a good college try, the Monster fails along with all the others."
" Don't go ... outside the car
",2017-06-19 00:00:00,7,"The relationship between the mother and her child is the number one priority here. So while this is a horror movie (mostly in the psychological area), it is also a Drama. And some of the best Horror movies (that are not Slashers or particularly explicitly violent) have been Dramas at heart too.And while I get that the child may seem annoying to some and some decisions made feel rushed, the casting was good and the script was decent enough giving them all something to play with (no pun intended). The movie is very dark (both in tone and in visual flair) and while it does drift into expected (read cliché territory) and has somewhat of a downfall towards the end (and maybe for some a slow beginning), overall the positive things do win over ..."
" An Intense, Solid Monster Movie
",2017-06-11 00:00:00,8,"Far too often these days we are given a horror film that promises to scare us while delivering very few scares. Sure a well-made movie that doesn't depend on displaying anything on screen can be an unnerving experience. But that seems to be the main rather than the exception these days and thus results in far too many movies that are all atmosphere with no meat on their bones. THE MONSTER combines that with an actual on screen creature that will hold you in it's grip.The story revolves around a young girl named Lizzy (Ella Ballentine) who just wants a normal life. Unfortunately that's not likely to happen. Her mother Kathy (Zoe Kazan) is an alcoholic party girl who has yet to mature and realize this is not a good way of life for herself or her daughter. This lifestyle sets up the deepest narrative of the movie with a love/hate relationship between the two. Lizzy loves her mother and takes care of her more than the reverse but at the same time hates who her mother is. Kathy loves Lizzy but is so entrenched in her own habits that she can't focus enough to provide what she wants for her daughter.The stage is set for a change. Lizzy's father, who left because of Kathy's lifestyle choices, is now taking over Lizzy's life. The pair is set to travel to his house so Lizzy can live there. But of course a late night of drinking means Kathy has woken late and they now must travel at night. Rain kicks on while they are on the road traveling a well wooded area, resulting in a wolf running across the road in front of them and their hitting him. With a slightly damaged car they call a repair service even though it's very late and then sit and wait.Then something happens. Lizzy notices that the wolf who was in the middle of the road is now gone. Having checked it she is certain that it was dead and yet no wolf. While checking things out Lizzy hears a growling in the woods and returns to the car. The tow service arrives and begins working on their car. He's attacked and taken by the monster without the mother-daughter couple noticing. When they do discover him missing Lizzy's worst fears are confirmed. There is indeed something out there.As viewers we're in for a treat. While the monster in question is at first nothing more than a growl or the appearance of perhaps a hand reaching out, we eventually get the payoff of seeing the monster in all of its slimy, glistening glory, big teeth and all. One way or another the pair fend off the attacks of this creature with the hope of prevailing and making it out alive. This is where the true terror kicks in. In the past both would live happily ever after. The current wave of horror films will see both of them torn to bits as the monster awaits another victim. As viewers we sit and wait to find out which of these scenarios will play out. Or will there be something new and original? One thing to consider while watching this is just who the title is referring to. Is it the creature that lurks in the woods killing off unsuspecting travelers who happen by? Is it the mother who should be acting like an adult and raising her child properly rather than behaving like the child in this situation? Or is it the daughter who loves her mother yet at the same time has wished her dead due to her antics? Or is the answer all of the above? Well made, well-crafted and well acted. The movie provides enough scares to keep you on the edge of your seat and enough story to have you thinking about the topics on hand from start to finish. At no time does it opt for an easy way out and that means the end result is a satisfying monster movie that should please fans of the genre more than many films being released these days."
" The real terror is the annoying script
",2017-05-26 00:00:00,1,"You really just want to punch these characters in the face more and more as the film progresses. With every new instance of whining, cursing and pointless bickering, you feel the anger and frustration swell inside you. I wanted the monster to eat them and get it over with. I have never seen characters that annoyed me so much and made me hate them. And it took less than 30 minutes for that to happen. It's amazing. Add to that the poorly written dialogue and plot, and you get one difficult movie to endure. Forget the terror coming from the threat the monster poses. The real terror is waiting for the characters' mouths to open, as one anticipates the crap that is about to come out. The characters are so poorly written that they are not even consistent in their annoying behaviour. Oh no. The scared girl who five minutes earlier wouldn't even leave the car suddenly enters the woods for no reason. Then she sees something scary, but still doesn't run back to the car, and instead calls to her mother who (as everyone in the audience knows by now) has no intention of paying attention to her. See, if we know she is not going to answer, but the girl (who, as the first act of the film has established, knows how deranged her mother is better than anyone in the world) acts as though she doesn't, that makes the audience angry and frustrated. Unfortunately, almost every round of dialogue between characters and every action they undertake is at best questionable, if not outright nonsensical. I was screaming by the time the monster made its appearance, but not from terror; I was screaming at the characters, hoping they would die."
" Wonderful genre film
",2017-05-11 00:00:00,10,"Bryan Bertino is such a unique voice in this genre. I highly recommend seeing this movie and it will surprise you in more than one way. Everyone in this movie gives great performances and the movie looks fantastic. Without giving anything away, you'd probably be surprised about how character driven this film really is. I just loved it."
" Great low budget monster flick
",2017-04-22 00:00:00,8,"Now this is how you make a low budget horror movie in the 2010's. It's obvious that this film does not have over the top production values, there's very few actors and limited sets; but this film does more than good with what it does have. The cinematography is absolutely stunning with some gorgeous scenery in the beginning and at the end. Most of this movie is shot in the woods at night, and so one would expect it to be a poorly-lit affair with lots of shaky camera shots like so many similar films of late- however this is where The Monster excels. The cinematographer makes great use of light and dark, using it to make visible just what you need to see and to create tension with what you don't. The monster isn't shown until 3/4 of the way through the movie and looks downright terrifying. It is quite a slow burn and so some without patience may get bored but if you manage to get to the 40 minute mark you won't regret it. The backstory is also really good, I don't think I've ever seen a monster flick with this much characterization. It's emotional and adds real depth to the characters and what they go through in the woods. I was very pleasantly surprised and hopefully if you watch this movie, you will be too."
" Emotionally Compelling and Original
",2017-04-19 00:00:00,8,"This movie is emotionally compelling and original rather than formulaic. The dynamic between the mother and daughter was beautifully developed, ultimately allowing you to contrast the devastation left by real horrors in life, such as losing a loved one, to the scare sometimes brought by fictional horror story monsters. If you are looking for camp, this is not for you. Also, keep an open mind about genre. This is not typical."
" Underrated
",2017-04-17 00:00:00,7,"Very interesting. I love the monster movies and this one did not disappoint me.Is not perfect at all, but I can see beyond the typical flaws in this type of movies to see a more thoughtful film.Mixing drama with terror is not new, may taste more or less, but simplicity and effectiveness are overwhelming. Good photography, tension, the design of the monster was OK, definitely on the poster its more striking, it is not the best design that I've seen, definitely it could be more creative but at the same time it could been much worse, but it had its meaning and it was there to reflect the issues mother and daughter had between them. The monster is a metaphor, a symbol (quite obvious)so we can get that out of the way, as it also has a physical presence and dose undoubtedly exist as a tormentor for both protagonists shaking their relationship and testing them.It is clear that most horror stories suffer from quality, I thought it was a brave proposal.The performances of mother and daughter are very remarkable and the fact of not having the typical mother all powerful that saves the day seemed as a fresh interesting premise.The film has a good atmosphere despite the lack of variety of scenarios, almost everything happens in one place, but that did not prevent generating tension and suspense in the anteroom at the appearance of the monster and everything that comes later, with some Dose of hemoglobin without exaggeration.The Monster is a good horror movie with a more interesting message,Is recommended for all who are looking for a new approach to classic monster movies"
" Monsters do exist for all of us.
",2017-04-10 00:00:00,7,"Kathy (Zoe Kazan) is a young chain-smoking, alcohol abusing mother that is taking her teen daughter Lizzy (Ella Ballentine) back to her father's house. Driving late at night in the rain on a deserted detour due to road construction, the car is damaged after hitting a wounded wolf in the dense forest. Waiting for assistance, the daughter at times seems more mature than her mother. When the dead wolf is dragged off the road and the wrecker driver trying to make some repairs is attacked; it becomes apparent that mommy lied when she said monsters do not exist.It can easily be called a depressing movie by some; but I however really liked the atmosphere of the pouring down rain, thunder and lightning in the forest. Plus knowing there is something unnatural lurking to pounce. Scary, dark and ominous; a heavy emotional horror film. The monster is not the meanest and scariest looking, but he is there...in the dark.Flashbacks are used in telling the intimate story of the broken relationship between Lizzy and her mother. Not that the script or dialogue is anywhere near outstanding, Miss Ballentine proves to have a promising career. She is the talented of the cast that also features Aaron Douglas, John Brooks and Chris Webb.Written and directed by Bryan Bertino. THE MONSTER does feature violence and terror, but the R rating may have more to do with the language."
" Genius Until....
",2017-04-06 00:00:00,7,"Mr. Bertino, you had me absolutely spellbound with ""The Monster"" in all its aspects, that is, until you showed the monster. Didn't 1963's ""The Haunting"" teach you anything? It's not what's seen; it's what you're afraid you'll see. The audience's imagination was creating something much more frightening than the typical Hollywood werewolf-like thing you used. (Points for not caving in to CGI...but not many.)And here's something else: Why not make the monster a metaphor for the mother's addiction? (You certainly developed THAT aspect of her!) And the entire forest episode, a figment of daughter Lizzy's imagination? Lizzy's mother's self-sacrifice, the love that Lizzy yearned for? Lizzy's facing the horror, the inner strength that she's had to call on as a child forced to parent a parent? Why couldn't you do something along those lines? You obviously have the talent. What a powerful film THAT would have been.Instead, you filmed a high school kid's urban legend. And you were doing so well...."
" Slow, but With Purpose
",2017-04-04 00:00:00,7,"This movie is one we've seen before, but it's done in a bone-chilling way. I went into this film with low expectations, having seen the horrid reviews online, but I came out pretty pleased. Pros: The suspense in this movie is phenomenal. The shots are killer. The location is fantastically chilling. The monster itself is horrifying, and sadistic. As a fun horror movie this delivers the spooks. It made me uncomfortable in all the best ways.The monster is cool. I think so, at least. If you had to sum up the concept of ""Monster"" into one creature than this is what it would be. The Monster. I think it's simple design works. The dynamic between the mother and daughter is really interesting and well-acted. It's a dynamic we've never really seen before in a horror movie, and the flashbacks offer up nice tidbits about how they really feel for each other. You care for them. Cons: The flashbacks, although they do wonders for the characters, disturb the flow and tension a lot. I found myself wanting to fast forward through them just to get back to the car scenes. The monster is shown FAR too much. There are beautiful shots in here where the monster is just out of focus, or just out of frame, and it does so much to help the atmosphere. Had they continued that all the way through this movie could have been fantastic! Ultimately, if you're a horror fanatic check it out. I think it's worth a watch. It's a fun time. Great setting, great looking monster, and an intriguing cast. I'd say it's worth a watch."
" Well thought out, but with subliminal messages.
",2017-04-02 00:00:00,7,"Within the first 10 minutes of the film, it becomes immediately obvious that this film is about a lot more than just a human-hungry beast. Call me crazy, but the constant switching from the girls past and the present monster problem gave me the idea that the monster was a purely psychological metaphor. The poor girls life seems to be falling apart before it's really had a chance to begin. I really liked the film because it portrays domestic violence, alcoholism and drug abuse in a very clear light, an issue I myself grew up in, making me able to really relate to the girl in the film. The main issue I have though is that the monster has absolutely no back story, no beginning, no end, there's just a random creature that has appeared from nowhere living in the forest, preying on wildlife until a human happens by. The movie does not tend to focus much on the actual monster at all. Again I say, I feel that the monster represents what the girl fears the most, and that which in the end, causes her to lose some of the things that mean the most to her.I would recommend this film to those who have lived through a situation like this. It's a good monster movie, and the monster itself has a wonderful design. It's the message that I like the most though. ""Monsters are real, and they're waiting out there for you""."
" Wonderfully Wicked
",2017-04-01 00:00:00,8,"When I started The Monster, I was expecting some cheap crappy horror movie that was just all about the gore and CGI to stay afloat. I was wrong.The Monster begins with our two main characters, Kathy and Lizzie packing for Lizzie to go to her Dad's. They're shown to have a bad relationship with each other, and Lizzie is shown as more of the mother than Kathy is. It's heart breaking and we're made to feel bad for Lizzie as she begins the journey with her mother. Everything is going relatively smoothly until something causes them to crash the car in an old road that's barely used. What follows next is a tense fight for survival. Over time we are subjected to flashbacks from Kathy and Lizzie's life, showing their family life as Lizzie has grown up. This is all symbolic to the character development in the movie, and is important to know for this exact reason.The techniques used in this movie to create tension are brilliant. I found myself to have horrendous goosebumps and couldn't stop shuddering. It was a beautiful use of talent on the cinematographers part, and the editing team did really well – other than there was one error where they drove past the same furniture on the side of the road twice; bad editing moment.The only qualm I had in this was how horribly CGIed the monster was. It was cringe worthy and hard to watch, for myself, watching this ball of CGI run around the screen. It was the only thing I didn't like about the movie, however.I think it has a strong premise. It's well done and I really enjoyed it. A solid 8/10 from me, and a recommendation to horror movie fans."
" A review of ""The Monster"" (2016)
",2017-03-19 00:00:00,8,"What a neat little horror movie. ""Monster"" (2016) is unencumbered by any sort of belabored mystery or backstory — or even the need for familiarity with werewolf or vampire lore. Its title baddie appears to simply be a horrible, nameless, forest-dwelling predator that waylays and assails a mother and her young daughter along a lonely highway at night. The story's simplicity alone makes it interesting.And it's a well crafted, thoughtful story. It focuses heavily on its characters while its plot-driving antagonist is concealed in the rainswept woods, and the movie's extensive use of flashbacks isn't too jarring and is generally very good. We see two interwoven stories — the first is a bare-bones scary campfire tale, while the second is about a mother-daughter relationship effectively destroyed by alcoholism. The flashbacks do not feel like filler, nor are they maudlin. They pack a decent enough emotional punch and, despite being sparsely scripted, they seem to reflect a sophisticated understanding of alcoholism on the part of screenwriter and director Bryan Bertino.Bertino also shot this movie beautifully, making the most of its primary location on a rainy rural road. It looks just great, and the isolated, pretty and nearly surreal environment here lends itself well to the movie's horror elements.The many positive reviews for ""The Monster"" point to a great performance by Zoe Kazan; I definitely agree with them. Equal credit, I think, should go to 15-year-old Ella Ballentine (who is playing a much younger character here). She brings a mixture of vulnerability and intensity to her role  I actually think Bertino could have improved his story somewhat by allowing her to have a bit more pathos, and having her fight a bit more — both against her mother and against the monster. In the latter half of the movie, she does feel underused when depicted only as an imperiled child.If I had a major criticism of ""The Monster,"" I'd suggest that it is maybe 20 or 30 minutes too long. Yes, the simplicity of the story is what makes it interesting. But  it also feels like too little to sustain the full length of a feature film. There  actually isn't a hell of a lot of story here.I would also better conceal the monster itself to the shadows. We do indeed get a good look at it — and its artistic design is actually great. But Bertino obviously didn't have a tremendous special effects budget, and it shows a little — particularly when the monster should be shown moving. For a movie that succeeds so well in being character-driven, I think a less-is-more approach would have worked just fine here.I'd rate this movie an 8 out of 10 and I'd recommend it.Weird trivia — that violent, abusive prick of a boyfriend that we see in flashbacks? That's none other than Scott Speedman, who plays nice-guy Michael Corvin in the ""Underworld"" movies. I thought that was funny."
" 'The Monster' Succeeds In Drama But Struggles In Horror
",2017-02-23 00:00:00,3,"OVERVIEW: Young Lizzy (Ella Ballentine) embarks on a road trip with her alcoholic mother Kathy (Zoe Kazan). The two have a strained relationship filled with drunken nights, hungover mornings, and verbal abuse. Lizzy, ready for a visit with her Dad, requests that they drive through the night instead of making any pit stops. The less time she spends with her mother, the better.While passing through dense woods late at night, made no better by rain, Kathy hits a wolf. The two get out to examine the poor animal and find a large tooth embedded in its side. While Kathy assumes it was another animal, Lizzy has a feeling there is something more menacing out there. As the mysterious creature slowly unveils itself and becomes more violent, the two must put their differences aside and fight for survival.THOUGHTS: Part creature feature, part family drama, The Monster is a moderate horror film that favors a slower pace. With an intriguing monster and background story, it's disappointing that this film struggled with many of the easier scenes. It's within the horror-centric scenes where many of its faults lie.We have a very complex story about a neglected child and her alcoholic mother. Their relationship and issues are played out in a series of flashbacks as they are trapped in the woods. While the story is wonderfully told in general, and their issues with each other unfold in a heartbreaking and unsuspecting way, the faults within the horror side of this film prove to be something the viewer can't help but nag at.There are those typical clichéd moves that characters make that are obviously annoying to some degree. It's sometimes the stupidity of these characters, and their means of survival, that are hard to grasp. There are just better ways to approach storytelling on a horror side than what this film provided. It was quite surprising to find that Bryan Bertino, who wrote and directed 2008's The Strangers, also wrote and directed this film. The pacing is very similar, and stylistically as well. As far as actual horror and capability of these characters, I feel there's a disconnect from his previous work.While it's an okay horror film, certainly not the worst I've seen, I find myself wanting to correct its mistakes more than I felt I enjoyed watching it. It's a drama that just so happens to take place during an event that would be best fit to count as a scary movie, but it's not. I didn't hate it, just very underwhelmed."
" Beware Flashbacks!
",2017-02-20 00:00:00,5,"A solid 5 rated movie that could easily have been better. Effects were good. Acting was good, there is a small cast of 4. Story is passable, the problem is how the story is told. Flashbacks unless directly, related to real time event, really slows the story and jars audience. The use of flashbacks was to build and build and build upon mother and daughter's relationship and though it did that, the flashbacks did not really move story along. Movie felt 20 to 30 minutes too long."
" VIEWS ON FILM review of The Monster
",2017-02-11 00:00:00,5,"I'm starting to get really annoyed by the use of flashbacks in film. 2016's The Monster (my latest review) has them in the form of an alcoholic mother battling with her vexing daughter. Do said flashbacks form an adequate background story for ""Monster?"" Somewhat. Am I to a degree, still annoyed? Oh for sure.I'm also starting to get exasperated by the use of scary movie clichés. The Monster has them by way of a car stalling after hitting an animal, heavy rain that won't stop, and the protagonists being stranded in the middle of nowhere. Does ""Monster's"" director (Bryan Bertino) film these scenes admirably and with a sense of style? Sort of. Am I again, still exasperated? Yup.Anyway, The Monster which stars Zoe Kazan and Ella Ballentine, clocks in at just under eighty-five minutes (ninety-one if you count the credits). Watching it, I realized that its budget is relatively low. That's a good thing because ""Monster's"" box office take is currently a paltry $62,953. Bryan Bertino (The Strangers) is a manageable filmmaker but he shoots ""Monster's"" kill sequences in such heavy darkness. It's hard to tell what's really going on. Heck, I could've used some night- vision goggles if you know what I mean.Now The Monster is indeed a flick about a monster. This slimy savage has long sharp teeth, a hunchback disposition, and a standard growl. It appears similar to the mucky gremlin from Twilight Zone: The Movie, the aliens from Aliens, or the basement demon from 1983's Amityville 3- D. It terrorizes Kazan and Ballentine's characters yet doesn't show up till forty-five minutes in. The effect I guess, is to evoke early Ridley Scott, Spielberg's method with Jaws, or something Hitchcockian. Sadly, it's all a bit underwhelming.Questions I asked myself during The Monster: Is this ugly beast who lives in a Canadian forest, a product of chemical waste disposal? Maybe. Was it dropped by a spacecraft into the Earth's banal atmosphere? Sure, why not. Finally, did it emerge from a meteorite all angry and bloodthirsty? I guess so. Truthfully, I don't think an audience member will ever know. Furthermore, I don't think the filmmakers themselves even know. I guess that concept wasn't discussed during the production meetings.In veracity, I didn't feel scared or frightened while viewing The Monster. It has no real jolts and or jump back moments. That's probably because I've seen all these types of creature features many times over.The raw acting by Ballentine and Kazan helps a little but their troupers are portrayed in such a downtrodden way. Ella Ballentine plays Lizzy and basically she is reprising her role from Standoff (another 2016 release). She's the sad and solemn girl who gets neglected and suffers through a crappy childhood. Zoe Kazan channels Kathy, her tattooed, lower-class mother. Startlingly, Kazan looks more like Ballentine's big sister than her emotionally distraught mommy. The two of them could come off as heroines but they more or less project a couple of people destined to be on The Jerry Springer Show. Ouch.In conclusion, The Monster is a rental that doesn't make any quantum leap in the horror genre. It's not deficient but you'd be better off checking out Charlize Theron's 2003 crime drama of virtually the same name. ""Monster's"" boisterous rating: 2 stars."
" Crying in the Rain...A Creature Feature Awash in Emotion and Terror
",2017-02-09 00:00:00,7,"Tight, Taut Creature Feature with Psychological and Domestic Issues at the Foundation of the Imagination and Reality of a Mother Daughter Dysfunction.Two Strong Performances from Zoe Kazan (Mom) and Ella Ballentine (Lizzy) center the Story that Unfolds on a Dark Rainy Night on a Rural Road where the Two are Stranded after an Auto Accident.Flashbacks Fill in the Backstory as They are Literally Awash in Cleansing Tears and Rain and the Fractured Bonding seems to be Therapeutically Helpful. However, there are Physical ""Monsters"" Afoot that are as Dangerous as the ones from the Psyche.Horror Fans who Love Their Creatures to be Front and Center, both in the Frame and in the Story might find things Disappointing for at least 2/3 of the Movie. The Third Act is Brutal and Bloody, the First Two Acts are Heartbreaking and Gut-Wrenching.Overall, it's a Well Done Little Movie, but it Pulls the Audience in so many Directions that the Balance doesn't seem quite Right. There's something Missing to make the Whole Thing Work as well as Intended. It's a Good One and Worth a Watch for Fans of the Genre, but it's Not Likely to Please Everyone."
" Creepy and messy
",2017-02-07 00:00:00,6,"Creepy because the movie did generate some compelling tension and scares. Messy in that the mother-daughter angle did not always make sense or add what was intended. About my reviews: I do not offer a synopsis of the film -- you can get that anywhere and that does not constitute a meaningful review -- but rather my thoughts and feelings on the film that hopefully will be informative to you in deciding whether to invest 90-180 minutes of your life on it.My scale: 1-5 decreasing degrees of ""terrible"", with 5 being ""mediocre"" 6- OK. Generally held my interest OR had reasonable cast and/or cinematography, might watch it again 7 - Good. My default rating for a movie I liked enough to watch again, but didn't rise to the upper echelons 8- Very Good. Would watch again and recommend to others 9- Outstanding. Would watch over and over; top 10% of my ratings 10 - A Classic. (Less than 2% receive this rating)"
" Truly Awful
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,1,"I would not recommend wasting your time watching this horrible horrible so called ""movie"". Watch something else. I give it a thumbs down. The ""monster"" was really badly made and in addition the acting was over done. The action that was shown is also unrealistic and might as well been left out. Please Please!!! Do not watch this fail attempt of a movie. There are parts where both of the mother and daughter could of made it out alive and they choose to stay. Either way they both should of died. At least the mom whos bad acting didn't make it. Her heavy breathing was annoying no doubt for her being a real smoker. That is all I could focus on the entire movie."
" Cujo in the Woods
",2017-02-06 00:00:00,5,"Bertino made a giant splash in the horror scene a decade ago with THE STRANGERS, a movie that was able to take a well-worn plot device and do something memorable and terrifying with it. To me, so much of what made that film successful was Bertino's direction. Let's face it, we've all seen a thousand home invasion horror films. We've all seen villains in plastic Halloween masks. The suspense and pure terror that Bertino was able to create in that movie, though, through some wonderful camera shots and scenes so tense you truly sat at the edge of your seat, made the movie stand out so well from the pack. I've been waiting for him to bring that fine-tuned edge of horror back to hungry fans.I had read some good reviews of this movie and was honestly hoping for the best. I didn't expect another instant classic like THE STRANGERS. I was just looking for good indie horror. Unfortunately, I was a little bit let down. There is nothing that really stands out about this movie. Essentially, you could make the argument that it's THE STRANGERS all over again. Sure, the kids have been replaced with a mysterious monster and the house has been replaced with a car. In the end, most horror films boil down to a few basic plots with a new coat of paint and this is really just the NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD/ ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 blueprint in a car, with a monster. It's still our main characters trapped in a claustrophobic environment while the invading threat tries to get in. I would argue that it borrow a great deal from CUJO, as well. Much like THE STRANGERS, at the heart of it is another dysfunctional family pairing. In this one, a young girl and her alcoholic, abusive mother.The two young women playing our starring roles are probably the only good thing about this movie, though both of them started to work on my nerves by the end of the movie. I don't expect Oscar worthy acting in my indie horror, so I'm usually pleasantly surprised when I find someone playing a fully fleshed out character with some style and that's exactly what we get from both. The daughter is very typical of a young woman in an abusive relationship and the mother is like too many people I've known in my life, thrust into parenthood at too young an age and not ready to grow up enough to face the responsibility that comes with it. Both, though, push that edge of annoying. They are not people you would want to spend time with in real life, but you could argue that's a mark of a good performance.Unfortunately, the relationship plays out in a series of never- ending flashbacks that keep killing any tension that the movie is trying to make. I applaud the script writer for trying to show this relationship in a unique manner, rather than having our characters explain everything to us in bad dialog, or lengthy conversations meant to interject some history. In the end, though, there are just too many flashbacks and they started to feel like a desperate bid to fill run time in the movie.I liked the decision to keep our monster mostly in shadows. This was probably an effect of the budget, but a choice I'm fine with having come from a love of classic horror. Too many indie horror films make the mistake of showing us too much bad creature makeup. For the first hour of this movie, it does a pretty decent job of building up tension and fear and created a mood of claustrophobic terror. It's hard to build 90 minutes in a car, though, with a monster that's big enough to simply knock out a window, so eventually we leave the car and that's when things start to spin into slightly ridiculous mode and any good will the movie was building with me was killed by a finale with too many forced events thrown into it and a push to take the message of the movie far too seriously."
" Horrible
",2017-02-05 00:00:00,1,"This was just one horrible movie. With the most funniest monster and the most funniest scary plots. Like just lost what was the director wanting with this movie. And i am overly surprised IMDb is having a rating more then 5 for this. The movie is simply horrible, a bad recipe with bad directed scenes and unwanted too. What was the monster? If it was scared of lights then why not all the time. Which part of US is like so barren and has street lights. The toll truck driver had a light too and whats the idea of cutting his hand first then eating it. And then why eating only them why leaving the others. And get affected when being hit with a torch and the girl in the end becoming all super. Torching up the monster so easily as if it was covered with petrol and the girl coming up with the brilliant idea with finding a place to hide after the stupid mother unnecessarily sacrificing her and the daughter then coming to safe her. If you are reading all this and thinking what kind of crap i am writing then imagine the movie. -100 for me. Wasted my weekend"
" Definitely a Monster
",2017-02-04 00:00:00,8,"Well, this monster looks familiar (seen incarnations before), but that's alright as he/she came with just the right attitude. Could have used some smelling & hearing apparatus though, but I suppose the eyes make up for it especially since it's a night prowler. Strange how such terror can live so close to civilization and not be noticed before, oh well - details. Or, perhaps, the girl's hatred of her mother brought it into existence? Anyway, riveting acting by daughter and mom. Kudos to them. Dialogue, camera, sets, dark & rainy scenes all well done. Two fewer stars because the ending was too simplistic, neat & tidy, and not as believable."
" Oh, what the hell was that?
",2017-02-02 00:00:00,4,"I'd seen the trailer for this movie and thought it looks like a nice tight tense thriller/horror like Open Water and Frozen (no, not the horrible Disney movie). And I like Zoe Kazan, think she is a really under rated actress. On the plus side, the acting and cinematography is not bad at all. But my main problem with this movie is that it didn't know what it wanted to be.It stated off like a full on melodrama about an alcoholic mother (Kazan) and her pretty damaged daughter, so much so, I started to think I was watching the wrong movie. It then lurched, uneasily into the thriller/horror I assumed it was. The problem being it was not particularly thrilling or horrible. By the time the monster made its appearance, you were pretty emotionally detached from the characters to really care what happened to them. The monster itself was OK, and would have worked better in a tighter, more focused film.All in all, it's not a terrible movie, it just not a good movie. Sorry to say."
" Drama, Horror and Plenty of emotions.
",2017-01-29 00:00:00,7,"The Monster (2016) from the same director of The Strangers (2008), my expectations to this film were limited, didn't know what to expect but a scary movie about a monster, fortunately the movie serves way more than this.The movie discusses the relationship between mothers and daughters in a very beautiful way and how strong that bond is even at the worst times, then it uses the horror factor as a metaphor to show the real bond between them, and whatever problems happen between them just fade away when they're about to lose each other, So I thought this was smart and very nicely done.The acting in this film is probably one of the best I have recently seen, I was very attached to the characters and actually cared for them, as for the horror there are some effective jump scares and the mood is very dark the whole movie, also the atmosphere of this film sucks you even though when there isn't a lot going on-screen.In a nutshell, the monster is definitely a great underrated Drama/Horror film that deserves to be watched at least once."
" Good horror with some incredibly stupid moments
",2017-01-28 00:00:00,7,"OK, without any delays. This movie is definitely worth to watch and not only for horror fans.No spoilers said, this movie could have been very easily in different genre. Delete few scenes and add few more flashbacks and you would get probably the Oscar nominated drama.Movie is separated into two different stories, one from the past and the other happening now. The one from the present is the horror one and the one from the past is something (in my eyes) even more disturbing. Story of one (un)happy family and the life of little girl.Despite not the big budget (I think) most of the movie you will not notice that, very good camera, good acting (except few moments), good scenes and environment, lots of tension which is growing every moment and etc etc...In many cases production ""stole"" good ideas from classic horrors, things like dark, faint sounds, rain in forest, not seeing anything but knowing something is there and the best thing ... not showing the monster!And here we are getting into the one of the two problems of the movie. First problem will appear when they will finally show the monster. Suddenly you would appreciate bigger budget. Its not the worst, I have seen much worse, but still I can imagine something ... And the second thing is the incredible stupid decisions someone (dont want to say who and what) will make.But this is the problem of almost all horror movies, stupid decisions. For example, new Blair Witch (2016), late at night, in the woods, you looking for a witch and you need to pee ... what will you do? You will go alone to take a leak. Or another thing, bonfire is ""dying"" and you need a wood to keep it alive ... what will you do? You will go alone, without telling anyone and you will go so far away, when the trees will be falling down and you will be shouting for your life, no one can hear you!But as I said the movie is ""very"" good, but few things (all of them almost at the end of the movie) will drag it down to average, without these it might have been much, much better"
" An intense drama that uses horror as a metaphor
",2017-01-26 00:00:00,8,"This may be my favorite movie made by Bryan Bertino. I enjoyed the Strangers and Mockingbird, but I believe he has upped his game quite a bit for this film. But understand, this is a drama first, horror second. The movie is very well acted, and it truly makes you feel the depth of the characters, even if they initially seem shallow and spiteful. The dread that accumulates throughout the movie is palpable. But do not expect a horror thrill ride with tons of gore and horror fun. It's actually told as if its a modern day fairy tale, and as fairy tales originally were written with extreme horror elements, but a focus on teaching a moral, so does the Monster. You will definitely see people complain about what they perceive as plot holes, and bad decisions, but they fail to see the metaphor and how its intelligently crafted. This movie is about addiction, and the damage it does not just to yourself, but the people around you.*******major spoiler ahead******** lets talk about the 'bad decision' made in the end of the movie. it becomes clear that the monster is somehow harmed by the light. If the monster is a metaphor for addiction, then the light would be acknowledging the problem or ""bringing it to light"". People that struggle with addiction often do not want their situation to be spoken out loud because then it 'becomes real'. The mother makes the decision to put out a torch, that could have otherwise saved her life, and will definitely leave people upset for making such a stupid decision, especially one with such big consequences. But I argue that it's the most honest, and intelligently written point in the movie. An addict often knows that one more 'dose' could be the one that does them in, and still gives into that temptation or need despite knowing how stupid it is. When she puts out that torch, its like taking that last dose. And the justification in her mind, given at this point of the movie, is giving her daughter a chance to escape. Also understand that this movie once again is told in the form of a fairy tale. With no 'grave decision' made, the tale would hold no weight, or offer no lesson. Its was clear that the story was meant to make you think, rather than just being entertainment. I found it to be very thought provoking, tragic, and honest to the subject matter. don't dismiss this movie because of bad decisions, because its one of the only horror movies I have seen where the bad decision actually fits more honestly to the character and therefor makes it more real and terrifying."
" Good till it starts repeating words over and over
",2017-01-25 00:00:00,3,"I was really getting into this movie till somewhere around the middle of the movie when the two main actors started repeating words over and over. Things like ""It's okay, it's okay"". There was one... Sentence that was just one word over and over around eight or nine times. The repeating is so sickeningly apparent at a point that I almost turned the movie off. It's like the writer had a huge lack of vocabulary and only knew like 10 words in total. Then, the mother makes some stupid choices in life and proves that she is going to make stupid choices till the end. A five year old could have made a better decision. The daughter whines, for good reason, through the first part of the movie and then all of the sudden goes commando. Good start, but man, what a horrible finish."
" Great atmosphere and tone but fails in the end.
",2017-01-24 00:00:00,6,"The Monster is a low budget horror film from the same writer/director Bryan Bertino. From the filmmaker that made an unsettling horror film like The Strangers. Bertino likes to put realistic characters into an unsettling situation all while having a plot that focuses a non-healthy mother/daughter relationship. It follows on a simple plot; an alcoholic/heavy smoker young mother Kathy (Zoe Kazan) is taking her daughter Lizzy (Ella Ballentine) to her fathers. It would be a long drive in a wilderness location. Until they get caught up in a storm, were their car loses control and breaks an axle. Both stuck in the middle of the highway with no traffic. They become stalked by an unknown monster that lurks the woods. What I really liked about The Monster is Bertino does write a powerful emotional script about an irresponsible mother, that verbally and physically abuses her daughter. It also gives a strong performance with a young talented actress like Ella Ballentine. The script follows on realistic characters in real life situations. Then, adding these characters traveling in a distant highway on a rainy night and a monster lurking the area. I also liked that the film did not rely on much CGI on the monster but falling into the old school practical effect on the creature. The whole prosthetic trick displaying the monster, which you do not see in current horror movies. The music composer also put in effort in delivering an unsettling score.The Monster film does have its flaws which Bryan Bertino fails in this and The Strangers. I know how much he likes to write realistic characters. But they make terrible choices when being attacked by the monster. There are moments, were one-person pauses to look at the other for long periods of time when the beast can be lurking just behind or near them. Without giving much away, but a character also makes an illogical decision that could have worked on their defense against the monster. But guessing it would have made the movie a lot shorter, if she did made a smart choice. Also, Scott Speedman has a brief appearance in the film during a flashback as Kathy's boyfriend. An underrated actor, but feels like his role could have extended.The Monster is a fair horror movie that puts realistic characters into a nightmare. The film does lack in being scary as well. And did not have much thrills to put you on the edge of your seat for a horror film."
" slow and a lot of flashbacks but it delivers
",2017-01-23 00:00:00,7,"Is it a horror or is it a story that would like to tell you things and the monster being the bad thing. I don't care. I just watched it as it was and I can agree to both parts but to be honest. I watched it as a horror flick. What I can say is the fact that it isn't a horror for all the geeks walking among us. It's slowly build and it has a lot of flash backs. But it did deliver on a few parts which makes it worth picking up. The acting was above mediocre and to put a teen (Ella Ballentine) in a rather bloody flick,well, she was sublime.That be said, the monster appears after a while and once he's there he do attack. You don't see any gore of the attacks but you do see what is happening with the victims in a messy and bloody way. But all taking place in the woods in the dark it is naturally easy to hide stuff on part of the effects.Still, The Monster is out there so if you are into a bloody flick with our without a message, it's up to you, pick it up, worth 90 minutes of your expensive lives.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5"
" The most depressing horror movie I have ever seen. I wasn't sure whether to be scared or cry. Very much worth seeing.
",2017-01-22 00:00:00,7,"""Dogs don't got teeth like this."" Lizzy (Ballentine) and her mother Kathy (Kazan) have a strained relationship. After a day of screaming and fighting they are finally on the way back to Lizzy's father's. What starts off as a quiet tension filled drive changes when they accidentally hit a wolf. Things get deadly when they realize they aren't alone, but neither knows what they are dealing with. This is a strange movie. On one hand it's a little like Cujo with a mother and child stuck in a car trying to survive. On the other hand, it's one of the most depressing movies I have ever seen. The drama and acting gets you invested in the characters and when they get attacked it means something beyond a cookie cutter monster movie. This is a movie where I wasn't sure what to expect, but I didn't expect this. The movie is a decent watch and worth your time. Overall, the most depressing horror movie I have ever seen. I wasn't sure whether to be scared or cry. I give this a B-."
" Tried to be something a bit more original, but still a highly mediocre movie
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,5,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Monster"" (2016) (how come no one else couldn't have think of that title before!) is highly mediocre monster movie, that tried to be a bit more then just that, but at the end the best thing that i can say about it (and i'm big horror movie fan) is that it is not a bad movie, but everything else in it is just plain average. As a horror movie, its wasn't particularly scary except for maybe a one of two jump scare (gotcha!) scenes. The atmosphere was pretty OK, but is because it take place at night in the middle of nowhere. Acting by mainly only two actresses were OK, especially by a young Ella Ballentine. Script tried to be a bit psychological drama and horror at the same, and basically it was a psychological drama and horror, just not a good one. The monster itself looked kinda fake, i definitely thought that at one scene by the end a human figure was definitely visible...Overall, as a horror movie fan i can not recommend ""The Monster"", nor as movie fan overall. It is not a bad film, but that's the best i can say about it."
" Another pleasant surprise
",2017-01-18 00:00:00,10,"The story of a boozy mother and her precocious daughter is interwoven with a monster movie. Wonderful!The atmosphere is well done. Injured and stranded on the road in the middle of nowhere, on a rainy night, with a monster lurking in the forest nearby, and with help far away... the mother and the daughter are truly stuck in an endless nightmare.I also like the way monster was gradually revealed to the audience. First, a sharp tooth was found from a wolf like being's corpse Then the first time the monster appeared on screen was in the blurry scene of the creature slowly moving behind the girl. Reminded me of ALIEN. You saw something, but you weren't sure what it was. That was brilliant!PS: The mother died in vain. They could have held the torch and escaped together, right? They already discovered that the monster didn't like light.Scott Speedman did an amazing job as Roy. I'll miss Michael Corvin dearly, Mr. Speedman."
" Promising beginning but went downhill
",2017-01-17 00:00:00,5,Well I thought the movie started out well and I thought the young girls acting was really good the story between mum and daughter felt real and enjoyed the scenes between them as heartbreaking some were. I was enjoying the move quite a lot until the middle where the exciting parts should have been happening for me it just went downhill and fast as soon as the monster is revealed and things start to happen it just went a bit silly and really unrealistic. The car guy under the car for ages doing not a lot and the mum waiting in the car for he daughter and not wandering what was taking so long or even bother to try look out of the window whilst she had a wander into the entrance of the woods was unbelievable especially since the child was terrified to even get out the car in the beginning I found it hard to believe when would then go walk to the entrance of the woods after everything that was going on and in the pouring rain and to say sorry to the wolf that they hit with the car was just painful to watch. When they started to get away in the ambulance I was hoping they would escape but out of no where the monsters knocks into the ambulance causing a crash . The fact the mum decided to sacrifice herself if f that's what you call it to save the girl she told her to run when she distracted the monster I was thinking where the hell will she run to on a highway with no cars no people and probably a long stretch of road to nowhere and the girl says she wasn't going to run anyway so she basically died for no reason. The girl lighting a lighter and spraying a tin of flammable spray at the monster igniting it it to a huge ball of fire was the very final straw for me. It's disappointing when a film starts out OK and fairly promising only to then realize you wasted your time watching it me then ten mins having to write this review on how terrible it got . I did give it 5 stars however based on the girls performance I thought in parts was very good and the fact it started out well for me I probably have over rated it but some of the shots of the highway and the woods in the rain were quite nice and set the scary atmosphere of being in the middle of nowhere and vulnerable was believable.
" painfully tedious, loooong and booooooring (may contain spoilers)
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,1,"This movie depicts some very serious issues involving child abuse, alcoholism and child neglect.These issues in themselves would each make entirely separate movies.However, this movie forces itself into painful contortions in an attempt to marry a creature feature together with a weird childhood drama seen from a teenybopper perspective.It literally becomes painful to watch.This is the first movie that I've ever watched where I've found myself so completely longing for the utter vampiric soul draining tedium to conclude.The audience is not given any background on how the generic one dimensional monster that was was seen for a about 2 to 3 minutes during the whole film came into existence.It left the audience scratching their heads after no police ever showed up to a car accident while a tow truck operator ""worked"" under the car for what seemed to be hours.I like the whole concept of sublime randomness but for Heaven's sake, at least make an effort to give such unexpected surprise shifts some purpose and even a little poetry.This movie seemed like one of the longest movies I've ever watched and left me completely drained.Could have been a better movie if it had a theme that made sense and maybe even had a soul. I would have even had a tiny amount of satisfaction had the monster been a metaphor for the family's dysfunction.so, at the end of the day, the first grader's painting is hanging on his mother's fridge and the sun is yellow, the grass is green, the sky is blue and the monster is ...yes ""The Monster""."
" I liked it
",2017-01-14 00:00:00,7,"Sure it wasn't a big budget, but it was very well acted by both the mom (Zoe Kazan)and the daughter (Ella Ballentine). I like the pace and direction of the movie. It didn't have cheap thrill scares, but more of a build up slow burn.I could watch this movie again without getting bored. It lets you know the relationship of the mother daughter and what they go through and what they must overcome.At first I thought this was going to be a cheap werewolf movie, but boy was I wrong. A superb thriller."
